Second, with better local 84 epidemiology data, we predicted that across five regions of Ontario, there may be insufficient resources 85 to resume all elective outpatient cardiac procedures. Finally in the recovery phase, we showed that the 86 estimated incremental growth in waitlist for all cardiac procedures is likely substantial. an approach to modeling coronary artery disease, electrophysiology procedures and valvular 107 heart disease using historic referral and procedural volume data from a provincial clinical 108 registry along with ICU and ward length of stay data from provincial administrative data. Our 109 overall goals were to better understand the consequences of initially curtailing and subsequently 110 resuming cardiac procedures during the pandemic, and to be able to provide timely, data-111 informed predictions to facilitate policy decisions. We provide an example of how such 112 modelling was used through the arc of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, through the initial 113 crisis phase of the pandemic with substantial unknowns, a second phase with local epidemiology 114 data available, and then finally the recovery phase. The cardiac modeling group consisted of a multidisciplinary team of graduate students, clinician-119 scientists, and academics with expertise in cardiology/cardiac surgery, infectious disease, and 120 advanced decision analytic modeling. We engaged our primary stakeholder, CorHealth Ontario 121 to understand the needs of the type of predictions required to make timely policy decisions. (Figure 2A, Supplementary Table S1 ), the increasing rate of 171 COVID-19 cases in Ontario raised substantial concerns that the system was at an inflection 172 point, whereby a surge of critically ill patients could overwhelm the acute care system. 3 We 173 compared the potential deaths from COVID-19 patients in a hypothetical ICU and ventilator 174 shortage scenario to the potential deaths of elective patients waiting for their cardiac procedures. 175",

In the initial crisis phase of the pandemic, there were substantial 94 concerns that available healthcare resources would be overwhelmed. In Ontario, the Ministry of 95 Health and Long-Term Care (MOHTLC) issued a directive on March 16 th , 2020, to all acute care 96 hospitals to halt non-essential procedures in anticipation for a potential surge in COVID-19 97 patients. This included scheduled outpatient cardiac surgical and interventional procedures that 98 required the use of intensive care units, ventilators, and skilled critical care personnel and was 99 broadly consistent with early guidance from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and later 100 recommendations from the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology and the Canadian 101 Society of Cardiac Surgeons. 1,2 While socially responsible, the magnitude of the immediate and 102 long-term consequences of delaying cardiac care is not known. The use of simulation modelling 103 allows one to balance the potential needs of COVID-19 patients against that of delaying non-104 COVID-19 care by explicitly estimating resource utilization and constraints in conjunction with 105 predictions in COVID-19 infection rates and hospitalizations.

The modeling was performed iteratively to 124 contend with the rapid evolution of the pandemic and the model output was assessed at biweekly 125 meetings with stakeholders to inform policy decisions. 126 127 A parallel, open-cohort, dynamic individual-patient-level microsimulation (COvid-19 Resource 128 Estimator, CORE) model to predict hospital resource utilization of COVID-19 patients 129 presenting daily to hospital from the perspective of the Ontario healthcare system was created by 130 researchers and clinicians at the University of Toronto's Covid-19-MC team. 3 An interactive 131 version of the model is publicly available [https://www.covid-19-mc.ca/]. In this model, a daily 132 influx of symptomatic COVID-19 patients (based on patterns of predicted epidemiology at that 133 time) entered the hospital system to compete for a pool of fixed healthcare resources. By running 134 the model over the specified time horizon of the pandemic, this model allowed for the estimation 135 of daily ward, ICU, and ventilators use at the provincial level over the course of the pandemic. 136 Findings from the CORE model were used to set policy and inform technical press briefings by 137 Ontario Health, the MOHLTC and the Ontario Premier's office. 138 139 The CORE model was then adapted to include a cardiac submodule (Figure 1). We chose to 140 examine three areas of cardiovascular medicine with a poor natural history when left untreated: 141 severe symptomatic valvular heart disease requiring open valve surgery or transcatheter aortic 142 valve replacement (TAVR), advanced coronary artery disease requiring revascularization with 143 coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and 144 arrhythmia disorders requiring ablation therapy or implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) device 145 implantation. We did not include heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory support, or cardiac 146 catheterization procedures outside of PCI. 147 148 Our work took place over 3 phases. In the initial \"crisis\" phase of the pandemic, we examined 149 the impact of increasing number of COVID-19 patients under various epidemiological scenarios 150 (expected scenario, worst case, \"Italy scenario\", best case, \"South Korea scenario\"), 3 entering 151 hospitals, requiring the use of cardiac care resources, such as dedicated cardiac ICU and ward 152 beds, and thereby displacing non-COVID-19 cardiac patients. We used epidemiology scenarios 153 from other countries, as that in Ontario was evolving and not known. Nonetheless, pandemic 154 planning was required and could not be delayed till the Ontario epidemiology became apparent. 155 The model estimated unplanned cardiovascular admissions and waitlist mortality for the three 156 modelled cardiovascular disease states based on the published literature. 4 The second phase of 157 our model examined the impact of a policy decision to further curtail elective outpatient 158 procedures (April 5 th , 2020) on an increasing waitlist as the Ontario epidemiology became 159 apparent. The third and on-going phase of the model is recovery, as the Ontario COVID-19 160 pandemic is beyond its peak and currently in a plateau. Our work now focusses on the time 161 required to clear the backlog of outpatient cardiac procedures by modeling various scenarios of 162 the healthcare system's capacity to perform cardiac procedures relative to baseline volume prior 163 to the COVID-19 pandemic. Please see the Supplementary Appendix for further details of 164 methods and the results for each phase. 165 166 Findings throughout the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic 167 168 1 st phase 169 Initial work performed in late March using the CORE model showed that in the worst case 170 COVID-19 transmission scenario",

However, our model suggested that across five regions 188 of Ontario, there may not be sufficient resources to resume all elective outpatient cardiac 189procedures, if cardiac beds remained allocated to COVID-19 patients (Figure 2C). As such, 190CorHealth COVID-19 Cardiac Memo #8 was released on April 13 th and recommended that 191 cardiac centres could resume scheduled outpatient cardiac procedures, restricted to those at 192 highest risk for mortality based on local resource circumstances. We modeled the impact of 193 resumption of cardiac procedures in mid-April at 50% of baseline volumes followed by normal 194 volumes by early May, specifically on the estimated growth in the waitlist (Figure 2D).

            "text": "Summary of modeling implications for policy making 210 211Pandemic planning requires nimble decision making in the face of substantial unknowns. The 212consequences of delaying decisions until local epidemiology data is known with certainty can be 213 catastrophic, as seen in jurisdictions such as Italy and New York, where the systems were 214overwhelmed. Modelling provides decision makers with a credible envelope of potential future 215 scenarios, to aid with difficult decisions. The COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario followed this 216 process. Initial worse case scenarios required an immediate and almost complete shift of the 217 healthcare system to care for those critically ill with the virus, at the exclusion of all but the most 218 gravely ill non-COVID-19 patients. Although reasonable in the short term, once local data was 219 known, it required a strategy shift. Understanding the impact of such a policy is crucial in order 220 to understand the cardiac consequences of the decision and to estimate the size of the potential 221 backlog of cardiovascular procedures so that decisions about resumption of activity can be 222 informed. A unique aspect of this model is that COVID-19 patients and cardiovascular patients 223 compete for shared resources. In essence, this explicitly models the fact that policy decisions 224 regarding cardiac patients cannot be made in isolation from the reality of the pandemic and the 225 needs of COVID-19 patients. are important limitations in decision analytic modeling that must be addressed. First, 230 accurate modeling depends on several factors: a model structure that closely resembles reality, 231 reasonable model assumptions, and relevant inputs. We acknowledge that not every possible 232 scenario can be modeled and there may be important non-fatal outcomes that are relevant to 233 cardiovascular patients that are inadequately represented. Another limitation is that models may 234 be complex and difficult to understand without specialized knowledge or understanding of 235 modeling software. To address concerns about model transparency, we believe such models 236 should be public and to that end, we have provided a detailed supplemental appendix to describe 237 the model structure and assumptions. modelling is not designed to predict the future, but rather to provide decision makers 242 with a credible envelope of possible scenarios. As witnessed in other jurisdictions, in a 243 pandemic, failure to make anticipatory decisions can have dire consequences.
