There may be a restrictive ventilatory defect with reduced D L CO and hypoxemia, which may be severe due to a physiologic shunt Bronchorrhea is indicative of diffuse disease and may be so massive as to cause hypovolemia and prerenal failure with hyponatremia Mucinous BAC consists of columnar cells with round basal nuclei and abundant clear cytoplasm rich in mucin that often form micropapillae. In this variant, which may present as a solitary nodule, multiple nodules or alveolar consolidation (diffuse pneumonitis variant), dissemination often occurs through the airways with the formation of satellite nodules and rapid development of diffuse intrathoracic disease Non-mucinous BAC may exhibit the two distinct cell types of the distal lobule: one is similar to Clara cells, with cuboid or cylindrical eosinophilic cytoplasm with apical projections and PAS-positive granules; the other is similar to type II pneumocytes, and consists of squamoid cells with round nuclei and finely vacuolated or even foamy cytoplasm. The nuclei of either of these cell types may show eosinophilic inclusions surrounded by a clear halo. Dissemination through the airways is rare in this variant Mixed or indeterminate BAC consists of a mixture of mucinous and non-mucinous cells or indeterminate cells which grow along the alveolar walls without invading the stroma Non-mucinous BAC is often associated with central alveolar collapse leading to fibrosis. The fibrosis should not be mistaken for the scars seen at the center of peripheral adenocarcinomas (scar cancer) Diffuse along the alveolar septa It is not uncommon to find foci of adenocarcinoma with stromal invasion associated with features of bronchioloalveolar growth; consequently, the histopathologic diagnosis of a \"pure\" BAC requires extensive sampling to exclude the presence of stromal invasion A four-point grading system for stromal invasion has recently been proposed which has prognostic implications.

Transbronchial lung biopsy may be useful in identifying OP pattern A common BAL pattern in patients receiving amiodarone, whether or not they have lung disease, is the presence of numerous \"foamy\" macrophages. In addition to this, patients with lung disease also have an increase in lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils (mixed alveolitis). The lymphocytes are predominantly of the CD8+ subset. These findings may assist in the diagnosis, although they have no prognostic significance The BAL finding of mixed alveolitis in a patient with amiodarone-induced lung damage is similar to that seen in HP, idiopathic OP and at times NSIP. BAL may be of value in ruling out infection or malignancy ",
