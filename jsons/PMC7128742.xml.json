Briefly, these include [1] how to prevent the disease, [2] how to treat severe cases, [3] how to reduce the medical, social, and economic impact of the illness, and [4] how to end the pandemic. Social distancing measures were rapidly implemented, albeit not uniformly, and other known public health measures such as contact tracing are also variably implemented. Clinical trials are underway using repurposed drugs, new drugs, and new technologically developed antibody drugs. Review of the recently shared preliminary results reveals that most of the data, while valuable, fail to provide definitive evidence of effective lead compounds. Mainly this is because most of these initial studies are observational and not controlled studies. Thus, documented treatment is still lacking. In spite of the paucity of clinical evidences of an unequivocal beneficial effect of chloroquine on COVID-19, the absence of an effective treatment so far, the untimely publicity given to the potential effect of chloroquine and the consequent social and political pressure raised the demand for urgent clinical trials and even resulted in the simultaneous release of the drug for its compassionate use in the treatment of severe cases.",

            "text": "The exact mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against the virus has not been clearly depicted; however, laboratory data show that 4-aminoquinoline compounds (Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) have four mechanisms by which they act against diverse RNA viruses including SARS-CoV1 and reduce the cytokine storm that these viruses can generate.1.\nInhibition of viral entry: Chloroquine interferes with terminal glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which serves as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. In cell culture chloroquine effectively prevents the spread of SARS CoV and works as a prophylactic [12].2.\nInhibition of viral release into the host cell: HCQ is a weak base which rapidly diffuses across membranes of cells and organelles to acidic cytoplasmic vesicles such as endosomes, lysosomes, or Golgi vesicles causing an increase in pH of the organelles. Unlike other enveloped viruses, Coronaviruses bud and assemble at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). 4-aminoquinoline compounds become highly concentrated in organelles causing dysfunction of enzymes including enzymes needed for proteolytic processing and post-translational modification of viral proteins [33]. Experimental data from the Wuhan Institute of Virology demonstrated that chloroquine inhibits the replication of the SARS-CoV-2, in part because of its ability to alkalinize endosomal organelles [18]. Hu et al. [34] have proposed that CQ suppresses phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) and thereby prevents endocytosis-mediated uptake of SARS-CoV-2. There is also data that chloroquine interferes with organelle acidification, which may lead to hindering fusion of viral particles, when chloroquine treatment was used for different emerging or non-emerging virus over the previous five decades: Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-3) [35], Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [36], or H5N1 strain of Influenza A [37].3.\nReduction of viral infectivity: Chloroquine inhibits viral particle glycosylation [38]. The envelopes of coronavirus contain two major glycoproteins the Spike (S) [39] and the Membrane (M) proteins. Lack of proper glycosylation damages the S protein [40], needed for receptor binding.4.\nImmunomodulation: At the cellular level, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit immune activation by reducing signaling by Pattern Recognition Receptors (Toll-like receptor signaling) and cytokine production [1]. Hydroxychloroquine also inhibits the activity of the nucleic acid sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) by interfering with its binding to cytosolic DNA. By preventing TLR signaling and cGAS\u2013stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling, hydroxychloroquine can reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including type I interferons [1]. These drugs also reduce the expression of CD154 (CD40L) on helper T-cells which is essential for a successful antibody response and class switching [41]. These immunomodulatory actions could help prevent the transition from mild or moderate disease to the dreadful acute respiratory distress syndrome by reducing the cytokine storm [42] .\n",

Supply shortage of hydroxychloroquine, which remains needed for standard indications such as Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis should be prevented by a significant effort of pharmaceutical companies, already ongoing, for increasing the production of hydroxychloroquine specifically for COVID-19. Other initiative such as the \u201cDefense Production Act\u201d in the US may be activated.",

If we do not seriously consider using this easy and safe option, we are taking the risk of allowing the pandemic to sore further out of control. As recently stated, the urgency of the epidemic necessitates choices about which interventions to employ. Early HCQ administration to all people at risk of infection from close contact with a positive patient is one of the most reasonable choices. Moreover, it is a choice that could potentially have a considerable impact on the early termination of the COVID-19 epidemic. However, its administration should be done under medical control to avoid potential side effects and to prevent an uncontrolled use leading to supply shortages.",
