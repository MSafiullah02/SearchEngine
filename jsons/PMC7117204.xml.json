            "text": "The U.S. swine industry is the third largest producer of pork in the world, and respiratory disease in pigs is the most important health concern for swine producers today (U. S. Department of Agriculture, 2008). According to the recent survey conducted by the National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS), respiratory disease is on the rise and is the greatest cause of mortality in nursery and grower/finisher swine, making the development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutic interventions that can protect against these infections a top research priority (U. S. Department of Agriculture, 2008). Bordetella bronchiseptica colonization is pervasive in swine herds and is an important contributor to respiratory disease in pigs. It is a primary cause of bronchopneumonia in young pigs, while it additionally contributes to secondary pneumonia in older pigs. It is also the primary etiologic agent of nonprogressive atrophic rhinitis, a mild to moderately severe reversible condition that promotes colonization by toxigenic strains of Pasteurella multocida and can lead to severe progressive atrophic rhinitis (Brockmeier et al., 2012). In swine exhibiting pneumonia, B. bronchiseptica is often isolated in combination with other pathogens (Brockmeier et al., 2012). Previous studies have demonstrated that co-infection with B. bronchiseptica increases colonization and exacerbates the severity of disease caused by both viral and bacterial pathogens, including swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), Haemophilus parasuis, P. multocida and Streptococcus suis(Brockmeier et al., 2012).",

One of the approaches found to be highly discriminatory is multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on comparison of DNA sequences from seven housekeeping genes (Diavatopoulos et al., 2005). The virulent B. bronchiseptica strain KM22 was originally isolated in Hungary in 1993 from a swine herd with atrophic rhinitis. Similar to the majority of B. bronchiseptica strains isolated from pigs exhibiting disease, KM22 is sequence type (ST) 7 in Clonal Complex 1 of an MLST-based Bordetella phylogeny (Diavatopoulos et al., 2005), and it harbors a PvuII ribotype (Register and Magyar, 1999). Additionally, KM22 contains a pertactin repeat region variant (Register, 2001) that is shared with the majority of strains isolated from swine. KM22 has been successfully used by our laboratory to develop a reproducible swine respiratory disease model reflective of clinical B. bronchiseptica infections within swine herds and host-to-host transmission (Brockmeier and Register, 2007, Nicholson et al., 2009, Nicholson et al., 2014a, Nicholson et al., 2012).",

The goal of this study was to compare the genome sequence of KM22 to the complete genome sequence of the laboratory reference strain RB50 to identify genetic features unique to KM22. To gain a broader perspective of the genetic relationship of KM22 among other B. bronchiseptica strains, genetic sequences from KM22 were subsequently compared to five other B. bronchiseptica strains.",

            "text": "Assembly and annotation of the KM22 genome sequence data identified a total of 4853 predicted protein coding sequences (CDSs) (Nicholson et al., 2014b). Upon further investigation, seven CDSs were identified as likely representing a CDS split across two contiguous sequences (contigs) such that the 5\u2032 end of one gene is located at the end of one contig and the 3\u2032 end of the same gene is located at the start of the following contig, with some portion of the middle gene sequence missing, preventing joining of the contigs. PCR primers were designed for each end of the fourteen contigs, and amplification confirmed that each predicated pair was indeed one contiguous region. Additionally, 3CDSs were identified that have sequence homology at the nucleotide and translated protein level with a single large CDS present in RB50 (BB1186) that is homologous to KM22_01212. The three CDSs in KM22 (KM22_04905, KM22_04906 and KM22_04907) each comprise small contigs and align to highly repetitive regions of the RB50 sequence that are missing in the homologous KM22CDS (KM22_01212). Therefore, we believe these three annotated CDSs in KM22 actually comprise various portions of a single gene (KM22_01212) that was not correctly assembled due to the highly repetitive nature of the DNA sequence. As a result, our revised assembly and annotation of the KM22 genome sequence resulted in 4843 unique protein coding sequences in 46 contigs ranging from 679,114 bp to 686 bp, with a total length of 5119,729 bp.",

In three of these regions, the rearrangement is supported by genome sequence assembly data from both strains, such that the position at which the organization changes in KM22 relative to RB50 occurs within a single contig on at least one edge of the region (Fig. 1). The fourth rearrangement identified occurs at contig boundaries such that it is not possible to determine if a true genome rearrangement has occurred at that site or if the contig ordering is incorrect (Fig. 1). Genome rearrangements can have profound phenotypic effects on bacterial niche adaptation by impacting gene expression or loss of gene function resulting from genes located near rearrangement breakpoints being placed under control of new transcriptional regulatory elements (Suyama and Bork, 2001). Genome rearrangements have been previously identified in other Bordetella isolates, including B. bronchiseptica strains (Brinig et al., 2006, Park et al., 2012, Parkhill et al., 2003).

The start codon for the cyaB gene in the KM22 annotation is ATG, which is identical to the start codon for the cyaB gene in the B. pertussis Tohama I annotation (Parkhill et al., 2003). In contrast, the predicted start codon for the cyaB gene in the RB50 annotation is GTG and is located slightly upstream of the predicted ATG start codon for KM22. This ATG codon is present in all the B. bronchiseptica strains, but is not annotated as the start codon. Instead, similar to the RB50 annotation, GTG is located slightly upstream of this ATG and is predicted to be the start codon for the other B. bronchiseptica strains. When this GTG is used as the start codon, it does not encode a full length protein sequence due to a resulting frameshift mutation. This GTG codon only encodes a full length protein sequence in RB50. However, if the conserved ATG is used as the start codon, then a full length protein sequence is capable of being produced by all the B. bronchiseptica strains. Therefore it is possible that the predicted ATG start codon for KM22 is the start codon for the cyaB gene in the other B. bronchiseptica strains and this may also explain the results reported by Park et al. (Park et al., 2012) that strains 1289, D445, Bbr77, and MO149 are beta-hemolytic despite containing a frameshift mutation in the cyaB gene.",

While these major fimbrial subunit genes are unlinked on the chromosome, assembly and secretion of their protein products are mediated by the products of three genes, fimBCD, encoding the usher, the chaperone, and an adhesin, respectively (Locht et al., 1992, Willems et al., 1994). The fimBCD locus is located between the fhaB and fhaC genes, which are required for production and secretion of filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) (Locht et al., 1992, Willems et al., 1994). Similar to RB50, the fimBCD genes were identified in KM22 and located between the fhaB and fhaC genes. A total of eight major fimbrial subunit genes (fimA, fim2, fim3, fimN, fimX, fim2-like KM22_03370, KM22_03368, and KM22_03128) were identified in KM22 and located at unlinked positions along the chromosome. Of the chromosomal regions containing fimbrial subunit genes, we observed the greatest sequence divergence within the fimNX locus. In strain RB50, the fimNX locus contains three genes (fimbrial protein,fimN, fimX), while four genes were identified within this locus in KM22, annotated in order as KM22_03368 (fimbrial protein), KM22_03369 (fimN), KM22_03370 (fim2-like), KM22_03371 (fimX). KM22_03370 is a fimbrial subunit gene identified in KM22 and is not present in RB50. As shown in Supplemental Fig. 3, the gene organization present in the fimNX locus of KM22 is also present in strains 253, Bbr77 and D445. An additional fimbrial subunit gene is annotated at the beginning of the fimNX locus in 1289; however, it is predicted to be a pseudogene.",

The phase-locked mutants and the wild-type KM22 were grown under non-modulating conditions at 37 \u00b0C. With the exception of KM22_03128, the expression of all the fimbrial genes analyzed was decreased in the Bvg\u00af phase-locked mutant, TN30, relative to wild-type KM22, while fimA, fim3, and KM22_03368 were increased in the Bvgi phase-locked mutant TN31 relative to the wild-type KM22 (Fig. 3\n).

The flagellin structural gene flaA encoding the flagellin monomer is present in all strains evaluated in this study and has a range of nucleotide identity relative to RB50 from 99.9% in 253 to 89.1% in strain 1289. An alignment of FlaA predicted protein sequences from all strains reveals that the protein sequence polymorphisms are confined to the middle section of the protein sequence, with the N-terminal and C-terminal sections highly conserved (identical in all 7 strains) (Supplemental Fig. 4). These conserved regions correspond to the N-terminal (pfam00669) and C-terminal region (pfam007000) of other bacterial flagellins, which form packed \u03b1-helix structures. This structural pattern is typical for bacterial flagellin proteins where the conserved termini regions flank a central region that is hypervariable both in residue composition and size (Ramos et al., 2004).

Therefore the phylogenetic relationship among the B. bronchiseptica strains used in our analyses was reconstructed based on single nucleotide polymorphisms in the BvgAS-regulated genes using a Maximum Likelihood method (Fig. 4\n). We were intrigued by the similarity of a phylogeny based on BvgAS-regulated genes (Fig. 4) to one derived from MLST sequences (Supplemental Fig. 1). Both trees contain two distinct sublineages, one that includes all of the isolates from animal hosts (253, 1289, RB50, and KM22) and a second that includes the strains isolated from human hosts. Focusing on the phylogeny based on BvgAS-regulated genes (Fig. 4), the phylogenetic separation among the strains isolated from human hosts (MO149, D445, and Bbr77) was not well resolved based on the low support from the bootstrap values indicated at the nodes; this suggests that mechanisms of diversity, such as recombination, insertions, deletions, or horizontal gene transfer may have occurred within these genes. Although this is a small sample size it is not the first time this observation has been made. Based on SNP densities, Park et al. (Park et al., 2012) recently demonstrated that such mechanisms of diversity, specifically horizontal gene transfer, likely have occurred within the ptx and ptl loci. In addition, recombination could explain why strain 253 is so highly divergent from the other strains of animal origin in the MLST tree (Supplemental Fig. 1), but not in the trees based on the BvgAS-regulated genes (Fig. 4).",

Our hope is that the assembly and annotation of the KM22 genome sequence, coupled with the comparative genomic analyses reported in this study, will help identify genetic elements that could underlie and influence phenotypic differences among the isolates. Together, this information can aid in the development of vaccines with improved efficacy towards B. bronchiseptica in swine to decrease the prevalence and disease burden caused by this respiratory pathogen.",
