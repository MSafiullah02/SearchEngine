Despite this acquired immunity, pregnant women are highly susceptible to P. falciparum malaria. Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) represents a major public health problem, leading to poor outcomes for both mother and infant, including maternal mortality, maternal anaemia, miscarriage, stillbirth, low birthweight, and preterm birth [2\u20137]. In endemic regions, primigravidae are at greatest risk of PAM, and the frequency and density of both placental and peripheral P. falciparum infection decreases with successive pregnancies [3, 8\u201312].",

            "text": "Malaria in pregnancy is characterized by the accumulation of P. falciparum parasitized red blood cells (pRBC) in the placental intervillous space, often observed with macrophage infiltration, fibrinoid, and parasite pigment deposits [13, 14]. Parasites taken from infected placentas display preferential binding to the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) [15], present on the surface of placental syncytiotrophoblasts and intervillous spaces [15\u201317]. This binding phenotype is rarely observed in parasites taken from non-pregnant individuals [15, 18\u201321], which are more likely to bind to receptors CD36 and ICAM-1 in the vascular endothelium. Thus, the parasites that infect pregnant women are understood to constitute a distinct population to those that infect non-pregnant individuals. Parasite binding to CSA on syndecan-1 [22] is mediated by the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family member VAR2CSA [23\u201327], expressed on the surface of pRBC. VAR2CSA is a large (350 kDa) protein with six Duffy-binding-like (DBL) domains (DBL1\u20136) and three interdomain (ID) regions [28\u201330]. The development of protective immunity to PAM over successive pregnancies has largely been assumed to be due to the acquisition of antibodies to VAR2CSA, specifically those that block adhesion to CSA. Two vaccine candidates based on the N-terminal CSA-binding region of VAR2CSA [28] have entered early-stage clinical trials: PAMVAC is comprised of domains ID1-DBL2X-ID2a from the P. falciparum strain FCR3 [31, 32] and PRIMVAC is comprised of domains DBL1X\u2013DBL2X from P.f. 3D7 [33].",

Despite strong evidence for parity-dependent acquisition of antibodies to VAR2CSA, and evidence for a role for VAR2CSA in mediating adhesion to CSA in the placenta, direct epidemiological evidence for a protective effect of VAR2CSA antibodies in preventing PAM and associated adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes has been inconsistent. Furthermore, the specific antigenic targets, and functional responses necessary for protection against malaria in pregnancy and poor birth outcomes has not been established across multiple populations. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies examining associations between antibodies to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens, and pregnancy and birth outcomes including placental malaria, low birthweight, preterm birth, maternal anaemia, and severe malaria. A more comprehensive understanding of the acquired immune response to PAM will inform vaccine development and may help to identify serological correlates of immunity that could be employed in serosurveillance tools.",

For case-control studies, the comparability of cases and controls was assessed. An additional selection bias can occur in case-control studies when cases and/or controls are selected based on criteria relating to their exposure (i.e. antibody) status or there are differences in the reporting of exposure between cases and controls. However, this is unlikely because immunoassays were after enrolment into the study. Information bias (resulting from flaws in measuring antibody and P. falciparum outcome data) is unlikely because antibodies are measured using immunoassays that are standardized within each study and across outcome groups. Furthermore, the quality criterion of this review ensures accurate measurement of maternal and infant outcomes and it is unlikely that measurement of outcomes would differ according to antibody groups. Initially, two authors (JCC and RP) independently assessed bias, with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third review author (FJIF). Risk of bias assessment was collated by JC using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies\u2014of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool (Additional file 4) [46]. The risk of bias assessment pertains to the association between antibody responses and pregnancy and birth outcomes derived from the study, rather than the study itself.",

The random effects meta-analyses were weighted using the inverse of the sum of the individual study sampling variances and a between-study variance component [48].

In all studies, placental infection was confirmed by slide microscopy of placental blood or placental histology. Most studies demonstrated either no difference in the odds of placental infection in antibody responders compared to non-responders, or increased odds of placental infection in antibody responders at delivery (Fig. 2a). Total IgG responders to variant surface antigens (VSA) on CSA-adherent parasite lines had increased odds of placental infection in pooled estimates from cross-sectional studies [35] [61] (reOR = 2.25, 95% CI 0.99\u20135.13, I2 = 46.8%) (Fig. 2a) and in a case-control study (OR 3.91, 95% CI 1.71\u20138.97) [53]. Functional antibodies to CS2 (agglutinating, CSA adhesion inhibitory) were associated with increased odds of placental infection [53] in a Malawian case-control study (OR of 8 and 2.9 fold, respectively). In contrast, a Kenyan cross-sectional study showed that women who had antibodies that could inhibit adhesion of a placental isolate to CSA had a 62% reduction in odds of placental infection (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19\u20130.76) [56] (Fig. 2a). Antibody responders to FV2, and VAR2CSA domains, with the exception of DBL4, had increased odds of placental infection compared to non-responders [42, 52, 59, 60, 63] (Fig. 2a). Estimates for women sub-grouped by parity showed similar patterns of association between antibody responses at delivery and placental infection (Additional file 7: Figures S4A and S5A).\n",

Nine of these studies found that Abs to pregnancy-specific pRBC and VAR2CSA antigens were positively associated with placental infection or placental parasite density [34, 39, 64, 68\u201376, 76], but in some studies, this relationship was restricted to gravidity group, most commonly in primigravidae [34, 68] (Table 2). One study reported no significant difference in total levels of VAR2CSA antibodies at delivery, but higher levels of high avidity Abs to FV2 in women who were negative for placental infection compared to those who were positive for placental infection (Table 2) [65]. A Cameroonian cross-sectional study reported that among malaria-positive women, those with high anti-adhesion Abs had reduced placental parasitaemia, but levels of anti-adhesion Abs were similar between women positive and negative for malaria [38]. To summarize, evidence from studies included in narrative terms suggests that whilst high avidity Abs and anti-adhesion Abs measured at delivery may be associated with protection from placental infection [65] and reduced placental parasitaemia [38], respectively, total IgG responses to VAR2CSA antigens and pregnancy-specific pRBC are positively associated with the presence of placental malaria [34, 39, 64, 68\u201372, 76].",

Of the three cohort studies included in narrative terms, two provided evidence for an association between Ab responses to some, but not all VAR2CSA domains, and pRBC strains, measured earlier in pregnancy, and reduced risk of placental infection [73, 75], and one indicated no difference in Ab levels to VAR2CSA domains measured in first or second trimester (T1/T2) among women who were negative or positive for placental infection (Table 2) [39]. Overall, the majority of estimates included in this review, and studies included in narrative terms, indicate that when measured at delivery, antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC and VAR2CSA antigens are associated with the presence of placental infection and may therefore represent markers of infection, rather than correlates of protection. Of the five studies that measured antibodies earlier in pregnancy, and followed women until delivery, two provided evidence for a protective effect of anti-VAR2CSA antibodies [73\u201375] and three found no significant association with placental infection [42, 55, 59].",

Pooled analyses indicated that compared to non-responders, IgG responders to CSA-binding pRBC, measured at delivery, had a clinically significant 26% reduction in the odds of low birthweight delivery (reOR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.51\u20131.06, I2 = 0.0%), but the confidence interval was wide and captured a scenario of a small increase in odds of low birthweight (Fig. 4a) [61, 62]. Kenyan women with anti-CSA adhesion activity had an 77% reduction in odds of low birthweight birth [56] compared to women who did not have anti-CSA adhesion activity. This association was also observed in sub-group analysis of secundigravidae/multigravidae (Additional file 7: Figure S9A) but not among primigravidae (Additional file 7: Figure S8A), most likely because an insufficient number of women had acquired anti-adhesion activity in their first pregnancy in this study population. In contrast, there was no significant pattern of association between antibody responses to VAR2CSA antigens measured at delivery and low birthweight (Fig. 4a) [42, 60, 62]. Estimates stratified by gravidity gave similarly heterogeneous results for association between antibodies to VAR2CSA at delivery and low birthweight (Additional file 7: Figures S8A and S9A).\n",

Overall, we found that estimates for the association between pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antibody responses and the pregnancy and birth outcomes examined were heterogeneous in terms of both the direction and magnitude of effect. Whilst antibody responses to several antigens were positively associated with the presence of placental and peripheral infections, this review did not identify evidence that any specific antibody response is associated with protection from PAM and its clinical consequences across multiple populations.",

            "text": "Cross-sectional estimates for the association between antibody responses and P. falciparum infections during pregnancy suggest that antibody responses may serve as markers of current infections. Indeed, previous studies have reported a concurrent increase in pregnancy-specific antibodies in women with placental infection [53, 61, 69, 70]. We found that positive antibody responses to pregnancy-specific antigens were associated with increased odds of peripheral infection in some studies, with varying degrees of significance [43, 55, 57, 61]. At delivery, antibody responders (IgG) to the pRBC surface [35, 53, 61], to full-length VAR2CSA (FV2) [52, 60], and to the vaccine candidate ID1-ID2a, which includes interdomain region 1, DBL2X, and interdomain region 2a, had increased odds of placental infection compared to non-responders [42, 52] (Fig. 2a). In contrast, antibodies to single domains (DBL2, DBL3, DBL4, DBL5), measured at delivery, were not associated with placental infection (Fig. 2a). This finding suggests that reactivity to VAR2CSA epitopes in their native formation may be more relevant correlates of disease than responses to individual recombinant domains. Indeed, previous in vitro studies using the full-length extracellular VAR2CSA have suggested that the overall folding of the protein may be important for ability to bind CSA [77, 78]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that functional antibodies to VAR2CSA may have affinity to conformational epitopes not displayed by individual recombinant constructs from single alleles [79]. Further studies designed to measure antibody responses to multiple VAR2CSA antigens concurrently, will be essential to confirm which antibody responses are the best markers of infection and could therefore be utilized as serosurveillance tools [80].",

            "text": "An effective vaccine against placental malaria should induce broadly active and strain-transcending antibodies to block the adhesion of VAR2CSA-expressing parasites to CSA [81, 82]. A single cross-sectional study found that women positive for CSA-binding inhibitory antibodies had significantly decreased odds of placental infection, as well as low birthweight and preterm birth [56]. Although two vaccines based on the N-terminal CSA-binding region of VAR2CSA are currently in early clinical trials, this review highlights a scarcity of evidence for a protective association between antibodies to recombinant VAR2CSA domains, including the vaccine candidates, and placental malaria. Only two prospective cohort studies, included in narrative terms, found that antibody responses to selected VAR2CSA antigens and pRBC were associated with protection from placental infection [73\u201375] and responses to individual recombinant VAR2CSA antigens were associated with protection against low birthweight and preterm birth in individual studies only [27, 73]. None of these studies reported an association between antibodies to the vaccine candidates (ID1-DBL2X-ID2a and DBL1X-DBL2X) and protection from placental malaria, low birthweight, or preterm birth. Interestingly, Malian primigravidae who were positive for antibodies to ID1-ID2a at enrolment (during T2/T3) were more likely to deliver preterm babies, suggesting that this antigen may be a marker of parasite exposure [42]. It is likely that protection from placental malaria and its associated adverse pregnancy outcomes develops with the acquisition of an increasingly broad antibody response to different VAR2CSA domains and allelic variants, rather than to a single domain [74, 75]. Furthermore, high avidity antibodies and functional antibody responses are probably more important measures than simple quantification of IgG responses to recombinant proteins [65, 75].",

A limitation was the heterogeneity observed between estimates, which is likely due to methodological and epidemiological differences between the included studies. We included studies that collectively examined a broad range of antibody responses, including to the surface of pRBC isolates from infected placentas, to CSA-binding pRBC strains, and to recombinant VAR2CSA antigens. With respect to the antigens examined, parasite isolates differed in their geographical origin and recombinant antigens varied by allele, domain boundary, and expression system (Additional file 6), potentially impacting variation in antibody reactivity between studies [83, 84]. Importantly, the influence of the global genetic diversity of the var2csa gene on antibody reactivity, and consequently, vaccine development, has not been adequately determined [84]. Furthermore, inconsistencies in estimates across studies may reflect a dual role for antibodies to VAR2CSA, whereby antibodies contribute to protective immunity via blocking of pRBC adhesion to CSA, but also contribute to local pathology by activating inflammatory monocytes and macrophages in the placenta [85, 86]. In addition, differences in the methodology employed to measure antibody responses may have contributed to heterogeneity in estimates. Furthermore, due to the limited availability of stratified data, we only presented estimates for women sub-grouped into primigravidae and secundigravidae/multigravidae groups. In some earlier studies, antibodies to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens were associated with improved pregnancy outcomes in secundigravidae only [56], or in women with chronic pregnancy-associated malaria infections [61]. Therefore, further studies examining antibody responses in specific parity and clinical groups may be warranted.",

We identified a lack of cohort studies examining associations between antibody responses and prospective risk of malaria in pregnancy. The majority of the included estimates were derived from cross-sectional analyses, usually at delivery, thus limiting the ability to establish a causal relationship between antibody responses and PAM outcomes. Moreover, measurements of immunity inferred by antibody levels at a single time point can be misleading as antibody production is highly dynamic [39, 51, 57, 87].

Both parity and transmission intensity can influence the kinetics of anti-VAR2CSA antibody responses during pregnancy [35, 38, 39, 73]. Moreover, the transmission intensity may affect the relationship between antibody responses and PAM [74, 75] as women living in areas of stable/intense malaria transmission may develop a broader repertoire of functional antibody responses to pregnancy-associated P. falciparum earlier in pregnancy, than women facing low/seasonal transmission [74]. Because antibody responses to the same antigen were rarely examined across multiple populations using comparable study designs, it was difficult to assess the effect of transmission intensity. Understanding the impact of transmission intensity on acquired immunity has implications for both serosurveillance and vaccine development.",

            "text": "Overall, this systematic review found that pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antibody responses likely serve as markers of exposure to malaria in pregnancy, rather than correlates of protection. In order to objectively identify and prioritize antigens for vaccine development, it is important to demonstrate that a candidate antigen is a specific target of immune responses associated with protection from symptomatic disease in naturally exposed populations [88, 89]. Rational vaccine design and the development of immuno-serosurveillance tools would benefit from additional prospective cohort studies examining antibody responses early in pregnancy and at multiple time points throughout to a broad range of pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens across different epidemiological settings.",

Authors reported that all PM\u2212 women had been exposed to malaria since they had Ab to DBL5 iInfected women were individually matched by gravidity, age (\u00b1 2 years), and date of delivery (\u00b1 2 months) to women without evidence of current or previous placental infection according to the results of placental histological analysis and placental, peripheral, and cord blood smears, and/or to women with evidence of past placental infection (malaria pigment present by placental histological analysis but no parasites seen, together with negative placental, peripheral, and cord blood smears) jPregnant women who were blood film positive and diagnosed with one or more of the following clinical manifestations were categorized as having SM (n = 39): severe anaemia, haemoglobin levels < 7 g/dL; cerebral malaria, unrousable coma; hypoglycaemia, blood glucose levels < 40 mg/dL; hypotension, systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg; jaundice, physical diagnosis or bilirubin levels > 3 mg/dL and hyperparasitaemia, > 10,000 parasites/\u03bcl. Pregnant women who were parasitaemic without these features were defined as uncomplicated malaria (UM; n = 41). An additional 41 pregnant women with negative blood films and no signs of clinical malaria were enrolled as uninfected controls.
