It has the biological activity of thymopoietins and influences the immune system by promoting the differentiation of thymocytes and affecting the function of mature T-cells. Tp5 has been used as an immunomodulator for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/cancer immunodeficiency, and other primary immunodeficiencies.4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9. However, the half-life of Tp5 is about 30 s and in clinic, it has been used via intramuscular administration, which often induces inconvenience in patients. In this sense, to develop a Tp5 oral delivery system is of great scientific and practical significance.",
