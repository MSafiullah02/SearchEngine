In a competition binding assay, synthetic peptides (D07 and D08) and S2 protein inhibited the anti-S2-mediated adhesion of PBMCs to A549 cells (Fig. 5b) . (b) Binding ability of SARS patient sera to spike peptides. SARS patient sera (from a pool of five patients) or healthy control sera (from a pool of five healthy controls) were 1 : 20 diluted and added to the wells coated with spike protein S2 domain, D02, D03, D07, or D08 peptides. ELISA was performed for the detection of the binding activity of patient or healthy control sera to these peptides. Experiments were carried out in duplicate, and the averages are shown.

SARS patient sera or healthy control sera were preabsorbed with 10 mg S2, D02, D03, D07, or D08 peptides overnight at 4 \u221eC before incubated with A549 cells.

SARS patients develop an atypical form of pneumonia. Among the changes observed in the lungs of SARS patients are epithelial cell proliferation and desquamation, hyaline membrane formation along alveolar walls, and immune cell infiltration during the early stage of the disease, and increased fibrosis and multinucleated epithelial giant cell formation during a later stage. The increasing viral load suggests an effect caused by viral replication in the early phase [11] . In addition, proinflammatory cytokine production and dysregulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of SARS [12, 15, 16, 26] . One study documented IgG seroconversion in 93% of the patients at a mean of 20 days. The timing of IgG seroconversion, which started on day 10, correlated with falls in viral load, which occurred between days 10-15, when several clinical worsenings, which cannot be explained by uncontrolled viral replication, occurred. The lung damage at this phase is therefore related to immune-mediated pathological effects [11] . In the present study, we showed that autoAb production is also involved in SARS-CoV infection. The autoAbs, mainly IgG, started to appear on day 20. Viral infections have been associated with the development of autoimmune diseases [30] . Most autoimmune disorders are chronic diseases, but there are several acute autoimmune responses that are initiated shortly after infection. Structural similarities between viral proteins and selfantigens have long been proposed as targets for immune cross-reactivity associated with the initiation of autoimmunity. We have reported this phenomenon in dengue virus infection and hypothesized its role in the immunopathogenesis of dengue virus-induced dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [31] [32] [33] [34] . Our finding that antiepithelial cell autoAbs are produced after SARS-CoV infection is another example of acute viral infection-induced autoimmunity. Both viruses have some characteristics in common: both are lymphotrophic; the infections cause high fever, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, haemorrhage, and mild hepatitis; cytokine storm occurs in the acute phase; and molecular mimicry exists between virus proteins and selfantigens. Mouse CoV infection induces B cell polyclonal activation and the generation of autoAbs [23, 24] . Although autoAb production in SARS patients causes cytotoxicity to A549 cells (type-2 pneumocytes), whether the autoimmune response may act as a pathological factor in SARS disease needs further investigation. Interestingly, the elevated Ab titre was associated with the aggravation of respiratory failure [35] . In addition to Ab-mediated cytotoxicity, the release of chemokines and cytokines by A549 cells has been detected. Our preliminary results indicated an increase in the production of IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1a and MIP-1b after anti-S2 stimulation (unpublished data).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 571, "end": 575, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 689, "end": 693, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 694, "end": 697, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 698, "end": 701, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 702, "end": 705, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1124, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1362, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1872, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1873, "end": 1877, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1878, "end": 1882, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1883, "end": 1887, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2413, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2414, "end": 2417, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2726, "end": 2730, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Recent reports [36, 37] have shown that the SARS-CoV spike protein might elicit the protective Ab responses in mice. The neutralizing effect of anti-SARS-CoV spike Abs was demonstrated. Based on our results by sequence comparison from the NCBI protein database, however, several regions of SARS-CoV spike protein show sequence homol- (a) Effect of anti-S2 Abs and IFN-g on PBMC adherence to epithelial cells. A549 cells were cultured in 8-well glass chamber slides and treated with 25 ng of IFN-g for 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS, and then cocultured with fresh human PBMC for 1 h in the presence or absence of 1 : 50 dilution of anti-S2 hyperimmune sera. Cell adhesion was observed using Liu's stain. The numbers of adherent cells were quantified in each tested culture. (b) Blockage of PBMC adherence to epithelial cells by spike peptides. Anti-S2 hyperimmune sera were preabsorbed with 10 mg S2, D02, D03, D07, or D08 peptides at room temperature for 2 h before incubated with A549 cells. After 1 h at 37 \u221eC, fresh human PBMC were added and the rest of procedures were followed as described in (a).

We have identified several candidate proteins recognized by SARS patient sera and anti-SARS-CoV spike Abs, including annexin II, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, albumin, a1antitrypsin, aldo-keto reductase, and transferrin (manuscript in preparation). The local alignment by Java-European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (JEMBOSS)-Water analysis showed that these proteins have a high degree of homology with the spike peptide sequences of D07 and D08 located in S2 portion. Recombinant S2 protein or the spike peptides D07 and D08 blocked the binding of SARS patient sera to A549 cells. Furthermore, murine anti-S2, but not S1, antisera can bind A549 cells. These results suggest that anti-SARS-CoV Abs can recognize the cross-reactive epitope on human lung epithelial A549-cell proteins by molecular mimicry between spike proteins and self-antigens. The epitope for neutralizing Abs is in the S1 domain [38, 39] , while the cross-reactive Abs recognize the epitope on the S2 domain of spike protein. Analysis of Ab expression profile from SARS patient sera used in this study indicated that anti-S2 IgG started to appear around day 20, while antinucleocapsid (N) IgG could be detected around day 10 [40] . This is consistent with the previous report that IgG seroconversion started on day 10 [11] and with our findings that the autoAbs, which are mainly anti-S2 IgG, appeared on day 20. The onset of autoimmune responses in SARS-CoV infection may have important implications. It is still not clear why intense lung inflammation develops even after the viral load has dropped two weeks after the onset of fever. The virus itself and virus-induced cytokine production might be responsible for the early stage of lung epithelial cell damage, while the late autoAb-mediated or infiltrating cell-mediated inflammation causes continued and sustained alveolar damage and fibrosis. In addition to A549 cells, other cell types, including endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and fibroblasts, were also bound by autoAbs in SARS patients. The autoAb production caused by the molecular mimicry between selfantigens and the spike protein of SARS-CoV might relate to the systemic effects and the sequelae of SARS disease [41] . Furthermore, the binding of immune cells with lung epithelial cells, which is accelerated by the combination of IFN-g and anti-S2, may contribute to the inflammatory responses associated with SARS pathogenesis. This hypothesis needs to be further tested. Studies on the role of autoAbs will be crucial to gain an insight into SARS immunopathologic mechanism.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 15, "end": 19, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 20,
