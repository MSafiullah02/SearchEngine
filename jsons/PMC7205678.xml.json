The state of Georgia has 159 relatively small counties, making it possible to assess the impact of different distancing policies in neighboring counties. The authors present an example using these hyperlocal data in the state of Georgia.",

The policy was adopted on March 19 and implemented on March 20, 2020. These measures were not adopted by any surrounding counties except for one neighboring county (Oconee) that implemented a similar policy on March 24, 2020. A statewide SIP policy was not implemented until April 3, 2020.2 This variation in SIP policies at this hyperlocal level created a natural experiment prior to the statewide policy change, allowing examination of the relationship between SIP policy implementation and case doubling rates for Clarke (treatment county) versus surrounding counties (control group).",

A more rapid and larger increase in doubling time was observed following implementation of mandatory distancing than in the surrounding counties. Authors used the xtreg procedure in Stata, version 16.1, to fit a fixed effects linear regression model using doubling time as the dependent variables and distancing policy as the independent variable. The policy variable was estimated in in two ways: (1) using only local data and (2) adding statewide data. The local model showed a mean increase in doubling time of 11.3 days in Clarke Countycompared with surrounding counties. Incorporating state data still found an increased doubling time by a mean of 8.0 days. The authors performed a sensitivity analysis by creating a model using the percentage daily increase in cases as the dependent variable, and found results consistent with the other models: a 30% decrease in the percentage increases in Clarke compared with surrounding counties.",

However, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, such as the unemployment rate, uninsured rate, and median income, of the region are similar across the seven-county region (with the exception of Oconee county, which has higher concentrations of wealth, education, and access to care).3, 4, 5\n",
