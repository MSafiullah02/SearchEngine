This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA 44 in placental or membrane samples.

Given the 46 mixing of maternal and fetal fluid and tissue at time of delivery, the origin of the detected 47 SARS-CoV-2 RNA in our series is unclear. It may represent contamination from 48 maternal blood, amniotic fluid, or COVID-19 infection of the membranes and amniotic 49 sac. For those infants who were delivered vaginally, contamination with vaginal 50 secretions is also a possible source, although prior studies on vaginal secretions have 51 failed to demonstrate the presence of COVID-19. 5,6 52",
