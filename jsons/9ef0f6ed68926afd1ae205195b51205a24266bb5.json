            "text": "Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are difficult to diagnose emergencies. Plasma soluble ST2 (sST2), a prognostic biomarker for heart failure, has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker of AASs outperforming D-dimer, the current diagnostic standard. We performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of sST2 for AASs in the Emergency Department (ED). In 2017-2018, patients were enrolled if they had \u22651 red-flag symptoms (chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit) and a clinical suspicion of AAS. sST2 was detected with the Presage \u00ae assay. Adjudication was based on computed tomography angiography (CTA) or on diagnostic outcome inclusive of 30-day follow-up. 297 patients were enrolled, including 88 with AASs. The median age was 67 years. In 162 patients with CTA, the median sST2 level was 41.7 ng/mL (IQR 29.4-103.2) in AASs and 34.6 ng/mL (IQR 21.4-51.5) in alternative diagnoses (P = 0.005). In ROC analysis, the AUC of sST2 was 0.63, as compared to 0.82 of D-dimer (P < 0.001). Sensitivity and specificity values of sST2 associated with different cutoffs were: 95.5% and 10.8% (\u226512 ng/mL), 84.1% and 29.7% (\u226523.7 ng/mL), 35.2% and 85.1% (\u226566.5 ng/mL). Results were similar in the full cohort. In conclusion, in patients from a European ED, plasma sST2 provided modest accuracy for diagnosis of AASs.",

            "text": "Acute aortic syndromes (AASs), which include acute aortic dissection (AAD), intramural aortic hematoma (IMH), penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) and spontaneous aortic rupture (SAR), are severe cardiovascular emergencies affecting 5-10 per 100.000 individuals a year 1 . A conclusive diagnosis of AASs requires advanced aortic imaging, typically computed tomography angiography (CTA), which uses ionizing radiations and may cause contrast-induced nephropathy and anaphylaxis. However, selection of the right patient to image with CTA is cumbersome, because AASs present with unspecific symptoms such as truncal pain, syncope, neurological deficits and hindlimb ischemia. These are leading causes of Emergency Department (ED) visits worldwide, and most patients with these symptoms are affected by more common conditions, such as acute coronary syndromes, gastrointestinal diseases and muscle-skeletal pain. Hence, the misdiagnosis rate of AASs is high, affecting clinical outcomes 2-4 . Increasing use of CTA in EDs has led to a high number of CTA exams requested for suspected AAS turning out negative, but has not substantially changed misdiagnosis rates, indicating that pre-test patient selection remains a key node 5-7 . Development of reliable diagnostic biomarkers discriminating AASs could positively impact on their diagnostic workup, as for other cardiovascular emergencies such as acute coronary syndromes and pulmonary embolism 8, 9 .",

Currently, D-dimer is the only biomarker clinically applicable to the workup of AASs 11,12 . Owing to high sensitivity, D-dimer can be used for diagnostic rule-out of AASs, if the pre-test probability is sufficiently low 13 . However, D-dimer can be increased by several conditions such as inflammation, infection, cancer, trauma and age, leading to low diagnostic specificity. On these grounds, the quest for additional diagnostic biomarkers for AASs remains open and vibrant.

The role of sST2 within vascular tissues and in the context of aortic disease is largely unknown 20 . However, Wang et al. recently reported that plasma sST2, measured with a research-grade assay, showed striking diagnostic accuracy for AASs and outperformed D-dimer, in a Chinese patient cohort 21 . Since plasma sST2 levels can be measured with a clinical-grade assay already approved for patient use, we sought to further evaluate it as a diagnostic biomarker for AASs in an independent prospective cohort of acute patients from a European ED.",

Indeed, a recent study has reported significant variation in sST2 levels related to age, with 50 years as a critical cutoff 22 . Major differences in age between the present and the previous study may account for the discrepancy. Second, male gender has also been associated with higher sST2 levels. However, since gender distribution was similar between the two studies, this should not be regarded as a major confounder. Third, ethnic differences in sST2 levels between Asian and European populations may exist. Indeed, the lowest diagnostic accuracy estimates for D-dimer have been obtained in Asian studies 23 . Finally, the present study used a different assay for detection of sST2, i.e. the only one approved for patient use 24 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ results of the research-grade R&D assay and the clinical-grade Presage assay strongly correlated.

Since the study was performed in a tertiary ED specialized in cardiovascular emergencies, variation of physician's gestalt and local practice might limit result generalizability. Second, due to ethical and clinical considerations (exposure to radiation and contrast medium), CTA could not be performed as uniform gold standard. Treating physicians decided on CTA based on patient-level clinical reasoning irrespective of study participation, in compliance with an observational and non-interventional study protocol. A follow-up approach was used for pragmatic case adjudication based on 30-day outcomes. This method is routinely applied in diagnostic studies of cardiovascular emergencies in the ED such as pulmonary embolism and acute coronary syndromes and has been used in a previous multicenter study of AASs 12, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . As compared to our previous work, the timeline of the follow-up was extended from 14 to 30 days, in order to fully cover both the acute and subacute phases of AASs. Very few patients with clinically mild forms of AASs (e.g. short uncomplicated IMHs or PAUs) might have been misdiagnosed. However, they could not substantially affect the study results.

During the ED visit, patients underwent venipuncture for the routine blood tests deemed necessary by the attending physician. Blood samples were immediately sent to the local laboratory for automatic processing. D-dimer levels were measured urgently by the laboratory on trisodium citrate-plasma samples, using the STA-Liatest D-Di assay (Stago, Asni\u00e8res sur Seine, France). This is a rapid, automated, quantitative immune-turbidimetric quantitative assay. The results of the D-dimer assay were available live to the attending physicians, for clinical decisions. For sST2 measurement, for each patient an EDTA-plasma sample aliquot was rapidly obtained in the laboratory and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing.
