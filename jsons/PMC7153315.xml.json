            "text": "Biological weapons are refers to those which contain replicating infectious and lethal forms of life including bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, prions, or poisonous chemical toxins produced by living organisms (Rogers et al., 1999). Biological warfare agents (BWAs) as bioweapons have been widely used in wars because of their easy availability, low production costs, easy transportation and dispersal, and nondetection by basic security systems. Biowarfare agents are responsible for the spread of human diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Further, these agents can multiply in the host organism and get transmitted to others individuals, causing erratic consequences, which lead to mass geographical spread. Due to low production costs and easy cultivation, any developed or under developed country can afford their manufacturing and maintenance. These are available in liquid as well as in dry forms with extensive storage life. People who have not previously encountered these biowarfare agents usually do not have any natural immunity in their body against these agents, thus are highly prone to infections. Moreover, in comparison to common human diseases, the etiological agents causing these deadly diseases have highly hostile animal reservoirs (called zoonotic in nature) and are difficult to diagnose and cure. The nature, properties, and lethal effects caused by many zoonotic biological agents that have been used for biowarfare purposes over the years and have led to serious epidemiological outbreaks, are summarized in Table 1\n.",

Following the historical pattern of biological terror attacks and disease outbreaks, it can be concluded that biotechnology has accidently unleashed a new threat to mankind in the form of virulent bioweapons to inflict mass causalities and devastation (Lesser et al., 1999). So, highly efficient and cost-effective medical countermeasures based on ethnic specificity of the biological agent need to be developed with the purpose of bio-preparedness and biosecurity (Horn, 2003; Jansen et al., 2014; Pal et al., 2016). Associated risks with human pathogens must be evaluated on the basis of rate of mortality, availability of treatment and prophylactic measures, need for hospitalization, public perception, and epidemiological spread (Rotz et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Any documentation related to history of biological warfare is difficult to extract from the literature since all the allegations are based solely on eye-witness accounts and circumstantial evidence after the event. Moreover, the allegations in most of the cases have been denied by the accused parties. In 1155 AD, at a battle in Tortona, Italy, Barbarossa broadened the scope of biological warfare by using the dead bodies of soldiers as well as animals to pollute wells. During war with the French in 18th century, British forces under the direction of Sir Jettray Ahmest gave blankets that had been used by smallpox and yellow fever victims to the native Americans in order to spread disease (Frischknecht, 2003). During the US civil war, in 1863 AD, General Johnson used dead bodies of sheep and pigs to pollute drinking water at Videsburg, Mississippi. During World War I, in 1915, the first allegation was made against the Germans that they had attempted to employ the biological agents of Cholera against Italy and Plague against Britain. Later, in 1916, they were accused of using Anthrax at Bucharest, Romania (Metcalfe, 2002). The first incidence of biological warfare was documented during World War I when millions of deaths were recorded due to pandemic outbreak of The 1918 Spanish Influenza virus (H1N1) that triggered naturally. This was the most striking example of indirect offense where a disease causing biological agent was used to deteriorate combat capabilities of enemy forces at the war front. This perhaps led to the establishment of the concept of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism. The period from 1940 to 1969 can be considered as the golden age of biological warfare research and development. In the last few decades, several incidences of bioterrorism/biological warfare were recorded (Ainscough, 2002).",

As a rapidly evolving super power, the FSU initiated its biological warfare program during the mid-1960s to 1970s, when they started showing interest in genetics and genetic manipulations of potential human pathogens. Despite being a signatory member of the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapon Convention (BTWC), the FSU developed highly potent and deadly chimeric biological warfare agents. Extensive research was carried out to weaponize the developed agents to powder or aerosol formulations for direct loading into munitions such as spray tanks and cluster bombs. The first genetically engineered vaccine tolerant pathogen Francisella tularensis, causing tularemia, was established under the \u201cEnzyme\u201d program during the 1950s to 1960s, which modernized the concept of biological warfare. Until 1992, they had a repository of 52 highly contagious strains that could overcome all the barriers of immune systems and current medical treatments. Anthrax strain 836, Pasechnik\u2019s superplague strain, glanders strain, myelin toxin forming Yersinia pestis, tularemia (Schu S-4), and viruses like Ebola, Marburg and influenza are only a few to name them. They also tried their hands at the production of chimeric viruses by introducing genetic elements from Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV), Ebola (EBOV), and Marburg (MARV) into native smallpox virus (Ainscough, 2002).",

Introduction of antibiotic resistant genes in pathogenic strains can significantly enhance lethality of disease by reducing treatment options (Athamna et al., 2004). Similarly, the prophylactic effects can be circumvented by suppression of the immune system through the expression of immune modifier genes using viral vectors, e.g., expression of mouse interlukin-4 in recombinant Ectromelia virus suppresses immune functions of the host and overcomes genetic resistance to mouse pox. In 1998, a DNA sequence based investigation on the preserved samples of 11 victims revealed simultaneous occurrence of 4 distinct virulent variants of B. anthracis, showing the continuation of a biological warfare program, which was reportedly denied from time to time by FSU. Surprisingly, genetic manipulation procedures were adopted to enhance resistance of the existing etiological agents to high temperature and the available range of therapeutic antibiotics and prophylactic measures, and to make novel immune-suppressive agents that could be easily weaponized when needed. These facts indicate the violation of 1972 BTWC by FSU, as they were continuously engaged in developing designer lethal agents, which they might have integrated into their special war plans (Ainscough, 2002).",

Later, a lower level bench scientist in Pasechnik\u2019s lab, referred by the code name \u201cTemple Fortune,\u201d also defected to the United Kingdom, 3 years after the defection of Dr. Pasechnik, where he replicated his previous account of a biowarfare program and then disclosed it to the British government. In late 1992, Dr. Kanatjan Alibekov (now known as Ken Alibek) became the third defector from the Russian biowarfare program (Mangold and Goldberg, 1999; Tucker, 1999; Ainscough, 2002). In 1999, Alibek\u2019s article on \u201cBiohazard\u201d narrated his first-hand experience as a member of the FSU program and emphasized the extensive research and development of genetically manipulated biological warfare agents, large scale production facilities, weaponization of BW agents, defensive measures, and future BW goals of the Russian Government (Alibek, 2008). Former USSR president Mikhail Gorbachev (1990\u201391) and, later on, Russian president Boris Yeltsen (1991\u201399) had announced the termination of their biowarfare programs in the early 1990s.

Soon after the September 11 terror attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon in 2001, anthrax-laced letters were sent to national legislators of the United States, which resulted in the spread of terror among civilians and triggered the adoption of prophylactic measures by communities on a mass scale. These two events were sufficient to sensitize President Bill Clinton to extract deficiencies in the US national security and resulted in the establishment of The Homeland Security Council to co-ordinate efforts of the existing national agencies and organizations to overcome future security challenges (Ainscough, 2002).",

Campbell at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC described the possible application of genetically modified fungi to destroy military paints in 72 h. The second evidence came to light in 1990, when the United States started conducting field trials on pathogenic Pleospora papaveracea strains against the drug producing crop, opium poppy. Potential risks were successively tested by evaluating crop destruction in 2001 in Tashkant, Uzbekistan. Similarly, pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum strains were developed in the United States to destroy coca plants with field test scheduled to be held in Columbia, 2001. However, worldwide protest against field trials on pathogenic destruction of drug producing (cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine) cash crops produced strong public opposition leading to termination of the project. The third evidence came from the use of psychoactive substances (sleeping gas- BZ) as biological weapons in the Moscow hostage crisis in 2002, which caused death of more than 170 people. The US Marine Corps also investigated the military usefulness of benzodiazepines and alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists as potential weapons. Other BTWC signature states have developed potential biowarfare agents through extensive research and development, but as far as their delivery is concerned, it is still in its infancy as compared to weaponization of biowarfare agents by FSU (Van Aken and Hammond, 2003).",

Out of a total of eight genes, hemeagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and polymerase B1 (PB1) were considered important virulent factors contributing to the severity of the disease. Sixteen different variants were reported for HA antigens, mainly aglycoproteins in nature that help in attachment of virus to the host cell, while nine subtypes of NA, antigenic glycoproteins, were reported in humans and animals, with N1 and N2 linked to epidemics in man and others, specifically, for ducks and chickens. HA type-5 (HA5) and NA type-1 (N1) are important components of viral capsids required for assembly of infectious viral particles. Neuraminidase activity is important to release replicated viruses from the infected host cell. The Spanish Flu virus probably originated in birds, and evolved to cause the 1918 epidemic.",

SARS-CoV disappeared in July 2003, as rapidly as it had emerged in 2002. Bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV and none of the human in vitro culture systems supports viral replication. The possibility of human adaptation of bat SARS-CoV was studied using synthetic SARS-CoV viral cDNA.

This was the example of the largest retroviral genome (approx. 30 kb) capable of replicating and infecting human cells. It is suspected that SARS-CoV may re-emerge again, and might be even more deadly than the previous form, due to the possibility of cross species transmission of virulent characters to existing repertoire of coronavirus infecting other mammals like civets (Li et al., 2005; Becker et al., 2008).",

Inside the capsid, the positive-sense strand of the virus genome is packaged and replicated to form dsRNA. P4 ATPase comprises a hexameric multifunctional unit (lined with a helix \u03b16 and loops L1 and L2) that plays an important role in procapsid assembly and ssRNA packaging. During infection, it acts as a passive channel for the extrusion of newly synthesized mRNA molecules from the virus. The genome of \u03c612 encloses three segmented dsRNAs, each comprising a positive strand sequentially recognized by the procapsid, which undergoes conformational changes to accommodate all the RNA segments. The loops L1 and L2 are vital for RNA binding and translocation. The phosphate-binding P-loop upon ATP hydrolysis changes its confirmation from \u201cdown\u201d to \u201cup\u201d form, accompanied by similar transition of \u03b16 and loop L2 from \u201cup\u201d to \u201cdown\u201d position, signifying the driving force for RNA translocation. The arginine finger of hexameric ATPase motors plays an important role in sequential ATP hydrolysis, inducing conformational changes that direct the trans arginine finger to active center of ATPase (neighboring subunit), thus triggering the successive ATP hydrolysis.",

The packaging motor protein has two domains, i.e., N-terminal ATPase domain and C-terminal nuclease domain, which are linked together by small amino acids to provide the flexibility to the motor to ensure packaging. ATP hydrolysis is triggered upon dsDNA binding to C-terminal domain (gp17 subunit) and thereby positioning the cis \u201carginine\u201d finger of N-terminal domain into the ATPase active center that further results in subsequent conformation changes. These changes align opposite charges of both N- and C-terminal domains that pull C-terminal domain towards N-terminal domain by the action of electrostatic forces, leading to packaging two base pairs of dsDNA (Sun et al., 2010).",

Further, co-infection with helper virus (like adenovirus or herpes simplex virus, HSV) assists its replication with host cell polymerase (Ni et al., 1994). An in vitro course of action for the packaging of AAV was studied by Zhou and Muzyczka (1998). Synthesis of an infectious AAV particle was done by using its replicative-form of DNA as a substrate, AAV Rep, and capsid proteins in order to transfer recombinant gene to mammalian cells. Two types of products formed, both were heat-resistant, indicating an appropriate ratio of protein-to-DNA. In addition, products also share structural resemblance of mature AAV particles. An efficiently synthesized particle enclosing intact terminal repeats always shows chloroform, DNase I, and heat-resistance, pertaining to an authentic AAV particle. Resistance is known to be a vital property for packaging purposes. However, nonpathogenic and persistent nature, in combination with its broad range of infection, as reported by Wright and coworkers, marked this virus as an imperative nominee for a therapeutic gene transfer vector (Wright et al., 2003).",

Antibodies bind to specific antigens present on the surface of the cell and form a colored or detectable complex, which ultimately marks the presence/detection of a bioagent in the sample. Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) has been mainly used for quantitative detection of antigen following the basic principle of immunoassays. ELISA has been widely used for diagnosis of several diseases and simultaneous screening of large number of samples. Thus, the technique is highly efficient, economical, and reliable. To date, ELISAs have been successfully employed for the detection of biowarfare agents such as B. anthracis, B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, Brucella abortus, Ebola virus, F. tularensis, Marburg virus, toxins, and Y. pestis. Besides these, fluorescent microscopy has also been used for biowarfare agent detection, where a fluorescent labeled antibody attached to antigenic receptors present on the surface of the microbial cells aids in its detection. Immuno-histochemical based methods have also enabled detection of some viruses such as Alphaviruses and Chikanguniya viruses (Wang et al., 2008). Other immunoassay, namely, hand-held immuno-chromatographic assays (HHIAs), are also used for detection of biowarfare agents such as B. anthracis, B. abortus, B. pseudomallei, botulinum, F. tularensis, smallpox virus, Ricin toxin, variola virus, and Y. pestis. HHIAs are cost-effective, simple, rapid, and are performed on nitrocellulose or nylon membranes and are based on lateral flow immunoassays.

In recent years, NGS technologies have gained much importance and validation as an effective biodefense strategy due to their highly specific and rapid detection capabilities. NGS techniques have been applied for B. anthracis detection in air and soil samples. Strain-specific polymorphism has also been identified by NGS in the case of B. anthracis and Y. pestis. F. tularensis was detected in human abscess samples of unknown etiology by next generation direct DNA sequencing technique. NGS technologies have been extensively used in medical diagnostics, mainly for the identification of novel infectious biological agents for which diagnostics and therapeutics are currently unavailable (Cummings et al., 2010; Kuroda et al., 2012; Lefterova et al., 2015).",

However, a small group of vaccinated humans developed symptoms of arthritis when clinical investigation of the developed vaccine was in Phase II safety trials (Edelman et al., 2000). Live attenuated vaccines are preferred over other prophylactic countermeasures involving use of dead organisms as they offer a quick and long lasting immunogenic response even after single immunization. However, there is very high probability of natural reversion and dissemination reactogenicity of virulence characters loading to development of viral diseases or viremia. In contrast to this, chimeric vaccines have very light or no chance of producing viremia, as tested in animal models (Wang et al., 2008).",

In the present scenario, the existing decontamination systems are not so effective and specific, thus their efficiency is limited to an extent. Thus, the authors propose a strong need of development of more effective, specific, and eco-friendly decontamination technologies with key focus on selective and effective disinfection of biowarfare agents (Raber et al., 2001; Fitch et al., 2003; Weis et al., 2002).",

With the rapid evolution in synthetic biology techniques, the construction of synthetic biological agents and their further use as next generation bioweapons has been rapidly increasing, which eventually has enhanced the risk of biological warfare compared to the past. Many draft and whole genome sequences of important pathogenic bacteria and viruses infecting humans have been decoded to date and are accessible through nucleic acid sequence databases, such as Genbank, EMBL, DDBJ, GDB: The Human Genome DB, Microbial Genome DB for Comparative Analysis (MBGD), Virulence Factors of Bacterial Pathogens (VFDB), The National Microbial Pathogen DB Resource (NMPDR), Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR), Integrated DB for Viral Genomics (viruSITE), Barcode of Life Data Systems, CTD (Comparative Toxicogenomics DB), etc. So, there exists a virtual platform in the form of essential genes, virulence factors, or synthetic constructs with humanized infectious elements that provide huge scope to the bioweaponeers to develop next generation bioweapons based on designer genes or designer diseases models for instigating serious consequences in future bioterror attacks. A simple alteration in genetic compliment may make a pathogen more deadly than the existing natural forms. The emergence of next generation bioweapons including chimeric agents previously unknown to man can be even more dangerous and challenging than natural agents as they can cross all the barriers of pathogenicity. Also, due to current limitations in the methods of detection, protection, and decontamination, there exists a huge knowledge gap that needs attention for developing appropriate defensive strategies against biowarfare agents.",

Discontinuation of biowarfare programs can have a serious limitation on the nation\u2019s ability to develop appropriate defensive tools such as antibiotics, vaccines, and other therapeutics. Deployment of biowarfare programs in the military doctrine of a nation without endangering military alliances is always advantageous for national security and protecting the vulnerable civilian population. Additionally, domestic laws against use of bioweapons should be enacted. The Biological and Toxin Weapon Convention should be strengthened through a legal binding instrument. The authors highly recommend the use of physical protective and prophylactic measures to eliminate natural spread of existing contagious biowarfare agents at a mass scale, especially among the most vulnerable populations such as children with poor immunity and armed forces involved in direct combat at the war front.",
