Initial management involves lowering the blood pressure urgently especially in patients who have severe elevations of blood pressure that persists longer than 15 min. Once pulmonary edema occurs, parenteral therapy is more effective, and nitroglycerine is the agent of choice as recommended by The European Society of Cardiology [8]. Diuretics should be instituted to promote pre load reduction recognizing that the preeclamptic patient may have complex fluid balance needs due to low oncotic pressure. When necessary, noninvasive ventilation is recommended, in patients with increased work of breathing or hypoxemia as it is known to improve these parameters and can decrease the need for invasive mechanical ventilation by [9].",

Certain factors easily obtained by a good history can help you understand who is at increased risk of complications from asthma, these being history of exacerbations, intubations, and recent steroid use. Most exacerbations are characterized by cough, wheezing, and dyspnea. The National Asthma Education and Prevention (NAEP) group recommends obtaining a baseline peak expiratory flow in order to guide further management. If the patient is approaching less than half of what their baseline is, then treatment with supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxemia and bronchodilators such as a beta-agonist and anticholinergic agents are to be given. A target oxygen saturation above 90 % with consideration for invasive mechanical ventilation in those who are in impending respiratory failure. A partial pressure of carbon dioxide within the normal range of 36\u201340 on an arterial blood gas can be a early sign of imment respiratory failure in the gravid patient. Intravenous steroids also have to be instituted. Care should be taken during mechanical ventilation to avoid a short expiratory time that can cause auto peep [16]. Intravenous magnesium sulfate may be beneficial in acute severe asthma in addition to bronchodilators especially in patients with coexistent hypertension or preterm uterine contractions [16, 17].",
