[1] [2] Although patients with this infection may have mild-to-moderate disease with clinical recovery, some may develop severe respiratory failure with or without cardiovascular collapse. [3] [4] The high risks of infection have mandated rigorous infectious precautions and adjusted workflows for patient care, including airway management, echocardiography, cardiothoracic and vascular procedures as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The purpose of this freestanding editorial is to highlight the considerations in ECMO for critically ill patients with this important disease. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization has recently released a guideline to outline strategies for this mechanical therapy in this setting. 5 This clinical focus will include best practices to disseminate the highest standards for care of both our patients and ourselves during this crisis. The provided references can also serve as a guide for healthcare teams as they manage the demands of the pandemic at their respective institutions.",

[12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 3 Furthermore, an additional key consideration is that ECMO is a rescue strategy for severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. 5 The initial management priorities in this challenging scenario include treating the underlying cause, securing the airway, optimizing protective lowstretch lung ventilation, as well as judicious fluid therapy and titrated diuresis. 5;14 In the setting of these management approaches, oxygenation may still deteriorate as measured by decreases in the blood oxygen tension/inspired oxygen ratio. [14] [15] When this ration falls below 150 mmHg, further recommended interventions include recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, titration of positive end-expiratory pressure, and inhaled pulmonary vasodilators such as nitric oxide and epoprostenol. 5 If this ratio falls below 80 mmHg for 6 hours, or below 50 mmHg for 3 hours, then ECMO should be considered in the absence of institution-specific contraindications. 12-14 A third recognized indication for ECMO in this setting has also been based on a deteriorating arterial blood gas, namely a pH below 7.25 with a blood carbon dioxide tension greater than 60 mmHg for at least 6 hours. 5 Although ECMO is the primary strategy for management of refractory hypercarbia in this clinical setting, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal may have a role in highly selected patients. [16] [17] The contraindications for ECMO in patients with coronavirus virus infection must be hospital-specific, taking into account factors such as experience with ECMO and availability of resources in real-time during the pandemic. [12] [13] [14] Furthermore, patient comorbidities such as advanced age, frailty, chronic lung disease, diabetes, heart failure, and prolonged mechanical ventilation significantly increase mortality risk in severe coronavirus infection and may consequently be contraindications to ECMO. [14] [15] [16] The indications and contraindications to ECMO during the coronavirus crisis should be adjusted in real-time to local factors. 4 ",
