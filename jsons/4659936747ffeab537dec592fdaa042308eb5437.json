After 48 hours at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfukell, a sixfold increase in MHC class I expression was induced from initially low levels of expression. In contrast, MHC class II was induced de novo to five times the control fluorescence level. At least 70% of the cells were infected as determined using fluorescence microscopy and anti-WNV antibody labeling. Myoblasts were >90% pure as shown by anti-Leu-19 labeling. MHC class I (but not class II) was increased threefold after exposure to virus-inactivated supernatant from 48-hour-infected cells, indicating the presence of factor(s) contributing to the MHC class I increase. These findings may be important in establishing a link between viral infection of human cells and induction of inflammatory autoimmune disease.

Infection was detectable in at least 70% of myoblasts in all experiments as a bright specific perinuclear fluorescence (Fig. 4A ) compared with uninfected controls (Fig. 4B) . DISCUSSION We report here that infection of human myoblasts by WNV significantly upregulates MHC class I and induces de novo class I1 expression. This was shown to be due, at least in part, to virusinduced secreted but unidentified soluble fact o r~, '~,~' since the virus-inactivated supernatants from WNV-infected myoblast cultures were able to induce increased MHC class I expression in fresh myoblast cultures. This may also be due to a direct virus effect.26 In contrast, MHC class I1 on myoblasts may be induced by the virus directly, as there was no induction of MHC class I1 in response to the virus-inactivated supernatant. The mechanism of this apparent direct induction by the active WNV is presently unknown. We think it may relate to the way some protein product(s) of viral transcription interact with the host cell. Investigation into possible mechanisms is presently being undertaken. Interestingly, and by contrast, UV-inactivated nonreplicating neurotropic coronavirus particles appear to be able to induce class 11 MHC in a small subpopulation of astrocytes in ~i t r o .~' This suggests different mechanisms of induction of class I1 by these two viruses and, if true, would clearly have different implications for the respective antiviral immune responses.",
