Bronchiolitis is also associated with influenza and parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, rhinoviruses, and enteroviruses (Bosis et al., 2005, Coiras et al., 2003, Legg et al., 2005). Although human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) have been identified and associated with a significant proportion of bronchiolitis over the last 3 years, no pathogen is recovered in a substantial proportion of cases (Bastien et al., 2005, Chiu et al., 2005, Esper et al., 2005, Principi et al., 2004, Principi et al., 2006).",

He had been spontaneously delivered after a premature membrane rupture at the gestational age of 33 weeks (birth weight 2670 g; Apgar score 9 at 1 min). At birth, he was asymptomatic and no respiratory support was required. He was hospitalised for 7 days before being sent home. He was mixed-fed from birth, and showed adequate growth. He had never left Italy, and none of his contacts had travelled abroad in the previous 6 months. The child's father had experienced an uncomplicated febrile upper respiratory tract infection starting the day before the child was admitted. Bronchiolitis was diagnosed on the basis of the findings of rhinorrhea, tachypnea, chest retractions, wheezing and bibasilar rales. Chest radiography showed hyperinflated lungs and an increased anteroposterior diameter in lateral view without any parenchymal abnormalities. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was tested for adenovirus, influenza virus types A and B, RSV types A and B, parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus 229E human coronavirus OC43, human coranovirus NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 by real-time amplification assays at the Department of Virology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (Bosis et al., 2005, Fouchier et al., 2004, Heim et al., 2003, Kares et al., 2004, Maertzdorf et al., 2004, van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005a). Total nucleic acids were isolated using a MagnaPureLC Isolation Station (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany), and a universal internal control virus to monitor the process from isolation of the nucleic acids until their real-time detection (Niesters, 2002). The RNA was amplified in a single-tube, two-step reaction using Taqman reverse transcription reagents and a PCR core reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands) in an ABI 7700 or ABI 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). A cultured virus was used as a positive control for each assay except in the case of HCoV-HKU1, for which a cloned construct was synthesised from published sequences of part of the nucleoprotein gene (Woo et al., 2005a). On the basis of proficiency testing data (Templeton et al., 2006), the estimated sensitivity of each assay was less than 500\u20131000 copies/mL.",

As only a few patients with HCoV-HKU1 infection have been described so far, it is impossible to define the real importance of the virus. The fact that the majority of the reported cases (including ours) experienced a lower respiratory infection requiring hospitalisation suggests that its clinical impact may be significant. Previous studies have demonstrated that children aged less than 2 years are most at risk of HCoV-HKU1 infection, which significantly contributes to the microbial burden of patients with respiratory and enteric diseases during the colder months (Esper et al., 2006, Lau et al., 2006, Sloots et al., 2006, Vabret et al., 2006). HCoV-HKU1 can also be present as a persistent asymptomatic infection in patients with underlying conditions (Lau et al., 2006, Vabret et al., 2006). However, further epidemiological and clinical investigations are needed to precisely define the role of HCoV-HKU1 in respiratory infections.",
