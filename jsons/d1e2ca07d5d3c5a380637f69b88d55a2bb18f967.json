Number of X-rays, their indications and calculated dose of radiation were documented. Their mean birth weight (+SD) and gestational age (+SD) were 1077 (\u00b1219.8) g and 29.7 (+2.57) wk respectively. Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates underwent significantly higher radiographs when compared with VLBW neonates; 7.5(5-13.25) vs. 2(1-6); p < 0.0001. ELBW neonates received 3 times higher dose of radiation, when compared with VLBW neonates; 139.4 \u03bcsv (81.6-256.15) vs. 46.6 \u03bcsv (14.4-115.7); p < 0.0001. Seven percent of ELBW neonates received >1msv radiation. Lifetime risk associated with high radiation exposure during neonatal period is unknown. Every effort should be taken to reduce number of radiographs. Imaging modalities without radiation exposure such as, point of care ultrasound should be used wherever possible.",

As the quality of neonatal care is improving, more and more sick premature babies with complex medical conditions are now surviving.

Prospective data was collected on various radiologic examinations performed for different indications during the study period. Standard Radiographic settings were used for different radiographic procedures. Conventional radiography with digital image plate was used. For Chest Radiograph, tube voltage of 65 KV, current of 0.6 mA and film to tube distance of 90 cms was used. For abdominal examination, voltage 65-70 KV and 0.6 mA current and for infantogram 50 KV voltage and 0.5 mA current was used. Entrance skin dose (ESD) measurement for each patient during each radiographic procedure was technically and organizationally impractical, so standard reference dose of radiation in microsievert (\u03bcsv) for each radiologic examination under NICU conditions was taken from reference ranges published by Puch-Kapst and colleagues, and for CT examinations from Huda and Vance [2, 3] . Standard reference dose used were for Babygram 23.8 microSv, Chest X-ray 14.4 microSv and for Abdominal X-ray/ umbilical venous catheter (UVC)/ umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) 17.8 microSv [2] . Effective dose of radiation exposure for a baby was calculated by adding doses from multiple examinations [1] .",

Similar observations of high cumulative dose of radiation exposure was made by Lau et al. and Sutton et al. [5, 6] . Premature infants are often too small to easily target one area of the body without obscuring critical areas of interest. As a result they may receive a higher effective radiation dose than adults, and highly vulnerable tissues (thyroid, gonads and brain) are often included [2, 7] . There are reports of dosedependent increase in the risk of leukemia and brain tumors in children exposed to CT scans during childhood [8] .",
