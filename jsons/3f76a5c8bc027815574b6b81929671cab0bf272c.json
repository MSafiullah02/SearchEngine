In this study, we characterized the susceptibility of A. diaperinus populations from broiler farms of southern Brazil to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos. Larvae and adults of A. diaperinus were exposed to these technical insecticides diluted in acetone in residual bioassays. A geographic variation in the susceptibility of larvae and adults of A. diaperinus to both insecticides was detected. The larval LC 50 for cypermethrin ranged from 0.43 to 7.33 \u00b5g a.i./cm 2 . Two populations from Santa Catarina state presented higher resistance ratios of 13.6-and 17-fold. When adults were exposed to cypermethrin, the LC 50 ranged from 0.46 to 4.93 \u00b5g a.i./cm 2 , with population SC-3 from Santa Catarina having lower susceptibility (resistance ratio of 10.7-fold). When exposed to chlorpyrifos, A. diaperinus larvae present LC 50 values ranging from 0.21 to 4.30 \u00b5g a.i./cm 2 . Larvae from Paran\u00e1 and Santa Catarina (SC-1 population) presented the highest resistance ratios, ranging from 10-to 20-fold. In adults, the LC 50 of chlorpyrifos ranged from 0.17 to 5.30 \u00b5g a.i./cm 2 , showing a maximum resistance ratio of 31-fold in a population from Paran\u00e1 state. Based on LC 99 values, candidate diagnostic concentrations of 15 and 12 \u00b5g a.i./cm 2 of cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos, respectively, were also estimated for the resistance monitoring of A. diaperinus in Brazil.

In an attempt to reduce population densities, poultry bedding removal and a period of poultry absence are recommended (Hamm et al. 2006) . Another control tactic is to cover the poultry bedding with tarpaulin to promote fermentation, thus raising the temperature above levels critical to beetle survival (Salin et al. 1998 ). These methods have limited efficacy, since they do not reach all insects present, due to some insects surviving in galleries in the farm structure, favoring new infestations. Alternative control strategies, such as biopesticides and entomopathogenic fungi have some efficacy against A. diaperinus but are rarely used in broiler farms (Chernaki-Leffer et al. 2007 , Rezende et al. 2009 , Szczepanik et al. 2016 . Though some of these management strategies reduce the infestation of this species, the use of insecticides remains the main control strategy (Oliveira et al. 2016) . Currently, the insecticides registered for application in poultry facilities in Brazil include pyrethroids and organophosphates that contain the active ingredients cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos, respectively. These insecticides are widely used, isolated or in mixture, in commercial formulated products against A. diaperinus (Silva et al. 2007 , Oliveira et al. 2016 .

In other words, the relative high resistance ratio to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos in some A. diaperinus populations from Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1 seems a probable response of high exposure to selection pressure.

Cypermethrin is a sodium channel modulator that causes excitatory paralysis of the insect, whereas chlorpyrifos is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (Insecticide Resistance Action Committee [IRAC] 2017). Both active ingredients are widely used against A. diaperinus in broiler farms in Brazil and other countries (Steelman 2008 , Tomberlin et al. 2008 , Chernaki-Leffer et al. 2011 , Oliveira et al. 2016 . Specifically, in Brazil, the reduced number of active ingredients registered for use in broiler farms has contributed to the resistance evolution in A. diaperinus. Thus, insecticides from other chemical groups should be considered against this pest, such as spinosad and imidacloprid, which mimic the agonistic action of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Additionally, chlorfenapyr, which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation through the disruption of the proton gradient and interferes with metabolic processes and energy production in mitochondria (IRAC 2017) . Spinosad, imidacloprid, and chlorfenapyr are not registered for use in broiler farms in Brazil, but they showed high efficacy against A. diaperinus in Australia and the United States (Lambkin and Rice 2007, Singh and Johnson 2015) . Spinosad also increased the mortality of resistant beetles to cyfluthrin and fenitrothion, due to the absence of cross-resistance among these insecticides (Lambkin and Furlong 2014) .
