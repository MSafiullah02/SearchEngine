Human nature is to err in favor of intervention rather than thoughtful inaction, commission over omission. As a result, we have seen widespread adoption of a variety of (primarily pharmacologic) interventions with little or no supportive evidence. The temptation of bioplausibility has again emerged in critical care medicine (CCM), despite a negative track record of results for pharmacologic therapies in multicenter trials (1) . Given limitations in resources as well as evidence, we need to tread lightly in the intensive care unit more than ever.",

These concepts seemingly are at odds with one another. Zen philosophy emphasizes mindful speech, reflection, and action. Intensive care conjures images of invasiveness and aggressive care. In combination, the #zentensivist approach focuses on minimally burdensome ICU care that is grounded in pragmatism, humanism, and tolerance of risk in facing the abnormal and unknown. Here we describe how this perspective can best be applied to the care of the critically-ill COVID-19 patient.",

In this scenario, the awake patient can participate in many aspects of their care and bond with the care team(5), without experiencing potentially deleterious effects of IMV and sedation.

Even past positive single-center trials have been near impossible to show benefit once replicated in multicenter RCTs (7) .

Understandably, many of us feel compelled to act, which introduces temptation to broadly apply unproven interventions. In the short term, the answer is not to be found in off-label therapies or unvalidated biomarkers. The zentensivist mindfully attends to the core group of interventions with proven impact on patient outcomes, for instance, lungprotective ventilation, conservative fluid management, and the ABCDEF bundle (8) . While additional data is gathered on this admittedly novel condition, we must concentrate on timetested tools to liberate patients from the burdens of our environment.",

From all angles, the pressure to add interventions to change the course of illness is heaped upon the bedside clinician. This inertia unfortunately puts us and our patients at high risk for future medical reversal(9), whereby current practices will be shown to be ineffective or even harmful by future studies. The stress of the pandemic requires us to practice \"clinical mindfulness\", a tenet of zentensivism that emphasizes learning from our past experiences, understanding the limitations of medical science as well as our therapeutic options. The key message of the #zentensivist to those on the front lines against COVID-19 is not novel: less is more. Less is likely to work for more patients, however more may be needed in fewer patients who have the reserve to survive extraordinary intensive care support and to thrive once they survive their critical illness. If we devote our efforts to humanistic, minimally invasive care that is focused on core interventions, we can create an environment that facilitates ICU liberation and recovery.",
