This has the potential to indirectly threaten the lives and livelihoods of more than 22 million people in Ebola-affected areas (ACAPS 2014). The epidemic may also have a long-term socio-economic and political implications on the affected country\u2019s development trajectory (Piot 2014). The first episode of the disease was first recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976. The most recent outbreak occurred in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. The origin of EVD (the primary infectious event) is yet to be known in spite of various studies that have been carried out on the epidemic. According to Nadia, (2015) an index case was identified four times and hypothesized in two other instances among the twenty-one documented outbreaks of EVD in Africa. For instance, as at 2016, there were estimated 28,639 suspected, likely, and established cases of EVD and a projected 11,316 deaths from the 2014 epidemic of EVD in West Africa (CDC 2016). More so, there were 2427 reported cases and 1597 deaths in all other outbreaks of Ebola (CDC 2016). The Ebola outbreak began slowly in Sierra Leone and quickly degenerated to an epidemic between May and June, 2014. An ex-post examination indicated that the first case recorded in Sierra Leone was a woman who was a guest at the home of the index case in Meliandou, Guinea (WHO 2015).",

According to a World Bank 2014 projection, \u201can estimated $2.2 billion was lost in 2015 in the gross domestic product (GDP) of the three countries. The disease also resulted in lower investment and a substantial loss in private sector growth, declining agricultural production that led to concerns about food security, and a decrease in cross-border trade as restrictions on movement of goods and services increased\u201d (CDC 2016). Sierra Leone recorded the highest number of cases with 14,124 suspected and confirmed cases and a total of 3956 confirmed deaths among all the three most affected West African countries, (CDC 2016). It equally recorded a total government budget (deficit of about 3.10% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product GDP) in 2015. Government budget in Sierra Leone averaged \u22124.46% of GDP from 1999 until 2015, reaching an all-time height of \u22120.98% of GDP in 2007 and a record low of about \u22129.47% of GDP in 1999 (World Bank 2016).",

For example, Hakon et al. (2014) \u201cnoted that Ebola has strong and devastating effects on the health of the population and submitted that in addition to the direct health effects of the viral disease, the indirect effects on health service may lead to increased morbidity and mortality\u201d. More so, factors such as patient\u2019s fear of Ebola and death of health care staff has reportedly affected health-seeking behaviour and reduced the function of health service. Despite many studies on the Ebola-welfare transmission mechanism, decreasing government revenue resulting from the closure of most mining and food companies of the affected countries, makes investigation of the impact of the Ebola disease on the government expenditures of the affected country vital. This is because decreasing government revenue may impact negatively on the growth of the economy. This study therefore investigates the effect of Ebola outbreak on government capital expenditure of the Sierra Leonean government. The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: Sect. 6.2 reviews empirical literature on the effects of disease outbreak on government expenditures, Sect. 6.3 presents stylized facts on the effects of Ebola crisis on the Sierra Leone economy; Sect. 6.4 described the theory and method of analysis Sect. 6.5 while Sect. 6.6 presents the empirical results and discussion of results.",

There are many problems facing the health sector in Sierra Leone before the outbreak of Ebola. According to \u201cThe Agenda for Prosperity\u2019 Sierra Leone health sector suffers from inadequate health infrastructure, shortage of skilled personnel, insufficient prevalence of trained doctors and nurses and weak supervision in the health system and high burden of disease. According to WHO (2010), Sierra Leone had only 132 community health workers as at 2010 and there are more Sierra Leonean doctors working in OECD countries. Which makes Sierra Leone be one of the African countries bedevilled with brain drain in the health sector. Curtis, (2015) observed that the challenges in the Sierra Leonean health sector, as outlined in the Agenda for Prosperity, include: poor health infrastructure, inadequate health care financing resulting in catastrophic health spending. Also included in this Agenda is low coverage in the provision of water and sanitation, high burden of communicable diseases and increasing non-communicable diseases, shortage of healthcare workers and weak human resource as well as poor health sector management.",

It was further pointed out that the effectiveness of health measures does not only rely on financial resources (i.e. public and private spending) but also on the political support or goals of the government (Cassels 1995; Hsiao and Heller 2007) and the efficient use of existing resources (institutional quality & good governance) (Walt and Gilson 1994; Evans et al. 2001; Ghobarah et al. 2004; Gauri and Lieberman 2006; McGuire 2006; Gilson and Raphaely 2008).",

Also, differences in public spending patterns which can be observed between low- middle- and high-income countries may be related more to dissimilarities in health challenges as well as institutional designs of the health sector (Gerdtham et al. 1992). One major distinction between low-and high-income countries regarding health challenges, is that, while individuals in high-income countries suffer mostly from non-communicable diseases (e.g. stroke, cancer, heart attack), health systems in developing countries are used to finance the burden of communicable and infectious diseases such as Ebola and tuberculosis (Hsiao and Heller 2007).",

(2016) found that the South Korean government was forced to cut the country\u2019s economic growth forecast for 2015 to 3.1%, a drop from the projected 3.8% in 2014. This was due to the government\u2019s inability to effectively control MERS. Consequently, and compared to the previous year, retail shops in South Korea faced a 3.4% decrease in sales, and department stores also experienced a 16.5% decrease in sales. The authors further asserted that the outbreak led to over 100,000 cancelled tourist visits to South Korea. As a result, a stimulus package of over $13.5 billion and a 0.25-percentage-point cut in interest rates was offered by the government to reduce the adverse economic effects of the outbreak. This stimulus package was a re-direction of government spending from productive sector to reduce the effects of the epidemic.",

Piot, (2014) observed that healthcare workers were principally vulnerable to contracting the disease. This led to an increase in non-Ebola related mortality (ACAPS 2014; Piot 2014). Also, about 80% HIV/AIDS positive individuals living in the three most affected countries were unable to access treatment and pregnantwomen stopped giving birth in health facilities (ACAPS 2014; Glassman and Raghavan 2014). Muiderman, (2014) affirmed that the Ebola crisis had a significant negative impact on the economies of the countries it has affected and its impact can be felt in different sectors.

Ten out of the 124 medical doctors in the country died due to Ebola, equivalent to a risk ratio of 280 compared to the general population (Hakon et al. 2014). Many health centres and hospitals in the country were closed down due to the death or desertion of member of staff (Welthungerhilfe 2014; Glassman and Raghavan 2014). Health and burial workers also went on strike over hazard payment and in some cases no payment (ACAPS 2014). Thus, there was a general reversal of the gains made in the health sector in relation to child mortality, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases as a result of the closure of health services and the diversion of resources to combatting Ebola (Glassman and Raghavan 2014). The EVD epidemic also had a devastating socio-economic impact in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone beside the adverse health effects. The disease resulted in low investment and a large loss in private sector growth and declining agricultural production, and a decrease in cross-border trade due to increased restrictions on movement of goods and services. The school children lost a total of 39 productive week in Sierra Leone and children experienced a gap in vaccination schedules due to a decrease in routine immunizations by 30% (CDC 2016).",

The crisis culminated in increasing unemployment among the youth (GoSL et al. 2014). The government and donors agencies also diverted fund for different sectors to combat Ebola. This created a funding gap for non-Ebola related government services (Brigitte 2014). The emphasis on health versus social spending varies among the three countries. In Sierra Leone, EVD-related spending for 2014 and 2015 were about $36 million and $40.9 million respectively (IMF 2014a). In Liberia the authorities estimated direct EVD spending at $79.7 million, besides $20 million in cash transfers and $30 million in agricultural stimulus (Government of Liberia 2014).

The IMF (2014a) estimated the balance of payments shifting from a programmed surplus of $38 million before the crisis to a deficit of $72.4 million in 2014. The currency depreciated relative to international currencies. Other studies indicated the revenue implications of EVD on Sierra Leone and have identified transmission channels. The preliminary country estimates shows that due to the EVD, the country experienced a 14.9% decline in revenue by the end of 2014 (National Revenue Authority of Sierra Leone 2014). The EVD-related revenue loss was around $45.7 million in 2014 and $91.3 million in 2015, or 1% and 1.6% of non-iron GDP In monetary terms (IMF 2014a). The negative effects of EVD in Sierra Leone include mortality of key health personnel, stretched health infrastructure and reversal of health gains as non-EVD health delivery was compromised. The education sector suffered due to school closures. Many students were forced to study via online platforms or through radio programs. Hence, EVD is a threat to social structure among vulnerable groups such as women and children. About 51% of women and 49% of men were infected including more women in agriculture and trade than men (Government of Sierra Leone 2014).",

This then results in greater morbidity and mortality of the ailment. Such costs borne by the burden of disease includes: both private and public expenditures incurred in managing the disease. All these costs are incurred or increased by the pressing need to sustain a free environment, implement better preventive measures and carry out research that can help curb the disease. (Commission on Macroeconomics and Health 2002). The immediate effect of epidemics is a negative shock on the population and labour force. Lee and McKibbin, (2004) argued the destruction of human capital is another transmission mechanism through which disease outbreak adversely affects the economy\u2019s long-term growth. However, in term of private costs and public spending, the direct consequences of the Ebola epidemic are high and have detrimental effects on productive sectors. Ebola influences the Sierra Leone economy in major three ways. First, fear of Ebola leads to a considerable decline in consumer demand, especially for travel since the fast rate of contagion makes people avoid social interactions. The decrease in consumption has a more detrimental effect on regions with more service industries and higher population densities and this negatively affects not only the revenue generation capacity of the government but also compel an inevitable diversion of public expenditure from productive industry and human capital development to Ebola epidemic. Second, uncertainty concerning any future epidemics reduces confidence in the future and this effect is very important for a developing country like Sierra Leone which required foreign investment for growth and development. Third, Ebola unquestionably increases the cost of disease prevention, especially in the most affected industries, such as travel, retail and the service industries.",

The implication is that government can influence long-run economics growth through its investment expenditure, education (human capital) and research and development (R&D) expenditure. But given an outbreak of a deadly communicable disease, all these expenditures may be absent. The exposition of work on endogenous growth has generated a number of models linking public spending with economic growth. A particular simple version is Barro\u2019s (1990), which takes government expenditure to be complementary with production. This framework assumes that all components of public expenditure are productive. This study considers a modification of simple model of endogenous growth assuming that the government imposes a proportional income tax rate and instead of using the public budget to furnish both households with public consumption and firms with productive investments, uses public budget to contain disease outbreak.",

The result shows that GCE was stationary at levels for model 1 and model 3 and non-stationary at model 2 while it was stationary at the first difference in the three models. Also, EVD was stationary at levels for both models 1 and models 2 and also at first difference for the three models.

Table 6.4 further shows the long-run relationship between GCE and EVD. The equilibrium adjustment coefficient (\u22120.8044) shows the correct sign (negative). This suggests that GCE and EVD converge to long-run equilibrium and deviations from this equilibrium relationship as a result of shocks will be corrected over time. It can also be observed that \u03b12 tends to one, indicating that the speed of adjustment to equilibrium is fast. It follows that about 80% of the deviation from equilibrium path is corrected per annum. The ECM results therefore show a long-run relationship between GCE and EVD.\n",

More so, much of the foreign assistance to the country will also be targeted at attacking the epidemic rather than economic growth and development. These will conspicuously have a dampening effect on growth in Sierra Leone. Therefore, EVD or outbreak of any communicable disease will affect government capital expenditure negatively and by implication dampen the economic growth of any affected country. Also, population growth and life expectancy are directly related to government capital expenditure. This also implies that both can aid growth of the economy with an increase in capital expenditure. Both results are also significant at 1% level. Net migration, health expenditure per capita and GDP are also positively related to government capital expenditure but not significant. The non-significance of net migration, health expenditure per capita and GDP may be as a result of the outbreak of the disease during this period.\n",

As highlighted earlier, the disease did not only infected and killed people in this country, but had the greater impact of affecting the economic situation of the country leading to a deficit in government budget of about 3.1%. This study examined the impact of EVD on government capital expenditure in Sierra Leone. This is important for the implication of disease outbreak on economic growth. The study shows that EVD impacted negatively on government capital expenditure, hence economic growth. EVD impacted negatively on growth due to diversion of government spending on curtailing the spread of the disease, treating the affected individuals and caring for the orphans and widows who lost their parents and husbands due to the outbreak of the disease. Equally, the restriction of movement of people to and from affected zones also led to many more people not being able to work and thus leading to a decline in productivity and growth. Minimizing the impact of communicable diseases vs reducing their occurrence is to prioritize investment in human capital development through e.g. education for all, water and sanitation for all, settings approaches (healthy cities, Health promoting schools, health promoting hospitals, health promoting working places and markets), etc. Emergency funds also needs to be created to spend on possible future occurrence of this nature, so as to prevent spending funds meant for growth on containing outbreak of diseases. Finally, since economic growth and development are the main objectives of public expenditure, issues of growth policy should emphasize quality and adequate levels of investment in social and economic infrastructure.",
