For the current review, we reassessed all papers derived from our previous searches (last performed on December 28, 2015 (13)) and conducted an online update on April 18, 2017. Following the previous search strategies, papers were searched on PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland), MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), and Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) for the following combination of keywords: 1) \u201cinfluenza\u201d or \u201cflu\u201d; 2) \u201cvaccine effectiveness\u201d or \u201cVE\u201d; 3) \u201ctest-negative\u201d or \u201ctest negative\u201d or \u201ccase-control\u201d or \u201ccase control\u201d; and 4) sets 1, 2, and 3. Articles were independently screened by 2 of the authors (S.F. and S.G.S.). Studies estimating influenza VE for any season, any influenza type/subtype, or any type of influenza vaccination by VE were considered. Only articles published in English were considered. Studies or subanalyses of studies which reanalyzed previously published data, reported interim estimates, or did not use the TND were excluded. All studies meeting these inclusion criteria were further screened and were included if influenza VE was estimated using alternative control groups, including FLU-negative, ORV-positive, and/or PAN-negative controls.",

We evaluated whether pooled \u0394VEFLU\u2212,ORV+ differed from zero among children or young adults more than among elderly adults. To further examine whether any study design feature was associated with VE estimates, we also conducted meta-regression by means of univariate and multivariate random-effects models. The predictors included age group (children, adults, elderly, and all ages), study setting (inpatient/outpatient/mixed), season (single/multiple), restriction of patients to those presenting for health care within 4 days (yes/no), exclusive use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/reverse transcription PCR for testing (yes/no), number of ORVs tested, and type of control group (FLU-negative, ORV-positive, or PAN-negative).

(32) reported results by age group, we were able to calculate estimates for a total of 18 triplets from 12 studies (Table 2). The vaccination coverage estimated from the FLU-negative group ranged from 9.0% among inpatient children aged 6 months\u201317 years in Hong Kong, China, in 2009\u20132013 (25) to 68.3% among outpatient children aged 6 months\u20135 years in Australia in 2008 (27). The differences in vaccination coverage between the ORV-positive and PAN-negative groups ranged from \u221228.4% to 16.0% (Table 2). However, the paired t test comparing mean vaccination coverage between these groups suggested no statistical difference (P = 0.61). Of 18 differences in vaccination coverage point estimates, 6 were higher than 10%. We did not identify any age- or setting-specific pattern larger or smaller than 10% by univariate analysis.",

However, we only observed a nonsignificant, weak, negative correlation between the number of ORVs tested and the proportion PAN-negative. The types of viruses included in the panel may also affect the proportion PAN-negative. For example, in the 2 studies reporting the detection rates of each ORV, rhinovirus and RSV were most commonly detected. Only 1 study from Hong Kong (25) did not include rhinovirus, which could explain why this study had the highest proportion PAN-negative. The differences in proportion PAN-negative are likely to also be associated with viral load and shedding. With the exception of the Hong Kong study (25), the studies involving children presented low proportions of PAN-negative subjects among all eligible subjects, which is consistent with observations of higher viral load and shedding from children (37). The heterogeneity of viral shedding by age suggests potential misclassification bias in the PAN-negative group, where results may be more likely to be false-negative among samples taken from older patients. Other reasons for false-negative influenza results may be associated with suboptimal swab quality, imperfect laboratory testing methods, or long intervals from symptom onset to presentation (11). All of these factors could contribute to misclassification of infection status and contribute to larger \u0394VEORV+,PAN\u2212 values. Under this circumstance, the ORV-positive group could be considered the one providing more accurate VE estimates, because it demonstrates that the swab and swabbing method were of sufficient quality to detect virus (28).",

Using FLU-negative controls is likely to produce VE estimates that are as reliable as those of ORV-positive and PAN-negative controls. From a resource-saving perspective, investigators in surveillance systems or research schemes using the TND to measure influenza VE may consider not testing further for ORVs when estimating influenza VE. Further simulation studies that incorporate multiple sources of bias and examine this phenomenon in different age groups could help confirm or refute our findings.",
