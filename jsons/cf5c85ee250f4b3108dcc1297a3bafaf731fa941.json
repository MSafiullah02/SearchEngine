The main goal of this research is to develop an Ordinance-Tweet Mining App that disseminates the results of analyzing ordinances and tweets about them, especially related to Smart City Characteristics such as Smart Environment, Smart Mobility etc. This app would be beneficial to various users such as environmental scientists, policy makers, city committees as well as the common public in becoming more aware of legislative bodies, and possibly contributing in different aspects to make the urban area improve as a Smart City. This work fits the realm of Smart Governance due to transparency via public involvement.",

It is thus important to disseminate knowledge on urban policy to the public. Ordinances (local laws) are often publicly available, e.g. [3] , yet many residents view them as impervious due to complex legalese. Thus, ordinances need mining to discover knowledge that a wide spectrum of users can comprehend. A related aspect is public opinion on social media. It is important to gauge public reactions on issues related to ordinances by opinion mining. The results of mining ordinances and their public reactions need dissemination to be easily accessible and understandable. This is the focus of our overall research [4, 5] .",

Based on this, we develop an Ordinance-Tweet Mining App, to disseminate the analysis. In this paper, we describe the app development using principles from HCI (Human Computer Interaction), e.g. [8, 9] . We explain the mining of ordinances and tweets leading to useful legislative information disseminated by the app. This app provides QA (Question Answering) on interesting issues in urban policy. It is user-friendly, including interactive graphs and FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) that facilitate comprehension by the public and experts. Targeted users, including the common public and domain experts in environmental management evaluate this app. In this paper, we focus on disseminating the results of mining NYC ordinances available on its public legislative council website [3] . We collect tweets from NYC through location-based data available on Twitter. We consider NYC since it is the financial capital of the USA, one of the major metropolitan cities in the world and a leading Smart City (see Fig. 1 ) [3, 10] . As per world rankings, NYC is among the top 25 smart cities worldwide [11] . This is a good achievement. Yet there is scope for enhancement. We address this in the mining of ordinances and tweets, and in the corresponding app.",

            "text": "In our earlier works, we propose methods for mining of ordinances from websites [4, 12] and furthermore, the mining of public opinions about them expressed on Twitter [5, 13, 14] . We use these methods for ordinance-tweet mining within NYC and conduct evaluation as included in our papers [4, 5, [12] [13] [14] . As stated in [5, pp. 1721-1722] , \"an important focus in our work is to determine to what extent such ordinances contribute to establishing the relevant urban region as a Smart City. Hence, we categorize ordinances based on their pertinent Smart City Characteristics (SCCs). We aim to connect ordinances to relevant tweets by drawing on their semantic relatedness. This is nontrivial, as ordinances and tweets both involve highly intricate and rather heterogeneous natural language, so simple keyword matching does not suffice. We propose a two-step approach for mapping that exploits the transitive nature of the connection between ordinances and tweets considering their relationship with SCCs. Specifically, the transitive property we invoke is that: if the ordinance relates to a given SCC and any tweet relates to the same SCC, then the ordinance bears a connection to the tweet. This approach is proposed because classical sources of SCC data e.g., [1, 2] are finite and are restricted to a limited set of identifying features that can be relied upon for mapping. Thus, this transitive approach is more feasible than attempting to directly relate a seemingly infinite number of tweets to ordinances from various websites. As a first step, we discover connections between SCCs and ordinances using classical SCC sources [2] guided by commonsense knowledge (CSK) from web-based repositories [15, 16] . In the second step, we consider the mapping of tweets to SCCs, again drawing on such CSK. This approach then enables us to directly relate ordinances and the tweets to the pertinent aspects of Smart Cities and also sets the stage for sentiment polarity classification\" [5, pp. 1721-1722] . Based on this, our mapping algorithm is Algorithm 1, as presented herewith [5] .",

This is conducted after the mapping of ordinances to tweets. The primary database used for Sentiment Analysis in this work is SentiWordNet [17] . This is an enhanced version of the CSK source WordNet [15] . It groups words into synonym sets (synsets) annotated by how positive the terms are. Accordingly, words are classified as positive, negative or neutral based on polarity of terms. In SentiWordNet, different meanings exhibited by the same word can have different sentiment scores. For example, the word estimable when relating to computation has a neutral score of 0.0, while the same word in the sense of deserving respect is assigned a positive score of 0.75. The process we deploy for sentiment analysis of tweets constitutes a semi-supervised learning method using SentiWordNet. Through this, subtle human judgment through commonsense in understanding emotions is embodied in the mining processes with specific reference to context\" [13, pp. 841-842] . Accordingly, our algorithm for polarity classification of tweets is Algorithm 2 as presented next [13] .",

We construct SCC-based Domain KBs (Domain-Specific Knowledge Bases) [5, 13, 14] derived from WebChild [16] and WordNet [15] , to filter out unwanted tweets as a first step, followed by the mapping of tweets to relevant ordinances using SCCs as a next step\" [13, pp. 841-842] . We start mapping groups of ordinances to tweets [5, 13] , and then connect them with each other at finer levels of granularity [14] by mapping individual ordinances to tweets. This is via ordinance KBs in addition to SCC KBs, incorporating pragmatics and semantics through CSK and domain knowledge respectively [14] . The mining in our work is on ordinances and tweets from NYC, using a public council site [3] and Twitter location-based data. The results of the SCCbased ordinance analysis and tweet polarity classification comprise significant inputs for building the Ordinance-Tweet Mining App. We now describe its design process.",

An important concept in HCI is Fitt's Law [9, pp. 518-519], i.e., \"T = k log 2 (D/S + 1.0) where T = time to move the pointer to a target, D = distance between the pointer and the target, S = size of the target, k is a constant of approximately 200 ms/bit\". We incorporate Fitt's Law in our app design. Thus, we design items in the app such that they are big enough to enable users to spot them fast, especially as navigation proceeds further from the opening screen. Yet, these items are small enough to fit on the required screens, and hence users do not need to spend much time while searching.",

Mockups are multiple designs created by interviews with \"stakeholders\" that give an overview of the blueprint of the app [8] . Stakeholders in HCI terminology are various influential groups such as domain experts who have a thorough knowledge of the field; students/working professionals involved in providing data; and end-users ranging from novice to expert, and casual to frequent [8] . Among the mockups, we select the best designs for the app layout and screens. Other HCI aspects we incorporate are the simplicity and efficiency of the interface [20] . These include navigation, the time spent to find an answer to a question asked by the user, and the analytical graphs displayed. Considering HCI, some principles used in the app adhere to the guidelines of Google's material design [19] to ensure that the app is up to date with the current and latest software, and to warrant that the app runs smoothly without errors or bugs. Another HCI aspect is a \"metaphor\" [9] . The term metaphor refers to conceptualization of actions, typically for the interface. For example, a shopping cart is an interface metaphor used for checkout in online shopping. We incorporate metaphors in our app for various purposes, e.g. to depict different ordinance departments and smart city characteristics.",

Based on HCI principles, Fig. 2 illustrates the navigation of the app in an efficient manner to access the given information. For details, please see [21] . This navigation keeps the users engaged and alert. Another important factor is the specific usage to assess the emotions of users while navigating the app and seeing the results. In order to incorporate this, we make sure that the intermediate pages and end-results focus on inclusion and interactive design elements [19] . Based on these features, we implement the Ordinance-Tweet Mining App deploying Android Studio. Figure 3 illustrates the implementation process using UML for Android Development [23] with a self-explanatory diagram. For a more detailed explanation, please see [21] . Given this implementation, Fig. 4 shows a snapshot of the app layout. The left screen in the figure serves as a landing and welcome page with a call to action button labeled \"Get Started\". This lets the users know that they can access the app and navigate to the desired location. The center screen gives a brief description of the app. Once the users are ready to select an option, they can click on \"Select Ordinance Session\". The right screen serves as an action sheet. Action sheets are helpful whenever there are multiple actions [20] . They work well on this screen, since it shows the different options for the region and the sessions that the users can select. In order to evaluate the app, we conduct user surveys [21] . We create survey questions using a Likert Scale format [9] . We summarize the results in Figs. 6, 7 and 8. These encompass the feedback of 34 participants with an assortment of computer and environmental scientists, students, lawyers, policymakers and researchers.

Candy Lightner founded the \"Mothers against Drunk Driving (MADD)\" organization to ensure sterner laws against drunk driving [26] . Due to the media attention this organization received with Candy's story, it raised more awareness of driving responsibly. Likewise, our Ordinance-Tweet Mining App, the first of its kind, is likely to play an important role in making the public more aware of legislative policies and take action needed for enhancement. This concept fits the realm of Smart Governance [1, 2] , a characteristic of Smart Cities that leverages greater transparency in governing processes via more public involvement.",

The advantage is that the approach is semi-supervised, and works even with partly labeled data. Nuortimo [29] studies social media data from multiple platforms to understand public reactions for a system called Case Carbon Capture and Storage, to control carbon dioxide emissions. Results show that the overall reactions are positive. This study indicates that social media mining could be a great tool to measure public awareness and acceptance for topics related to energy and climate. Huang et al.

AI can help record car activity, foot traffic, types of shoppers that go to different retailers, their preferences, availability of parking spots etc. These are minor details yet they make big impacts to create efficient solutions [18] . AI can contribute to autonomous and semi-autonomous driving through incorporation of CSK-based techniques for enhanced decision-making [6, 32] . AI can play a role in augmenting object detection for Smart Mobility in Smart Cities with neural models, deep learning, CSK and adversarial datasets [6, 33, 35] . Another major aspect is AI in lighting. NYC has bright lights, which imply significant energy consumption. Thus, if lamppost design occurs with sensors, these can adjust their brightness depending on the amount of traffic within the area. In some cities such as Amsterdam, canal lights dim and brighten based on pedestrian usage [2]. Likewise, AI can contribute to several aspects of Smart Cities [34] . Our work in this paper is a step in this direction, using HCI-based app design and disseminating the results of mining ordinances along with their public reactions. Hence, this paper makes an impact on Smart Governance in Smart Cities.",
