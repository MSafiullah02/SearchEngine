Pediatric Diabetes 2006: 7: 146-152. Background: To investigate the role of infectious diseases in the development of type 1 diabetes, this study estimated the relative risks of type 1 diabetes immediately after infectious diseases. Research design and methods: A case-crossover design was employed. Information on infectious diseases during 407 d before the onset of type 1 diabetes was collected from medical records and parents' interviews for 260 patients in Chinese type 1 diabetes registry. The frequency of infectious diseases in 42 d before the onset of type 1 diabetes was compared with either the usual frequency of infectious diseases over the past year or the actual frequency of infectious diseases in a comparable 42-d control period. Results: Forty-eight (18%) patients were reported to have infectious diseases during this period based on medical records and interviews with parents. The relative risk of type 1 diabetes onset was markedly elevated to 10.1 (5.6, 17.9) immediately after infectious diseases, suggesting the role of infections as a precipitator. The relative risk decreased gradually before and after 42 d and was similar between male and female patients. Conclusion: The results showed that infectious diseases are associated with a large and transient increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes during 42 d after the infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Type 1 diabetes is one of the most important chronic diseases of children in the United States.

Infection is one of the most likely candidates that is involved in the development of type 1 diabetes. There is, however, surprisingly little direct evidence for infections causing diabetes on a population basis. Infection may be involved at two stages in the development of type 1 diabetes, first, as initiating factors which start the diabetogenic process and second, as precipitating factors which non-specifically precipitate clinical diabetes (8) . Research has demonstrated that exposure to infections during the gestational period, the neonatal period, and the early childhood might be associated with the initiation of the immune process leading to beta cell destruction and glucose intolerance years later (9) (10) (11) . Other studies suggested that infection could also act as precipitating factors, promoting an already ongoing autoimmune destructive process and leading to clinical diabetes (9, 12) . Evidence for congenital rubella and diabetes is very strong, but evidence for infections precipitating diabetes is not as convincing If outbreaks of infectious illness non-specifically precipitate type 1 diabetes, the traditional case-control study would not be suitable for investigating events immediately preceding the onset of type 1 diabetes. The development of the case-crossover method by Maclure (13) (14) (15) (16) offers an opportunity to investigate potential triggering factors. The design was originally employed to investigate events that might precipitate myocardial infarction (MI). As such, all subjects who entered the study were cases of MI. The frequency of potential triggering events during a 2-h hazard period before the onset of MI was contrasted to either the usual frequency or the frequency during a comparable 2-h control period. The 2-h hazard period was decided upon to detect the biologic events that might precipitate MI. Case-crossover methods are being used more and more in epidemiology to examine precipitating factors for such diverse endpoints as injuries, traffic accidents, and MI.

Therefore, it is most likely that certain types of virus play a more important role in precipitating type 1 diabetes.

Other researches also indicated that infections might modify the autoimmune process in an age-dependent manner and depending upon the timing and number of exposures (11, 28, 29) . Because of the small number of cases exposed to infection, we were unable to evaluate whether the risk of having type 1 diabetes differed among other subsets of patients.
