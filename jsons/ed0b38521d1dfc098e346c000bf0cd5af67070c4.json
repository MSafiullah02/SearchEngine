In 1967, U.S. Surgeon General William H. Stewart declared ''it was time to close the book on infectious diseases'' (Garrett, 1994, citing W.H. Stewart, '' A Mandate for State Action,'' presented at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, Washington, DC, December 4, 1967) . In the latter half of the twentieth century, many shared this bold view that medical science had vanquished infectious disease. As a result, public health struggled to remain relevant in the face of advances in pharmaceuticals, surgery, genetics and other areas that were becoming increasingly dominant in the quest to extend and enhance human life. SARS forced many to rethink the significance of public health and the crisis, though relatively short-lived, (for commentary on the disparities between the responses to HIV and SARS, see e.g. Altman (2003) ) underscored the need to rebuild public health capacity that had been allowed to slip down the health system priority list.",

Quarantine represents the archetypal conflict that confronts public health: the tension between society's dual interests in safeguarding individual liberty while protecting and promoting the health of its citizens. I identify legislative authority for imposing quarantine on individuals and discuss limits on its use. Although the law may confer broad authority on public health officials to impose measures like quarantine, I argue those officials ought to be guided by ethical principles in considering when to use coercive powers that abrogate individual liberties. To this end, I discuss ethical frameworks to guide and inform public health decision making. Finally, I comment on quarantine's impact on individuals, including psychological and economic impacts as well as its effect on the health care system.",

The disease traveled to Canada in late February 2003 when an elderly woman who acquired the disease in Hong Kong returned to her home in Toronto, Ontario, Canada's most populous metropolitan area with approximately 4.6 million people. She died 10 days after her return. Two days later, her 44-year-old son went to the emergency department of a major Toronto hospital, exhibiting high fever, a severe cough and difficulty in breathing -symptoms that a couple of weeks later would trigger alarm bells as a potential SARS case, but, at the time, health care workers did not know what confronted them. While awaiting admission, the man remained in an open area of a busy emergency department for 18-20 hours. This delay in admitting and isolating him was due, in part, to hospital overcrowding. Many patients and staff were exposed to the man before he was isolated. This patient died a week later. By then, public health officials realized that the mysterious disease outbreak in Asia had gained a foothold in Canada. 1 SARS began to spread to patients, health care workers and visitors in several hospitals in the Toronto area. Hospitals at the epicenter of the outbreak began closing emergency and intensive care services and refused new admissions. By late March 2003, the Ontario government amended its public health statute, the Health Protection and Promotion Act, to classify SARS as a reportable, communicable disease. With the addition of SARS to the statute, public health officials could trace infected individuals and their contacts and use measures, including quarantine, to try to limit the spread of disease.",

For example, anyone who had visited certain hospitals during specific time periods was asked to observe quarantine. One thousand and seven hundred high school students were quarantined after one student at the school became ill. In most cases, individuals complied with quarantine on a voluntary basis, but public health officials sought legally enforceable quarantine orders in a small number of cases. Svoboda et al. (2004) note that over 13,000 Toronto residents voluntarily complied with quarantine, and the city's public health department had to resort to mandatory orders in only 27 cases.

Its roots are in the quarantine of shipping vessels, primarily to prevent spread of contagion via infested cargo and persons. One commentator notes that quarantine practices have long been notorious for their ill-treatment of and cruelty to travelers. For centuries, travelers faced involuntary isolation based on arbitrary regulations and irrational fears in often unhealthy, degrading conditions, sometimes reinforced by the threat of execution. (Fidler, 2000, p. 289) Indeed, quarantine has a history of being imposed with a heavy hand by officials motivated by fear and prejudice rather than medical fact. In 1900, after the body of a bubonic plague victim was discovered in San Francisco's Chinatown, the U.S. President ordered quarantine of all Chinese and Japanese residents of the city based, in part, on ''the notion that Asians were particularly susceptible to plague because of their dietary reliance on rice rather than animal protein'' (Edelson, 2003 (Edelson, , p. 2874 .",

There is no evidence that quarantine was applied in a discriminatory manner in Canada during the 2003 SARS outbreak. In fact, those who were asked to observe quarantine represented a wide cross-section of the population and individuals disadvantaged by poverty, race or disability were not disproportionately represented. One survey of over a hundred Torontonians who were in quarantine revealed that 72% had a college education or higher and 48% had an annual household income of more than C$75,000 (Hawryluck et al., 2004) .

The provinces have primary authority over health care, though the federal government exercises some authority in the health sphere through its spending powers (i.e. the ability to tax citizens and redistribute funds to provincial governments for health-related programs), criminal law power, and ''peace, order and good government power,'' which authorizes the federal government to act during times of national emergency (Jackman, 2000) . The federal government also has explicit constitutional authority to quarantine persons and conveyances (such as airplanes and shipping vessels) entering and leaving the country. While provincial governments have authority to impose quarantine within provincial borders, the federal government's quarantine powers are concerned with the international movement of people and goods. Both federal and provincial quarantine powers came into play during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The federal Quarantine Act and regulations authorize the government of Canada to appoint quarantine officers who may detain and assess individuals entering and leaving the country who are suspected of having a contagious disease listed in the regulations (cholera, plague, smallpox and yellow fever) or any other dangerous disease (Quarantine Act, 1985, Sections 8, 11) . A ''dangerous disease'' is defined as one whose introduction to Canada ''would, in the opinion of the quarantine officer concerned, constitute a grave danger to public health in Canada'' (Quarantine Act, 1985, Section 2). Persons who are quarantined may appeal their detention to the federal Deputy Minister of Health or the Deputy's designate (Quarantine Act, 1985 , Section 9, 1368 .

(National Advisory Committee, 2003, p. 207) Before the SARS outbreak occurred, the Canadian government was in the process of reviewing its public health legislation, including the Quarantine Act. The emergence of SARS spurred the government to expedite legislative reform of the quarantine law, which was first enacted in 1872. In May 2004, the federal Minister of Health introduced a modernized statute in the Canadian Parliament, titled ''An Act to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases'' (Bill C-36). This law is aimed at focusing greater emphasis on air travel, the modern mode of global disease spread (Health Canada News Release, 2004) . The revised legislation also has a more extensive list of contagious diseases (which includes active pulmonary tuberculosis, anthrax, diphtheria, measles and poliomyelitis) and empowers the federal government to go so far as to close Canadian entry points to arrivals from a jurisdiction with an infectious disease outbreak. The federal government acknowledges that this would be ''an extreme measure'' (Health Canada News Release, 2004) .",

Consequently, Canada does not have a corpus of legal rulings that instruct how to apply specific Charter rights and the Section 1 justification test in regard to public health interventions. This contrasts with the United States, where courts have given specific instruction as to how to balance competing interests at stake in public health. For example, it has been noted that [t] he judge must defer to public health authorities on their choice of public health strategies. Public health orders get the most permissive judicial review y because they are based on objective criteria, are usually of limited duration, and are necessary to prevent imminent harm. (Richards & Rathbun, 2004, p. 356; Gostin, 2000) In two cases where courts have balanced claims of individual Charter rights against a broader public health interest, the latter has prevailed. The 1995 Ontario court decision in Canadian AIDS Society v. Ontario involved HIV testing of stored blood that had been donated some 11 years previously. When the blood was collected from the donors between 1984 and 1985, they were not advised that the blood would be tested for HIV as no such testing capacity existed at that time. When testing became available, the Canadian Red Cross Society tested the stored samples to trace any recipients of contaminated blood. Twenty-two HIV-positive donors were identified; nine of whom had previously been identified, leaving 13 remaining donors. The issue that arose in this case was whether the Red Cross should notify the donors and report them to the Province of Ontario in accordance with the Health Protection and Promotion Act. The Canadian AIDS Society objected to donor notification and reporting on the basis that the donors had not consented to testing their blood for HIV, and notification and reporting would violate the donors' privacy rights.",

The need for a code of ethics for public health, then, might be viewed as a code of restraint, a code to preserve fairly and appropriately the negative rights of citizens to noninterference. (Kass, 2001 (Kass, , p. 1777 Clearly, a number of ethical values come into play in the public health response to outbreaks of infectious diseases like SARS. Members of the Joint Centre for Bioethics at the University of Toronto have enumerated the following as ten key values: individual liberty; protection of the public from harm; proportionality; reciprocity; transparency; privacy; protection of communities from undue stigmatization; duty to provide care; equity; and solidarity (Singer et al., 2003) . Gostin, Bayer, and Fairchild (2003) detail similar values. They cite the precautionary principle as central to public health ethics, which requires that steps be taken to protect the public against reasonably foreseeable threats, even in a climate of medical and scientific uncertainty. They emphasize principles of ''least restrictive alternatives,'' justice, and transparency, within which are subsumed concerns with individual liberty, fairness, privacy and due process. Kass (2001) suggests a six-step framework to guide public health officials in choosing an ethically-sound course of action by evaluating the various options available to them. She argues first that the goals of a public health intervention must be identified. In the context of quarantine, the purpose is to limit the spread of an infectious disease by segregating those who may carry the disease from uninfected individuals. Next, officials ought to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention in achieving its goals. Quarantine clearly will not be effective in reducing spread of a disease that is not transmissible by ordinary community contact. Kass states that ''[t]he question for policy and ethics analysis, then, is what quantity of data is enough to justify a program's implementation? As a rule of thumb, the greater the burdens posed by a program the stronger the evidence must be to demonstrate that the program will achieve its goals'' (Kass, 2001 (Kass, , p. 1778 .",

Quarantine restricts individual liberty by limiting freedom of movement, and imposes various psychosocial burdens that I discuss in greater detail below. As the fourth step in the analysis, it is important to consider whether the burdens of an intervention can be minimized while retaining its efficacy. As Kass (2001) points out: ''If 2 options exist to address a public health problem, we are required, ethically, to choose the approach that poses fewer risks to other moral claims, such as liberty, privacy, opportunity and justice. Making this assessment relies on the existence of sound data'' (p. 1780).

Suddenly we were faced with a whole new challenge -how to communicate with large numbers of staff at home y . The hospital's informatics staff quickly established a ''lifeline'' for staff by providing access to their hospital email from home and created a password-protected SARS Internet site through our website. This enabled staff to stay on top of what was happening at the hospital during their absence and reduced their reliance on media for information. (McBride, 2003, p. 52) In addition to psychosocial impacts on health care workers, quarantine and other measures used to control the spread of SARS had major consequences on access to health care. The ''Code Orange'' directive that required hospitals to restrict access to all but the most critically ill patients meant that a vast number of services, including surgeries and other procedures such as radiation therapy for cancer patients, were cancelled (Bernstein, 2003) . The quarantine of health care workers exacerbated this already difficult situation. The National Advisory Commission (2003, pp. 155-160) estimates the cost of addressing the surgical backlog at $32.1 million. In addition, family and friends of patients in hospital were either not allowed to visit, or access for visitors was severely restricted (Bernstein, 2003) .",

(Hawryluck et al., 2004 (Hawryluck et al., , p. 1210 Quarantine also had significant economic consequences. Thousands of employees lost income while they stayed home to observe quarantine or provide care for others who were quarantined. It has been argued that the ethical value of reciprocity demands that the state compensate those whom it asks to stay home from work to comply with quarantine (Singer et al., 2003) . Expressed in practical terms, [a] person potentially missing a mortgage or car payment may face a strong temptation to break quarantine in order not to lose earnings. By promising compensation, the government creates incentives to stay home, and thereby limits the risk that SARS may spread, thus reducing the economic dislocation caused by the disease. (Iacobucci, 2003, p. A24) Some people had to use vacation time or take unpaid leave in order to observe quarantine. It has been observed that ''the initial refusal of governments to recognize the lack of an income cushion for Torontonians obeying quarantine orders clearly contributed to reluctance of some to stay away from work, further spreading SARS'' (Canadian Public Health Association, 2003, p. 12) .

Given the litigious nature of people in North America in particular, and to a lesser degree in western Europe, the control of SSEs [super-spreading events] in these regions might have presented greater problems if mass quarantining had been required. (Anderson et al., 2004 (Anderson et al., , p. 1104 A representative of the American Civil Liberties Union, echoing this concern, points out that ''North American litigiousness'' is far more characteristic of the United States than Canada: ''I think Americans will be more skeptical about quarantine proposals than Canadians are, and probably more anxious to exercise their legal rights'' (Tuller, 2003, p. Fl) . Indeed, it is important to keep in mind that the law, particularly constitutionally-entrenched rights and freedoms, places important limits on the use of coercive public health interventions. As well, ethical principles serve to restrain the exercise of public health powers. In deciding whether to interfere with individual liberty during a disease outbreak, law and ethics both demand that officials ask themselves the following question: ''Does a coercive intervention truly reduce aggregate health risks, and what, if any, less intrusive interventions might reduce those risks as well or better?'' (Gostin, 2000, p. 20) It is arguable that quarantine was overused during the SARS outbreak and, in many cases, was likely not a truly effective measure in reducing disease spread. Commentators have suggested that ''in hindsight, overrecognition of contacts, especially in two hospital-wide quarantine efforts, may have resulted in an overestimate of the number of persons requiring quarantine'' (Svoboda et al., 2004 (Svoboda et al., , p. 2360 ). Yet, the phrase ''in hindsight'' is significant and public health officials clearly must have some degree of latitude when responding to a novel disease outbreak. Interventions that are based on up-to-date evidence and that are not applied in an arbitrary, unfair or discriminatory manner are most likely to pass legal and ethical scrutiny.",

Law can impede that process y or it can enhance it y'' The crucial role of law in public health is highlighted by the national and provincial commissions of inquiry that have analyzed the Canadian SARS outbreak and recommended strategies to equip the public health system for the next outbreak. For example, the National Advisory Commission (2003) comments on a number of legal and ethical issues associated with the outbreak and in a discussion aptly titled ''Legal Confusion,'' the Ontario SARS Commission (2004) highlights legal ambiguities that hindered an effective outbreak response. These include concerns as to which level of government was ultimately in charge of the outbreak and the lawful authority of public health officials to take steps to control the disease.",

Various provincial governments also are reviewing their public health laws. The SARS experience taught officials that legislation authorizing public health interventions like screening, isolation, quarantine and treatment must be sufficiently flexible to allow rapid response to a new infectious agent. For example, many public health statutes have schedules listing various infectious diseases for which coercive interventions are warranted. Such lists must be capable of swift amendment so that officials are not hamstrung in their ability to respond to a disease outbreak because a novel agent is not yet covered by public health legislation. Similarly, the SARS experience reveals that officials ought to have the legal authority to implement class quarantine orders as it may be unworkable to issue individual orders to thousands of people. The mandated length of quarantine must be based on the best available evidence in order to ensure that individual liberty is not restricted longer than necessary.",
