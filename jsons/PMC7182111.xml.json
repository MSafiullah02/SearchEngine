Rawlings began his academic career as a laboratory technician in the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin, before moving to Alan Barrett\u2019s laboratory in the Strangeways Research Institute in Cambridge, and subsequently the Babraham Institute. He did his doctorate under Dr Barrett, and his thesis was entitled \u201cEvolution and Classification of Peptidases\u201d. During this time the classification of peptidase structures and sequences into clans and families was developed. The move to the Babraham Institute brought with it Internet access and so the MEROPS database and website were developed. Dr Rawlings and Dr Barrett moved to the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in 2002 as part of the team run by Dr Alex Bateman, which brought the benefits of contact with experienced programmers and web developers. Always a keen birdwatcher, it is no surprise that the MEROPS database is named after a genus of birds.",

Almost all of these have been brought into the clan on the basis of structures that are known from crystallographic data to be similar. The other families are assigned to clan CA because they contain similar sequence motifs around the catalytic residues (Figure 404.2, Figure 404.3, Figure 404.4, Figure 404.5, Figure 404.6, Figure 404.7\n). Besides Cys158 and His292 of the catalytic dyad, two other residues are important for catalysis in papain and its relatives (numbering as in MEROPS database). These are a Gln152 that helps in the formation of the \u2018oxyanion hole\u2019, an electrophilic center that stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate, and Asn308 (sometimes Asp in families C12, C28 and C39), which is thought to orientate the imidazolium ring of the catalytic His (Chapter 405). The order of these residues in the sequence is Gln, Cys, His, Asn/Asp, and in mature papain, the numbering is Gln19, Cys25, His159 and Asn175. In family C19, asparagine serves the same function as Gln152. No equivalent of Gln152 has been identified in the foot-and-mouth disease virus L-endopeptidase. The catalytic cysteine is usually followed by an aromatic, hydrophobic amino acid, but glycine occupies this position in some peptidases of family C2 and all those of family C12.",

The evolutionary tree (see the MEROPS database) shows that the family is divided into two subfamilies, C1A (or papain subfamily) and C1B (or bleomycin hydrolase subfamily). It may well be that a peptidase of family C1 was present in the universal ancestor of all organisms, and that this evolved into a subfamily C1A-type protein in early archaea and a subfamily C1B-type protein in early bacteria. Further divergence would have occurred in the separate groups of organisms, and horizontal transfers can explain the presence of a C1A homolog in Clostridium and of bleomycin hydrolase in eukaryotes.",

Cathepsins B and H (Chapters 406 and 408Chapter 406Chapter 408) both possess endopeptidase activity, but arguably are more important for their exopeptidase activities. Cathepsin B acts as a peptidyl-dipeptidase, releasing C-terminal dipeptides, and this activity is attributable to the existence of an extended loop that forms a cap to the active-site cleft, and carries a pair of His residues that are thought to bind the C-terminal carboxylate of the substrate (Figure 404.9\n). Cathepsin X is a rather specific carboxypeptidase (Chapter 415).",

Most members of family C1 have propeptides homologous to that of papain, but the propeptide of cathepsin B is much shorter and very different in sequence. However, the propeptides of both cathepsin B and papain are thought to act in the same way in the proenzymes, blocking the active site by being bound in the reverse orientation to a substrate, as can be seen from the structure of procathepsin B (Figure 404.10\n). Papain-like propeptides may be identified from the presence of the ERFNIN motif, in which some of the following residues (numbered according to the papain propeptide) are conserved: Glu64, Arg68, Phe72, Asn75, Asn83, Phe96, Asp98 and Glu103. The papain propeptide is homologous to proteins CTLA-2\u03b1 and CTLA-2\u03b2 of activated T cells, which have been shown to be cysteine endopeptidase inhibitors [3]. It is notable that residue Pro2 is often conserved in the mature peptidases of family C1 (see the alignment in MEROPS), and this may prevent attack by aminopeptidases, since the Xaa-Pro bond is resistant to many such enzymes.",

The heavy chain is a mosaic protein containing the peptidase domain (domain II) (Figure 404.12\n) and also a C-terminal domain (domain IV) with four calcium-binding EF-hand structures. The calcium-binding domain is homologous to calcium-binding domains in other proteins. The functions of heavy chain domains I and III are unknown. Crystal structures of calcium-free human calpain have been described [6], [7], and they show that in the absence of calcium the peptidase unit adopts a conformation that disrupts the catalytic site. In most mammalian cells there are two calpains with different calcium requirements for activity: calpain-1 (Chapter 454) and calpain-2 (Chapter 455). Calpain 3 (Chapter 456) has a 48 residue insert in the catalytic domain between the catalytic Cys and His. A number of atypical calpains are known, in which the domains N-terminal and C-terminal to the protease domain are different from those in the typical calpains, and a small subunit may not be required for activity. A Drosophila homolog of calpain possesses an insert in the C-terminal domain, and there is evidence that differential splicing can give rise to a form lacking the calcium-binding domain [8]. Another calpain homolog exists in Drosophila and is involved in the development of the small optic lobe. This putative endopeptidase is the product of the sol gene, and the protein is predicted to be multidomain, including six zinc fingers as well as a peptidase domain, but no calcium-binding domain [9] (Figure 404.12).

Ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid protein that is attached to other proteins as a signal for intracellular translocation or degradation (usually mediated by the proteasome). Ubiquitin is attached through the carboxyl group of its C-terminal glycine residue either to the N-terminus of another polypeptide or to the \u03b1-amino group of a lysine residue, which forms an isopeptide bond (Chapters 460\u2013462Chapter 460Chapter 461Chapter 462). Ubiquitin may also be attached to another molecule of ubiquitin, and proteins targeted for degradation may be polyubiquitinated. In order for ubiquitin to be recycled there is a need for peptidases to liberate the free ubiquitin by hydrolysis of the C-terminal glycyl bond. Peptidases that release ubiquitin from conjugates are known as \u2018ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases\u2019 or \u2018deubiquitinylating enzymes\u2019. Because release of ubiquitin may involve cleavage of an isopeptide bond, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases are not classified as peptidases in Enzyme Nomenclature but as thiolester hydrolases. There are at least eight families of deubiquitinylating enzymes in clan CA, and there are enzymes in other, unrelated, families, including the metallopeptidase AMSH (family M67) which is a component of the 26S proteasome (Chapter 817). There are over 100 different deubiquitinylating enzymes in humans, which implies a sophisticated network controlling translocation and degradation of proteins which is only just being understood.",

Family C65 includes the otubains (see Chapter 477). The tertiary structure of otubain-2 has been determined and shows that the fold is similar to that of papain [18]. Otubain-1 has been shown to cleave Lys48-linked polyubiquitin [19]. The CylD protein from family C67 (see Chapter 476) has been shown to have de-ubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains [20]. The tertiary structure has been solved [21]. Family C85 includes the DUBA deubiquitinylating peptidase, which has been shown to cleave the lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains on tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 [22]. However, no tertiary structure has been solved for any member of the family, and the active site residues are predictions only [15]. Ataxin-3 (Chapter 479) is yet another deubiquitinating enzyme and a member of family C86. The nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the domain containing the active site of ataxin-3, known as the Josephin domain, has been determined [23], and shows the characteristics of a cysteine peptidase in clan CA. Family C88 includes OTU1 peptidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Chapter 478) which preferentially cleaves longer polyubiquitin chains with Lys48 linkages.

Such duplications appear to have been as ancient as the speciation events that gave rise to the different viruses, because there is no significant sequence similarity, and hence the peptidases are in different families.",

The L-peptidase is sited at the N-terminus of the polyprotein, from which it releases itself. The L-peptidase also cleaves the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-4G (formerly known as p220 or eIF-4\u03b3), thus preventing cap-dependent synthesis of host-cell proteins.",

Besides the three papain-like cysteine endopeptidases, the arteriviruses possess a fourth, serine-type, endopeptidase (see Chapter 691) in the pol polyprotein. Not all arteriviruses require all four endopeptidases, because in the equine arteritis virus, PCP\u03b1 is inactive, the catalytic Cys being replaced by Lys. The PCP\u03b1 endopeptidase releases itself from the N-terminus of the Nsp1 protein [42]. The PCP\u03b1 endopeptidase cleaves between the Nsp1 and Nsp2 proteins in the pol polyprotein [42]. The Nsp2 endopeptidase cleaves between the Nsp2 and Nsp3 proteins, and, unusually, the catalytic Cys is followed by Gly.

Formerly termed clan CB, this has the catalytic dyad in the order His, Cys in the sequence. A comparison of sequence motifs led Bazan and Fletterick [45] to suggest that the polyprotein processing cysteine endopeptidases of several single, positive-stranded RNA viruses were structurally related to chymotrypsin, and this was confirmed when the crystal structures of picornains 3C from human hepatitis A virus (Chapter 541) (Figure 404.20\n) and human rhinovirus type 14 (Chapter 537) were found to share the two \u03b2-barrel fold of chymotrypsin. There now seems no doubt that these peptidases have evolved from a common ancestor with chymotrypsin. The catalytic His of picornain 3C (in family C3) is equivalent in position to His57 of chymotrypsin, and the Cys replaces Ser195 (see the representation of two-dimensional structures for clan PA, see Figure 559.2). In rhinovirus picornain 2A a His, Asp, Cys catalytic triad is seen [46], but the Asp is replaced by Glu in some other members of family C3. The viral endopeptidases and chymotrypsin clearly belong in the same clan, and because the clan contains both cysteine-type and serine-type peptidases it has been named clan PA. The clan is divided into subclan PA(S), for the serine peptidases, and subclan PA(C) for the cysteine peptidases. Families C4, C24, C30, C37 and C38 also contain endopeptidases from RNA viruses that are predicted to have the chymotrypsin fold, and are placed in subclan PA(C) together with family C3.",

In subclan PA(C) the active site Cys is followed by Gly (like the Ser in chymotrypsin) whereas in clan CA the catalytic Cys is generally followed by a large hydrophobic residue. As regards function, the endopeptidases of subclan PA(C) tend to be general processing enzymes, cleaving several bonds in the polyprotein, whereas those in clan CA generally perform only a single cleavage. There is also a difference in P1 substrate specificity: in subclan PA(C) cleavage is commonly at a Gln\u2193Gly bond, whereas in clan CA cleavage usually occurs at a Gly\u2193Gly bond. The subclan PA(C) endopeptidase is usually positioned between the helicase and the RNA polymerase in the polyprotein, whereas the clan CA enzyme usually precedes both the helicase and the RNA polymerase. Taken together with other indications that the positive-stranded RNA viruses are evolutionarily related, the similar locations of the subclan PA(C) endopeptidases in the genomes is entirely consistent with a common evolutionary origin of all of the peptidases in the subclan. The high rate of mutation of RNA viruses, lacking proofreading in the replication of the genome, could rapidly have obscured sequence relationships between the sequences.",

Moreover, they saw similar motifs in the cysteine peptidases of families C11 (clostripain) and C25 (gingipain R). They proposed the existence of a clan CD of cysteine peptidases with a protein fold similar to that already known for the caspases (family C14). The proposal soon received support from the crystal structure of gingipain R2. The structure of caspase 1 (see Figure 404.22\n, Chapter 503) shows a distinctive \u03b1/\u03b2 fold quite unlike those of clans CA and PA. In the sequence motif described by Chen et al.\n[57], the catalytic histidine is preceded by a block of hydrophobic residues and a glycine, and the catalytic cysteine is preceded by a second block of hydrophobic residues, a glutamine and an alanine (see Figure 404.23, Figure 404.24\n. A similar motif has been recognized in separase (family C50), RTX self-cleaving toxin(family C80) and prtH peptidase (family C84), and all three families have been added to clan CD. Similar motifs are present in proteins not yet known to be peptidases [58] so the clan may expand still further.",

Smt3 and the animal equivalent SUMO-1 (also known as sentrin) are proteins that target other proteins for export from the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex protein RANBP2. Smt3 and SUMO-1 are distantly related to ubiquitin, and like ubiquitin possess C-terminal glycine residues that can be linked in isopeptide bonds. Unlike ubiquitin, Smt3 and SUMO-1 do not target proteins for degradation, and do not form homopolymers, because the lysine essential to that process is not present. The Ulp1 endopeptidase releases Smt3 from its precursor by removing three C-terminal residues to expose the -Gly-Gly C-terminus; the mammalian equivalent, SENP1-endopeptidase, removes four C-terminal residues. Ulp1 endopeptidase can also release Smt3 from targeted proteins. The enzyme is normally localized to the periphery of the nucleus, but is found within the nucleus during mitotic anaphase.",

The reaction is cleavage of a conserved Gly258\u2193Cys259 bond, and a cholesterol moiety is simultaneously attached to the new C-terminal glycyl residue of the N-terminal domain. The 18-kDa N-terminal domain is structurally related to a zinc D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase in clan MD; it is not known to have any peptidase activity but has a function in the embryological development of dorsal-ventral patterning. Mutational studies have shown that residues Cys258 and His329 in the 25-kDa C-terminal domain are essential for the autolytic cleavage [86]. The reaction is not inhibited by any standard peptidase inhibitors, but requires DTT in vitro. The cleavage mechanism is believed to be similar to that of the activation of prohistidine decarboxylase [87], involving activation of Cys258 by His329 for a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of Gly257. There is a motif around the cleavage site that is similar to that found at the N-terminal splice junction of self-splicing proteins (Chapter 76), and splicing may involve a thioester intermediate [88]. The crystal structure of the Sonic hedgehog C-terminal domain (Figure 404.32\n) shows that it consists of two tandem intein-like repeats [89], and family C46 is now included in a clan of mixed catalytic types, PD, along with the three intein families (see Chapter 76) [90].",

Members of the clan are involved in hydrolysis of bacterial cell wall peptides. Family C60 includes peptidases known as sortases (Chapter 551) from Gram-positive bacteria, and sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus cleaves proteins at a Leu-Pro-Xaa-Thr\u2193Gly motif, and then catalyzes the formation of an amide bond between the newly exposed C-terminal Thr and the cross-linking pentapeptide of the bacterial cell wall [91]. The proteins that are attached in this way to the exterior of the cell wall can be virulence factors, and inhibition of sortases has been shown to decrease virulence. Surprisingly, given a lack of structural relationship to members of clan CA, sortases are inhibited by E-64. The evolutionary tree shows a deep divergence within the family, which is divided into two subfamilies. Subfamily C60A includes sortase A, whereas C60B includes sortase B.

Most of the cleavages are performed by hepacivirin (Chapter 688), which is a serine-type endopeptidase with a trypsin-like fold. Cleavage of the NS2/3 site at a Leu\u2193Ala bond is mediated by the second virally encoded endopeptidase, endopeptidase 2, often termed the \u2018NS2-3 endopeptidase\u2019, not because of the cleavage site but because the endopeptidase consists of the NS2 protein and one-third of the NS3 protein (Chapter 554). Endopeptidase 2 is included in family C18. Site-directed mutagenesis had identified His952 and Cys993 as the catalytic dyad [95]. However, evidence that the NS2-3 endopeptidase is zinc dependent, including inhibition by EDTA and increased activity with the addition of zinc [96], had cast doubt on the identification of the catalytic type. The tertiary structure has been determined, and shows a fold unrelated to that of any other peptidase, hence family C18 is the only family in clan CM (see Figure 404.34\n). The active peptidase is a homodimer, and each monomer comprises an N-terminal, helical subdomain, a C-terminal subdomain with a \u03b2-sheet and an extended linker region. The active site His and Glu are situated in the N-terminal domain and the Cys in the C-terminal domain. An active site is only formed in the dimer, when the His and Glu from one monomer oppose the Cys from the other, thus the NS2 dimer has two active sites [97]. The formation of an active site between different subunits in a dimer is unusual amongst peptidases, but does happen with retropepsins (see Chapter 44) and has been proposed for the Pyrococcus furiosus protease 1 (see Chapter 549). The tertiary structure of the NS2 dimer also revealed the presence of a structural zinc ion, which explains the metal-dependence.",

This is an enzyme that is expressed during sporulation, and is responsible for degradation of bacterial cell wall components.

There are a number of homologs of the Bacillus endopeptidase, but similarity is restricted to a C-terminal domain of 110 residues. These include nlpC lipoprotein from Escherichia coli, invasion-associated protein p60 from Listeria species, a starch-degrading enzyme from Clostridium acetobutylicum, and a phosphatase-associated protein from Bacillus subtilis. There are single conserved Cys and His residues). The crystal structures of several members of the family have been solved, and the fold has been described as \u2018papain-like\u2019 but primitive [101]. However, unlike papain where the catalytic Cys is at the N-terminus of a helix, in the structures from family C40 the active site Cys is at the C-terminus of a helix, which means the sequence must run in the opposite direction to that in papain (see Figure 404.38\n). No similarity between the structures can be detected using the DALI algorithm [102].
