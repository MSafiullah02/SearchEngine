SIC is a precursor state to DIC and associated with elevated prothrombin time (PT), elevated D-dimer, and thrombocytopenia, but without hypofibrinogenemia. It is related to an infection-induced systemic inflammatory response with endothelial dysfunction and microthrombosis with organ failure and usually no bleeding [4]. In a multivariate analysis of a retrospective series of 440 severe COVID-19 patients, the predictors of 28-day mortality were age, prothrombin time, D-dimer levels, and thrombocytopenia. Patients with elevated D-dimer or SIC score had lower mortality when treated with heparin (mostly low molecular weight) compared with those not treated with heparin. A case series of 3 patients with respiratory failure and high D-dimer levels reported transient improvement in respiratory parameters with the use of tissue plasminogen activator [5]. The lung pathology in one COVID-19 patient revealed microvascular thrombosis suggesting that the lung microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19 patients may contribute to respiratory failure and ARDS [5].",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a member of the coronavirus family. The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via its spike (S) protein [9]. Transmembrane protein serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is also required for viral entry into cells [10]. Similarly, the virus that caused the SARS pandemic in 2003, SARS-CoV-1, also binds to ACE2 [11, 12]. ACE2 is a dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidase, a homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1), and part of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Renin secreted from juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney cleaves angiotensinogen produced by the liver to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is cleaved by ACE1 to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II binds to angiotensin 1 (AT1) and angiotensin 2 (AT2) receptors and its binding to AT1 leads to vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion with sodium and water retention, proinflammatory and procoagulation effects, and elevated blood pressure. Angiotensin II worsens heart failure and worsens ARDS. AT1 blockers are widely used antihypertensive drugs and have beneficial effects in organ protection including the brain.",

Angiotensin (1-7) produces vasodilatation and has anti-inflammatory effects via its binding to the Mas receptor. Activation of ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis leads to beneficial cardioprotective and neuroprotective actions that counter-regulate the harmful actions of ACE1/angiotensin II/AT1 axis (reviewed in [13, 14]). In rodent models of stroke, angiotensin (1-7) is neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory [15\u201317].",

ACE2 in the lung declines with age and the decrease in males with age is greater than that in females [21]. Meanwhile, the ACE1-angiotensin II system activity increases with age [22]. The depletion of ACE2 by the SARS-CoV-2 virus coupled with the age-related decline in ACE2 and increase of ACE-1-Ang II tips the balance in favor of ACE-1/angiotensin II with proinflammatory and organ damaging effects. This may explain the higher mortality in the elderly and in men seen in the COVID-19 pandemic.",
