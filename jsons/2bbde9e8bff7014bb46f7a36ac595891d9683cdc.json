Adapting to life with SARS-CoV-2 in our midst is rapidly becoming an option that countries are starting to exercise [2] . Appropriate triage and rationing of medical supplies are becoming even more important as a result. Moving forwards, prognostic clinical scoring systems for COVID-19 will become valuable tools, as they can potentially allow early identification of individuals who are at high risk of poor outcomes and require intensive clinical resources. These high-risk individuals may also be candidates for earlier, more aggressive interventions [3, 4] .",

Calibration-in-the-large (CITL) indicates the difference between the observed prevalence and the mean predicted probability, which should be zero. This population-based level does not guarantee calibrated risks at the individual patient level [9] . The calibration slope indicates whether the model coefficients are underfitted (slope > 1) or overfitted (slope < 1). Thus the calibration slope expresses predictions that are too extreme or not extreme enough.
