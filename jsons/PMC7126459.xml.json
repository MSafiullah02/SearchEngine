To increase sample size and get reliable state-specific H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage, the cumulative proportion of people vaccinated during the 2009\u20132010 season was used in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis procedure. Multivariable analyses using logistic regression models were performed between HCP and non-HCP to get adjusted percentages.9, 10\n",
