Less is known about the importance of individual variation in infectiousness among diseases associated with chronically carried bacterial pathogens. Chronic carriage/shedding is common features of several pathogenic bacteria, so understanding infection risks posed by chronic carrier individuals is relevant to management of infectious diseases across human, domestic animal, and wildlife health sectors (Buhnerkempe et al., 2017; Coyne et al., 2006; Wertheim et al., 2005).",

Bighorn pneumonia frequently manifests as an initial all\u2010age outbreak causing 5%\u2013100% mortality (Cassirer et al., 2018; Enk, Picton, & Williams, 2001; Spraker, Hibler, Schoonveld, & Adney, 1984), followed by annual epizootics among juveniles and sporadic pneumonia mortality among adults (Cassirer et al., 2013; Smith, Jenks, Grovenburg, & Klaver, 2014). Previous unsuccessful attempts to control pneumonia targeted Pasteurellaceae (Bibersteinia trehalosi, Mannheimia haemolytica, leukotoxigenic Pasteurella) and parasites (Protostongylus sp.) (Dassanayake et al., 2009; Foreyt, Snipes, & Kasten, 1994; Miller et al., 2000). While Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (Mo) is more strongly associated with pneumonia than previously targeted pathogens (Besser et al., 2008, 2013), no vaccines or efficacious antimicrobial treatments for Mo currently exist. Interventions for any pathogen(s) are also constrained by inaccessible terrain, as well as the complex movement patterns of bighorn sheep (Cassirer et al., 2018; George, Martin, Lukacs, & Miller, 2008). Thus, effective management strategies for addressing bighorn sheep pneumonia are currently lacking and clearly needed to conserve the species.",

Plowright et al. (2017) found that about half of bighorn sheep testing positive for Mo consistently tested positive, implying chronic carriage. We therefore hypothesized that pneumonia could be maintained in bighorn sheep populations by a few identifiable, chronic carrier individuals (Figure 1). We tested the hypothesis in free\u2010ranging bighorn sheep populations in the Black Hills of South Dakota, USA: the Custer State Park treatment population and the Rapid City control population (Figure 2). Our objectives were to determine whether removing chronic carrier individuals (a) reduces the prevalence of Mo, (b) reduces pneumonia\u2010related mortality, and (c) reduces overall mortality.",

For late\u2010caught lambs, we imputed missing birth weight and birth timing values using the empirical distributions of these variables for lambs caught as neonates (Gelman et al., 2014).",

Our framework first calculated hazard of dying irrespective of cause of death (Cross et al., 2015) using weakly informative truncated normal priors on the baseline log unit cumulative hazards. We assumed a mean annual adult survival of 86% and a 95% probability of lying between 20% and 95% (y ~ Normal [\u22123.745, \u03c3\n2 = 0.29] T[\u22129.5, \u22122]; Loison et al., 1999), and 50% mean annual lamb survival with a 95% probability of lying between 10% and 80% (y ~ Normal [\u22126.26, \u03c3\n2 = 0.33] T[\u22128, \u22121]; Parr, Smith, Jenks, & Thompson, 2018). We specified an intrinsically conditional autoregressive prior (Cressie & Wikle, 2011) for the week effect in adults and day effect in lambs (\u03c1j) to provide temporal smoothing across unit log hazard estimates. Specifically, we assigned a prior with a uniform distribution (\u03c1l ~ Uniform [\u22120.5, 0.5]) for the first week or day effect and specified the effect for the j\nth week or day as \u03c1j ~ Normal (\u03c1j\n\u22121, \u03c3\n2 = 1/\u03c4).

We detected other pneumonia\u2010associated pathogens in both populations, but their presence failed to induce pneumonia in adults or lambs in the absence of Mo (Table 1).

These individuals therefore were not intermittently carrying a single strain of Mo. More likely, they lacked strain\u2010specific immunity and were acutely carrying the introduced strain of Mo (Cassirer et al., 2017). Importantly, they were not contributing to the persistence of the original strain.

For adults, our best survival model included a treatment effect and was significantly better (i.e., \u22652 \u0394WAIC) than models lacking this effect; however, the effect was not statistically significant. This finding may indicate that the treatment effect was biologically important, but a larger sample size is needed to assess statistical significance given the overall high survival rates of both the treatment and control populations.

We attempted to control for this complication by explicitly analyzing the impact of this introduction on survival, and our modeling efforts demonstrated the strain effect was statistically insignificant relative to the treatment effect, and did not appear in any competing model. Therefore, strain introduction did not change our conclusions about the impact of chronic carrier removal in Mo\u2010affected populations.",

(2017) found that age and homozygosity at a specific locus were associated with persistent carriage of Mo in bighorn sheep, suggesting possible host factors that might contribute to variation in infectious period and carriage rates among populations. Coinfections, underlying disease, and high exposure frequency and/or dose may also shape host resistance to infection and increase likelihood of chronic or intermittent carriage (Fox et al., 2015). Chronic carriers might also be individuals that adopt a strategy of tolerance (limiting the harm caused by a given parasite burden) rather than resistance (limiting parasite burden) to combat Mo. This predisposition for tolerance has a genetic basis and is variable among individuals within a species (R\u00e5berg, Graham, & Reed, 2009). Identifying factors associated with carriage status would provide insight into temporal variation in disease dynamics and population response to infection. The ability to determine the likelihood of intermittent versus chronic carriage at an individual or population level would also help minimize the sampling effort required to efficiently identify chronic carriers. Our results indicate the minimum required sampling intensity will vary across populations.",

However, complete depopulation of wildlife is not always feasible, especially in rugged or remote terrain (Courchamp, Chapuis, & Pascal, 2003). Furthermore, while depopulation removes the pathogen along with its host, ensuing reintroductions may fail (Griffith, Scott, Carpenter, & Reed, 1989), with political and economic consequences. Population\u2010level knowledge also can accumulate and transmit across generations (Jesmer et al., 2018), affecting a population's ability to follow green\u2010up, avoid predation, and maintain complex migration routes. This knowledge has implications for fitness and is lost with depopulation. While identifying chronic carriers may not be feasible everywhere, selective removal preserves knowledge that may promote population persistence and growth following treatment.",

            "text": "Our study provides experimental evidence for chronic carriage as a mechanism for pathogen (and disease) persistence, and our results may apply to chronic infections across taxa. Chronic carriers enable Leptospirosa interrogans to persist through \u201cinter\u2010epidemic troughs\u201d in California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) populations and may play an important role in the spillover of Hendra, Nipah, Marburg, and Ebola from bats to humans and other mammals (Buhnerkempe et al., 2017; Plowright et al., 2016). Test\u2010and\u2010remove methods aimed at carriers, such as the one presented in our experiment, are few and have met varied success. For instance, attempts to remove elk testing seropositive for Brucella abortus from herds in Wyoming failed to eliminate the pathogen (Scurlock, Edwards, Cornish, & Meadows, 2010). Similarly, culling European badgers (Meles meles) in Great Britain counterintuitively increased Mycobacterium bovis spillover to nearby cattle herds (Donnelly et al., 2003). An important distinction that may account for the success of our intervention as opposed to these examples is that we removed all chronic carriers. In humans, Staphylococcus aureus is similar to Mo in that the nares are the primary carriage site and carriers can be classified into chronic, intermittent, and noncarrier categories (Wertheim et al., 2005). Isolating patients that chronically carry S. aureus can, but does not always, prevent subsequent infection in at\u2010risk hospital patients (Peterson & Schora, 2016; Wertheim et al., 2005). One notable difference between S. aureus and Mo is length of environmental persistence, which may explain inconsistent results of S. aureus chronic carrier isolation. Mo persists for only minutes in the environment (Citti & Blanchard, 2013), whereas S. aureus can persist for months, increasing reinfection opportunities (Neely & Maley, 2000). Environmental persistence and presence of reservoir hosts are important factors to consider when contemplating chronic carrier removal/treatment for a new disease system.",

Health interventions are often expensive and urgent, and knowledge regarding where to focus limited resources can save money and lives. Focusing resources on identifying and treating chronically carrying individuals can lead to population\u2010level disease clearance, but the appropriateness of this focus depends on how the disease is spread and maintained within and between populations. As infectious disease outbreaks increase globally (Jones et al., 2008), broadening our understanding of various transmission patterns will be integral to mitigating disease outbreaks and conserving at\u2010risk wildlife populations.",
