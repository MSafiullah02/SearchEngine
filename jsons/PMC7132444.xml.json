            "text": "Feline retroviruses, notably feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), induce chronic infections which eventually lead to the progressive weakening of cats and the presence of various clinical signs. In advanced stages of the disease, the immune suppression established may contribute to the death of the animal (review in Hartmann, 2006, Sellon and Hartmann, 2006). Treatment of animal retroviral diseases is usually based on supportive and symptomatic therapy, such as rehydration when needed, control of secondary infections with antibiotics, antiparasitic and antifungal drugs, among others, while the administration of antiviral drugs is uncommon (Hartmann, 2006, Sellon and Hartmann, 2006, Dunham and Graham, 2008). Most of the antivirals used for feline retrovirosis are the same as used in human medicine, including AZT (zidovudine), ribavirin, zalcitabine and foscarnet, singularly or in combination. The use of these drugs in cats has several disadvantages: doses and protocols are not well established, and they can be toxic for animals as well as producing secondary effects (Caney, 2005, Hartmann, 2006, Sellon and Hartmann, 2006, Dunham and Graham, 2008). As these infections are accompanied by a wide array of clinical signs (anemia, gingivitis, anorexia, secondary respiratory infections, tumors, etc.), there is no preferred curative treatment. Thus, a reasonable alternative for treatment is the use of immunomodulators, particularly type-I interferons that have an additional antiviral effect. The aim of the present work was both to review the literature on the possibility of using interferon-omega (IFN-\u03c9) for treating feline retrovirosis, and to describe the results of a preliminary study conducted on 11 cats infected either by FeLV or FIV, observing clinical, biopathological and virological effects.",

            "text": "Innate immunity plays a role in protection against retroviral infections (Lehner et al., 2008), and includes both intracellular innate antiviral factors, and extracellular factors, particularly interferon. Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines with important multiple biological functions. Interferons are classified into type-I and type-II IFNs (Pestka et al., 2004). Type-I IFNs are produced by virus-infected cells and have non-specific antiviral activity on adjacent non-infected cells. Thus, they are known as \u201cviral IFNs\u201d and are associated with innate immunity. These interferons include IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03c9, among others. Each them has a general mechanism of action based on interaction with specific cell surface receptors and the subsequent induction of expression of interferon-stimulated genes (Sen, 2001, Pestka et al., 2004). These cytokines also induce anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory responses, and therefore, can also participate in adaptive immune responses (Gerlach et al., 2006, Gerlach et al., 2009). Thus the administration of type-I IFN has been proposed as a treatment for several viral diseases as immunomodulatory therapy (Truyen et al., 2002, Collado et al., 2006). These products have been used empirically and quite successfully in feline medicine, without a profound knowledge of their molecular mechanisms.",

Even though clinical improvement and lengthening of the life expectancy of infected cats was observed, several disadvantages soon became apparent, such as: its activity in vivo may be lower than expected as cytokine activity is often species-restricted (it would have less effect on feline cells than on human cells); when injected, the higher doses (100,000 U/kg/day) that are able to induce adequate serum levels may lead to the development of specific neutralizing antibodies that block the active ingredient (Zeidner et al., 1990, M\u00fcller, 2002) and may have adverse effects (Caney, 2005).",

Like other type-I IFNs, IFN-\u03c9 has species-restricted biological activity in vitro. It is able to bind to the same type-I IFN receptor complex as other type-I IFNs and therefore exerts similar antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects (Adolf, 1995).

Its amino acid sequence consists of 170 amino acid residues and an N-glycosylation site at amino acid position 79. This recombinant IFN has been characterized as omega on the basis of its amino acid identity and the processing pattern of the N-terminal sequence (Ueda et al., 1993a, Adolf, 1995). It has a proven antiviral effect, both in vitro (Mochizuki et al., 1994, Truyen et al., 2002, Ohe et al., 2008) and in vivo against canine and feline parvovirus, herpesvirus, calicivirus, coronavirus and rotavirus (Truyen et al., 2002, De Mari et al., 2004, Ishida et al., 2004, Paltrinieri et al., 2007). In addition, the pharmacokinetic properties of rFeIFN-\u03c9 are comparable to those of human interferons in that it does not have a residual accumulation in the body (Ueda et al., 1993b). It has been licensed for use in veterinary medicine (Virbagen\u00ae, Virbac) in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico, although there are few clinical studies that support its use, and its in vivo molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In general, an improvement in clinical signs has been described, justifying its use in infections in which other treatments are not fully effective, such as retroviral diseases.",

Their results have indicated that, as with other retroviruses, rFeIFN-\u03c9 affects the FeLV cycle at the post-transcriptional level, as protein synthesis was not altered, while RT activity (used to estimate the number of infectious particles) decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Given its IC50, rFeIFN-\u03c9 appeared to be around 50\u201390 times more potent than reHuIFN-\u03b1(2a) in inhibiting RT. In addition, the study revealed that IFNs induced a decrease in the viability of FeLV-infected cells, enhancing apoptosis in infected cells that were treated. The significance of this effect on cell viability and its in vivo impact is, at present, unknown.",

In initial experiments, rHuIFN-\u03b1 was injected into FeLV-infected cats, singularly or in combination with AZT (Hoover et al., 1990, Zeidner et al., 1990), and viral antigenic load (antigenemia) was observed to decrease. However, this beneficial response had a limited duration as cats developed antibodies against human IFN (Zeidner et al., 1990). To reduce the development of antibodies, lower doses of IFN were administered orally (1\u201310 IU/kg body weight), resulting in longer survival rates during some studies, with clinical and analytical improvement noted (Steed, 1987, Cummins et al., 1988, Weiss et al., 1991); in others although there was no improvement (McCaw et al., 2001). Similarly, oral treatment of clinically sick FIV-infected cats with low doses of natural HuIFN-\u03b1 resulted in an extended survival period and improved clinical signs (Pedretti et al., 2006). In spite of the clinical benefits of HuIFN-\u03b1 treatment, FeLV- and FIV-infected cats became persistently viremic or had a reduced viral replication only during the treatment period (McCaw et al., 2001, Pedretti et al., 2006).",

Presently, it is the only interferon that the European Medicine Agency (http://emea.europa.eu) has registered in Europe for feline medicine. It has been approved for the treatment of parvovirosis in dogs from one month of age, and FeLV and/or FIV infections in non-terminal cats from the age of 9 weeks (http://emea.europa.eu). Yet very few studies have analyzed the effect of rFeIFN-\u03c9 in naturally-infected cats with FeLV and/or FIV. One of the most extensive studies undertaken evaluated this interferon in a multicentric, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in FeLV-infected or FeLV/FIV co-infected cats with associated clinical signs (De Mari et al., 2004). Cats were treated subcutaneously with rFeIFN-\u03c9 (106\n U/kg/day) daily for five consecutive days in three series (day 0, 14, 60). An improvement in clinical signs and decrease in the mortality rate was observed after treatment as compared to control animals. There was also an increase in the leukogram and in the RBC count in anemic cats (De Mari et al., 2004). However, as no virological (viremia or proviral loads) or immunological (such as CD4/CD8 ratio) parameters were measured throughout the study, it is difficult to conclude whether or not these effects were due to its immunomodulatory or antiviral activities. Since IFN-\u03c9 has biological properties similar to IFN-\u03b1, it is possible that the clinical benefits observed in treated cats corresponded to the activation of their innate immune system for an improved control of environmental pathogens, as compared with an improvement in their viremic state. Further studies are necessary in order to discover answers to these questions.",

Cats may have one or more clinical signs, or may be totally asymptomatic. Practitioners may not know the immune status of the animal, its CD4/CD8 ratio or the proviral load. Thus, treatment with rFeIFN-\u03c9 may produce different results than expected, ranging from no visible effects to an apparent clinical improvement. A big concern for the clinical veterinarian is whether this improvement correlates with a true improvement of the infection, i.e., a decrease in viremia or the proviral load of the cat, or whether the infection may revert when treatment of rFeIFN-\u03c9 is suspended. Treatment is also hampered by the cost of the product. The company recommends three cycles of treatment for five consecutive days, on days 0, 14 and 60. As there is usually clinical improvement, oftentimes, owners consider that the cat has been cured, and suspend treatment before its completion. Another issue for practitioners is deciding when treatment should be repeated, when no analytical values are available. For these reasons, we undertook a preliminary study on the use of rFeIFN-\u03c9 in randomly selected household cats that were brought to the Complutense University Veterinary Clinic Hospital of Madrid, Spain.",

They were treated for eight weeks with commercial rFeIFN-\u03c9 (Virbagen\u00ae, Virbac, France) following the protocol suggested by De Mari et al. (2004). Ten other cats (five FeLV+ and five FIV+), eight of them female, and housed in a cattery, were left untreated and used as controls. The date of infection was unknown in all cases; presumably, the cats were in different stages of the disease, since they included three asymptomatic FIV+ cats, and ten cats (4 FeLV+ and 6 FIV+) with six or more different retrovirus-associated clinical signs (RACS) of various degrees of severity (clinical score \u22656, severe disease). The most frequent disorders were anorexia, apathy, pallor and oral lesions. Blood samples were taken before the beginning of treatment (V1), and two weeks after completion (V2), with equivalent sampling dates in untreated cats. Three treated cats were brought for follow-up examination until month 12 (V3). Blood sampling, hemogram, leukogram, biochemical profile, electrophoretogram, and CD4/CD8 determination were conducted as described previously (Miro et al., 2007). FeLV p27 and FIV p24 proteins were evaluated using commercial Petchek kits developed by Idexx (Westbrook, ME, USA), and RT activity was measured with kits provided by Cavidi Tech (Uppsala, Sweden). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted using the procedures described by Pinches et al. (2007) and Leutenegger et al. (1999). Results were statistically analyzed using Statgraphics.

In a murine model with the Friend murine leukemia retrovirus, the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-\u03b1 seemed to be more important than the antiviral effect through the induction of antiviral enzymes (Gerlach et al., 2009). In our preliminary study, rFeIFN-\u03c9 induced an evident improvement of the clinical condition of treated cats, as well as of the hemogram parameters. The CD4/CD8 ratio improvement was inconsistent, and the virological parameters, such as proviral load and viremia were not seen to be affected by treatment. This suggests that rFeIFN-\u03c9 possibly lacks antiviral effects in vivo, but rather may have an immunomodulatory effect. Taking these results into consideration, it would seem advisable to treat retrovirus-infected cats with interferon when they have clinical signs, as they would benefit from its effects in improving their clinical condition.",
