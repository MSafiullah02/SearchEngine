The intensity of the recession and the implications on employment has further intensified this polarization by massively destroying medium-paid jobs in manufacturing and construction. At the same time, educational and skills profiles in the emerging employment structure tend to become more demanding, thus compromising the chances of re-employment and access to well-paid jobs for the lower-skilled unemployed.",

An innovative integrated approach, developed in Maastricht, included enhanced means to identify the offenders, education programs to improve their potential skills, and an antigraffiti bus with formerly unemployed people specialized in removing graffiti. The city made a wall available to all citizens wishing to express themselves through the art of graffiti. The project proved very successful and led to the dramatic decrease of the graffiti in Maastricht. It also had a noticeable effect on preventing recidivism. Moreover, former offenders trained in graffiti techniques have become creative artists.",

Children\u2019s use of space and time has changed in the last few decades. Inhabiting a shrinking space, spending more time indoors, a feature also favored by the increasing availability of home entertainment, can have a high impact on future lives. The quality of the home environment and surrounding outdoor space is therefore of vital importance to children\u2019s well-being (OECD 2009b).",
