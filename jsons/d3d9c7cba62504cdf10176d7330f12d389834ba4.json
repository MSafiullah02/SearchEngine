This fi nding, along with the clinical and laboratory fi ndings, suggests the possibility of a pancreatic fi stula. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP, c ) demonstrates extravasation of the contrast media from the pancreatic duct in the proximal body of the pancreas ( arrows ) confi rming the presence of a pancreatic fi stula. A stent ( d ) was placed successfully under endoscopy guidance to bypass the disrupted pancreatic duct ( arrow ). Axial ( e , f ) images of a CECT performed 1 week later demonstrate a decrease in the amount of intraperitoneal fl uid and a pancreatic stent in the main duct ( arrows ). Note the interval increase in size of the peripancreatic fl uid collection ( f ) ( arrowheads ). 14.14.6 Venous Thrombosis/Occlusion \u2022 Venous thrombosis or occlusion is not a rare condition in acute pancreatitis.-These complications are more common in: \u25cb Alcohol induced, necrotizing, and chronic pancreatitis -Venous structures most commonly involved (in order of frequency: separately or in combination): \u25cb Splenic vein \u25cb Portal vein \u25cb Superior mesenteric veinPathogenesis\u2022 Stasis, spasm, mass effect from surrounding pancreatic infl ammation, and direct damage of the venous wall by liberated enzymes",
