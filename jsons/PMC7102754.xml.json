On the other hand, smaller percentages of them knew that ZIKV can be transmitted through blood-borne (30.3%) and sexual (17.1%) transmission. Regarding the severity of symptoms, only 13.1% of the participants correctly recognized that adult ZIKV infection usually presents as a mild disease. Furthermore, about one-fifth of them knew the commonest symptoms of ZIKV. Microcephaly as the most dangerous complication of ZIKV among the infected newborns was not recognized by about two-thirds of the participants. Similarly, four-fifths of them did not recognize that blood sample is needed for the laboratory viral isolation of ZIKV. The table also reveals that less than one-half of the respondents knew that reduction of exposure to mosquito bites is one of the important preventive measure for reducing Zika transmission in the endemic counties. A large proportion of the participants (79.3%) correctly identified that ZIKV could be transmitted to Saudi Arabia. However, only about one-third of them recognized the reasons behind such possibility (KSA contains the Aedes vector and hosts the largest annual mass gathering). A similar percentage recognized that DFV is another similar arbovirus endemic in the KSA. Furthermore, few students correctly recognized the unavailability of a licensed ZIKV vaccine, at the time of study. Similarly, a scattered percentage (8%) recognized that fluid replacement therapy is the most important treatment of ZIKV cases. The table also shows that 39.7% of the participants correctly identified that Ebola is the most dangerous emerging diseases found in the West Africa. While, 56.3% of them identified that MERS as the most dangerous one in the KSA.",

This finding agrees with the results of Gupta et al. who conducted a similar study among dental practitioners from India [21].

Better results were reported from the Indian study [21]. The cause of this discrepancy between both studies may be because the Indian study was done among practitioners (with more knowledge) and not among medical students. However, much better knowledge was obtained from a study performed among attendees of Zika symposium in 4 cities of Colombia from June to July, 2015. After the symposium, all participants identified the correct answer regarding mosquito bite transmission of ZIKV, and almost all of them correctly identified the incubation period [23]. The cause behind such dissimilarities may be because the study of Colombia was done among participants who attended Zika symposium, or may be because the cities of Colombia are endemic in Dengue and Chikungunya fevers which resemble ZIKV, or due to the starting Zika epidemic in the Latin American countries at the time of conduction of their study. Another cross-sectional study done in Pereira and Cartagena cities of Colombia, 2016, showed that most of their respondents (97% and 92.5% in both cities) correctly identified the routes of ZIKV transmission [22]. The cause of their high level of knowledge may be due to extensive spread of ZIKV epidemic during 2016 in the most of the Latin American countries, including Colombia. In such countries, many educational programs were done about ZIKV and this results in increasing their knowledge about it.",

On the other hand, those who attended training programs about ZIKV had significantly better ZIKV knowledge compared to others. A high percentage of the participants identified that ZIKV can spread to Saudi Arabia, while a smaller percentage knew the causes behind this. Regarding the attitudes, most of the participants agreed that there are no adequate measures for preventing ZIKV. Multifaceted approaches are needed to increase awareness of medical students about ZIKV and other emerging diseases. These approaches can be extended to include also the medical practitioners and the community in general. Development of interactive courses on emerging diseases and travel epidemiology is needed for undergraduate medical curricula. Facilitation of medical students\u2019 volunteer working in preparedness of important emerging diseases with Ministry of Health and other volunteering bodies is required. Similar studies about ZIKV, and other emerging diseases are recommended to be done among medical practitioners and other target populations. Furthermore, the findings of the current study point out the need for creating international and national programs for addressing the important emerging public health concerns of the nations, especially in the emergence of ZIKV and its complications as microcephaly, GBS and other complications.",
