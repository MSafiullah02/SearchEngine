Furthermore, viruses can encode their own miRNAs, trigger changes in cellular miRNA expression or encode RNA silencing suppressor factors that inhibit cellular miRNAs.

Endo-siRNAs and piRNAs are primarily involved in the repression of transposons, whereas miRNAs regulate cellular gene expression (4) . In recent years, miRNA-mediated gene regulation has received much attention.

After virus entry and start of replication the virus can induce (+) or inhibit (\u2212) the expression of certain cellular miRNAs. These may influence signalling pathways and stress responses. Virus-encoded RSS factors may block specific RNAi actions. RSS factors like influenza virus NS1, Ebola virus VP35, and HIV-1 Tat can bind and sequester small RNAs/pre-miRNAs, whereas the adenovirus VA RNAs inhibit miRNA processing by saturating the miRNA pathway. Some viruses may depend on constitutively expressed miRNAs (HCV-miR-122). Increased expression of cellular miRNAs that target the viral RNA will result in inhibition of viral gene expression and decreased miRNA expression may increase virus replication. Changes in the miRNA profile may also affect cellular gene expression that may either stimulate or inhibit viral gene expression. base paired hairpin structures. In the nucleus the RNA hairpin structure is excised by the RNAse III-like enzyme Drosha and its co-factor DGCR8 to form the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which represents an imperfect hairpin structure (16) . There is a separate miRNA pathway that is independent of Drosha processing. In this pathway, introns containing the hairpin are termed mirtrons, which are spliced into pre-miRNA hairpins that access the miRNA pathway. First described in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, these mirtrons have recently also been reported in mammals (17) . Both Drosha and the mirtron pathway generate an excised hairpin of approximately 60 nucleotides, the pre-miRNA. This pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm by the nuclear RNA export factor Exportin 5 (Exp5), where it is further processed by the RNAse III-like enzyme Dicer in association with its co-factors TAR binding protein (TRBP) and PACT (18, 19) . The Dicer-TRBP-PACT complex cleaves off the terminal loop resulting in the miRNA duplex with a two-nucleotide 3\u00a2 overhang on either side. Depending on the structure, miRNAs associate with one of the four Argonaute proteins to form the functional miRNA-loaded RISC complex. In D. melanogaster miRNAs with mismatches within the central part of the duplex are preferentially incorporated into AGO1. The miRNAs with more perfect duplexes associate with AGO2, which is the only member of the Argonaute protein family with slicing activity. Similar sorting mechanisms are conserved in C. elegans and mammals (20) . Once loaded into RISC, the miRNA duplex is unwound into a guide strand and a complementary passenger strand that is subsequently degraded. RISC programmed by the guide miRNA subsequently targets mRNAs with complementary sequences within the 3\u00a2UTR. Pairing of the 5\u00a2 7-8 nucleotides of the miRNA (seed region) to multiple sites within the 3\u00a2UTR of an mRNA is important for target recognition and translational inhibition (21) . The targeted RNAs are translocated to cellular processing (P)-bodies where they are stored or de-adenylated, de-capped, and subsequently degraded (22) . It was initially thought that miRNA targeting could result in cleavage of the mRNA target, but only in rare cases. However, at the recent 2010 Keystone meeting it was reported that, in contrast to general belief, miR-NAs do frequently induce RNA destabilization instead of translational inhibition.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 158, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1402, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1744, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2091, "end": 2095, "text": "(18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2099, "text": "19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2704, "end": 2708, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3131, "end": 3135, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3284, "end": 3288, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Unlike miRNAs, siRNAs are perfectly complementary duplexes of 21 nucleotides that originate from dsRNA precursors upon processing by Dicer.

Plant and insect viruses counter this RNA-based antiviral response through the production of specific RSS factors (23, 24) . In mammals, perfectly base paired long dsRNAs trigger the interferon (IFN) response that signals cells to induce the innate antiviral IFN response, which involves the induction of many different genes (25) . Despite serious attempts, virus-specific siRNAs have not been detected in virus-infected mammalian cells via conventional cloning and sequencing techniques (10, 26) . Because mammals have the IFN response and virus-specific siRNAs could not be detected, there was little support for an antiviral function of RNAi in mammals.

The first reported example of a cellular miRNA that targets a viral RNA genome is miR-32. This miRNA targets the retrovirus PFV-1 in a genome region that is present in the 3\u00a2UTR of all viral transcripts and open reading frame 2 that encodes both the viral Bet and EnvBet proteins.

Interestingly, only HSV-1 displayed increased virus production, suggesting that Dicer-mediated antiviral RNAi responses do not represent a general antiviral mechanism in mammals.

Certain nucleotide changes in the viral genome sequence will not be tolerated because they create more optimal miRNA target sequences that trigger repression by the miRNA machinery. This evolutionary pressure is illustrated by the observation that the artificial insertion of fully complementary miRNA target sites in viral genes results in severe attenuation of virus replication (36) . This fine-tuning of the viral RNA to the miRNA composition of the host cell may also restrict the viral ability to adjust to a change in the environment, such as the invasion of a new host organism upon zoonotic transmission or the intra-host pressure when the immune system is induced. In addition to PFV-1 and VSV, cellular miRNAs have also been shown to target the RNA genome of HIV-1 and HCV. Because of the complex interaction of these viruses with miRNAs, these cases will be discussed separately. Huang et al. were the first to show that cellular miRNAs can target and potently repress HIV-1 gene expression (32) . HIV-1 is a member of the lentivirus genus within the family of retroviruses. Its genome is encoded by a positive-stranded RNA molecule of 9.8 kb that is reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA that integrates into the host cell genome. HIV-1 replicates in CD4positive T cells and thus causes a direct attack on the immune system, which when left untreated will eventually result in the development of AIDS. It was shown that miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-223, and miR-382 are able to target sequences near the 3\u00a2 end of all HIV-1 transcripts and suppress the expression of viral mRNAs in resting CD4 + T cells. The expression of this set of miRNAs is reduced in activated CD4 + T cells, thus allowing active virus replication. This finding suggests that miRNAs play a role in the establishment of viral latency. HIV-1 latency occurs in resting CD4 + T cells when the HIV-1 provirus is stably integrated into the host genome without producing new viral transcripts and proteins. HIV-1 latency may allow the virus to escape from the immune system and latency is a major problem in attempts to eradicate the virus in a patient by therapeutic intervention. The latency-inducing miRNAs also appear to determine the susceptibility of peripheral blood monocytes for HIV-1 infection (37) . These cells express all the essential receptors for HIV-1 entry, but become infrequently infected. New findings suggest that miRNA-mediated suppression protects the cells against productive HIV-1 infection. In other words, the cellular miRNAs form one of the determinants of the viral tropism for certain cell types. Several miRNAs including miR-29a were also predicted to target the HIV-1 RNA genome (38) . The miR-29a recognizes a target within the viral nef gene to restrict expression of the Nef protein and overall virus replication (39). Nathans et al. subsequently showed that HIV-1 mRNAs that are targeted and inhibited by miR-29a are loaded into RISCs that associate with P bodies (40) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 583, "end": 587, "text": "(36)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1209, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2493, "end": 2497, "text": "(37)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2901, "end": 2905, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3190, "end": 3194, "text": "(40)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cellular miRNAs Targeting Viral Sequences"}, {"text": "Not all cellular miRNAs that target viral mRNAs have a negative effect on gene expression and viral replication.

Bennasser et al. were the first to show Tat-mediated RSS suppression in luciferase-based reporter assay (64) .

We could confirm these results using an HIV-1 variant that is independent of Tatmediated transcription activation (63) . Only Tat mutants or heterologous factors that exhibit RSS activity could restore virus production of a mutant virus lacking Tat RSS activity. Another study showed that the HIV-1 Tat RSS function can be functionally replaced by the RSS protein P19 of tomato bushy stunt virus and that the Tat protein exhibits RSS activity in Nicotiana Benthamiana protoplasts (65) . We also showed that the RSS protein NS3 of rice hoja blanca virus (RHBV), a plant virus, is able to complement the RSS function of HIV-1 Tat (70) . The NS3 protein of RHBV is an RSS that exclusively binds small dsRNA molecules such as miRNAs and siRNAs. An NS3 mutant that is deficient in dsRNA binding and RSS activity is unable to rescue production of the Tat-negative HIV-1 variant.

Previously, these RNAs were shown to block antiviral PKR activity (71) . The structured nature of the VA molecules shows similarity with pre-miRNAs, raising the possibility that the VA RNAs are Dicer substrates. It was demonstrated that the VA RNAs are recognized and processed by Dicer into virus-derived si/miRNAs that are functionally incorporated into RISC (72) (73) (74) (75) (76) . Because of their extremely high expression level of up to 1 \u00d7 10 8 copies per cell, the VA RNAs cause saturation of the RNAi pathway.

The double function of many viral RSS/IFN-antagonistic proteins is perhaps not that surprising considering that both the RNAi and IFN pathways are induced by the same virus-derived molecule, dsRNA.

The newly discovered interactions between cellular miRNAs and pathogenic viruses likewise provide new possibilities for antiviral drug design. In fact, the therapeutic use of such miRNA co-factors is similar in concept to antiviral silencing of protein co-factors that are required for virus replication. Targeting of the set of cellular miRNAs that have been implicated in HIV-1 latency has been suggested as a strategy to block or reduce HIV-1 latency (32, 86) . HIV-1 latency poses a serious problem for the treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals with antiviral drugs. Antiviral drugs can strongly reduce the level of replicating virus, but HIV-1 will rapidly re-emerge from the latent reservoir after stopping therapy.

In this strategy, the inserted targets are usually fully complementary to the cellular miRNAs, thus resulting in cleavage of the viral/vector RNA.

Overview of the interactions between the cellular RNAi mechanism and an invading virus. After virus entry and start of replication the virus can induce (+) or inhibit (\u2212) the expression of certain cellular miRNAs. These may influence signalling pathways and stress responses. Virus-encoded RSS factors may block specific RNAi actions. RSS factors like influenza virus NS1, Ebola virus VP35, and HIV-1 Tat can bind and sequester small RNAs/pre-miRNAs, whereas the adenovirus VA RNAs inhibit miRNA processing by saturating the miRNA pathway. Some viruses may depend on constitutively expressed miRNAs (HCV-miR-122). Increased expression of cellular miRNAs that target the viral RNA will result in inhibition of viral gene expression and decreased miRNA expression may increase virus replication. Changes in the miRNA profile may also affect cellular gene expression that may either stimulate or inhibit viral gene expression.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Cellular miRNAs targeting viral genes", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Virus </td><td>miRNA </td><td>Target </td><td>Effect </td><td>References\n</td></tr><tr><td>HIV-1 </td><td>miR-28, miR-125b, </td><td>TAR, Env, NF-\u2022b, </td><td>Induces viral latency </td><td>(32, 37)\n</td></tr><tr><td>miR-382, miR-150, </td><td>Env, Nef\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>PFV-1 </td><td>miR-223\nmiR-29a </td><td>Nef </td><td>Inhibits translation/ replication\n</td><td>(39, 40)\n</td></tr><tr><td>miR-32 </td><td>Bet and EnvBet </td><td>Inhibits translation/ replication (Tas protein counters this effect)\n</td><td>(33)\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>proteins, 3\u2022UTR\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>VSV </td><td>miR-24, miR-93 </td><td>L and P protein </td><td>Inhibits translation/ replication\n</td><td>(34)\n</td></tr><tr><td>HCV </td><td>miR-122 </td><td>5\u2022UTR (IRES) </td><td>Stimulates translation/ replication (liver specific)\n</td><td>(42)\n</td></tr><tr><td>miR-1, miR-30, miR-128, </td><td>C, NS5A (others not specified)\n</td><td>Inhibits translation/ replication (induced by </td><td>(35)\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>miR-196, miR-296, </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>miR-351, miR-431, </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>IFN signalling)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>miR-448\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>miR-199a </td><td>5\u2022UTR (IRES) </td><td>Inhibits translation/ replication\n</td><td>(96)\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "RNAi research in the Berkhout lab is sponsored by ZonMw (Vici grant and Translational Gene Therapy program), NWO-CW (Top grant), the European Union (LSHP-CT-2006-037301) and the Technology Foundation STW (grant AGT.7708).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Acknowledgements"}]}
