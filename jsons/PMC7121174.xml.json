Therefore, laboratory diagnostics of influenza viruses are based on the confirmation of the presence of A and B influenza viruses (Brydak 2012). The main symptoms of influenza infection are sudden onset of disease, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, headache, and general malaise. The course of influenza infection in children is further characterized by symptoms from the gastrointestinal tract. It is worth noting that the symptoms above mentioned are not specific to influenza infection, but also for infections caused by other respiratory viruses (influenza-like viruses), which makes the diagnosis difficult (WHO 2014).",

The results also confirm the frequent presence of influenza and influenza-like viruses in children aged 0\u201314 years. In addition, in the youngest age-group of 0\u20134 years, the presence of also virus type B was confirmed, which shows that young children have a poorly developed immune system, making them more vulnerable to disease. Large gatherings of people contribute to influenza infections. Children due to daily stays in kindergartens and schools are particularly susceptible to infection and also are carriers of infection (Hallmann-Szeli\u0144ska et al. 2015, 2016).

Unfortunately, few parents undertake a decision to vaccinate their children, which in case of infection may end up with life-threatening complications. The same holds true for vaccination of pregnant women, which actually provides immunization for both mother and child. A confirmed case of influenza in a 14-day old child we observed in the present study pointedly shows that the mother was not vaccinated during pregnancy, although such vaccinations are recommended in Poland in the Preventive Vaccination Plan.",

Children are a special segment of population that has a substantial impact on the spread of influenza virus. Therefore, a need for influenza vaccination in children should not be underestimated.",
