Most significant comorbidities were previous rectal cancer, treated by Hartman resection and left terminal colostomy confection, post-incisional hernia of the abdominal midline and chronic kidney failure with left kidney shrinkage. Although no respiratory symptom such as dyspnea, cough or fever was reported, the routine chest X-ray performed at the admittance showed a consolidation pattern spreading at the inferior lobes of the lungs (fig.1\n) and the nasal swab turned positive for NCoV (lab tests are reported in table 1\n). A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) was performed, showing a free rupture of the pararenal abdominal aorta, right above the previous endograft at the level of the renal arteries, and a massive intraperitoneal hematoma (figg.2,3). Open surgical treatment was excluded, not only due to the technical difficulty caused by a hostile abdomen and the need to explant the endograft, but also because a laparotomy would have necessarily worsened the respiratory impairment and probably yielded to a severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Endovascular repair was therefore chosen, although the emergent setting left no time to purchase the most suitable devices and the repair had to be carried out with the stocks available in the hospital warehouse.",

Introducers Cook\u00ae 8x45mm and Cook\u00ae 7x45mm (Cook Medical Inc, Bloomington, Indiana, US) were placed in the left and right CFA respectively. The right renal artery was engaged from the left access with a 6F catheter. On the right side, the introducer was switched with a Gore\u00ae 18F introducer (Gore & Ass, Flagstaff, Arizona, US) and an angiogram was performed, showing aortic rupture right above the left renal artery (LRA), which was barely visible (fig.4\n). Due to the shrinkage of the left kidney, it was decided that the left renal artery could be sacrificed and only the right renal artery (RRA) was revascularized. On a guide wire V18, two Viabhan\u00ae 7x50mm and 8x100mm (Gore & Ass, Flagstaff, Arizona, US) were placed in the RRA. A Gore\u00ae aortic cuff sized 32x45 mm was placed right below the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and deployed with intentional covering of the LRA. The two Viabahn\u00ae (periscope technique) were then deployed and they were post-dilated simultaneously with the cuff (Cordis Opta Pro\u00ae 7x100, Cordis Corp., Milpitas, CA, US, was used for the stentgrafts and Reliant\u00ae, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, for the cuff). At the completion angiogram, complete exclusion of the aneurysm was observed, with patency of the SMA and RRA (fig.5\n). The patient was extubated at the awakening and showed quick recovery of the vital parameters (BP: 105/60 mmHg).",

The patient was actually asymptomatic for respiratory infection, but the imaging and lab tests showed clear signs of a moderate-to-severe involvement of the pulmonary area and initial signs of systemic involvement. Although no specific indication has been given yet about the management of COVID-19 patients warranting urgent aortic surgery, the consequences of laparotomy on the respiratory system are well known, especially in already compromised patients, and so is the great advantage of EVAR over open aortic surgery in terms of pulmonary involvement4; therefore the advanced endovascular treatment was the most reasonable choice, even in absence of a wide selection of endovascular materials covering all possible sizes. Parallel grafting has already been described in semi-urgent, urgent and even emergent settings, with satisfactory outcomes, including lower mortality and lower complication rate and shorter Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, and its role can result even more precious now, in order to avoid open surgery in COVID-19 patients.3 In this respect, the importance of having a wide variety of endovascular devices stored in the hospital warehouse is crucial, since it offers the possibility to treat safely many and different types of aortic diseases and anatomic configurations, not only in urgency, but also in elective settings, since supplies could be delayed due to the lockdown and other measures to contain the viral spread.",

            "text": "In the present case, a longer proximal neck could have been obtained by performing a chimney graft on the SMA from the beginning, which would have spared the patients the second intervention, but the emergent conditions of the patients (hemorrhagic shock with hemodynamic instability) made it preferable to try for a quicker and less invasive treatment. That was in fact successful in excluding the aneurysm and stop the intraperitoneal hemorrhage, as demonstrated by the hemodynamic stabilization and the CTA, and made it possible to perform the reintervention on a stable patient, in non-emergent setting. Although EVAR is at high risk for late failure and complications, and despite being technically demanding due to the parallel grafting, endovascular repair appears in those cases the treatment of choice, because it represents the safest and quickest way to stop the hemorrhage preserving the respiratory function. In fact, not only did the patient regain his consciousness and hemodynamic stability shortly after the end of the procedure, but he was also extubated and has had no further need for ventilatory support so far. Moreover, endovascular repair avoided post-operative ICU stay, which would have been necessary in case of open repair, in a moment of dramatic shortage of beds due to the critically ill COVID-19 patients. The outbreak of COVID-19 in Northern Italy, in fact, has imposed the conversion of many hospitals, including ours, in COVID-19 dedicated centers, with only little resources available for the management of other urgencies. Theoretically, non-COVID urgencies should be referred to other centers, but often these patients cannot be safely transferred, so it is of the utmost importance to have a protocol for all those cases requiring non-deferrable treatment. The one followed in our Center consists in early screening for COVID-19 through nasal swab and chest X-ray for all patients accessing to the Emergency Room (ER), and separate routes for in-hospital admission for COVID and non-COVID patients. The operatory theaters and the hospital wards are also divided between COVID-free and COVID-19 patients. If COVID-19 positivity cannot be determined before admission and surgery, the patients is managed through the \u201cclean\u201d route, but with all precaution of staff individual protection and room sanification that are employed for COVID-patients. In the present case, the result of the nasal swab was only available after the first intervention began, but the patient was considered COVID-19 positive since the beginning based on the chest X-ray. All these considerations are crucial to contain the viral spread among in-hospital patients and were extremely helpful in choosing the most suitable approach of treatment.",
