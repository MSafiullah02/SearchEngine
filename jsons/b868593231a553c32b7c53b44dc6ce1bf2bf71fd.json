In months, despite various containment strategies, the virus had spread worldwide with almost 900,000 documented cases and over 45,000 deaths in approximately 200 countries and territories as of April 2, 2020. 1 In the United States, despite a Society of Critical Care Medicine estimate of nearly 200,000 full-featured and basic-function ventilators, many hospital systems are already depleted of their ventilator supply. [2] [3] [4] Though traditionally non-medical companies have offered to manufacture functional ventilators, scaling production and delivery is unlikely to be rapid enough to meet surge capacity requirements predicted in as little as one week by Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimations, drawing significant inquiry and criticism for splitting one ventilator amongst multiple patients, or \"multi-ventilation.\" 4, 5 Despite the joint statement from the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Association for Respiratory Care recommending against splitting ventilators, 6 Surgeon General Jerome Adams and Assistant Secretary for Health Administration Brett Giroir stated multi-ventilation may be performed, but only as a last resort. 7,8 Multiple studies have been conducted on simulation lungs or animals, but none attempted to simultaneously individualize tidal volume and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in lungs of varying compliancesmainstays of treatment therapy in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 9-13 Our findings suggest that multiple patients of different compliances can be successfully ventilated from a single source with individually tailored tidal volumes and PEEP. To our knowledge, this is the first journal publication to demonstrate this.",

However, when set in pressure control mode, we successfully converted one ventilator into two.

In the first scenario, two \"patient\" lungs of identical compliance are subjected to identical ventilation parameters on pressure control, yielding qualitatively even distribution of total tidal volume. In the second scenario, lungs of different compliance experience different inspiratory pressures and PEEP, yielding independently controlled tidal volumes.
