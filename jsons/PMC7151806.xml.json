However, this insight has only recently returned to geography after a long conceptual slumber in the seductive embrace of mathematical description. Mathematical approaches enabled a complex description of either social or spatial processes, but little theorization, and as David Harvey noted, no strategy at the interface between the spatial and the social. Geography's significant role in articulating of a concept of society and space, and the discipline's part in a larger spatial turn in social theory can best be appreciated through a brief historical detour.",

Urban life, they theorized, became blended and compressed, a locus where anonymity encouraged nonconformity in thought.

Space was not merely a productive component of contemporary capitalism; capitalism was now produced, itself, by space. Working along multiple trajectories Lefebvre charted the geohistory of spaces. This he traced from the world of early human history organized primarily through natural spaces (in which natural features were discovered and exploited), to contemporary abstract spaces, wherein distinctions between places in the globe were erased and nature was subordinated to a grid of functions. In this vision, (inspired by Lefebvre's own lifetime experience of the French state's relentless modernization of its countryside), modernity and modernization were not emancipatory conditions, but rather an expression of a commodification tending toward barbarism. Modernization was a means by which capitalism ensured, by stealth, its survival. Social space raised questions about the centrality of class as the sine qua non of social transformation. The city was elevated from its status as a micro expression of larger socioeconomic processes to a central point of intervention. Social space reconceptualized the terrain of struggle: spilling out of the factory and on to the streets.",

Exemplary in this regard is Gillian Rose's Feminism and Geography, and her concept of paradoxical space. Other geographers have extended her perspective to investigate phenomenon of passing. Griselda Pollock, a scholar of the arts, has undertaken a similar reassessment of spaces of modernity through analysis of impressionist paintings. For example, Morisot's On the Balcony, is not viewed by Pollock as a masculinist vision of modernity, but rather a record of a white bourgeois woman's experience of spatialized, gendered difference, marked by the distance between balcony, and street \u2013 semiprivate and public space. While the margin marks a site of exclusion, it is thus understood as a potential site of recuperation and resistance. Hooper and Soja deepen this line of argument, drawing upon bell hooks' insights on the meaning of home for black women. They conceptualize the space that difference makes as a productive, counter-hegemonic project.",

The idea that these spaces operate in the here and now has been forcefully demonstrated in McKittrick's mobilization of paradoxical space in Demonic Grounds. Here she explores the range of micro-geographies that depict American slavery as intimately bound up in the constitution of modernity. For example, the auction block displayed a perverse rationality as a site of measurement of human worth. However, she also argues these spaces can afford possibilities for resistance. Thus a cramped attic space, which functioned for 7 years as a space of extreme confinement for an escaped slave was also a transit point to freedom. This approach invites a deeper exploration of politics through a range of spatialized concepts \u2013 third spaces, passing, transgression, border zones, a politics of location, \u2018between-ness\u2019, center-margin all come under scrutiny.",

The \u2018lines of flight\u2019 or \u2018becomings\u2019 of the subjects are the paths wrought by their perpetual improvisation \u2013 subjects, bodies are not bounded entities, containers, but rather \u2018organizational arrangements\u2019 in a continual state of reaction to their milieu. These improvisations can become channeled into stable recurring relationships, or blocked, diverted, or even overthrown.

This is a Leibnizian rather than Cartesian space: relational, enfolded, understood in terms of interfaces, interconnections, conjunctions, and interpellations.

Power is viewed as manifesting in two distinct forms: potestas \u2013 an alienating form of power which separates its subjects from their own capacities, and tends to be associated with feelings of melancholia and sadness; and potentia \u2013 or an emancipatory power which enhances subject's capacities to act in their best interests, and tends to be associated with feelings of joy.
