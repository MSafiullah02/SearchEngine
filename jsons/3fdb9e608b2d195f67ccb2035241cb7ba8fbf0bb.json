This article highlights some of these discrepancies and argues for a more balanced, scientific approach. In this time of financial restraint, we need to identify true priorities from both health and economic perspectives, and to see what practices can safely and effectively be modified or abandoned.",

Subsets may be either benefited, unaffected or disadvantaged by specific treatments and stratagems, so the net result of a wide population study will often fail to reflect an individual's response.

He observed that adoption of hand hygiene in medical attendants during childbirth reduced mortality rates due to puerperal fever by a factor of 10. While ridiculed at the time, these observations have become regarded as one of the seminal events in the development of modern medicine. Seen in this quasireligious light, and with additional pressure from media shockhorror expos\u00e9s and governmental/insurer threats of 'naming and shaming', financial penalties and senior administrator dismissal and litigation, it is easy to see why a perceived rise in hospital-acquired infection instinctively provokes calls for more assiduous hand disinfection, increased use of barrier precautions and institution of diagnostics and therapies that offer dubious cost-or outcome-benefit. Practices such as the use of gown and gloves, isolation of selected patients and alcohol gel hand sterilization have been rapidly established as standards of care but without specific high-level proof of efficacy. Subsequent efforts at grant funding, formal testing and/or publication may then be impeded by a lack of equipoise, especially when experts who promote the orthodoxy tend to be the 'go-to' reviewers.",

Judging the evidence base for these treatments is complex. For example, is Level 1 evidence from prospective randomized controlled trials required to justify the use of every intervention, or would such a requirement prevent the uptake of many potentially beneficial interventions? Is it ethical to formally test by prospective randomized controlled trial the benefits of interventions long established as standard of care? Even if this were possible, would sufficient equipoise exist? In the absence of such evidence, how valid are findings culled from retrospective database analyses and historical studies that suggest benefit? This is particularly pertinent when the practice and process of critical care has changed dramatically in the last 10 -20 years. Stress ulcer bleeding was a major cause of morbidity and mortality in ICU patients in the early 1970s; now it is a relatively unusual phenomenon regardless of the use (or not) of gastric protectants. The unwanted consequences of the continued (over)use of proton pump inhibitors and H 2 antagonists, e.g. impairment of neutrophil bactericidal activity 5 and Clostridium difficile overgrowth, 6 may no longer be outweighed by their direct therapeutic benefit.

The rationale is that 'patients with severe sepsis or septic shock have little margin for error in the choice of therapy, so the initial selection of antimicrobial therapy should be broad enough to cover all likely pathogens. There is ample evidence that failure to initiate appropriate therapy (i.e., therapy with activity against the pathogen that is subsequently identified as the causative agent) correlates with increased morbidity and mortality'. The most frequently quoted paper 8 in support of this claim was based, like most others, on a retrospective data analysis. The authors of the paper indeed found a strong relationship between delay in effective antimicrobial initiation and in-hospital mortality in patients with septic shock. Appropriate treatment within the first hour of documented hypotension was associated with a survival rate of 79.9%; however, survival decreased by 7.6% for each hour of delay thereafter over the next 6 h. Delay exceeding 36 h increased the risk of death 100-fold with less than 5% surviving. Clearly, these data are surprising given that bacterial culture and susceptibility results are often not available until after 36 h, not infrequently prompting Prowle et al.",

They concluded that 'without adequately designed research studies in this area, there is little evidence for or against recommendations regarding aggressive empiric therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics'.",

However, no variable associated with antibiotic policy was significantly associated with death. If the maximum severity of the bacteraemic illness was removed from the model, effective first-line antibiotic therapy did reduce mortality, but only when started early as empirical treatment (odds ratio 0.58; 95% confidence interval 0.39 -0.87). The benefit would thus appear to be derived from early treatment but only when commenced before the patient becomes critically ill. These data support the conclusion made in an excellent review by Harbarth and colleagues 14 that 'the detrimental effects of inadequate antibiotic therapy seem to become weaker in the most severely ill patients with short life expectancies'. They too were critical of the methodological aspects of reported studies.",

However, this was actually done in 1938 by Evans and Gaisford in Dudley Road Hospital, Birmingham. 15 They compared outcomes in 200 patients with lobar pneumonia (mainly pneumococcal) either treated or not with a sulphonamide. Randomization was performed on the basis of whether or not they, or their colleagues on other wards, managed the patients. The control group received the 'usual routine non-specific treatment', though what this constitutes was not stated. At that time intravenous fluid administration was unusual and positive pressure ventilation had not yet been invented, though facemask oxygen therapy was likely to have been available. Of note, the sulphonamide, given on average for just 5 -7 days, reduced mortality from 27% to 8%. While clearly an impressive effect from the short-term sulphonamide treatment, also striking is the fact that three-quarters survived often-confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia without antibiotics and with minimal other intervention. What the outcomes would have been had intravenous fluid resuscitation, noninvasive or invasive ventilation and other organ support been available must remain speculative. As a challenging reflection on our progress (or lack of), overall mortality rates from pneumococcal pneumonia are no better to this day. For example, a Spanish multicentre study recently reported a 30 day mortality of 15.1%. 16 The mantra must remain that clinicians should strive to administer antibiotics both promptly and effectively to patients with suspected infection, but it is reasonable to question the absolute impact on outcomes.",

It is a sad indictment of the specialties of intensive care, microbiology and infectious diseases, as well as governmental bodies and industry, that after 40 years or more of critical care we still do not know the optimal duration of a course of antibiotics for a 'standard' infection. Clearly, deep-seated infections such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis warrant a prolonged antibiotic course but, even in these cases, the chosen duration is largely empirical.

Prospective randomized controlled trials (PRCTs) are few and far between. Chastre et al. 18 did show that comparable clinical effectiveness was achieved with 8 day or 15 day treatment regimens for ventilator-associated pneumonia, but there was a significant reduction in the emergence of multiresistant pathogens in those receiving the shorter course. Two recently published PRCTs have used the pro-inflammatory blood marker procalcitonin to guide discontinuation of antibiotics. The multicentre PRORATA trial, 19 performed in 321 patients in eight French ICUs, showed a reduction in antibiotic course duration from 14.3+9.1 days to 11.6+8.2 days (P,0.0001) with no change in mortality. The predominant type of infection treated was of the respiratory tract and nearly half the patients had septic shock. Similar patients were treated and similar outcomes were achieved by Nobre et al. 20 in a single-centre trial from Geneva; they, however, showed a median reduction in antibiotic use from 9.5 days to 6 days (P\u00bc 0.15). A reasonable argument can be made that ongoing inflammation is not a direct surrogate of ongoing bacterial activity, so the procalcitonin measure could be merely acting as a comfort blanket to support the clinician's decision to stop antibiotics. Indeed, the practice in our ICU, reported in 2004, 21 showed a median duration of treatment for bacteraemia of 5-5.5 days, without the use of procalcitonin monitoring, and with very low relapse rates. If anything, our current practice is even shorter, although this has not been Infection in the critically ill ii5 JAC formally measured. The extent to which an antibiotic course can be safely truncated requires many more prospective, randomized studies in different infections affecting different patient populations. A trial comprising Dutch adults with mild to moderate/ severe community-acquired pneumonia who had improved after 3 days of treatment with intravenous amoxicillin, involved randomization to either placebo (n\u00bc 56) or a further 5 days of oral amoxicillin (n \u00bc63). 22 Outcomes (clinical and radiological success rates) were similar in both groups. From Auckland, Briggs et al. 23 reported a case series of 90 patients with proven (n\u00bc 72) or probable (n\u00bc 16) meningococcal disease who received just 3.1+0.5 (mean+SD) days of intravenous benzylpenicillin. Of the six who died, four did so soon after admission while still on treatment, with the other two dying of late complications resulting from the initial multi-organ failure. No microbiological relapses were seen, either in the short or long term. Even more extreme, at least in a Western context, was the study by Nathan et al. 24 performed in health clinics in Niger, where patients with meningococcal meningitis were randomized to receive a single intramuscular dose of either ceftriaxone or chloramphenicol. In cases of clinical failure, a second single dose was given after 24-48 h and, if failure persisted at 72 h, rescue treatment was intravenous ceftriaxone for a minimum of a further 4 days. Only 7% required a second dose at 24-48 h, and the rate of treatment failure at 72 h was 9% (mortality 5%). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, they found that only impaired consciousness at baseline, or diagnosis of another disease (alone or in association with meningococcal meningitis), remained significant risk factors for treatment failure at 72 h.",

Notably, 2008 was the first year in the UK that C. difficile death rates fell since reporting began in 1999. 34 Thus, indiscriminate use of gloves and hand gels may have potentially deleterious consequences in routine clinical practice. Effective hand hygiene should undoubtedly remain a cornerstone of modern medicine and we would not suggest otherwise. However, the evangelical zeal to adopt new methods should perhaps be tempered by measured reflection on their true efficacy and the unintended consequences of real-world implementation.

These policies undoubtedly cater to public concerns about the rising incidence of healthcare-acquired infection and the need to demonstrate clearly visible attempts at infection control.

Bizarrely, in contrast to the evidence base for many other infection control methods in intensive care, a wealth of evidence exists for this strategy, with over 50 randomized controlled trials performed. Meta-analyses show SDD is associated with significant reductions in lower airway and bloodstream infection rates and offers an overall survival benefit. 45 -47 The fear that this approach encourages bacterial resistance does not appear to be borne out; indeed, the reduction in infection has often led to an overall decrease in antibiotic use.",

A valid criticism is that many of the SDD studies are generally small, heterogeneous, largely single-centre, of low quality and not blinded. The recent large Dutch multicentre randomized controlled trial 48 employed a cluster-randomized design crossing over between SDD, selective oral decontamination (topical antibiotics without prophylactic parenteral agents) and standard care in over 5000 patients expected to stay in the ICU for longer than 48 h. In this study, survival benefit only became evident after statistical correction for differences in illness severity arising from imbalanced randomization.

He reviewed five representative large ICU studies and demonstrated a wide variation (19 -62%) in the proportion of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections assigned to CR-BSI, highlighting likely differences in local interpretation. National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance guidelines recommend that the use of multiple lines in a single patient should still be counted as 1 catheter day. Thus, a rate of 2.7 per 1000 catheter days would equate to approximately one CR-BSI per ICU bed per year. The health and economic impact of reducing CR-BSIs has not been assessed in the UK but would fall far short of numbers claimed for the USA. In 2006 Pronovost et al. 51 asserted that an estimated 80000 CR-BSIs occurred per annum in the USA, with up to 28000 deaths among ICU patients. With an average cost of care of US$45 000 per infection, they claimed the annual cost could be up to US$2.3 billion. This staggering amount equates to more than the entire UK critical care budget for 2008/9! 52 The Michigan Keystone project sought to implement five simple procedures to follow during venous catheter insertion, namely, hand washing, use of full-barrier precautions during the insertion of CVCs, cleansing the skin with chlorhexidine, avoiding the femoral site if possible, and removing unnecessary catheters. These five procedures were chosen on the basis of being recommended by the CDC and identified as having the greatest effect on the rate of CR-BSI and the lowest barriers to implementation. 53 The strength of the evidence base does not, however, actually hold up on closer scrutiny. 33 Pronovost et al. studied the impact of this five-step intervention in a before/ after study performed in 2004 in 103 Michigan ICUs. 51 They reported a dramatic fall in CR-BSIs from a median rate of 2.7 CR-BSIs per 1000 catheter/days at baseline to 0 at 3 months post-implementation, with low rates being maintained at 18 months. This was, however, an open study with diagnosis being made by an infection control practitioner. The authors did acknowledge some limitations, including the potential for under-reporting (no validity checks were made), non-evaluation of protocol compliance and, surprisingly, non-collection of any microbiological data. In addition, any impact on length of ICU stay, survival rates and antibiotic use were not recorded, nor were the numbers of blood culture samples taken in the different periods.",

            "text": "Of note, the last few years have seen ever-increasing external pressure by governmental quality bodies, insurance companies and media/public pressure groups on US hospitals to avoid 'never events', including CR-BSI and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Indeed, several US states have now enacted laws mandating disclosure of 'never events' and introduced remunerative or punitive measures for failure. Consumer (e.g. www.ConsumerReportsHealth.org) and business (e.g. www. leapfroggroup.org) groups now name and shame hospitals that are either poorly performing or who decline to release their data. Clearly, this has had an impact. Many hospitals now report zero infection rates. The Leapfrog Group found that roughly half of 1285 hospitals responding to a survey waived fees for 'never events', those that waived fees being much more likely to have perfect scores on the Leapfrog Safe Practices Score. The Michigan Health and Hospital Association Keystone:ICU (www. mhakeystonecenter.org) stated that a series of interventions to improve ICU safety, with daily goals and elimination of CR-BSI and ventilator-associated pneumonia, has resulted over a 5 year Infection in the critically ill ii7 JAC period (2004-09) in 1830 lives saved, 1 40700 excess hospital days avoided and US$271 million in healthcare dollars rescued in the state of Michigan alone. 54 The validity of these claims has not, to our knowledge, been substantiated, yet the UK Department of Health has been so impressed that the National Health Service is attempting to follow suit with the Matching Michigan project. 55 However, Edgeworth 50 has pointed out how estimates of excess length of stay due to CR-BSI (claimed to be 10 -20 days) are predominantly based on case -control studies, a design fraught with difficulties in both selecting controls and adjusting for potential confounders. Similar difficulties surround attributable mortality due to CR-BSI, which is reported to vary from 0 to 35%. Studies that employed more sophisticated approaches to correct for confounders have generally been unable to show a significant effect of CR-BSI upon mortality. This applies not only when all organisms are included but also holds when coagulase-negative staphylococci are excluded. 56 ",

            "text": "Having examined a range of policies for control and treatment of infection in the ICU setting, we are struck by the paucity of highlevel evidence underpinning decision making and the often contradictory data that receive minimal airing. Paradoxically, an intervention with a large evidence base, SDD, is largely rejected while interventions with little evidence of efficacy are promoted through either dogma and/or political imperative. Indeed, the lack of consistency in infection control and treatment policies between hospitals highlights the weakness of this evidence base and the vagaries of our behaviour. Millar 57 argues that the particular circumstances and environment of any healthcare facility predisposes to differing microbiological hazards, reducing the generalizability of practice recommendations and research findings. He rightly contends that government-driven targets to reduce specific infections (for instance MRSA bacteraemia, which accounts for just 2% of healthcare-associated infection in the UK) inevitably encourage deprioritization of other, nontargeted infections. Some of these (e.g. Gram-negative bacteraemias) are associated with an equal if not larger burden of adverse outcomes and yet, despite the huge increase in expenditure, staff effort and resource spent on infection control, are inexorably increasing. Furthermore, these targets and the procedures instituted to control them may distract from other, arguably more important, patient outcomes that may not be related to infection. His list of ideal properties for an infection target is reproduced in Figure 2 .",

We should address and prioritize the definitive studies needed to address current major deficiencies in our knowledge base. We need to identify the true outcome-and cost-effectiveness of an intervention, and not rely on headline-grabbing 'telephone' numbers to spark media interest and subsequent governmental activity and funding. We do recognize that benefit may be difficult to assess. This is especially pertinent when baseline rates of infection are low (such as CR-BSI) and when directly attributable mortality from such infections may represent perhaps only a small component of the overall cause of death in critical illness. With the financial crises currently besetting most healthcare systems, it is incumbent upon us to maximize the utility of our interventions, particularly when a bundled package is promoted with minimal scrutiny. Given that unequivocal evidence is unlikely to become available for many interventions, we would not suggest their immediate abandonment, but we should recognize their limitations and be prepared to modify practice as this changes. We also need to carefully assess the effect of real-world implementation of any change to detect unanticipated harm and understand the true cost -benefit balance.",
