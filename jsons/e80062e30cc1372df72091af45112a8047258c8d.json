Vaccinia virus as a vector for the full-length IBV cDNA has the advantage that modifications can be introduced into the IBV cDNA using homologous recombination, a method frequently used to insert and delete sequences from the vaccinia virus genome. Here we describe the use of transient dominant selection as a method for introducing modifications into the IBV cDNA. We have used it successfully for the substitution of specific nucleotides, deletion of genomic regions, and the exchange of complete genes.

Molecular analysis of the role of individual genes in pathogenesis of RNA viruses has been advanced by the availability of full-length cDNAs, for the generation of infectious RNA transcripts that can replicate and result in infectious viruses. The assembly of full-length coronavirus cDNAs was hampered owing to regions from the replicase gene being unstable in bacteria. We therefore devised a reverse genetics strategy for IBV involving insertion of the full-length cDNA, under the control of a T7 RNA promoter, into the vaccinia virus genome. This is followed by the in situ recovery of infectious IBV in cells transfected with the vaccinia virus DNA and infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (1).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "An advantage of using vaccinia virus, in addition to the stability of the IBV cDNA, is the ability to generate modified IBV cDNAs by homologous recombination for the subsequent rescue of recombinant IBVs (rIBVs).

In the first step, the modified IBV cDNA is inserted into a plasmid containing a selective marker under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter.

In the second step, the complete plasmid sequence, containing a region of the IBV cDNA to be modified, is integrated into the IBV sequence in the vaccinia virus genome (Fig. 2) . This occurs as a result of a single crossover event involving homologous recombination between the IBV cDNA in the plasmid and the IBV cDNA sequence in the vaccinia virus genome. Recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) expressing the Ecogpt gene are selected for resistance against mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine. In the third step, the MPA-resistant rVVs are grown in the absence of MPA selection, resulting in loss of the Ecogpt gene owing to a single homologous recombination event between duplicated sequences, present in the vaccinia virus genome resulting from integration of the plasmid sequence (Fig. 3) . During the third step two recombination events can occur, each of them with equal frequency.

A schematic representation of the recovery process for obtaining rIBV from DNA isolated from a recombinant vaccinia virus containing a full-length IBV cDNA under the control of a T7 promoter: (A) In addition to the vaccinia virus DNA containing the full-length IBV cDNA under the control of a T7 promoter, a plasmid, pCI-Nuc, expressing the IBV nucleoprotein, required for successful rescue of IBV, is transfected into CK cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus, FPV-T7, expressing T7 RNA polymerase. The T7 RNA polymerase results in the synthesis of an infectious RNA from the vaccinia virus DNA that consequently leads to the generation of infectious IBV being released from the cell. (B) Any recovered rIBV present in the media of P 0 CK cells is used to infect P 1 CK cells. The medium is filtered though a 0.22-m filter to remove any FPV-T7 virus. IBV-induced CPE is normally observed in the P 1 CK cells following a successful recovery experiment. Any rIBV is passaged a further two times, P 2 and P 3 , in CK cells.
