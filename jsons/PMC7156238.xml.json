A great deal of effort has been made toward exploring more realistic mathematical models for the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. The aim of these models is to both explain the observed epidemiological patterns and predict the consequences of the introduction of public health interventions to control the spread of diseases (see e.g., Diekmann and Heesterbeek  [5] for an overview).",

In modeling of communicable diseases, the incidence rate, i.e. the rate of new infections, often plays a key role in guaranteeing that the model does indeed give a reasonable qualitative description of the disease dynamics  [8], [9]. Great interest has been devoted to investigating the nonlinear dynamics, including Hopf bifurcation, saddle\u2013node bifurcation, Bogdanov\u2013Takens bifurcation, existence of periodic and homoclinic orbits, and so on. For example, Yorke and London  [10] showed that the incidence rate \u03b2(1\u2212cI)IS with positive c and time-dependent \u03b2(t) was in excellent agreement with the simulation results for measles outbreaks. Capasso and Serio  [11] adopted a saturated incidence rate of the form \u03b2IS/(1+\u03b1I), \u03b1>0, to represent \u201ccrowded effect\u201d or \u201cprotection measure\u201d in modeling the cholera epidemics in Bari in 1973. To incorporate the effect of behavioral changes for certain communicable diseases, Liu and coworkers  [12], [13] extended that idea and proposed a nonlinear saturated incidence function \u03b2SIl/(1+\u03b1Ih), where \u03b2SIl represented the infection force of the disease, and 1/(1+\u03b1Ih) measured the inhibition effect from the behavioral change of the susceptible individuals when the number of infectious individuals increased, with \u03b2, l, \u03b1, h\n>0. There were numerous results about nonlinear incidence rates in the literature, and we refer the reader to Ref.  [8] for a general review.",

In particular, the study of spatial epidemiology becomes an exciting and important area of research because space may strongly influence lots of important epidemiological phenomena due to the localized nature of transmission or other forms of interaction  [20], [21], [22], [23]. As a result, mathematical models with both time and space are more realistic in considering the process of epidemic spreading. To our knowledge, both discrete patchy models and continuous reaction\u2013diffusion systems are used to study the spatial heterogeneity  [24]. Patchy models are often used to describe directed movement among patches, while reaction\u2013diffusion systems are suitable for random spatial dispersal. For example, we may find epidemic wavefronts in reaction\u2013diffusion models, which corresponded to the real world observations as in the spread of the Black Death in Europe from 1347 to 1350  [25], [19].",

We note that in disease transmission models, time delay is an important quantity accounting for many epidemiological mechanisms. In particular, time delays can be introduced to model constant incubation period or sojourn times in an infective state. For example, using an SIR model with a maturation delay and vertical disease transmission Busenberg et al.  [26] obtained some periodic solutions. An SEIRS epidemic model with exponential demographic structure, disease related deaths and two delays corresponding to the latent and immune constant periods respectively was first analyzed by Cooke and van den Driessche  [27]. They identified a delay-dependent threshold parameter \u03b8 determining the local asymptotical stability of the equilibrium states. For a brief review of delay differential equations arising from disease modeling, we refer the reader to van den Driessche  [28].",

In Section  3, we summarize the dynamics of spatial epidemic model without time delay. Then, we derive the conditions for Turing instability occurring in Section  4 through the method of linear stability analysis. In Section  5, we illustrate the effect of time delay on the emergence of Turing patterns by performing extensive numerical simulations. Finally, conclusions and discussion are presented in Section  6.",

            "text": "In this paper, we use a simple S-I epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate to investigate the effect of time delay on the spatial epidemic model. Let S and I be the number of susceptible, infected and infectious individuals at time t. To incorporate saturation or multiple exposures before infection, Liu et al.  [12], [13] proposed a nonlinear incidence rate \u03b2SpIq with p>0, q>0. This form of nonlinear incidence rate, without a periodic forcing, could produce much wider range of interesting dynamical phenomena in comparison to bilinear incidence rate \u03b2SI. Owing to their simple form, they cannot involve many of the complex biological factors. However, they often shed insightful lights to help us understand some complex processes  [30], [34], [35]. In the present paper, let p=1 and q=2. Then we have the following spatial epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate (1){\u2202S\u2202t=A\u2212\u03b2SI2\u2212dS+d1\u22072S\u225cf(S,I)+d1\u22072S,\u2202I\u2202t=\u03b2SI2\u2212(d+\u03bc)I+d2\u22072I\u225cg(S,I)+d2\u22072I, where A is the recruitment rate of the susceptible, d is the natural death rate of the population, and \u03bc is the disease-related death rate from the infected. Here, X=(x,y) represents the space, and \u22072=\u22022/\u2202x2+\u22022/\u2202y2 is the usual Laplacian operator in two-dimensional space. The susceptible and infected individuals diffusion coefficients are denoted by d1 and d2, respectively. From the biological point of view, we suppose that all the parameters are positive throughout the paper. More details about the model can be found in our previous paper  [35].",

Specifically, there is a range of parameters in \u03b2\u2013\u03bc plane where the different spatial patterns can be obtained. On the one hand, for the non-delayed spatial system, different spatial patterns, such as regular stripe and spot patterns, can emerge for a range of parameter values  [35]. On the other hand, time delay has a significant impact on the pattern formation. More specifically, there are three aspects. Firstly, time delay can change the pattern essence, such as the arm length and the direction of the stripe, see Fig. 2, Fig. 4. Secondly, time delay can largely postpone the pattern formation of the infected population density I, comparing Fig. 3, Fig. 5. Thirdly, time delay can widen the Turing space. In other words, for the non-delayed spatial epidemic model, there is no pattern occurring; while for the delayed one, stationary stripe and spot patterns may coexist in the distribution of the infected population density, and the dynamics of the system does not undergo any further changes finally (see Fig. 6 and main text for more details).",

In the past few years, a great deal of attention has been paid to transitions between different dynamical regimes as a result of perturbation of the system\u2019s parameters  [43]. For simplicity, we let other parameter values remain fixed and vary only one parameter, such as \u03b2 or \u03c4 in the present paper. In Ref.  [29], Sun et al. studied a spatial S-I model with logistic growth and nonlinear incidence rates \u03b2SpIq with p+q=1, and obtained not only a stripe-like pattern but also a spot pattern, or coexistence of the two. Then, in Ref.  [35] they assumed the recruitment of population with constant rate and set p=1 and q=2. However, little attention has been paid to the time delay accounting for constant incubation period or sojourn times in an infective state, which may have significant impact on pattern formations of infected population density. Hence, in this paper, we unfold it by extensive numerical simulations.",

Usually, one needs taking care of the joint effect of diffusion and time delay  [54] to obtain stability conditions which depends on transcendental equation associating characteristic eigenvalue \u03bb with a function e\u03bb\u03c4. In addition, the presence of noise  [55], [56], [57], [58] or other terms may give rise to a rich variety of dynamical effects  [59], including noise-enhanced stability  [60], noise-delayed extinction  [61], [62] and noise-induced transitions  [63]. For example, pattern formation induced by the noise in two competing species was analyzed by Valenti et al.  [55]. Nonmonotonic behavior of spatiotemporal pattern formation in noisy population dynamics has been found by Fiasconaro et al.  [56]. A model for epidemic dynamics was analyzed by Chichigina et al.  [57], using a pulse noise model with memory. The effect of multiplicative noise, always present in population dynamics, in the form of a pulse train with regulated periodicity, on a parametric instability was investigated by Chichigina et al.
