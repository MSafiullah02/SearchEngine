This March, however, marked a turning point of the United States\u2019 response to the COronaVIrus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the face of lack of early centralized national guidance, increasing infections and deaths have prompted entire cities and states to cancel events and close bars, restaurants, beaches, and other areas where people gather in an effort to minimize opportunities for spread. These efforts are in place to support social distancing, in order to decrease the impact of COVID-19 across the United States.",

During training, we have seen devastating cases in the ICU, comforted family members who have lost loved ones, and supported caregivers faced with a difficult decision to continue or cease life support. Our medical school peers, now hospitalists and anesthesiologists, are running out of masks,1 and we personally expect that even as cancer specialists, we will be drawn into the frontlines against this pandemic. The preparatory measures taken by all in the medical profession reflect this concern; in our own specialty, radiation oncology, we have begun deferring less urgent cases and developing guidelines for triaging radiotherapy given the almost certain strain that our hospital system will face when caring for COVID-19 patients.",

Pictures of Spring Break revelers belie the proactive, innovative, and generous roles taken by these young leaders in medicine. In our clinic now, resident physicians have volunteered to take on patient-facing roles that typically are staffed by older providers, and are helping their more senior colleagues in leadership positions leverage the power of virtual meetings and collaborative databases to minimize the possibility of virus exposure for those at higher risk of complications. Perhaps it\u2019s time to shine a spotlight on those millennials who are actively stepping up every day in the field of medicine. Positive attention will almost certainly do more to engage and motivate our young generations than repeated criticisms, dismissals, and stereotyping from older generations.",

Their ability to rapidly distill information, with long-standing engagement with rapid news cycles, will enable them to seamlessly move with the rapid-changing and fluid nature of the pandemic. Engagement with social media will facilitate communication between peer groups. Finally, their motivation to break down traditional social hierarchy may allow them to better reach our leaders with innovative ideas to mitigate the economic impact of this pandemic.",
