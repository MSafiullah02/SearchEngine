            "text": "In December 2019, an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is now officially named as \u201ccoronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)\u201d by the WHO [1, 2, 3]. The disease has spread rapidly from Wuhan to other regions in China. As of March 17, 2020, a total of 80,881 COVID-19-confirmed cases were reported in China [4]. Internationally, confirmed cases have been reported in >150 countries and regions around the world at present [5]. On January 3, 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified in a bronchial alveolar lavage fluid sample from a patient in Wuhan and confirmed to be the cause of COVID-19 [6]. Whole genome sequencing and systematic analysis showed that this novel coronavirus is a distinct clade from beta coronavirus associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome [6], which was officially named \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d by WHO now. Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated, current evidence suggests it was transmitted to humans through the spread of wild animals illegally sold in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [7]. Case reports have confirmed the interpersonal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [8]. Currently, there are no specific treatments or vaccines for COVID-19. Huang et al. [9] first reported 41 COVID-19 cases, most of whom had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The patient's clinical manifestations included fever, unproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, normal or decreased white blood cell count, and imaging evidence of pneumonia [9]. Wang et al. [10] reported in 138 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed cases, presumed hospital-related transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mortality was 4.3%. In this study, the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed, and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function were explored.",

The criteria for the confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 were that at least one gene site was amplified to be positive for nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1ab gene. In brief, the throat swab was put into a collection tube containing 150 \u03bcL viral preservation solution, and the total RNA was extracted within 2 h with the respiratory sample RNA separation Kit (Zhongzhi, Wuhan). The suspension was used for RT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two target genes, including NP and ORF1ab, were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time RT-PCR assay. Target 1 (NP): forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT; reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTC AAGCTG; and the probe 5\u2032-FAM-TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3\u2032.

The real-time RT-PCR assay was performed using a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd).

Recent a study shows that the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is similar to bat coronavirus HKU9-1 [16]. These coronaviruses have a 3-dimensional structure of spike protein, which is closely bound to human cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, the cells with ACE2 expression may act as target cells and be susceptible to COVID-19 infection, such as type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the lung [17]. It should be noted that ACE2 protein has been proved to have an abundant expression in many kinds of cells, such as intestinal epithelial cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, heart, artery smooth muscle cells, and gastrointestinal system [18]. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may invade the lung, upper respiratory tract, ileum, heart, and kidney, which may lead to dyspnea, diarrhea, acute heart injury, and AKI, especially in the case of viremia.",

It was found that 63% (32/51) of the patients exhibited proteinuria, 19% (11/59) and 27% (16/59) of the patients had an elevated level of plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen, respectively. Moreover, the CT scan showed radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys in 100% (27/27) of the patients. Therefore, it was concluded that renal impairment is common in COVID-19 patients, which may be one of the major causes of the illness by the virus infection and also may contribute to multiorgan failure and death eventually.",

Although 12 patients (10.8%) without CKD showed mild increase of BUN or SCr (<26 \u03bcmol/L within 48 h), and 8 patients (7.2%) showed trace or 1+ albuminuria after infection with the virus and during the treatment of pneumonia, all these patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria of AKI.

There were no predialysis patients with significant CKD in this study, which prevented the observation for these patients because they are indeed at high risk of AKI. This is just a chance, which made us regret that we could not observe whether these predialysis patients with CKD would develop to AKI and worsen the original CKD after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The issue resulted in one of the limitations of the study, but it did not affect the observation for the patients without CKD. We did observe that there was no AKI in these patients without CKD, which is the main purpose of this study to conclude that AKI was uncommon in COVID-19.",

Except regular CRRT, the monitoring of renal function indicators showed stable state, without exacerbation of CKD in the course of treatment of COVID-19. The reexamination of CT showed that pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. Unlike a formidably high mortality in SARS complicated with renal impairment, none of the patients died from the aggravation of CKD or from COVID-19 itself caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. It was also suggested that CRRT plays an important role in the treatment of COVID-19 complicated with CKD. Nevertheless, the renal function of patients with COVID-19 needs to be monitored regularly, especially in patients with elevated plasma creatinine. In the event of signs of AKI, potential interventions, including CRRT, should be used to protect renal function as early as possible.
