Both medications prolong the QT interval and accordingly may put patients 36 at increased risk of torsades de pointes and sudden death. Published guidance 37 documents vary in their recommendations for monitoring and managing these potential 38 adverse effects. Accordingly, we set out to conduct a systematic review of the 39 arrhythmogenic effect of short courses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. We 40 searched in MEDLINE and Embase, as well as grey literature up to April 17, 2020, on 41 the risk of QT prolongation, torsades, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death with 42 short-term chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine usage. This resulted in 390 unique 43 records, of which fourteen were ultimately selected for qualitative synthesis and which 44 included data on 1515 COVID-19 patients. Approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients 45 treated with these drugs developed QT prolongation. We found evidence of ventricular 46 arrhythmia in two COVID-19 patients out of a group of 28 treated with high-dose 47 chloroquine. A limitation of these results is unclear follow-up and possible 48 publication/reporting bias, but there is compelling evidence that chloroquine and 49 hydroxychloroquine induce significant QT interval prolongation and potentially increase 50 the risk of arrhythmia. Daily ECG monitoring and other risk mitigation strategies should 51 be considered in order to prevent possible harms from what is currently an unproven 52 therapy. 53 torsades de pointes; arrhythmia; sudden death 55 71 are other risk factors which promote torsades (Table 1) . 5",

            "text": "Hence, there is concern about ventricular arrhythmias stemming from the newfound use 73 of these agents. On one hand, clinical experience with these medications in the 74 Western world is generally with chronic conditions such as lupus. Due to their long half-75 life (approximately one month), 6 chronic usage of these drugs will result in more 76 accumulation and greater concentrations than short-term doses, with theoretical time to 77 steady-state being roughly four months. Accordingly, the shorter regimens used to treat 78 5 COVID-19 may be safer. On the other hand, patients with COVID-19 may represent a 79 population at greater arrhythmic risk given the high frequency of myocardial injury, heart 80 failure and concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications. 7 For instance, most 81 protocols suggest combination with azithromycin, another QT-prolonging agent. Yet 82 both agents may affect repolarization reserve in ways beyond I Kr alone. 8 Moreover, 83 interleukin-6 impairs I Kr and hypoxia may also increase the late sodium current (I LATE ). 84 Accordingly, more severely ill COVID-19 patients may be more predisposed to a 85 synergistic torsadogenic effect. 9,10 86 Multiple publications have already appeared with guidance on how to monitor for and 87 manage QT prolongation with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. 88 However, their recommendations are not entirely consistent. For instance, some 89 authors recommend all patients receive a baseline and repeat ECG, 11,12,13 whereas 90 others reserve this for certain higher-risk populations. 14 91 Although ECG monitoring can help prevent torsades, 15 possible issues include 92 increased workload, use of personal protective equipment, and exposure to infected 93 patients. 11 An adequate knowledge of the potential benefit of ECG monitoring in this 94 setting is essential for informed decision-making. We therefore conducted a systematic 95 review of the risk of QT prolongation, torsades, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden 96 death with short courses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as used in the treatment 97 of COVID-19.",

Our included studies indicate that COVID-19 patients treated with these 176 agents are older than participants in malaria studies, with mean subject ages of 46.9 177 and 20.8 years, respectively, and with more baseline comorbidities. COVID-19 patients178    have a high frequency of directly arrhythmic risk factors, such as sepsis, multi-organ 179 failure, hypoxia, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, and use of other QT-prolonging agents 180 (e.g., azithromycin, SSRIs, amiodarone). Moreover, COVID-19 may also induce indirect 181 risk factors, such as acute kidney injury, which can cause accumulation of chloroquine 182 and hydroxychloroquine to toxic levels, 26 and which one included study noted had the 183 best predictive value for QT prolongation. 21184The results of this review lend support to this hypothesis. A study of chloroquine and 185 azithromycin in 116 healthy volunteers had no ECG-related drug discontinuations occur.186In COVID-19 patients, however, approximately 10% of patients developed QT 187 prolongation to a degree that generally leads to the drug being withdrawn (QTc \u2265 500 188 ms or change > 60 ms). Although COVID-19 itself may be a confounding factor in this comparison, one pre-print of a non-consecutive case series of COVID-). It is also notable that a randomized trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in severe COVID-193 19 patients reported only one instance of QT prolongation among 95 patients treated 194 with this combination, and no instances among 99 receiving standard care. 27 While this 195 is an indirect comparison, the considerably smaller proportion with QT prolongation in 196 this population suggests that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine play an important role 197 in QT prolongation in COVID-19 patients. 198 This apparent increased risk of QT prolongation was associated with two ventricular 199 arrhythmias in the included studies, both in patients receiving high doses of chloroquine 200 (2 g/day). While the authors of this study did not report a causality assessment, a 201 causative role of chloroquine is suggested by the lack of events in the lower-dose arm 202 (750 mg twice daily on first day, then 750 mg/day) of this randomized trial. Nonetheless, 203 the low number of events prevents definitive conclusions about causality. While there 204 was report of two conduction abnormalities with unclear causation, no ventricular 205 arrhythmias were reported at any lower dose, which suggests the relative cardiac safety 206 of these agents when used at typical doses, provided regular ECG monitoring is 207 performed. 208 Strengths of these findings include our thorough search strategy, which included non-209 English and industry data. Most included trials also appeared to have complete patient 210 follow-up. However, the largest report (n = 1061) had unclear follow-up, and an earlier 211 report from the same institution appears to have only included patients with six days of follow-up available, making it possible that some may have been lost to follow-up. This 213 requires particular caution in the study of rare toxicities, where even a single missed 214 event can significantly change estimates of risk. Publication and reporting bias, 215 previously observed in reporting of harms, 28 may also contribute to underestimation of 216 risk. Moreover, most included data came from pre-prints which have not gone under 217 peer review, meaning this data is preliminary and possibly more susceptible to such 218 biases. 219 Published studies of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients which postdate our 220 search illustrate some of these concerns. One study of 40 ICU patients in France 221 treated with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily for 10 days (with or without 222 azithromycin) noted that 14 (36%) developed QT prolongation, albeit with no 223 arrhythmias reported. 29 However, another recent study of 90 hospitalized COVID-19 224 patients, despite more closely agreeing with our review's estimate of QT prolongation 225 incidence (20%), also reported an event of torsades de pointes in a patient given 226 hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. 30 This event occurred three days after these 227 drugs were discontinued, and other risk factors were present, such as bradycardia, 228new-onset cardiomyopathy, and use of propofol, a drug that is considered a known risk 229 factor for torsades de pointes. 31 Thus, the role played by hydroxychloroquine is 230 uncertain. Nevertheless, given that the long half-lives of these agents still implicate 231 them as possible contributors, at the very least this provides a reminder that even a 232 small number of newly reported events could considerably shift risk estimates and, thus, 233 risk-benefit analyses.",
