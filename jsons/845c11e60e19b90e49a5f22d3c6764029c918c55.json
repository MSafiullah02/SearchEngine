Consequently, a variety of air filters coated with antimicrobial agents have been developed to capture and inactivate virus particles in continuous airflow conditions. However, since aerosolized infectious viral-testing is inadvisable due to safety concerns, their anti-viral capability has only been tested by inserting the filters into liquid media, where infectious virus particles disperse. In this study a novel method of determining anti-viral performance of an air filter against airborne infectious viruses is presented. Initially, anti-viral air filter tests were conducted. Firstly, by an air-media test, in which the air filter was placed against an aerosolized non-infectious virus. Secondly, by a liquid-media test, in which the filter was inserted into a liquid medium containing a non-infectious virus. Subsequently, a correlation was established by comparing the susceptibility constants obtained between the two medium tests and an association was found for the air medium test with infectious virus. After ensuring the relationship did not depend on the virus species, the correlation was used to derive the results of the air-medium test from the results of the liquid-medium test.",

In all the aforementioned works, the bacteriophage MS2 virus was aerosolized using an atomizer or nebulizer, delivered to a filter by forced convection flow, and collected on the filter surface. The collected virus particles were then eluted from the filter surface to a liquid medium containing Escherichia coli strain C3000 (as the host of the bacteriophage MS2 virus) through physical vibration (sonication, vortex, and shaking) or elution with a urea-arginine phosphate buffer (U-APB) solution. Subsequently, plaque counting was performed, thereby enabling the evaluation of the effect of the NPs coated on the filter on the viability of the virus particle.",

In addition, because airborne virus particles move with airflow and can be captured by air filters used in indoor air cleaning, the data from the air media test are more practical and useful to people who need to use the air filters, such as healthcare workers (30, 31) . This paper presents a novel method of determining the anti-viral capability of an air filter against an airborne infectious virus. First, an Ag NP coated filter was inserted into a liquid medium in which infectious virus particles (H1N1) were dispersed. Then, the plaque counting method was conducted, hereafter termed the liquid media test. The results of the liquid media test were then converted to those of the air media test by using a correlation equation, which was established by comparing the susceptibility constants obtained from the two media tests with the selected non-infectious virus particles. Susceptibility has been used to explain the relative importance of various parameters affecting antimicrobial efficiency, such as the coating areal density of Ag NPs on the filter surface. Yoon et al. (32) used the susceptibility constant to evaluate the antibacterial effects of Ag and Cu NPs.",

First, a circular filter sample of 1 cm in diameter was placed into the solution (Step 1). Then, the solution was incubated and shook at 37\u00b0C for 24 h (Step 2). Afterward, the solution was continually diluted with DI water to acquire a countable number of plaques, and the number of virus particles was then evaluated using the single agar layer method (Step 3).

In other words, the virus particles are more susceptible to Ag NPs in air media than in liquid media. One plausible reason for this could be that in the air media test, many of the virus particles may have directly contacted the Ag NPs after being deposited and fixed onto the surface of the filter. On the contrary, in the liquid media test, virus particles could move freely in the liquid, enabling many virus particles to avoid contact with the Ag NPs.

Recently, many researchers have published works on the prevention and treatment of respiratory infection outbreaks caused by lethal viruses, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (5, 6), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (7, 8), novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1; cause of swine flu) (9, 10), and, very recently, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) first detected in Wuhan, China (11, 12). A variety of air filters coated with antimicrobial agents have been developed to capture and inactivate virus particles under continuous airflow conditions (13-19). Lee et al. (20) assessed the anti-viral performance of an iodine (I2)-releasing filter medium as a protective device against airborne pathogens by using MS2 aerosols. Rengasamy et al. (21) evaluated the efficacies of surgical filters treated with four different antimicrobial agents (silver-copper, EnvizO3-Shield, iodine-activated resin, and TiO2) against aerosolized MS2 viruscontaining droplet nuclei. Woo et al. (22) investigated the inactivated performance of dialdehyde cellulose filters against an airborne MS2 virus with various treatment times. In this study, we have investigated air filter coatings using different nanoparticles (NPs) and studied their anti-viral efficiencies against viruses captured by the filter. In our previous works, tests were conducted -infectious viruses for safety reasons. In addition, Joe et al. (23) fabricated an anti-viral filter using an aerosol coating of silica hybrid particles decorated with silver NPs (SiO2-Ag) and conducted an anti-viral ability test against the aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 virus. Furthermore, Park et al. (24) developed an instrument for dry coating a commercial air filter unit with a large number of SiO2-Ag NPs. They evaluated the filtration capability and anti-viral activity of the instrument against the aerosolized bacteriophage MS2. Moreover, Park et al. (25) coated a glass fiber filter medium with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and performed an inactivation test against the bacteriophage MS2 virus. Joe et al.

            "text": "antiviral capabilities of various anti-viral filters under continuous airflow conditions can be evaluated by performing an anti-viral test in a liquid medium without aerosolizing virus particles and (2) anti-viral capabilities can be quantitatively compared by comparing \u03ba values (where a higher \u03ba value corresponds to a higher anti-viral capability). Through testing conducted in liquid media, these results can be a basis for further fundamental research on predicting the viability of humaninfectious viruses that can cause respiratory diseases in air media.
