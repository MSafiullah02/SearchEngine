Known risk factors for acquiring RSV-associated LRTI include prematurity, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, down syndrome, compromised immunity, crowded living conditions, and exposure to tobacco or industrial smoke.\n9\n40\nMoreover, RSV-associated ARTI appears to be common in boys than girls;\n41\nthe reason for the male preponderance is believed to be due to immunomodulatory effects of the sex hormones during the early stages of life.\n42\nSevere RSV-associated respiratory disease has also been recognized as a significant health issue in adult populations, and epidemiological data suggest that the impact of RSV in adults is largely similar to nonpandemic influenza. ARTI due to RSV have been reported in the institutionalized elderly, the immunocompromised, and adults with cardiopulmonary diseases.\n43\n",

Isolation attempts often fail due to the lability of the virus.\n88\nHowever, the laboratory diagnosis should be sensitive and specific to identify viruses causing ARTI.\n87\nThus, timely detection of RSV resulting from a rapid and an efficient assay is important.\n89\nMany laboratory tests are often limited to a single virus, rather than allowing detection of multiple respiratory viruses. Although widely used techniques like viral culture and antigen detection have greater sensitivity over direct antigen testing (\nFig. 3\n) from respiratory samples, their ability to detect only a single pathogen is a limitation.\n90\nMolecular techniques (\nFig. 3\n) are highly effective and have facilitated the identification of previously known and new viruses.\n91\nMoreover, molecular characterization of different respiratory viruses for epidemiological purposes has been performed using different types of conventional and advanced DNA sequencing methods (\nFig. 3\n).\n",
