The case fatality risk is an estimate of the proportion of patients with a specific disease who have died; however, both the numerator and denominator of this estimator are elusive.2, 3, 4 Case detection is typically skewed towards patients with severe disease; laboratory-based case ascertainment can vary geographically and temporally; and there are delays between onset, death, and reporting, potentially leading to overestimation or underestimation of fatality risk.2, 4\n",

Similarly, severity estimates for avian influenza A H7N9 virus will be refined as the fate of all patients admitted to hospital is resolved and as serological attack rates become available (attack rates could be generated from cross-sectional surveys because background population immunity is low16).",

So far, the age distribution of reported cases of infection with avian influenza A H7N9 virus has been skewed towards old ages, which is probably explained by behavioural age differences in exposure to the animal reservoir.17 The age distribution of cases would probably shift towards younger ages in a full pandemic, resulting in a different and potentially decreased case fatality risk. Another issue would be to account for potential changes in disease severity as the virus rapidly evolves. Although conventional wisdom stipulates that virulence attenuates as a pathogen adapts to a new host, animal experiments suggest that influenza virulence could increase simultaneously with genetic drift.18 Furthermore, evidence from the 1918 pandemic suggests that the situation can escalate: case fatality risk increased by six times from the summer to the autumn of 1918.19\n",
