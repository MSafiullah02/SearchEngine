            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading across the world and have caused a global health emergency [1]. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mainly displayed pneumonia-associated symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, sputum production, and myalgia or fatigue [2, 3], indicating that SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract and causes acute respiratory disease. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in symptoms of diseases associated with other tissues, such as digestive (diarrhea, poor appetite, nausea, and vomiting), nervous (confusion and headache), and cardiovascular (palmus, chest distress, and cardiac injury) systems [2, 3]. In addition, some studies have indicated that person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur by routes outside of the respiratory tract [4]. A study of 99 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed that females were less susceptible to infection than males, and older males with comorbidities were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 [3]. Like SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5], SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host cell receptor [6\u20138]. A recent study uncovered that ACE2-expressing lung cells were more abundant in Asian males [9], potentially explaining the elevated susceptibility of males to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, the findings from that study are not sufficiently convincing due to a small number of samples being analyzed.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating ACE2 expression across a wide variety of human tissues. We found that although the inflammation of the lungs is the primary symptom of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the lungs had moderate expression of ACE2 among all tissues. This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may affect other tissues in addition to the lungs, including male tissues (testis and seminal vesicle). This indication has been confirmed by recent publications [2\u20134]. For example, Holshue et al. uncovered that stool from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that this virus may infect the gastrointestinal tract [5]. Huang et al. reported the virus-related cardiac injury in five patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [2]. A study of 99 cases of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia revealed the increased susceptibility of males to infection by this virus [3]. In fact, many cases of SARS-CoV-2 have reported symptoms outside of pneumonia, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, confusion, headache, and cardiac injury [2\u20134]. In addition, the predominant symptoms of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 could be attributed to the fact that the respiratory tract is the readiest transmission approach for the virus.",

Interestingly, while inflammation of the lungs (pneumonia) is the most common disease caused by coronavirus, the correlations between expression of the ACE2 receptor and immune signatures in the lungs differed between males and females and between young and old persons. This indicates that the host immune response to coronavirus infection could differ between males and females and between young and old persons, partially explaining why males and females and young and old persons have markedly distinct clinical outcomes of coronavirus infections [3, 18]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that lung cells highly expressing ACE2 are more readily infected by SARS-CoV [19]. We found that the correlation between ACE2 expression and immune signatures was negative in the lung tissue of females and younger persons, but it was positive in the lung tissue of males and older persons. Collectively, this means that: i) if the lungs highly expressing ACE2 are infected by SARS-CoV-2 in females or young persons, they will have weaker immune signatures, and ii) if the lungs highly expressing ACE2 are infected by SARS-CoV-2 in males or older persons, they will have stronger immune signatures. This suggests that an excessive immune response (cytokine storm or immunopathological damage) could be more likely to occur in males and old persons with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

We will try to clarify the survival, death, transfer, and transformation of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissue niches, and explore the virus in vivo inactivation in human body during and after epidemic. In addition, our pilot data suggest that cigarette smoke or nicotine inhalation inhibits the expression of ACE2/AT2R in multiple tissues, including the brain, heart and lungs, thus disrupting the balance within the renin-angiotensin system.",

In particular, because mRNA expression pattern of ACE-2 is not necessarily the same as its protein expression pattern across tissues due to some factors probably affecting the mapping from mRNA level to protein level, such as post-translational modification, the validation of our mRNA-based findings at protein level is important and worth further investigation. Second, the tissue mRNA expression did not capture the mRNA expression in individual cell types that would be important for precisely understanding the virus-host interaction. An analysis of the single-cell RNA-Seq data may address this issue. However, because the single-cell RNA-Seq data across such a wide variety of human tissues are lacking, it is not realistic to perform such an analysis. Third, the comparison of ACE2 expression levels between Asian and non-Asian races in TCGA datasets was performed in a small number of samples, and thus the associated results need to be verified in larger populations. Finally, our data cannot explain the epidemic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in that SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent but more infectious than SARS-CoV. An in-depth analysis of the genomic and protein structures of both coronaviruses would warrant exploring the mechanism underlying the epidemic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.",
