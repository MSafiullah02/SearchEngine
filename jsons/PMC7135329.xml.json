Yet the bad behavior is not exhibited in the ED. Why? It\u2019s almost a tacit compact: bad behavior is checked at the door in exchange for this agreement that the physician, nurse, the whole health care system is going to work in the best interests of that patient.\u201d He cites the \u201cbroken windows\u201d argument of sociologists James Q. Wilson and George Kelling15\u2013the idea that well-maintained, orderly public spaces deter both petty crime and more violent behavior\u2013as a strong rationale connecting physical and aesthetic signals to the maintenance of that tacit compact.
