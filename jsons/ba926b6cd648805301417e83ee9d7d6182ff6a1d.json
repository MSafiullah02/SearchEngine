Approximately 30% of all insecticides applied worldwide are used to control insects affecting vegetables and fruits. Transgenic, or more commonly referred to as genetically modified (GM), vegetables and fruits offer unique opportunities for controlling insects and the pathogens they transmit. Aphid transmitted viruses have been particularly difficult to manage by tactics aimed at reducing aphid populations and in many cases there has not been virus resistant plant germplasm. Farmers in the USA have benefited from having GM virus resistant squash and papaya available to them as tools in their overall IPM programs. In the USA, Bt sweet corn has proven effective for control of Lepidoptera and continues to be accepted in the fresh market. However, the best opportunities for GM vegetables and fruits are in developing countries where 83% of the world's population lives, the majority of vegetables and fruits are produced and pest problems are most acute.",

Farmers involved in production of fruits and vegetables usually earn much higher farm incomes compared to cereal producers, with per capita farm income up to 5-fold higher (Lumpkin et al., 2005) . Horticultural crops are generally more knowledge and capital intensive than cereal crops and they suffer from many biological stresses including insects, diseases and weeds. Because of their diversity within and between plant families, their pest complexes are far more varied and complex compared to field crops. Considerably fewer resources have been directed at improving their production and pest management options compared to staple crops such as rice, wheat and maize (Lumpkin et al., 2005) . Vegetables and fruits are high value commodities with high cosmetic standards, and the main method for control has been the frequent use of pesticides. In the case of insecticides, nearly 30% of the worldwide $8.1 billion annual insecticide market is applied to fruits and vegetables (Krattiger, 1997) . Insecticides are regularly applied to control a complex of insects that cause damage by feeding directly on the plant or by transmitting pathogens that harm plants.",

The literature suggests that more GM vegetables are commercialized (or soon to be so) than GM fruits. This is understandable since vegetables are annuals and require the purchase of new seed, ensuring a continuing market for seeds. Consequently, in this chapter more emphasis will be placed on GM vegetables. What follows is not meant to be a comprehensive review, but an effort to provide insights into some important projects and the issues they represent. Unlike other examples of GM insect-resistant plants discussed in other chapters of this book (i.e. cotton and maize), GM insect-resistant vegetables and fruits have often been developed through partnerships between the private and public sector. This is likely the result of vegetables and fruits being \"minor crops\" that are not grown on such extensive areas and generally have limited research and extension resources compared to field crops. Private-public partnerships help leverage resources and create new opportunities for moving much needed technologies forward. In this chapter, several projects on insect-resistant GM plants are described and the ways in which these technologies are being incorporated into IPM programs are discussed.",

Many plant viruses are vectored by insects, including aphids, whiteflies, thrips and leafhoppers. Aphidvectored viruses are particularly problematic because many are transmitted in a non-circulative and non-persistent manner (Zitter et al., 1996; Gonsalves, 1998) . This means that a very short time, i.e. a few seconds or minutes, is sufficient for aphids to acquire virus particles when probing on infected plants. A similarly short time period is enough for aphids to release virus particles when probing on healthy plants. The primary injury caused by aphid-vectored viruses arises not from the direct feeding damage of the aphids but from their ability to allow the virus to enter the plant and initiate the disease. Control has focused on using insecticides to control the vectors (aphids, whiteflies, thrips) or tactics such as mulches or barrier crops that lessen the likelihood of the vector landing on the crop (Hooks and Fereres, 2006) . Successes with both strategies have been variable.",

The insertion of a virus gene fragment into a susceptible plant can activate RNA silencing, a potent defense mechanism against viruses (Voinnet, 2005) . This mechanism confers virus resistance, providing a high degree of nucleotide sequence homology between the virus-derived transgene and the challenge virus. Resistance can be engineered against multiple viruses if gene fragments from different viruses are fused within a single expression cassette or pyramided within a single T-DNA region of a binary plasmid. The coat protein (CP) is commonly used to engineer virus resistance (Fuchs and Gonsalves, 2007) . Described below are two examples of virus-resistant transgenic crop cultivars expressing CP genes.",

PRSV also causes ringspots on fruits and affects fruit yield and quality. No useful resistance is known in the Caricaceae family. In Hawaii, PRSV caused production to fall from 58 million pounds in 1992 to 24 million pounds by 1998 (Fuchs and Gonsalves, 2007) . Orchard scouting and elimination of PRSV-infected trees is routinely used to limit the spread of the virus, but these approaches are only moderately successful (Gonsalves, 1998) . In the early 1980s, a team of scientists characterized PRSV, used rDNA to isolate and clone a gene for the CP of the virus, introduced the gene into plant cells using particle bombardment and created the first transgenic fruit for virus resistance ( Fig. 9 .1). Genetically modified papaya resistant to PRSV was commercially released in Hawaii in 1998 (Gonsalves, 1998) and has had a tremendous socio-economic impact. The adoption rate of virus-resistant transgenic papaya was rapid and widespread. Transgenic papaya cultivars were planted on more than half of the total papaya production area (480 ha) in 2004 in Hawaii (Fuchs and Gonsalves, 2007; Shankula, 2006) . Since the release of PRSV-resistant papaya cultivars, papaya production in Hawaii has reached a level similar to that before PRSV became epidemic in the 1980s (Shankula, 2006) .",

Three of the most important viruses affecting squash production are Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV), and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) (Zitter et al., 1996) . No summer squash cultivar with satisfactory resistance to CMV, ZYMV and WMV has yet been developed by conventional breeding (Gaba et al., 2004; Munger, 1993) . Control of squash viruses has focused on cultural practices, including delayed transplanting relative to aphid flights, use of reflective film mulch to repel aphids, and application of stylet oil (used to reduce virus transmission) in combination with insecticides to reduce aphid vector populations (Perring et al., 1999) . In the state of Georgia, it is estimated that ten applications of stylet oils and insecticides are made routinely to control aphids and, hence, limit virus incidence and transmission (Gianessi et al., 2002) .",

Subsequently, numerous squash types and cultivars have been developed by crosses and back crosses with the two initially deregulated lines. This material is highly resistant to infection by one, two or three of the target viruses, i.e. CMV, ZYMV and WMV (Arce-Ochoa Clough and Hamm, 1995; Fuchs and Gonsalves, 1995; Tricoli et al., 1995; Fuchs et al., 1998; Schultheis and Walters, 1998) .

Virus-resistant transgenic squash limits virus infection rates by restricting challenge viruses, reducing their titers, or inhibiting their replication and/or cell-to-cell or systemic movement. Therefore, lower virus levels reduce the frequency of acquisition by vectors and subsequent transmission within and between fields. Consequently, virus epidemics are substantially limited. Recently, it has been shown that commercial transgenic squash resistant to ZYMV and WMV does not serve as a virus source for secondary (i.e. within field) spread (Klas et al., 2006) . Virus-resistant transgenic plants are particularly valuable if no genetic source of resistance has been identified or if host resistance is difficult to transfer into elite cultivars by traditional breeding approaches due to genetic incompatibility or links to undesired traits. In such cases, engineered resistance may be the only viable option to develop virus-resistant cultivars. This is well illustrated by PRSV-resistant papaya. Engineered resistance may also be the only approach to develop cultivars with multiple sources of resistance. This has been the case for squash resistant to CMV, ZYMV and WMV.",

Prior to the introduction of PRSV-resistant transgenic papaya, growing papaya was no longer viable despite area-wide efforts to eradicate infected trees in order to limit the propagation of the virus. The cultivation of PRSV-resistant transgenic papaya cultivars dramatically reduced the incidence of PRSV in many areas allowing some growers to return to growing non-GM papaya, which is important for the high value Japanese market in which GM papaya is not allowed. Growers have been able to use the PRSV-resistant transgenic papaya cultivars as a trap crop (Shelton and Badenes-Perez, 2006) by growing it as a border around the non-GM crop and allowing it to cleanse viruliferous aphids of PRSV (Fuchs and Gonsalves, 2007) . Thus, the Hawaian papaya industry can now produce and market both transgenic and conventional papaya in the same field, and even organic papaya in adjacent fields if other organic practices are performed. This is a case in which organic agriculture directly benefits from GM crops, which are not allowed as part of the organic production philosophy.",

Of the 262,196 ha of sweet corn (fresh and processing) grown in the USA in 2006 (NASS, 2007) , it is estimated that <5% is Bt sweet corn expressing Cry1Ab endotoxin (Event Bt11). Processors have avoided growing Bt sweet corn because of concerns about export markets, so it has been grown only as a fresh market crop. Studies in New York have shown it to be very effective against the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (H\u00fcbner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), providing 100% clean ears when no other lepidopteran species were present and >97% when the two noctuids, Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) (fall armyworm), and Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (corn earworm), were also present (Musser and Shelton, 2003) . Studies in other states have shown that Bt sweet corn provided consistently excellent control of the lepidopteran pest complex (Lynch et al., 1999; Sorenson and Holloway, 1999; Burkness et al., 2001; Hassell and Shepard, 2002; Speese et al., 2005) . However, experiences indicate that under very high pressure by H. zea, supplemental sprays of synthetic insecticides often are required and that removal of broadspectrum sprays targeting Lepidoptera have resulted in damage from other species. Studies conducted by Dively and colleagues (unpublished) under high H. zea pressure in Maryland have indicated superior control, compared to Bt11, with sweet corn expressing both Cry1Ab endotoxin (Bt11 event) and the vegetative insecticidal protein VIP3A (MIR 162 event). By using appropriately timed insecticide applications with Bt sweet corn varieties, fresh market sweet corn growers in North Carolina have been able to extend their production later into the season when populations of H. zea and S. frugiperda are generally too high to control satisfactorily with insecticide applications alone (G.G. Kennedy, personal communication). Similar findings have been reported in South Carolina (Hassell and Shepard, 2002) . Even when two insecticide sprays are required on Bt11 sweet corn (e.g., for lateseason control of H. zea), an economic assessment in Virginia found a gain of $1,777/ha for fresh-market sweet corn vs. non-Bt sweet corn sprayed up to six times with pyrethroid insecticides (Speese et al., 2005) .",

In Florida, the corn silk fly, Euxesta stigmatias Loew (Diptera: Ulidiidae), has become problematic on Bt sweet corn and requires treatment (Nuessly and Hentz, 2004) . In some states dusky sap beetles, Carpophilus lugubris Murray (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), normally controlled by foliar insecticides, have become more problematic (Dowd, 2000) . In Minnesota and Pennsylvania, corn rootworm beetles or Japanese beetles clipping silks have recently become more prevalent, requiring at least one insecticide application for ear protection (W. Hutchison and S. Fleischer, personal communication). Nevertheless, the use of Bt sweet corn has proven to be very effective against the targeted, key pests (Lepidoptera) and plantings of Bt sweet corn continue to rise in the USA, with new Bt fresh-market hybrids being released each year. (HSPH, 2007) . Lepidopteran larvae are the most problematic insect pests of vegetable brassicas on a worldwide basis. One species in particular, the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is considered the most destructive insect pest and has severely limited brassica production, especially in resource-poor regions (Talekar and Shelton, 1993) (Fig. 9 .2). Plutella xylostella now occurs wherever brassicas are grown and causes losses to the world economy of about US$1 billion yearly (Talekar and Shelton, 1993) . Losses of cabbage and cauliflower due to P. xylostella frequently reach 90% without the use of insecticides (CIMBAA, 2007) . Even with frequent use of insecticides, substantial losses occur and threaten food security. In tropical areas where pest pressure is high, it is not uncommon to apply insecticides every other day. Such intense use of insecticides poses hazards to farmers, consumers and the environment and has caused populations of this insect to become resistant to most of the major insecticides.",

The latter carried the neomycin phosphotransferase gene and a full-length, synthetic, B. thuringiensis Cry1Ac-like gene, derived from HD-73. Progeny were produced by pollinating transformed plants with Green Comet hybrid broccoli and were used in our experiments. In addition to introducing cry1Ac into plants, similar methods were employed to produce plants expressing a cry1C gene (Cao et al., 1999) and pyramided plants expressing both cry1A and cry1C genes (Cao et al., 2002) . Strains of P. xylostella that had developed resistance in the field to Cry1A, Cry1C or both were used with the three types of Bt broccoli to conduct the studies highlighted below.",

This last finding supports the idea that previous reports showing harm to parasitoids by Cry1 toxins were likely due to poor host quality (sick or dying insects) rather than toxicity to the parasitoid (Romeis et al., 2006) . While these findings from this model insect-Bt plant system have been helpful for understanding IRM and biological control in the currently commercialized Bt crops (maize and cotton), they have also prepared the way for the introduction of commercialized Bt brassica vegetables. In fact, there is far more information available about IRM and non-target effects for Bt brassicas prior to their commercialization than was the case for Bt maize or Bt cotton.",

This partnership involves Nunhems, a major vegetable breeding company located in The Netherlands, and the following public partners: the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center in Taiwan (AVRDC), the Centre for Environmental Stress and Adaptation Research at the University of Melbourne in Australia, Cornell University in the USA, and the Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich -UK. CIMBAA includes additional international institutions to address specific research aspects of the project. The initial goal of CIMBAA is to make the dual-Bt technology available in varieties that are optimally adapted to growing conditions for cabbage and cauliflower in India. Once the developed material meets the regulatory standards for efficacy and environmental and human health, the bioengineered plants will be submitted to the regulatory system of India. Although India is the first country of interest, other countries have also expressed interest in joining CIMBAA. The ownership of the material, the regulatory dossier and any intellectual property rights (IPR) owned or jointly licensed by the collaborating parties will, to the extent possible, be transferred into public hands for dissemination, without technology fees, to brassica breeders in the developing world. These breeders will then be free to grow the material directly or breed the trait into their own varieties for sale and consumption. Nunhems' commercial interest in CIMBAA is to be the first company to produce the high value hybrids while the public side is focused on helping disseminate the technology into areas where it is most needed.",

After considerable discussion, it was decided that the CIMBAA plants would use cry1C and cry1B genes, because they had been shown to be effective against P. xylostella and cross-resistance between the two toxins was not detected . Additionally, studies had shown that resistance to Cry1C in P. xylostella is polygenic (Zhao et al., 2000) , making it more difficult for the insect to evolve resistance. Because the material would be transferred to brassica breeders, it was important that the integrity of the material be maintained.

Likewise, breeding efforts by Nunhems have produced cabbage and cauliflower lines that express both proteins at levels sufficient to control not only populations of susceptible P. xylostella but also populations of P. xylostella that are resistant to Cry1C (Shelton et al., unpublished) . No populations of P. xylostella have developed resistance to Cry1B so they are not able to be tested. Although P. xylostella is the chief target of the CIMBAA plants, other Lepidoptera may also be problematic in India and other future locations for CIMBAA products, so it is appropriate that they also be tested. Laboratory studies, conducted with the purified proteins, confirmed that the following Lepidoptera are very susceptible to at least one of the proteins: Pieris rapae (L.) (Pieridae), P. brassicae (L.) (Pieridae), Crocidolomia binotalis Zeller (Pyralidae), Hellula undalis (Fabricius) (Pyralidae). On the other hand, laboratory studies have shown that two other Lepidoptera species that may feed on cabbage are much less susceptible: Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Noctuidae) and Helicoverpa armigera (H\u00fcbner) (Noctuidae). Laboratory and greenhouse studies with CIMBAA breeding lines have shown excellent control of P. xylostella and P. rapae, and there are ongoing studies with other pest species as well as nontarget organisms.",

While Lepidoptera, especially P. xylostella, are the primary pests, aphids can also be problematic and must be controlled in a fashion that does not compromise the use of the Bt plants. Therefore, selective neonicitinoid insecticides, applied as a seed treatment or drench, are being considered as part of the overall strategy for the CIMBAA plants. Use of more broad-spectrum insecticides could potentially disrupt biological control agents such as predators and parasitoids that help control the different pests, as well as affecting other non-target arthropods. Studies on an important predator, Chrysoperla carnea (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), have shown that it is not harmed by either Cry1B or Cry1C when it is fed either protein directly (J. Romeis, unpublished) . However, testing the effects of either protein against a hymentopteran parasitoid is more problematic because the parasitoid feeds internally on the host's tissues. Thus, rigorous studies require populations of the host that are resistant to the toxin so host-quality mediated effects can be excluded. Using Cry1Cresistant P. xylostella, our studies have shown that its important parasitoid, Diadegma insulare (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), is not harmed when it parasitizes Bt-fed P. xylostella larvae . This is in stark contrast to parallel studies that demonstrated the parasitoid was harmed by commonly used insecticides.",

While models (Roush, 1997a) and greenhouse studies have shown the wisdom of the dual gene approach compared to single Bt genes, there should be extra caution about using Bt plants for P. xylostella management since it has demonstrated its ability to develop resistance to Cry toxins in the field, albeit when applied as foliar sprays. However, an alternative approach to using Bt plants would be to spray conventional insecticides, but these have generally failed even after only 3 years of use because of resistance evolution (Bates et al., 2005b) . Spraying formulated Bt insecticides is another option, but the risk of resistance evolution is greater with Bt sprays than with Bt plants because sprays create a mosaic of toxin concentrations on plants, which is not the case with Bt plants that more uniformly express a high dose of the Cry toxins. On sprayed plants, the insect population is subjected to a mosaic of doses, many of which are sublethal to heterozygotes in the insect population. It is the survival of the heterozygotes that drives resistance evolution and this can explain why P. xylostella resistance to a Bt protein developed faster with foliar sprays than when the insects were exposed to high dose Bt plants (Roush, 1997b) .",

It will also be important that other strategies be included in the overall management of P. xylostella. These strategies include the conservation of natural enemies, crop destruction at the end of the season to reduce population spread, and regular monitoring of susceptibility to the toxins. In many places where CIMBAA products will be grown, it will be difficult to promote the idea of planting refuges of non-Bt brassicas, although this is one of the major requirements for IRM in some countries and may account for the present lack of resistance evolution to Bt crops (Tabashnik et al., 2003; Ferr\u00e9 et al., chapter 3 , but see Matten et al., chapter 2 for a recent case of putative field resistance). While it has been demonstrated that Bt plants can, when used over multiple generations, drive down populations of P. xylostella , other IPM tactics should also be utilized. As an overall strategy, growers should be encouraged to grow non-brassica crops close by that will not serve as hosts for P. xylostella. Long-term studies in the broccoli production area of Mexico have shown the value of crop diversity in the landscape for managing P. xylostella over the long term (Hoy et al., 2007) . Bt brassicas will be a tremendous tool for farmers worldwide, but they should be incorporated into a larger IPM program.",

The crop is often considered a \"poor man's vegetable\" and is mainly cultivated on small family farms. It is an important source of nutrition and cash income for many resource-poor farmers. Eggplant is an annual plant attacked by a number of devastating diseases (Phomopsis blight, Verticillium wilt, and several viruses [Chen et al., 2002] ), and insects (including thrips, cotton leafhopper, jassids and aphids); however, the most damaging is the eggplant fruit and shoot borer (FSB), Leucinodes orbonalis Guen\u00e9e (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) (Fig. 9.3 ). Infestation is caused by adults migrating from neighboring fields, from eggplant seedlings, or from previously grown eggplants in the same planting area. Damage from L. orbonalis starts at the nursery stage and continues after crop transplanting until harvest. Losses have been estimated to be 54-70% in India and Bangladesh and up to 50% in the Philippines (ABSP II, 2007).",

There are no known eggplant varieties resistant to the borer, so the use of insecticide sprays continues to be the most common control method used by farmers. Fruit and shoot borer are only vulnerable to sprays for a few hours before they bore into the plant. Therefore, farmers spray insecticides as many as 80 times over a 7-month cropping season (AVRDC, 2001) . Farmers may even spray every other day, particularly during the fruiting stage (K. Vijayraghavan, personal communication). In Asia, chemical spraying for this insect accounts for 24% of the total cost of production (ABSP II, 2007) . Intensive use of insecticides raises serious concerns for environmental and human health.

The first concern is the potential for the insect to develop resistance to FSBR-eggplant (for a detailed discussion on the factors that influence resistance evolution, see Ferr\u00e9 et al., chapter 3). In the case of L. orbonalis, an IRM plan was developed and submitted to the Indian Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), which is responsible for environmental approval of activities involving transgenic products. The plan consists of a high dose-refuge strategy in which 5% of an area should be planted to non-Bt eggplant at the same time as the main planting. The refuge can be treated with another insecticide but not with Bt, and the crop in the refuge must not be destroyed at harvest so that susceptible alleles will be maintained in the L. orbonalis population. An intended IRM strategy is that seeds of Bt and non-Bt plants will be distributed together but in different packets, thus facilitating the refuge strategy. Training guides for Bt eggplant have been developed and will distributed when the product is commercialized. These training guides emphasize the need for growers to pay attention to any secondary insect pests, such as aphids and leafhoppers, as well as pathogens that will not be controlled by Bt eggplant, thus reconfirming the idea that the Bt eggplant is a component in the overall IPM program. In the future it may be possible to incorporate other types of insect-resistance genes into Bt eggplant. For example, Ribeiro et al. (2006) has described a genetically modified eggplant line expressing oryzacystatin, an inhibitory protein of cystein proteinases, that has a negative impact on population growth and mortality rates of the aphids, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas).",

While it is becoming less expensive to create GM crops for pest management, developing a marketable product and a regulatory package remains costly. Development and regulatory costs can be more readily recouped if the product is grown on an extensive area, as would be done with staple crops, but which is not generally the case for individual fruit and vegetable crops. For example, the large agriculture biotechnology companies have for the most part abandoned the development of GM vegetable and fruit crops because of the high costs associated with product development and deregulation. For vegetables, there are many varieties of the same crop and the half-life of a particular variety can be quite limited. Introducing a GM trait into a breeding program can be complicated and cost prohibitive, especially in crops where backcrossing is difficult or impossible (e.g. potatoes). In most countries, deregulation of a GM trait is event specific. For many vegetable crops, it is not possible to develop a single GM event that can be converted into many different varieties of a single vegetable species via conventional breeding. For example, Brassica contains about 100 species, including rapeseed, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, turnip and various mustards. No single parent exists that can be used to backcross the transgene into the many different types of Brassica species. Individual events would have to be developed for most of the different crop types and deregulation of more than one event for a single protein is problematic for most business models. For the few transgenic vegetable crops that are being developed, novel or unconventional strategies have been employed to bring the crops to market. For GM papaya, Gonsalves and his colleagues undertook much of the work without large financial backing from industry. They and Cornell (Gonsalves' institution) were able to develop freedom to operate (FTO) policies with little or no cost because the companies that held patents believed there was little financial incentive for them in papaya. Another approach is for a company to piggy-back its vegetable work with larger scale crops. This is essentially what was done with Bt sweet corn and Bt maize. A third approach is to develop the private-public partnerships in which the private sector would focus on selling hybrids to higher end producers while the public sector would focus on resource-poor farmers. The roles and the financial responsibilities of each partner need to be clearly defined and the eggplant model serves as a good example of a private-public partnership (for a detailed description, see Medakker and Vijayaraghavan, 2007) .",

Thus, they often operate in more complex agricultural systems in which insects may move from one crop to the next within the same farm. How this will impact the use and effects of GM plants in the agricultural landscape can be complex (Storer et al., chapter 10). If multiple GM insect-resistant plants are grown within the same area and if a polyphagous insect is exposed to the same Bt protein expressed in the different species, this will challenge the conventional IRM strategies developed for cotton and maize. Thoughtful consideration will be needed before choosing which toxins vegetable plants should express, and the selection should be based not only on what will be an effective toxin against the target insect but what toxins are already in use in other crops that may be hosts for the target insect. Additionally, the difficulty of sampling insect populations for resistant alleles will take on a higher level of complexity in a diversified vegetable system. Further consideration should also have to be given to the effects on non-target organisms within diversified GM plantings. In a study conducted in the northeastern USA, Hoheisel and Fleischer (2007) investigated the seasonal dynamics of coccinellids and their food (aphids and pollen) in a farm system containing plantings of Bt sweet corn, Bt potato and GM insect-resistant squash. Their results indicated that the transgenic vegetable crops provided conservation of cocinellids and resulted in a 25% reduction in insecticides. In a similar study with these same crops, Leslie et al. (2007) compared the soil surface dwelling communities of Coleopetera and Formicidae in the transgenic crops and their isolines and found no differences in species richness and species composition, but did find the transgenic vegetables required fewer insecticide applications. Such results bode well for GM plants within vegetable IPM systems.",

Farmers will likely save GM seed, move GM seed between locations, and some GM products may move into markets that do not permit these products. These concerns will be lessened if GM plants are consumed locally and in accordance with national biosafety regulatory policies. However, it is likely that violations will occur and this will challenge legal systems.",

It is equally clear that such technology must be introduced within the context of IPM. While each vegetable and fruit has its own set of one of more key pests, other pests can also be problematic. Traditional broad-spectrum insecticides often controlled a suite of pest insects. Thus, when Bt (or other GM) vegetables and fruits are introduced into production systems, other methods of control will have to be applied or developed for secondary pests. Because the present GM technologies have proven to be less harmful to natural enemies, biological control of secondary pests may be more achievable but other tactics such as the use of selective insecticides (applied either as seed treatments or foliar sprays) may be necessary (Romeis et al., chapter 4) .",

In the USA where labeling of GM products is not required, virus resistant squash and papaya and Bt sweet corn are consumed by the public with little or no thought about the role these crops have played in managing difficult pests.

In 2007 about 83% of the world's 6.3 billion population lived in developing countries, and this proportion is expected to increase rapidly in the next several decades. Nearly 46% of the world's vegetables and fruits are grown in China and India, two countries that account for nearly 40% of the world's population and where pest problems are severe. Both countries have readily adopted Bt cotton (Naranjo et al., chapter 6) and it is likely that Bt rice will be commercialized in China in the near future (Cohen et al., chapter 8). Acceptance of GM crops in these two countries will make it more likely they will adopt GM vegetables and fruits. This in turn will likely hasten their adoption in other parts of the world and allow farmers to use this technology in their overall IPM programs. With the eventual acceptance of GM technology, it is expected that the costs associated with deregulation will become more affordable and that the biotech industry will become more interested in developing GM vegetables and fruits, especially for the developing countries.",
