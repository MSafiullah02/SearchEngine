            "text": "Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) represents one of the greatest challenges to neurobiology and impose a rapidly increasing social and financial burden upon society. Although neurodegenerative disorders are variously classified according to symptomology, natural history, genetics and neuronal loss, there is an emerging consensus that the underlying molecular mechanisms are common to many NDDS. The vast majority of the literature addresses the roles of specific proteins in mediating neurodegeneration. Here, we review the groundswell of data that supports the view that RNA dysfunction plays a central role in NDDs. We start by providing a brief overview of the types of molecular mechanisms that have been implicated in NDD, then discuss the role of non-coding RNA transcripts in the nervous system and the various ways in which they are implicated in disease mechanisms.",

Oxidative stress responses affect, and are influenced by, several neural processes implicated in the progression of NDDs including protein folding, aggregation and the degradation of abnormal protein species, membrane lipid peroxidation, calcium homeostasis and DNA repair (Jellinger, 2009). Reactive oxygen species are predominantly produced during mitochondrial respiration and during periods of prolonged inflammation, thereby providing a link between oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammatory responses (Coppede and Migliore, 2010).",

Oligomeric and aggregated species of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau, \u03b1-synuclein, and huntingtin are found in AD, PD and HD brain, respectively, whereas aggregated deposits of TDP-43, SOD-1 and neurofilaments characterise affected regions of ALS brain (Gadad et al., 2011). It should be noted that these pathologies are not exclusive to individual NDDs; TDP-43 positive inclusions are apparent in PD, AD and related tauopathies (Warraich et al., 2010, Cohen et al., 2011), and neurofibrillary pathology is observed in PD and other Lewy body dementias (Wray and Lewis, 2010) where MAPT haplotype is known to affect disease risk (Simon-Sanchez et al., 2009). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that there may be synergistic interactions between several disease-associated proteins in NDDs (Elbaz et al., 2011, Herman et al., 2011, Waxman and Giasson, 2011).",

However, at least in AD, there is now substantial evidence that oligomeric protein species are more closely associated with synaptic dysfunction, functional deficits and neuronal loss (Walsh et al., 2002, Berger et al., 2007). Indeed, filamentous aggregates may simply represent an inert end-product as suggested by the prolonged presence of neurofibrillary tangles in otherwise healthy and functioning neurons (Morsch et al., 1999, Santacruz et al., 2005). Alternative interpretations suggest that the assembly of protein filaments is a protective response mounted by degenerating neurons in NDDs (Ross and Poirier, 2005).",

Huntingtin aggregation results from either transglutanimase-catalysed cross-linking or polar zipper formation in the expanded polyQ sequence (Jellinger, 2009), while MAPT and SNCA[N4] mutations, in addition to phosphorylation and conformational change, promote the misfolding of tau and \u03b1-synuclein into pro-aggregatory secondary structures (Hanger et al., 2009, Gadad et al., 2011). Proteolytically cleaved fragments of tau, \u03b1-synuclein, TDP-43, and possibly huntingtin promote aggregation (Lunkes et al., 2002, Dufty et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2010), perhaps by nucleation-dependent seeding. In addition, failures in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and/or lysosomal autophagic clearance pathways are suggested to increase cytosolic protein concentrations and promote the aggregation of these key disease proteins (Bove et al., 2011, Nijholt et al., 2011) And this may be influenced by post-translational modifications of the target proteins (Nijholt et al., 2011).",

Although multimeric and misfolded proteins may gain toxic properties (Gadad et al., 2011), there is also substantial evidence that oligomer and/or aggregate-induced synaptic and neuronal toxicity results from a loss of normal function in specific NDDs, for example as a result of cytoskeletal instability and axonal transport deficits upon tau detachment from microtubules in AD and related tauopathies (Brunden et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Axonal transport defects occur early in NDD, and are believed to contribute to disease progression (reviewed by De Vos et al., 2008). Disruption to axonal transport can result via several mechanisms. Reduced tubulin acetylation in HD can disrupt binding of the molecular motor, kinesin, to microtubules and slow axonal transport (Dompierre et al., 2007), whereas A\u03b2, and mutant TDP-43, huntingtin and SOD1 disrupt the transport of mitochondria (Schon and Przedborski, 2011), thereby reducing ATP supply, including that to molecular motors. Aberrant kinase and phosphatase activities also contribute to axonal transport deficits in NDDs since increased phosphorylation of both motors and cargoes reduces their ability to interact. For example, glutamate excitotoxicity, inflammation, and increased expression of A\u03b2, mutant presenilin-1 and CAG expanded huntingtin, stimulate the activity of several protein kinases in NDDs, leading to phosphorylation of kinesin and cargoes such as tau and neurofilaments (De Vos et al., 2008, Morfini et al., 2009). Tau is also proposed to compete with kinesin for binding to microtubules (Hagiwara et al., 1994, Wagner et al., 1996), and phosphorylation of tau results in its detachment from microtubules, which causes destabilisation of the microtubule cytoskeleton (Wagner et al., 1996).",

Altered mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, whereby the contents of damaged mitochondria are either \u2018diluted\u2019 via fusion and fission with healthy mitochondria or are cleared via mitoautophagy, are also implicated in HD (Shirendeb et al., 2011) and PD (Vives-Bauza and Przedborski, 2011).

In most NDDs elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is observed in either neurons or glia. Mutations in PS and Htt alter endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ content (Leissring et al., 2000, Vidal et al., 2011), and both A\u03b2 and \u03b1-synuclein increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations by promoting mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation (Gibson et al., 2008, Parihar et al., 2008). In AD, cytosolic Ca2+ content is elevated by the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, A\u03b2-induced Ca2+ influx through native ion channels, pumps, receptors, and/or as a result of membrane thinning or amyloid pore formation (Small, 2009). Similarly, in ALS the sustained excitotoxicity leading to motor neuron loss is likely mediated by Ca2+ influx through Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (Van Damme et al., 2005), subsequent ER Ca2+ depletion (Grosskreutz et al., 2010) and/or altered mitochondrial Ca2+-content (Carriedo et al., 2000, De Vos et al., 2011).",

However, the contribution of astrocytes during neurodegeneration is likely two-pronged, since a protective influence of wild-type astrocyte transplantation into the brain of mouse models of AD has been reported (Hampton et al., 2010). Similarly, in mouse models of AD, microglial infiltration to regions of plaque deposition may be protective through their phagocytosis of accumulated A( (Simard et al., 2006), at least in younger animals (Hickman et al., 2008). However, neuronal loss also results from increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production by microglia in models of AD (Hickman et al., 2008). The potentially toxic influence of microglia during ALS progression is believed to be T-cell dependent, and also appears to involve the increased expression of several inflammatory cytokines (Beers et al., 2008).",

In addition, several mutations in the MAPT gene that cause the onset of frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism associated with tau mutations on chromosome 17 (FTDP-7T) alter the alternative splicing of tau exon 10, which encodes a repeat domain important for the binding of tau to microtubules (Rademakers and Hutton, 2007).",

            "text": "Until recently, attempts to identify gene regulatory programmes during neural development have largely focussed on identifying transcription factors, and understanding their ability to regulate gene expression by sequence specific targeting of genes (Guillemot et al., 2006). However in recent years it has been demonstrated that ncRNAs are also key players in neurodevelopment. The first inkling of this came in early studies on the regulated non-coding transcriptome in the developing rodent nervous system (Sempere et al., 2004, Mercer et al., 2008). These studies have invariably demonstrated, with increasing levels of sophistication, that widespread transcription of ncRNA both long and short takes place in the developing mammalian brain, usually with complex spatial and temporal dynamics. Studies began with individual cloning efforts on human and mouse tissues, discovering some of the most highly expressed miRNAs (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002). Amongst these were examples that would become archetypal neuronal specific miRNAs, such as mir-9, mir-29 and mir-124. Soon after, microarray profiling revealed enormous diversity of microRNA expression in the brain (Krichevsky et al., 2003, Sempere et al., 2004, Smirnova et al., 2005, Bak et al., 2008). Not only are individual miRNAs expressed at particular developmental time points, but also within different subregions of the brain. Most recently, next generation sequencing (NGS) methods have afforded the deepest yet view of the small RNA transcriptome of the brain, confirming the unparalleled richness of this organ (Landgraf et al., 2007). These studies have allowed us to identify a set of miRNAs that are strongly associated with the brain. This has proved extremely valuable, not least because it seems that many of these neuronal specific miRNAs also play roles in a wide range of neuropathologies. Studies in human and mouse generally show that orthologous miRNAs have similar expression profiles (Sempere et al., 2004). Far less is presently known about other classes of small RNAs, but they are also likely to have similar behaviour. This is true at least for snoRNAs, where many neuronal specific cases have been found (Leung et al., 2009) and some are associated with mutations that cause behavioural phenotypes (Sahoo et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Research into long ncRNAs has lagged behind the miRNAs by several years, meaning that only recently have equivalent neurodevelopment expression profiles become available. In a landmark paper in 2008, John Mattick and colleagues profiled the lncRNA transcriptome in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (Dinger et al., 2008a). More importantly, they used a similar microarray to profile lncRNA expression during directed differentiation of neural stem cells to neurons and glia (Mercer et al., 2010). Not only are many lncRNAs upregulated during neurodevelopment, but many are also expressed in highly circumscribed neuronal populations within the mammalian brain (Mercer et al., 2008). LncRNA probes in existing commercial microarrays also detect multiple lncRNAs in the human brain (Michelhaugh et al., 2011). It is important to mention that many of the lncRNAs regulated in this way are associated with known protein genes that also have roles in the nervous system. For example, both the gene encoding the neurodevelopmental transcription factor Dlx1 and an antisense lncRNA overlapping it, Dlx1AS, are upregulated during the differentiation of GABAergic neurons (Mercer et al., 2010). Another Dlx paralogue, Dlx6, is contained within the intron of a well-known neuron-specific lncRNA, Evf2, which is transcribed from an anciently conserved enhancer region and functions as a transcriptional coactivator (Feng et al., 2006). More recently, we have carried out transcriptional profiling in human differentiating dopaminergic neurons, and discovered many hundreds of dynamically induced lncRNAs (Ng et al., 2012).",

There are many thousands of lncRNAs in the mammalian genome, and many can be distinguished by the presence of chromatin modification patterns of active genes (Guttman et al., 2011). We are beginning to see that substantial numbers of lincRNAs are expressed during neural development and in the mature brain. At present we have little direct information on the function of these RNAs, although it has been widely speculated that many of them act as scaffolds and nucleate and target epigenetic regulatory complexes that regulate gene expression in trans (Guttman et al., 2011). These include RMST, an approximately 2 kb transcript that is highly expressed in the developing mouse brain, and eye (Leung et al., 2009, Uhde et al., 2010). Interestingly, the human orthologue, called NCRMS, is regulated by paired-box transcription factor PAX2 (Bouchard et al., 2005). Given that PAX2 regulator of neuronal development in multiple regions of the nervous system and is conserved from fly to human (Huang et al., 2008, Shi and Noll, 2009), this would suggest that NCRMS is an important neuronal regulatory lncRNA whose expression is regulated by high level transcriptional programmes. An analogous situation is found for another neural specific transcript located in the DiGeorge critical locus is DGCR5, a deletion of which was found to underlie mental retardation in one family (Sutherland et al., 1996), and is regulated by the neural transcriptional repressor REST (Johnson et al., 2009b). In addition, the lincRNAs, Neat1 and Neat2 (Clemson et al., 2009) have recently been shown to be necessary structural components of subnuclear bodies (Sunwoo et al., 2009) that are upregulated during neuronal differentiation (Mercer et al., 2010).",

            "text": "So what are the functional implications of ncRNA expression during neurodevelopment? While this is an immature field, there is growing evidence that neuron-specific ncRNAs have indispensable roles in neuronal development. Although few mouse knockout models have yet been published, compelling evidence exists that loss of neuronal miRNAs has major impacts on brain development. The lncRNA Evf2, as mentioned above, is expressed from a highly conserved enhancer element at the Dlx5/Dlx6 locus. Originally discovered in rat, but also conserved in mouse, it apparently can function as a transcriptional cofactor to the Dlx2 transcription factor that regulates this locus during GABAergic development (Feng et al., 2006). Jhumku Kohtz and colleagues recently managed to knock out Evf2, generating an animal with reduced GABAergic signalling (Bond et al., 2009). The animals displayed reduced numbers of GABAergic neurons postnatally, resulting in adults with impaired synaptic inhibition. Another neural specific lncRNA is the imprinted Meg3 (Manji et al., 2006). It is capable of activating the p53 tumour suppressor gene, by an unknown mechanism (Zhou et al., 2007). The knockout mouse lacking Meg3 displayed a subtle yet clear phenotype of upregulated angiogenic gene expression in its brain (Gordon et al., 2010). Based on a functional genomics approach, we have recently found even more extreme phenotypes for loss of lncRNA during neurogenesis, at least in vitro, and have found at least four lncRNAs that are apparently indispensable for terminal differentiation of neurons (Ng et al., 2012). Another example is MIAT (also known as Gomafu and RNCR2), a neural-restricted lncRNA with orthologues in mouse and human (Sone et al., 2007). This nuclear-retained transcript was one of several ncRNAs discovered in a screen for genes involved in retinal development. Its loss, or even forced relocation to the cytoplasm, upregulates the production of amacrine cells and Muller glia (Blackshaw et al., 2004, Rapicavoli et al., 2010). Thus, MIAT appears to function in cell fate specification in retinal precursor cells, and this function depends on its nuclear localisation. It will be fascinating to find out whether MIAT is in fact involved in gene regulation.",

            "text": "Amongst the best studied ncRNAs in neural differentiation is the miRNA mir-124. This miRNA is massively expressed in brain, accounting for up to a half of all miRNAs in this organ at any time (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002). This high expression is accounted for by the existence of three distinct loci that express the miRNA. Further evidence for the importance of mir-124 in the nervous system is its conservation between human and mouse, and the fact that all three of its host loci appear to be regulated by the master neural regulator, REST (Conaco et al., 2006, Johnson et al., 2008). In recent years, a number of studies have investigated the roles of mir-124 in neurodevelopment, leading to the view that it functions by controlling several distinct gene regulatory pathways during this process. Studies from the Crabtree group have shown that ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes are key mediators of neuron-specific gene expression programs, and the composition of these complexes change dynamically during development. Mir-124 controls this switch, by switching expression of subunits characteristic of the npBAF (neural precursor specific form) to the nBAF (neuronal form) at the stage of terminal neuronal differentiation (Yoo et al., 2009). In addition to facilitating chromatin remodelling, mir-124 expression also switches genome-wide splicing patterns during neuronal differentiation. This is achieved through the downregulation of the non-neuronal splicing regulator PTB1 (Makeyev et al., 2007). In an elegant model, PTB1 itself promotes the nonsense mediated decay of its neuronal specific paralogue, PTB2. Thus, expression of mir-124 leads to a bistable switch from non-neuronal to neuronal splicing patterns. Mir-124 also directly targets transcription factors to facilitate terminal neuronal differentiation: the HMG-box transcription factor Sox9 is expressed in neural precursor cells, and prevents their terminal differentiation. Induction of expression of mir-124 thus facilitates terminal differentiation by repressing Sox9 levels. Finally, mir-124 is also capable of repressing components of the REST regulatory complex, which represses it and other neuronal specific genes in immature neuronal cells: mir-124 directly targets the small phosphatase SCP1, which is recruited by REST for repression of target genes (Visvanathan et al., 2007). Thus, mir-124 targets multiple distinct components of the gene regulatory network in undifferentiated neural cells to effect a switch to expression patterns characteristic of differentiated neurons. It is unclear whether other miRNAs behave in the same way. However, many of the findings with mir-124 are also mirrored by mir-9, in its ability to shift chromatin remodelling complex expression and the targeting of various transcription factors (Yoo et al., 2009, Shibata et al., 2011).",

            "text": "One numerous subclass of the lncRNAs are cis-antisense transcripts (Katayama et al., 2005). These are lncRNAs that are transcribed from the opposite (non-template) strand of the genome from protein-coding genes, and which have at least some exon-to-exon overlap. Such sense\u2013antisense pairs have been studied for some time, and it is estimated that the majority of genes have some kind of antisense transcript (Katayama et al., 2005). The functional consequences of antisense transcripts on the sense, protein-coding gene appear to be diverse, with cases of both positive and negative regulation reported in the literature (Faghihi et al., 2008, Annilo et al., 2009). There are presently several documented cases of antisense transcripts having important regulatory roles in neural development. The transcription factor Nkx2.2 is expressed in neural precursor cells where it promotes differentiation down the oligodendrocyte lineage. An antisense transcript to this gene, Nkx2.2AS, upregulates levels of the sense transcript, and thus promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation (Tochitani and Hayashizaki, 2008). Interesting, Nkx2.2AS also has significant antisense homology to other paralogous homeobox transcription factors from the Nkx and Hox families, suggesting that antisense may serve to regulate many genes. This is an important observation since it underlines that ncRNAs that act in cis may no be limited to regulation of one target. Other examples of antisense expression in the nervous system include negative regulation of Zfh-5 by its own antisense (Komine et al., 2006).",

We are not aware whether a strict definition requires the OT transcript to lie on the same strand as the protein coding partner, although in the case described here both indeed are transcribed from the same genomic strand. Importantly, the OT transcript and sense gene do not have any overlapping exonic regions. This distinction may be important, given that there is evidence that in the case of cis-antisense genes, the functional interaction may occur through RNA\u2013RNA hybridisation of the processed transcripts (Annilo et al., 2009). At least one OT transcript pairs has been described in the nervous system, both for the SRY-box type transcription factor, SOX2, involved in embryonic stem cell pluripotency and neural differentiation (Amaral et al., 2009). The OT transcript positively correlates in expression with the sense gene, although it remains unclear whether there is a regulatory interaction between the two, or if they are simply coregulated. Overall, overlapping transcripts are rather rare compared to other classes of lncRNA: in a recent analysis we identified 52 same-sense and 115 antisense OT-protein coding gene pairs, representing 0.35% and 0.77% of annotated lncRNAs, respectively (Derrien et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The first studies on transcriptional regulatory pathways that mediate synaptic plasticity were carried out by Eric Kandel and colleagues (Dash et al., 1990). These pioneering studies isolated the widely conserved leucine zipper transcription factor CREB (CAMP responsive element binding protein 1). Nuclear CREB is activated by synaptic activity, thereby binding to the regulatory regions of many other genes that it upregulates. Amongst the first evidence for ncRNAs in synaptic activity came with the discovery that CREB directly targets several miRNAs, including mir-132 (Vo et al., 2005). Not surprisingly, mir-132 is highly expressed in the mammalian nervous system, and is induced by synaptic activity (Nudelman et al., 2010). Functional studies showed that expression of mir-132 promotes neurite outgrowth, at least in part through the suppression of the mRNA encoding p250GAP (Vo et al., 2005). Consistent with this, mir-132 levels are upregulated in response to active synaptogenesis (Impey et al., 2004). Like other miRNAs, mir-132 is likely to function through multiple pathways, and evidence has been found for targeting of several other relevant genes including MeCP2 (Klein et al., 2007), which is an intensively studied gene regulator in neurons, and mutations in which are associated with the neurodevelopmental disorder, Rett's syndrome (Amir et al., 1999). In addition to mir-132, several other miRNAs have been shown to regulate synaptic structure and function: mir-125b and mir-134 (Schratt et al., 2006, Edbauer et al., 2010). In contrast to mir-132, both of these miRNAs negatively regulate synaptic function. Mir-134 is a negative regulator of dendritic spine size, through the repression of the mRNA encoding Limk1 (Schratt et al., 2006). Importantly, this interaction seems to be downstream of the neurotrophic factor BDNF, which relieves this repression of Limk1. Mir-125b acts by targeting the NMDA receptor subunit NR2A (Edbauer et al., 2010). Surprisingly, there is evidence from the aquatic snail, Aplysia, that mir-124, a positive regulator of neurodevelopment, may also function as a negative regulator of activity dependent modulation of synapses, possibly through repression of CREB mRNA (Rajasethupathy et al., 2009). Another microRNA, mir-138 also negatively regulates dendritic spine size (Siegel et al., 2009).",

Certainly, if the hypothesis that ncRNAs underlie the evolution of human cognition is correct, then we would expect them to be intimately involved in learning and behavior. At present at least two distinct cases of this have been described. The 152 nt RNA called BC1 was identified in the rodent brain more than two decades ago (Sutcliffe et al., 1982). This RNA Pol III-transcribed gene is localised in presynaptic terminals and is upregulated in response to synaptic activity (Muslimov et al., 1998) where it plays a key role in regulating activity-dependent translation of proteins. Specifically, BC1 inhibits translation by binding to specific translational regulatory proteins (Wang et al., 2005). Detailed functional studies have been carried out showing that loss of BC1 causes aberrant translation of synaptic proteins, including the fragile X protein FMRP (see Fig. 1\nand Section 5.1), resulting in hyperexcitability (Zhong et al., 2010). At a behavioural level, mice lacking BC1 display altered exploratory behaviour and increased mortality in open field survival tests (Lewejohann et al., 2004) and have elevated susceptibility to epileptogenesis (Zhong et al., 2009). There also exists an analogous primate-specific ncRNA transcript called BC200, which is also expressed in human dendrites and seems to interact with the same repertoire of proteins as BC1 in rodents, and is also capable of repressing translation (Martignetti and Brosius, 1993).",

The authors identified an additional expressed pseudogene containing antisense homology to both NOS1 and 2.

Intriguingly, this anti-NOS transcript is capable of hybridizing to and inhibiting translation of sense NOS transcripts, and is repressed during memory consolidation (Korneev et al., 2005, Korneev et al., 1999). It is also intriguing to note that an analogous antisense regulatory system exists in the human genome with the gene NOS2A (Korneev et al., 2008). There is also evidence that enhancer elements, long range regulatory elements that positively regulate gene expression, may function through the production of ncRNAs (Carninci et al., 2005, Ponjavic and Ponting, 2007, Guttman et al., 2009, Orom et al., 2010). The Greenberg group recently showed that when mouse neurons are depolarized, the resulting changes in transcriptional programs are accompanied by (and likely controlled by) the activation of thousands of enhancer elements. Their novel finding was that these enhancer elements are then transcribed into double stranded RNA molecules, termed \u201ceRNAs\u201d (enhancer RNAs), whose expression correlates with the induction of nearby target genes (Kim et al., 2010). The key question is now whether eRNAs are simply a byproduct of enhancer activation, perhaps due to non-specific transcription due to elevated recruitment of RNA Pol II following gene activation, or whether eRNAs are mechanistically required for enhancer-mediated gene activation. There is some evidence that the RNA molecule itself is, in some cases, necessary for the activation by enhancers, although further experiments will be required to demonstrate this conclusively (Orom et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the profound changes in ncRNA expression observed in depolarised mouse neurons is highly suggestive that they have some important role in activity-dependent genome regulation.",

            "text": "A major corollary of studies on the genomic basis of human brain complexity, is to understand what genomic elements underlie this complexity. This analysis relies on identifying function elements in the human genome that have arisen, or mutated under selection, since our last common ancestor with chimpanzees or other primates. For a variety of reasons, the general feeling is that much of the genetic basis of human-specific phenotypic traits, including cognition, lies in non-protein coding regions of the genome, since protein-coding regions have undergone little change during recent evolution (King and Wilson, 1975, Knowles and McLysaght, 2009). ncRNAs, particularly lncRNAs, appear to undergo rapid evolution. This may be due to the lack of strict nucleotide spacing and conservation that is necessary for an open reading frame. Rather, lncRNAs may function through modular secondary structure features that are less sensitive to mutations, insertions or deletions in the primary RNA sequence (Pang et al., 2006). Quite a number of studies have examined the evolutionary conservation of lncRNAs (Carninci et al., 2005, Ponjavic and Ponting, 2007, Guttman et al., 2009, Orom et al., 2010). While their exonic sequence is under far less selection compared to protein-coding exons, nevertheless they do have a significantly non-random selection when compared to neutrally evolving ancestral repeats, indicative of functional RNA. Intriguingly, lncRNA promoter regions are under selection almost as strong as protein-coding gene promoters (Carninci et al., 2005, Ponjavic and Ponting, 2007, Guttman et al., 2009, Orom et al., 2010, Derrien et al., 2012). These findings are consistent with lncRNAs being functional RNA products that have less constraint on their primary sequence. This observation, coupled with their widespread expression in the human brain, have led to the proposal that lncRNAs have been key players in the molecular rewiring associated with human brain evolution (Mehler and Mattick, 2007). This idea was given a significant boost by the work of David Haussler and colleagues in their 2006 discovery of Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1) lncRNA locus (Pollard et al., 2006). In a genome-wide search for human non-coding loci that are under significant positive selection specifically in the human evolutionary branch, the HAR1 cis-antisense non-coding gene pair (that is, two lncRNAs overlapping each other on opposite strands) had the strongest signal. Such regions of positive selection would be expected to include functional genomic elements that have contributed to the emergence of human-specific, adaptive traits including intelligence. Importantly, the elements investigated in this study, including HAR1, have orthologous regions in other species, but these elements have undergone a significant acceleration in evolution specifically after divergence of human and chimp. What was most intriguing was that when the authors investigated the expression of the HAR1F (forward strand) transcript, they found it to be brain specific in human and other primates. Closer examination showed it is also coexpressed with reelin in developing cortical neurons in both human and macaque foetuses. Thus, these findings provided the first candidate lncRNA that may have contributed to human specific neurodevelopmental processes. Follow up studies have shown that HAR1F folds into complex secondary structure, and that human specific mutations may alter these structures, presumably affecting the RNAs function (Beniaminov et al., 2008). It is important to state that subsequent studies have challenged the basis of nucleotide substitutions occurring in HAR1, and at present this debate remains unresolved (Galtier and Duret, 2007). Interestingly, not only has the sequence of HAR1 itself undergone evolutionary change, but also the regulatory pathways controlling its expression: while studying the regulation of this gene by the neural repressor protein REST, we found that this regulation is not conserved (Johnson et al., 2010). While human HAR1 is controlled by proximal REST binding sites, the mouse orthologue shows little evidence of such regulation. Thus, neural-specific regulatory evolution of lncRNAs may also evolve rapidly (Johnson et al., 2009a).",

In a microarray screen of postmortem brains, mir-107 was shown to be down-regulated in AD brains (Wang et al., 2008b). Interestingly, its expression was down-regulated even in early stage patients, suggesting that it may play a causative role in pathology. Most importantly, the authors showed that mir-107 targets the BACE1 mRNA, supplying a plausible mechanism for the upregulation of this gene. Another likely regulator of BACE1 is the miRNA cluster mir-29a/b-1, which is also decreased in AD (Hebert et al., 2008). In a separate study, it was found that the inflammatory brain response in AD may be regulated by another miRNA, mir-146a, which itself is controlled by the transcription factor NFkB (Ghose et al., 2011). The important downstream target here appears to be complement factor H (CFH).",

Moreover, loss of mir-133b seems to be an important contributory factor in PD. More recently it has been demonstrated that mir-34b/c RNAs contribute to the mitochondrial dysfunction phenotype in PD (Minones-Moyano et al., 2011). The neural specific miRNA mir-7 regulates levels of SNCA, making it a clear candidate in PD.

Together these data provide numerous, non mutually exclusive hypotheses as to potential ways that miRNAs may cause neurodegeneration in HD: either through the loss of one or several neuronal specific miRNAs which are necessary for maintenance of neuronal phenotype or else the wholesale loss of miRNA processing, which itself causes neurodegeneration (Schaefer et al., 2007).",

So far the best documented cases involve antisense transcripts to known neurodegeneration-related genes, although this is likely to be due to bias for practical reasons (since these transcripts, by virtue of their close proximity, have a clear a priori case for being regulators of those genes), and many more lncRNAs are likely to be operating in trans in these diseases. A clear demonstration again involves BACE1, a gene that plays a key role in AD. The group of Claes Wahlestedt showed recently that an antisense transcript to BACE1, BACE1AS, is widely expressed and is capable of up-regulating levels of the sense mRNA. Furthermore, BACE1AS expression is elevated in post-mortem AD patient brains (Faghihi et al., 2008). Interestingly, expression of BACE1AS itself is induced in response to A\u03b2, suggesting that a positive feedback mechanism may exist to drive amyloidogenesis. BACE1AS is also a promising candidate for therapeutic knock down using antisense locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides (Modarresi et al., 2011). There is also evidence that the BC200 RNA, the human analogue to the mouse synaptic-activity regulated BC1, is upregulated significantly and proportionally in Alzheimer's brain (Mus et al., 2007) although it remains unclear whether this phenomenon is a cellular response to cell death or contributes to neurodegeneration.",

Both transcripts are significantly upregulated in the brain of diseased mice. This is rather surprising, since lncRNAs are likely to be underrepresented amongst the genes included in the mouse microarrays used in this study, suggesting that lncRNAs have similar, if not higher probability of being altered in AD compared to protein-coding genes.

The authors used statistical methods to identify \u223c1000 genes and transcripts showing significantly different expression levels amongst Braak stages. Amongst unannotated transcripts in this set, we found at least eight lncRNAs (Fig. 2\n). These lncRNAs display a range of expression profiles, including some that decrease steadily during disease progression, others that peak sharply at intermediate disease stages, and others that increase with disease severity. Interesting, the two known lncRNAs amongst this set have both been previously implicated in neurodegeneration. The precursor transcript of the microRNA mir-9 peaks strongly at intermediate Braak Stage III, implying that the mature microRNA also increases in a similar fashion. Mir-9 has previously been shown to be repressed in Huntington's disease (Packer et al., 2008). The other lncRNAs is the Human Accelerated Region 1 transcript (Table 2), a neural-specific lncRNA of unknown function (Pollard et al., 2006), that was the first lncRNA shown to be repressed in Huntington's disease (Johnson et al., 2010).

Misannotated lncRNAs within conventional Affymetrix microarrays were reannotated, and significantly changing transcripts were collected. At stringent levels of statistical significance, this analysis identified four repressed and four overexpressed lncRNAs in HD. Consistent with the known role of the transcriptional repressor REST in this disease, the known REST target gene, DGCR5 is repressed in HD, suggesting that this lncRNA is downstream of REST in this disease (Table 2). Another predicted REST target, MEG3 is also repressed. Amongst the upregulated lncRNAs is the known lncRNA TUG1, which is a target of the tumour suppressor p53, which itself is a known transcriptional pathway in HD. An earlier study showed that both the sense and antisense Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1) transcripts are also repressed in HD (Johnson et al., 2010). It is unclear at present how many other lncRNAs are misregulated in HD, since the RNAs tested in these studies represent a tiny fraction of the known lncRNAs. It is of note however, that some of the HD-misregulated RNAs have also been implicated in behavioural disorders such as heroin addiction (Michelhaugh et al., 2011). The HTT gene itself is negatively regulated by a recently discovered antisense transcript, HTTAS (Chung et al., 2011). Furthermore, given the crucial role of BDNF in HD, it is worth noting that BDNF has an antisense transcript which may regulate it (Pruunsild et al., 2007). Of course these studies so far yield little functional or mechanistic insight into the roles of lncRNAs in neurodegeneration. However, given the emerging evidence that lncRNAs may serve as chromatin regulatory factors, it is tempting to hypothesise that their dysregulation may be responsible for the alterations in gene regulatory networks observed in these conditions.",

            "text": "One of the most fascinating class of neurological diseases are the trinucleotide repeat disorders. In the course of the past 20 years, a growing number of conditions have been linked to unstable expansions in repetitive DNA regions of various genes. Almost all the trinucleotide repeat disorders are characterised by severe neurological symptoms resulting from neurodegeneration (Everett and Wood, 2004, Anthony and Gallo, 2010b, Todd and Paulson, 2010). In almost all cases the condition results in death, and no therapies or drugs are yet available, although by their nature these diseases are attractive targets for various types of gene therapy (McBride et al., 2011). What is so compelling about these diseases is the fact that all of them result from a highly penetrant mutation at a single genomic locus. How can such a simple mutation give rise to such a slow developing and rather complex phenotype? All the trinucleotide repeat disorders are caused by mutations in distinct genes, which in general are ubiquitously expressed and do not have a function implicated specifically in the nervous system. In this case, why do all of them produce such a strong neurodegenerative effect? The ground-breaking studies demonstrating that various neurodegenerative conditions and ataxias result from such simple, and similar, genetic mutations offered hope that the neuropathogenic mechanism would also be simple. Unfortunately, the passage of time has showed exactly the opposite: that trinucleotide repeats are neurotoxic through a range of plausible mechanisms, and that each trinucleotide disease appears to exhibit various aspects of these mechanisms. In the following section we will attempt to summarise our current understanding of trinucleotide repeat diseases affecting the nervous system in light of recent findings.",

            "text": "By definition, trinucleotide repeat disorders (TNDs) result from variable sized expansions of unstable triplet repeats in the genome. In the majority of trinucleotide repeat disorders, that expansion occurs in a (CAG)n, which is translated into a polyQ (polyglutamine) tract. For example, Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the coding region of the first exon of the huntingtin gene (Htt), and spinocerebellar ataxia results from a similar repeat expansion in the Ataxin 7 gene. Initial studies on TNDs focussed on the affected gene, and how the polyglutamine expansion might lead to a toxic gain-of-function in the translated protein. What was clear was that mutant proteins had a tendency to accumulate in intracellular protein inclusions, and to have unnatural interactions with other proteins (Forner et al., 2010, Davranche et al., 2011). These inclusions tend to be populated by highly ubiquitinated proteins, and recruit other proteins with natural polyQ regions (Lee et al., 2004). The expression of transgenes containing polyQ regions alone, or fused to other open reading frames, is neurotoxic in both flies and mouse (Marsh et al., 2000). It has also been suggested that a loss of function of the mutated gene product also contributes to neurodegeneration. For example, the Htt protein has intrinsic neuroprotective characteristics, and polyQ expansion abrogates this function (Cattaneo et al., 2005). Similarly, loss of function in the Ataxin-2 protein has been the candidate mechanism in the cerebellar neurodegeneration in SCA2 (Lastres-Becker et al., 2008b).",

            "text": "However, a number of observations suggest that the combination of toxic gain-of-function of proteins, and loss of function of the wild type allele, is not sufficient to explain the disease mechanism. If loss of function is a general disease mechanism, why do mutations in such a diverse set of proteins result in a broadly similar phenotype? Furthermore, most of the proteins are ubiquitous, and not expressed specifically in the cell type that suffers neurodegeneration. Finally, transgenic mice lacking trinucleotide repeat associated genes generally do not recapitulate neurodegeneration (The Dutch-Belgian Fragile X Consortium, 1994, Nishi et al., 2002, Schmitt et al., 2007, Lastres-Becker et al., 2008a) although in the case of HD the knockout does display characteristic striatal neurodegeneration (Dragatsis et al., 2000). Therefore, we must suppose that some other underlying commonalities link these diseases. The most obvious of these is of course, the homopolymeric protein that is produced. As mentioned above, this is most often comprised of polyglutamine (polyQ), but some disease causing repeat expansions encode polyleucine or polyalanine (van Eyk et al., 2012). Importantly, many proteins in the genome contain natural polyQ tracts, and the fact that they are under demonstrable evolutionary selection strongly suggests that they serve some kind of function (Mularoni et al., 2010). Examination of the brains of human patients and animals models reveals the presence of nuclear inclusions that contain polyQ protein (DiFiglia et al., 1997). It appears that these inclusion consist not only of the disease-causing polyQ itself, but also other proteins that contain natural polyQ repeats. These include several transcriptional regulatory proteins, such as CBP, and have led to the hypothesis that trinucleotide repeat disorders are disorders of transcriptional regulation\u2014transcriptionopathies (La Spada and Taylor, 2003). Thus, the sequestration of polyQ containing transcriptional regulatory proteins will reduce their available concentration in the nucleus, and consequently lead to transcriptional dysfunction.",

            "text": "In almost all cases where experiments have been carried out on polyglutamine expansions either in vitro or in vivo, DNA constructs have been used that encode the polyQ protein (Mangiarini et al., 1996). Therefore, a major assumption is being made that the primary RNA transcript, from which the protein is translated, is itself not toxic. We now know that this is not always true. This was strikingly demonstrated in a fly model by Nancy Bonini's group (Li et al., 2008). In experiments on polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila, the authors found that the RNA binding protein MBNL1, a known player in neurodegeneration discussed below, enhances toxicity of a CAG-expanded SCA3 transgene. Surprisingly, when the authors then mutated the CAG-repeat region to contain interrupting CAA codons, thereby not altering the polyQ translated product, the authors observed strongly reduced mortality, neurodegeneration and behavioural changes. Furthermore, insertion of CAG repeats into the non-coding region of an unrelated marker gene \u2013 DsRed \u2013was still toxic. These results suggests that CAG expansions are toxic through at least two distinct pathways, one involving the production of a polyQ-containing protein, and another involving the RNA-sequence dependent properties of the CAG repeat, independent of gene context. In this regard it is interesting to note that HTT may have a dual function since HTT interacts with ribonucleoprotein particles in cortical neurons. In fact, there is a range of other evidence that trinucleotide expansion in non-protein RNA can give rise to neurodegeneration, ataxia, neuropsychiatric problems or mental retardation. Examples exist of expansions in 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 untranslated regions, introns, or ncRNA transcripts\u2013none of which are translated into any protein product (Campuzano et al., 1996, Davis et al., 1997, Holmes et al., 1999, Koob et al., 1999). One of the spinocerebellar ataxias \u2013 SCA8 \u2013 is caused by a CTG expansion in a non-coding locus that is transcribed on both strands into ncRNAs (Koob et al., 1999). Indeed, SCA8 is caused by CUG expansion in a non-coding antisense transcript, AXN8OS and expression of this transcript in flies causes neurodegeneration (Mutsuddi et al., 2004). Further, the myotonic dystrophies (DM1, DM2) are caused by expansions in non-coding 3\u2032 UTR and intronic regions, respectively (Brook et al., 1992, Ranum et al., 1998) while Huntington's-like 2 (HDL2) is caused by an expansion in the 3\u2032 UTR region of JPH3 gene (Margolis et al., 2001). Therefore, the production of a expanded, mutant protein is by no means a universal feature of trinucleotide repeat disorders. In the following sections we will discuss various evidence that such repeats function through either the production of a toxic RNA, or through direct translation of small homopolymeric proteins.",

In studying the toxicity of trinucleotide repeats, several curious lines of evidence have pointed to a role for antisense transcription in a number of diseases. In most cases, this occurs where a previously identified CTG repeat turns out in fact to be transcribed on the opposite strand into a CAG repeat. This was first discovered in the course of studies on SCA8, where a CTG repeat was mapped in the last exon of a non-coding transcript, ATXN8OS (Nemes et al., 2000). SCA8 belongs to the spinocerebellar ataxias, characterised by loss of physical coordination due to atrophy of the cerebellum, accompanied by loss of Purkinje neurons (Koob et al., 1999). Subsequently, Laura Ranum and colleagues produced a BAC mouse model, which recapitulated the intranuclear inclusions and neurodegenerative phenotype of the disease (Moseley et al., 2006). Mysteriously, brains of the knockouts also contained inclusions staining positive for the antibody 1C2, generally considered to bind to polyglutamine. Since polyQ can only be encoded by CAG, not CTG, the authors looked for an antisense transcript, which they subsequently identified (ATXN8).",

This disease strongly phenocopies HD with adult-onset degeneration of the medium spiny neurons of the striatum, resulting in personality changes, chorea and dementia (Margolis et al., 2001). Here the disease is caused by a CTG repeat, this time lying within a variably spliced exon that, depending on splicing patterns, falls either within a coding region (encoding polyleucine or polyalanine) or a non-coding region. The mystery of how this apparently weakly transcribed repeat causes disease was to some extent clarified by the demonstration that an antisense transcript also covers this region, resulting in a CAG-containing RNA (Wilburn et al., 2011). Similar to the above work on SCA8, the authors created a BAC mouse, and found that these mice accumulate intranuclear inclusions containing polyQ, originating from unexpected antisense transcription of the repeat region. These mice displayed the expected phenotype of selective neurodegeneration, reduced rotarod performance and nuclear inclusions. However, the authors took one step further and asked whether the sense CTG transcript was required at all for the neurodegenerative phenotype, by creating another mouse model where the sense transcript was silenced. These mice still display the HDL2 phenotype suggesting that indeed the principal disease-causing agent here is the antisense transcript. Furthermore, this transcript produces polyQ, which appears to dysregulate transcription of BDNF through the known CBP pathway. It is however important to state that, despite these findings, there is equivocal evidence supporting the toxicity of CTG transcripts in other situations.",

            "text": "Quite apart from their ability to encode toxic repeats themselves, antisense transcripts have been implicated in the epigenetic regulation of a toxic, sense transcript. This is best documented in a recent paper from the La Spada group, studying spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) (Sopher et al., 2011). SCA7 results from a polyCAG expansion just downstream of the initiation codon of the Ataxin-7 gene. SCA7 is rather unusual in that the usual cerebellar neurodegeneration is accompanied by macular degeneration (Del-Favero et al., 1998). This aspect of the disease would appear to result from altered function of the host SCA7 gene, which encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein (La Spada et al., 2001). Mutant SCA7 interferes with the normal transactivation function of the CRX homeodomain transcription factor, itself containing a natural polyQ tract, which controls numerous genes necessary for photoreceptor cells. It would appear that SCA7 transcript levels are controlled by a complex interplay between a non-coding antisense transcript which overlap the repeat region\u2014SCAANT1. The sense and antisense transcripts have highly anticorrelated expression, and the antisense transcript is driven by two binding sites for the boundary protein, CTCF. Importantly, SCAANT1 regulates Ataxin-7 transcript levels through a cis-mechanism, since exogenous expression of SCAANT1 had no effect on the Ataxin-7 gene. The expression of SCAANT1 results in repressive epigenetic signals in the Ataxin-7 promoter. Interestingly, CTCF regulation of an antisense transcription is also a feature of myotonic dystrophy (DM) type 1 (Cho et al., 2005).",

            "text": "There is now compelling evidence that toxic RNA repeats can act through gain-of-function interaction with RNA binding proteins. The general mechanism involves sequestration of RNA-binding splicing factors, leading to pathogenic changes in mRNA splicing in the affected tissues. The best known players in this are Muscleblind (MBNL1) and CUGBP1, two key regulators of splicing in the developing heart (Kalsotra et al., 2008). The relationship with MBNL1 is particularly important for CTG repeat containing RNAs. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by a dominant expansion in a CUG repeat in the 3\u2032 UTR of the DMPK gene (Carango et al., 1993). DM1 patients present with muscle wasting and sometimes cognitive impairment. The molecular mechanism appears to be well understood: The CTG repeat transcript sequesters MBNL1, reducing its effective concentration in the cell and resulting in altered RNA processing, principally splicing (Dansithong et al., 2005). Loss of MBNL1 most importantly switches the pattern of mRNA splicing from adult to foetal form in striated muscle. A secondary effect is the hyperphosphorylation of another RNA binding protein CUGBP1. This results in a dramatic increase of its protein levels, and increase of splicing regulation. A decrease in MBNL1 and increase in CUGBP1 function are characteristic of foetal muscle gene expression programs. Importantly, mouse models lacking MBNL1 suffer myotonia and missplicing consistent with human patients (Kanadia et al., 2003). The CTG expansion in SCA8 also results in MBNL1 sequestration and missplicing, suggesting that this may be a general property of all CTG repeat expansions.",

The authors showed that expression of untranslatable HTT retains its toxicity, at least in cultured human neural cells, and this is not due to repeat-associated non-ATG translation. These expanded CAG tracts are processed into small RNA species that are toxic specifically to cells of neural origin. The authors propose that these repeat-derived sRNAs are capable of acting as siRNAs to cause a generalized suppression of CTG-containing mRNAs via Ago2. These results must force us to reevaluate previous HD literature where mutant CAG-containing plasmids and gene targeting constructs have always been assumed to function through the expression of protein, rather than the RNA species that are also produced.",

            "text": "Understanding the transcriptome is essential for interpreting the functional read-out of the genome and revealing the molecular constituents of cells and tissues, and also for understanding development and disease. Transcriptomics deals with collection of all species of transcripts, including mRNAs, non-coding RNAs and small RNAs and focuses on the definition of transcriptional structures of genes, splicing patterns and other post-transcriptional modifications as well as quantification of the expression levels of each transcript during development and in association with disease. RNA-Seq is the first sequencing-based method that allows the entire transcriptome to be surveyed in a very high-throughput and quantitative manner (Garber et al., 2011). Transcriptome studies have been dominated by interrogation of microarray-based studies of coding genes inferred from genome annotation. However, this approach largely excludes the vast majority of lncRNAs and most short ncRNAs would have been size-excluded during probe preparation. The advent of RNA-seq has changed this. RNA-Seq offers both single-base resolution for annotation and gene expression levels at the genome scale at a much lower cost than either tiling arrays or large-scale Sanger EST sequencing and could be used to investigate the role of lncRNAs in patients affected by NDDs. The method faces several informatics challenges, including the development of efficient ways to store, retrieve and process large amounts of data, which must be overcome to reduce errors in image analysis and base-calling and remove low-quality reads (Wang et al., 2009). Once high-quality reads are produced, the main task of data analysis is to map the short reads to a reference genome (of healthy individuals), and assemble them into contigs before aligning them to the genomic sequence to reveal transcription structure (there are several programs for mapping reads to the genome, including SOAP31, MAQ32 and RMAP33 (Wu et al., 2006, Smith et al., 2008, Amaral et al., 2010, Cook et al., 2010). However, short transcriptomic reads exon junctions or poly(A) ends that cannot be analysed in the same way. For tissues in which splicing is less frequent, special attention only needs to be given to poly(A) tails and to a small number of exon\u2013exon junctions (Nagalakshmi et al., 2008). For brain, alignment is complicated by the fact that a significant fraction of sequence reads match multiple splicing variants (Mortazavi et al., 2008, Wilhelm et al., 2008) while databases collecting sequences of non-coding transcripts are becoming increasingly available (Wu et al., 2006, Amaral et al., 2010, Cook et al., 2010). A major goal is now to identify the protein binding partners of lncRNAs in order to understand their mechanism of action and to subsequently manipulate their interaction with their target transcripts. Twinned with this goal is the need to predict target transcripts and methods for prediction of interactions between proteins and RNAs are being currently developed (Perez-Cano et al., 2010, Bellucci et al., 2011a). These goals must be achieved if we are to investigate the interplay of these molecules and characterize their role in NDDs and ultimately target the RNA/protein and/or RNA/protein interactions for therapeutic benefit.",

            "text": "Antisense therapy is a form of treatment for genetic disorders and infections. When the genetic sequence of a particular gene is found to be associated with a particular disease, it is possible to synthesize a strand of RNA that interacts with the messenger RNA produced to inactivate the gene. In general, silencing of gene expression by RNA interference (RNAi) has proven to be a robust and straightforward technique for gene function analysis (Jackson et al., 2003, Machuy et al., 2005). Synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been widely used to transiently knockdown gene expression in cultured cells for loss of function (LoF) analyses. In mammalian cell models it has been shown that allele-specific silencing of disease genes with siRNA can be achieved by targeting either a linked single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or the disease mutation directly (Lapierre et al., 2011). For a polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorder, the SNP was employed to design a siRNA able to silence the mutant Machado\u2013Joseph disease/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 allele while sparing expression of the WT allele (Miller et al., 2003). In another experiment, a siRNA was employed to target a missense Tau mutation, V337M, that causes frontotemporal dementia (Miller et al., 2003). Taken together, these results indicate that siRNA can be engineered to silence disease genes differing by a single nucleotide and highlight a key role for SNPs in extending the utility of siRNA in dominantly inherited disorders. However, not all siRNAs designed with the currently available algorithms induce efficient silencing of gene expression. Pools of different siRNAs directed against the same gene are in general used to increase the probability of efficient inhibition of gene expression. Nevertheless, recent reports show that siRNAs may reduce the expression of unrelated genes (Jackson et al., 2003). Another potential difficulty in using RNAi for gene function analysis is the induction of the interferon (IFN) response (Sledz et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Inherited neuromuscular diseases are debilitating disorders with no effective treatments avialable to date (Daniele et al., 2007). Several therapeutic approaches involving RNA manipulation have been applied to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and Ullrich disease (UCMD). Following studies that provided proof of concept obtained from patients\u2019 cells and in animal models, clinical trials started and encouraging results have been reported. RNA-based strategies exploit knowledge of the molecular mechanisms associated with the genetic defects and the specific nature of the disease-causing gene and rely on three strategies (Le Roy et al., 2009): (i) Modulation of pre-mRNA quality through exon exclusion or inclusion. For example, deletion of exon 50 in the DMD gene is known to introduce a premature termination codon (PTC) in exon 51 of the DMD mRNA. Consequently, a truncated, unstable and non-functional dystrophin is produced leading to a DMD phenotype. The antisense oligonucleotide 2\u2032OMePS\u2013PRO051, targeting exon 51, induces specific skipping of this exon during pre-mRNA splicing and can restore dystrophin expression. The dystrophin produced is shorter than the wild type protein but is more stable, and partially functional, producing less severe phenotypes (van Deutekom et al., 2007). (ii) Modulation of mRNA quantity. In the case of Ullrich disorders, patients harbor a homozygous 26-bp deletion in exon 18 of the collagen VI (2 (COL6A2) gene that causes a frame shift mutation and introduces a PTC in exon 22. The resulting COL6A2 mRNA is degraded by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), which decreases COL6A2 protein levels and leads to disease. To re-establish a minimal amount of COL6A2 protein in fibroblasts from this patient, COL6A2 NMD can be blocked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Upf1 and SMG-1, two major players in the NMD pathway (Usuki et al., 2006). (iii) Modulation of mRNA translation. The DMD gene in the mdx mouse contains a nonsense mutation that leads to the introduction of a PTC in DMD mRNA and prevents production of functional full-length dystrophin. PTC124 is a chemical compound that promotes read-through specifically at PTC without affecting normal translation termination or cellular mRNA stability. This molecule induces nonsense suppression at the PTC in exon 23 and allows the translation of a full-length mutated dystrophin that is functional (Welch et al., 2007).",

            "text": "In addition, targeting pre-mRNA to influence alternative splicing may also have therapeutic utility. The microtubule-associated protein tau plays a central neurodegenerative role in AD and related tauopathies. Tau is encoded by the MAPT gene, which is alternatively spliced to give rise to six tau isoforms in the adult human CNS. There are two major classes of tau isoforms, with either three (3R) or four (4R) microtubule-binding repeat domains, and elevated 4R tau expression in AD and several related tauopathies is linked to disease pathogenesis. Therefore, correcting aberrant production of 4R tau isoforms may represent another disease-modifying approach for the 4R-dominant tauopathies (Gallo et al., 2007). Some promising evidence for this approach has been demonstrated in cell culture, although it is not clear how such techniques could be adapted for patients. In rat PC12 cells that express predominantly 4R tau, blocking access of the splicing machinery to tau pre-mRNA using antisense oligoribonucleotides that target the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 splice junction of E10, results in a relative reduction of 4R tau expression (Kalbfuss et al., 2001). Alternatively, tau pre-mRNA can be modified in cells using spliceosome-mediated RNA trans-splicing technology (SMaRT\u2122). A proof of concept study showed that this approach could be used to increase the conversion of 3R tau to 4R tau encoding RNA with approximately 30% efficiency (Rodriguez-Martin et al., 2005).",

It is true that the large majority of researchers see neurodegeneration as exclusively a protein disorder but this polarisation breaks down on two fronts. Firstly, it is illuminating to see how many mutant RNAs can precipitate pathology even in the absence of mutant protein, thus undermining the hegemony of protein-mediated pathology, and hinting at the potential for many as yet undiscovered toxic RNA species. Secondly, it is becoming clear that RNA itself cannot be thought of as simply protein-coding or non-coding and that a singular locus can give rise to transcripts that may be translated and not translated (Dinger et al., 2008b). This increasingly complex and subtle RNA landscape will influence our rationale for defining pathways and interactions to target for drug intervention. The ever-deeper sequencing of the human genome using current and emerging technologies will continue to expand the repertoire of ncRNAs. Hand in glove with this unveiling of the complexity of the genomic landscape there is an urgent need for a suite of bioinformatic tools that accurately and comprehensively predict DNA and RNA targets of ncRNAs, both short and long.",

At the very least, this expanded view of the importance of RNA, both protein-coding and non-coding, both small and large offers a host of novel of interactions to target that are distinct from the current focus on protein regulation of neurodegeneration.",

It has been shown that the N-terminus of Fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP interacts with the 5\u2032 of the dendritic non-translatable brain cytoplasmic RNA BC1 (Zalfa et al., 2005). The FRMP-BC1 complex interacts with targeted mRNAs that are translationally repressed (see ncRNAs in neuronal excitability and function). Computational methods such as catRAPID can be employed to characterize ribonucleoprotein associations, which will help unravel the role of non-coding transcripts in protein networks (Bellucci et al., 2011b): (A) In agreement with experimental evidence, catRAPID predicts the binding site of FMRP at position 150\u2013217.

Brains were staged according to Braak and Braak (1995) where Braak stage I represents early disease stage and Braak stage VI end stage disease. Amongst the 1071 transcripts found to be changing with statistical significance amongst seven groups of postmortem brains, we identified at least eight lncRNAs. In brief, we manually extracted likely lncRNAs from this set based on ID\u2014those transcripts with IDs commencing in ENST/BC/AK, or with the format \u201cC1orf1\u201d, then submitted their sequences to the coding potential calculator (Kong et al., 2007). Transcripts scored as non-coding (CPC score <0) were then manually checked. Any transcripts overlapping protein coding gene exons on the same strand, or immediately downstream of annotated protein coding genes (and therefore potential extended UTR regions) were discarded. We then used published normalised log2 expression data (Bossers et al., 2010) to plot the lncRNA expression level.",
