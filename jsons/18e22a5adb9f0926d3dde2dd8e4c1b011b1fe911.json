Thus, it is proposed that the expression of ACE2 is increased in patients with hypertension because of an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system, increasing their susceptibility to infection and complications by SARS-CoV-2, particularly in patients on treatment with either angiotensinogen-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs) [3] . However, at the present time, there is not enough data to discontinue the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with COVID-19, further studies are needed.",

The low prevalence of COVID-19 in children could be because of a better innate inflammatory response and a lower expression of ACE2 in the lower respiratory tract [5] .",
