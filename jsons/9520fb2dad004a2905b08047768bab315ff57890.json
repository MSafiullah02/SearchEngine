The Risk of Bias (RoB) assessment tool from the Cochrane Handbook was used to assess the methodological quality of RCTs [20] , and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of CCSs [21] . Each RCT was assessed at low risk, high risk, or unclear risk relating to the following items: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. The NOS assesses the quality of CCSs with eight questions in three broad categories: (1) patient selection; (2) comparability of study groups; (3) assessment of the outcome. The total score is 9, the higher the score, the better the quality of the study. Two reviewers independently completed the data extraction and quality assessment.

Considering heterogeneity of drugs used in different trials, we calculated all results based on the random effect model. We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each pairwise comparison with I 2 statistic, and value of <25%, 25-50%, and >50% considered as low, moderate, and high level of heterogeneity, respectively [22] .

This study found that Integrated Medicine can improve the disappearance rate of fever, cough, expectoration, fatigue, chest tightness and anorexia and reduce patients' fever, and fatigue time. This is related to TCMs can affect immune cells and cytokine production associated with immune responses [35] . Immune regulation maintains the homeostasis of the immune system, protects the body from sources of infection or other harmful substances, thereby alleviating the clinical symptoms. It is essential for normal health. However, we found that the outcome indicators were not uniform in the included studies. This situation is dangerous and increases the waste of research resources, may cause some ineffective or adverse interventions to be applied clinically [36] . The diversity of outcome indicators also exists in the laboratory indicators and the adverse reaction indicators. Although we found that the Integrated Medicine may change the inflammation index and have fewer adverse drug reactions than western medicine. But these are not enough, we found that many important indicators cannot be analyzed due to outcome indicators were not uniform. Such as Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, each Interleukin type, Macrophage ratio [13, 24] .",

Similar studies have shown that it has positive effects on lung infiltrate absorption in SARS patients [31]. Facing such a severe epidemic situation in the world, the Western countries should pay attention to the therapeutic effect of TCM. We think it is necessary to hire TCM experts to participate in the treatment of COVID-19 in Western countries. TCM has served the Chinese people since ancient times and has played an important role in today's medical care. And it especially has a very systematic understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of acute infectious diseases. And in TCM, the dosage, composition, treatment time, withdrawal and follow-up criteria, and treatment plan of the compound Chinese herbal medicine can be adjusted according to the situation of the patient. In the included studies, eight different herbal medicine or Chinese patent medicine were used. This means that in terms of treatment, TCM can make more choices to make the best treatment.

Till 27 March 2020, about 531,806 cases of COVID-19 and 24,073 deaths have reported [4]. The COVID-19 has posed significant threats to international health. So the effective prevention and treatment of COVID-19 are a very urgent task. As the first place where COVID-19 broke out, China has accumulated a lot of experience in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. So far, China has issued seven versions of COVID-19 clinical guidelines (Trial Version). According to the latest seventh edition, the treatments of COVID-19 still don't have specific medicine [5]. The treatment of COVID-19 involves multiple disciplines, and the current recommendations are mainly based on Western Medicine including supportive care, respiratory assisted ventilation, anti-infection (mainly antiviral agents), and glucocorticoid therapy [5]. Suggested antiviral agents are alpha-interferon (a-INF), lopinavir, ribavirin, chloroquine phosphate, and abidol. At present, there is no evidence to support the general or routine use of Western Medicine, nor is there any evidence to prove the risks and benefits of Western Medicine for COVID-19.",
