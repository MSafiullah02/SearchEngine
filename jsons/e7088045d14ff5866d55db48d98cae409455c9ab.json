Thus, applying Ocam's razor, we considered k to be essentially infinite, which parsimoniously reduced the negative binomial distribution to the Poisson distribution. Furthermore, we note that, in analogy to the case of pre-pandemic SARS, superspreading events may not be common in the transmission of MERS-CoV. Hence, we believe that our choice of a Poisson distribution for the number of secondary cases is appropriate for the MERS-CoV dataset that we used. It should further be noted that R 0 results obtained from tree sizes are quite robust to the choice of the distribution of secondary cases. The average tree size can be written in terms of R 0 as",

The change in the expected R 0 in both scenarios was less than 0.07, not significant when compared to the amplitudes of the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Second, we ran a sensitivity analysis based on the outstanding event of six secondary cases caused by patient C of the Al Hasa cluster in the dialysis ward [2] . Hence, removing this event, we re-evaluated R 0 under both scenarios. The main rational for these computations is that the outstanding transmission event might be unlikely to repeat. We found that the expected R 0 changed by very little (by less than 0.1 for scenario 1 and 0.01 for scenario 2), confirming the robustness of our results.",
