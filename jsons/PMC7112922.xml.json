            "text": "An animal model of retinal degeneration, referred to as experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR), was established using the coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), to examine genetic and host immune responses that may contribute to retinal disease (Robbins et al., 1990). Coronaviruses are large enveloped positive strand RNA viruses that cause prevalent disease in both humans and animals and have recently been determined to be the cause of SARS. Inoculation of retinal degeneration susceptible mice with MHV, strain JHM, by both direct (intravitreal, corneal scarification) and indirect (intracerebral) routes leads to retinal pathology (Robbins et al., 1991). In ECOR, mice are injected intravitreally, which produces a biphasic disease in degeneration susceptible BALB/c mice with inflammation in the early phase and retinal degeneration in the late phase (Wang et al., 1996). The early phase is characterized by the presence of infectious virus within the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), by infiltration of immune cells and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. This is followed by clearance of infectious virus to undetectable levels by day 8 post-infection (P.I.). The late phase is associated with a progressive loss of photoreceptors and ganglion cells, general thinning of the neuroretina and the production of retinal and RPE cell autoantibodies in the absence of infectious virus. In degeneration resistant CD-1 mice, only the early inflammatory phase is seen with viral infectivity titers and anti-viral antibody titers similar to those of degeneration susceptible BALB/c mice. Similar increases in viral and anti-viral titers between retinal degeneration susceptible and resistant mice as well as production of autoantibodies only in degeneration susceptible mice (Hooks et al., 1993) indicates that loss of retinal integrity is not due to viral amplification alone but also may be mediated in part by altered immune responses. We are now systematically evaluating host responses to the infection by studying cytokine, chemokine and adhesion molecule profiles. Recently we identified that IFN-\u03b3 is critically important in controlling virus clearance within the retina. Nevertheless, IFN-\u03b3 gene expression and production was similar in both resistant and susceptible mouse strains (Hooks et al., 2003). Since TNF-\u03b1 can play a prominent role in immune mediated disease, we evaluated this cytokine in ECOR.",

            "text": "TNF-\u03b1 is a pleiotrophic cytokine that exerts its effects through binding with its receptors TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1, p55) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2, p75) on the cellular surface. Functions attributed to TNF-\u03b1 signaling include both proinflammatory, such as cell proliferation of T and B cells (Pape et al., 1997), as well as anti-inflammatory processes, such as attenuation of T cell receptor signaling (Cope et al., 1997) and deletion of CD8+ T cells by interaction with both TNFR1 (Speiser et al., 1996) and TNFR2 (Zheng et al., 1995). Several studies have implicated TNF-\u03b1 in autoimmune diseases. In insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), signaling of TNF-\u03b1 via TNFR1 was shown by one group to contribute to \u03b2 cell toxicity (Kagi et al., 1999) while another showed that administration of TNF-\u03b1 delayed the onset and decreased the severity of IDDM (Jacob et al., 1990). In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), drugs that inhibit TNF-\u03b1 are routinely given to reduce symptoms (Cope et al., 1994). In a multiple sclerosis (MS) model it was shown that TNF-\u03b1 decreased disease severity in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced demyelination (Liu et al., 1998) whereas systemic lupus erthymatosis (SLE) may result from unregulated expression of the TNF-\u03b1 homologue zTNF4 (Blys, BAFF, TALL-1, THANK) (Gross et al., 2000). Although the action of TNF-\u03b1 seems contradictory, many of these studies do not consider the concentrations of TNF receptors present during disease. This may be an important variable since TNF receptors have been shown to interfere with the function of TNF-\u03b1, as well as prolong its activity.",

Based on these observations we next determined if increased sTNFR was associated with altered TNF-\u03b1 driven signaling events within the retina. We evaluated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), since the iNOS gene is controlled by TNF-\u03b1 signaling (Saura et al., 1999). At day 4 and 8 P.I. iNOS mRNA was only found in retinas of infected animals (both strains), but not in untreated or mock-infected animals, of either strain. In addition, gene expression of iNOS decreased from day 4 to 8 in BALB/c mice while it increased in CD-1 mice during this same time period (Fig. 6A). We confirmed these trends by performing densitometry on the blots using the public domain program, NIH image. The number of pixels was determined for each iNOS and actin band and these are expressed as a ratio for the virus-infected samples (Fig. 6B). The ratios confirm the trend indicated in Fig. 6A, namely that iNOS decreased from days 4 to 8 P.I. in BALB/c mice while it increased in CD-1 mice during this same time frame. Based on this data increased levels of soluble TNFR2 correlate with decreased levels of iNOS expression within the retinas of degeneration susceptible BALB/c mice. It is possible that soluble TNFR2 interferes with TNF-\u03b1 signaling within the retina.",

The levels of soluble TNFR2 in BALB/c and CD-1 mononuclear cells were measured by ELISA (Fig. 7\n). Unstimulated mononuclear cells obtained from BALB/c mice secreted significantly more sTNFR2 (p\n < 0.005) than those isolated from CD-1 mice. To further define the population of cells responsible for TNFR2 release, mononuclear cells were separated into adherent and nonadherent fractions. Adherent mononuclear cells (enriched for monocytes) from BALB/c mice released significantly more TNFR2 (p\n < 0.0005) than those from CD-1 mice. No difference was noted in the release of TNFR2 in the nonadherent cell populations between the two strains of mice. These data indicated that the adherent fraction of mononuclear cells were responsible for increased TNFR2 release observed in mononuclear cells from BALB/c mice. This suggests that release of TNFR2 from the monocyte cell surface may play a role in decreasing iNOS expression within the retinas of infected BALB/c mice.",

Although incubation of RAW cells with TNF-\u03b1, or sTNFR2 produced 45 and 50 \u03bcmol/l of NO, respectively, they were not statistically different from RAW cells alone (43 \u03bcmol/l) (Fig. 8\n). The addition of IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b3 plus TNF-\u03b1 significantly increased production of NO to 101 and 99 \u03bcmol/l, respectively, compared to control (p\n < 0.0000005). However, there was no significant difference between these two groups. This may be due to endogenous release of TNF-\u03b1 (2 ng/ml) by these cells. Upon addition of sTNFR2 to those cells which had been stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 alone or with IFN-\u03b3 plus TNF-\u03b1, a significant decrease of NO to 84 \u03bcmol/l (p\n < 0.005) or to 86 \u03bcmol/l (p\n < 0.01) respectively, was noted. Since these cells were noted to release TNF-\u03b1 constitutively we propose that sTNFR2 is decreasing NO by interfering with the signaling by endogenous TNF-\u03b1. Analysis of the mRNA from these cells showed that addition of sTNFR2 results in decreased iNOS gene expression (data not shown) suggesting that the decrease in NO was at the level of iNOS gene expression. These data indicate that sTNFR2 can interfere with NO production by macrophages via interference with TNF-\u03b1 signaling.",

Within the retina, TNF-\u03b1 gene expression may also be associated with neurons or glial cells since studies indicate that both cell types are able to secrete TNF-\u03b1 (Cheng et al., 1994). In this study, the detection of TNF-\u03b1 gene expression in the virus-infected retina and the absence of TNF-\u03b1 gene expression in control and mock-infected animals indicate that this response was virus triggered. Infected BALB/c retinas were found to have higher gene expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 early in the disease (day 4) and TNF-\u03b1 gene expression continued to be observed at day 8. In contrast, the gene expression of TNF-\u03b1 in CD-1 mice is evident at day 4 but not at day 8. Differences in serum TNF-\u03b1 protein expression were also seen between BALB/c and CD-1 mice. Protein levels in virus-infected BALB/c were, in fact, significantly higher (p\n < 0.005) than those of BALB/c mock-infected controls and were also higher than those of infected CD-1 mice at day 4. These results mirror the gene expression data seen at day 4 P.I. At later time points (day 8 in BALB/c and day 20 in CD-1 mice) we did not see a direct correlation between mRNA in retinal tissue and protein levels in sera. At day 8, lower levels of mRNA were detected in the absence of TNF-\u03b1 protein in the sera. At day 20 in CD-1 mice TNF-\u03b1 mRNA was detected in the absence of serum protein. This may be explained by the fact that mRNA was pooled from six to eight animals for RT-PCR analysis. This assay may have amplified low mRNA levels in a small percentage of animals. The TNF-\u03b1 protein analysis was performed on individual serum samples for the 5 animals. As is seen in Table 1, at day 20, 1 out of 9 sera from CD-1 infected mice contained TNF-\u03b1 in the serum. These studies indicate that during the acute phase of the disease, TNF-\u03b1 gene expression and protein production were not only increased but also sustained longer in BALB/c mice than in CD-1 mice.",

In diseases with an autoimmune component, TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to contribute to both the pathogenesis as well as the resolution of disease (O'Shea et al., 2002). Many studies however do not take into account the concentrations of sTNFRs present during disease that may alter TNF-\u03b1 signaling and therefore outcome. Here we have shown not only increased TNF-\u03b1 but also increased sTNFRs, specifically sTNFR2, during viral infection and have correlated higher concentrations with the development of ECOR, a disease in which anti-retinal antibodies are produced. Several studies have identified increased concentrations of sTNFR2 during viral infection (Bartholdy et al., 1999, Sippy et al., 1995, Marinos et al., 1995, Realdon et al., 2001) or autoimmune disease (StudnickaBenke et al., 1996, Heilig et al., 1993, Limb et al., 1999, Cope et al., 1992). Moreover, investigators have correlated increased sTNFR2 levels with increased disease severity either during viral infection (Godfried et al., 1995, Itoh et al., 1999) or autoimmune disease (Kulseng et al., 1999, Robak et al., 1998, Heilig et al., 1992). Here we link increased levels of sTNFR2 during viral infection with autoimmune reactivity. These studies indicate that sTNFR2 is important in the control of TNF-\u03b1 signaling and hence disease resolution.",

This occurs at the peak time of virus replication within the retina. Both TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 gene expression (Hooks et al., 2003) are detected within the retina at this time point. Several earlier studies have shown that increases in iNOS transcription can be attributed to signaling through TNF-\u03b1 to produce NF-\u03baB, and then through IFN-\u03b3 to produce IRF-1, which together have been shown to be necessary for iNOS transcription within the nucleus of macrophages (Saura et al., 1999). NO in high concentration causes damage in the photoreceptor layer of the retina in an experimental model of autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) and administration of TNFR-Ig abrogates this damage (Robertson et al., 2003). Therefore, it is possible that NO functions similarly in our ECOR model, predisposing BALB/c mice at an early stage to the progressive loss of photoreceptors seen during the degenerative phase of disease.",

Recently, it has been shown that overproduction of NO serves to limit the Th1 response in viral infection (Akaike and Maeda, 2000). This may be through the effect that NO has on NF-\u03baB activity. Connelly et al. (Connelly et al., 2001) showed that NO had a biphasic effect on NF-\u03baB enabling it to control host defense proteins such as iNOS, cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-6. In addition, low concentrations of NO have been shown by Niedbala et al. to increase the induction and differentiation of Th1 but not Th2 cells (Niedbala et al., 1999) by selectively upregulating the IL-12 receptor b2 via cGMP (Niedbala et al., 2002). Here we have shown that sTNFRs decrease the amount of NO released from macrophages. Therefore in ECOR overproduction of NO seen initially at day 4 may limit Th1 responses during the height of viral replication. In contrast the underproduction of NO at day 8 may increase the number and differentiation of Th1 cells at a time when disease is subsiding leading to the development of autoreactivity. This is not the case in CD-1 mice in which NO is initially low at day 4 and high at day 8 P.I. Therefore in CD-1 mice Th1 number and differentiation would be increasing during peak viral replication and decreasing as viral infection diminishes. These studies suggest that underproduction or improper control of NO may therefore alter Th1/Th2 responses leading to increased reactivity with cellular proteins and production of autoantibodies. This may be particularly relevant in ECOR, because MHV-infected BALB/c mice have been shown to develop anti-retinal antibodies (Hooks et al., 1993) while CD-1 mice do not.",

In our model, excessively released sTNFRs from macrophages could bind available TNF-\u03b1 thereby inhibiting apoptosis of activated T cells. This would increase the number of CD8+ cells within the retinas of BALB/c mice and thereby increase the likelihood of retinal damage via cytotoxic T cells. Evidence to support this possibility comes from immunohistochemical studies which show the presence of CD8+ T cells at later time points (20 days) in the retinas of BALB/c compared to CD-1 mice (data not shown).",

These factors may contribute to retinal degeneration in a multifaceted way. By one mechanism, the virus infects retinal cells and induces the production of NO that can directly trigger degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Using a second mechanism, the virus triggers sTNFR2 release that can directly modify T cell reactivity and autoimmunity. During the acute phase of the disease, both TNF-\u03b1 gene expression and sTNFR2 release are higher in the retinal degeneration susceptible BALB/c mice. Future studies will try to delineate between these two possibilities.",
