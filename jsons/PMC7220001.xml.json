He was diagnosed with a viral upper respiratory infection and sent home with supportive care. Six days later, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with continued fever and rash. Vital signs included a temperature of 103.0\u02da Fahrenheit, heart rate 115 beats per minute, blood pressure 93/54 millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 91%. Physical examination revealed a diffuse, morbilliform rash across the trunk and extremities, sparing the face (Images 1 and 2). There was no mucosal or ocular involvement. Chest radiograph revealed bilateral infiltrates consistent with multifocal pneumonia (Image 3). Labs included a normal leukocyte count (8300 units per liter [uL], reference range 4200\u20139100/uL) with an absolute lymphocyte count of 800/uL (reference range 1300\u20133600/uL). A C-reactive protein was elevated at 118.5 milligrams per liter (mg/L) (reference range 0\u20135 mg/L). A rapid strep test and an human immunodeficiency virus test were both negative, as was a respiratory viral panel. The patient required escalating amounts of supplemental oxygen during his ED course and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction test resulted positive on hospital day two. The patient remains hospitalized in the ICU on hospital day six.",

The rash was morbilliform, maculopapular, and nonpruritic, and appeared consistent with a viral exanthem. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been described in several publications, most thoroughly in a case series of 1099 patients by Guan et al. Fever, cough, congestion, and dyspnea are the most common presenting symptoms. Only 2/1099 patients were noted to have any skin rash, and the rash was not described1; no other publications have noted or described skin manifestations as a presenting symptom.1\u20135 Rash may be a rare presenting symptom of COVID-19 and should be kept in mind by front-line providers.",
