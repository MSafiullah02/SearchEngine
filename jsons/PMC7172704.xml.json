            "text": "Yellow head virus (YHV) from Thailand and gill-associated virus (GAV) from Australia have recently been classified in new taxa (genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae) within the Nidovirales (Cowley et al., 2000b, Cowley and Walker, 2002, Sittidilokratna et al., 2002, Mayo, 2002). The rod-shaped, enveloped virions of YHV and GAV are morphologically indistinguishable and each virus can be highly pathogenic for the black tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) (Boonyaratpalin et al., 1993, Chantanachookin et al., 1993, Lu et al., 1995, Spann et al., 1997). They also cause similar histopathology in diseased prawns and in situ hybridisation (ISH) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have detected infection in lymphoid organ (LO), gills, haemocytes, cuticular epithelium, nerves, eyes and in connective tissues of head organs and abdominal muscle (Boonyaratpalin et al., 1993, Chantanachookin et al., 1993, Lu et al., 1995, Spann et al., 1997, Tang and Lightner, 1999, Tang et al., 2002, Smith, 2000, Callinan et al., 2003). A chronic GAV infection state also occurs in which virus, originally described as lymphoid organ virus (LOV), is primarily observed by ISH and TEM in foci of hypertrophied cells or \u2018spheroids\u2019 within the LO of apparently healthy prawns (Spann et al., 1995). Chronic infections are highly prevalent in P. monodon captured from the wild or farmed along the Pacific coast of Queensland, Australia (Spann et al., 1995, Spann et al., 2003, Cowley et al., 2000a, Walker et al., 2001). There is also evidence of chronic GAV infection in healthy P. monodon broodstock and postlarvae in some regions of southeast Asia (Phan, 2001; T.W. Flegel, personal communication) and YHV infections have been described in healthy P. monodon farmed in Thailand (Pasharawipas et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Penaeid prawn species from Hawaii and the western hemisphere, including Penaeus stylirostris, P. aztecus, P. duorarum, P. setiferus and Penaeus vannamei, are susceptible to experimental infection with YHV (Lu et al., 1994, Lightner et al., 1998), and species farmed commercially in Australia, including P. esculentus, P. merguiensis and Penaeus japonicus, are susceptible to GAV (Spann et al., 2000). However, some age/size and species-related differences have been noted in their susceptibility to disease. Histopathology consistent with YHV infection has also been reported in P. japonicus cultured in Taiwan that displayed typical signs of severe white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) disease and appeared to be co-infected (Wang et al., 1996). In Australia, RT-nested PCR has detected GAV in low levels in healthy P. esculentus co-cultivated with P. monodon (Walker et al., 2001). There is no other published evidence of natural YHV or GAV infection in prawn species other than P. monodon although there are reports that small shrimp such as Palaemon styliferus and krill (Acetes spp.) (Flegel et al., 1997) and crabs (e.g. Scylla serrata) may carry these viruses. Nevertheless, the ability of YHV and GAV to cause disease experimentally suggests these viruses represent a significant threat to cultivated prawns.",

Of the antibody-based diagnostic techniques, immuno-histochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to a surface glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein of YHV (Sithigorngul et al., 2000, Sithigorngul et al., 2002) has recently allowed the detection and distinction of YHV and GAV infections (Soowannayan et al., 2003). ISH methods using DNA probes targeted to regions in the ORF1b gene have also allow cross-detection of YHV and GAV (Tang et al., 2002). RT-PCR tests reported to date have not considered genotypic sequence differences but have cross-detected YHV and GAV by chance (Cowley et al., 1999, Cowley et al., 2000a). To avoid the need for separate PCR tests to recognise YHV and GAV infections definitely, we describe here a sensitive multiplex RT-nested PCR that exploits genome sequence variations between reference Thai YHV and Australian GAV isolates to co-detect and distinguish these viruses.",

Experimental infections with the reference GAV isolate, which was derived from a farm disease outbreak in northeast Queensland in 1996, were conducted as described previously (Spann et al., 1997). Prawn tissues were collected at 5\u20137 days post-infection when cumulative mortalities had reached \u223c40%. P. monodon were also infected experimentally with a reference YHV isolate by injecting the tail muscle with haemolymph containing YHV (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1995, Wongteerasupaya et al., 1997). Lymphoid organs and haemolymph were collected from YHV-infected prawns 3\u20135 days post-infection. Prawns from farm outbreaks of YHV disease were collected from different locations in Thailand between 1994 and 1998.

However, some localised regions display higher levels of variation and virus-specific primers used in the differential RT-nested PCR were targeted to two of these sites. Regions targeted by the generic and specific primers are shown in Fig. 1\n. The site targeted by cDNA primer GY5 was conserved in three reported YHV sequences (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1997, Tang and Lightner, 1999, Sittidilokratna et al., 2002) and GAV (Cowley et al., 1999). GAV and YHV sequences at the site targeted by virus-specific primers G3 and Y3 varied at 12/24 nt positions associated with three aa changes, including one at the primer 3\u2032-end that was divergent at all three codon positions. GAV-specific primer G6 was targeted to a sequence that diverged at 10/24 nt positions, of which three occurred at the primer 3\u2032-end and were associated with one aa change. The extent of sequence variation was expected to restrict annealing of these primers to the non-homologous DNA template and mismatching at their 3\u2032-termini was included as two or more mismatches at this position severely abrogates PCR amplification (Kwok et al., 1990).",

Prawns were collected at different locations in eastern Australia or Thailand between 1994 and 1998 (Table 1). Among the GAV samples, less primary (794 bp) PCR amplicon was generated from the two cephalothorax homogenates than from LO tissue (Fig. 4a). In contrast, a high yield of 794 bp amplicon occurred only in sample YHV#1 and none was detected in five of the YHV RNA samples. Multiplex nested PCR (primer set GY2\u2013Y3/G6) generated a 406 bp amplicon in all 10 GAV samples and a 277 bp amplicon from all YHV samples except YHV#8 (Fig. 4b). Moreover, comparable yields of the 277 bp amplicon were generated from the former YHV samples irrespective of whether a primary PCR amplicon was detected. For the five YHV samples (#3, #5\u2013#8) in which little or no primary PCR amplicon was detected, the PCR was repeated using 2 \u03bcl instead of 1 \u03bcl cDNA. Increasing the input cDNA enhanced the 794 bp amplicon yield only for sample YHV#6 (data not shown). However, 277 bp nested PCR amplicon yields were enhanced visibly for most samples and an amplicon was detected for the previously negative YHV#8 (Fig. 4c).

            "text": "GAV from Australia and YHV from Thailand are viral pathogens that pose significant disease threats to the culture of P. monodon in countries that primarily farm this species. The viruses are morphologically indentical, induce similar histopathology (Boonyaratpalin et al., 1993, Chantanachookin et al., 1993, Spann et al., 1997), have similar tissue tropism (Tang and Lightner, 1999, Tang et al., 2002, Spann et al., 2003) and are readily cross-detected by ISH (Tang et al., 2002). However, the level of nucleotide sequence variation in the ORF1b (19.5%) (Cowley et al., 1999, Sittidilokratna et al., 2002) and ORF3 (25%) genes (Jitrapakdee et al., 2003) and antigenic variations detected with monoclonal antibodies (Soowannayan et al., 2003) indicate that GAV and YHV represent distinct geographic topotypes. Moreover, mortalities accumulate more rapidly in P. monodon infected experimentally with YHV (Boonyaratpalin et al., 1993, Spann et al., 1997) and, while YHV can induce cephalothorax yellowing in diseased P. monodon, whole body reddening has been reported for GAV (Spann et al., 1997). Nevertheless, these differences are subjective and/or observed inconsistently and would be unreliable in distinguishing between infections with the two viruses.",

The RT and primary PCR steps employ primers to conserved ORF1b gene sequences to amplify either virus, while the nested PCR employs multiplexed virus-specific primers to distinguish the viruses based on amplicon size. The two virus-specific primers incorporated 10\u201312/24 mismatches, including three at their 3\u2032-termini associated with amino acids shifts. The number and positioning of the mismatches precluded amplification of the non-homologous sequence as two or more substitutions at the 3\u2032-end of a primer have been shown previously to severely inhibit PCR (Sommer and Tautz, 1989, Kwok et al., 1990). In addition, the 23\u201324 mer PCR primers were used at an annealing temperature (66 \u00b0C) that would ensure specificity but accommodate minor sequence variations known to occur among different GAV and YHV isolates. As these crustacean okaviruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Cowley et al., 2000b, Sittidilokratna et al., 2002, Cowley and Walker, 2002) most closely related to those of coronaviruses and arteriviruses, it is likely that it will lack proofreading ability and establish virus quasispecies populations that are a source of genetic drift (see reviews Steinhauer and Holland, 1987, Holland et al., 1992).",

A non-specific product (\u223c400 bp) of similar size to the 406 bp GY2\u2013G6 primer amplicon was also apparent in these nested PCRs. However, this DNA did not occur in the multiplexed nested PCR incorporating both YHV- (Y3) and GAV-specific (G6) antisense primers in which its production was quenched by the preferential amplification of virus template.

However, when GAV RNA was diluted in 100 ng/\u03bcl YHV RNA and visa versa, the nested PCR detection limit of the minor viral RNA species (10 pg\u20131 ng) was found to be quenched 103 to 105-fold compared to that (10 fg) observed in the absence of competitor. We do not know to what extent the RT and/or PCR steps contributed to this anomaly. However, the effect was concentration-dependent. When 1 ng/\u03bcl rather than 100 ng/\u03bcl competitor RNA was used, the detection limit of the minor viral RNAs (100 fg) approached that obtained without competitor. Although there is obviously some dependence on virus loads, the nested PCR theoretically has the capability to co-detect and distinguish GAV from YHV in dual-infected prawns when relative RNA template numbers range between 1:1 and 1:104.",

All YHV samples were from diseased prawns while GAV samples were obtained from both healthy and diseased animals. There was some variability in amplicon yields among the YHV samples compared to GAV and these appear to be due primarily to the tissue type selected for RNA isolation. YHV RNA samples were mainly from haemolymph while LO was mostly used for GAV. YHV was not detected in one sample using the standard conditions. However, by increasing the cDNA quantity used in the primary PCR, and primary PCR quantity used in the nested PCR, a YHV amplicon was detected. The use of a published RT-nested PCR method has shown that nested PCR is often required to detect low levels of GAV in the LO of healthy, chronically-infected P. monodon (Cowley et al., 2000a and unpublished, Walker et al., 2001). Moreover, LO and gills appear to be a better source of GAV than haemocytes when infection levels are low (Cowley et al., 2000a). Unfortunately we were unable to determine whether this is also the case in the YHV-infected prawns as LO or separate gill tissues were not available for testing.",

These primarily occurred at codon wobble positions and, among the YHV samples, many were due to the presence of two different nucleotides in relatively equal amounts. This was not unexpected as most YHV RNA samples came from tissues pooled from 5\u201310 prawns and it is likely that individuals contained minor genotypic variants. In all YHV samples, sequences targeted by primers GY4 and GY5 were conserved. However, single variations due to co-infections occurred in either the Y3 or G6 nested PCR primer targets in 4 samples. Among the GAV samples, 1\u20133 nt variations were detected in sequences targeted by these nested PCR primers. However, these variations, including one which caused an A:C mismatch 1 nt from the 3\u2032-end of primer G6, did not adversely affect the performance of the PCR. This is consistent with data demonstrating that single primer-template mismatches (other than A:G, G:A, C:C or A:A mismatches at the primer 3\u2032-terminus) are unlikely to be deleterious to PCR (Sommer and Tautz, 1989, Kwok et al., 1990). In all, the absence of substantial sequence variations in the ORF1b gene region targeted by the multiplex RT-nested PCR suggests the test should be quite robust in distinguishing the Thailand YHV genotype from the GAV genotype that occurs commonly in healthy and diseased P. monodon from Eastern Australia.",

            "text": "Potential mechanisms for the inadvertent introduction of major prawn viral pathogens such as YHV, WSSV and Taura syndrome virus (TSV) into regions previously free of these agents are well documented (Lightner et al., 1997, Nunan et al., 1998). Of primary concern is the translocation of frozen uncooked prawns or live broodstock and seed carrying unapparent virus infections. The sequence divergence between Thai YHV and Australian GAV isolates suggests that introductions of these or genetically related viruses, could be detected and traced to the source of the introduction. The multiplex RT-nested PCR described here provides a rapid and sensitive initial tool to co-detect and differentiate these viruses. However, we are currently obtaining P. monodon samples from other locations in Australia and Asia to determine the extent of genetic diversity among YH-complex viruses present in different prawn populations (Walker et al., 2001, Soowannayan et al., 2003). Such epidemiological data will help establish whether these viruses are endemic or have been recently introduced through movements of brooders or postlarvae. Moreover, sequence information on different YH-complex viruses may allow development of a modified multiplexed RT-PCR test to co-detect and distinguish other genotypic variants of YHV/GAV.",
