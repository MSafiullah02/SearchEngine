            "text": "The etiologic agent responsible for the global outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) which occurred in the fall of 2002\u20132003 has since been identified as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Poon et al., 2003). Coronaviruses are a diverse group of large enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and domestic animals (McIntosh, 1974, Siddell et al., 1983, Lai and Holmes, 2001). Sequencing of the SARS-CoV genome has shown that it is genetically distinct from previously known members of the Coronaviridae family (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003) and that its nucleotide sequence is >90% identical to novel CoV strains now found in the Himalayan masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) (Guan et al., 2003, Martina et al., 2003, Lau et al., 2005). The close proximity of these mammals in live animal meat markets in southern China has suggested that the ancestral origin of the SARS-CoV may have come from a cross-species transmission of a coronavirus harbored in one of these mammals to humans. Although there have been no new reported human cases of SARS since 2004, the observation of closely related SARS-CoV-like strains still existing in animal reservoirs raises the possibility of a re-emergence of the SARS-CoV in humans. Due to this threat, development of prophylactics and viable vaccine candidates providing protection from the SARS-CoV are clearly needed.",

            "text": "Similar to other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV enters target cells by inducing fusion between the viral and cellular membranes, a process mediated by the viral spike (S) glycoprotein (Spaan et al., 1988, De Groot et al., 1989, Bos et al., 1995, Luo and Weiss, 1998, Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001, Simmons et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004a). The spike protein is a type-1 transmembrane protein. The spike protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor which for several CoV members is cleaved by a cellular endo-protease to generate two non-covalently bound subunits S1 and S2 (Frana et al., 1985, Sturman et al., 1985). In the case of the SARS-CoV S protein, it is believed that the S polypeptide chain is not cleaved upon release from infected cells but is cleaved during virus entry (Follis et al., 2005, Simmons et al., 2005). The S1 subunit of the spike protein forms a globular head and is responsible for recognition of the host cell receptor(s) (Taguchi, 1995), which for the SARS-CoV has been identified as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L (Li et al., 2003, Jeffers et al., 2004). The S2 subunit constitutes the stalk-like region of the spike and functions in membrane fusion. The sequence of the S2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide sequence, two characteristic 4\u20133 hydrophobic (heptad) repeat regions (denoted HRN and HRC herein), a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. These regions are responsible for membrane anchoring, oligomerization of the S protein into a trimeric state and fusion between viral and cellular membranes (Luo et al., 1999, Bosch et al., 2003, Bosch et al., 2004, Ingallinella et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2004, Tripet et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2004, Guillen et al., 2005). In the current model describing S protein function, S is thought to drive membrane fusion by coupling irreversible protein refolding with membrane juxtaposition. After binding to the host cell receptor, a conformational change is transmitted from S1 to S2 which causes the fusion peptide (a region of \u223c20 hydrophobic residues located N-terminal to the first heptad repeat region, HRN in S2) to be released from the interior of the molecule and inserted into the target cell bilayer (Hernandez et al., 1997, Damico et al., 1998). This \u201cmeta-stable\u201d fusion intermediate state is then followed by a further conformational change to a new low energy post-fusion state. Conversion to the post-fusion state involves a collapse of the two heptad repeat regions such that they now form a six-helix bundle, where three HRN helices fold into a central parallel triple stranded \u03b1-helical coiled-coil, and wrapped on the outside of this core is an outer layer of three anti-parallel HRC strands (Epand, 2003, Bosch et al., 2004, Ingallinella et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2004, Tripet et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2004). This post-fusion conformation displays the trimer of hairpins organization characteristically seen for other class I viral fusion protein domains such as HIV-1 gp41, influenza virus HA, and Ebola virus gp21 proteins (Bullough et al., 1994, Chan et al., 1997, Weissenhorn et al., 1997, Weissenhorn et al., 1998, Chen et al., 1999, Malashkevich et al., 1999). The structures of the S2 ectodomain in the six-helix conformation for both SARS-CoV and murine coronavirus MHV (a related CoV strain) have recently been reported (Ingallinella et al., 2004, Supekar et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004). The refolding of the HR regions into the six-helix bundle structure places the fusion peptide and the transmembrane domain in close proximity, thereby facilitating membrane pore formation and delivery of the nucleocapsid into the cell (Eckert and Kim, 2001, Epand, 2003).",

Indeed several groups have shown that immunization with the spike glycoprotein of several animal CoVs induces anti-S antibodies which provide protective immunity against the corresponding virus (Holmes, 2003, Navas-Martin and Weiss, 2003). More recently, several groups have now shown that immunization with the SARS-CoV S protein via inactivated SARS-CoV pseudovirus, vaccinia virus expressed S, recombinant S protein, or cDNA which encodes S, all elicit S-specific antibodies which appear to be neutralizing in small animal testing (Bisht et al., 2004, Bukreyev et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004b, Zang et al., 2005 and references therein). Despite their promising success, care and concern regarding the use of full-length S protein has also been advised. Although the sera of SARS patients have been shown to contain neutralizing IgGs against the S protein (attesting to the usefulness of a strong humoral response), other non-neutralizing S protein epitope-specific antibodies in these patients appear to have caused an auto-immune response, leading to enhancement of viral infection. When these auto-antibodies were analyzed in an in vitro system, they cross-reacted with lung epithelial cells and induced cytotoxicity, an event which correlates well with lung cytotoxicity observed in SARS patients (Lin et al., 2005). Also, immunization of SARS-infected ferrets with a full-length S protein vaccine exacerbated the liver damage caused by the virus (Czub et al., 2005). Additionally, the problem associated with antibody induced enhancement of disease has previously been observed for a feline coronavirus vaccine using the S protein of that virus as an antigen (Olsen, 1993). Thus, for these reasons, a SARS vaccine approach whereby full-length S protein is utilized may not be a safe and viable vaccine for humans.",

            "text": "An alternative to using full-length S protein to generate SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies is the use of small well characterized S protein epitopes. Small epitopes can be synthetically prepared, thus eliminating the problems associated with large volumes of live or recombinant virus. Any epitopes identified with adverse side-effects can be easily eliminated, producing a safer vaccine. Support for such an approach can be gained from recent studies of Zhou et al., 2004, He and Jiang, 2005 which have shown that monoclonal antibodies generated against a fragment of the SARS-CoV S1 domain can recognize epitopes in the receptor-binding domain and can inhibit viral entry by blocking association of the virus and receptor. In a similar vein, we hypothesized that antibodies raised against the heptad repeat regions (HRN or HRC) could also represent ideal epitope sites to produce neutralizing antibodies. These anti-HR antibodies could potentially target the exposed trimeric coiled-coils in the pre-hairpin intermediate state of S in a manner analogous to peptide inhibitors which have been shown to bind to type 1 fusion proteins and thus block the transition of the S2 domain into the post-fusogenic state preventing the formation of the six-helix bundle structure. Moreover, the amino acid residues on the surface of these coiled-coil regions appear to be highly conserved, a likely consequence of their importance in assembly of the fusion-competent structure, which suggests these amino acids may be more constrained in their ability to undergo antibody resistant mutations preserving the usefulness of the vaccine for recognition of both primary isolates and adapted SARS coronavirus strains.",

In the case of the SARS-CoV HR regions, each has been shown to exist in an \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structure (Bosch et al., 2003, Ingallinella et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2004, Tripet et al., 2004), and therefore the most effective display of the respective epitopes will be in an \u03b1-helical structure. To construct the HRN and HRC epitopes in a defined \u03b1-helical orientation, a novel two-stranded coiled-coil template strategy developed previously in our laboratory was used (Lu and Hodges, 2002). In this strategy, one selects the specific surface-oriented residues that constitute the epitope site and then incorporates these into the de novo designed two-stranded coiled-coil template sequence. This process is akin to grafting the molecular surface of one protein onto another. The template is designed with very high stability which ensures correct presentation, high solubility which facilitates peptide handling, and contains a small well defined epitope site making the elicited polyclonal anti-serum focused to a specific site on the protein. To date, the template strategy has been tested and shown to induce conformation-specific antibodies to several epitopes in heptad repeat regions which are reactive against their native proteins (unpublished data, S. Lu and R.S. Hodges).",

We have investigated their structural and immunological properties and determined the potential of the anti-sera to neutralize SARS-CoV infectivity. Our results show that all of the elicited anti-sera can specifically recognize HRN or HRC peptides and the native SARS-CoV S protein in an ELISA format. FACS analysis, however, showed only HRC1 and HRC2 anti-sera could bind to native S protein expressed on the cell surface, i.e., the cell surface structure of S precluded the ability of the HRN1 or HRN2 anti-sera to see their respective epitope sites. In in vitro viral infectivity assays, no inhibition was observed for either HRN1 or HRN2 anti-sera, whereas both HRC1 and HRC2 anti-sera could inhibit SARS-CoV infection. Interestingly, the HRC1 anti-serum, which was a more effective inhibitor of viral infectivity compared to HRC2 anti-serum, could only bind the pre-fusogenic state of HRC, whereas the HRC2 anti-serum also recognized the six-helix bundle conformation of the fusion state. These results suggest that antibodies that are more specific for the pre-fusogenic state of HRC may be better neutralizing antibodies. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that the two-stranded coiled-coil template acts as an excellent presentation system for eliciting helix-specific antibodies against highly conserved viral antigens, and show that HRC1 and HRC2 peptides may represent potential candidates for use in a peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV.",

In brief, the coiled-coil template (Fig. 1 top) consists of two peptide strands that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge via cysteine residues located at their N-termini. The disulfide link serves to stabilize the coiled-coil structure by maintaining the parallel in-register orientation of the two strands while removing the concentration dependence of the molecule. Each sequence contains Ile and Leu residues, respectively, in the corresponding a and d heptad repeat positions (denoted (abcdefg)n). The Ile/Leu residues are known to maximize the helical character and stability of a coiled-coil in these positions (Tripet et al., 2000). Additionally, the residues in these positions have been shown to determine the oligomerization state of a coiled-coil, and the Ile/Leu residue pattern is known to favor dimer formation (the oligomerization state desired in this case) (Harbury et al., 1993). Two arginine residues were added at the C-terminus of each strand to aid in the overall solubility of the molecule. The total length of the coiled-coil is 31 residues, of which 18 residues positions are available to be utilized by the epitope/antigenic sequence. These positions occur in the surface exposed b, c, e, f, and g heptad positions. Utilizing all 18 positions then allows for display of an \u03b1-helical epitope which encompasses seven helical turns in each helix. Finally, the N-terminus of one strand is acetylated while the second strand is extended two additional residues with norleucine and glycine residues. The norleucine/glycine residues act as a spacer between the coiled-coil immunogen and the site of conjugation to the carrier protein, while norleucine allows for easy quantitation of the peptide/carrier ratio after conjugation. At the very N-terminus of the extended strand was added benzoylbenzoic acid (BB). BB is a very efficient photo-activated cross-linker of synthetic peptides to carrier proteins (Parker and Hodges, 1985a, Parker and Hodges, 1985b, Ngai et al., 1994).",

The first, HRN1 (see Fig. 1 middle) corresponds to residues 921\u2013923, 925\u2013926, 928\u2013930, 932\u2013933, 935\u2013937, 939\u2013940, and 942\u2013944 (TTT-TA-GKL-DV-NQN-QA-NTL) of the SARS-CoV S protein. These residues are located along the exterior surface of HRN (Fig. 2\nA) and within its hydrophobic core which are now exposed on the surface of the template (T923, L930, N937, and L944). The choice for these residues coincides with those involved in forming, and flanking, the HRC-binding site on HRN as seen in the high resolution six-helix bundle crystal structure (Fig. 2 center). The second epitope site, HRN2, corresponds to residues 917\u2013919, 921\u2013922, 924\u2013926, 928\u2013929, 931\u2013933, 935\u2013936, and 938\u2013940 (QES-TT-STA-GK-QDV-NQ-AQA) of the S protein. This epitope site is similar to the HRN1 site, but contains only residues which are observed in the exterior surface positions of HRN (Fig. 2C) (i.e., no residues located within the hydrophobic core positions) (Fig. 1). These residues only flank the HRC-binding site on HRN. Thus analysis of the elicited anti-sera against these epitopes should evaluate not only the accessibility of the HRN coiled-coil region in the S protein but also whether HRN specific antibodies must directly compete for the same residues on HRN where HRC binds in order to block the conformational change from a pre-fusogenic to a post-fusogenic state or whether binding within the general area is sufficient for inhibition.",

Both of these epitope sites include the centrally located small helical structure observed in the HRC region when bound to the HRN coiled-coil (Figs. 2 center, F, and H) as well as residues which extend further either towards the N-terminus (for HRC1) or the C-terminus (for HRC2) of this site. In both cases, the residues chosen in the HRC region represent those expected to exist in the surface projecting b, c, e, f and g heptad positions of the trimeric coiled-coil.

The molar ellipticity at 222 nm ranged from \u221231 000\u00b0 to \u221235 000\u00b0 (Table 1\n) indicating the peptides exist in a fully \u03b1-helical state. The theoretical molar ellipticity for a fully helical 31-residue peptide is \u221234 070 (Gans et al., 1991). To assess the stability of the HR immunogen peptides, each peptide was thermally denatured and its change in structure from a fully folded \u03b1-helical state to an unfolded state monitored at 222 nm. As shown in Fig. 3B, all of the peptides displayed very stable thermal denaturation profiles. The temperature denaturation midpoints for the four disulfide bridged peptides were calculated to be >95 \u00b0C in benign buffer conditions (Table 1). Only when the disulfide bridge between the two-strands of the template peptides was reduced using dithiothreitol (DTT) could full temperature denaturation profiles be observed. Thus, the de novo designed \u03b1-helical coiled-coil template is more than adequate for presenting the incorporated HRN and HRC residues in an \u03b1-helical structure for immunization.",

Similar to that observed above, the HRN1, HRN2, HRC1, and HRC2 anti-sera demonstrated good specificity in recognizing the corresponding native sequence peptide which contained the epitope site versus the alternate HR region. The HRN1 and HRN2 anti-sera also showed a slightly greater ability to bind to the trimeric state of the HRN peptide (plated at a similar concentration to the monomeric HRN-BSA conjugate above) suggesting that conformation of this epitope site is indeed important for these antibodies to bind. The HRC anti-sera appeared to bind equally well to both HRC peptide conjugates (i.e., the monomeric and trimeric states). Titer analysis of each of the anti-sera also showed that each of the HR peptides elicited equally good IgG responses against the antigens and that all animals responded equally (data not shown). The estimated 50% titers (i.e., the dilution at which 50% of the antigen is bound using a concentration of 0.2 \u03bcg/well of antigen) for antibodies directed against HRC- and HRN-trimeric peptide conjugates (Fig. 4, panels B and C) were 0.6 \u00d7 105, 0.5 \u00d7 105, 1.9 \u00d7 105 and 1.2 \u00d7 105 for HRN1, HRN2, HRC1, and HRC2 sera, respectively. Finally, it is interesting to note that in the analysis of the specificity of the sera, we did see a very low level amount of cross-reactivity between the HRN and HRC sera for the different peptides. Because there is no sequence identity between the two HR regions nor the template peptide other than the 3\u20134 hydrophobic repeat, we can only surmise that despite the high stability of the template immunogen peptides in aqueous solution, a small amount of the peptides may have unfolded in the oil associated with the use of the Freund\u2019s adjuvant facilitating antibodies to be elicited against the coiled-coil core.",

In these experiments, biosensor surfaces were prepared with a surface density of \u223c50\u2013100 RU (response units) of peptide and a flow rate of 70 \u03bcl/min was used during analysis. Figs. 5\nA and B, display representative sensorgrams of HRN1 and HRC1 purified anti-sera binding to HRN and HRC trimeric peptides, respectively. Passage of the HRN1 and HRN2 anti-sera over the biosensor surface immobilized with single stranded HRN(916\u2013950) peptide showed no binding interactions at any of the sera concentrations analyzed (1.6 nM to 1 \u03bcM). The apparent absence of binding appears to be a consequence of the conformational specificity of the anti-sera, since the same sera displayed positive-binding sensorgrams when passed over a surface immobilized with covalently linked trimeric HRN(902\u2013950) peptide (Fig. 5A). The latter sensorgrams for each sera were globally fit using a simple 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model and the apparent rate constants (k\non and k\noff) and equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd) for the binding interactions derived (Table 2\n). For the HRN2 sera, fitting of the data showed a high-binding affinity (K\nd\n = 12 \u00d7 10\u22129 M) derived from a relatively fast association rate and a slow dissociation rate (k\non\n = 2.9 \u00d7 104\n M\u22121\n s\u22121 and k\noff\n = 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22124\n s\u22121). The ability of the antibodies to bind quickly to the trimeric HRN coiled-coils shows that the HRN2 epitope site is easily accessible and recognizable. In contrast, binding of the HRN1 sera showed a lower affinity (K\nd\n = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125\n M), arising from a slower association rate (k\non\n = 1.4 \u00d7 102\n M\u22121\n s\u22121) and faster off rate (2.1 \u00d7 10\u22123\n s\u22121). Since several of the HRN1 epitope residues selected were residues located in the hydrophobic core of the HRN coiled-coil (observed in the high resolution six-helix crystal structure; Fig. 2) it is tempting to speculate that the lower association rate arises as a result of these residues not being accessible in the folded trimeric coiled-coil structure but being accessible in the template coiled-coil immunogen. If so, this would suggest that the trimeric HRN peptide coiled-coil structure is similar to the HRN coiled-coil structure observed in the six-helix bundle structure (post-fusion state) and that this structure exists even in the absence of the HRC peptide (pre-fusion state). Regardless of the reason, the data clearly indicates that the HRN1 residues chosen are not as ideal as the HRN2 residues for generating high affinity antibodies against the correctly folded trimeric HRN coiled-coil.",

The fact that the HRC anti-sera can bind to the monomeric HRC state as well as it can bind to the trimeric state likely reflects the affinity of the antibodies and the propensity of the peptide to be helical. That is, an antibody with high affinity can induce monomeric peptides which are unstructured into a helical conformation (Lu and Hodges, 2002). Second, the HRC peptide (1151\u20131185) has a high propensity to form a helical structure as demonstrated by its ability to form a trimeric structure on its own (Tripet et al., 2004). This is in contrast to the HRN(916\u2013950) peptide which was observed to be in a completely random coil structure at all concentrations analyzed ((Tripet et al., 2004) and data not shown).",

To determine this, we carried out comparative binding studies. For the HRN anti-sera, we first immobilized trimeric HRN(902\u2013950) molecules to the surface of a CM5 biosensor chip and then passed HRC peptide over the surface to allow binding and formation of the six-helix bundle structure. Next, HRN1 and HRN2 anti-sera were individually passed over the surface and the amount of binding after a 70 s association phase recorded. Positive-binding sensorgrams were observed for both HRN1 and HRN2 anti-sera (data not shown). When the individual sensorgrams were compared to sensorgrams observed for the same sera binding the surface in the absence of HRC peptide, the data showed that both anti-sera retained the ability to achieve \u223c90\u201395% of HRN binding in the presence of the HRC peptide. Alternatively, when the anti-sera were allowed to bind first to the trimeric HRN(902\u2013950) molecule and then followed by addition of the HRC peptide, neither HRN1 nor HRN2 antibodies was able to be effectively competed by the free peptide (i.e., only a negligible drop, 5\u201310% in RU units, was observed upon addition of the HRC peptide).These same results were also observed in an ELISA format where trimeric HRN(902\u2013950) molecules were plated and HRC peptide added. The titration curves for HRN1 and HRN2 anti-sera showed only small shifts to higher antibody concentration for similar binding in the presence of the HRC peptide relative to titration curves observed in the absence of HRC peptide (Fig. 6\nA). Thus, despite the close proximity of the two epitope sites to the HRC binding site on HRN, the antibodies raised from these two epitopes appear to be utilizing mostly the exterior position residues on HRN for binding which are still exposed even after HRC binding (Figs. 2B and D). Further, these results suggest that these antibodies will be able to bind both the pre- and post-fusogenic states of the SARS-CoV S protein (if accessible).",

These experiments were carried out by performing indirect immunofluorescence experiments under non-permeabilized conditions. CHO cells were grown till confluent and then transfected with plasmid pcDNA3.1-SARS-S \u039419 (which encodes for full length SARS-CoV S protein but lacking the C-terminal 19 residues) 24\u201336 h was allowed for the S protein to be expressed and transported to the cell surface following which the cells were released from the plates, divided and incubated with HR specific anti-sera (1\u00b0) and then PE-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (2\u00b0). The ability of the HR sera to bind the cell surface S protein was determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and the results calculated as a percent increase in cell fluorescence relative to 2\u00b0 binding only of the transfected cells. Interestingly, despite the HRN1 and HRN2 anti-sera indicating an ability to bind to the soluble S protein and full length denatured S protein expressed in CHO cells for Western analysis, little or no binding was observed by the anti-HRN1 and anti-HRN2 antibodies to S protein expressed on the cell surface of CHO cells (i.e., no significant increase in the PE fluorescence intensity was observed relative to the mock transfected cells, Fig. 8\n). These results indicate that the native S protein conformation is such that the HRN coiled-coil, at least in the vicinity of the HRC binding site, is not accessible to antibody. In contrast, the HRC1 and HRC2 anti-sera clearly detected the native SARS-CoV S protein on the cell surface. Further, comparison between the two anti-sera showed that the HRC1 anti-sera was \u223c1.5-fold more effective at binding to the trimeric membrane anchored S protein. Since our earlier analysis had shown that the HRC1 and HRC2 anti-sera are almost equal in affinity and concentration, we would have to surmise that this difference in binding may be a function of slight differences in accessibility of the two sites within the HRC coiled-coil.",

For this assay, 50 PFU (plaque forming units) of SARS-CoV stock (Urbani strain, Accession No. AY278741) was mixed with serially diluted serum (31 \u03bcg/ml to 2 mg/ml total IgG) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and then added to Vero E6 target cells in 96 well tissue culture plates. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h , the supernants were removed and fresh medium was added. On day 3 after infection, the cytopathic effects (plaques) were recorded. As seen in Fig. 9\n, no virus neutralization was observed for either HRN1 or HRN2 anti-sera compared to pre-immune rabbit sera. This result is in agreement with the cell surface binding assay which also showed no ability of the anti-sera to bind to the surface expressed S protein. The neutralization result further supports the idea that the HRN coiled-coil (in the vicinity of the HRC binding site) is not accessible to antibody binding in its native pre-fusion state. In contrast, both of the HRC sera which did demonstrate S-protein binding on the cell surface did neutralize the infectivity of SARS-CoV. Moreover, titering of the individual anti-sera showed that the HRC1 antiserum was a far more effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV entry compared to the HRC2 antiserum, i.e., the HRC1 antiserum reduced the viral infectivity level to almost 0 above an IgG concentration of 0.5 mg/ml compared to 2.0 mg/ml for HRC2 antiserum (Fig. 9). Since previous analysis had shown that the two HRC sera were almost equal in affinity and concentration, the difference in virus neutralization activity must result from either a difference in accessibility of HRC in the native state S protein or the ability to inhibit progression to the fusion competent six-helix bundle state.",

The results showed that HRN1 and HRN2 anti-sera could bind concomitantly with the HRC peptide bound to HRN. It did not matter whether the HRC peptide was added before or after binding of the HRN anti-sera to HRN. These observations indicate that the binding sites on HRN for the anti-HRN antibodies and the HRC peptide are distinct, and that the presence of HRC bound to HRN does not even sterically affect binding of the HRN specific antibodies. In choosing the residues for the HRN antigens, we chose residues which existed in the exterior surface positions of the coiled-coil (Figs. 2A and C), and these residues are still largely exposed even in the presence of bound HRC (Figs. 2B and D) (Ingallinella et al., 2004, Supekar et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004). Although the HRN1 antigen did contain some residues which were located in the hydrophobic core of the HRN coiled-coil which would definitely be buried by the binding of HRC, it would appear that the anti-HRN1 antibodies do not utilize these residues for binding. Similarly, the HRC2 antiserum also bound to the six-helix bundle structure. The HRC2 epitope spans the middle and C-terminus of the HRC region (Fig. 1, Fig. 2G). The observation of continued binding of the anti-HRC2 antibodies to the HRC peptide in the six-helix bundle structure where the HRC peptide partially unwinds at either end (Fig. 2 center) indicates that these antibodies must be binding to the small centrally located helical region within HRC. Thus, despite the larger size of the antigenic peptide most of the polyclonal anti-HRC2 serum would seem to be focused only to the small central portion within the antigen site. In contrast, the HRC1 antiserum did not bind to the six-helix bundle state. The HRC1 epitope site spans the middle and N-terminus of the HRC region (Fig. 1, Fig. 2E). The absence of binding of this antiserum to the six-helix bundle indicates that this antiserum is clearly dependent upon the \u03b1-helical conformation of the N-terminus of the HRC region. This region of HRC adopts an extended conformation when bound to HRN. Thus, analysis shows that only the HRC1 antiserum appears to be uniquely sensitive to the fusogenic state of the S2 domain.",

Despite the observation that both HRN1 and HRN2 anti-sera bind to the trimeric coiled-coil HRN peptide, neither antiserum was able to bind to the cell surface-exposed trimeric S protein on CHO cells. This suggests that the HRN site (corresponding to residues 916\u2013950) is not accessible in the native pre-fusion state of S. In Western analysis, we observed the anti-sera could bind to the same S-protein produced in CHO cells when denatured, indicating that modification of the epitopes sites (e.g., glycosylation) was not a factor, but rather accessibility must be preventing binding. Interestingly, although we did see binding by the HRN anti-sera to the soluble S protein in an ELISA format, this binding could have been a result of a conformational change in S, (i.e., it is uncertain to what extent the S protein maintains its native state structure when immobilized on plastic). It should also be noted that the soluble S protein contained a lower amount of glycosylation than that observed for the S-protein produced in CHO cells, and the level of neighboring glycosylation could affect antibody recognition. Steric blocking by either glycosylation, the interhelical domain, the S1 domain or any combination of these regions could be responsible for the inaccessibility of the HRN site. It would seem appropriate that the S protein would hide the HRC binding site on HRN in order to prevent premature conversion from a pre-fusogenic to post-fusogenic state prior to binding of the ACE2/CD209L receptor. In contrast, both of the HRC epitopes elicited anti-sera which could react with the S-protein in the pre-fusogenic state. Thus, the HRC coiled-coil region of S is accessible. The binding of the two HRC anti-sera also suggests that the HRC region is not glycosylated. (i.e., there are two potential N-glycosylation sites within HRC (Asn-1155 and Asn-1176) which would have blocked binding had they been glycosylated). Further, the inhibitory effect observed for these sera also implies that the HRC region is readily accessible even on the virus envelope surface despite its close proximity to the viral membrane.",

            "text": "To determine if any of the HR specific anti-sera could block SARS-CoV infection, in vitro virus neutralization assays were carried out in Vero E6 cells. Our results showed that neither HRN1 nor HRN2 specific antiserum could inhibit virus entry. Thus the HRN coiled-coil regions analyzed did not show the potential for eliciting neutralizing antibodies. These results are in good agreement with recent studies by Duan et al., 2005, Keng et al., 2005, Lai et al., 2005, Lip et al., 2006 which have mapped the location of neutralizing antibodies generated from mice immunized with truncated sections of the S2 domain. These studies show no neutralizing antibodies corresponding to the HRN region. One possibility for the inability of the anti-HRN1 and HRN2 sera to neutralize virus infectivity is that the anti-sera were unable to bind to HRN because this site is inaccessible on the trimer (since we also observed no binding by these same anti-sera to the S protein in the cell surface binding assays). However, because binding assays on the live SARS virus were not carried out, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that the HRN specific antibodies do bind to the HRN region of S in the viral envelope but are just unable to block binding of the HRC region to HRN and thus prevent the S protein from switching to the fusion competent six-helix bundle state which drives membrane fusion and viral infectivity. It should be noted that two linear peptides, D07 and D08 which correspond to HRN residues 927\u2013937 and 942\u2013951, respectively, of the S protein, which overlap in sequence with the HRN1 and HRN2 antigens were shown to compete with cross-reactive antibodies in convalescent serum of SARS infected patients which induce a cytotoxic effect on A549 lung epithelial cells and are implicated in the auto-immune response leading to enhancement of SARS-CoV infection (Lin et al., 2005). Thus, the HRN region is not a viable region for vaccine development.",

It is tempting to speculate that the greater virus neutralization activity of HRC1 antiserum reflects its ability to arrest the S protein in the pre-fusion state, whereas the weaker virus neutralization activity observed for HRC2 antiserum reflects it inability to prevent progression to the six-helix bundle fusion-state because it can also recognize and bind to this structural state.
