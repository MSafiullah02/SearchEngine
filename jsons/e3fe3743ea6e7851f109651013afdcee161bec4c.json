The extant literature demonstrates African Americans, compared to whites, are far less likely to endorse a DNR and, in fact, have a preference for life-prolonging care. [3] [4] [5] For example, Mack et al. examined differences in end-of-life care among a sample of patients with advanced cancer. They found that African Americans were nearly three times less likely than whites to have DNR orders. 3 Medical mistrust and fear of receiving inadequate medical care are consistently hypothesized mediators for fewer DNR orders among African American patients. [3] [4] [5] During the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it is possible that despite patients' (and their families') wishes, medical personnel are making the decision of whether to apply life-prolonging measures. It is also possible that African American patients are disproportionately being encouraged to agree to a DNR.",

            "text": "This premise-that a patient would be encouraged to change their code status to DNR or would be otherwise denied lifesaving treatment because of their race-has precedence. Multiple studies support this supposition. Ezer et al. found that blacks had lower rates of lung resection (the definitive treatment for early-stage lung cancer), even after controlling for access to care, preexisting health conditions, and other demographics, including sex and socioeconomic status. 6 The study investigators inferred that the underlying bias of the surgeon who consulted for the lung resection may have contributed to racial differences in the rates of lung resection. Stated differently, the bias of the surgeon may have negatively impacted the course of treatment and subsequent treatment outcomes for African Americans. Another study found that blacks diagnosed with bone fractures were less likely to be prescribed opioids for pain control compared to white patients. 7 This study also found that black patients who were prescribed opioids were less likely to receive a concurrent prescription for naloxone, a commonly used reversal agent to prevent and reduce opioid overdose death. We surmise that implicit bias is the culprit. Implicit (or unconscious) biases are the stereotypes or preferences for or against groups of people that are held by individuals who are unaware of them and, as a result, are unable (or highly unlikely) to change. 8 This is distinct from the conscious thoughts and feelings that individuals hold about groups of people. Unconscious bias is most problematic because people are unaware that they have a preference for or against people based on factors such as race, age, or gender-to name but a few. A systematic review of studies assessing racial/ethnic implicit biases using implicit association tests among health-care providers was published in 2018. 8 Three major themes related to health-care providers' implicit biases and patient interactions emerged: (1) the majority of health-care providers demonstrated implicit biases against African Americans; (2) African American health-care providers demonstrated lower implicit biases overall; and (3) stronger implicit biases among providers were associated with worse patient-provider communication. 8 These biases often persist, even after accounting for patient-level factors.",

This alone will likely result in a smaller number of critically ill African American patients with COVID-19 being placed on a ventilator-a virtual death sentence. Admittedly, the health-care system was not prepared to handle the large influx of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overburdened providers are now forced to make tough decisions with scarce resources, and their unconscious biases will likely amplify the health disparities gap.",

The health-care system and all of its agents, policy makers, and elected officials are all accountable to ensure that our social and political determinants of health no longer disproportionately burden the groups most at risk for unfair or inequitable treatment but strive to deliver our systems best care.
