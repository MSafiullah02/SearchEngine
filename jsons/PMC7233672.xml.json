We are the closest (about 40 km) to the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy (Codogno, Lombardy). As such, we rapidly converted our facility into a hospital largely for COVID-19 patients. After this, we had to face two contrasting needs for patients who required cranial radiosurgery. On one hand, we had to treat patients with urgent intracranial pathology.[3] Notably, patients with brain metastases are at risk, as a delay in treatment would affect their long-term prognoses. On the other hand, we had to prevent our patients from nosocomial infection with COVID-19 that could become life-threatening.[2] There was a significant risk to these patients as our hospital was filled with over 300 patients being treated for COVID-19, as well as many healthcare workers who were likely carrying the virus while asymptomatic. Therefore, we decided to treat those patients by utilizing a treatment pathway that was still able to ensure patient safety.",

The second day, if all those exams and physical examination had ruled out COVID-19 infection and related syndromes, the patient was admitted to the GK center. After arrival, the patient washed his/her hands with hand sanitizer and stored in a locker all personal belongings. Peripheral pulse oximetry was placed to assess oxygenation status, and the stereotactic head frame was fixed. The patient was transferred to radiology procedural suit and back by traveling on a wheelchair. Stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging was acquired, and radiosurgery was performed with the Leksell GK Perfexion (Elekta AB instruments, Stockholm, Sweden). At the end of the procedure, the frame was removed, and the patient was discharged home. Finally, the GK and radiology rooms were sanitized and disinfected carefully.",

At the end of April 2020, the authors confirmed via telephone interview that none of these patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia and that all were still alive. The number of patients treated has been considerably reduced during the pandemic than routinely, as an average number of 40 patients is usually treated with GK radiosurgery per month at our center.",

It can be performed in outpatient setting as a single-session procedure, opposite to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, which requires between 10 and 30 hospital visits. Second, GK radiosurgery does not require endotracheal intubation or the use of high-speed instruments, lowering the risk of exposure to infectious aerosols and bone dust present in open surgical procedures.[2] Treating patients at their oncological reference center instead of being referred to distant centers is also relevant. As an example, we are able to make direct online comparison between a patient\u2019s latest brain imaging and stored exams/plans using the Leksell GammaPlan software (Elekta AB instruments, Stockholm, Sweden). This allows to distinguish new metastatic lesions from remnants of previous treatments or presumed radiation necrosis, as well as to make more accurate dosimetric prescriptions together with our radiotherapists and medical physicists. Finally, patients can be directly assessed by their personal oncologist while at their reference center.",
