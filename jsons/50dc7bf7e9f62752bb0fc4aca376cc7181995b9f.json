This progression is thought to be related to excessive increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels (1, 2).",

The cough that can develop with ACE inhibition is caused by increased bradykinin and its bronchoconstrictor effect, and montelukast, a selective LTD4 antagonist, has an inhibitory effect on bradykinin-induced airway hypersensitivity (5, 6) . Although it is unclear how this effect came about, it is thought to be through ACE receptors.",

ARDS, which frequently occurs in these patients, is an acute inflammatory lung injury, a clinical condition that is not well understood due to its complex pathogenesis, and is a result of widespread alveolar injury caused by intense inflammation. IL-6 and IL-8, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 produced in the early phase and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that occur in the later stages of the disease, induce leukocyte migration to the region. Then, leukocytes accumulating in the lungs are activated and secretive reactive oxygen species and proteases that damage capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium. Montelukast therapy has been shown in recent studies to reduce TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1b levels (3, 4) . The pronounced inhibitory effect of montelukast against bradykinin-induced tracheal smooth muscle contraction has also been demonstrated, which supports the interaction between bradykinin and leukotriene mediators (3, 6) .",

Also, CysLTs can affect cytokine production. In high doses and i.v. administration of montelukast, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 reduced protein expression in the lungs exerts its anti-inflammatory effect through the suppression of T-helper type-2 cytokines. Consequently, use of high-dose montelukast as an anti-inflammatory agent has been shown to be effective in acute asthma (7). In addition, the use of montelukast is known to have a decreasing effect on the frequency and severity of wheezing in patients with clinical episodic wheezing (wheezing after an upper respiratory tract infection caused by adenovirus, influenza, metapneumovirus, coronavirus). In these patients, montelukast does not prevent these viral infections, but seems to limit the upper respiratory tract (5, 8) .",
