Early reports from China suggested that neurological symptoms may be found in up to 36% of COVID-19-positive patients, with higher prevalence among more severe cases [6]. Helms et al. [15] reported that 84% (49/58) of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome had neurological symptoms including encephalopathy, agitation and confusion, and corticospinal tract signs. However, very little is known of the etiology of these reported neurological findings in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Potential possibilities include direct viral invasion, para-infectious mechanisms, secondary neurological manifestations of systemic organ failure, or coincident neurological dysfunction in the context of high SARS-CoV-2 population prevalence [16].",

To enter cells, coronaviruses must have their viral spike (S) protein bind to a cell surface receptor as well as S-protein priming by host cell proteases. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2R) for cell entry. Neurons and glial cells express ACE2R [24]. Meanwhile, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes express the serine protease TMPRSS2 required for SARS-CoV-2 S-protein priming [24, 25]. In one postmortem tissue study, Paniz-Mondolfi et al. [26] described viral presence in frontal lobe neural and capillary endothelial cells from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these facts suggest biological plausibility that SARS-CoV-2 may enter the CNS.",

However, evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain tissue specimens is lacking [2, 15, 29]. One case report from Japan identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient\u2019s CSF obtained 9 days after initial COVID-19 symptom onset [14]. However, nasopharyngeal swabs obtained at the same time were negative, raising the possibility of either a contaminated specimen or viral neurotropism that may exist independent of systemic involvement [14].",

Initially, many such reports were from verbal communications between colleagues or presented online in preprint form prior to scientific peer review. Of the peer-reviewed, published case reports/case series to date, most contain less objective/diagnostics data compared to pre-COVID-19 era, likely due to limitations related to COVID-19 containment and healthcare resource limitations in a pandemic. Reported SARS-CoV-2-related neurological syndromes include ischemic [34] and hemorrhagic strokes [3], Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome [4], a case of necrotizing encephalopathy [2], and a case of atypical presentation of COVID-19 in infants [35]. Nearly all reported cases of neurological dysfunction were in hospitalized patients. None have reported the underlying COVID-19 prevalence rate in the hospitalized patients at the times of these cases. Identifying neurological phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 may identify an important fraction of COVID-19 patients who have non-classical presentation with neurological symptoms, which may, in turn, change screening strategies. Infants, children, and adolescents may have very different SARS-CoV-2 presentations than adults. Understanding neuro-phenotypes is particularly important in the pediatric population, for which COVID-19 data have generally been sparse. Identifying post-infectious neurological events that can occur subsequent to the diagnosis and may impact long-term outcomes (e.g., cognitive, emotional, physical health) is equally critical.",

Inclusion of the latter category is justified for several reasons. First, testing availability differs broadly by location and center. Centers may have limited testing or repeat-testing capabilities for COVID-19 in patients with highly suspicious clinical syndromes. Second, laboratory COVID-19 test turnaround times for diagnosis vary significantly by location and center. At sites that require over 24 h for results to be available, patients could first enter the study by qualifying as COVID-19 PUI and later have confirmatory results. Third, COVID-19 test false negative rates vary by center. Patients with negative COVID-19 test results but highly suspicious clinical syndrome would remain as COVID-19 PUI and should be included. Finally, some patients who have undergone testing (and hence qualify as COVID-19 PUI) may die or leave the hospital before COVID-19 results are available. We believe that inclusion of COVID PUI subjects would therefore increase the sensitivity for case ascertainment. We will address the potential reduced specificity inherent in this approach by comparing primary and secondary outcomes in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients to PUI patients.",

For example, if both a virus and neurological syndrome are widely prevalent in a given population, the pathophysiologic link between entities becomes less robust. By the multicenter nature of this study, community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 will vary across sites. Acute neurological abnormalities may also arise as secondary injuries due to multi-system organ dysfunction associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, acute encephalopathic syndromes may be due to SARS-CoV-2-related renal failure, delirium may be due to prolonged intubation and sedation, stroke may be related to SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis, and myopathy and/or neuropathy may result from prolonged critical illness, neuromuscular blockade, or steroid use. Following Hill Criteria [45], if we are able to establish temporal relationships with infection preceding neurological symptoms, biological plausibility (e.g., biomarkers of a SARS-CoV-2-induced hypercoagulable state preceding an ischemic stroke), and consistent and strong relationships between SARS-CoV-2 infections and specific neurological syndromes, we will be more confident that we are observing a causal relationship. As a first step, we will characterize the phenotypes of neurological dysfunctions seen in COVID-19 based on rigorous clinical observations. Following this, additional laboratory, electrophysiologic, radiographic, and even histologic/tissue investigations can be used to investigate underlying pathophysiologic processes.",

The innovative and pragmatic study approach has allowed for rapid recruitment and activation of over 70 sites across the world\u2014an approach essential to capture real-time critical neurological data in adult and pediatric patients to inform treatment strategies in the context of a pandemic. The tiered structure of this study allows for an adaptive approach as diagnostic, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic data pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 evolves. This study methodology may serve as a template to guide development of future consortia.",
