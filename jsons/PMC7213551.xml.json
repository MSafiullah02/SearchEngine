To maintain glucose levels that are as much as possible within range, patients need to pay attention to meals, insulin doses, exercise regimens, working activities, social relations and psychological stress, as well as exercise self-control [3]. This continuous challenge results in people with T1D occasionally deprioritizing glycaemic control in favour of other activities [4]. Glucose control may improve during holidays, but this improvement is highly variable [5\u20137].",

In February and March 2020, Italy was the second most affected country worldwide [9]. To reduce the spread of infection, in late February 2020, the Italian Government issued a series of restrictions that, in March 2020, culminated in an almost complete lockdown of the country [10]. This lockdown intially involved all sport and educational activities but was then extended to commercial activities and most non-essential services. During lockdown, all citizens were requested to \u201cstay at home\u201d [11]. Outpatient clinics were closed while hospitals were coping with thousands of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic not only caused morbidity and mortality among people with CoV disease but also imposed a heavy burden on societal and population health [12]. It is expected that individuals with chronic disease, such as diabetes, will suffer the most from the prolonged lockdown due to limitations in access to outpatient clinics and services.",

The widespread use of the flash glucose monitoring system (FGM) among patients with T1D [13] has allowed healthcare professionals (HCPs) to monitor these patients through a web-based interface that records real-time sensor readings. Of note, telemedicine has been shown to improve psychosocial outcomes in young adults with diabetes [14]. According to a recent meta-analysis, FGM has the potential to improve overall glucose control [15] and to reduce hypoglycaemia in individuals with T1D [16, 17].",

Autonomic neuropathy was defined based on the results of cardiac autonomic tests performed with the Neurotester instrument (Meteda Srl, San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy), including lying-to-standing response, Valsalva manoeuvre, deep breathing and orthostatic hypotension. Retinopathy (any stage) was defined based on the analysis of digital retinography, as scored by expert ophthalmologists. Coronary artery disease was defined as a history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, or evidence of myocardial ischemia upon stress test (when available). Peripheral arterial disease was defined as a history of claudication or rest pain, peripheral artery revascularization or an ankle-brachial index of < 0.9. Cerebrovascular disease was defined as a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack or carotid atherosclerosis (symptomatic or asymptomatic).

Raw data were imported on a dedicated spreadsheet, and the following metrics were computed: average glucose with standard deviation (SD); coefficient of variation (CV%; expressed as the percentage of average glucose); time in hypoglycaemia (< 70 mg/dl); time in glucose range (70\u2013180 mg/dl); time in hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dl); and number of scans per day. As per convention, we set a cutoff of 150 mg/dl to define high/low average glucose and a SD cutoff of 50 mg/dl to define stable/unstable control. The primary endpoint was average glucose. These variables were calculated for each of the following periods (Fig. 1a): 3 months before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy; 1 week before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy; from the closure of sport and educational activities to lockdown of the Padova area, when commercial activities and non-essential services were closed (period 1); and the first week after lockdown (period 2).",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a huge challenge to public health worldwide [22], and healthcare services have faced severe challenges during outbreaks of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), resulting in major cut backs in the care provided to people with chronic diseases, including diabetes [23, 24]. Many outpatient clinics have had to change their routine interactions with patient and use telemedicine to monitor patients at home [25]. In Italy, the widespread use of FGM among people with T1D allowed these patients to be remotely connected to the clinic through the cloud. Diabetes professionals were concerned that glucose control could worsen during lockdown because of the limited possibility to exercise and the severe psychologic stress imposed by social distancing in a cultural environment heavily reliant on direct inter-personal relationships. During the outbreak, most non-essential activities were shut down, and most citizens stopped their usual working routine or turned to working at home. However, some people, such as those involved in healthcare or the food supply chain, continued to work during the lockdown. Our observation that glucose control improved during the first week of lockdown in people with T1D who stayed at home is reassuring and suggests that a slowing down of routine activities can have favourable effects on glucose control in the short term. Remarkably, the reduction in average glucose and the increase in time in range were not paralleled by an increased time in hypoglycaemia, which remained stable. We speculate that such an improvement occurred because patients had more time to concentrate on diabetes control and had a more regular lifestyle, including the timing and composition of meals, while not being exposed to workplace stress [26]. In addition, the knowledge that diabetes worsens the outcomes of COVID-19 [27, 28] may have improved patients\u2019 awareness and compliance to diabetes management.",

The observation that glucose control did not improve in this subgroup of T1D patients supports our interpretation. However, the groups of patients who stopped working and those who continued their usual working activities were not comparable because the latter had a better baseline glucose control than those who stayed at home, and > 60% were on insulin pump therapy. Users of pump therapy represent approximately 30% of patients with T1D at our clinic, and 13% of T1D patients nationwide [29]. The frequent use of insulin pump therapy among this group of patients is probably related to the fact that most were healthcare workers and/or shift workers who often need pump therapy to cope with their lifestyle and working schedules. Patients who continued working had a higher time in range at baseline, such that further improvements were more difficult to obtain. Yet, it is reasonable to assume that these individuals were subjected to stronger challenges during lockdown, including exercise limitations, social distancing, workplace stress, and fear of infection. Therefore, that these patients maintained good glycaemic control is reassuring in terms of their effective self-management of diabetes. We speculate that the use of FGM combined with insulin pump therapy contributed to this effect [30]; for example by limiting diabetes-related distress [31].",

Therefore, it remains unclear whether the same results would apply to patients with worse glucose glycaemic control or less frequent sensor scans. Finally, we did not analyse glycaemic control in the subsequent weeks of lockdown because most patients were remotely contacted by the physicians from the clinic with advice on how to manage diabetes, thereby introducing bias.
