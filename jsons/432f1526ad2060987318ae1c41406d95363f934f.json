The probability of a positive smear increases with the number of sites sampled. CSF should only be examined in cases where neurological symptoms or signs are present. If the chest radiograph does not suggest pulmonary involvement, bronchoscopy may be less useful. Bronchoscopy with BAL did not add significantly to the diagnostic yield, if all the other sites were also sampled [12] . Further concentration of samples prior to processing for smear may help to increase sensitivity. Fluorochrome dye-based stains are more sensitive than the routine Ziehl-Neelsen stain [13] . However, neither of these staining methods helps differentiate between tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacteria; further testing with nucleic acid amplification is required to achieve this [14] .",

The utility of ADA levels for diagnosis in areas of low prevalence and peritoneal fluid levels in cases of cirrhosis is still debatable. In pleural effusions, ADA was also found to be raised in empyema and rheumatoid disease. However, further studies have revealed that the increased ADA in TB effusion was mainly due to an increase in ADA2 levels, which was not the case with empyema and rheumatoid disease; measurement of ADA2 may thus improve sensitivity [17] . The sensitivity of ADA for TB is higher then a polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) based test, which has greater specificity in a high prevalence setting [18] .

Currently two tests, enhanced MTD (enhanced M. tuberculosis direct test) and enhanced amplicor M. tuberculosis test 2 (AMTD2), are approved for nucleic acid amplification testing in smear-positive and smear-negative respiratory specimens. According to FDA data, the sensitivity of the tests for tuberculosis (compared with culture) is approximately 95 % in patients with a positive AFB smear, but only about 50 % in smear-negative cases. Specificity is greater than 95 % in smear-negative and smear-positive samples. Although the FDA has not yet approved the use of nucleic acid amplification testing on non-respiratory samples, research has shown that nucleic acid amplification testing can be very useful in these samples, especially gastric fluid, lymph node biopsies, and skin biopsies [21] . However, nucleic acid amplification tests do not perform well with pleural fluid samples because pleural fluid has many inhibitors which affect the test, resulting in poor sensitivity. When TB meningitis is suspected without extrameningeal disease, nucleic acid amplification tests give a better yield than any other test, but experience with these specimens is minimal and they require special handling [22] . Nucleic acid amplification tests have poor sensitivity in smearnegative cases. A negative result does not rule out a diagnosis of TB. Most published data regarding the performance of nucleic acid amplification tests are based upon laboratory trials. These studies do not completely address their clini-Mycobacterial Sepsis and Multiorgan Failure Syndrome 535 cal applicability.

The initial regimen is for two months followed by a continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months. The choice of treatment in the initial phase is empiric and is based on likely susceptibility. Four drugs are used in the initial phase: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. In drug susceptible cases, rifampin and isoniazid are used in the continuation phase for 4 or 7 months. Directly observed therapy is the best way to ensure completion [26] . The recommendations for disseminated disease are the same as for pulmonary disease. A longer duration of therapy is required for miliary TB, bone disease, and in the immunocompromised. In the presence of TB meningitis, the duration needs to be extended to at least 12 month. Patients who show slow microbiologic or clinical response have high relapse rates and may benefit from extended therapy. The biggest challenge in patients with TB sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction is which drugs to give. Isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide have significant hepato-toxicity. In patients with no pre-existing liver disease and normal liver function, standard four drug therapy may be started safely. Anti-tuberculous therapy should be discontinued if the patient's transaminase level increases three times above normal with symptoms or five times above normal without symptoms [26] . The optimal approach to resumption of anti-tuberculous therapy is uncertain. Three new drugs (e.g., an aminoglycoside and two oral agents, such as ethambutol and a fluoroquinolone) could be started until the transaminase concentration returns to less than twice the upper limit of normal (or to near baseline levels) [27] . For patients with severe unstable liver disease who require a regimen with no hepatotoxic agents, streptomycin, ethambutol, a fluoroquinolone and another second line oral drug may be used for a duration of 18 to 24 months. Alteration in dosing of antitubercular therapy, particularly of ethambutol and pyrazinamide, is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency. Lengthening the dosing interval is preferable to reducing the dose in order to optimize peak serum concentrations. Administration of all anti-TB drugs immediately after hemodialysis facilitates directly observed therapy (three times weekly) and minimizes premature removal of the drugs. In critical care, it is important to administer pyridoxine with isoniazid in order to avoid isoniazid-induced neuropathy. Isoniazid can also cause cytopenias, which may be synergistic with other toxicities or co-morbidities in the critically ill. Rifampin is a potential cytochrome P450 inducer. It is essential to review the entire drug chart in patients receiving rifampin to anticipate potential serious drug-drug interactions. Ethambutol may cause irreversible optic neuritis.",

Because rifampin is the cornerstone of all six-month regimens, resistance to this drug requires prolongation of treatment [26] . Treatment of MDR-TB (resistance to isoniazid and rifampin) should be guided by drug susceptibility testing whenever possible ( Table 1 ). In many parts of the world, however, drug susceptibility testing is not available (at least initially), and empiric therapy must be used. The initial empiric therapy of TB in areas with a known high prevalence of MDR-TB or in patients who contract TB after contact with a patient with known MDR-TB, should include the standard recommendations plus whatever additional drugs are necessary to assure that at least four drugs effective against the most prevalent drug-resistant strains are included in the regimen [26] .",

In this scenario, the existing four-drug regimen should be strengthened, while waiting for results of drug susceptibility testing.

            "text": "With the increasing populations of patients with HIV or diabetes and the widespread use of immunosuppressive medication, we may see increasing proportions of patients presenting with TB sepsis in the years to come. With the various diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas surrounding TB, this may represent another menace in infectious disease management in the critical care setting. Many methods for fast diagnosis and newer drugs have emerged. But these methods have not gained widespread acceptance in health programs of countries with high disease prevalence. One of the biggest hurdles is the cost. With the greatest prevalence of TB in developing countries and among poorer populations, the focus should be on the development of cost-effective strategies and practical strategies of management. Ultimately, the major purpose of research is to develop solutions that can benefit the populations who need them most. The last decade has seen aggressive research in this field to address these larger issues also and it seems that we are just on the right track.",
