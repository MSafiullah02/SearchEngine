The market was immediately shut down on January 1, and environmental sanitation and sanitation were fully implemented. A few days later, after rejecting the diagnosis of seasonal influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, coronavirus, SARS, coronavirus, and other pathogens, on Jan. 1, the virus was declared a causative agent of the disease in four of the nine hospitalized patients: A new coronavirus that has a 5% genetic association with SARS and is a subset of Sarbecovirus [1]. Currently, the virus has been briefly named SARS-CoV-2 virus for further information and COVID-19, the name was given by the World Health Organization (WHO) to the SARS-CoV-2 virus-associated disease.",

According to a recent announcement of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), currently, there are no approved stem cell-based approaches for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection. However, recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have introduced one of the therapeutic approaches for using in the treatment of COVID-19 [2]. As we know, MSCs opposes viral infection due to the presence of specific cytokines improved qualities. These features are present in MSCs in the intrinsic niche before their separation process happens. Therefore, MSCs can be expected to survive even if they are transplanted into a patient with a confirmed COVID-19. Due to there is disagreement in MSCs therapy to treat COVID-19, we reviewed reported clinical trials and news to present helpful information to researchers and enthusiasts of the stem cell-based therapy field. In this study, we considered this proposed approach to improve patient\u2019s immunological responses to COVID-19 using MSCs and discussed the aspects of this therapeutic approach.",

            "text": "Several studies have shown that the first stage of the pathogenesis of this type of virus is the identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor by its spike protein [17]. For this reason, ACE2-positive cells are infected by this virus [17]. Another study has shown that the cellular protease TMRRSS2 is also required to allow the entry of coronavirus into host cells [18]. It is conceivable that the ACE2 receptor is widely distributed on the surface of human cells, especially alveolar type 2 (AT2) and capillary epithelium, and AT2 cells largely express TMPRSS2 [18]. On the other hand, interestingly, bone marrow, lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, and immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages are always negative for ACE2 (Fig. 1) [19]. These findings suggest that immunoglobulin therapy can help treat patients with the virus infection. Therefore, it should be noted that the capacity of the virus is greatly diminished by the cytokine-induced storm of the virus. The current hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is the cytokine storm in the lung. Virally-triggered acute cytokine release of GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, and TNF results in pulmonary edema, dysfunction of air-exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute cardiac injury, and leading to death [2].",

Among these, MSCs has attracted attention due to source potential, a high proliferation rate, low invasive procedure, and free of ethical issues. There is much superiority in using MSC therapy in comparison with other treatments [23], including in I) They are easily accessible and can be isolated from various tissues such as bone marrow and adipose tissues, including in umbilical cord, dental pulp, menstrual-blood, buccal fat pad, fetal liver, etc.; II) They are multipotent stem cells; III) MSCs can easily expand to clinical volume in a suitable period of time; IV) MSCs can be stored for repetitive therapeutic usage; V) Clinical trials of MSCs so far haven\u2019t shown adverse reactions to allogeneic MSC; VI) Safety and effectiveness of MSCs have been obviously documented in several clinical trials [23].",

But here these MSCs could recover the pulmonary microenvironment, protect alveolar epithelial cells, intercept pulmonary fibrosis, and cure lung dysfunction and COVID-19 pneumonia [25]. However, one of the main restrictions in this approach is the suppling source of clinical-grade MSCs and subsequently the speed of preparation for clinical usage that here stem cell banks can play an important role. Also, MSCs can be isolated from different adult tissues, including preferably bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB) and adipose tissues (AT) (such as abdominal fat, infrapatellar fat pad, and buccal fat pad) and neonatal birth-associated tissues, including placenta (PL), umbilical cord (UC), Warton jelly (WJ), amniotic fluid (AF), and cord blood (CB), and then stored for future possible applications. Therefore, it seems MSCs-based therapy may possibly be an ideal candidate for clinical trials or at least the combination of treatment to treat COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Recently, China, USA, Jordon, Iran, and several other countries have begun cell-based therapy clinical studies and some reports have been published (Table 1). Interestingly, one of the available methods to evaluate its efficacy in the maintenance or repair of damaged vital organs is the use of mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) therapy that widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease, spinal cord injury, GVHD and several other diseases specially with high immunity rates have been used [23, 26\u201328]. MSCs, using their immunomodulatory properties and their differentiation ability, can prevent lung tissue death by counteracting the cytokine storm and regeneration and reconstruction of damaged tissues (Fig. 2). Recently, the use of these cells in the clinical treatment of H5N1 viral infections that have similar effects on the lung has also been suggested [29]. In addition, recently a case study was reported in China on a female patient with an acute COVID19 syndrome that the results of laboratory tests and CT images provided extremely effective results after 21 days of treatment with umbilical cord MSCs. A recent case study of a case report of a 65-year-old female patient diagnosed in critical condition with COVID-19, then identified the exact 2019nCoV variant now called SARS-CoV-2 [30]. The patient had a neutrophil increase of 87% and a lymphocyte decrease of 9.8% and was treated with antiviral drugs such as lopinavir / ritonavir, IFN-\u03b1 and oseltamivir as well as intravenous injection of moxifloxacin, Xuebijing, methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin. The patient was also subjected to non-invasive mechanical ventilation to facilitate breathing and relieve muscle fatigue due to poor oxygenation. As the vital signs worsened, the patient was treated with cord MSCs alone and with \u03b11 thymosin 5 \u00d7 107 cells each three times. The results of the study showed that after the second injection, serum albumin, CRP, and ALT / AST gradually decreased, as well as other vital signs improved. Thereafter, the patient was removed from the ventilator and able to walk, and the number of white blood cells and neutrophils in the patient decreased to a normal level, while the number of lymphocytes increased to their normal level. Most importantly, CD3+ T cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell numbers were significantly increased. Also, the qualitative results obtained from CT images after the second and third injections of cord stem cells showed that the pneumonia was very relieved, 2 days after the third injection the patient was discharged from the ICU ward and most of the vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters in the They were normal. The results suggested that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells could be an ideal treatment option alone or in combination with other immune modulators for acute COVID-19 patients [30]. In another study released recently in China and in collaboration with the United States, 7 patients with COVID19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital from January 23 to February 16 underwent mesenchymal stem cell transplantation and clinical manifestations, changes in immune function levels [25]. Also, inflammation was assessed within 14 days after transplantation. The results showed that the clinical symptoms of all patients improved significantly 2 days after stem cell transplantation. Among the patients studied, one was very acute and two patients with milder conditions were discharged from the hospital 10 days after transplantation. Their results also showed that peripheral lymphocyte levels increased, activated cytokine-secreting immune cells, such as CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells and NK CXCR3+ cells disappeared on day 6\u20136. A group of CD14+ CD11c+ CD11bmid regulatory DC cell populations also increased dramatically. At the same time, TNF-\u03b1 levels were significantly decreased, whereas IL-10 was increased in patients treated with MSCs compared with patients treated with conventional therapy. In addition, gene expression profiling of mesenchymal stem cells showed that these cells are ACE2- and TMPRSS2-, which showed that mesenchymal stem cells are free of COVID19 infection [25]. Therefore, they concluded that MSCs would be safe and effective for treating patients with COVID19 pneumonia, especially for patients with very acute conditions.",

However, the cost-effective and speed of therapeutic preparation are the capable discussed topic for MSC-based therapy for COVID-19, but certainly, the life of a human is more worthy and COVID-19 is so dangers. Therefore, the clinical use of MSCs therapy to treat COVID-19 is still some time away, but there are some promising reports to apply.
