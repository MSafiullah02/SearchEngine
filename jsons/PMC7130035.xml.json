            "text": "Since the 1980s the epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been investigated by the application of many different typing or fingerprinting methods. To study the epidemiology of CDI, a typing method with a high discriminatory power, typeability, stability, power, reproducibility and epidemiological concordance is required. It should also have technical advantages, such as ease of performance, relative low cost, and high throughput. A growing number of molecular methods have been applied to C. difficile. For the early and rapid detection of outbreak situations, methods such as restriction enzyme analysis, arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and PCR ribotyping are commonly used. For long-term epidemiology, multilocus sequence typing, multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA), and amplified fragment length polymorphism are of interest.",

Conventional agarose gel-based PCR ribotyping is easy to use and relatively cheap, but analysis of fragment lengths is hampered by poor resolution. Recently, a capillary gel electrophoresis-based PCR ribotyping assay has been developed that significantly reduces the hands-on time required for C. difficile PCR ribotyping. The results were highly reproducible, independent of reagent batches or brands used and allows inter-laboratory comparisons of typing results.",

Recently, a new MLVA method was developed using smal short tandem repeats (2\u20139 bp) to facilitate automated fragment analysis with multicoloured capillary electrophoresis instead of sequencing. In a study using isolates from laboratories in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, seven C. difficile typing techniques were compared, but only REA and MLVA showed sufficient discrimination to distinguish strains from different outbreaks. MLVA has also been applied to study local outbreaks of C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 strains. MLVA is currently the most discriminative typing method and will contribute significantly to our understanding of the epidemiology of C. difficile.",

The hospital environment has very specific characteristics which are likely to be important determinants of infectious disease occurrence and transmission, such as clustering of susceptible hosts, increased possibility of environmental contamination, physical proximity and multiple person to person contacts. Similarly, the demographics of hospitalized patients population also differ significantly from that of the community. In hospitals, the prevalence of antibiotic use is very high, and highly correlated with many other factors which could be important in the expression of CDI. Until recently antibiotics were believed to be a prerequisite for the development of CDI but studies of community acquired disease are consistently describing disease occurring in a high proportion of patients who have no such exposure.

Covalent modifications of histones through acetylation at Lysine residues strongly influence the structure and the function of the chromatin. Whereas acetylation of histones results in a relaxed chromatin structure that is associated with active transcription, de-acetylation of histones results in a compacted chromatin structure associated with repressed transcription. Global histone acetylation is regulated by the opposing actions of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Beside histones, non histones proteins are modified by reversible acetylation, among which a-tubulin, HSP90 and transcription regulators. Therefore, HDACs impact on many biological functions, primarily cell differentiation, growth and survival. HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) were originally developed for their powerful anti-cancer activity. Yet, recent preclinical studies suggest that HDIs possess anti-inflammatory activity. Based on these observations, we postulated that HDIs could impact on innate immune response to microbial infection. Here we will discuss the results from our studies on the effect of HDIs on the innate immune system. We first performed genome-wide gene expression analyses to have a global view of the impact of HDIs on the transcriptome of resting and microbial product-stimulated primary macrophages. We then studied the influence of HDIs on key parameters (activation of the intracellular signal transduction pathways, production of cytokines and chemokines, expression of co-stimulatory and chemokine receptors\u2025) of macrophages, dendritic cells and whole blood activated by a broad range of microbial products. Finally, we analyzed the impact of HDIs in preclinical models of non-severe bacterial and fungal infections, toxic shock and severe sepsis.",

Due to our own experience with the basidiomycetous yeasts we will give more in depth information on these fungi. The number of recognized species is rapidly increasing due to the application of molecular systematics and the availability of a large database of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences, most notable the D1/D2 domains of the LSU rDNA and the ITS 1 and 2 regions. Only a few species are generally recognized as important pathogens for humans and animals, including Cryptococcus neoformans and Cr. gattii, several Trichosporon species and Malassezia spp. However, several non-conventional basidiomycetous yeast species can cause infection or are otherwise involved in health problems, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis. We will present data on the involvement of these emerging basidiomycetous species, such as C. adeliensis, C. diffluens, C. flavescens and C. laurentii in human diseases.

This holds true for enterotoxins, among which the genes for seg, sei, sem, sen, seo, and seu (= enterotoxin gene cluster egc) were the most prevalent ones (on average 30% of MRSA and 95% of MSSA tested positive for respective genes).

A further 13 travellers (4%) were positive for dengue IgG prior to travel indicating past exposure. Travellers with acute dengue infection had travelled to China (n = 2) India (n = 1) and Thailand (n = 1), and two of these travellers had received the JE vaccine.

Data from molecular characterisation of intestinal protists is the raw material for our current and future efforts to develop improved diagnostic PCRs. Apart from our ability to sample correctly and extract DNA from parasites directly from faeces, important issues include primer specificity and sensitivity, which have impact on predictive values of the diagnostic assays. Thus, it is important to be aware of the genetic diversity among these parasites. Extensive data from the molecular characterisation of intestinal protists are necessary if PCR-based diagnosis is to detect all genetic variants of intestinal parasites especially if the eventual aim is for it to substitute for morphology-based methods. Diagnostic PCRs are very often based on amplification of the Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, partly due to the fact that this gene is present in a high-copy number. However, data from very few strains are currently available for the SSU rRNA gene of most intestinal parasites. Often only one or two sequences are available in the Genbank database.",

Mecillinam, which is stable against ESBLs, is also a potential option. For patients with other types of infections including complicated urinary tract infections, the options are more limited. Some isolates may show low MIC to specific cephalosporins depending on the type of ESBL produced; PK/PD data suggest that these infections can be treated with these cephalosporins (particularly cefepime) using appropriate doses, but this practice is not recommended for empirical therapy because the MIC cannot be predicted. Adding an aminoglycoside to a standard regimen is a reasonable option for selected patients at low risk of renal toxicity in areas where prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance among ESBL-producers is low. The efficacy of combinations of cephalosporins with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (as cefoperazone-sulbactam, or as the combination of a cephalosporin and amoxicillin/clavulatane) and temocillin are to be studied in different clinical settings.

Unfortunately, in most infections including sepsis, a true \u201cgold standard\u201d for diagnosis does not exist. Thus, the true \u2018\u00e0dded value\u201d of a biomarker in clinical use can only be assessed in interventions studies, where the endpoints are safety and antibiotic use. In the hospital setting, this has only been shown for procalcitonin (PCT) in multiple randomized controlled interenvetion studies from several independent groups. With a similar outcome antibiotic exposure could be reduced from by 50 to 75%. For prognostic assessment, other biomarkers (e.g. adrenomedullin) have demonstrated high predictive potential to estimate the risk for mortality in the short and long term, and other adverse outcomes. A critical appraisal of the advantages and limitations of biomarkers in different clinical situations is mandatory. We discuss the current data on the use of PCT and other biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment guidance, and prognostic assessment of bacterial infections, and their potential role in the overall assessment of patients with sepsis and respiratory tract infection as its most important precursor.",

DNA-hybridisation probes and PCR-based detection are used for rapid identification of bacteria after the first signal of growth in conventional blood cultures. PCR-assays can also be used for direct detection of pathogens in blood. Such PCRs can be aimed at specific pathogens, or be more broad-range, in which case the PCR is followed by sequencing of the PCR product for identification. PCR can also be used for quantification of the amount of bacterial DNA in blood; several studies point to the value of the bacterial DNA load (BDL) in blood as a marker of severity of infection. This has been shown for pneumococci and meningococci in particular, and there is anecdotal evidence that BDL also correlates with severity of infection in staphylococcal infections. Interpretation of the results of PCR applied directly on blood samples needs further study, however, because several aspects of the kinetics of the presence of bacterial DNA in blood during infection are still unknown. In particular, we must be aware that it is difficult to define the best gold standard for bacteraemia, that PCR detects DNA, rather than living pathogens, that there is always a risk of contamination, and that little is known yet about background bacterial DNA in blood.",

It has been suggested that nucleic-acid-based technology such as PCR is more sensitive and can also shorten the time to result when compared with conventional blood culture techniques. To date, however, little is known about the kinetics and the clinical and therapeutic relevance of bacterial DNA present in the blood of patients with sepsis over time in the course of an invasive blood stream infection. The recent introduction of more standardized new PCR-based diagnostic assays including tests that provide a more exact quantitative measurement of DNA, therefore, may open a window of opportunity for a better understanding of the kinetics and clinical significance of microbial DNA circulating in the blood of patients during a blood stream infection. In fact, the potential influence of bacterial DNA on the severity and outcome of blood stream infections is underlined by the findings of recent clinical and laboratory studies suggesting that procalcitonin plasma levels and SOFA scores were significantly higher, length of ICU and hospital stay were longer, and survival was clearly decreased in subgroups of septic patients revealing positive findings in both PCR testing and blood culture. Whether a better insight into the clinical significance of DNAemia will indeed contribute to more rapid initiation of better-tailored therapy and improved management of septic patients in conjunction with other laboratory markers, however, awaits further evaluation of in laboratory studies and interventional clinical trials.

In other instances, infectious agents can up-regulate Th1 cytokines, thereby increasing selected expression of molecules such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins, as well as activation of costimulatory molecules. Several microbial agents have been found to encode superantigens that can selectively activate subsets of T cells.

This reflects the success of both innate and adaptive host responses to pneumococci. The presence of a variety of virulence factors including polysaccharide capsule and pneumolysin challenges the host response. Epithelial cells sense microbial products and release cytokines in response to pneumococci in the lower respiratory tract. Soluble factors, including complement factors, activated through both the classical and alternative pathway, play an important contribution to host defence in the lung. Alveolar macrophages play a critical role as the resident phagocytes in the lung clearing bacteria from the lung and orchestrating the inflammatory response. Once resident defence becomes compromised an inflammatory response including the recruitment of neutrophils becomes essential to microbial control but comes at the potential cost of compromising lung homeostasis. The regulation of this process also requires macrophage competence to ensure a limited inflammatory response which results in bacterial clearance but without lung injury. During the evolution of pulmonary infection a number of critical transition points occur when specific molecules and host responses are critical in determining how the infection evolves and what the outcome of infection will be. The infectious inoculum, the virulence of the pathogen and host susceptibility determines the position of these transitions and the relative role of key host defence strategies. There is increasing recognition of the role of T-cells, B-cells and dendritic cells in the pulmonary response to pneumococci. The integration of these various host responses to pneumococci, in most cases, represents a paradigm which provides a template for successful host responses to pathogenic pulmonary bacteria.",

Due to its intimate relationship with the human host, S. pneumoniae has evolved a series of strategies to vary its genetic repertoire to evade the host immune response. Using their ability to recombine DNA acquired from the environment, S. pneumoniae strains are able to renew their dispensable genome (i.e. those regions of the genome that are not shared by all isolates). Dispensable genes are frequently acquired and lost, causing a loss of correlation between the phylogenetic history of strains and the presence of genes encoding proteins with antigenic properties. As a consequence these organisms have access to a genetic repertoire \u2013 the pan-genome \u2013 that is larger than the genome of any component strain. At the species level the pan-genome of S. pneumoniae grows as the number of sequenced strains increases due to the influx of genetic material from closely related species, and the mode of this growth positions the pneumococcal species on the edge between open and closed pan-genome. A second strategy for antigenic variation is shown by the evolution of pili, long filamentous appendages involved in adhesion to host cells. Pili are encoded in the rlrA islet, a 12 kb genomic region, that consists of the rlrA transcriptional regulator, rrgA, rrgB and rrgC, coding for LPXTG proteins forming the structure of the pilus, and srtB, srtC and srtD, coding for sortase enzymes catalyzing the pilus polymerization reaction. Due to their exposure to the host immune response, rrgA and rrgB are under positive selection that causes an increased rate of fixation of new alleles, and exist in three distinct clades that correlate with the MLST designation of the strains. Instead the rrgC, srtB, srtC and srtD genes, coding for proteins not directly exposed to the host immune system, are not under positive selection. In the region containing these genes, there is evidence of homologous recombination, and 4 major recombination hotspots can be identified. Due to the homogenizing effect of recombination these genes, differently from the major structural components of the pilus, are well conserved at the sequence level. In addition, piliated strains of Pneumococcus have been associated with multi-drug resistance cassets that may provide S. pneumoniae added fitness.",

In the immunocompetent adult host CMV and HSV infections usually have a benign course. As is the case with other herpesviruses, the initial infection is followed by a lifelong latent infection from which reactivation can occur. In immunocompetent individuals, asymptomatic viral shedding may be detectable in respiratory materials such as saliva or sputum in case of both HSV and CMV and also in urine in case of CMV. This viral shedding in patients without active viral disease makes it difficult to diagnose active disease in patients, especially since the symptoms of CMV and HSV infection (excluding typical skin lesions) are often non-specific. In immunocompromised patients CMV can lead to severe disease varying from retinitis and pneumonitis to generalized CMV disease. Occasionally, HSV may cause pneumonia as a result of immunosuppression, with a high mortality. However, critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are considered immunocompetent. Studies performed in ICU patients have shown these patients to be at risk for severe infections with CMV and HSV. In case of CMV, results from previously conducted studies point towards reactivation from latency as the most likely explanation rather than primary infection in ICU patients. Recent studies suggest that active CMV infection is quite common in ICU patients, with a prevalence up to 35%, depending on the sub-group of patients studied. Furthermore, an association between the presence of a CMV infection and increased mortality in critically ill patients was found. In recent years, the interest in HSV as a causative micro-organism in ICU patients has increased, especially as a cause of pulmonary infection. Recent reports detected HSV-1 in respiratory samples from ICU patients not considered to be primarily immunocompromised. In all studies a significant adverse effect of HSV-1 shedding in the respiratory tract on clinical outcome was established. Two studies showed an association between a high load of HSV present in the respiratory tract and increased mortality. At this moment it is not clear whether the association of both CMV and HSV with increased mortality is due to the micro-organism itself or that it is just an indication of the deteriorating physical condition of the patients leading to reactivation of the virus.",

Participants reported a range of criteria for determining genotype and subtype. The guidance according to Tenover et al was the most prominent method. Future EQA distributions will gather information on the cutoff values used by participants.

            "text": "Bacterial resistance to quinolones is related to decreased permeability, active efflux, drug modification, target modification or target protection. Recent studies indicate that certain genes (recA, recC, tolC, fis, ruvC, xseA, xseB) also contribute to the intrinsic resistance of E. coli to quinolones. Microbiological and clinical aspects of low level quinolone resistance have been more often studied in enterobacteria. In these organisms, a single gyrA mutation causes resistance to nalidixic acid and MICs of fluoroquinolones as low as 0.125\u20130.25 mcg/ml (still higher than MICs of <0.008\u20130.06 mcg/ml for wild-type isolates). This mechanism favours the appearance of additional mutations in gyrA or in other topoisomerase-encoding genes, finally resulting in high level resistance. Target protection by Qnr proteins (often encoded by plasmid genes), decreased permeability by porin modifications or active efflux of chromosomal (particularly RND transporters) of plasmid (QepA proteins, OqxAB) origin also determine low level quinolone resistance. The Aac(6')-Ib-cr enzyme modifies quinolones with a piperazinyl substituent. Both in vitro and in vivo data suggest that these additional low-level mechanisms may also represent an initial step for acquisition of increased resistance. Low level resistance mechanisms may be difficult to detect because they translate into MICs below current EUCAST or CLSI breakpoints. Interestingly, plasmid-mediated mechanisms may not sufficiently compromise the activity of nalidixic acid, which results in decreased susceptibility or low-level fluoroquinolone resistance in the absence of nalidixic acid resistance, which is in contrast with the usual consequences of mutations in topoisomerase genes. As quinolone efficacy is related to Cmax/CMI and AUC /CMI parameters, small variations (of even only 2\u20134 dilutions) due to low-level resistance mechanisms may contribute to therapeutic failure. Animal models and clinical data suggest a poor outcome of patients with severe infections caused by Salmonella, Klebsiella (and presumably other enterobacteria) with low level fluoroquinolone resistance. Because of these reasons, it would be important to know actual MICs of quinolones for clinical isolates, and to obtain additional information on quinolone resistance mechanisms. This will allow a better knowledge of risk factors for acquiring low level resistant strains, and a better definition of the actual therapeutic relevance of these organisms.",

However, vancomycin treatment failure is not uncommon even when MRSA strains are fully susceptible (MIC \u22642\u00b5g/ml), and studies have described a reduction in vancomycin efficacy against MRSA strains with high MIC but within the susceptible range.

Tissue samples revealed Pseudomonas aerogenosa and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Tests for Mycobacterium avium were positive.

It is known that C5a peptidase and CspA allow GBS to evade phagocytosis by disrupting the C5a and several CXC chemokines of the host. The aim of the current study was to construct and investigate C5a-ase and CspA based recombinant polypeptides with predominantly \u03b1 helix structure and evaluate their immunogenicity. Methods: Collection of GBS strains consisting of 75 GBS clinical isolates from Russia, Sweden, China, USA and 10 reference strains was analyzed. PCR generated DNA fragments from cspA and scpB genes were cloned employing pQE expression vectors (Qiagen, USA). Immunological assays: 1. Subcutaneous immunization of mice and rabbits. 2. Opsonophagocytosis of GBS preliminary incubated with normal or immune sera with mouse peritoneal macrophages. 3. Protection studies on immune mice intraperitoneally infected with GBS. Results: All DNA samples from 85 GBS strains tested by PCR and hybridization were found to carry cspA gene. Two portions of scpB and two portions of cspA (pB1, pB3 and csp2, csp3) encoding for \u03b1 helical regions of C5a-ase and CspA were amplified and cloned. Resultant proteins PB1, PB3 and CSP2, CSP3 (M.M. 12 kDa, 10 kDa and 42 kDa, 12 kDa, respectively) were successfully expressed in E. coli followed by purification with Ni sepharose. All polypeptides under study generated humoral immune response in mice and rabbits. The antisera were examined for their opsonizing ability against GBS strains of six different serotypes employing mouse peritoneal macrophages. The data demonstrated significant opsonizing effect of anti-PB1, anti-PB3, anti-CSP3 immune sera over the control. Mice preliminary immunized with the polypeptides were studied for development of GBS infection. As result obvious GBS clearance from the spleens of mice immunized with PB1, PB3 and CSP3 in comparison with control group was determined. In contrast anti-CSP2 antibodies were found to possess neither opsonizing ability nor protective activity in above mentioned experiments.",

We had previously demonstrated that carrying PI-1 was a clonal property of S. pneumoniae and that only 27% of the invasive strains carried the rlrA islet. Furthermore, 83% of these piliated strains expressed vaccine serotypes. Similar findings were reported for the PI-2 islet which was shown to be present in 16% of a convenience sample of strains. PI-2 positive clonal complexes were associated with serotypes 1, 2, 7F, 19A, and 19F. The introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) resulted in changes in serotype frequency that can also affect pili prevalence. To evaluate this effect we determined the presence of PI-1 and PI-2 among a collection of 475 invasive isolates recovered from children after PCV7 introduction (2003\u20132008). The results were analyzed in terms of pilus islet association with antibiotic resistance, serotype, pulsed-field gel electrophoretic profile (PFGE) and multilocus sequence type.",

In such cases, antibiotics could decrease the duration of the disease, enable a faster recovery and shorten the carrier state. Azithromycin proved effective in the treatment of acute infectious gastroenterocolitis. Two studies involving US military personnel in Thailand indicated that a single azithromycin dose (1 g) or a 3-day regimen (500 mg/day) were comparable or superior to ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin in empirical treatment of acute diarrhea.

A total of 2,449 S. pneumoniae from 23 cities of Central, North-Western, Southern, Privolgsk, Ural, Siberian and Far-Eastern regions of Russia were studied from 1999 to 2009. \u03b2-lactams retained comparatively high in vitro activity against S. pneumoniae: non-susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate and ceftriaxone/cefotaxime was 9.7%, 0%, 1.8% in 1999\u20132003; 8.1%, 0.3%, 2% in 2004\u20132005 and 14.5%, 0.6%, 4.4% in 2007\u20132009, respectively.

It is a fastidious Gram-negative coccobacillus that resides exclusively in the human host. To date, NTHi infection has been accepted largely as opportunistic and to occur particularly in cases in which the host's immune status or physiological barriers have been compromised, for example in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults and otitis media (OM) in young children. However, there is increasing evidence that, despite the absence of a polysaccharide capsule, NTHi causes significant invasive disease as well as mucosal respiratory infections in subjects without predisposing risk factors. In both developed and developing countries, NTHi may cause septicaemia and meningitis in children at a prevalence at least equal to that due to a single, major Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype. In developed countries, especially in the post H. influenzae vaccine era, it is difficult to estimate the current disease burden, although some countries have suggested an increasing number of cases of invasive disease reported in the literature. Maternal genitourinary tract infection has been identified as a source of highly fatal, early onset neonatal NTHi septicaemia. The most significant mucosal infections known to be caused by NTHi are OM, sinusitis and conjunctivitis. Approximately one-third of the bacterial isolates from OM and sinusitis are NTHi. In the post-PCV-7 era, a proportionate increase in the frequency of recovery of NTHi from mucosal isolates has been demonstrated in children and adults in the United States. Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggests NTHi may also play an important role in paediatric community acquired lower respiratory infections, especially in children with recurrent and persistent bronchitis & pneumonia.

A total of 10,081 H. influenzae infections were reported between 2000 and 2006;2 of these, 2836 (28%) were due to Hib and 4466 (44%) to non-typeable H. Influenza (NTHi). It was found that the incidence of NTHi was almost twice that of Hib (0.28 versus 0.15 per 100,000 cases) and that both Hib and NTHi infections were more common in infants and the elderly. Moreover, the incidence of NTHi was much higher than Hib in the first month of life (11.4 versus 1.2 per 100,000 cases) and infections were more likely to occur in the first week of life, suggesting vertically acquired infection. Overall, however, the median age at disease was higher for NTHi infections than for Hib (58 years versus 5 years, p<0.0001). NTHi infections were also associated with: a higher case fatality ratio (CFR; 366/3172 [11.5%] versus 88/2005 [4.4%]; p<0.0001), particularly among infants (17.4% versus 2.9%; p<0.0001); and a higher proportion of NTHi infections among women of child-bearing age. In addition, one-third of reported meningitis cases were due to NTHi. The CFRs for Hib and NTHi meningitis were similar in EU-IBIS data (4.1% versus 4.2%) but in England and Wales, the CFR was much higher for NTHi meningitis (17% versus 5%). The reasons for this are unclear.

Candida and Aspergillus species are the predominant pathogens. Candida bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality in both neutropenic and non-neutropenic critically ill patients. Risk factors associated are diverse and include exposure to broad spectrum antimicrobial agents, mucosal colonization, indwelling vascular catheters, surgery and cancer chemotherapy. Differences in geographical epidemiology are emerging, in particular regarding a shift towards non-albicans species. This shift has been correlated with routine fluconazole administration. Aspergillus spp. can cause a wide spectrum of diseases in humans, including allergy, superficial infection, and invasive disease. Invasive aspergillosis has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The most important species are Aspergillus fumigatus followed by Aspergillus flavus.",

The emergence of these organisms is multifactorial and can be related to more intense immunosuppression, the prolonged survival of patients, and the selective pressure of broad spectrum antifungal agents used for prophylaxis or therapy. Among these rare mould infections, the zygomycetes are the most commonly encountered, and appear to be associated with the use of voriconazole. Aspergillus terreus, a species that is resistant to amphotericin B, and less frequently, A. ustus and A. lentulus, have been noted increasingly as causes of invasive aspergillosis in some tertiary care centres. Scedosporium with innate resistance to many antifungal agents have emerged as major causes of disseminated infections, followed by infections due to Fusarium species. Dematiaceous, or brown-black, fungi, most often associated with chronic localised infections, are now increasingly reported as a cause of disseminated infection in immunosuppressed hosts.",

However, our microbiome is largely unexplored and there is a great need to increase our understanding of the interactions between our human and microbial genomes. The sequencing of the human genome constituted a starting point in the understanding of human biology at a global scale, yet today there is a growing agreement that human health and disease cannot be understood without considering the microbial communities. Now when the human microbiome project has been launched a number of international consortiums are starting up with efforts to explore the role of the human microbiota in health and disease. Many lines of evidence suggest a role for both commensal and transient microbes in the status of human health as well as for the risk of contracting certain diseases. During the last years molecular microbiology has revolutionized the landscape of microbiology and will continue to do so by providing new solutions for microbe identification and characterization. Nextgeneration sequencing has opened up new areas of research for people in the field of intestinal, skin, oral cavity and other microbiomics. The high-throughput sequencing platforms we now have access to will hopefully also help to increase our understanding of host-bacteria interactions, immune maturation and mechanisms behind chronic disease development. An interdisciplinary approach must be taken on comprising medical, epidemiological, computational, and biotechnology expertise focusing on understanding the human microbial communities and their effect on human health. Application of different \u201c\u00f2mics\u201d-methods and computational systems biology methods to unique biobanks will be required in order to map out the human microbiome as well as the human cellular machinery interacting it.",

They are often isolated from urines of patients attending general practice, but there are few data to assess accurately the extent of the community burden. The prevalence of ESBL producers in faeces from healthy people is typically <5% in Europe. In a recent multicentre study of non-hospitalized patients with infections, one third of the ESBL producers (mainly E. coli) were from those with no recent health care contact (Ben-Ami et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2009;49:682). In the UK, ESBL-producing E. coli cause c. 2500 cases of bacteraemia p.a., and may be estimated to cause c. 50,000 urinary tract infections p.a. Many belong to the globally-disseminated O25:H4-ST131 uropathogenic clone and have CTX-M-15 ESBL, though CTX-M-3 is equally common in this clone in Belfast, a city where the ST131 clone is present in the faeces of 40% of nursing home residents. CTX-M-15 ESBL is associated with IncFII multi-resistance plasmids, while CTX-M-3 in Belfast is encoded on IncI1 plasmids. These plasmids cannot readily be lost even in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure, since they encode multiple \u00e0ddiction\u2019 systems. Hence ESBL producers may serve as long-term community reservoirs of resistance genes. Foreign travel may also be associated with gut colonization by ESBL-producing isolates, and the ESBL present often reflects the type most prevalent in the countries visited. Food remains an under-explored potential source for ESBL-producing E. coli. Raw chicken has been sampled in the UK, with CTX-M group 2 and 8 ESBLs found in meat imported from South America; these types account for <1% of ESBLs from clinical infections. There are currently no data to suggest wide presence of CTX-M-15 ESBL in foodstuffs; it may be found in E. coli from animals, but the strains are usually distinct from the dominant human clinical types. ESBL producers are often multiresistant. Carbapenems are the drugs of choice for serious infections, but resistance may emerge in strains with reduced permeability, as observed in a UK nursing home resident who had no recent hospitalization or carbapenem exposure. Carbapenemase-producing E. coli are rare, although isolates with NDM-1 metallo-carbapenemase in addition to CTX-M-15 and acquired AmpC enzymes give cause for concern lest they become as prevalent as those with \u2018traditional\u2019 CTX-M-15 enzyme, or follow them into the community setting.",

Molecular epidemiology studies suggested that the sudden worldwide increase of CTX-M-15-producing E. coli is mostly due to a single clone named ST131 and that foreign travel to high-risk areas such as the Indian subcontinent might play in part a role in spread of this clone across different continents. The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae Empiric antibiotic coverage for these resistant organisms should be considered in community patients presenting with sepsis involving the urinary tract especially in patients with certain risk factors such recent antibiotic use, residence in a long-term care facility, recent hospitalization, males older than 65 years and recent travel to a high-risk area. Failure to initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy from the start appears to be responsible for higher patient mortality. Studies from different parts of the world shows that that up to 5 percent of the population in the community can be rectally colonized by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae but the large scale introduction of these bacteria into the hospital setting has not yet been demonstrated. However higher rates of colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are present in household contacts of patients with infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, residents from nursing homes or long-term care centers. Preventing the spread of these bacteria and managing infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli from the community remain difficult and controversial issues.",

This cooperation can exist in centralizing a part of or almost all activity in a central hospital-based lab or can be a network with a division of labor between collaborating labs. All these solutions share one factor. By increasing size, they seek to increase cost-efficiency and facilitate the introduction of new, specialized and expensive techniques. Outsourcing is often rejected because it risks reducing microbiology to a purely analytical activity with little microbiologist-dependent added-value. Concentrating smaller microbiology labs in one central lab or networking may not always be possible for practical reasons and will again increase the distance between clinical microbiologists and some of the microbiological tests. A solution that can assure a sufficient lab size even in mediumsized hospitals without the need for collaboration with other labs or outsourcing is integration of the microbiology lab with other pathology labs such as clinical chemistry or clinical hematology. This kind of integration can combine economy of scale with conserving the microbiological activity within the hospital and thus the close link between microbiology and infectious disease and infection control specialists. Integration of laboratories in its simplest form can exist in sharing of machines and lab space. It can also lead to an integration of all diagnostic activity according to common workflows. An example is an integrated unit for molecular testing performing all nucleic acid based testing; microbiological, hematological but also human genetics or forensic medicine. This integrated lab demands new ways of organizing lab activity. Essential to the integrated lab is a separation of medical and technical expertise and medical and organizational responsibility.",

We have been developing two approaches to repopulate the immune system following transplantation to reduce both types of risk. Our first approach is to isolate viral and fungal antigen reactive T lymphocytes from donor blood and expand them ex vivo before infusing them into the stem cell recipients. We have generated T lymphocytes that are specific for common viruses such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus, and engineer them to expand efficiently in vivo. They have proved effective at preventing and treating serious virus illness in the target patient populations and we are now extending this approach to the treatment of fungal disease. Our second approach is to remove alloreactive T cells from donor PBM and infuse these depleted T cells to produce broad immune reconstitution. As a further safety measure to prevent GvHD from the infused cells, we incorporate a new suicide gene composed of a modified caspase 9 that can be activated by a small molecule drug. Early clinical results show high safety and efficacy of the approach.",

The highest MRSA positivity rates were seen in emergency cases in hepatology (4.3%), interventional radiology (3.7%) and vascular surgery (3.3%). 1.5% of elective vascular surgery patients were MRSA positive. The lowest MRSA positivity rate was in day case orthopaedics where 1,006 patients were screened without detecting a single positive patient. NNT to detect a positive ranged from 24 to >1,006 depending on clinical speciality and admission type.",

For screening, and decolonisation of identified MRSA positives, PCR had the greatest ability to reduce MRSA transmission (giving a 94% reduction in infections per 100 admissions, compared to 64% with conventional culture). Including parameter uncertainty, the best decision depended on the decision maker's willingness to pay for health benefits: at a value of L20,000\u201330,000 per QALY, admission screening with PCR combined with decolonisation of identified positives was the best strategy.

In the management of bacterial infections, identification of the pathogen following growth remains essential to propose as soon as possible the most appropriate treatment before the availability of antibiotic susceptibility. The strategy for most common pathogens requires Gram staining, the results of simple tests such as determination of oxidase and catalase activity and appropriate phenotypic tests using commercial identification kits and/or automated systems. A new proteomic strategy is progressively changing this strategy by identifying bacterial or fungal species grown on plates within minutes. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-offlight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) of intact bacteria yield reproducible spectrum depending upon strain or species. Using whole viable bacteria we describe here the application of MALDI-TOF-MS to the identification of bacterial pathogens isolated in routine clinical microbiology laboratories. Our aim was, once a primary isolate of a bacterium has grown onto a plate, to identify spectral prints, in the MALDI-TOF spectrum, that can be used to recognize the genus or the species. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed using bacteria obtained from one isolated colony. Over 400 clinically relevant bacterial species were selected. For each of these species one or several references strain was (were) selected to establish spectral prints. For each strain, only peaks that were conserved in the spectra of all 10 isolated colonies and with a relative intensity above 0.1 were retained, thus leading to a set of 3 to 30 selected peaks per strain. For each group of pathogens the database was validated using a set of isolates identified using mostly 16S RNA sequencing. The use of this strategy to identify bacterial species in clinical microbiology laboratories will be presented.",

Health resources will shift with population growth; thus, measures to reduce health cost through preventive care are prudent. Illnesses from food-borne pathogens are avoidable if technologies are used to maximize safety of food and water, populations are educated in self-care, and medical therapies are advanced for early diagnosis and treatment. Since self-care strategies require alteration of usual cultural and habitual behavior, education efforts have limited success with the elderly. Why is it difficult to teach the elderly how to handle food safely and what are the consequences for failure to heed professional advice? Medically, when is a person elderly? When does the body begin senescence and susceptibility to opportunistic infections increase? The aging immune system is the primary reason for susceptibility to food-borne pathogens in the elderly. Natural, senescent immunity is exacerbated by the immune insufficiency of chronic disease and pharmacological therapies common in the population. Immune insufficiency associated with malnutrition becomes a causative factor as the physical and mental capacity of the aging individual deteriorates. Poor hygiene, failure to handle and store foods safely, and inability to distinguish between safe and tainted food may all be consequences of diminished mental or general health. For those in group housing, failure of care staff to heed food handling guidance could affect the health of multiple residents due to wide-spread exposure and immune insufficiency. Yet, acceptance of well-meaning advice to change poor health habits is limited due to lack of trust in the efficacy of the information, information that is contrary to cultural and traditional practices, or the failure to recognize and accept the decline of physiological and mental health. The challenge to the health professional that is providing food safety guidance is to recognize the social, health and mental barriers that control the ability of the individual to act on the advice. The goal is no food-borne illness in the world, but reality is that when preventative care is no longer possible, palliative care must take its place.",

Rapid, accurate discrimination between Listeria strains is essential for appropriate therapeutic management and timely intervention for infection control. A rapid method involving matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) that shows promise for identification of Listeria species and typing and even allows for differentiation at the level of clonal lineages among pathogenic strains of L. monocytogenes is presented. A total of 146 strains of different Listeria species and serotypes as well as clinical isolates were analyzed. The method was compared with the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of 48 Listeria strains comprising L. monocytogenes strains isolated from food-borne epidemics and sporadic cases, isolates representing different serotypes, and a number of Listeria strains whose genomes have been completely sequenced. Following a short inactivation/extraction procedure, cell material from a bacterial colony was deposited on a sample target, dried, overlaid with a matrix necessary for the MALDI process, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. This technique examines the chemistry of major proteins, yielding profile spectra consisting of a series of peaks, a characteristic \u201cfingerprint\u201d mainly derived from ribosomal proteins. Specimens can be prepared in a few minutes from plate or liquid cultures, and a spectrum can be obtained within 1 minute.

The arrival of MALDI-MS and ESI-MS has made the study of the proteome so accessible that within less than a decade platforms are now available for clinical applications. Thus, the development of intact cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is approaching maturity and its uptake by diagnostic laboratories has been increasing steadily. Extensive databases eg AnagnosTec (>100,000 MS spectra), negligible sample preparation and rapid analysis have been the main reasons for its success. The peptides/proteins present in the MS spectra are either surface-associated on intracellular ribosomal proteins, consequently, at present, little information can be obtained using solely this approach to gain information on antibiotic resistance patterns. More in-depth analysis involving 1D, 2D and LC-MS-MS methods are required.

In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting turned out as a very promissing tool for reliable and rapid (hands-on time <5 min) identification of clincal yeasts with low costs for consumables per identification (<1 \u20ac). This approch was not so much hampered by influence of the morphology of the fungus and cultural conditions e. g. culture media and minor changes in incubation temperature when compared to MS-based identification of hyphomycetes. So this technique facilitates high through put and objective identification of yeasts when using a quality-checked database.",

Long-term care facilities (LTCF) are institutions which provide heath care to people unable to manage themselves in the community. Most residents are elder and have multiple comorbidities. Residents will stay at LTCF for months or years. Hence, comfort, dignity and socialization are important issues. In order to control costs, many post-acute patients who used to stay in acute care hospitals for a long time, are now currently transferred to LTCF. This situation has led to the necessity of invasive devices such as urinary and vascular catheters and feeding tubes. This fact increases the incidence of nosocomial infections, as does the one observed in hospitals. Several significant differences can be pointed out between hospitals and LTCF; most notably the nurse-patient ratio, the availability of microbiological cultures, laboratory and diagnostic equipment on site and the access to costly antibiotics. In addition there are few LTCF with infection control staff. Most of them lack of nosocomial infections surveillance programs and also of antibiotic policy strategies. In general, rates of colonization by multiresistant bacteria in residents of LTCF are higher than those observed in hospitalized patients. For example, some studies have shown that rates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage among LTCF residents can reach 50%, while in hospitals are generally below 1\u20132%. Although it is possible to detect outbreaks, MRSA infections in LTCF are sporadic, related to pressure ulcers and generally less serious than those seen in hospitals. The prevalence of multidrug resistant Gram-negative (MDR-GNB) bacteria is also high among LTCF residents, particularly among those with faecal incontinence and antibiotic exposure. MDR-GNB is frequently recovered from environmental samples and common areas providingopportunities for person-to-person transmission. Clostridium difficile continues to be an increasing problem in LTCF. It is the most common cause of non-epidemic acute diarrheal illness in LTCF. Outbreaks have also been recognized, particularly related to antimicrobial consumption. In conclusion, LTCF act as a reservoir of multi-resistant bacteria that can cause sporadic infections as well as indolent outbreaks. A multilevel approach, including antimicrobial policies and prevention transmission measures are needed to limit the impact of this problem.",

            "text": "Herpes Zoster (shingles) is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus. It is characterized acutely by a painful rash, and 10\u201320% of patients experience prolonged pain (postherpetic neuralgia), which in rare cases can last for years and be debilitating. Both the incidence and severity of zoster increase with age. Treatment options for zoster and post herpetic neuralgia are limited and costly. A shingles vaccine was licensed in Europe and the United States in 2006 following the completion of the Shingles Prevention Study, a randomized controlled trial of 38,546 healthy adults; vaccination decreased both the incidence and severity of zoster over a median of 3 years. Primary efficacy was measured by a burden of illness score which combined incidence, duration and severity of pain. The vaccine decreased burden of illness by 61%, but the effects varied by age. Efficacy in preventing acute zoster declined with age at vaccination, and there was minimal efficacy past age 80 years. Vaccination reduced the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia at all ages by 66%. This was achieved by preventing acute zoster among patients aged 60\u201369 years, and attenuating disease in patients aged \u2a7e70 years. Side effects were mild, but serious adverse events were more common in the vaccination group (1.9 percent vs. 1.3 percent, P = 0.03). Debate about the use of the vaccine revolves not around the effectiveness, but the cost-effectiveness, as the vaccine is expensive (\u20ac136 per dose). Published analyses have found incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from \u20ac18,500 to \u20ac76,500 per quality-adjusted life year. The vaccine appears to be most cost-effective among 65- to 70-year-olds, as the incidence of disease in this age group is high, but vaccine recipients are still able to mount a satisfactory immune response. Despite recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control that all adults aged \u2a7e60 years receive the shingles vaccine, uptake in the US has been slow. Barriers to vaccination include difficulties with vaccine storage, variable insurance coverage, and competing priorities for primary care doctors. Since licensure, the cost of the vaccine has increased by 30%. Moreover, studies of willingnessto-pay suggest that current vaccine pricing is not acceptable to patients. In conclusion, the shingles vaccine appears to be effective in reducing morbidity, but the cost is high and universal vaccination over age 60 years may not currently represent good value.",

Analysis of the discrepant results indicated that 3 FQ-resistant strains (including one XDR) with mutations in gyrB were missed by MTBDRsl, and that one FQ-susceptible strain, identified as resistant by MTBDRsl, had a double mutation T80A-A90G in GyrA not conferring resistance to FQ. Five strains (including 2 XDR) without mutation in rrs were mono-resistant to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide and were missed by MTBDRsl. Finally, 16/28 ethambutol-resistant strains had a mutation at codon 306 in embB while 2/24 ethambutol susceptible strains had such a mutation. Conclusions: MTBDRsl efficiently detects the most common mutations involved in resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides-cyclic peptide and ethambutol and accurately assesses susceptibility to amikacin. However, due to mutations not included in the test (particularly in gyrB) or yet-uncharacterized resistance mechanisms (particularly those related to ethambutol and to aminoglycosides-cyclic peptide monoresistance), the wild-type results yielded by the MTBDRsl test need to be confirmed by drug susceptibility testing when the prevalence of resistance is high.",

VZV vaccine induces both humoral and cellular immunity. However, there is no clear correlation between IgG antibody titers and protection against infection. Antibody protection is a function of both concentration and affinity (=chemical binding strength). Avidity is a measure of functional affinity. It has been suggested that studies of vaccine efficacy should incorporate analysis of avidity, since high avidity is a marker of memory priming. The present study was designed in order to answer the question as to whether solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients have a lower VZV IgG antibody avidity, despite having protective IgG antibody levels after vaccination, or not.",

Antimicrobial type, doses and duration of therapy will be discussed.

Treatment protocols of phase II studies with daptomycin with or without rifampin in PJI and OST will be reviewed as well as the use of higher doses of daptomycin. Common pitfalls and reasons for treatment failure will be outlined. Empiric antibiotic therapy should not be administered before microbiological diagnostic confirmation, which is difficult when antibiotics are administered for a draining wound overlying an implant. In addition, the risk of development of antimicrobial resistance is high, particularly for rifampin. Therefore, rifampin should be avoided if there is contact between the body surface and the implant (e.g. open wounds, wound dehiscence, fistulae, vacuum-assisted closure foam or drainage).

Key changes include: (i) the rise and, in some countries, subsequent decline of MRSA, also (ii) the rise of quinolone and cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli and Klebsiella spp., with CTX-M ESBLs increasingly the dominant source of the cephalosporin resistance, (iii) the proliferation of A. baumannii with OXA carbapenemases and (iv) the \u2018loss\u2019 of fluoroquinolones against gonorrhoea, with resistance rates as high as 90% in China. Treatment shifts predicated on these problems are now exerting their own selection pressure, favouring the spread of yet further resistances. The greatest concern for hospital medicine is the emergence of Enterobacteriaceae with acquired carbapenemases, including the IMP, VIM, and NDM metallo-types, the class A enzyme KPC and the class D enzyme, OXA-48. At present, Enterobacteriaceae with these enzymes are proliferating in different parts of the world: NDM in India, OXA-48 in Turkey, VIM in Greece and KPC in the US \u2013 but the stability of this distribution is unpredictable, in view of migration and medical tourism. In general, the IMP, VIM and NDM enzymes are spread by plasmids, whilst accumulation of K. pneumoniae isolates with KPC enzyme largely involves dissemination of the ST258 clone. \u2018Loss\u2019 of the carbapenems against Enterobacteriaceae would be a public health catastrophe, in view of the lack of alternative therapies for infections due to multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria. A shift that should be of greater concern than it is presently receiving is the erosion of the antigonococcal activity of cephalosporins. Owing to changes to PBPs, porins and efflux it is increasingly common to see N. gonorrhoeae isolates with cefixime and ceftriaxone MICs of 0.12\u20130.5 mg/L, representing the edge of treatability, again with a lack of convenient alterative therapies. Future risks are harder to predict but potentially include transferable resistance to new anti-Gram-positive agents, and it is notable here that many soil streptomycetes can degrade daptomycin. Such organisms were the sources of several other resistance genes that have spread to mobile DNA and into clinical pathogens. But, as the saying goes, \u2018Prediction is very hard, especially when it concerns the future\u2019 and only two things are certain: that neither evolution nor resistance surprises have stopped yet.",

PCT increases rapidly upon infection (3\u20136 hours) and decreases upon recovery. PCT correlates with severity and has prognostic implications. Its kinetics makes it a good marker for assessing the effectiveness of treatment, which is a prerequisite for safe guidance of antibiotic therapy. PCT levels can be used to guide antibiotic therapy in individual patients as a surrogate biomarker. Antibiotic stewardship based on PCT cut off ranges has successfully been implemented in patients with LRTI in different clinical settings. Thereby, initiation or continuation of antibiotics was more or less discouraged (<0.1 ug/L or <0.25 ug/L) or encouraged (>0.5 ug/L or >0.25 ug/L) (Figure 1\n). If PCT values are increased and antibiotics therapy is initiated, repeated PCT measurements are recommended and antibiotics can be discontinued using the same cut-off ranges. This clinical algorithm was prospectively tested in different intervention trials in the emergency room, in the intensive care unit, in primary care and recently, this concept has been externally validated in a large Swiss nation-wide multi centre trial including over 1350 patients. Overall, PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship reduced antibiotic prescription rate by 40\u201350% in patients with acute bronchitis or AECOPD; in CAP, it reduced the initial prescription rate by about 10%, but importantly shortened the duration of antibiotic therapy by 65% with a similar outcome in patients with all severities. Similarly, PCT guidance safely reduced antibiotic exposure by more than 75% in primary care patients with upper and lower RTI9. Thereby, PCT guidance significantly reduced antibiotic-related side effects, especially diarrhoea and nausea.",

Molecular epidemiology studies suggested that the sudden worldwide increase of multi-resistant CTX-M-producing E. coli (especially CTX-M-15) is mostly due to a single clone named ST131 and that foreign travel to high-risk areas such as the Indian subcontinent might play in part a role in spread of this clone across different continents.

These enzymes efficiently hydrolyze pencillins and many cephalosporins but are not effective catalysts for extended-spectrum cephalosporins and thus do not provide resistance against these drugs. However, variants of TEM-1 and SHV-1 that can hydrolyze extended spectrum cephalosporins have evolved in clinical isolates over the last two decades, which has limited treatment options. These evolved enzymes, termed extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs), contain from one to five amino acid substitutions that result in increased catalytic efficiency of the enzymes for hydrolysis of extended spectrum cephalosporins. Sitedirected and random mutagenesis studies have revealed that the amino acid substitutions commonly found in the evolved variants increase the catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of extended spectrum cephalosporins and, in some cases, stabilize the evolved enzymes. The evolution of high level resistance involves a process of mutational changes in the active site that increase catalysis but often decrease protein stability. This, in turn, leads to the acquisition of secondary mutations that increase the in vivo half life of the enzyme. The interactions between amino acid substitutions and the resultant impact on the evolution of ESBL activities will be discussed.",

Nevertheless, AmpC mediated resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins can occur due to high levels of enzyme production or through mutations in the enzyme that result in increased hydrolysis of the drugs. Several amino acid substitutions as well as small insertions and deletions in AmpC enzymes have been reported to increase resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins and have been associated with increased hydrolysis of these antibiotics. The mutational changes occur in regions in the vicinity of the active site and may act by increasing access for the bulky oxyiminocephalosporins. In addition, random mutagenesis experiments have revealed positions where amino acid substitutions alter the substrate specificity of the enzyme. The impact of amino acid substitutions on the evolution of extended spectrum cephalosporin hydrolysis by AmpC enzymes will be discussed.",

Lymphadenitis due to NTM strikes mainly young children whereas pulmonary and skin/soft tissue infections are common in adults. The frequency of NTM lymphadenitis has increased over the past few decades. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, PPD skin test and bacterial isolation from nodal aspiration or incision. Mycobacterium scrofulaceum was the most common cause in the 1970s, replaced by M. avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and M. haemophilum in last two decades. Management options are surgery, antibiotics or \u2018\u00f2bservation only\u201d. Complete excision of the infected lymph node has been considered the optimal therapy by most researchers, however, it is associated with various side effects such as unacceptable scarring with or without keloid formation, wound breakdown, secondary staphylococcal infection and facial nerve paresis. Most facial nerve damage is transient, although in approximately 2% permanent palsy developed. Incision and drainage is performed when the lesions are too large to be excised. Few retrospective case series have demonstrated superiority of complete excision over incision and drainage. Pharmacologic therapy with clarithromycin alone, or combined with other antimycobacterial agents such as rifampicin, rifabutin, or ethanbutol have been reported. On the other hand, there are no controlled clinical trials showing the efficacy of chemotherapy versus placebo. Very few cases of \u2018\u00f2bservation only\u201d in children with NTM lymphadenitis were reported in the past.

Pneumocystis colonization is defined as detection of the organism or its DNA without signs or symptoms of pneumonia. Sensitive molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction are frequently utilized to identify colonization. Accumulating evidence suggests that colonization with Pneumocystis may be an important clinical phenomenon. The clinical significance of colonization is not yet fully understood, but it may be important for several reasons. Colonized persons may be at risk of developing Pneumocystis pneumonia. Even if colonized individuals do not themselves develop Pneumocystis pneumonia, they might transmit the organism to others. Exposure to Pneumocystis-colonized animals leads to colonization of normal animals and to the development of clinical disease in immunosuppressed animals. Colonization in persons receiving long-term anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis may also lead to the development of mutations that have been associated with drug resistance. Furthermore, Pneumocystis may play a role in progression of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The presence of Pneumocystis in the lungs, even at low levels as seen in colonization, produces inflammatory changes similar to those seen in COPD, with increases in the numbers of neutrophils and cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes. Colonization with Pneumocystis has been demonstrated in HIV-infected subjects, and HIV-infected smokers are particularly susceptible to Pneumocystis colonization regardless of CD4 cell count or use of Pneumocystis prophylaxis. Pneumocystis colonization is also increased in non-HIV-infected patients with COPD and is directly related to the severity of the disease. Models of Pneumocystis colonization in mice with smoke exposure and in non-human primates infected with an HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus chimera demonstrate the development of COPD-like changes. These studies suggest that treatment or prevention of Pneumocystis colonization in at-risk populations may be a novel therapy for COPD.",

It achieves this through the expression of nine latent proteins. However, in vivo EBV persists in a benign, dormant state in resting memory B cells. The link between these two observations is that in vivo EBV uses its latent proteins to activate newly infected cells in lymphoid tissue so that the cells can then differentiate through the germinal center to become resting memory cells. In doing so the virus infected cells mimic the normal process whereby antigen activated B cells become long term memory cells. At each stage of the process EBV uses different combinations of latent proteins. If at any stage the infected cell is unable to progress into the resting memory state it is at risk of becoming a tumor expressing the pattern of latent proteins characteristic of its particular stage of infection. Thus EBV is associated with several human malignancies including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, immunoblastic lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. Each of these tumors expresses a different pattern of latent proteins reflecting their origins from specific stages of the viral life cycle. Recently it has been shown that EBV also expresses \u223c40miRNAs in latently infected cells. miRNAs are thought to play critical regulatory functions in normal and malignant cells but the roles of the EBV miRNAs remain unclear. It is also unknown if they are expressed in a tumor specific pattern like the latent proteins. In this presentation I will:\n1.Discuss the mechanism of how EBV establishes persistent infection in memory B cells including recent evidence on how EBV usurps the germinal center process to gain access to the memory B cell compartment.2.Detail how the model of EBV persistence explains the origin of the EBV associated tumors especially the lymphomas.3.Demonstrate tumor specific expression profiles of miRNAs and a possible functional significance of these expression patterns.\n",

Among these patterns lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a component of the Gram-positive cell wall, represents a potent immunostimulatory molecule that is able to elicit cytokine release from human peripheral blood in a TLR2/6 dependent manner.

Besides Helicobacter pylori and some parasites there are mostly viruses for which a causative relation to malignant diseases has been demonstrated. Establishing such a link depends on the epidemiologic profile of the disease and the putative causal infectious agent as well as its biologic properties in experimental cell culture and in vivo models. Often one of the classical Koch's postulates (isolation of the putative agent from the affected tissue) cannot be fulfilled and, in some instances, not even traces of the microbe (i.e. its nucleic acid) can consistently be found in the tumor. The reason might be that cancer is the late and rare consequence of a chronic infection where replication of the infectious agent does no longer take place and gene functions are not required for maintenance of the tumor growth. Therefore a combination of observational and experimental strategies has to be applied to collect sufficient evidence and to initiate attempts for preventive measures that target the infectious agent such as development of vaccines. Examples of classical and innovative approaches will be presented.",

Many susceptibility testing methods recommended the use of ESBL screening and confirmation tests on a routine basis. However, a number of issues have emerged routine use over the years:\n1.The problem of defining an adequate number of substrates to ensure sufficiently sensitive screening.2.The lack of simple and reliable phenotypic methods to detect ESBLs in species with inducible AmpC \u03b2-lactamases.3.The failure of current ESBL detection methods to provide advice on the interpretation of a positive screening test but a negative confirmation test, especially if the isolates are \u201csusceptible\u201d to extended-spectrum cephalosporins using method-recommended breakpoints.4.Animal model data showing that the response to treatment of ENTB (measured as in vivo killing) is correlated with the MIC of the strain, and not the presence or absence of an ESBL.\n",

Lower breakpoints for injectable cephalosporins are now published by CLSI and EUCAST, with recommendations to optionally conduct specific ESBL tests, for instance if there is an epidemiological need.

In this imperfect reality an ESBL producer with a cefotaxime MIC of 1 mg/L (probably responsive to cefotaxime in vivo) cannot be reliably distinguished from one with an MIC of 4 mg/L (probably not responsive) and it is simpler and safer to follow the precautionary approach of seeking the ESBL and, if this is found, reporting the isolate as resistant.",

Shortly after its discovery, the ability of Legionella to multiply intracellularly in fresh water protozoa was discovered. This long lasting co-evolution between the eukaryotic host and Legionella has led to the selection of a panoply of virulence factors, which allow to exploit important cellular processes during infection. Compelling evidence for the importance of protozoa in the evolution of this bacterium comes from analysis of complete genome sequences. A key feature of the L. pneumophila genomes is the presence of a high number and wide variety of eukaryotic like proteins and protein domains probably acquired through horizontal gene transfer and/or convergent evolution. In the last years several different typing methods aiming in investigating the molecular epidemiology of L. pneumophila have been developed. Furthermore, the access to whole genome sequences of several L. pneumophila strains allowed to apply large scale comparative genomics studies using DNA arrays. A higher genetic diversity among environmental isolates with respect to clinical isolates and the presence of specific clones of L. pneumophila overrepresented in human disease or causing legionellosis world wide, were identified.

The in vitro diagnostic industry has in recent years invested significantly to develop and market advanced SA/MRSA screening tests for clinical and public health decision support in healthcare facilities. Successful technology innovation meets longstanding medical needs of timely detection of SA/MRSA carriers to accelerate control of transmission. The purpose of SA/MRSA screening is two-fold: (1) to adapt individual therapeutic and prophylactic treatment regimens and (2) to isolate and decolonise carriers early on to reduce secondary nosocomial transmission. Novel screening tests include enhanced culture-based methods and molecular-based DNA detection methods. Significant enhancement of culture based MRSA screening has been achieved with marketing of new generation of selective, cefoxitincontaining chromogenic agar media. The best performing media provide MRSA detection within 16 to 48 h post sampling with variable sensitivity (ranging 50\u201399%) and good to excellent specificity (>95%). A more sophisticated, semi-automated system of luminescent growth detection in selective liquid media proved insufficiently sensitive in clinical trials. Several PCR systems are commercially available for MRSA screening. PCR assay time varies from 75 min to 6 h. Analytical complexity ranges from multi-step manual procedure of sample preparation, DNA extraction, amplification and hybridisation to fully automated systems with minimal sample preparation. Diagnostic accuracy of PCR tests varies according to test, test version, sample site and reference method used as gold standard with sensitivity range of 70\u2013100% and specificity range of 90\u201399%. Impact of rapid MRSA screening on transmission control effectiveness depends on many contextual factors, including workflow integration and clinical turn-around time, case-mix and type of care, MRSA incidence and prevalence, infection control policy, compliance with infection control measures and intervention study design. Cost-effectiveness evaluation should carefully examine these parameters for each test before routine implementation.",

MBL producers commonly exhibit resistance not only to a broad-spectrum of \u03b2-lactams but also to a variety of non-\u03b2-lactam agents owing to association of MBL genes with those affecting different groups of antibiotics. The IMP and VIM enzymes are the most common acquired MBLs. These enzymes were first reported in Japan and Europe but are now broadly disseminated in many countries of all populated continents. Production of acquired MBLs is most often observed in P. aeruginosa, with VIM-2 being the most ubiquitous enzyme, and less frequently in Acinetobacter spp. and in Enterobacteriaceae, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, with VIM-1 or VIM-4 being the most typical variants in the latter species. MBLs of other genetic groups were either identified in isolates causing sporadic infections and local outbreaks (e.g. GIM-1, SIM-1, KHM-1, AIM-1) or as endemic types in some geographic areas (e.g. SPM-1 in Latin America). However, the recent reports of the international importation of SPM-1 from Brazil to Switzerland and of NDM-1 from India to the UK provide continuing evidence of the increasing complexity of MBL epidemiology. The prevalence of MBL-producers varies significantly among different countries and their epidemiology now ranges from sporadic monoclonal outbreaks to polyclonal endemicity. Furthermore, MBL-producing strains are no longer confined to nosocomial environment but are being identified also in residents of long-term-care facilities and even in patients with community-acquired infections. The association of MBL genes with mobile genetic platforms (e.g. Tn402-like transposons in the case of blaVIM genes), broad host range plasmids and highly epidemic clones (e.g. P. aeruginosa clonal complexes CC235 and CC111) were apparently implicated in the rapid spread of these important resistance determinants.",

As with other Gram-negative species, carbapenem resistance has been attributed to multiple mechanisms, including reduced permeability through loss of outer membrane proteins, altered penicillin-binding proteins and overexpression of weakly carbapenem-hydrolyzing \u03b2-lactamases, but the major mechanism is carbapenemase production. Diverse carbapenemases have been reported in A. baumannii, differing in their regional prevalence: isolates with IMP or VIM metallo-enzymes are globally scattered; those with SIM-1 are associated particularly with the Far East, while NDM-1 has been observed only rarely. OXA class D enzymes are the dominant carbapenemases in A. baumannii, with 5 phylogenetically distinct groups identified. OXA-51-like enzymes are intrinsic to the species, and are only associated with carbapenem resistance when up-regulated by an adjacent insertion sequence, usually ISAba1. By contrast, OXA-23-like, OXA-40-like, OXA-58-like and OXA-143 carbapenemases have all been acquired via horizontal gene spread. These enzymes usually confer clinically significant carbapenem resistance, although the MICs for individual isolates are influenced by the particular gene present, its copy number, and presence of accessory mechanisms (e.g. loss of the CarO porin). The blaOXA genes may be located on the chromosome, as part of large resistance islands, or on plasmids. Local outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii typically include a predominant strain, and strains from epidemiologically unlinked sites may show sufficient similarity to be regarded as the same clone. There are two dominant carbapenemresistant clones in the UK, \u2018OXA-23 clone 1\u2019 has OXA-23 enzyme, and the \u2018South-east clone\u2019 has ISAba1-up-regulated OXA-83 enzyme; both have affected >50 hospitals and belong to sequence group 1 (based on ompA, csuE and blaOXA-51-like alleles), which is European clone II. In other countries there may be greater evidence for horizontal gene spread in addition to strain spread, as observed for OXA-72 (an OXA-40-like enzyme) in a Taiwanese hospital. There are few therapeutic options for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant strains other than a polymyxin or glycylcycline and effective infection control remains essential to control their spread and impact.",

Using genetics and biochemistry, we identified the enzyme decaprenylphosphoryl-\u03b2-D-ribose 2'-epimerase as a major BTZ target.

Understanding the relationships between antibiotic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, target organism, site of infection and the potential for resistance development is key for successful patient outcome. Optimizing therapy exploits the specific antibiotic pharmacodynamic parameter that best predicts in vivo efficacy. For example, in the case of \u03b2-lactams, improving the time above the MIC for the targeted pathogen may be accomplished by prolonging the infusion time or utilizing continuous infusion administration. For aminoglycosides, use of high-dose once-daily therapy should increase the Cmax/MIC. Recently, based on the need to improve the performance of vancomycin, higher troughs have been recommended. Higher troughs are needed in order to achieve a higher AUC/MIC ratio which is thought to be important for serious infections like complicated bacteremia, infective endocarditis and pneumonia. Additional factors that affect antibiotic performance include the ability to reach the site of infection (barriers to penetration) and conditions at the site of infection such as pH, protein binding and inoculum. This lecture will discuss specific antibiotic PK/PD characteristics, conditions at the site of infection that diminish antibiotic activity and opportunity to improve performance.",

This, combined with the lack of development of new antimicrobials, necessitates a review of current treatment strategies. Strategies which will be discussed in this symposium will include the benefits of appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment for serious infections, and more rational ways of administration (higher doses and varying infusion times) of some antimicrobials. Resistance development is well monitored in Europe, with resources such as the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS), and additional country and local surveillance (e.g. PEG-surveillance in Germany, Austria and Switzerland). Data will be presented on resistance profiles and evolution rates within the intensive care unit, where the challenge is to contain and prevent the spread of resistance. These data are critical for the rational choice of adequate empirical antibiotic treatment which will not lead to failure. This can be achieved using broad-spectrum, potent agents, which are least likely to select for resistance, before changing to a more targeted therapy (de-escalation) once susceptibilities have been determined. These methods allow us to use our limited armamentarium effectively. If this approach is not followed, the risk of failure and increased mortality associated with initial inadequate antibiotic treatment, the emergence of resistant strains while on therapy, and their subsequent spread to others, are the main consequences. The number of new antibiotics to treat multidrug-resistant pathogens in the pipeline are too few, particularly those against Gram-negative bacteria and those with new mechanisms of action. New strategies are needed to close the gap between the burden of infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria and the development of new antibiotics.",

PK/PD data can be used in Monte Carlo simulations to predict probabilities of obtaining an exposure target for a given dose. Evidence from Monte Carlo simulations, animal models and clinical studies have led to realworld recommendations, such as using extended infusions and other strategies to maximise efficiency of \u03b2-lactams. Prolonged and continuous infusions can give better efficacy, can lower the likelihood of resistance developing through higher trough levels and eliminate or at least reduce the need to increase the dose. \u03b2-lactam antibiotics that can be dosed via continuous/prolonged infusions include penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. However, data should be assessed for each antimicrobial. For example, doripenem exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and does not accumulate with repeated dosing over 7 days, which supports its use as a prolonged infusion. Dr Pea will compare differences between carbapenems and classic \u03b2-lactams. Dosing strategies for different carbapenems will be discussed, including their stability and safety profiles. Practical considerations for prolonged infusions include having knowledge of the relationship of serum levels to target organ levels for different antimicrobials and an awareness of differences in PK and PD parameters among diverse patient groups. Dr Pea will conclude with a discussion on which particular patient populations, such as those with Pseudomonas infection, may benefit most from continuous infusions.

Two possible sources of sexual transmission of HCMV are virus in the female cervix and in semen of men. The frequency of HCMV infection in adults correlates with the number of sexual partners and sexual experience. This \u03b2-herpesvirus is the virus most commonly transmitted to the fetus before birth, occurring in 0.3\u20132% of all live births. Another even much more frequent transmission route of mother-child is breastfeeding. The local viral reactivation of the HCMV antibody positive mothers during lactation is highly frequent and self limited and follows unimodal kinetics. The vertical transmission rate from mother to child is about 40%. Also horizontal HCMV transmission from newborns and young children to their mothers or other individuals taken care of those infants happens. Children may shed the virus in saliva and urine for months or years, but the relative portion of this kind of horizontal transmission from children to children or from children to adults is unknown. Also the horizontal transmission among adults, besides sexual intercourse, is not well descript, but unlikely. In medical care, HCMV can be transmitted by blood products or organ transplantation. As with all other herpesviruses, HCMV has the ability to establish latent/silent infection in the host after primary infection. Activation from silent infection can occur under immunosuppression, during pregnancy and during lactation. Individuals can be infected with multiple strains, meaning secondary infection as exogenous reinfection or endogenous reactivation may occur. HCMV disease with various symptoms can result from either primary or secondary infection, also in primary infection disease is more severe and more frequent. The outcome of congenital HCMV infection is variable. About 10\u201315% of infected newborns exhibit clinical symptoms at birth such as CNS sequelae with hearing loss, cognitive impairment and cerebral palsy. Remarkably from 85\u201390% of HCMV infected newborns who are asymptomatic at birth will later develop hearing loss in about 15%. In both symptomatic and clinical asymptomatic newborns, sequelae often are not apparent in the first months or years of life. That all is an urgent need for specific HCMV diagnostic procedures and interpretations for pregnant women and newborns to guide the solid management of fetal/infant infection.",

However, equivalent studies are yet to be reported for the species formed when carbapenems associate with class A carbapenemases. Using X-ray crystallography we have now studied the interactions of the carbapenem meropenem with a model class A carbapenemase (SFC-1 from Serratia fonticola) in which we have used directed mutagenesis to trap the substrate and acylenzyme complexes. These structures show that SFC-1 binds carbapenems in a single well defined orientation where, in contrast to carbapenem-inhibited enzymes like SHV, the \u03b2-lactam amide nitrogen remains close to the active site Ser-130.

Even carbapenems lose activity when confronted with class C lactamases if the organism also has restricted outer membrane permeability. For example, loss of the OprD outer membrane porin of P. aeruginosa, which is essential for the rapid entry of imipenem into the periplasm, will lead to high-level resistance if a class C \u03b2-lactamase is expressed. In the last decades, a number of AmpC enzymes have been mobilized on plasmids or other genetic elements and have spread to organisms such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae that did not usually express AmpC. Carbapenem-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae that have altered porin expression and a plasmid-encoded AmpC \u03b2-lactamase have been reported from several countries. In general, class C lactamases are not well inhibited by the clinically available \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam.

Different class D \u03b2-lactamase's X-ray structures indicate that the active site Lys-70 is surrounded by a hydrophobic core comprising residues such as Val-117, Phe-120 and Trp-154. Evidence is presented that the interaction between the indole group of Trp154 and the carboxylated lysine is essential for the stability of the post-translationally modified Lys70. Substitution of Trp154 by Gly, Ala or Phe yielded non carboxylated enzymes which displayed poor catalytic efficiencies and reduced stability when compared to the wild type OXA-10. A comparison of the three dimensional structures of the different proteins also indicated that the Trp154 mutations did not modify the overall structures of OXA-10 but induced an increased flexibility of the omega-loop in the active site.",

The observation of acyl-enzyme complex with the K70C mutant by X-ray crystallography also suggests that the deacylation step is rate limiting but the acylation step is also affected for the lysine mutants. Indeed, the values of the acylation constants (k2) are clearly lower than with the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic efficencies of the V117T mutant decrease for all substrates tested. The structure of the V117T OXA-10 mutant indicates that the Lys-70 is partially carboxylated at pH 8.0 in monomer A whereas monomer B contains a non-carboxylated Lys-70.

CA-MRSA is a frequent cause of skin and soft-tissue infections, and has also been reported to cause rapidly progressing life-threatening infections with unusually severe pathology, including necrotizing pneumonia, severe sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. A large number of epidemiological and clinical studies have established a strong association between these severe CA-MRSA infections and strains harbouring the pore-forming toxin Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). Although compelling, epidemiological data alone is insufficient to establish a role of PVL in disease pathogenesis. However, this issue has been addressed in a large number of studies utilizing different experimental systems including PVL-deficient mutants and various in vivo models. The results of these studies have been highly conflicting, and consequently, this topic is a matter of great debate in the staphylococcal field.

Recently, new strains of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) have emerged that affect people with no history of healthcare contact. These are community strains of MSSA that have acquired mecA. They are generally more virulent than HA-MRSA and can cause primary infection in healthy people, including children. CA-MRSA often possess genes encoding the putative virulence factor Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). CA-MRSA clones can be defined by multilocus sequence (ST) and SCCmec type. CA-MRSA have appeared in most countries of the world. They are common in the USA and much less common, but increasing, elsewhere. There are many different clones whose distribution differs geographically. Some are particularly successful. USA300 (ST8-IV PVL+) has replaced USA400 (ST1-IV PVL+) as the commonest type in the USA. The \u2018European clone\u2019 (ST80-IV PVL+) is common in Europe and the \u2018South West Pacific\u2019 clone (ST30-IV PVL+) in the Far East and South America. In Europe there is great clonal diversity and new types are continually being reported, including the pigassociated ST398 strain (usually PVL\u2013) that is common in Denmark and the Netherlands but now spreading elsewhere. Although new CA-MRSA clones continue to appear, successful older ones are being introduced into new geographical areas by travellers and immigrants. CA-MRSA pneumonia is uncommon worldwide but increasing. It may follow influenza in previously healthy people and may cause fatal necrotizing disease, usually associated with PVL-producing CA-MRSA. PVL-positive staphylococci produce necrotizing pneumonia in animal experiments but the role of PVL in human disease is still under debate. Although PVL+ USA300 is the most frequent strain causing pneumonia, this may be because it is common; it remains to be seen whether other types of CA-MRSA, including PVL\u2013 strains, also have this ability. With the continuing spread of CA-MRSA and the on-going influenza pandemic, we can expect the incidence of severe CA-MRSA pneumonia to increase. HA-MRSA pneumonia in ventilated patients is well recognised and has a poor prognosis. CA-MRSA is now spreading in hospitals and becoming increasingly multi-drug resistant (MDR). Physicians should be aware of the threat of hospital-acquired pneumonia with virulent, PVL-producing MDR CA-MRSA and national and international organisations should provide appropriate surveillance systems for CA-MRSA.",

Furthermore, it is indispensable to promote an infection control culture among nurses and physicians to ensure that prevention measures are observed under stress conditions.

In the last decades, different strategies have been developed to prevent microbial colonization of intravascular catheters through surface adsorption or incorporation in the device polymer matrix of antibiotic/antifungal agents. However, the currently available medicated catheters have shown to inhibit microbial biofilm formation for relatively short periods, mainly due to the massive release of the loaded antimicrobial agents in the first 24 h followed by a slow release at sub-inhibitory concentrations until drug exhaustion, this phenomenon involving the risk of emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. To overcome these limitations, we focused our research efforts in developing different experimental approaches to prevent microbial colonization of central venous catheters based on the adsorption of antimicrobial agents to synthesized and properly functionalized polyurethanes with the aim to control drug adsorption and release. Firstly, we have impregnated appropriately functionalized polyurethanes with two antibiotics with different mechanisms of action, rifampicin and cefamandole nafate, along with pore forming agents such as albumin and polyethylene glycol. This in vitro model exhibited a good polymer/antibiotic affinity and the ability to obtain a controlled release of large amounts of antimicrobials for up to 23 days. These results suggest that the entrapping of antibiotic molecules and pore-formers in properly functionalized polyurethanes may represent a promising approach to prevent catheter colonization and onset of bacterial resistance. Other antibiofilm strategies we are dealing with concern: i) the development of antimicrobial polymers by the use of polyurethanes able to coordinate metal ions (Ag+, Zn2+, etc); ii) the exploiting of the biofilm matrix-degrading enzyme, Dispersin B, to allow a better penetration of antibiotics through the microbial biofilm, thus improving their activity; iii) the development of a magnetic nanoparticles-based targeting system to fight catheter-related infections by an in situ, on demand, antimicrobial treatment.",

SOD consisted of four times daily topical application of tobramycin, colistin and amphotericin B in the oropharynx. SDD consisted of SOD and topical application of the same antibiotics in the stomach and four days of intravenous cefotaxime. Cultures of respiratory tract were obtained twice weekly during SDD and SOD, and on clinical indication only during SC. HRMO were defined according to Dutch guidelines. All blood and respiratory tract culture results were evaluated. Results: 5,927 patients were available for analysis: 1,989 (SC), 1,904 (SOD) and 2,034 (SDD). Compared to SC, odds ratios (OR) for ICU-acquired bacteremia were 0.48 (95% CI 0.38\u20130.60) during SDD 0.66 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.82) during SOD. OR for ICU-acquired bacteremia caused by HRMO during SDD were 0.41 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.94) as compared to SC, which corresponds to a rate reduction of 59%, an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 0.6% and a number needed to treat (NNT) of 170. As compared to SOD, the OR for SDD was 0.37 (95% CI 0.16\u20130.85), which corresponds to a rate reduction of 63%, an ARR of 0.7% and a NNT of 145. ICU-acquired colonization of Gram negative bacteria was highest among patients receiving SC. ORs for acquiring HRMO colonization, as compared to SC, were 0.58 (0.43\u20130.78) and 0.65 (0.49\u20130.87) for SDD and SOD respectively, corresponding to 38% and 32% rate reductions, 5.5% and 4.6% ARR and with NNT of 18 and 22, respectively.

            "text": "The class of the azoles have become the most prominent class of compounds for the management of invasive aspergillosis. The clinically licensed triazoles with activity against Aspergillus include itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole. The azoles are also the only drugs that can be administered orally. The azoles interact with the biosynthesis of ergosterol, which is an important component of the fungal cell membrane. Intrinsic resistance to azoles has been documented for A. calidoustus, but the vast majority of species are susceptible in vitro. Recently, Aspergillus species with acquired resistance to azoles have been reported, especially in A. fumigatus. It appears that resistance may develop during azole therapy, especially in patients with chronic therapy including patients with chronic infection and aspergilloma. Another route of resistance development may be exposure of Aspergillus to azole fungicides that are used in our environment. Patients would then inhale azole-resistant conidia and develop azole-resistant aspergillosis. The consequence of this route of transmission is that azole-resistant disease may occur in patients without previous exposure to azole compounds. Azole resistance is commonly due to mutations in the Cyp51A-gene and is associated with different phenotypes. Isolates may be resistant to a single azole compound, but more commonly a cross-resistant phenotype is observed. Several cases of azole-resistant aspergillosis have been reported and commonly these patients failed to respond to azole therapy. Azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates remain virulent and are capable of causing invasive disease in patients at risk. The efficacy of azole compounds against azole-resistant isolates, with different resistance mechanisms, has been investigated in experimental models of invasive aspergillosis. These indicate that the minimal inhibitory concentration has major impact on the efficacy of the azole. Elevated MICs are associated with loss of efficacy of the azole compounds in vivo. The use of azoles should be avoided in patients with azole-resistant aspergillosis, if possible. Alternative agents such as lipid-formulations of amphotericin B or caspofungin appear to retain their efficacy against azole-resistant isolates. A significant problem is the early diagnosis of azole-resistance as in the majority of cases an isolate is not obtained and, if an isolate is cultured, in vitro susceptibility testing causes delay in treatment with effective agents.",

            "text": "The nature of infectious diseases (ID) has changed significantly over the past decades. Many ID have successfully been eradicated through vaccination and the course of some infections has changed due to improved standard of life. On the other hand, changes in life style and longer life expectancy have promoted the emergence and spread of new ID. In spite of rigorous attempts to control hospital care associated infections these infections are becoming a growing problem in modern medicine. The appearance of multiply resistant organisms and the shortage of new antibiotics in the pipeline have placed further demands on developing expertise in the difficult field of antibiotic stewardship. Therefore, the profession of an ID doctor in the 21st century is a very complex one. He or she should have good skills and knowledge in recognizing traditional infectious diseases even those that are believed to be eradicated or not frequent in the area of practice. However, over the past decades infectious diseases with typical clinical presentation and a well defined pathogen have been to a significant extent replaced by infections whose symptoms overlap with the symptoms of the underlying diseases in the same patient or can not be easily differentiated from other causes of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Therefore an ID doctor has to have good communication skills in dealing with other colleagues of different specialties and should be used to work in a team, appreciating different skills brought by different disciplines. From a clinical microbiologist point of view an ideal infectious disease specialist should recognize that the field of clinical microbiology (CM) has undergone the same transformation from mostly research and public health oriented microbiology towards microbiology at the patient bedside. In many patients only individual approach and team work will produce satisfactory diagnosis and treatment of infection. The fact that skills and competencies of modern ID and CM doctors overlap to a greater extent than with other specialties makes a solid ground for a close collaboration and partnership between these two professions. This is important in the field of clinical practice as well as in the field of research. There is a growing number of literature related to infectious diseases and anyone involved in the management of such patients should have a basic knowledge in research methodology and be competent in practicing evidence based medicine.",

            "text": "Nocardiosis is an uncommon bacterial infection with a wide variety of clinical manifestations in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The number of cases reported in the literature is increasing. This might be due to an absolute increase in the number of immunocompromised patients but also to improvement in laboratory techniques to detect nocardiosis. Host resistance to nocardial infection depends on neutrophils in early lesions and then the cell-mediated immune response. The most common predisposing factors to opportunistic nocardia infections are long-term steroid usage, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neoplastic disease, and human immunodeficiency virus infection. Clinical manifestations of nocardiosis range from cutaneous infections caused by traumatic inoculation in normal hosts to severe pulmonary and central nervous system diseases in immunocompromised hosts. The genus of Nocardia is rapidly expanding and the species distribution varies with different geographical locations. Previous studies also emphasized the importance of determining the species of Nocardia, because different species and isolates vary in their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Sulphonamides have been used in the treatment of nocardiosis since the 1940s and are still the drugs of choice and the most common antimicrobials used to treat these infections. Sulphonamide monotherapy, however, was associated with mortality rates of almost 50% for patients with central venous system (CNS) nocardial infections. In addition, patients with non-CNS infections who had overwhelming or disseminated disease had a high mortality rate when treated with sulphonamides alone. However, currently available therapeutic alternatives are scarce and only comprise amoxicillin/clavulanate, carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem) and amikacin. Resistance to previously administered drugs, the toxicity and intolerance of the antimicrobials and even therapeutic failure necessitate the search for alternative agents. Results from in vitro studies suggest that nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a non-fluorinated quinolone, linezolid and tigecycline show promise as alternatives for the treatment of nocardiosis. Further clinical trials are needed to clarify their role in the treatment of these infections.",

An exception is cystic fibrosis (CF) in which the easy accessible purulent sputum coughed up by the patients on a regular basis harbor the bacteria. For the other chronic infections routine sampling has been either using a swab, a scrape or a biopsy, however all might fail to sample the bacteria. In a chronic wound the swab will only collect bacteria on the surface not the bacteria embedded in the wound bed. On the other hand, since the bacteria are very heterogeneously distributed chances are that a biopsy fails to contain any bacteria. Also for implant and catheter related infection diagnosing the bacteria prove difficult. Five to 10 years ago the bacteria on these surfaces and biofilm in general were considered unculturable. Here the problem is surface adherence, the bacteria simply attach extremely well to the surface of the foreign bodies. It is not that they are unculturable, they have to be released from the surface, and vigorously vortexing or even mechanical scraping is not enough.

Unfortunately, a complete and lasting equilibration between blood and tissue cannot always be taken for granted. Drug distribution processes may be characterized by a high intertissue- and intersubject variability and target site drug levels may substantially differ from corresponding plasma levels. Suboptimal target site concentrations may have important clinical implications, as it is a potential explanation for therapeutic failures. In particular for antimicrobial agents knowledge of drug tissue distribution is of primal importance as tissue drug exposure has been shown to be directly related to outcome of therapy. Therefore, determination of drug tissue penetration plays an important role in antimicrobial drug development. Positron emission tomography (PET) is nuclear imaging method, which can be used to study the tissue distribution of drugs labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides, such as carbon-11 or fluorine-18, non-invasively. These types of studies have been termed PET-microdosing studies, as the amount of drug administered in a PET study is usually less than 100 microgram. Due to low administered drug doses, the potential toxicological risk to human subjects is very limited. Consequently regulatory authorities require reduced preclinical safety testing as compared to conventional phase 1 studies.

The preclinical PK assessment provides the input for in vitro and in vivo PK/PD (pharmacodynamic) models that evaluate exposure-effect relationships. Such PK/PD models are powerful tools for dose selection for the clinical phases of drug development. If phase 1 PK data are available, population based PK/PD models support effectively dose selection for late stage clinical trials. Moreover, a PK/PD guided approach can provide decision support for susceptibility breakpoints as well as strategies to mitigate resistance development. Recent late stage clinical failures illustrate the importance of understanding the impact of PKs such as protein binding and concentrations at infection sites and incorporating them early into adequate PK/PD evaluations.",

Diagnosis of the disseminated HAdV disease has been simplified by HAdV load testing in peripheral blood samples using quantitative HAdV PCR.

The reliability of this technology depends largely on the reference database and the algorithm for spectral comparison. Most simply, a sample's spectrum is directly compared to spectra of reference strains and as a result a rated list of matches is provided. A more elaborate approach is realized in the (Spectral Archive and Microbial Identification System (SARAMIS). SARAMIS uses a comprehensive database of mass spectral data of reference strains for automated identification. Two types of spectral data are contained in the database: so called SuperSpectra for fully automated first-line identification (including result transmission) and Reference Spectra for semi-automated second-line identification. The concept of SuperSpectra has been developed in consideration of the natural, intra-specific diversity encountered in all microbial species. This diversity is also reflected in mass spectral fingerprints of individual isolates as variations in peak patterns, which complicates the selection of appropriate reference data. To compute SuperSpectra, spectral fingerprints of a number of 10\u201320 isolates of a species are searched for conserved mass signals that are summarized in a consensus spectrum. In a second step, each mass in the consensus spectrum is compared to the entire reference database to establish its specificity at different taxonomic levels. By doing so, mass signals can be selected that are specific at a desired taxonomic level, e.g., species-specific. By excluding masses from the consensus spectra that are specific only at higher taxonomic levels, the pattern of the remaining masses is highly specific. This makes random matches highly improbable, practically excluding false identifications. The SARAMIS database contains at present 2700 SuperSpectra, representing 900 microbial species. Since SuperSpectra by definition represent typical isolates of a species (not to be confused with type strains), a certain percentage of isolates of a given species will not be captured in automated routine analysis. In this case, the second-line identification starts that applies a direct comparison to all 35,000+ Reference Spectra in the database (representing 1500 species). By this two-step approach basically all clinically, most veterinary and, increasingly, environmental isolates can be reliably identified by a largely automated procedure.",

The number of chronic cases is not known. So far, contact with hay/manure and a house location close to an infected dairy goat farm have been identified as important risk factors for human Q fever. In the affected area dairy goat farming is common and goat density per square kilometre is the highest in the Netherlands. Since 2005 and preceding the human outbreaks, abortion waves caused by C. burnetii have been noticed on 27 dairy goat farms and 2 dairy sheep farms in the regions where most of the human cases occurred. Sampling of incriminated farms, animals and surroundings resulted in detection of C. burnetii. Preliminary MLVA analysis points at spreading of a single clone in goats, however the presence of this clone is not yet widely confirmed in humans. Control measures including mandatory veterinary notification as well as hygiene measures during spread of manure, lambing season and mass vaccination of goats and sheep are being implemented. Preliminary results of the monitoring of vaccination indicate a decrease of the abortion rate in the vaccinated groups to zero and a drop in bulkmilk levels of C. burnetii DNA.",

Furthermore, the lag phase in antibody response to Coxiella burnetii renders serology less suitable for diagnosing early disease. Alternative diagnostic approaches include an ELISA for IgM phase II antibodies as screening assay (M II screen). In addition, IS1111 PCR on serum samples is capable of diagnosing acute Q-fever before antibodies appear. In 2009, we introduced a diagnostic algorithm (figure) for acute Q-fever with the M II screen as initial step. Subsequently, IFA and/or PCR were performed depending on outcome of M II screen, date of onset of disease and inpatient or outpatient setting. When diagnostics were inconclusive a 14-day follow-up serum sample was requested. Here, we evaluated the value of the algorithm in an outbreak setting.",

CCHF virus possesses a negative-sense RNA genome consisting of three RNA segments: the large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments. For an arthropod-borne virus, the genomic plasticity of CCHF virus is surprisingly high. It seems likely that genetic reassortment may primarily occur during coinfection of ticks due to the transient nature of vertebrate infections relative to the long-term persistent virus infections seen in ticks and their obligate need to obtain blood meals at metamorphic junctures. Substantially, movement of genetic lineages of CCHF virus, particularly over greater distances and between regions not linked by livestock trade, likely also involves migratory animals or birds that are either infected or are carrying virus-infected ticks. Consequently, however migratory birds those mediate genetic lineages of CCHF exist critical point for CCHF struggle such as avian influenza, ticks should be targeted at first. Especially, fields with high risk should be out of order for pasturing and disinfected with repellent medicines. Acaricide treatment of livestock in CCHFV endemic areas is effective in reducing the population of infected ticks.",
