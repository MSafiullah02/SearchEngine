Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 have been shown to vary widely, from asymptomatic clinical presentation to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2] [3] [4] . It remains unknown what host factors may affect the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Our recent studies indicated that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) overwhelmed in the severely damaged lungs, while the formation of tissue resident with highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in mildly symptomatic patients suggested a robust adaptive immune response associated with better control of COVID-19 5 . Moreover, a higher titer of antibody in the plasma was independently associated with disease severity in patients with COVID-19 6 . These data suggest that the host immune status, to some extent, may affect the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is lack of direct evidence for immune influence on the acute infection of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report a unique case of COVID-19 with preexisting immune dysfunction from previous coinfection of HIV and HCV, who showed persistently negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test but delayed antibody response in the plasma. COI, which were significantly lower and higher, respectively, than those in patients with COVID-19 who had recovered from the illness. At this time, his SARS-CoV-2 RNA A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t test was still negative from nasopharyngeal and anal swabs. Also, RNAs of influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus were all negative. One week later, 49 days from the onset of illness, his plasma total Ab rose to 523.8 COI while IgM remained at similar levels with 54 COI (Table 1) .",

On March 2, 2020, his CD4 and CD8 T cell counts in peripheral blood were 216 and 584, respectively. On March 9, 2020 his CD4 and CD8 T cell counts were slightly increased and plasma HIV-1 and HCV were both tested negative (Table   1 ). Since the onset of COVID illness in this patient, his close contact partner, an HIV-1-infected person currently taking lopinavir and ritonavir, was tested to be negative for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2-specific total antibody titer was low and IgM was high even after 42 days of illness, which was significantly different from antibody levels in other patients who have recovered from COVID-19 at the similar time points of the illness. Importantly, the total Ab level was largely increased and IgM remained at the peak level one week later, suggesting that the antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in this HIV-1-infected case were delayed. It is possible that there was early incomplete clearance of the virus that induced the subsequently delayed antibody response. Future studies are needed to address the mechanism underlying this delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 with a history of coinfection of HIV-1 infection and HCV, even with the latter being cleared in this case.",

He was treated with oseltamivir and IFN-\u03b1 inhalation. His body temperature rose to 38.3\u2103on January 26, 2020. With oral fluid supplementation and physical cooling, his body temperature became normal. On January 30, 2020 he was discharged with the resolution of right lower pneumonia and three times of negative test of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs by the hospital and Shenzhen CDC. During the hospital course, he had normal laboratory tests, including white blood cell counts, lymphocyte counts, platelet, except that he had slightly elevated plasma CRP on January 26, 2020. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Shenzhen Third People's Hospital(2020-0110). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. Because the patient had a history of co-infection with HIV-1 and HCV four years earlier, on March 2, 2020, 42 days from the onset of his illness, his immune response was evaluated by testing the plasma total antibody (Ab) and IgM Abs specific for SARS-CoV-2 using chemiluminescence kits supplied by Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., China, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specificity of the assays for total Ab and IgM was determined as 99.1% (211/213) and 98.6% (210/213) by testing of samples collected from healthy individuals before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. This test showed total Ab of 13.2 COI and IgM of 49.5",

One potential explanation is that he was taking anti-HIV-1 agents which had been reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects.7 His close contact partner with HIV-1 infection, who was also taking anti-HIV agents, was also tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These data are consistent with the notion that some anti-HIV-1 agents may have preventive and/or therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2. Another possibility is that the activated typeI interferon (IFN-I) may help suppress SARS-CoV-2. Previous study has shown that HIV-1 infection may induce high levels of IFN-I 8 , which may to some extent clear SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus leading to persistently undetectable RNA. Future studies are needed to prove these possibilities.",
