Following PTLD remission and a negative EBV viral load, he received a 3rd kidney transplant with induction immunosuppression (IS) with thymoglobulin, tacrolimus, everolimus and steroids, and maintenance IS with tacrolimus, everolimus and prednisone 5 mg QD.

He reported no other symptoms, nor had a history of travels abroad nor exposure to patients infected or suspected of contagious COVID-19. Previous medical history included an elective splenectomy performed in 2003 due to immune thrombocytopenia, and an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in 2005, treated with rituximab and withdrawal of immunosuppression, achieving complete response of the PTLD, but leading to rejection and failure of the 2nd kidney graft. Following PTLD remission and a negative EBV viral load, he received a 3rd kidney transplant with induction immunosuppression (IS) with thymoglobulin, tacrolimus, everolimus and steroids, and maintenance IS with tacrolimus, everolimus and prednisone 5 mg QD. He was also under treatment with losartan 50 mg bid due to arterial hypertension. At first evaluation in the ER the patient presented signs of mild dehydration. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable, including breath sounds on chest auscultation. On blood workup acute phase reactants were normal, such as a C-reactive protein (CRP) of <0.50 mg/dL (normal range <1.0 mg/dL) and white blood cells (WBC) count of 8.58 \u00d7 10 9 /L, but a mild kidney function impairment (19 is novel infectious disease with an evolving understanding of its epidemiology and clinical manifestations.

The patient was intubated (D+6), with ventilatory supportive care using high positive end-respiratory pressure (PEEP; 12 cm H 2 O). Serum creatinine increased to 2.1 mg/dL (GFR of 30 mL/ min), with tacrolimus through level 10 days after suspension remaining at 5.1 ng/mL. As of today (D+12), the patient remains under respiratory supportive therapy in the ICU, hemodynamically stable, under treatment with Lopinavir/Ritonavir 400/100 mg BID (oral solution-pending a switch to Remdesivir once it is available at the hospital), Interferon Beta (250 mcg every 48 hours; subcutaneous), and Hydroxychloroquine (200 mg BID; oral), with serum creatinine /mL (normal range <500), and procalcitonin of 0.54 ng/mL without further progression of respiratory failure.",

            "text": "A novel coronavirus was identified at the end of the year 2019 in Wuhan, China. There are 7 subtypes of coronaviruses that are infective to humans. Among these, the beta-coronaviruses are associated with potentially severe disease. The International Committeeon Taxonomy of Viruses named this novel virus as Severe Acute F I G U R E 1 Patient's chest X-ray (A) at emergency department following 72 h of first symptoms, and (B) 72 h after admission and prior to need to mechanical ventilation A B Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the World Health Organization (WHO) named the associated as COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which were responsible for past outbreaks with significant morbidity and mortality.2 COVID-19's rapid spread has resulted in an epidemic throughout China and is now globally spreading. So far, 93 090 cases have been diagnosed worldwide.1 In Spain, the first case was diagnosed on January 31, 2020, and to date, 9191 cases have been diagnosed.5 Initially, our patient presented with symptoms of malaise, fever, and vomiting with unremarkable lab tests and no respiratory symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported as part of the initial clinical presentation, but they are rather rare (around 3%-5% depending on the series).2,6,7 Two days later he also had productive cough without dyspnea, and his fever persisted. On the fourth day, he presented conjunctivitis of his left eye. A chest x-ray showed an opacity compatible with right lower lobe pneumonia, and his CRP rose to 13 mg/dL. This is compatible with serious reported cases, where pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection. It is characterized primarily by fever and cough, but it is usually accompanied by dyspnea, and bilateral instead of unilateral infiltrates on chest imaging.7 This could be related to the fact that he had a normal total lymphocyte count, and that the severity of the disease has been associated with lymphopenia.8 His conjunctivitis is also an infrequent symptom, that could be explained by evidence that the virus may be present in conjunctival secretions, with around 0.8% of cases presenting with conjunctival congestion.9-13 Our protocol at patient admission recommended screening for SARS-Cov2 in (1) patients presenting respiratory symptoms and epidemiologic risk of contact with infected or contagious individuals and (2) patients presenting with pneumonia of unknown origin.Nevertheless, in immunocompromised populations, such as SOT recipients, COVID-19 infection should be considered in the presence of an atypical presentation and screening protocols may be needed to be re-evaluated. Hence, and since the increase in the number of cases and evidence of asymptomatic transmission among the community, contact with infected individuals was no longer mandatory.",
