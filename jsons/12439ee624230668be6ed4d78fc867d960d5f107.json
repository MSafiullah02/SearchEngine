Beneficial effects of melatonin have been previously reported in an animal model of acute liver failure (ALF) induced by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). This study was aimed to investigate whether melatonin protection against liver injury induced by the RHDV associates to modulation of autophagy. Rabbits were infected with 2 9 10 4 hemagglutination units of a RHDV isolate and received 20 mg/kg melatonin at 0, 12, and 24 hr postinfection. RHDV induced autophagy, with increased expression of beclin-1, ubiquitin-like autophagy-related (Atg)5, Atg12, Atg16L1 and sequestrosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1), protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) staining, and conversion of LC3-I to autophagosome-associated LC3-II. These effects reached a maximum at 24 hr postinfection, in parallel to extensive colocalization of LC3 and lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP)-1. The autophagic response induced by RHDV infection was significantly inhibited by melatonin administration. Melatonin treatment also resulted in decreased immunoreactivity for RHDV viral VP60 antigen and a significantly reduction in RHDV VP60 mRNA levels, oxidized to reduced glutathione ratio (GSSG/GSH), caspase-3 activity, and immunoglobulin-heavy-chain-binding protein (BiP) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) expression. Results indicate that, in addition to its antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects, and the suppression of ER stress, melatonin induces a decrease in autophagy associated with RHDV infection and inhibits RHDV RNA replication.

Liver transplantation is the only therapy of proven benefit, but the rapidity of progression and the variable course of ALF limit its use [1] . As a result, reproducible experimental animal models resembling the clinical conditions are still needed to test new therapeutic approaches, and ALF presents many challenging opportunities in basic research. Most common models are based on surgical techniques or the use of hepatotoxic drugs and very few satisfactory viral models are available [2] . We have developed a viral model of ALF by means of the inoculation of rabbits with the virus of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHDV), which displays biochemical data, histological characteristics, and clinical features that resemble those in human ALF [3] . In rabbits infected with RHDV melatonin inhibits oxidative damage, apoptotic mechanisms and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [4] [5] [6] [7] , which supports its potential therapeutic use in patients with ALF.

Autophagy is known to participate in both sensing oxidative stress and removing oxidatively damaged proteins and organelles [11] , and plays a multifunctional role in host defense, by promoting pathogen clearance and modulating innate and adaptative immune responses [12] . The process begins with the engulfment of bulk amounts of cytoplasm by double membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, which ultimately fuse with lysosomes, generating an autolysosome in which the constituent is subsequently degraded [13] . At the molecular level the nucleation of the autophagosomal membrane is controlled by a molecular complex containing Bcl-2-interacting protein (beclin)-1, which allows the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate to occur [14] . Conjugation of ubiquitin-like autophagy-related (Atg)12 to Atg5 and formation of a complex with Atg16L1 is required in the elongation of the autophagosome membrane. Autophagosome formation also requires the conversion of cytosolic-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I to the membrane-bound LC3-II form. LC3 then binds to the adaptator protein p62 sequestrosome 1 (p62/ SQSTM1) which, in addition to its role in cell proliferation, inflammation or oxidative stress, facilitates the autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in lysosomes [13, 15] . The interplay between autophagy and programmed cell death is complex, and recent data suggest the existence of a cross talk between autophagic and apoptotic pathways [16] . Some studies have demonstrated that autophagy may have an active contribution to cell death in virus infected cells [17] . However, there are also reports that autophagy can prolong survival of virus-infected cells by counteracting the apoptotic response [18, 19] . Given the well-known regulatory effect that melatonin has on apoptotic cell death, and the dual capabilities of autophagy to induce survival or death depending on cellular stress [20] , melatonin modulation of autophagy is currently under consideration [21] , and the regulatory role of the indol on the process of autophagy deserves further careful studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 199, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 200, "end": 203, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 330, "end": 334, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 715, "end": 719, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 950, "end": 954, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1518, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1522, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1695, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1818, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1957, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1961, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2143, "end": 2147, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2217, "end": 2221, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this research, we analyzed whether melatonin administration modulates the autophagic response in RHDV-infected rabbits.

Data obtained indicate a progressive increase in the extent of labeling in RHDV-infected animals which reached a maximum at 36 hpi (Fig. 1A,B) in parallel to the increase in RHDV mRNA level (Fig. 1C) . Melatonin treatment resulted in decreased immunoreactivity and significantly reduced RHDV mRNA expression (Fig. 1A-C) , revealing an inhibitory role of the indol on RHDV replication. Viral replication associated to increased expression of the phosphorylated form of IRF7, a master regulator of type I-interferon-dependent innate immunity, and this effect was not modified by melatonin administration (Fig. 1D) . Autophagy activation by RHDV infection was confirmed by the significant increase of beclin-1 expression and the upregulation of components of the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L1 complex at 18-24 hpi ( Table 2 ). Another frequently used autophagy marker is LC3, which is converted from the cytosolic form LC3-I to the lapidated form LC3-II. Western blot data indicate that LC3-II expression increased markedly at 18-24 hpi, with a maximum rise of LC3-II/ LC3-I ratio at 24 hpi, which suggests that RHDV could be blocking the autophagic process in liver cells at early postinfection periods (Fig. 2A) . Effects on LC3 expression can reflect aggregated effects of induced autophagosome synthesis, decreased fusion with lysosomes and/or suppression of proteolytic turnover in the autophagolysosomes. Immunoflourescence analysis showed spots of green fluorescence which reached a maximum at 24 hpi, suggest- ing an elevated turnover of autophagosomes (Fig. 2B) . At 18 hpi, there was little colocalization between LC3 and the lysosomal marker LAMP-1, but extensive overlap was observed at 24 hpi, presumably due to increased accumulation of autophagolysosomes. However, the parallel increase in p62/SQSTM1 mRNA levels ( Table 2 ) may reflect a dysfunctional autophagy with impairment of the autophagic flux. The autophagic response in RHDV-infected rabbits was partially inhibited by melatonin treatment, as shown by the reduced LC3 immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 2B) , the decrease in LC3-II protein expression ( Fig. 2A) , and the diminished mRNA expression of beclin-1, Atg5, Atg12 and Atg16L1 (Table 2) . Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been reported to induce the accumulation of autophagosomes, and autophagy may be an important part of normal ER function [25] . We have previously reported that melatonin treatment inhibits ER stress at 36 hpi in RHDV-infected rabbits [7] . During ER stress different transcription factors regulate the expression of ER chaperones that enhance the folding capacity of the ER, including CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and immunoglobulin-heavy-chain-binding protein (BiP/GRP78).

One of the typical stress responses initiated by viral infection is ER stress, which down-regulates protein synthesis through the three branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR). During ER stress, different transcription factors regulate the expression of ER chaperones, such as CHOP and BiP, which enhance the folding capacity of the ER [7] .

Thus, previous studies have demonstrated that autophagy is associated to ER stress in HCV infection, and that persistent induction of ER stress and incomplete activation of autophagy play an important role in HCV pathogenesis [28, 31] . In addition, a newer hypothesis that is gaining support is that autophagic activities are sensitive to oxidative stress and to the generation of reactive species [11] . Indeed, a recent research has shown that oxidative stress triggers the accumulation of autophagic compartments without increasing the degradation of long-lived proteins in human neuroblastoma cells infected by herpes simplex virus type 1 infection [32] . Moreover, it has been reported that in MEF cells infected with the Chikungunya virus, independent induction of ER and oxidative stress pathways triggers autophagy through the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [18] . Therefore, the previously reported reduction of oxidative stress and ER stress by melatonin [7, 26] , confirmed in this research through the decrease in CHOP and BiP expression and the increase in the GSSG/GSH ratio, could contribute to the inhibitory effect of the indol on the autophagic response induced by viral infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 289, "end": 293, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 294, "end": 297, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 462, "end": 466, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 717, "end": 721, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 954, "end": 958, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1056, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1060, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our research, the autophagic activity induced by the RHDV declined in late periods of infection (30-36 hpi) in parallel to the increase in apoptosis. Different studies have previously shown that virally induced autophagy is capable of preventing the early apoptotic death of cells [33] , which suggests that autophagy might contribute to limit the cytopathic effect of viruses and the pathological consequences associated with cell death triggered by viral infection. This regulation of programmed cell death by autophagy could also be present in RHDV-infected hepatocytes. However, mechanisms responsible for the regulation of apoptosis by autophagy and for the overhelming of the apoptotic response by the inhibitory effect of autophagy remain unknown. Melatonin is able to induce or inhibit autophagy based on cellular necessities and oxidative stress levels. There are reports that autophagy and survival are significantly enhanced in ischemic N2a cells treated with melatonin [34] , and melatonin-induced autophagy protects against human prion protein-mediated neurotoxicity [35] . Moreover, melatonin induces autophagy and results in the effective removal of mutant-TGFBIp from granular corneal dystroph type 2 fibroblasts [36] . In contrast, melatonin is known to protect HeLa cells from rotenone-induced cell injury via inhibition of autophagy [37] , to suppress cyclosporine A-induced autophagy in rat pituitary GH3 cells [38] , to inhibit kainic acid-induce neurotoxicity in mouse hippocampus via inhibition of autophagy [39] , and to attenuate methamphetamine-induced autophagy [40] . Consistent with studies which report parallel inhibition of autophagic processes and programmed cell death, in the present experiments both autophagy and apoptosis were significantly inhibited by melatonin. These effects of the indol could be the consequence of its antioxidant action, which may directly antagonize mechanisms contributing both to the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis [6] , but also result in the inhibition of ER stress and, in turn, in diminished autophagic and apoptotic responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 99, "end": 110, "text": "(30-36 hpi)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 284, "end": 288, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 984, "end": 988, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1087, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1236, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1359, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1438, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1538, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1596, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1997, "end": 2000, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "An additional interesting fact concerns the inhibition of RHDV induced by melatonin. The role of autophagy in relation to viral replication is dual and it may be beneficial to virus or host. Thus, although autophagy may be a cellular mechanism to clear viral infection, and its inhibition results in an increased replication and virulence of herpex simplex virus 1 (HSV1) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), different viruses appear to use this response to enhance their own replication. It has been reported that the double membrane of the autophagosome supports poliovirus replication [41] , the autophagic machinery is used for coronaviruses replication [42] , HCV uses autophagy for the early protein translation [43] , and Dengue virus activate autophagy to elevate viral replication [44] . Moreover, it is known that ER stress may play a positive role in HCV RNA replication through activation of autophagy, because siRNAs directed against sensors of the different branches of the UPR suppress HCV-induced lipidation of LC3, required for formation of autophagosomes, and reduce HCV RNA levels [28] . It has also been reported that inhibitors of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1), one of the ER stress mediators, inhibit in parallel HCV viral replication and autophagy in hepatoma cells [45] . Therefore, data obtained in this study could indicate that the decrease in RHDV RNA replication in melatonin-treated rabbits is a consequence, at least in part, of its negative effect on ER stress and on the autophagic response. Both HCV and Dengue virus are known to exploit the UPRautophagy pathway to promote replication by suppressing innate antiviral immunity [46, 47] , and a number of in vitro and in vivo studies have documented that melatonin plays a role in innate immunity [48] . However, in our experiments expression of the phosphorylated form of IRF7, a potent type I interferon inducer capable of modulating viral propagation in infected hepatocytes [49] , increased in RHDV-infected rabbits and was not modified by melatonin. This suggests that RHDV is not able to abrogate type I interferon-dependent immune responses, and inhibition of viral replication by melatonin is probably unrelated to induction of innate immunity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 588, "end": 592, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 658, "end": 662, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 718, "end": 722, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 790, "end": 794, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1104, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1291, "end": 1295, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1667, "text": "[46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1671, "text": "47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1786, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1963, "end": 1967, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, results from this study indicate that in addition to its anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects, and the suppression of ER stress, melatonin induces a decrease in the autophagy associated with RHDV infection and inhibits RHDV RNA replication.
