With over 200 hereditary disease pathologies reported in the cat, the clinical and physiological study of these feline hereditary diseases provides a strong comparative medicine opportunity for prevention, diagnostics, and treatment studies in a laboratory setting. Causal mutations have been characterized in 19 felid genes, with the largest representation from lysosomal storage enzyme disorders. Corrective therapeutic strategies for several disorders have been proposed and examined in the cat, including enzyme replacement, heterologous bone marrow transplantation, and substrate reduction therapy. Genomics tools developed in the cat, including the recent completion of the 2-fold whole genome sequence of the cat and genome browser, radiation hybrid map of 1793 integrated coding and microsatellite loci, a 5-cM genetic linkage map, arrayed BAC libraries, and flow sorted chromosomes, are providing resources that are being utilized in mapping and characterization of genes of interest. A recent report of the mapping and characterization of a novel causative gene for feline spinal muscular atrophy marked the first identification of a disease gene purely from positional reasoning. With the development of genomic resources in the cat and the application of complementary comparative tools developed in other species, the domestic cat is emerging as a promising resource of phenotypically defined genetic variation of biomedical significance. Additionally, the cat has provided several useful models for infectious disease. These include feline leukemia and feline sarcoma virus, feline coronavirus, and Type C retroviruses that interact with cellular oncogenes to induce leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma.",

            "text": "Although previous versions of the cat gene map, based on somatic cell hybrid and ZOO FISH analysis, 15 ,16 revealed considerable conservation of synteny with the human genome, these maps provided no knowledge of gene order or intrachromosomal genome rearrangement between the two species, information that is critical to applying comparative map inference to gene dis covery in gene-poor model systems. Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping has emerged as a powerful tool for constructing moderate-to high-density gene maps in vertebrates by obviating the need to identify interspecific polymorphisms critical for the generation of genetic linkage maps. 7 The most recent RH map of the cat 8 includes 1793 markers: 662 coding loci, 335 selected markers derived from the cat 2X whole genome sequence targeted at breakpoints in conserved synteny between human and cat, and 797 short tandem repeat (STR) loci. The strategy used in developing the current RH map was to target gaps in the feline-human comparative map, and to provide more definition in breakpoints in regions of conserved synteny between cat and human. The 1793 markers cover the length of the 18 feline autosomes and the X chromosome at an average spacing of one marker every 1.5 Mb (megabase), with fairly uniform marker density. 8 An enhanced comparative map demonstrates that the current map provides 86% and 85% comparative coverage of the human and canine genomes, respectively. 8 Ninety-six percent of the 1793 cat markers have identifi able orthologues in the canine and human genome sequences, providing a rich comparative tool, which is critical in linkage mapping exercises for the identification of genes controlling feline phenotypes. Figure 25 -1 presents a graphic display of each cat chromosome and blocks of conserved syntenic order with the human and canine genomes. 8 One hundred and fifty-two cat-human and 134 cat-dog homologous synteny blocks were identified. Alignment of cat, dog, and human chromosomes demonstrated different patterns of chromosomal rearrangement with a marked increase in interchromosomal rearrangements relative to human in the canid lineage (89% of all rearrangements), as opposed to the more frequent intrachromosomal rearrangements in the felid lineage (95% of all rearrangements) since divergence from a common carnivore ancestor 55 My ago.",

The map has been generated in a large multigeneration domestic cat pedigree (n = 483 informative meioses). 18 Previous first-and second-generation linkage maps of the cat were generated in a multigeneration interspecies pedigree generated between the domestic cat and the Asian leopard cat, Prionailurus bengalensis, 7 to facilitate the mapping and integration of Type I (coding) and Type II (polymorphic STR) loci. 7 The current map, which spans all 18 autosomes with single linkage groups, has twice the STR density of previous maps, providing a 5-cM resolution. There is also greatly expanded coverage of the X chromosome, with some 75 STR loci. Marker order between the current generation RH and GL maps is highly concordant. 8 Approximately 85% of the STRs are mapped in the most current RH map of the cat, 8 which provides reference and integration with Type I loci. Whereas the third-generation linkage map is composed entirely of STR loci, the sequence homology of extended genomic regions adjacent to the STR loci in the cat 2X whole genome sequence, 17 to the dog's homologous region, 19 has enabled us to obtain identifiable orthologues in the canine and human genome sequences for over 95% of the STRs. Thus, practically every STR acts as a \"virtual\" Type 1 locus, with both comparative anchoring and linkage map utility. Combined with the cat RH map, these genomic tools provide us with the comparative reference to other mammalian genomes critical for linkage and association mapping.",

However, with the availability of a detailed comparative map, and integration with developing GL and RH maps, and the cat 2X whole genome sequence, linkage and association-based mapping techniques have recently identified causative mutations for hereditary disease genes, 33, 34 as well as several feline phenotypes (Table 25-1) . 18, 32, Once a genomic region is implicated from association-based or linkage mapping exercises, fine mapping has been accomplished by development of new STRs or SNPs in the targeted region using the cat 2X whole genome sequence data accessed sequence tagged sites (STS), utilizing sequence information from the cat 2X whole genome sequencing effort, which ultimately identifi ed an \u223c140 kb deletion and a novel gene candidate, LIX1 34 ( Figure 25-4) . Though the function of LIX1 is unknown, the predicted secondary structure is compatible with a role in RNA metabolism. An exon sequence screen of 25 human SMA cases, not otherwise explicable by mutations at the SMN1 locus, failed to identify comparable LIX1 mutations. 34 The SMN1 gene product, SMN, is a ubiquitously expressed protein member of multiple ribonucleoprotein complexes with diverse roles in RNA metabolism, splicing, and transport in all cells. 62, 63 A central focus of SMA research remains to discern the disease mechanism(s) and to understand why the primary disease pathology is localized to spinal lower motor neurons when all cells require SMN function. LIX1 expression is largely restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), primarily in spinal motor neurons, thus offering an explanation of the tissue restriction of pathology in feline SMA. Determination of LIX1 function may well provide fresh insight into the mechanisms of human SMA pathology, impetus for more targeted therapeutics, and answers to fundamental questions of motor neuron development, maintenance, and/or function. through the cat genome browser, GARFIELD. 17 A recent report of the mapping and characterization of a novel gene causative of feline spinal muscular atrophy 34 marked the first identification of a disease gene purely from positional reasoning. Human spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of neuropathies that varies in clinical severity, from lethal in infancy to onset of mild weakness in adulthood, but all are characterized by neurogenic muscle atrophy due to degeneration of lower motor neurons of the spinal cord. 58 For approximately 97% of people affected with SMA, disease pathology is attributable to a mutation in the SMN1 gene, on human chromosome 5q13, which is subject to a high frequency of deletions and gene conversion events with the divergent and only partially functional centromeric copy/copies of the duplicated SMN2 locus. 59, 60 A domestic cat model of SMA has been described that is a model of autosomal recessive juvenile-onset SMA. 61 With the feline SMN gene excluded as the disease locus, 61 a full genome linkage scan was conducted in a pedigree segregating for SMA. 61 The disease phenotype was linked to chromosome A1q, 34 in a region of conserved synteny to human chromosome 5q15.

The result is a comprehensive veterinary literature that has described over 200 feline hereditary pathologies 17 (http://www.angis.org.au/). The clinical and physiological study of these feline hereditary diseases provides a strong comparative medicine opportunity for prevention, diagnostics, and treatment studies in a laboratory setting. Additionally, large animal homologues are similar to humans in natural genetic diversity and offer the possibility of evaluating long-term effects of treatment. 64 To date, causal mutations have been characterized in 19 felid genes that cause hereditary disease (Table 25 -1). The largest representation comes from lysosomal storage enzyme disorders that arise from defects in genes playing a role in degradation of macromolecules targeted to the lysosomes. Many of the genes that cause these pathologies have been mapped in the cat. 65 Corrective therapeutic strategies have been proposed and examined in the cat, including enzyme replacement, heterologous bone marrow transplantation, and substrate reduction therapy. 64, 66 Limitations to these treatment strategies include high morbidity and mortality, limited positive outcomes, incomplete response to therapy, cost, and in some cases requirements for continuous lifelong therapy. 66 Gene therapy poses the most recent of intervention strategies. Feline models have been important in elucidating molecular pathogenesis and are now playing a critical role in evaluating and optimizing the range of therapeutic strategies prior to clinical trials in humans.",

            "text": "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I), which results from a genetic deficient activity of the enzyme \u03b1-l-iduronidase (IDUA), can lead to mental retardation, growth abnormalities, and shortened life span in humans. 67 Naturally occurring models have been characterized in the cat 68,69 and dog. 70 Immune responses can nullify the effect of gene corrective therapy. It has been demonstrated that cats, but not dogs, mount a potent CTL response to canine IDUA after neonatal gene therapy, which can be prevented with transient CTLA4-Ig. 71 The efficacy of neonatal retroviral therapy has also been explored in the cat. 66 The cat model, additionally, provides an ideal system to study mechanisms of brain neurodegeneration and neural-directed strategies, especially given a large body of preexisting literature on cat neurology. MPS VI or Marteaux-Lamy disease, deficient activity of arylsulfatase B (ARSB), is characterized in humans and cats with growth retardation, coarse facial features, corneal opacity, and skeletal deformities. [72] [73] [74] [75] The feline model also exhibits abnormal lysosomal storage in occasional neurons and glia distributed throughout the cerebral cortex. 76 Fibroblast-mediated in vitro gene therapy has been examined in this cat model. 77 Recently, an adeno-associated vector containing feline ARSB has demonstrated gene therapy-based correction of corneal clouding in the MPS VI cat. 78 MPS VII results from deficiency of \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUSB), which in humans manifests as cartilaginous and bony malformations, growth and mental retardation, abdominal organ enlargement, and corneal clouding. 79 Naturally occurring animal models have been described in mice, 80 dogs, 81 and the cat. 82 Enzymatic activity has been restored in fibroblasts and restored by retroviral gene transfer of rat GUSB cDNA. As GUSB is an essential housekeeping enzyme, this feline model is important for examination of exogenous genes and gene product delivery to a variety of tissue types, and could prove especially valuable due to extensive research conducted on the anatomy and physiology of the cat central nervous and visual systems. Three different serotypes of adeno-associated viral constructs of GUSB demonstrated the efficacy of this vector to achieve gene transfer in the normal cat brain, as a model for the efficacy of this construct in a large mammalian brain. 83 Defi ciency of lysosomal \u03b1-mannosidase leads to an accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides, 84 which leads to mental retardation, recurrent infections, skeletal changes and hearing impairment. 85 This feline model was initially important in achieving bone marrow transplantation as corrective strategy for neuronal storage diseases of the CNS. 86, 87 Recently, adeno-associated viral (AAV) constructs of feline \u03b1-mannosidase were used to demonstrate the efficacy of CNS gene therapy. Treated cats exhibited widespread improvement of neuropathology, showing the effi cacy of this treatment in a large mammalian brain for CNS correction of human lysosomal enzyme defi ciencies. 88 Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a crucial enzyme involved in the regulation of lipoprotein and lipid metabolism ability to thrive. 89 Cats with LPL deficiency display a remarkably similar phenotype to humans, including severe pancreatitis, chylomicronemia, and failure to thrive. 46 There is currently no adequate treatment for this pathology in humans. Cats could prove to be the most valuable animal model of LPL deficiency, as of numerous animal model systems examined including the mouse, the cat most closely resembles the lipoprotein pattern and lipid transport system of humans. Recently, AAV-mediated transfer of a human LPL S447X variant into feline muscle cells demonstrated correction of the hypertriglyceridemia associated with feline pathology; this offers much promise for treatment of human LPL defi ciency. 90 A separate class of lysosomal storage disorder characterized in the cat is the gangliosidoses, G M1 and G M2 , which are heritable neurodegenerative diseases. A deficiency of lysosomal \u03b2-galactosidase results in the neuronal accumulation of the G M1 ganglioside, while the degradation of the G M2 ganglioside is initiated by coordinated action of at least three gene products, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 submits of \u03b2-N-acetylhexosaminidase and the G M2 activator (GM2A) protein. 42, 91 Mutations in any of these enzymes result in an accumulation of gangliosides G M1 and G M2 in the lysosomes of affected neurons, resulting in progressive deterioration of the CNS. Feline models have been especially important in characterizing the pathobiology and molecular biology of these diseases. G M2 -gangliosidosis has been characterized in cat models defi cient in the G M2 activator protein and HexB, 40, 42, 92, 93 exhibiting remarkably similar pathology to human Sandhoff's disease. 91 Limited reduction in G M2 neuronal storage has been reported following bone marrow therapy. 86 Feline models will be important in the development of therapeutic strategies for these disorders.",

Compared to traditional murine models, the cat's more similar physiology, increased size, and longevity have made it ideal for testing the safety and efficacy of some therapeutic modalities in naturally occurring feline disease models. [107] [108] [109] [110] Additionally, cats have a genetically heterogeneous background, similar to humans. A good example of a human disease in need of a better mammalian model is cystic fibrosis, as mice targeted with the most common human mutation (\u2206F508) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR) fail to spontaneously develop the same opportunistic lung infections that plague human patients with cystic fi brosis. 111, 112 One group has been working to produce a ferret cystic fibrosis model through gene targeting of somatic cells for nuclear transfer. 113, 114 While reproductive cloning has a consistently low success rate (1-4%) across mammalian species, 115 targeting genetic loci through homologous recombination in somatic cells is currently the only viable method for producing knockout models in all mammalian species other than the mouse, for which targeted embryonic stem cells are routinely used. Nuclear transfer of targeted fibroblasts has been successfully used to produce viable \u03b1-1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout pig and cow models for xenotransplantation studies. 116, 117 With the successful reproductive cloning of cats by several groups, 118-120 the development of gene-targeted cat models through nuclear transfer is now feasible. 121 The imminent release of the annotated feline genome project, 17 integration of recombination and radiation hybrid maps, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 122 and availability of multiple PAC, BAC, 123 flow-sorted autosome, and Y-chromosome libraries 124, 125 (J.

Genes involved in these processes often have pleiotropic effects, which impact other important biochemical pathways. Coat color loci in the mouse have been known to be part of diverse cellular, developmental, and physiological processes and in some cases to be implicated in pathologies such as anemia, sterility, and neurological disorders. [126] [127] [128] The cat is an excellent model system with which to study coat color phenotypes. At least nine different coat color loci have been identified in the cat, 129 and several are now characterized on a molecular genetic level including, a (nonagouti) responsible for melanism, 18 b (Brown), which changes black pigmentation to brown or variants of brown, 32 c (color), causing the darker pigmentation at extremities (i.e., ears, tail), observed in Siamese and Burmese cats 32,37 and albinism, 36 and d (dilute), which causes dilution of expected color (i.e., black pigmentation appears gray). 35 The cat is also unique in mammalian species in exhibiting a variation in coat pattern, demonstrating agouti (A) (nonpatterned coat) and variants of the T (tabby) locus, which affect striping and spotting patterns.",

            "text": "The cat has provided several useful models for infectious disease. These include feline leukemia and feline sarcoma virus, feline coronavirus, and Type C retroviruses that interact with cellular oncogenes to induce leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma. [130] [131] [132] Historically, many of the human oncogenes that defi ne signal transduction pathways were originally discovered in the context of feline leukemia virus interaction in cat models. The cat provides the only naturally occurring model for human AIDS pathogenesis, in its endemic fatal transmissible feline immunodefi ciency virus (FIV). 133, 134 Similar to its close phylogenetic relative HIV, FIV induces CD4-T lymphocyte depletion in affected cats, an immune system collapse, and susceptibility to adventitious microbial agents as a prelude to wasting disease and death. 133, 135 Interestingly, over 10 wildcat species (including lions, leopards, cheetahs, ocelots, pumas and other big cats) are endemic with their own species-specific strain of FIV [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] ; however, unlike strains in domestic cats, the wildcat FIV strains do not appear to cause acute immunodeficiency in the wildcat species, perhaps a consequence of historic natural selection of host genetic resistance to the fatal virus. 139, 142 Lion and puma-specific FIV strains have recently been demonstrated to utilize novel, more promiscuous mechanisms for cell entry than FIV, suggesting a divergent tropism and biological properties of these viruses. 143 The World Health Organization reported a new human respiratory illness outbreak (severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS) that emerged in Guangdong Province, China in 2003. 144, 145 Sequence analysis demonstrated that the infectious agent was a previously unrecognized coronavirus. 146, 147 An animal model demonstrating clinical symptoms and pathology of SARS-infected patients has not been reported. 148 Of interest, the recent report of a highly virulent feline coronavirus epidemic in captive African cheetahs, a disease model for human SARS, illustrates the critical role of ancestral population genetic variation. 132 In addition, cats injected with the SARS virus developed clinical symptoms, an important insight in implicating the virus in the SARS epidemic. [149] [150] [151] [152] The feline panleukopenia (feline distemper) virus has revealed a natural history parable in its abrupt transformation of the cat virus to an epidemic, fatal canine parvovirus, that emerged in the world's puppy population in 1978. 153 In contrast, the canine distemper virus, which is normally restricted to canid species, precipitously adapted to and decimated East African lions in 1994, killing one-third of the lions in the Serengeti ecosystem within a 9-month outbreak. 154 A clear involvement of host defense mecha- nisms in these and other infectious disease episodes renders the cats and their pathogens an excellent candidate species for characterizing the interaction of microbial adaptation and host disease gene defenses. Given the critical importance of infectious disease in scores of chronic and acute human disease, there are powerful research opportunities in the cat family. 142, 155 Finally, recent concern over the emergence of avian flu H5N1 has shown a strong susceptibility of cats, both domestic and large cats, again raising possibilities for pathogenesis and therapy development. 156, 157 With the development of genomic resources in the cat (Table  25 -2) and the application of complementary comparative tools developed in other species, the domestic cat is emerging as a promising resource of phenotypically defined genetic variation of biomedical significance. Exploration of similar resources in other species, particularly the dog and mouse, has provided important insight into otherwise unexplained biomedical disorders.",

Arrows indicate the direction of transcription of each gene. The scale of chromosome coordinates is from the region of conserved synteny in the dog genome (CFA 3) (UCSC Genome Browser; July 2004 assembly). Sequences of the deleted and normal alleles are aligned showing the precise breakpoints below the schematic. The immediately fl anking 6-bp sequence, AGTTTA, is in bold. (Note that the genome browser did not itself identify exon 1 of LNPEP by homology with RefSeq genes, but limited homology was identified by BLAT search of the dog genome with a cat sequence that was 82% identical over 300 bp of the human exon 1 and flanking 5\u2032-UTR and intron 1 sequences.) (B) PCR products produced from genomic DNA in a multiplex reaction designed to amplify across both deletion breakpoints when the normal allele (lane N) was present. A third product corresponding to the affected cat sequence shown in (A) was amplified when the deleted allele was present, either in homozygous affected (lane A) or heterozygous carrier (lane C) cats. (C) RT-PCR products amplifi ed from cervical spinal cord ventral horn RNA of a genetically normal cat (lane N), a clinically normal carrier (lane C), and an SMA affected cat (lane A). PCR primers for LIX1 were from exons 1 and 4, LNPEP primers were from exons 14 and 15, and GAPDH primers were from exons 6 and 8.
