As has been clearly documented, the transmission of MRSA has increased with the growth of international travel, resulting in either asymptomatic colonization or clinically significant MRSA infections.3, 4 Some evidence is also available for the international dissemination of VRE via transfer/repatriation of patients from hospitals located in endemic areas.5 Concerning Gram-negative organisms, the impact of international travel has been firmly established in the dissemination of MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including high-risk clones producing ESBLs (especially enzymes of the CTX-M type) and/or carbapenemases of various types (e.g., KPC, OXA-48, NDM, VIM).6, 7, 8 The risk of the spread of MDR strains of Enterobacteriaceae in this situation includes not only Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, and Enterobacter spp, but also classical enterobacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica and Shigella spp, with evidence of imported cases of typhoid fever and shigellosis caused by MDR strains.8, 9 The transmission of MDR Acinetobacter has been documented following the international transfer of patients from intensive care units (ICUs) in countries with high-level endemicity,10 and the repatriation of evacuees involved in military operations in endemic areas.11 Less evidence is available for the travel-related dissemination of MDR/XDR P. aeruginosa strains, but this is clearly a possibility following the transfer of colonized patients from ICUs where these strains are endemic or are causing outbreaks.12\n",

When consulting sources of information regarding resistance and endemicity (such as ProMED-mail, http://www.promedmail.org), clinicians should consider that (1) for several countries (especially low-income settings) epidemiological information is scarce or lacking, and (2) the epidemiology of MDR/XDR pathogens can change rapidly.

Ninety-one percent of patients had fever. The median time from travel to presentation was 16 days. Thirteen (0.4%) patients died: 10 with falciparum malaria, two with melioidosis, and one with severe dengue. Falciparum malaria was mainly acquired in West Africa, enteric fever on the Indian subcontinent, and leptospirosis, scrub typhus, and murine typhus in Southeast Asia.24\n",
