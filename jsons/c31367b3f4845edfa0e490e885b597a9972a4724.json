It is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China. It has been seen that fewer children contract COVID-19 and among infected, children have less severe disease. Insights in pathophysiological mechanisms of less severity in children could be important for devising therapeutics for high-risk adults and elderly. Early closing of schools and day-care centers led to less frequent exposure and hence, lower infection rate in children. The expression of primary target receptor for SARS-CoV-2, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), decreases with age. ACE-2 has lung protective effects by limiting angiotensin-2 mediated pulmonary capillary leak and inflammation. Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with high and persistent viral loads in adults. Children have strong innate immune response due to trained immunity (secondary to live-vaccines and frequent viral infections), leading to probably early control of infection at the site of entry. Adult patients show suppressed adaptive immunity and dysfunctional over-active innate immune response in severe infections, which is not seen in children. These could be related to immune-senescence in elderly. Excellent regeneration capacity of pediatric alveolar epithelium may be contributing to early recovery from COVID-19. Children, less frequently, have risk factors such as co-morbidities, smoking, and obesity. But young infants and children with pre-existing illnesses could be high risk groups and need careful monitoring. Studies describing immune-pathogenesis in COVID-19 are lacking in children and need urgent attention.",

As COVID-19 has similarities to SARS, some findings from SARS CoV-1 pathogenesis are extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This is probably due to less viral shedding before symptom onset, by which time they were most probably seeking medical care [21] . It is estimated that transmission between family members occurred in only 13-21% of MERS cases and 22-39% of SARS cases [21] . The secondary attack rates reported for COVID-19 vary from 10 to 20% [22] [23] [24] .",

One possible explanation is that the latter were associated with high CFR and started as outbreaks, which led to strict quarantine procedures and closing of potential hotspots for pediatric infections like schools and daycare centers. As movement of children is highly limited in these times, most of the infections are spread from infected adult family members. Even within families, individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection are isolated, which may reduce exposure of children. Among studies of household contacts, odds of infection in children were significantly less than elderly (OR: 0.26, 95%CI 0.13-0.54) and gradually increased with age [23, 24] .",

SARS-CoV-2 titres in nasopharyngeal and endotracheal aspirate specimens are high during first week of symptoms followed by gradual decline starting at end of first week [32] [33] [34] [35] . In nasopharyngeal swabs from 76 patients, viral loads were significantly higher in severely affected (approximately 60 times) than mildly affected patients [36] . Another study found that patients with severe illness had approximately 1 log 10 higher viral titres (not statistically significant) [33] . A small series found no difference in viral loads between mild and severe disease. But the authors analyzed plasma RNAaemia and included only 2 and 4 patients with RNAaemia in severe and mild illness, respectively [37] . After approximately 4-7 d, a proportion of patients enter critical phase which is associated with progressive decline in viral titres and worsening of inflammatory markers. Patients with more severe disease have less steep and prolonged decline in viral titres [33] . Levels of inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, GCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-\u03b1 are higher in critically ill patients than patients with mild disease [37, 38] . Number of T-cells, helper T-cells, and memory helper T-cells are decreased and na\u00efve helper T-cells is increased in severe group compared to mild group [39] . Increase in IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 antigens [internal nucleoprotein (NP) and receptor binding protein (RBP)] was seen around day 7-10 of symptoms, followed by gradual decrease in viral load [33, 34] . The persistent high virus titres, poorly controlled by dysfunctional immune system with elevated cytokine levels, point towards combined effect of virus mediated cytopathic effects and immune-mediated injury as the pathway of severe lung injury and multi-organ dysfunction during critical phase. Patients can succumb to illness during critical phase or gradually recover.",

In healthy state, ACE-2 activity maintains homeostasis between angiotensin-2 (vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis and proliferation) and Ang-(1-7) pathways (vasodilatation, anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrosis, and anti-proliferation) [45] . After entering pneumocytes, SARS-CoV-2 downregulates ACE-2 expression, decreasing angiotensin-2 metabolism. Elevated angiotensin-2 increases pulmonary vascular permeability and inflammation, hence worsening of lung injury [21, 46] . Angiotensin-2 levels have been found to be increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy adults [32] . Angiotensin-2 levels have significant positive correlation with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and lung injury severity, probably via ACE-2 down-regulation [32] . Elevated angiotensin-2 levels have also been seen with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and avian influenza pneumonia [47, 48] . ACE-2 levels decrease in old age and co-morbidities like hypertension and diabetes, possibly explaining worse lung injury and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 in them [45, 49] . In a phase-2 clinical trial of recombinant ACE-2 infusion in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), there was significant decrease in angiotensin-2 levels, and increase in Ang-(1-7) and surfactant protein-4 levels [50] . High levels of ACE-2 activity in children could be protective in children with COVID-19, leading to less severe disease in this age group compared to elderly.",
