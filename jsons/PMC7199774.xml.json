Alone the increasing infected numbers, the death rates (death person versus confirmed cases within selected area) seem to be less than 3% but much higher in new burst out countries. Most of the aged people are in dangerous status especially the one also has served medical history. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 may be found, but not all, in infected patients include fever (Infrared thermo-sensor can be used to detect high temperature persons), coughing, myalgia, fatigue, some with productive cough, headache, hemoptysis, and even diarrhea. Some patients will have severe pneumonia with difficulty in respiration (18% calculated from record in China).1 More recently, some patients were found to be with a disability to distinguish smell and/or tests (neurological disorder). So far, there is no effective way to distinguish healthy one from infected targets, even they do have some flu-like symptoms.",

Since no one knows who has already been infected and becomes infectious to others, they are at the same time freely to go out for their daily activities which, unfortunately, easily causes COVID-19 transmission. This situation causes a serious problem during the establishment of prevention network in every country. In Taiwan, to avoid the false-negative case, it requires at least three sequential negative tests of the SARS-CoV-2 before the case can be confirmed negative (combined with the positive or negative result to influenza virus). According to the Taiwan model, to quarantine any suspicious individuals for a period time according to the activities and contact history of the confirmed cases can efficiently slow down the transmission of COVID-19. However, it could profoundly disturb the daily life of a large population if related cases are confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. In general, for personal epidemic prevention of COVID-19, avoiding contact from hands, nose, and eyes and droplets is the primary task. How to foresee the SARS-CoV-2 infected targets and to just isolate selected population for advanced treatments while keeping others healthy (and free from quarantine) is one of the important goals during this global war against SARS-CoV-2.",

In Taiwan, such method is relatively mature since the breakout of SARS in 2003. However, it still takes around 4 hours to get the results, including 2 to 3 hours of reaction and around 1 hour of medical consultations and sampling. Moreover, to carefully confirm the infection, three regions of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences are selected for the assay: coding region for spike protein, ORF1, and ORF8. To shorten the reaction time, some company tried to develop new instruments and related kits for this purpose, for example, the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test (Cepheid), and AutoSAT with related kit, etc. These improvements may shorten the examination reaction within 1.5 hours.",

This method can be quickly developed for application by applying the specific mAb onto current commercially available test kit (such as replacing the anti-flu antibody with the specific mAb in flu test kit). Thus, a rapid diagnostic test kit for SARS-CoV-2 will be soon produced for large demands.

A specific exonuclease II (recognizing THF site) will be utilized to cut the double-strand status due to targeted RNA sensed the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 (such exo FRET probe is designed to be located within the targeted amplicon). Once this cut happens, it allows the restore of the FAM fluorescence since the quencher BHQ1 leaves.

However, the increased susceptive populations nearly exhaust the routine test procedure in many countries. Indeed, some of the new emerged approaches has potential for the future rapid diagnostics to release the heavy loading of rRT-PCR test, if their specificity and efficacy can be proved through clinical trial. For example, the antibody-based test developed by Academia Sinica has a great potential for fast exam since it can be adapted in the commercial flu-like test. The challenge will be the amplification of mAb, which is the rate-limit stage for large production of this kit. On the other hand, another novel method combining a modified RNA amplification technique with FRET quenching concept provide convincing results for future usage. Finally, in addition to the above example, the FRET-based strategy can also be applied to detect the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 receptor, or the activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease using specific peptide sequence as substrate between the FRET pair fluorescent proteins.",
