The infection is caused by a coronavirus of animal origin. In this epidemic, molecular detections of SARS coronavirus RNA were shown to be useful for the early diagnosis of SARS. Although this pathogen was eradicated in humans, SARS or SARS-like viruses might reemerge from animals or from laboratory incidents. In this chapter, we describe several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols for detecting SARS coronaviruses. These assays were routinely used for clinical diagnosis during the SARS outbreak.",

The disease is caused by a coronavirus originating from animals and the clinical presentations of the disease have been extensively reviewed (3) . Further studies also indicated that the virus is a distant relative of bat coronaviruses (4), suggesting bats might be natural carriers of the precursor of SARS coronavirus. However, the nature reservoir of SARS coronavirus is still not confirmed. As the majority of SARS patients seroconverted in the second week of disease onset, serological tests might not be a practical approach for early SARS diagnosis (3) . Because of these reasons, the focus of early diagnosis was mainly concentrated on the development of conventional and quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (3) . Besides, several molecular tests which employ non-PCR-based methods, such as loop mediated isothermal amplification (5) , rolling circle amplification (6) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (7) , were also developed for the detection of SARS coronavirus RNA.",

The protocols described in this chapter are directly adopted from our previous publications (8, 9) . The first and second assays are manual RT-PCR (Subheadings 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Subheading 3.5) assays, respectively, for SARS coronavirus detections (see Notes 1-3). As there is a possibility that other SARS-like coronaviruses found in bats or other mammals might have zoonotic potential, we also present another PCR assay which is able to detect groups 1 and 2 viruses (Subheading 3.6). This assay might be useful to screen the SARS-like patients whom are negative in the first two assays. It should be noted that the primer set used in the third assay can cross react with a wide range of coronaviruses. Therefore, the identities of all the positive PCR products from the third assay should be formally confirmed by DNA sequencing. In our experiences, this assay is able to detect other common human coronaviruses (e.g. HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E). 2. Equilibrate all reagents to room temperature before use.",
