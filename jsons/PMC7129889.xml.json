The first revolution largely affected ruminants and caused various livestock disease problems that were, especially in developed countries, controlled through creation of veterinary services, investment in research, and education systems.8 The benefits from these investments were felt in the control of several livestock diseases and in human health.14, 15 There were also advances in livestock production methods and marketing systems that helped to feed a growing urban population. However, this first revolution also created major zoonotic problems, such as bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, that were left unattended for decades. By the time they were controlled in livestock populations, these diseases had caused large-scale human morbidity and mortality.16, 17, 18\n",

It was facilitated by the availability of antimicrobial and antiparasitic treatments used for preventive purposes to allow high densities of animals to be kept under suboptimum husbandry conditions. Research into pig and poultry production systems has changed breeding, feeding, and management systems, leading to improvements in overall productivity and standardisation of products. These profound changes in livestock production have been broadly welcomed because they have met the growing demand for livestock products. Initially, there were some concerns about poor livestock producers being left behind,19, 20, 21, 22 and the potential negative effects on the environment.23, 24 What was less expected were the increased problems associated with control of animal diseases that cross international borders and the resurgence, and in some cases emergence, of zoonotic diseases. Additionally, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has led to demands to reduce or to avoid the use of antimicrobial preventive treatment in animal production.25\n",

Third, that a changing and increasingly interconnected world means changes in ecosystems that offer unpredictable opportunities to microbes that are more varied, numerous, and adaptable than we had once hoped, with spread occurring more rapidly. Experience in the past decade with, for example, Ebola, Nipah virus, avian influenza A H5N1, influenza A H1N1 2009, and SARS in 2002 are illustrative of new agents and zoonotic diseases associated with livestock or wild animals that are now burdening human public health systems on an international scale.",

            "text": "The framework that we propose draws on analysis of human and animal health systems during recent years. We illustrate this conceptual framework with case notes from three countries and three zoonoses to draw attention to different elements of the framework (Panel 1, Panel 2, Panel 3\n).Panel 1Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the CongoThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is subject to several emerging infectious diseases. One that results in substantial social disruption and high mortality is Ebola. The country has had five Ebola outbreaks since the first epidemic took place in Yambuku in 1976. The fourth and fifth outbreaks took place in Mweka in 2008 and 2009.The origins of the Ebola virus are difficult to establish, and prediction of where and when outbreaks are likely to occur is a challenge; therefore research into inputs might offer important strategic policy responses. Interventions to control outbreaks typically include early detection and rapid response including supportive clinical care and mass education. Research into specific pharmaceutical interventions is needed. Although the Mweka outbreak started in April, 2008, case confirmation did not occur until September, 2009. These health system delays, which were the result of inadequate mechanisms to deliver interventions, resulted in poor control for many months. 165 people died. Ineffective communication, poor stewardship, and insufficient resources contributed to delays in control. Research questions remain around which elements of the health system need to be strengthened to best support the management of such sporadic outbreaks, while the general health system is maintained and developed.Panel 2Rift Valley fever in TanzaniaRift Valley fever, an episodic vector-borne viral disease affecting domestic and wild animals as well as human beings, was first reported in Tanzania in 1956. The disease re-emerged in the country in 1977, and between December, 1997, and April, 1998, an epidemic occurred that is believed to have been caused by unusually large rainfall, the result of El Ni\u00e3o, and subsequent expansion of the mosquito vector population.A similar epidemic occurred in 2007. Is climate change an important input factor in the emergence of Rift Valley fever, and can interventions such as improved predictive surveillance linked to climate change or rainfall be harnessed to predict future epidemics? Although substantial delays occurred, in part because mechanisms to support interventions, including financing and logistics of laboratory testing of samples, control of the 2007 epidemic was largely the result of animal and human health agencies working in an integrated manner. Indeed, the outbreak was classified as a national disaster, thus falling under the authority of the National Disaster Preparedness and Response Unit, which involved several government departments and reported directly to the Prime Minister. Disease management units at local level were also established to support control measures across both human and animal populations. Questions remain about which elements of the health systems need to be integrated, and to what extent, to achieve policy goals that include human health protection and economic security, as well as ecological diversity. Furthermore, the response was in part dependent on a favourable and energised political context. Whether this factor is a prerequisite for effective control is unknown. Another question is how best to harness political support such that prevention through the targeted vaccination of at-risk livestock occurs before detection of clinical disease in animals or human beings.Panel 3Highly pathogenic avian influenza in CambodiaFrom 2003, the re-emergence of the influenza A H5N1 virus in poultry and sporadically in people has emphasised the need for a comprehensive public health response integrating elements of both animal and human sectors. Since 2004, Cambodia has had 21 poultry outbreaks resulting in nine human cases including seven deaths. Backyard poultry production is widespread throughout the country and accounts for more than 90% of the poultry population. Spread of H5N1 influenza overall is driven by trade links with Vietnam in the southern parts of the country, where there is a much higher density of poultry.Control of influenza A H5N1 is fairly well integrated across animal and human health systems at various levels, from surveillance to response coordination. For example, the Cambodian Communicable Disease Control Department hotlines can be accessed nationally and are often used by villagers to report poultry outbreaks. However, delays in reporting occur31, 32, 33 as a result of inadequate financial reimbursement for culled poultry, an intervention that has complex and ill-understood cultural as well as economic implications. Unlike neighbouring Vietnam, which has a similar domestic poultry economy, Cambodia has not adopted a poultry vaccination campaign. Contextual factors including the dominance of international donor agencies and concerns from the international community and Cambodia's neighbour, Thailand, which has a large export market, are important considerations that could be explored through policy analysis. Also, this disease response is driven by the perceived risk of an influenza pandemic and its associated costs to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, whereas it is ranked much lower among poultry smallholders in Cambodia. The short-term and long-term economic consequences of interventions, whether they be vaccination or culling, remain to be established. This information is likely to be important for evidence-based policy making.",
