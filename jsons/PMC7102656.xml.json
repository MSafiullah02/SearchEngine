Two previous epidemics caused by betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3], presaged the potential that another betacoronavirus was likely to cause a widespread pandemic [4]. By the time the first paper documenting this novel coronavirus infection was published on January 24, 2020, the infection had spread to over 800 patients, with evidence of person-to-person transmission [5] as well as international cases. Over the past few months, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has now become a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 cases globally. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, a paucity of data about the effects of this infection on patients with congenital heart disease. We aim to summarize the initial experience with COVID-19 and consider the potential applicability to and implications for patients with congenital heart disease.",

Furthermore, patients with underlying heart disease (both congenital or acquired) seem to have increased morbidity and mortality related to viral infections [9,10], and that is why there is a strong recommendation to vaccinate against influenza to prevent poor outcomes in them [11,12]. There is also some data to suggest that patients with underlying heart disease may be more susceptible to contracting coronavirus infection [13].",

The betacoronaviruses are able to infect human hosts through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [4,15,16] (Fig. 1\n). ACE2 is a membrane-bound protein that is expressed in many human cells, including vascular endothelia, renal tissue, cardiovascular tissue, and small intestine epithelia [16]. Based on studies investigating both SARS and MERS coronaviruses, it was shown back in 2015 that circulating bat coronaviruses have the potential for human emergence using human ACE2 as a receptor into host cells [4]. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that this novel betacoronavirus has a very similar receptor binding domain/motif to the SARS coronavirus [15], suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor to enter human cells. Recent genetic sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 shows an 80% similarity to SARS and a 50% similarity to MERS coronavirus, making SARS-CoV-2 the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans, as well as the third coronavirus with bat origins [17].",

The betacoronaviruses mainly infect epithelial cells in the lung [19], but SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in respiratory, fecal, and blood specimens of patients infected with the virus [14]. SARS-CoV-2 is spread through droplets, contact, and entry through ocular tissue [20]. Fecal shedding has been seen in up to 30% of patients for up to 4\u20135 weeks after onset of symptoms, but it is unclear if this correlates with infectivity. Since ACE2 is also expressed in intestinal epithelia and live virus has been detected in the stool of patients with COVID-19, transmission via the fecal-oral route is theoretically possible, but has not been confirmed in epidemiologic studies as of yet [20]. The virus can remain viable as an aerosol for up to 3 h and on certain surfaces for up to 72 h [21]. The virus can be detected 1\u20132 days prior to symptom onset in upper respiratory samples [20], and with a median incubation period estimate of 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5\u20135.8 days) [18,22], SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be mainly spread via asymptomatic carriers [23,24], which makes containment of the disease difficult. Substantial undocumented infections by asymptomatic but infected individuals may explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 [25].",

No direct damage to heart tissue was noted, but this was only in one patient. Data from multiple studies show that inflammatory markers are increased with SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from CRP, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, to TNF-\u03b1 [1,27,28], which has been posited to contribute to a sustained inflammatory response and cytokine storm (Fig. 1).

One study showed that a sizeable proportion (18%) of patients who are infected with COVID-19 may not exhibit any symptoms at all [24]. Most symptomatic patients with COVID-19 will present with fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. They will have findings of pneumonia on chest X-ray and computed tomography scans of the chest [31]. Most symptomatic patients suffer a mild respiratory infection requiring supportive care like supplemental oxygen. Patients can also develop gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea [32].

One study showed that patients infected with COVID-19 who had underlying hypertension had increased odds of death (OR 3.05 [95% CI 1.57\u20135.92, p < .001]) compared to those without hypertension. Similarly, coronary artery disease was associated with increased odds (OR 21.4 [95% CI 4.64\u201398.7, p < .0001]) of death [40]. In one meta-analysis, COVID-19 patients with hypertension had a relative risk ratio of 2.03 (95% CI 1.54\u20132.68, p < .00001) of having severe disease/requiring ICU care compared to those without hypertension. Patients with coronary artery disease/cerebrovascular disease had a relative risk ratio of 3.3 (95% CI 2.03\u20135.36, p < .00001) of having severe disease/requiring ICU care compared to those without cardiovascular disease [41]. When analyzing the largest case series to date (44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases), the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that patients with cardiovascular disease had a case fatality rate of 10.5% and those with hypertension had a case fatality rate of 6%, both of which were higher than the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% [39] (Fig. 2\n). Patients with hypertension accounted for 13% of the COVID-19 cases but they comprised 32% of the COVID-19 deaths. Patients with cardiovascular disease made up 4.2% of the COVID-19 cases, but were responsible for 18.3% of the COVID-19 deaths ([42], Fig. 2). This may be due to the fact that patients with history of coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes may have reduced or impaired cardiovascular functional reserve, and the COVID-19 infection may either precipitate a myocardial infarction (type 1 myocardial infarction), increase myocardial demand leading to worsening ischemia and necrosis (type 2 myocardial infarction), or increase metabolic demand that leads to heart failure and death [43].",

Proper isolation measures should be taken and providers should wear appropriate personal protective equipment, regardless of the diagnostic test. It should be noted that there are cases of negative initial testing that later repeated as positive, as this may be due to low viral titers early in the infection. One shocking reality is that in many countries, including Western nations like the United States, lack widespread testing capability. At the time of the writing of this manuscript in the third week of March 2020, testing in Los Angeles is woefully unavailable for the vast majority of potentially infected patients. Drive-through testing is not available for days and in-hospital testing is limited to the highest risk subsets.

Studies so far have not detailed in a granular fashion the risk of individual cardiovascular complications in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. While no studies on COVID-19 have included patients with congenital heart disease, it stands to reason that patients with congenital heart disease could be considered at higher risk for complications from COVID-19. Certain adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are likely at higher risk than others. Based on the ACHD Anatomy and Physiological Stage Classification, any patient with complex congenital heart disease (Anatomy Stage III) or Physiological Stage B, C, or D symptoms could be considered high risk for complications related to COVID-19 infection on the basis of decreased functional reserve [50] (Table 2\n). Those with reduced immunity, including Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome and asplenia may be at even higher risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19 infection. Studies have tried to risk-stratify patients suffering from a viral pneumonia [51], and the MuLBSTA score may be a tool providers can use to see which patients are at high risk of decompensation and death [31].",

This includes frequent handwashing, social distancing measures, proper and appropriate use of masks and other personal protective equipment, and cleaning and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces [52]. Patients with congenital heart disease should be vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia [11,12]. If possible, regularly scheduled clinic visits should be converted to telehealth visits to minimize risk of acquiring an infection in the nosocomial setting [53]. This desire to minimize risk of infection must obviously be weighed against the necessity of in-person visits for some patients, e.g. those with decompensated congestive heart failure or arrhythmias. The advent of wearable technology and wide availability of blood pressure, heart rate, and oximetry equipment for home use can be a reasonable substitute for in-clinic vital sign measurements. Additionally, the video function can allow a clinician to inspect the patient visually, albeit in a far less comprehensive manner when compared to the traditional physical examination. Hand-held and easily sterilized echocardiographic equipment can also be a \u2018handy\u2019 substitute for traditional comprehensive echocardiography, and the inevitably higher rate of exposure in a frequently visited echo lab. At least in the short term, these social distancing approaches to the practice of clinical medicine will have to suffice for the majority of our patients.

The initial data from the United States are similar, and estimates are that 20\u201330% of patients are being hospitalized [54]. For those that need to be admitted, the treatment is mainly supportive and should follow the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on management of COVID-19 [55].

Myocardial injury may occur due to a variety of mechanisms, from direct viral invasion of cardiomyocytes, hypoxia due to severe pneumonia leading to ischemic cardiac tissue, or an overwhelming inflammatory response leading to cytokine storm and myocardial dysfunction (Fig. 1) [41]. This leads to troponin leak and elevations in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). While laboratory assessment for cardiac injury is not recommended on a routine basis, patients who show signs and symptoms of myocardial injury (ST-segment changes on an electrocardiogram for example), acute coronary syndrome (chest pain), unstable arrhythmias, or heart failure should be evaluated thoroughly. Differentiation between normal cardiac function with increased metabolic demand, acute coronary syndrome, and fulminant myocarditis will be important as each of these clinical scenarios will require a different treatment algorithm. For patients who are deteriorating, judicious use of fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been successful at supporting patients through critical illness [29,55]. While the use of steroids has not been recommended in the general treatment of COVID-19 [55], there have been reports of patients recovering from fulminant myocarditis with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids [36]. More studies will be needed to help parse out which patients will benefit from such therapies.",

The only trial published so far assesses the use of lopinavir-ritonavir in adults hospitalized with COVID-19, and this therapy showed no benefit beyond standard of care [56]. Many of these therapies have cardiovascular side effects, however, and caution must be used when applying them to patients with congenital heart disease.

Each institution should develop protocols for appropriate triage, isolation, and treatment of COVID-19 patients who may need such interventions. In China, the preference has been to use thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute coronary syndromes (i.e. ST-elevation myocardial infarction) [57], but this has not been the standard of care in the United States. As the pandemic progresses and resources start to become strained, we may be asked to ration certain measures such as intensive care unit beds, mechanical ventilation and extra-corporeal support. It is our sincere hope that it will not come to this in the majority of countries. This concern further underscores the dire importance of slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to allow health care systems to appropriately prepare and manage this crisis without having to resort to rationing of the highest levels of care. Importantly, the clinical need for imaging, invasive and surgical interventions must be weighed against the risk of infecting healthcare workers who may lack the appropriate personal protective equipment at this point in time. Standard operating procedures for use of personal protective equipment and sterilization of catheterization labs and operating rooms should also be developed [53,58].",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses ACE2 as a receptor to enter and infect cells [15], and since ACE2 is expressed in many tissues including vascular endothelium and cardiac tissue [16], there have been some hypotheses that the use of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (ARBs) may have an effect on the course of COVID-19. ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II, and generates angiotensin 1\u20137, which is a potent vasodilator [59]. In animal models, the ARBs have been shown to increase cardiac ACE2 expression after chronic (>28 days) treatment [59]. Based on studies of the original SARS coronavirus, viral binding to ACE2 leads to ACE2 downregulation, which results in excessive production of angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and decreased quantities of the vasodilator heptapeptide angiotensin 1\u20137, which can contribute to lung injury and stimulation of the RAAS pathway. Counterintuitively, while ARBs increase the number of ACE2 receptors available for SARS-CoV-2 binding, the overall effect of ARBs may protect against lung injury by reducing angiotensin II production by ACE and by increasing the production of vasodilator angiotensin 1\u20137 [59]. The effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 is not yet known and remains unproven. More studies are required before any recommendations are made about starting or withdrawing ACE-inhibitor and ARB medications. As such, the Heart Failure Society of America, American College of Cardiology, and American Heart Association released a statement recommending continuation of RAAS inhibitors for patients currently taking them for \u201cindications for which these agents are known to be beneficial, such as heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease [60].\u201d This position has also been echoed by the European Society of Cardiology [61].",
