            "text": "Most coronaviruses in phylogenetic group 1 can cause disease in only one animal species. Within group 1, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and canine coronavirus (CCoV) use aminopeptidase N (APN) from their natural host for entry and infection of cells. [1] [2] [3] [4] APN is a highly conserved type II transmembrane glycoprotein in mammals (70-80% at the amino acid level). Remarkably, although each of these group 1 coronaviruses uses APN of its normal host for entry, all of them can also use feline APN (fAPN) as a receptor for entry and infection in cell culture. 2 Previous studies used chimeras between APN proteins of different species to identify domains in APN that are required for coronavirus receptor activity. [4] [5] [6] [7] Studies on receptor specificities of chimeras between human and feline APN or pig and human APN suggest that the spike glycoproteins of TGEV, FIPV, and HCoV-229E interact with two discontinous regions within APN. 6 Also, species-specific N-linked glycosylations in APN can affect receptor activity for HCoV-229E. 8 In in vivo studies, transgenic mice expressing human APN (hAPN) were resistant to infection with HCoV-229E, but cells harvested from the transgenic mice were susceptible to HCoV-229E. 9 hAPN transgenic mice in a Stat-1 knockout background (hAPN +/+ Stat -/-) were susceptible to HCoV-229E, which was adapted for growth in cells from these double transgenic mice. 10 These studies suggest that other host factors in addition to the receptor are needed for infection in vivo.",

Construct MF2 consisting of a smaller region of fAPN (amino acids 251-582) in a mAPN backbone functioned as a receptor only for HCoV-229E. The receptor activities of MF1 and MF3 indicated that amino acids 582 to 967 of fAPN were necessary and sufficient for entry of the cat, pig, and dog coronaviruses, but not for HCoV-229E. In contrast, amino acids closer to the N terminus of the protein (251-582aa) of fAPN were required for entry of HCoV-229E. Additional chimeras, MF 4, 5, and 6 were constructed to identify a smaller region in fAPN that would be sufficient for FIPV, TGEV, and CCoV entry. Importantly, MF6 identified a sequence of 127 amino acids in fAPN (aa 704-831) that when substituted into mAPN was sufficient for FIPV, TGEV, and CCoV receptor activity. These data agree with previously published conclusions based on other chimeric APN proteins. 4, 6, 7 Further mutational analysis identified several amino acid residues in aa ",

Without a crystal structure for APN, it is unclear whether these functionally important regions are adjacent in the three-dimensional structure of the receptor glycoprotein. These observed differences in fAPN receptor utilization correlate well with differences in the spike glycoproteins of these viruses, as the cat, pig, and dog virus spike glycoproteins are more closely related to each other at the amino acid level than to the HCoV-229E spike glycoprotein. Characterization of the molecular interactions between the spikes of these group 1 coronaviruses and their APN receptors will identify residues that affect the host ranges of these viruses and provide insight into the evolution of group 1 coronaviruses.",
