Twenty-three coronavirus strains have been recovered from the human respiratory t r a~t .~,~, * *~ Of these, 14 strains were isolated in tissue culture and appeared to be serologically similar or identical to the prototype strain 229E.'** The nine remaining strains were isolated in human embryonic tracheal organ culture.

The adults were employees of the National Institutes of Health with colds. The children were patients with croup, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia admitted to Children's Hospital, Washington, D.C.; the control pediatric group was made up of patients at the same hospital with nonrespiratory disease. Acute and convalescent serum samples were obtained at an interval of three weeks. The virus isolation procedures employed were those previously reported.14",

Appropriate control antigens were included in all tests. In the analyses that follow, serologic responses to strains OC38 and OC43 are grouped together. Moreover, because of frequent overlap between responses to OC38, OC43, and MHV (A-59) ,Is these three viruses are occasionally also considered as a group. the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In all age groups taken together, there was a significant negative correlation with LRTD (Xz = 7.4, p < 0.01). This negative correlation was particularly striking in the children over one year of age (Xz = 10.6, p < 0.01).",
