Currently, dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries in Africa, America, Asia and Oceania [9]. In Brazil, the first documented occurrence was in Roraima, 1981\u20131982, and the first huge epidemic was in Rio de Janeiro city, 1986 [17]. The largest outbreak in Brazil occurred in 2013, accounting for around 1.5 million of notified cases [13]. Dengue is transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti. The disease manifests in tropical and subtropical areas, which climatic conditions favor the development of eggs into larvae and mosquitoes. In Brazil circulate four strains of the virus, known as DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4 of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus [3].",

The study developed in [1] highlights the role of human movement for the disease\u2019s persistence by establishing a dynamic on a hypothetical network. The authors observed that the understanding of human mobility can be used to map risk areas and provide targets for intervention and prevention. Stoddard et al. [21] investigated the relevance of human movement associated with vector behavior and how these two factors can increase the risk of exposure to disease due to human movement.",

[18] that used the correlation between the occurrences of cases of dengue between cities in the state of Bahia to build a network of mobility [11, 14]. The authors considered that the existence of correlation between cases of dengue in two cities corresponds to an edge of the graph. It is possible to see through the graphs of incidence that there is a time lag between the epidemic curves, then we considered reasonable to verify the hypothesis of human mobility in the spread of the disease through the development of correlations.",
