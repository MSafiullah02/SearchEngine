Communicable diseases pose a threat to global health due to international connectivity, primarily through air travel [2], [3]. Respiratory, faeco-oral, vector-borne, zoonotic, blood-borne and sexual modes of disease transmissions have been identified previously in Mass gatherings [4]. Non-communicable risks, including stampedes, heat-related illness, accidents and terrorist attacks, also pose complex public challenges including crowd control, management of health services and public security [5]. In addition, rituals in religious events, such as rolling on the floor, or bathing naked in the river early in the morning, may predispose to skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary infections [6].",

In Hindu mythology, it is believed that the nectar of immortality was poured from a pitcher on four different places in India (Allahabad, Haridwar, Nasik and Ujjain), as a result of a long battle between the Gods and the Demons, which lasted 12 days and 12 nights. The Mela in its different forms alternates between these places. The Kumbh Mela happens once every 3 years in one of these locations on the banks of the corresponding rivers; Ganga in Haridwar, Godavari in Nasik, Kshipra in Ujjain and Sangam (confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers) in Allahabad (Fig. 1\n). The Ardh (half) Kumbh is held every 6 years in Haridwar and Allahabad. The Purna (full) Kumbh and the Maha Kumbh (great/supreme pitcher) are held every 12 years and every 144 years, respectively, only in Allahabad (9). The Sangam, a place where the rivers meet in Allahabad, is very auspicious according to Hindu mythology and people believe that one dip in the waters of the Sangam at a precise moment in time can wash away all of a person's sins [11]. The total number of auspicious days varies depending on the total duration of the festival. In 2013, the festival in Allahabad lasted for 55 days with six important bathing days attracting close to 100 million people [12] (FIG. 2, FIG. 3\n).",

The bathing ritual is the most important ritual and is started by a group of sadhus called naga sadhus who are considered spiritually and physically the most powerful of all. They are strong followers of Lord Shiva (the lord of destruction in Hinduism) and have given up all material possessions on this earth including family, wealth and clothes. They bath in ash and smear it over their body as a sign of divine protection and are naked except sometimes for a loin cloth.",

These were; fouling of river waters by the exceptionally large proportion of bathers to the quantity of water available, growth of the Vibrio cholerae assisted by the unusually hot weather at the site and increased virulence of the bacteria elsewhere in India. The last cholera epidemic in the Mela was reported in 1906 despite good sanitary arrangements. The reasons were attributed to drying up of the rivers and subsequent drinking of water from polluted beds, failure of patients to destroy soiled clothes and excreta of cholera patients and superstitious beliefs regarding drinking treated well water [20]. No epidemics have been reported since then, although there are studies cautioning about potential epidemics in the future [20], [21]. A study in 2003 reported encouraging results from the use of telemedicine during the Mela for evading cholera epidemics [22]. The surge in cases of diarrhoea during the fair was reported to a tertiary referral centre using a telemedicine service that uses electronic signals to transfer medical data from one site to the other. Vibrio cholerae was isolated in 7/31 cases (22.6%) and this information was communicated to the fair authorities. Following this, strict measures were taken to improve hygiene and the number of diarrhoea cases rapidly declined thereafter so averting a potential epidemic situation.",

The elderly population, over-crowding, exhaustion and other co-morbid conditions predispose the pilgrims to acquiring tuberculosis [25]. There have been a number of serogroup A meningococcal outbreaks in India affecting mainly the cities of northern India [26] and over-crowding during the Mela might provide a conducive environment for transmission of meningococci [27]. Other air-borne or droplet-borne infections also have the potential to spread during the Mela (like influenza, measles, chicken pox, pertussis and mumps). Most of these diseases are vaccine preventable and meticulous data collection will help decision making.",

The Harvard School of Public Health reported a 5% incidence of diarrhoeal diseases over a 23-day period during which they followed 30 000 patients in four sector hospitals. It is interesting to observe that there was a surge in non-bloody diarrhoea just 2 days after the bathing day that was on 29 January 2013. They also reported a peak in upper respiratory tract infections and cough, which coincided with the peak in non-bloody diarrhoeal disease during the 10-day observational period during the 2013 Mela [17]. They also reported that use of cow dung or firewood by pilgrims to light fires resulted in over 23% seeking medications for cough. Also, smoke from choolahs; a device used for cooking on fire created by wood or coal was the largest cause of respiratory illnesses among 15 000 patients who visited the various hospitals over 20 days [28].",
