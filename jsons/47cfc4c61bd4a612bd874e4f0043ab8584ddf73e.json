Since the turn of this century, international travel and migration, human encroachment and habitat expansion, and trade of live/dead animals have significantly increased (Travis et al. 2011) . Endemic and emerging tropic diseases have also followed suit. Over the last 20 years, the media has headlined emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and monkeypox, all of which originated from wild animals (Doyle 2015; Malone 2014; BBC News 2003). Table 12 .1 presents zoonotic diseases originated from wild animals, which have spread to humans through zoonosis. The microorganisms responsible for these diseases are not particularly heat resistant; therefore, thorough cooking is typically enough to destroy all of these. However, poor personal hygiene, cross-contamination during preparation, cuts, and exposed wounds are known routes that have allowed human infection. The handling and preparation of infected wildlife is therefore one of the critical transmission routes that must be carefully controlled. Table 12. 2 highlights examples of highly resistant diseases originated from wild animals, including those associated with bushmeat. The Bacillus anthracis spores, responsible for anthrax disease, are resistant to sterilization temperatures, drying, and many disinfectants. These spores can easily be spread by release in the air, which is why the US Military has viewed it as potential biological terrorism threat (Inglesby 1999; FDA 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 303, "end": 323, "text": "(Travis et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1658, "text": "(Inglesby 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1659, "end": 1668, "text": "FDA 2015)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 666, "end": 674, "text": "Table 12", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1237, "text": "Table 12.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Zoonotic Diseases"}, {"text": "Poisoning is widely used in many parts of Africa as a means of killing wild animals.

The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (2005) estimated that between 1 and 3.4 million tons are harvested annually from Africa alone. This includes approximately 28 million bay duiker antelopes (Cephalophus dorsalis) and over 7 million red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius). Meat, milk, and their products are banned from entering the European Union (EU) from non-EU countries, even if imported in small quantities for personal consumption (EC regulation 745/2004). There are certain exceptions to this; however, with countries endemic with diseases such as foot and mouth disease (FMD) including Africa, the Middle East, and parts of South America (FAO 2012), the law is strict.

Of this, a third is estimated as being protected under CITES (FDHA 2014).
