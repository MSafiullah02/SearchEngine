It has been shown that internalization of TfR requires Eps15, an endocytic protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. When EGFP-3a was misexpressed in an Eps15 mutant background [22], a dominant suppression of the EGFP-3a-induced rough eye phenotype was observed (Fig. 2\nC). Nedd4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is able to monoubiquitinate Eps15 for its endocytic function [23]. We further found that a P-element insertion (Nedd4\nEY00500) in the Nedd4 gene also dominantly suppressed the EGFP-3a-induced rough eye phenotype (Fig. 2D). Our data support previous findings that 3a is involved in protein trafficking [15], and our results highlight the involvement of clathrin-dependent endocytosis in 3a function.",

We therefore investigated whether the 3a-induced rough eye phenotype (Fig. 1B and supplementary Fig. 2B) was related to apoptotic cell death in flies. We performed acridine orange (AO) staining in third instar larval eye imaginal discs (Figs. 3\nG\u2013M) and observed increased numbers of AO-positive apoptotic cells in EGFP-3a-expressing eye discs (Fig. 3J). Consistently, eye discs misexpressed with the non-tagged 3a also showed increased numbers of AO-positive cells (supplementary Fig. 2F). When EGFP-3a was coexpressed with anti-apoptotic genes such as the caspase inhibitor P35, and the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (DIAP1), the rough eye phenotype was mostly suppressed (Figs. 3E and F). In addition, the number of AO-positive cells was also largely reduced when P35 or DIAP1 was coexpressed with EGFP-3a (Figs. 3K and L). Our data therefore confirmed that the SARS-CoV 3a gene is pro-apoptotic and its action can be counteracted by anti-apoptotic factors.",

Based on overlapping chromosomal deletions, 24 genomic regions were isolated (see experimental procedures). By crossing all mutant lines available at the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center that fall into these 24 modifying genomic regions to EGFP-3a flies, 78 individual genes (represented by 99 mutant lines) showed reproducible modification of the EGFP-3a-induced rough eye phenotype. Forty-six of these modifier genes (\u223c59%) have human orthologues and are also expressed in the human lung (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unigene). Based on their cellular functions, most of the EGFP-3a modifiers were classified into 5 categories including electron transport, gene transcription, protein posttranslational modification, calcium-binding, and nucleic acid-binding. Nineteen modifying loci are discussed here (Table 1\n).",

In Drosophila, there are 2 cytochrome c genes (dc3 and dc4) and they are both located at the 36A10-B3 region (Fig. 4E). A deletion line Df(2L)Exel6039, which uncovers this region, dominantly enhanced the EGFP-3a-induced rough eye phenotype (Fig. 4C). We further showed that cytochrome c protein levels were significantly reduced in this deletion line (Fig. 4F). Conversely, overexpression of the endogenous dc3 gene (Figs. 4G and H), by means of an EP insert line dc3\nEP2305, dominantly suppressed the EGFP-3a phenotype (Fig. 4D). Our data therefore suggest that the severity of the EGFP-3a-induced rough eye phenotype correlates with cellular cytochrome c levels. In support of this, a reduction in the number of AO-positive cells was observed when EGFP-3a was coexpressed with dc3\nEP2305 (Fig. 3M). Further, we showed that EGFP-3a overexpression did not affect mRNA expression levels of both dc3 and dc4 genes (Fig. 4G).",

            "text": "The YXX\u03a6 tetra-peptide motif is essential for the rapid internalization of proteins from the plasma membrane [13]. The 3a protein possesses such conserved YXX\u03a6 motif (160\u2013163 a.a.) and has been shown to be able to mediate specific internalization of 3a-specific IgG molecules to the cell interior from the culture medium [3]. Therefore, 3a has therefore been suggested to play some roles in protein trafficking in viral-infected cells [3], [15]. Here, we provided genetic evidence to support a trafficking role of 3a and further linked it to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 2). Eps15 has been shown to play an important role in the endocytosis of TfR, a cellular YXX\u03a6-containing protein [33]. Nedd4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and has also been implicated in endocytosis and virus budding [34]. Nedd4 is able to monoubiquitinate Eps15 for its endocytic function [23]. We showed that mutant alleles of both Eps15 and Nedd4 dominantly suppressed the EGFP-3a phenotype (Fig. 2). Our data therefore support that 3a is functionally related to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Given the physical interaction between 3a and other viral proteins (the S protein in particular, [6]), our results underscore the role of 3a in the intracellular trafficking of SARS-CoV proteins during the viral life cycle. In humans, both Eps15 and Nedd4 are expressed in the human lung (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unigene). This further highlights the functional relevance of these proteins to SARS-CoV pathogenesis.",

Since cytochrome c is a potent 3a modifier (Fig. 3), our data would suggest that 3a induces apoptosis through the mitochondria. Suppression of the EGFP-3a phenotype was observed when cytochrome c was overexpressed (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, we could only detect the overexpressed cytochrome c protein in the dc3\nEP2305 line with antibodies that recognize the denatured, but not native, cytochrome c proteins (Fig. 4H). This indicates that the overexpressed cytochrome c protein was not in its native conformation. It has previously been reported that overexpression of the non-native apocytochrome c (cytochrome c protein without the heme group) can block apoptosis in mammalian cells [38]. We therefore reasoned that the dc3\nEP2305 dominant suppression of the EGFP-3a phenotype is the result of the inhibition of apoptosis. Consistent with this view, we also observed reduced numbers of AO-positive apoptotic cells when EGFP-3a was coexpressed with dc3\nEP2305 (Fig. 3M).",

Similar to CtBP, we showed that two other transcriptional regulators Su(H) and emc also dominantly suppressed the EGFP-3a phenotype (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) Further, CtBP has been shown to repress transcription of an emc orthologue, Id1, in mammalian cells [31]. It is therefore expected that the reduction of CtBP activity would lead to de-repression of emc. Consistent with this view, we observed suppression of the EGFP-3a phenotype when emc was overexpressed (Fig. 6C). We also observed that several EP lines (including EP3620 and EP0415) that have been mapped upstream of the emc ORF were capable of suppressing the EGFP-3a-induced rough eye phenotype (data not shown).",

Since emc is a transcriptional regulator, down-regulation of its expression would in turn affect the expression of downstream emc-responsive genes. It has also recently been shown that 3a altered gene expression in cultured cells [39]. Interestingly, transcriptional alteration of some of the 3a modifiers identified in our study (e.g., DIAP1 and emc) has also been detected in SARS-CoV-infected cells [36], [40]. However, we found that 3a does not affect gene expression level of all 3a modifiers. For example, we did not detect any alteration of dc3 mRNA expression in EGFP-3a flies (Fig. 4G). This would suggest that 3a is a multi-functional protein which affects multiple cellular processes.",

To investigate the intracellular roles of 3a, we performed a genetic screen to isolate dominant 3a modifier genes. Our data indicate that 3a interacts genetically with multiple cellular machineries (Table 1). We further highlighted that 3a is functionally related to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 2) and its misexpression causes apoptosis (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Besides, 3a also interacts genetically with various transcriptional regulators (Fig. 5) and it alters cellular transcription activity (Fig. 6). This is the first example illustrating the use of transgenic fly models to investigate the functional roles of 3a and other SARS-CoV viral gene products in vivo.",
