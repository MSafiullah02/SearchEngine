The pathophysiological mechanism of sepsis is highly complex, and the mortality of in-patients suffering from sepsis is more than 10%. Severe unmanaged inflammation and inappropriate immune response characterize sepsis. Anti-inflammation therapies alone are not successful for the reason that disbalance of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving agents. In the recent researches, the host responses during the course of self-resolving infections are found to have the involvements of specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs), namely, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins. These endogenous lipid metabolites are core signal molecules in the resolution of inflammation, playing a key role in regulating the inflammation and promoting return to homeostasis. Besides, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, a sensitive marker for oxidative stress) is also known for upregulation in inflammation profiling. Carbon monoxide, synthesized by HO-1, performs multiple stances of anti-inflammation and pro-resolution along with the SPMs. If the potentially beneficial effects of these mediators would be well evaluated in clinical trials, they present encouraging new hints in managing infectious maladies especially sepsis.",

Data showed that the cost of medical care for sepsis patients was more than $20 billion (5.2%) of total US hospital costs in 2011 [2] . Although the accurate incidence of sepsis is unknown, the reported data are increasing [3, 4] , and conservative estimates indicate that sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in the US hospitals and critical illness in the world [5, 6] .",

Recently, it is recognized that the initiation and cessation of immune and inflammatory responses is an initiative and symphony process. The pathogenesis of sepsis is intricate. The early stages of sepsis are characterized by excessive generation of inflammatory mediators; however, as sepsis develops into severe chronic sepsis, immunosuppression dominates. This demonstrates that excessive uncontrolled inflammation and inappropriate immune response characterize sepsis [7] . The new lights into sepsis contribute to the explanation of failure in current treatment strategies, including inhibition of the activation phase of the acute inflammatory response to infection (e.g. glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-TNF-\u03b1 drugs) [8] . Therefore, it's urgent and beneficial to explore new paradigms in managing sepsis.",

            "text": "Lipoxins (trihydroxy-tetraene-containing eicosanoids) are derived from the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) through sequential reactions involving lipoxygenase enzymes, including 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) and 15-lipoxygenase type 1 (15-LOX-1). There are two series of lipoxins, lipoxin-A4 (LXA4) and lipoxin-B4 (LXB4) [17] . We mainly summarize the activities of LXA4 in this chapter. Lipoxins exert effects through a G-protein-coupled receptor, formyl peptide receptor-2 (FPR2/ALX). This receptor mainly expresses on the membrane of cells in the immune system along with the resident fibroblasts and epithelial cells [18] . In general, lipoxins are potent inhibitors of inflammatory activity, inducing the resolution of leukocyte activity. They block the response to leukotrienes and chemotactic factors such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and platelet-activating factor [19] . These effects inhibit the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells. The resolution of inflammation involves reduction of neutrophil recruitment, promotion of macrophage migration and augmentation of apoptotic cells efferocytosis. Lipoxins exert immune-modulatory activity as well [17, 18] .",

Later, the treatment of receptor antagonists and inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase in early sepsis (1 h postinfection) even increased leukocyte migration to the infected tissues, and survival rate increased. On the contrary, receptor agonist and LXA4 application consequently worsened early infection and reduced migration of leukocytes. But, 24 h postinfection, LXA4 improved animal survival.

These RvTs mediators include RvT1, RvT2, RvT3 and RvT4, which are derived from n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (n-3 DPA) through sequential reactions involving COX-2/5-LOX in the crosstalk of vascular endothelia and neutrophils. Each of these molecules activates the host immunity in a dose-dependent manner for bacterial clearance and counter-regulates the production of pro-inflammatory molecules including endothelin-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and inflammatory eicosanoids. Moreover, concentrations of RvTs in peripheral blood increased rapidly after exercise (a self-resolving inflammatory state) in healthy volunteers and were significantly higher in patients with sepsis than in healthy subjects. These results indicate that RvTs biosynthesis occurs in a coordinated manner in correlation with acute activation of the immune response. Therefore, inability to form these pathways leads to delayed resolution responses and an impaired ability to clear bacterial infections [71] .",

PCTRs are derived from DHA through 15-LOX-mediated pathways in leukocytes. Since PCTRs actively promote the termination of bacterial infections by stimulating the uptake and killing the bacteria as well as the repair and regeneration of damaged tissues, these mediators are immunoresolvents [73] .

Endogenously formed CO acts as a signalling molecule and induces antioxidant genes [76, 77] . CO downregulates inflammatory prostaglandins and thromboxanes. On the other hand, it enhances the expression of lipoxygenases which are key synthetases of SPMs [15] . Resolvins and lipoxins in turn upregulate HO-1 in macrophages demonstrating mutual amplification of these two proresolving pathways [15] . CO contributes to active pathways on the elimination of microorganisms, promote killing of bacteria and enhance their clearance by macrophages in a protective manner [78] .

In Annexin A1-null mice models of inflammation, treating with anti-Annexin A1 antibodies or antisense constructs of Annexin A1, have confirmed that Annexin A1 exhibits as an endogenous regulator of antiinflammatory and pro-resolving as well as a mediator of GC action [89, 90] . Annexin A1, binding to FPR in the innate immune system, exerts general suppressive activities including the reduction of the amounts of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids molecules generated and the release of histamine and preformed cytokines from mast cells. In contrast, ANX-A1 may induce the release of pro-resolving mediators, such as IL-10. Furthermore, Annexin A1 highly downregulates PMN migration into inflammatory sites and accelerates their apoptosis, while the migration of monocytes into inflammatory sites is promoted by Annexin A1 which eventually transform the microenvironment into a resolving procedure [92] . In an in vivo experiment, the absence of Annexin A1 or its major receptor (FPR2) amplifies greatly the duration and intensity of acute and chronic inflammation. Consequently, the acute antiinflammatory actions of GCs are greatly reduced or even abrogated. Conversely, human recombinant Annexin A1 and peptides derived from the N-terminal domain can rescue this phenotype and exert high anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution effects in many models of inflammation [90, 92] .",

Despite of inspiring results in preclinical models, none of the presumptive therapeutic agents tested so far succeed in clinical trials. Excessive uncontrolled inflammation and inappropriate immune responses are both characteristic features of sepsis that complicate identification of suitable drug targets. Inhibition of inflammation may delay the resolution because of an improper induction of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving pathways. Overcoming sepsis, there is still a long way to run. An accumulating evidence decodes the role that endogenous resolutions triggered by SPMs demonstrate the ensured internal homeostasis in host body by activating the ultimate cardinal signs of resolution that include pathogen and cellular debris lavage, analgesia and restoration of organ functions. Latest studies point out that monitoring the concentrations of these SPMs in infected patients may provide a better understanding of the inflammation-resolution procedures and hence reflect a positive outcome [48] . Yet, requiring further prospective studies to confirm these observations. The points and the hints that are mentioned in this review indicate that SPMs act as potential biomarkers and, more importantly, hold a great promise as novel therapeutics in inflammatory diseases. Latest studies reveal that the majority of end-stage fatal sepsis patients are immunosuppressed rather than hyperinflammation [93] . Given, the potential anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution benefits of these SPMs (including CO, HO-1 and Annexin A1) mentioned above, endogenous or exogenous supplement of these mediators analogues or natural extracts may be a new paradigm in treating sepsis.",
