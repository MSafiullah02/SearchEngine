This not only makes our daily life more convenient, but also has made us vulnerable to new types of diffusion risks. These diffusion risks arise in many different contexts. For instance, infectious diseases, such as SARS [123], H1N1 [62] or Ebola [168], have spread geographically and killed hundreds of thousands or even millions of people. Computer viruses, like Cryptolocker and Alureon, cause a good share of cyber-security incidents [119]. In the real world, rumors often emerge from multiple sources and spread incredibly fast in complex networks [62, 123, 142, 168]. After the initial outbreak of rumor diffusion, the following three issues often attract people\u2019s attention: (1) How many sources are there? (2) Where did the diffusion emerge? and (3) When did the diffusion breakout?",

            "text": "In the past few years, researchers have proposed a series of methods to identify rumor diffusion sources in networks. These methods mainly focus on the identification of a single diffusion source in networks. For example, Shah and Zaman [160] proposed a rumor-center method to identify rumor sources in networks under complete observations. Essentially, they consider the rumor source as the node that has the maximum number of distinct propagation paths to all the infected nodes. Zhu and Ying [203] proposed a Jordan-center method, which utilizes a sample path based approach, to detect diffusion sources in tree networks with snapshot observations. Luo et al. [115] derived the Jordan-center method based on a different approach. Shah and Zaman [161] proved that, even in tree networks, the rumor source identification problem is a #P-complete problem, which is at least as hard as the corresponding NP problem. The problem becomes even harder for generic networks. However, due to the extreme complexity of the spatiotemporal rumor propagation process and the underlying network structure, few of existing methods are proposed for identifying multiple diffusion sources. Luo et al. [114] proposed a multi-rumor-center method to identify multiple rumor sources in tree-structured networks. The computational complexity of this method is O(n\nk), where n is the number of infected nodes and k is the number of sources. It is too computationally expensive to be applied in large-scale networks with multiple diffusion sources. Chen et al. [32] extended the Jordan-center method from single source detection to the identification of multiple sources in tree networks. However, the topologies of real-world networks are far more complex than trees. Fioriti et al. [58] introduced a dynamic age method to identify multiple diffusion sources in general networks. They claimed that the \u2018oldest\u2019 nodes, which were associated to those with largest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix, were the sources of the diffusion. Similar work to this technique can be found in [148]. However, an essential prerequisite is that we need to know the number of sources in advance.",

            "text": "In this chapter, we introduce a novel method, K-center, to identify multiple rumor sources in general networks. In the real world, the rumor diffusion processes in networks are spatiotemporally complex because of the combined multi-scale nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the networks. To have a clear understanding of the complex diffusion processes, we adopt a measure, effective distance, recently proposed by Brockmann and Helbing [24]. The concept of effective distance reflects the idea that a small propagation probability between neighboring nodes is effectively equivalent to a large distance between them, and vice versa. By using effective distance, the complex spatiotemporal diffusion processes can be reduced to homogeneous wave propagation patterns [24]. Moreover, the relative arrival time of diffusion arriving at a node is independent of diffusion parameters but linear with the effective distance between the source and the node of interest. For multi-source diffusion, we obtain the same linear correlation between the relative arrival time and the effective distance of any infected node. Thereby, supposing that any node can be infected very quickly, an arbitrary node is more likely to be infected by its closest source in terms of effective distance. Therefore, to identify multiple diffusion sources, we need to partition the infection graph so as to minimize the sum of effective distances between any infected node and the corresponding partition center. The final partition centers are viewed as diffusion sources.",

Figure 11.2a shows an example of an infection graph with diffusion source S. The colors indicate the infection order of nodes (e.g., nodes A, C, D and F were infected after the first time tick T = 1, similarly for the other nodes). Notice that the diffusion process is spatiotemporally complex, because the first-order neighbors of source S can be infected after the second time tick (e.g., node E) or even the third time tick (e.g., node B), similarly for the second-order and third-order neighbors. We then alter the infection graph by replacing the weight on each edge with the effective distance between the corresponding end nodes (see Fig. 11.2b). We notice that the effective distances from source S to all the infected nodes can accurately reflect the infection order of them. This exactly shows that the relative arrival time of an arbitrary node getting infected is linear with the effective distance between the source and the node of interest.",

We notice that the rationale of the K-center method is similar to that of the K-means algorithm in the data-mining field. Similar to the K-means algorithm, there is no guarantee that a global minimum in the objective function will be reached. From Theorem 11.2, We see that the computational complexity of the K-center method is much less than the method in [115] with O(n\nk), and much less than the method in [58] with O(n\n3). In addition, the proposed method can be applied in general networks, whereas the other methods mainly focus on trees. Comparatively, the proposed method is more efficient and practical in identifying multiple diffusion sources in large networks.",

We used effective distance to transform the original network in order to have a clear understanding of the complex diffusion pattern. Based on the altered network, we derive a succinct formulation for the problem of identifying multiple rumor sources. Then we proposed a novel method that can detect the positions of the multiple rumor sources, estimate the number of sources, and predict the spreading time of the diffusion. Experiment results in various real network topologies show the outperformance of the proposed method than other competing methods, which justify the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",

In this chapter, we have adopted the SI model with the knowledge of which nodes are infected and their connections. There are also some other models, such as the SIS and SIR. These models may conceal the infection history of the nodes that have been recovered. Therefore, the proposed method requiring a complete observation of network will not work in the SIS or SIR model. According to our study, we may need other techniques, e.g., the network completion, to cope with the SIS and SIR models. Future research includes the use of different models. Moreover, in the real world, we may only obtain partial observations of a network. Thus, future work includes multi-source identification with partial observations. We may also need to take community structures into account to more accurately identify multiple diffusion sources.",
