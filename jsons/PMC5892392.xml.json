In late 2015, Dobrynin et al. (2015) released the whole genome sequence assembly and annotation of 7 cheetahs including the reference genome of \u201cChewbacca,\u201d the ambassador cheetah for the Cheetah Conservation Fund (see below). The initial genome analyses unraveled a plethora of fascinating insights around the cheetah\u2019s past and also its remarkable specialization for dazzling speed. Multiple features of the cheetah\u2019s genome were detailed and annotated in depth: 20343 protein-coding genes, the wide complexity of repetitive DNA families, noncoding RNA families, DNA variation within and outside of genes, copy number variation, and genes that showed evidence of recent selective pressures. The cheetah\u2019s incredible specialization for running is likely influenced by selective retention of gene variants related to energetics and anabolism for producing muscle specialization. The genome analyses identified a group of 11 candidate genes that display evidence of selection involved in muscle contraction (5 genes), stress response (2 genes), and regulation of catabolic processes (4 genes), all now putative candidates for the cascade of sprinting adaptations we see in modern cheetahs.",

Further mining of Chewbacca\u2019s genome revealed a plausible explanation for the cheetahs\u2019 ability to accept allogeneic skin grafts. Several genes that mediate graft rejection, the MHC (perhaps the most variable gene family in human and other mammal genomes) are nearly monomorphic across different cheetahs. In addition, all cheetahs have actually disarmed 4 MHC genes entirely (Dobrynin et al. 2015).",

One marked consequence of these bottlenecks and subsequent consanguineous matings is reproductive impairments including elevated incidence of malformed spermatozoa (O\u2019Brien et al. 1983; Wildt et al. 1993; Crosier et al. 2007). The cheetah genome analyses revealed that AKAP4, a testis-expressed gene known to regulate sperm development in humans and mice, showed a remarkable signatures of selection due to 10 fixed substitutions in coding regions, 5 of which are function altering and likely compromise normal sperm development in the entire species (Dobrynin et al. 2015). This evolutionary gene alteration becomes a strong candidate to explain the spermatazoal abnormalities that were discovered in all cheetahs studied decades ago.",

The Asian cheetah was eliminated by sport hunting and exploitation in India before the 1940s, the only large mammal to go extinct in India in the past 1000 years. Spearheaded by noted Indian cheetah conservationists M. K. Ranjitsinh and Divyabhanusinh Chavda, a workshop to plan and facilitate the reintroduction of cheetah to suitable habitats of their former range in India nature reserves was convened in 2010 at Gajner, Rajasthan, a game reserve where the last Indian cheetah had survived. The workshop was attended by Indian conservation managers and scientists, by Nature Reserve superintendents and by cheetah researchers (Ranjitsinh and Jhala 2010).",

If Indian conservationists could identify regions/reserves with suitable habitat with adequate prey, from where should the translocated cheetah come? Conventional ecological wisdom says that one should strive to identify a stable population of animals that could be removed without harming the parent populations. Ideally the introduced animals should be genetically close to the original lost population so that any adaptations accumulated by the target (Indian cheetah) population over time would be retained. The obvious choice under these conditions would be the Iranian cheetah, the single living Asian cheetah population, a relict population of less than 50 animals clinging to survival in Iran since the overthrow of the Shah in 1960s (Farhadinia et al. 2016; Durant et al. 2017). However, the Iranian animals are not ideal candidates due to their endangered status, their precarious health, their present isolation into multiple small subpopulations and their political sensitive locale. So what to do?",

These substitutional distances allow for estimation of the time separations as between 4400 and 6100 years among any African population or between African and the Asian-Iranian specimens (Table 1).

Thus, we tentatively can conclude that the cheetahs in Iran did descend from the same historic bottleneck event which homogenized the African cheetah population ~10\u201312000 years ago. As such, in genetic terms, Iranian migrants (as a re-introduction source) would be no closer or \u201cbetter adapted\u201d than any African population to be considered for restoration to India. We presented these data and conclusions at the Gajner, Rajasthan restoration workshop in 2010. The workshop report noted that African cheetahs should be acceptable source for the Indian habitat restoration. The balance of the workshop business and proceedings concentrated on identifying suitable habitat and prey base among potential restoration site in Indian Nature reserves (Ranjitsinh and Jhala 2010).

This study included more individuals but shorter sequence and fewer informative sites (139 bp of control region for all, and 915 base pairs for some, with 12\u201314 parsimony informative sites) than our study. They also presented an analyses of 20 microsatellite loci for 92 cheetah specimens. Results of their phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA were in effect remarkably similar to ours. Their mtDNA analyses demonstrated monophyly of cheetahs from Asia, South Africa, and Somalia as well as differentiation of these populations using microsatellite genotypes. Southern and northeast African cheetah populations showed modest molecular genetic distances in comparison with Iranian cheetahs, similar to the distances among African population isolates. Their results affirm the distinction of Asian to African cheetah populations but also their shallow divergence, lending additional support to the interpretation that like African populations, Asiatic cheetahs derive from a post-bottleneck expansion. Charruau et al. (2011) also presented data on a museum specimen of extinct Indian cheetah showing it to align rather closely with the Iranian cheetah lineage. This result supports other evidence of a common Asian origin for Indian and Iranian cheetahs and discounts a previously unsettled postulate that the Iranian cheetahs are possibly descendants of African cheetahs that were re-located and released by Middle Eastern sheiks in historic times.",

The explanation seems that they employed multiple genetic models, which led to conflicting results. This seems due in part to the imprecision of microsatellite mutation rates estimates, which vary over 4 logs, and the short length mtDNA sequence (only 139 bp of control region). Nonetheless the new data from Charruau et al. (2011) are clearly consistent with our own previous findings and interpretations (Figure 2).

Since 2010 there have been legal assaults on the restoration program for numerous reasons. In 2012, India\u2019s Supreme Court suspended the proposed restoration based upon the ambiguous and imprecise dating calculations presented by Charruau et al. (2011). [A similar political stall occurred in the early 1990s with the Florida panther/puma recommendation for restoration. That ended happily with success for the 1996 puma restoration efforts (Johnson et al. 2010).]",

Conservationists of all disciplines claim to want the same thing\u2014species preservation and stabilization of natural ecosystems. Should new generations of wildlife managers look at all the data from different fields including genetics, they are better equipped to make informed management decisions, often having to make the best of some very bad situations.
