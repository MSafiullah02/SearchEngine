Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002.6 In addition to its public health implications, rhinosinusitis has a considerable economic impact. The most recent estimates suggest that expenditures attributable to ABRS total approximately $3.5 billion each year in the United States.7 In 2002, approximately $400 to $600 million was spent on antibiotic prescriptions for acute sinusitis.6, 8\n",

As a result, clinicians often overtreat uncomplicated rhinosinusitis by readily prescribing antibiotics for the majority of patients with signs and symptoms of VRS (eg, headache, facial pain, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, fever). Recent reports in the medical literature suggest that primary care physicians prescribe antibiotics for up to 85% to 98% of patients with clinically suspected rhinosinusitis.9, 10 The practice of treating uncomplicated VRS with antibiotics has two fundamental limitations: first, secondary bacterial infection complicates a relatively small proportion of cases and second, excessive antibiotic use is associated with consequences, both to individuals and to society as a whole.",

Viruses also have a substantial suppressive effect on neutrophil, macrophage and lymphocyte function. Effects on neutrophil function include diminished adherent, chemotactic, phagocytic, oxidative, secretory, and bactericidal functions. Viruses also suppress macrophage and lymphocyte function, resulting in patients with viral URIs being generally more vulnerable to secondary overgrowth and subsequent bacterial infection by pathogens residing in the nasopharynx, such as S pneumoniae and H influenzae. An animal model of nontypeable H influenzae adherence to respiratory epithelium was studied in the cotton rat with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.24 Colonization with nontypeable H influenzae increased to a maximum within 4 days of RSV infection compared to RSV negative controls and then declined over the subsequent 10 days. Systemic immunity to nontypeable H influenzae as measured by IgG-specific antibody to the outer membrane complex and bactericidal antibody did not influence colonization. These data suggest that colonization with nontypeable H influenzae is significantly affected by a concurrent infection with RSV24; however, the site of bacterial attachment is not known. The mechanism of attachment involves upregulation of expression of epithelial cell surface receptors including CEACAM1, ICAM-1, and PAF-r.25\n",

After 2 weeks without antibiotic therapy, repeat CT scans in 14 subjects revealed that 79% showed either disappearance or marked improvement in the previously identified abnormalities. The point at which a viral URI becomes superinfected with pathogenic bacteria may be determined with repeated sinus aspiration studies. Sinus aspiration studies in adults demonstrate significant bacterial growth in approximately 60% of patients with URI symptoms for 10 days or more.36 While duration of symptoms beyond 7 days is a moderately sensitive predictor of ABRS, it is relatively nonspecific because duration of symptoms does not reliably distinguish prolonged viral infection from ABRS.37 Individual cases may fall out of the \u201cnorm\u201d of this typical progression and have specific findings suggesting bacterial infection (fever, facial erythema and swelling, and severe pain); therefore, clinicians need to rely on clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with a viral URI that has not resolved after 10 days or worsens after 5 to 7 days and is accompanied by some or all of the following signs or symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness (Table 1).\n",

            "text": "Physical examination provides limited information in the diagnosis of ABRS. Several studies have evaluated whether certain signs or symptoms are specific to bacterial infection; however, these studies have methodologic limitations in that sinus aspiration was not used to document the presence or absence of bacterial infection.37 Unlike acute otitis media, in which the tympanic membrane and middle ear space are readily available for direct examination, the paranasal sinuses are hidden within the skull. Anterior rhinoscopy, with or without topical decongestant, allows examination of the mucosa of the inferior turbinate, secretions within the anterior nose, and the orientation of the nasal septum. Fiberoptic endoscopy allows visualization of the middle meatus, and direct culture of purulence in this region may correlate with cultures from maxillary sinus aspirates.38, 39 In a recent review of the literature, Benninger et al40 reported that there is 60% to 85% concordance between culture material obtained from endoscopically guided middle meatal swabs and maxillary sinus puncture. These studies, however, are limited by small sample sizes, and are therefore inadequate to make recommendations regarding the role of endoscopically guided middle meatal cultures as a formal method of identifying pathogens in ABRS at this time. A prospective study is currently underway to better answer this question. Other diagnostic modalities include transillumination, ultrasound, and radiological imaging. Transillumination has a 60% and 90% reproducibility rate for assessing disease within the maxillary sinuses and the frontal sinuses, respectively, but this does not differentiate bacterial from viral infection.41 B-mode ultrasound has replaced A-mode ultrasound for the diagnosis of diseases within the paranasal sinuses. However, because only the maxillary sinus can be adequately assessed, B-mode ultrasound has limited utility. A study correlating CT scan and B-mode ultrasound findings demonstrated a sensitivity of roughly 73% for the maxillary sinuses, 23% for the frontal sinuses and 11% for the ethmoids.42 Compared with clinical evaluation, the sensitivity of B-mode ultrasound was 36% and the specificity was 90%.43 Because ultrasound is technique-sensitive, there may be marked variations in the reliability of the information provided.44 Ultrasound cannot distinguish between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis.",

CT scans clearly detect abnormalities within the sinuses; however, as previously noted, abnormalities are frequently found on CT scans of patients with viral respiratory disease.4 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), without exposing patients to ionizing radiation, distinctly reveals mucosal thickening and fluid within the paranasal sinuses. In patients with maxillary sinusitis, serial MRI scans demonstrate mucosal thickening persisting for up to 8 weeks.46 Significant mucosal changes seen on CT or MRI may therefore persist significantly beyond microbiologic resolution of bacterial or viral disease.

Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 79% of adenoids and 46% of lateral walls of the nose in children undergoing adenoidectomy. Molecular typing of pairs of nontypeable H influenzae, S pneumoniae, and M catarrhalis revealed that in 16 of 18 pairs (89%) the identical strain was present in both sites simultaneously. In addition, administration of antimicrobials increases carriage of antimicrobial-resistant strains of these bacterial pathogens.62 Adults also have colonization of the nasopharynx, but duration of carriage is shorter than in children.63 A recent study64 demonstrated that one of the primary respiratory pathogens was recovered from the nasopharynx of approximately 75% of adults.",

            "text": "Macrolide resistance results primarily from alterations in ribosomal binding sites (due to a ribosomal methylase) or expression of an efflux mechanism.73, 74 There are two important genes responsible for macrolide-resistant strains that are most commonly encountered in the clinical setting: erm genes, which code for a ribosomal methylase and mef genes, which code for a macrolide-specific cell membrane-based efflux mechanism. The efflux mechanism confers a relatively moderate degree of resistance, compared to the high level of resistance seen in strains with altered ribosomal binding sites. The efflux mechanism is generally more common in the United States and is relatively uncommon in most other parts of the world. Recently, mechanisms of macrolide resistance were identified that could not be explained by any of the known resistance determinants.75 These novel mechanisms of macrolide resistance involve mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (L4 or L22) or ribosomal RNA (23S rRNA). Mutations in genes for L22 and 23S rRNA result in increased macrolide MICs; however, the effect is variable (MIC range 0.25 \u03bcg/mL to >64 \u03bcg/mL). Mutations in genes for L4 generally confer high-level resistance (MICs >64 \u03bcg/mL).72, 76 Isolates of S pneumoniae expressing these mutant genes are rare but have been identified in several surveillance studies, 76, 77, 78, 79 and there have been several recent reports of macrolide treatment failures resulting from development of these mutations during therapy with macrolides.80, 81, 82, 83, 84 Ribosomal methylase also confers cross-resistance to clindamycin. Macrolide usage, particularly azithromycin, has been associated with the recent increase in S pneumoniae resistance to macrolides in the United States.15\n",

These agents do not kill more efficiently when the concentration exceeds a critical value. While a concentration that is two- to fourfold higher than the MIC is generally regarded as being optimal (ie, greatest likelihood of clinical success), further increasing the drug concentration beyond this magnitude does not improve the rate or extent of bacterial killing. These antibiotics exhibit time-dependent killing, and the best predictor of clinical outcome is the duration of time the concentration at the site of infection remains above the MIC (T > MIC) for the bacteria. In simplistic terms, the antibiotic needs to be at a high-enough concentration for a long-enough period of time at the site of infection. For \u03b2-lactams and extracellular pathogens, the free-drug concentration in serum is generally proportional to that in the interstitial fluid bathing the organism (protein-bound drug lacks antimicrobial activity). Therefore, the proportion of the dosing interval that the free-drug concentration in serum exceeds the antimicrobials MIC against a pathogen also reflects this parameter at most sites of infection. The amount of time that the free-drug concentration of a time-dependent antibiotic remains above the MIC (T > MIC) generally does not vary with the pathogen or the immunocompetence of the host. Data from in vitro pharmacokinetic simulations, animal models, and human clinical studies suggest that the T > MIC needed to achieve bacterial eradication should generally be >40% to 50% of the dosing interval for time-dependent antibiotics.96, 97 The optimal PK/PD parameter varies somewhat for \u03b2-lactams because of variability in the bacterial killing rate. For example, the T > MIC that correlates with optimal outcomes with carbapenems (15% to 25%) is slightly lower than with penicillins (30% to 40%) and cephalosporins (40% to 50%) because carbapenems have a more rapid bacterial killing effect.98\n",

For the antimicrobial with a short half-life, the duration of time between the drug concentration falling below the MIC and its total elimination from the body is relatively short compared to that of the antimicrobial with the longer half-life. For an antimicrobial with a 68-hour half-life (eg, azithromycin), total elimination from the body does not occur for 5 to 7 half-lives or 14 to 20 days. This period of subinhibitory concentrations of drug may be the pharmacodynamic explanation for the aforementioned observations. This concept is controversial and requires validation in future studies, but similar findings have recently been reported in a study from Israel.94\n",

Data obtained from several sources including animal models of sepsis, in vitro pharmacodynamic experiments, and clinical outcome studies indicate that the magnitude of the AUC to MIC ratio can be utilized to predict outcomes. Forrest et al112 demonstrated that an AUC to MIC ratio of \u2265125 was associated with the highest bacterial eradication rates in the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative enteric pathogens. However, for gram-positive bacteria, it appears that effective AUC to MIC ratios can be appreciably lower. For instance, against S pneumoniae, an in vitro model of infection demonstrated that for levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin an AUC to MIC ratio of approximately 30 was associated with a 4-log reduction in bacterial titers; while ratios <30 were associated with significantly reduced rates of bacterial killing and in some instances bacterial regrowth.113 Similarly, Lister and Sanders114 reported that for levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin an AUC-to-MIC ratio of 32 to 44 was associated with maximal eradication of S pneumoniae in an in vitro model of infection. These observations are supported by data from non-neutropenic animal models of infection, in which survival was associated with an AUC-to-MIC ratio of 25 to 30 against the pneumococcus.115\n",

Similarly, some people absorb, metabolize, distribute, and excrete a drug more rapidly than others, and some more slowly, leading to considerable variations in pharmacokinetic parameters.129 As a result of these variations, antimicrobial-agent efficacy in vivo may differ from the in vitro prediction of drug susceptibility in some patients. To determine the true efficacy of an agent in every patient, the MIC of the causative organism against the agent used and the serum pharmacokinetics of the agent would need to be determined in each patient. This is, of course, physically impossible, and has only been performed on a small scale for both practical and ethical reasons.111 Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic breakpoints are, therefore, currently determined from mean serum pharmacokinetic values, which do not reflect variations in pharmacokinetics from patient to patient, so that some patients will not achieve the target needed, while others will exceed the target.130 An example of this using susceptibility of gatifloxacin and levofloxacin against S pneumoniae is shown in Figure 12.\n131 The susceptibility breakpoints for standard dosing regimens of these agents, based on unbound serum AUC divided by 30, is 1 \u03bcg/mL for gatifloxacin and 2 \u03bcg/mL for levofloxacin, and virtually all isolates are \u201csusceptible\u201d at these breakpoints (Figure 12, panels A and B). However, the modal MIC of gatifloxacin is 0.25 \u03bcg/mL, or one quarter of the breakpoint, whereas that of levofloxacin is 1 \u03bcg/mL or one half of the breakpoint.132 Variations in pharmacokinetics between patients are therefore more likely to result in levofloxacin not achieving its target more often than gatifloxacin, as gatifloxacin has a wider \u201csafety margin\u201d than does levofloxacin between MIC values and breakpoints. The variability in pharmacokinetics of these agents in patients enrolled in clinical trials, using dosing regimens of 400 mg once daily for gatifloxacin and 500 mg once daily for levofloxacin, is illustrated in panels C and D of Figure 12. AUC values for gatifloxacin varied from 8 to 500 (mean 64), while values for levofloxacin varied from 17 to 389 (mean 70). The \u201caverage\u201d AUC and modal MIC values for these two agents would therefore result in \u201caverage\u201d AUC:MIC ratios of 256 for gatifloxacin and 70 for levofloxacin. However, the variations in AUCs between patients and in MICs between isolates could result in AUC:MIC ratios varying from 1.5 to 6667 for gatifloxacin and from 3 to 2783 for levofloxacin.131\n",

Rather than subjectively compiling a rank order of antimicrobial agents based on in vitro activity data and expert consensus, we utilized a more objective methodology to assessing treatment options.

Conversely, antimicrobial agents with relatively poor bacteriologic cure rates often appear to be more effective than expected because of the high rate of spontaneous resolution of symptoms.
