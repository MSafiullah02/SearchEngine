The reason for this observation is\nunclear. Besides viral factors, herd immunity, particularly the pre-existing NAbs in\na population, may influence the spread of a virus.20 As an imprint of the immunoresponse, NAbs in specific\npopulations can not only trace the history of infection but also predict the\nsusceptibility to a certain pathogen.21\nBecause EV infections are usually asymptomatic or mild,22 the data obtained from RTI patients seeking medical\nservices could grossly underestimate the actual incidence and prevalence. To reveal\nan accurate epidemiological picture of an emerging virus infection, serological\ninvestigations based on NAb detection in the general population are therefore of\nparticular importance to assess the prevalence and the transmission potential of\nEV-D68 for taking public measures to prevent this emerging epidemic.22",
