Although the mutation rate is limited, recently introduced mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to alter viral fitness. In addition to amino acid changes, mutations could affect RNA secondary structure critical to viral life cycle, or interfere with sequences targeted by host miRNAs. We have analysed subsets of genomes from SARS-CoV-2 isolates from around the globe and show that several mutations introduce changes in Watson-Crick pairing, with resultant changes in predicted secondary structure. Filtering to targets matching miRNAs expressed in SARS-CoV-2 permissive host cells, we identified twelve separate target sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; eight of these targets have been lost through conserved mutations. A genomic site targeted by the highly abundant miR-197-5p, overexpressed in patients with cardiovascular disease, is lost by a conserved mutation. Our results are compatible with a model that SARS-CoV-2 replication within the human host could be constrained by host miRNA defence. The impact of these and further mutations on secondary structures, miRNA targets or potential splice sites offers a new context in which to view future SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and a potential platform for engineered viral attenuation and antigen presentation.",

Host selection pressure on SARS-CoV-2 virus would be expected to have a major impact on the conservation of mutations that enhance viral fitness. Of these selection pressures, the cellular-based adaptive and innate immune systems will be major constraints to viral evolution. Intracellular detection and anti-viral pathways within infected cells are a critical frontline to control virus replication. The success of the SARS coronaviruses is proposed to be due to their ability to suppress intracellular anti-viral pathways. For example, interference with dsRNA detection and the interferon response is enabled through the activity of several nonstructural proteins (Nsp). In addition, the sequestration of genomic viral RNA into double membrane vesicles, and dsRNA cleavage by Nsp15, is inferred from the closely related SARS-CoV-1 virus, and likely acts to prevent intracellular detection of the virus [1] . In addition to encoded mechanisms of immune avoidance, the paucity of CpG runs in SARS-CoV-2 genome with unexpectedly low GC-content at codon position-three points to major selection pressure being placed on structural features of the genome [2] .",

However, extensive mutation and strain-radiation has not yet been observed [3] . The low mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2 is reduced by the activity of the 3' -5' exonuclease Nsp14 in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex. An alternative possibility is that the observed mutation rate is lower than the actual mutation rate, but that deleterious mutations have already been lost through natural selection. The short time frame of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, coupled to a low mutation rate is consistent with a founder effect for geographical bias in mutation patterns [3] .",

The mutations present in multiple sequences and in at least in three different countries were categorized as 'conserved mutations' [52] . In the line with previous reports, we confirmed the occurrence of conserved mutations at positions 1397 (Nsp2), 3037 (Nsp3), 8782 (Nsp4), 11083 (Nsp6), 14408 (Nsp12), 23403 (S), 26143 (ORF3a) and 28144/ 28881 (N) [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . We also considered nine additional conserved mutations with occurrence in multiple countries (Table 1 & S1). Most of these mutations are substitutions of C/G to U. The high A/U content (U= 32.1%/ A= 29.9%/ G= 19.6%/ C=18.4%) and enrichment of codons in in pyrimidines is likely due to APOBEC editing of viral RNA and the fact that Nsp14 (proof-reading) does not remove U (the product of cytosine deamination) [57] . Two mutations at 241 and 29742, are in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Seven mutations are silent point mutations, including 313, 14805, 17247 and 28686, while the others result in amino acid changes ( Table 1) . None of these amino acid changes are conservative substitutions. Interestingly, the C27964U (S24L in ORF8) exists only in 97 USA sequences, with the earliest isolated in March 9 th (MT325581.1), after USA underwent lockdown [58] ( Figure S1 ). ",

First, a conserved mutation 1059 in Nsp2 changed the secondary structure of Nsp2 dramatically ( Figure   1A ). This mutation also increased the Watson-Crick base-pair probability -predicted to result in more stable RNA secondary structure ( Figure 1B , C, D & E). This mutation had no effect on RNA accessibility which is a consideration for RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions ( Figure 1F ). Mutation 29742 occurs in a conserved region within 3\u2032 UTR known as the coronavirus 3' stem-loop II-like motif (s2m). This mutation has significant effect on secondary structure of the 3\u2032 UTR (Figure 2A & B) . It is wellknown that s2m present in most Coronaviruses and plays a vital role in viral replication and invasion [60] [61] [62] .",

The expression level of miR-338-3p declines during HBV infection [76, 77] and miR-338-3p has a recognition site within Vaccinia virus genome [78] . Also, The G24057A mutation present in an sequence from Brazil (GISAID: EPI_ISL_429691), destroys the complementarity of the miR-338-3p binding site. Of interest, two more conserved mutations C22277A (Q239K) and A23403G (D614G) occur in binding sites for miR-29b-3p and miR-4793-5p, respectively. Lastly, G25311U in a patient sample isolated India (MT396242.1) removed the miR-4661-3p binding site within the S gene ( Figure 4 ). In addition to the sites mentioned here, we identified an additional four host miRNAs with perfect complementarity within the receptor binding domain (RBD) region of S gene ( Figure 5 ). These miRNA are not expressed by SARS-CoV-2 target cells (data not shown). However, because these sites exist within the critical ACE-2 targeting region, these miRNA target sequences may be relevant to miRNA-mediated virus attenuation technology. For example, viral replication can attenuated in a species-specific and tissue-specific manner by host miRNA machinery, which controls viral tropism, replication and pathogenesis [30] [31] [32] . ",

The Nsp14 exonuclease-based proof-reader is a critical counter-defence against host base-editor attack on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

There is little evidence that the existing mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have an impact on transmission, replication or viral load, but our study has flagged potential sites that could impact on viral fitness. It remains to be seen if these mutations undergo purifying selection in human populations over time. Carriage of SARS-CoV-2 mutations through the rapid expansion into naive populations throughout the world is most likely due to a neutral founder effects, rather than from fitness gains. For example, the high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations is close to the expected value for an emerging virus that has not undergone purifying selection [3] .",

The Korber et al. study showed that the A23403G did not enhance spike protein binding to ACE-2, however the mutation may be associated with higher viral load and poorer clinical outcomes. Our own analysis demonstrated that this mutation abolished a potential interaction with miR-4793-5p, a miRNA highly expressed in target cells including oesophagus, lung epithelium and small intestine.

The possibility of including host miRNA binding sites into the genome of live-attenuated viruses offers a further checkpoint for the further attenuation of live vaccines, in a host-cell specific manner. For example, the identification of miRNA target sites in viral pathogens opens up opportunities for further study of viral host cell-tropism, or to create cellspecific or species-specific viral vaccines [30] [31] [32] . Finally, miRNA sites within the CDS of viral genes may be critical for ribosomal stalling, leading to the production of pioneer translation products (PTP). Enhanced production of PTP peptides may be critical for MHC-I loading for boosting the anti-viral CTL response [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

(B) The base pair probabilities by circular plots with higher base pairing potential is reflected in darker hues of gray lines and the mutated position highlighted by red arrow (MutaRNA). (C) The upper and lower triangle of the matrix represents the base pair probabilities of wild-type and mutant sequences, respectively, as visualized by RNAsnp (p value = 0.2617, p value < 0.2 is significant). (D) The dot plot provides the absolute differences of the base pairing probabilities of mutated vs. wildtype RNA. The upper right part of (top-left) visualizes weakening of the base pairing potential, while the lower left reports base pairs with increased probability within the mutant. Again, darker hues reflect higher absolute changes. The mutated position is highlighted by red dotted lines.
