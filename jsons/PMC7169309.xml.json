The conventional reactive approach to wait until the threat from an emerging transfusion\u2010transmitted agent has been identified before responding by modifying donor screening programmes takes time and, ultimately, the response may not be quick enough to prevent the transfusion of contaminated blood products.

One limitation of this study is that the number of replicates was small due to safety constraints \u2013 laboratory studies with these zoonotic viruses must be performed in accordance with the highest biosafety requirements.

It emerged in 2002 in China and spread to 29 additional countries and is thought to be an animal virus that spread to humans from civets most likely infected by bats 27. Similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), the main route of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of SARS\u2010CoV is nosocomial transmission. However, transmission between family members has also been observed, suggesting that SARS\u2010CoV might continue to spread via transmission by infected persons returning from affected areas. Transmission by blood transfusion has not been described yet. Nevertheless, the high mortality of the disease and the not yet fully understood transmission mechanisms of SARS\u2010CoV pose a potential threat to the safety of the blood supply 27. Interestingly, the detection of low\u2010level viremia in asymptomatic patients during an SARS\u2010CoV outbreak suggests a theoretical risk of transmission via blood products. As a precautionary measure, the World Health Organization introduced a recommendation for the deferral of blood donations from donors potentially exposed to SARS\u2010CoV, and the Australian Red Cross Blood Service amended its donor screening questionnaire to include questions to identify persons with SARS\u2010CoV\u2010related symptoms 28.",

CCHFV often results in a mild, non\u2010specific febrile illness but may occasionally cause severe haemorrhagic disease. This disease was first identified in the Crimean region of the former Soviet Union in 1944 and is a significant public health concern. CCHFV occurs across a wide geographic region, including Europe, Asia and Africa, and may expand into new regions 29. The virus is usually transmitted to humans through contact with infected ticks and animal blood, but it is also transmissible from human to human via exposure to infected blood and other body fluids. Although no cases of CCHFV transmission by blood transfusion have been reported to date, incidences of hospital\u2010acquired CCHFV infection due to contaminated medical instruments have been documented 30.

It was reported for the first time in the Malaysian population in 1998 and reappeared on different occasions in Asia.

NiV is a zoonotic virus transmitted to humans from animals such as bats or pigs, but it can also be transmitted through contaminated foods or directly person\u2010to\u2010person through close contact with virus\u2010containing body fluids and excretions 32. The available data, particularly the findings on viral load in different body fluids, are too limited to provide a full understanding of its transmission routes 33. Transfusion has not been implicated as a potential transmission pathway to date. The incubation period of up to 14 days and the occurrence of latent infections with subsequent reactivation of NiV months and even years after exposure suggest that infected persons may be overlooked by donor screening programmes. However, the potential transfusion risk may be limited by the fact that asymptomatic and mild NiV infections are rare.",

If one or more of these viruses is transfusion transmissible, its threshold concentration to elicit disease must be examined to determine whether the capacity of these pathogen inactivation technologies to inactivate the respective virus in plasma and PCs is sufficient to prevent transfusion transmission. Interpreting pathogen load in relationship to infectivity and inactivation efficacy is generally a very complex task 34. When attempting to do so, it is important to consider that because quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the most commonly used approach, measures viral load by detecting a small fragment of the viral genome, the results may not reflect infectivity and that qPCR usually overestimates the titre of circulating infectious agents 34. In contrast, infectivity assays, which were used in this and previous studies 5, 12, 13, 14, determine the inactivation capacity of a pathogen inactivation method based on intact, functional viral units. Nevertheless, the log reduction factors observed in this study and the safety margins calculated from the inactivation levels achieved using only a fraction of the standard light dose suggest that the THERAFLEX UV\u2010Platelets and THERAFLEX MB\u2010Plasma pathogen inactivation technologies may effectively reduce the potential risk of SARS\u2010CoV, CCHFV and NiV and related viruses for platelet or plasma transfusion.",
