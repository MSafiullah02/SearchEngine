Patient enrolment was done by the department of Paediatrics at Hitech Medical College and Hospital, and laboratory investigations were carried out at virology Grade I laboratory of Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar. Children below the age of five years, admitted to the paediatric ward and the PICU with diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and having wheezing (either auscultatory or audible), were selected consecutively as the study patients for virological investigations. Exclusion criteria were children above the age of five years, those presenting with or developing status asthmaticus and children whose parents did not provide consent for inclusion in the study. Every patient admitted to the paediatric ward or PICU with wheezing during the study period after screening for exclusion criteria was included in the study, and throat and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for viral investigation.",

The aetiological causes were divided based on the recommendation by the European Respiratory task force into allergic (multitrigger wheeze-which was defined as wheezing, both during discrete exacerbations and between episodes, triggered by both viral and non-viral agents such as allergens, exercise and cigarette smoke) and infective causes i.e., bronchiolitis (which was defined as the first episode of wheezing in a child <24 months of age, who has physical findings of a viral lower respiratory infection and no other explanation for wheezing), pneumonia (clinically defined as tachypnoea with fever) and episodic wheeze or viral wheeze (which was defined as wheezing occurring during discrete time periods with symptom-free period between episodes, usually associated with viral respiratory tract infection)78.",

Of these 75 children, five were excluded from the study based on the exclusion criteria, and samples of 70 children were sent for viral RNA markers. The viral aetiology could be observed in 28.57 per cent (n=20) of cases. Viral genome could be detected in three cases of pneumonia, nine cases of bronchiolitis, two cases of episodic wheeze and six cases of multitrigger wheeze. Details of viral RNA markers are given in the (Table). In this study, wheezing was observed in 40 per cent of children with respiratory infection, with a mean age of 14.11\u00b112.74 months. Of the 75 children, 56 (75%) were male. Cough was the main presenting complaint (93%, n=70), followed by nasal discharge and respiratory distress (74%, n=55) and fever (64%, n=48). Additional symptoms such as watering of the eyes and skin rashes were seen in seven (n=5) and five (n=4) per cent cases, respectively. While all the children had auscultatory rhonchi, 36 per cent of them had audible wheeze. Tachypnoea and crepitation were seen in 71 per cent of children, retractions in 60 per cent, nasal flaring in 59 per cent and grunting was seen in four per cent children.",
