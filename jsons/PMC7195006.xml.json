The quality and/or magnitude of the antibody response is an important correlate of protection against many pathogens, including viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Couch et al., 2013, Subbarao et al., 2004). IAV is a particularly large public health burden, with seasonal IAV strains incurring significant morbidity and mortality annually (estimated 50 million cases, 1 million hospitalizations, and 80 thousand deaths in the 2017-2018 season) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). Though vaccination is an important component of influenza control, existing influenza vaccines often exhibit low efficacy. While this is partially due to antigenic mismatch between vaccines and circulating influenza strains (Lewnard and Cobey, 2018), numerous studies have shown that some individuals fail to mount a sufficient protective antibody response upon vaccination (Wiedermann et al., 2016).",

These factors include age, underlying disease states, and prior exposure history to related pathogens or vaccines (Lewnard and Cobey, 2018). Despite some dissent (Brodin et al., 2015), multiple studies across different pathogens and vaccines indicate that antibody responses have a strong heritable component, with many estimates of \u223c50% (Kruskall et al., 1992, Linnik and Egli, 2016, Ovsyannikova et al., 2012). In the case of the measles vaccine, the antibody response was nearly 90% heritable, suggesting that genetics are a predominant factor contributing to interindividual variation in vaccine response (Tan et al., 2001). Despite this strong evidence for the role of genetic variation in modulating antibody response, the genetic factors regulating antibody response to IAV are unknown. Complicating this type of analysis is the fact that antibody response is the downstream result of a complex immunological process involving multiple tissues, cell types, and cell signaling pathways. Genes underlying variation in antibody response may be involved in any stage of the response, from general regulatory aspects of B cell development to more IAV-specific effects such as innate immune sensing. An understanding of naturally polymorphic genes involved in the antibody response, how they function, and whether their effects are broad or pathogen specific could lead to improved vaccine design, such as by utilization of adjuvants that specifically target relevant pathways and boost antibody response.",

            "text": "Despite the importance of understanding genetic regulation of pathogen-specific immune responses, identifying and studying genetic determinants of host antibody responses or other aspects of immunity is challenging in humans. Demographic and environmental factors such as viral dose and prior immune history affect immune responses to infection or vaccination (Lewnard and Cobey, 2018) and confound analyses. Furthermore, a lack of replicates in outbred humans, as well as difficulties accessing relevant tissues, presents challenges for phenotyping and mechanistic validation. Historically, mouse models have been used to overcome many of the logistical, experimental, and ethical issues that confound human studies. The genetic tractability of the mouse genome, including the ready availability of many gene-specific knockouts, and the ability to easily generate new knockouts, has provided key insights into the host pathways that control both development of the immune system and the quality and durability of vaccine-induced immunity (Li et al., 2008, Vidal et al., 2008). Increasingly, it is appreciated that standard laboratory mouse strains do not recapitulate the genetic diversity observed in the outbred human population (Saul et al., 2019), and this lack of diversity has limited the utility of the mouse in identifying polymorphic genes and pathways that contribute to the variation in the adaptive immune responses observed in humans.",

CC strains have fixed and known genomes, facilitating genetic mapping to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) driving phenotypes of interest (Keele et al., 2018). Studies across multiple pathogens have highlighted the utility of the CC for studying infectious disease outcomes; CC mice show disease phenotypes as diverse as their genetics, facilitating discovery of novel and extreme phenotypes as well as in QTL mapping (reviewed in Noll et al., 2019). Furthermore, use of the CC enables analysis of correlations between mapped QTL and additional phenotypes across studies, extending the ability to interpret the breadth of phenotypic effect of mapped loci beyond the context in which they were originally mapped. Relevant to this study, CC mice display a wide range of phenotypes in response to challenge with IAV (Ferris et al., 2013, Kollmus et al., 2018, Maurizio et al., 2017) as well as variation in antibody glycosylation (Kri\u0161ti\u0107 et al., 2018).",

This population provided a reproducible population of heterozygous animals to mimic the genetic heterozygosity of the human population (see Data S1 for full list of the F1s with complete strain names including laboratory codes). Our analysis focused on HA-specific antibody responses, as the bulk of the anti-IAV antibody response is directed against the HA protein, and HA-specific antibody responses are most correlated with protective neutralization (Johansson et al., 1987). Female mice from 116 CC-F1s were infected intranasally with IAV A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) and sacrificed at multiple time points post-infection (3 mice per CC-F1 at each time point for a total of \u223c1,350 mice). IAV-specific antibody was measured from animals sacrificed at days 7, 10, 15, and 45 post-infection to capture both early and late humoral immune responses. IgM, IgG1, IgG2a+IgG2c (combined detection of subtypes that segregate across mouse strains (Zhang et al., 2012b)), IgG2b, IgG3, and total IgG were quantified from each animal (a total of \u223c8,000 antibody measurements across the 116 CC-F1s and 4 time points) to capture differential dynamics of individual antibody subtypes and isotypes across our infection time course.",

A number of F1s showed abnormal IgM responses, with later peaks (e.g., at day 15, CC012xCC038 and CC032xCC017) or increasing through day 45 (e.g., CC011xCC032; Figure 1D).

Similar to the variation in antibody response (Figure 1), CC-F1s exhibited a wide range of disease outcomes following IAV infection, ranging from asymptomatic to severe weight loss and mortality (Figure S2). We have previously shown that these differences in disease susceptibility can largely be attributed to variation in the IAV resistance gene Mx1 (Maurizio et al., 2017), although other smaller effect loci also contribute to variation in IAV susceptibility (Ferris et al., 2013). Given the role of Mx1 in regulating both disease susceptibility and viral load, we assessed whether Mx1 haplotype correlated with the antibody response. Protective Mx1 haplotypes (associated with decreased viral load and weight loss) showed some relationship with decreased antibody response throughout infection, with the strongest relationship seen early in infection (days 7 and 10) and with IgG1 and IgG3 (Table S1). However, these relationships waned over time and were not sufficient to fully explain the variation in antibody responses we observed throughout our study. In order to further clarify the role of Mx1 and viral load in influencing antibody responses, we measured viral load by genome copy assay at day 2 post-infection for a subset of CC-F1s selected for either high or low IgG responses at day 10 post-infection. We observed no trend between viral load and IgG levels on any day post-infection (Figure S3). We also assessed whether the antibody response was associated with IAV-induced disease as measured by maximal weight loss, with control for Mx1 haplotype. We observed correlations between maximal weight loss and the IgG1 response across time points, in addition to with early IgM and late total IgG (Table S2), with increased antibody levels associated with enhanced weight loss. These observations suggest that there is a relationship between antibody response and the severity of virus-induced disease that is independent of Mx1-mediated effects.",

For this analysis, we took advantage of existing datasets from related but independent studies with SARS-CoV, a respiratory virus, and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arbovirus. In the SARS-CoV study, mice from a similar panel of CC-F1s were infected with SARS-CoV, and antibody response to the spike (S) protein was measured at days 7, 15, and 29 post-infection. An additional measurement was taken 4 days following a secondary challenge (\u201crechallenge\u201d), which was administered at day 28 post-primary infection. Ari1 haplotypes were not associated with SARS-CoV-specific antibody responses (Table S6). In contrast, Ari2 haplotype showed broad associations with antibody specific to SARS-CoV at days 7 and 29, and with IgM at all time points post-primary and secondary challenge (Table S6). Ari3 haplotype showed only a few correlations with SARS-CoV antibody, which were not indicative of trends either across isotypes or time points (Table S6). Ari4 showed the strongest correlations with the SARS-CoV-specific antibody response, most potently at day 7 but lasting through days 15 and 29 (Table S6). In the CHIKV study, mice from a panel of 64 inbred CC strains were infected with CHIKV. Virus-specific IgM, IgG, and neutralizing antibody were measured at day 7 post-infection. While Ari1, Ari2, and Ari4 did not correlate with the CHIKV-specific antibody response (IgM, IgG, and neutralization titer) in CC-RI mice at day 7 post-infection, Ari3 haplotypes showed strong associations with the CHIKV antibody response (Table S6). Interestingly, these associations were in the opposite direction as observed for IAV (i.e., WSB/EiJ haplotype associated with decreased antibody response). Overall, these findings suggest that Ari1 is uniquely associated with variation in IAV-specific antibody responses, while Ari2\u2013Ari4 show broader effects on virus-specific antibody responses. Ari2 and Ari4 are associated with variation in SARS-CoV-specific antibody responses, while Ari3 was also found to be strongly associated with variation in the CHIKV-specific antibody response.",

Next, candidate SNPs were categorized based on the classification of the affected genetic element (e.g., regulatory region, protein-coding gene, or non-coding RNA). While variation in regulatory regions, microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), or other genetic elements may drive QTLs, we focused on SNPs in protein-coding genes for our analysis, as they have more interpretable and better defined functional consequences. The protein-coding genes at each locus were next evaluated based on whether the gene exhibited baseline expression in the lung or immune tissue (i.e., spleen or thymus) utilizing ENCODE data (Yue et al., 2014).",

These differences, which did not widely correlate with general susceptibility to IAV-induced disease, were leveraged to map 23 QTLs associated with variation in specific antibody isotypes across time points. Multiple significant and suggestive QTLs were identified, including Ari1\u2013Ari4, which likely drive variation in IAV-specific antibody response through different mechanisms. Ari loci also showed effects on the antibody response to SARS-CoV and CHIKV, suggesting that these QTLs are broadly important for antibody response to multiple pathogens. Candidate genes for Ari loci have been identified and show overlap with genes identified in human studies. Overall, our findings demonstrate that multiple independent loci regulate the magnitude, kinetics, and composition of IAV-specific antibody. These results further demonstrate the utility of the CC for modeling how host genetic variation shapes pathogen-specific immunity and open the door to more robust modeling of the complex interplay between genetics and environment in promoting protective adaptive immune responses to pathogens.",

Following this final pooling, the library pools were sized to a target size of 260bp on a Pippin Prep instrument using the 2% Pippin Agarose gel. The sized libraries were examined on an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA chip, quantified using real-time PCR, and used to prepare spheres using a One-Touch 2 device.

We took the 36-state probability files from the CC Most Recent Common Ancestors (MRCAs) consensuses for each strain and simplified these to 8-state probabilities as previously described (Srivastava et al., 2017). For each CC-F1, we averaged the 8-state probabilities of the two parent CC strains. This approach is the most accurate for F1 animals, as they will receive only one allele from each parent CC strain. For genetic mapping in DOQTL, a multiple regression is run at each marker, running the phenotype of interest against haplotype probabilities for each strain. LOD scores are calculated based on the improvement of fit in this model compared to a null model considering only covariates and kinship. To determine significance, permutation tests were run in which phenotype and genotype data are shuffled without replacement to generate a series of null LOD scores, of which the highest is archived. Based on 1000 permutations, we determined null distributions. We calculated p value scores by empirical cumulative distribution function, comparing the maximum LOD score for a QTL to the distribution of null permutations.

Bar heights represent mean raw area under the curve (AUC) values across all CC-F1s. (B) The correlation structure of antibody isotypes and subtype responses in the F1s over time was evaluated to determine the relationship between the development of various antibody types across the population. (C and D) Representative examples of variation in the magnitude and kinetics of IgG (C) and IgM (D), with some exceptionally notable outliers for IgM. Each point represents an individual mouse, and bars represent mean values for F1s. (D). This variation was independent of Mx1 haplotype (for both panel sets red = Mx1 \u2212/\u2212, blue = Mx1 +/\u2212). See also Figures S1\u2013S3.",

(A, D, G, and J) Phenotypic distributions for the traits mapped to Ari1\u2013Ari4, respectively. Each plot is independently ordered by the CC-F1 means for that trait (black points) and also shows the individual mice (purple points). The exception is (J), which only shows mean values, as the ratios of antibody response between time points were calculated using the mean value for each F1 at the relevant individual time points. (B, E, H, and K) show the associated QTL LOD plots (significance score across the genome) for Ari1\u2013Ari4. Significance thresholds are shown in red (genome-wide p = 0.05), blue (p = 0.1), and green (p = 0.2). Following identification of QTLs, we determined the causal haplotypes driving these responses (C, F, I, and L). Each plot is zoomed in to the relevant QTL loci on the x axis. The lower black line shows the LOD score for that region, and the colored lines display the estimated effect of each of the 8 CC founder haplotypes (A/J = yellow, C57BL/6J = gray, 129S1/SvImJ = pink, NOD/ShiLtJ = dark blue, NZO/HlLtJ = light blue, CAST/EiJ = green, PWK/PhJ = red, and WSB/EiJ = purple). Causal haplotype groups are determined based on direction and distance from mean effect and the largest split distance between lines (e.g., in I, the WSB line is furthest away from all others).",
