To anticipate additional resources to combat the epidemic, mathematical and statistical modeling tools can be useful to generate timely short-term forecasts of reported cases. These predictions can include estimates of expected morbidity burden that can help guide public health officials preparing the medical care and other resources needed to confront the epidemic. Short-term forecasts can also guide the intensity and type of interventions needed to mitigate an epidemic (Funk, Camacho, Kucharski, Eggo, & Edmunds, 2016; Shanafelt, Jones, Lima, Perrings, & Chowell, 2017) . In the absence of vaccines or antiviral drugs for 2019-nCoV, the effective implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as personal protection and social distancing, will be critical to bring the epidemic under control.",

Importantly, the curves of confirmed cases that we employ in our study are reported according to reporting date and could be influenced by testing capacity and other related factors. Further, there may be significant delays in identifying, isolating, and reporting cases in Hubei due to the magnitude of the epidemic, which could influence our predictions. Incidence curves according to the date of symptom onset could provide a clearer picture of the transmission dynamics during an epidemic. We also note that we analyzed the epidemic curves starting on January 22, 2020, but the epidemic started in December 2019. Hence, the first data point accumulates cases up until January 22, 2020, as data were not available prior to this date.",

In future work, we plan to report the results of a retrospective analysis of forecasting performance across models based on various performance metrics.",
