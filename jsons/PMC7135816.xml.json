Although we have moved on, an air of tension still surrounds this disease, particularly in the corridors of power within the international health and political communities, and apprehension remains about what the continued pandemic in poultry means for human health. Human H5N1 infections thankfully remain rare, but evidence has accumulated that in some circumstances H5N1 viruses are capable of limited person-to-person transmission.",

Apparent host-induced selection of a human-adapted H5N1 virus has been reported,12 but most sequence analyses of viruses isolated from sporadic and clustered cases show no substantial differences from the strains found in poultry. However, most of these analyses used viruses isolated from human specimens in cell cultures of animal origin, thus grown under different selective pressures from those in human respiratory tracts. Whether better adapted viral subpopulations exist during human infection is unknown, as is the diversity in virus populations in individual human beings or poultry. A possible lack of host-induced evolutionary pressure, disseminated viral replication and high viral loads in infected people,13 and the rarity of person-to-person transmission suggest that the infecting avian viruses might be already well adapted to the individual in which they find themselves, but not to the wider human population.",

Although this finding could be related to the intensity and intimacy of contact between family members, host genetic factors might also play a part in susceptibility to H5N1, and when we see limited person-to-person transmission we might be observing an interaction between two well matched subpopulations. Studying both within-host virus diversity and host genetic diversity might help to clarify the nature of the species barrier and the conditions necessary for widespread transmission between people. These studies are hard to do and need sustained, coordinated, and collaborative efforts, as in Wang and colleagues' study,9 coupled with acceptance that person-to-person transmission of H5N1 can and does happen.",

In the meantime, all family contacts of a patient with probable or confirmed H5N1 should be given chemoprophylaxis and placed under surveillance. Personal protection and advice must be extended to the family members and health workers visiting and looking after patients in hospital. These steps rely on having systems capable of detecting cases and clusters early enough to start treatment and isolation, to identify and protect contacts, and to assess the extent of transmission.",
