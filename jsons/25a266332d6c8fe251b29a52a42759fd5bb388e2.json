We call it the moderate class of infections. Its medoid is Monroe county in Pennsylvania. There were 28 counties in the third class with the highest overall cumulative confirmed cases, which we named as the severe class of infections. Its medoid is Fairfield county in Connecticut. The geographical distribution of the counties in different classes is shown in Figure 1 , where the size of a circle indicated the total confirmed cases on April 15, 2020. Note that the east and west coasts were the most severely hit areas by COVID-19. Most counties in New York and New Jersey belonged to the third class of counties(9).",

The higher population may increase more contacts in the social distancing (17), leading to a higher risk in the deaths of COVID-19. On the contrary, higher percentage of residents living in rural areas in the mild infections class of counties may reduce the mortality. The segregation index between non-White and White revealed the disparity in health between non-White and White, leading to differences in health status not only at the individuals level but also at the community level (18).

This health inequality had a positive association with the mortality of COVID-19 in the mild and the severe class of counties.For the mild class of counties, higher number of reported violent crime offenses per 100,000 population indicated the poor community safety, and a higher percentage of long-distance commuting workforce was linked to the high level of anxiety for commuters(19). These two factors combined may increase psychological distress and subsequently make people feel vulnerable to COVID-19(20-22).For the moderate class of counties, gender and racial differences in the population were linked to the persons contracting a new disease, where being female and Hispanic populations may be less protective to the COVID-19. Also, more people reported to stay in ambulatory-care sensitive conditions and more workforce driving alone to work indicated poor health status, leading to the high mortality in COVID-19.However, there was a higher percentage of people reported to have access to exercise in locations, resulting in the increase of mortality of COVID-19. This may be caused by gathering and crowding in the exercise locations (23, 24). Thus, reducing the access to exercise in those locations may improve the safety of the public.",

COVID -19 deaths were significantly associated with the ratio of population to primary care physicians, namely the adequacy of medical resources. If enough medical staff were available, the infected population could be treated promptly, thereby could reduce the deaths. Conclusions There are different key factors influencing the mortality of COVID-19 in across different counties in the United States. Regardless of the regions, the factors linked to the poor health status contributed to increasing mortality of COVID-19. Improving the health system and eliminating the racial disparity to enhance health equity, combining with reducing outdoor physical activities in the metropolitan areas could significantly decrease the mortality of COVID-19.Therefore, it is recommended that governments in different regions should reduce physical and psychological risks in residential environments to reduce the mortality of COVID-19.",
