The cellular infiltrate may be lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, or combinations of these.2.\nWhat causes IBD?\nThe cause of IBD is probably multifactoral. It appears to involve host hypersensitivity responses to antigens (food, bacterial, or self) within the bowel lumen or mucosa. Genetic and psychosocial factors also may be involved. Increased permeability allows luminal antigens to cross the mucosa, leading to inflammation and further mucosal damage, which in turn further increase permeability. Mucosal inflammation occurs in a diverse group of disorders, including bacterial, viral, protozoal, and parasitic infections, bacterial overgrowth, metabolic disease, neoplasia, pancreatitis, and cholangiohepatitis. These conditions should be excluded from the differential list before a cat is assumed to have IBD due to dietary hypersensitivity.3.\nDescribe the pathophysiology of IBD.\nIBD is an abnormal mucosal immune response, which results in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the intestine. The immune response itself leads to tissue destruction and impairment of digestive and absorptive capabilities. Damage results from the following factors:\u2022Arachidonic acid metabolites\u2022Proinflammatory cytokines\u2022Leukotrienes, produced in the lipoxygenase pathway, that act as chemotactic agents, increase vascular permeability, and induce smooth muscle contraction\u2022Prostaglandins from the cyclo-oxygenase pathway, which result in pain, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and increased secretion of water and electrolytes\u2022Platelet-activating factor, which is chemotactic and increases vascular permeability\u2022Interleukins. which regulate the mucosal immune system\u2022Oxygen-derived free radicals and nitric oxide, which damage the mucosa\u2022GI peptides, including substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and somatostatin\u2022Clonal expansion of activated intestinal B and T lymphocytes.\n4.\nDescribe the typical signalment for cats with IBD.\nThere is no age, sex, or breed predilection, although purebred cats may be at increased risk for lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis. Although most affected cats are middle aged (6\u20138 years) or older, about one-third of the patients are 2 years old or younger. IBD has been diagnosed as early as 5 months of age.5.\nWhat are the common clinical signs of IBD?\nChronic vomiting and diarrhea are the most common clinical signs and may occur alone or in combination. Vomiting often is not associated with eating and should be differentiated from regurgitation (see Chapter 26). Diarrhea may contain mucus or blood, indicating large bowel involvement. Anorexia, weight loss, lethargy, loss of litter training, abdominal pain, and hematemesis also may be seen. The clinical signs are generally intermittent or cyclical and reflect the predominant sites of disease. Clinical signs are similar among the various histologic forms. Symptoms vary from mild to severe. Exacerbations and spontaneous remissions are common.6.\nWhat characteristic abnormalities are found on physical examination?\nNo physical examination findings are pathognomonic, but several findings may suggest IBD. Cranial abdominal discomfort may be present and is more noticeable in cats with concurrent pancreatitis. Intestinal bowel loops may be thickened. Cats with \u201ctriaditis\u201d\u2014the combination of inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, and cholangiohepatitis\u2014may be icteric and have a palpable liver. Many cats are ill kempt, and emaciation may be noted, particularly if malabsorption is occurring.7.\nWhat are the primary differential diagnoses for IBD?\n\u2022Endocrine diseases (hyperthyroidism, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency)\u2022Food intolerance\u2022Bacterial enteritis (Helicobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli; see Chapter 20)\u2022\nParasites (helminths, cestodes, protozoans; see Chapter 19)\u2022Fungal enteritis (Histoplasma capsulatum; see Chapter 22)\u2022Neoplasia (lymphosarcoma, adenoma, adenocarcinoma; see Chapter 24)\u2022Viral enteritis (feline leukemia virus [FeLV], feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV], feline enteric coronavirus, feline panleukopenia; see Chapter 21)\u2022Obstruction\n8.\nHow is IBD diagnosed?\nIBD is diagnosed by combining histologic evidence of inflammation with exclusion of other causes of GI inflammation. Baseline laboratory tests should include complete blood count (CBC), serum biochemical profile, FeLV antigen test, FIV antibody test, serum total T4 concentration (for cats at risk for hyperthyroidism), urinalysis, fecal parasite examination (zinc sulfate flotation and direct smear), fecal wet mount, Cryptosporidium spp. screening, rectal cytology, and survey abdominal radiographs (see Chapter 18). Fecal culture is indicated in cats with suspected bacterial enteritis (see Chapter 20).9.\nWhat CBC abnormalities support the diagnosis of IBD?\nThe CBC may show increased eosinophils. However, parasitic diseases and hypoadrenocorticism also induce this abormormality. Microcytic anemia may develop if IBD is severe and results in iron deficiency due to chronic blood loss. Plasma protein concentration decreases if protein-losing enteropathy is present.10.\nHow do serum biochemical abnormalities aid in the diagnosis of IBD?\nThe primary benefit of serum biochemical testing is to exclude other causes of vomiting and diarrhea. Panhypoproteinemia is consistent with protein-losing enteropathy, which may occur with some forms of IBD. Some cats (25%) with lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis are reported to have mildly increased serum alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate transferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities. Liver function tests are usually normal; in some cats, however, histologic examination of the liver reveals periportal inflammatory infiltrates. Because the pancreatic and biliary ducts are shared in cats and empty into the duodenum, IBD may result in concurrent pancreatitis and cholangiohepatitis (see Chapters 29 and 36). This syndrome has been called \u201ctriaditis\u201d and may explain serum biochemical evidence of hepatic and pancreatic involvement. Triaditis may be due to translocation of bacteria from the diseased GI tract into the portal circulation. Cobalamin, folate, and vitamin K levels may be decreased as a result of malabsorption.11.\nWhat is the diagnostic benefit of imaging procedures?\nSurvey and contrast films of the abdomen have a low likelihood of showing abnormalities (masses or increased small intestinal diameter). Barium studies may show flocculation of barium contrast material, irregular mucosal-barium interface, delayed transit time, or persistent adherence of barium to mucosa. Ultrasound may show small intestinal abnormalities, including altered echogenicity, small intestinal wall thickening, or poor small intestinal wall definition. However, results of imaging procedures are not specific for IBD and are used primarily to exclude other causes of vomiting or diarrhea.12.\nHow should tissues be obtained for histologic evaluation?\nEndoscopically obtained or full-thickness surgical biopsies may be used for histologic evaluation. Endoscopic mucosal biopsy is less invasive than surgery but provides small samples (usually 2.8 mm in diameter at most) that include mucosa only. Samples are easily obtained from the stomach, duodenum, rectum, and colon; the jejunum and ileum are less commonly sampled. Samples often have crush artifact, which makes histologic characterization difficult. Because only mucosa is obtained, deeper inflammation or neoplasia may be missed, and it is difficult to document the presence of lymphangectasia. It is important to obtain samples even if the mucosal surface appears normal. Multiple samples should be obtained from each site. In dogs, duodenal aspirates are performed to assess for Giardia spp. and bacterial overgrowth. In cats, however, Giardia spp. reside more distally in the small bowel, and normal cats have extremely variable numbers of bacteria in the duodenum. Thus the diagnostic benefit of these tests is limited. If gastritis is suspected, samples should be collected from the cardia and placed on a urea slant to assess for the presence of urease activity, which supports the diagnosis of helicobacteriosis (see Chapter 20).If endoscopic biopsies are nondiagnostic in a cat with clinical signs of IBD and other causes of vomiting and diarrhea have been ruled out, surgical, full-thickness biopsies are warranted. Surgery has the additional benefit of allowing visualization and biopsy of the pancreas and liver in cats with suspected triaditis. Because endoscopically obtained biopsies are occasionally falsely negative, require specialized equipment, and limit testing to the mucosal surface, exploratory laparotomy may be the preferred procedure for clients with limited budgets.13.\nIn what forms does IBD occur?\nIBD is classified by the area of the GI tract that is affected and the predominant type of inflammatory cell:\nLymphocytic-plasmacytic enterocolitis is the most common type of IBD diagnosed in cats. The lamina propria is infiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells. The disease may progress to diffuse intestinal lymphoma.\nEosinophilic enterocolitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome are rare forms of IBD characterized by diffuse or focal infiltration of mature eosinophils into one or more layers of the intestinal tract. Usually they are accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia. Although eosinophilic enterocolitis is confined to the GI tract, hypereosinophilic syndrome may involve the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, lung, pancreas, adrenal glands, or skin. Hypereosinophilic syndrome responds poorly to glucocorticoids, is considered a preneoplastic condition, and has a high mortality rate.\nRegional granulomatous enterocolitis is less common. It is characterized by transmural granulomatous inflammation, usually of the ileum and colon, that causes stenosing, mass-like thickening of a region of bowel wall. Regional lymph nodes and adjacent mesentery also may be involved.Other rare forms (all treated as lymphocytic-plasmacytic IBD) include neutrophilic (suppurative) colitis, granulomatous colitis, histiocytic colitis, necrotic colitis, and angiopathic colitis with vasculitis and ischemic ulcers.14.\nHow is IBD treated?\nThe basic concepts of treatment are to remove the antigenic source of inflammation and then suppress the cell-mediated inflammatory response in the GI tract. The goals are remission of clinical signs, control with dietary management, and use of metronidazole and/or prednisolone. Relapses often occur and require drug therapy. Severe and refractory IBD may require the use of potent immunosuppressive drugs. Some cats require indefinite drug administration for control.15.\nDescribe dietary management of IBD.\nThe diet should contain a single, highly digestible, novel protein (one that the cat has not eaten before) and reduced amounts of food additives. It also should be gluten-free; use rice or potato as a carbohydrate source. High-fat diets should be avoided. If colitis is present, consider high-fiber diets containing either insoluble (cellulose) or soluble (psyllium) fiber. When a homemade diet is used for initial treatment, many cats find baby rice cereal more palatable than cooked white rice. Some people advocate a \u201csacrificial protein\u201d for the first 6 weeks of treatment, on the theory that the cat is more likely to develop dietary sensitivity during the time that the gut is inflamed. Protein hydrolysates have reduced molecular weights (< 10,000 daltons) that should decrease antigenicity.\n\n16.\nWhat dietary supplements are commonly recommended?\nVarious nutritional deficiencies secondary to IBD require supplementation. In addition, some nutritional supplements may have anti-inflammatory effects or promote healing of the intestinal tract. Controlled studies of these supplements for treatment of feline IBD are lacking.\u2022Vitamin B12 (cobalamine) and folate concentrations are often reduced by malabsorption.\u2022Vitamin K deficiency due to malabsorption of fats may be severe enough to cause bleeding and abnormal hemostasis.\u2022N-acetyl glucosamine has shown promise in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, including IBD, colitis and Crohn's disease in people.\u2022Glutamine can be supplemented as an energy source for mucosal cells of the digestive tract.\u2022Vitamin C scavenges free radicals, enhances immune function, has anti-inflammatory properties, and may reduce stress.\u2022\nLactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic that may help to restore normal intestinal flora.\u2022Dimethylglycine modulates production of lymphocytes and antibodies. It is theorized to decrease the allergic response.\u2022Proanthocyanidin complex is a bioflavinoid that theoretically works with vitamin C to reduce inflammation, strengthen capillaries, scavenge free radicals, and improve immune function. Antiviral activity also has been proposed.\u2022Vitamin E, vitamin A, and selenium are antioxidants that may protect cells from free oxygen radical-induced damage.\u2022Zinc is thought to potentiate immune system response and enhance healing.\n\n\n17.\nWhat drugs are used to manage IBD?\n\n\n18.\nDescribe the effects of metronidazole.\nThis antibiotic is one of the antiprotozoal drugs of choice for Giardia spp. in cats. Because it has an excellent anaerobic spectrum, it may aid in the treatment of secondary bacterial overgrowth. It is proposed to inhibit cell-mediated immunity and to alter neutrophil chemotaxis and thus may be an effective adjunct to glucocorticoids. Side effects include salivation (due to bad taste), anorexia, vomiting, central nervous system abnormalities (seizures), and neutropenia.19.\nDiscuss the role of glucocorticoids.\nPrednisolone is used most frequently, but if the cat cannot or will not take oral medications, methylprednisolone can be used. Control seems to be more difficult with parenteral depository glucocorticoids. Transdermal dosing of prednisolone also may be helpful when oral drugs cannot be administered. Glucocorticoids should not be prescribed until the diagnosis of IBD is confirmed by histology. Common side effects include polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, skin disease, weight gain, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (see Chapter 54).20.\nHow does azathioprine work?\nThe mechanism of immunosuppression has not been determined, but it is thought to depend on several factors. Azathioprine antagonizes purine metabolism, resulting in inhibition of RNA, DNA synthesis, and mitosis. Incorporation into nucleic acids may cause chromosome breaks, and inhibition of coenzyme function may disrupt cellular metabolism. Azathioprine has a greater effect on cellular immunity and delayed hypersensitivity than on humoral antibody responses. It is thought to take at least 1\u20133 weeks to become fully effective, and clinical response may require 6 weeks. It is used most often in cases of IBD that cannot be controlled by diet modifications and glucocorticoids or in cats that glucocorticoids make ill. Side effects may include bone marrow suppression, pancreatitis, hepatic damage, and anorexia. CBC should be monitored once or twice weekly for 10\u201314 days after starting, then monthly.21.\nWhat is the mechanism of action of sulfasalazine?\nThe mechanism of action is not known. It is thought that after colonic bacteria cleave sulfasalazine into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), the antibacterial (sulfapyridine) and anti-inflammatory (5-ASA) activity modify the course of the disease. Levels of both drugs are higher in the colon when the compound is used than with separate administration. Dosing in cats may be difficult without compounding. Primary side effects include anorexia, vomiting, and anemia; in dogs sulfasalazine has induced keratoconjunctivitis sicca.22.\nHow do cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil work?\nThe metabolites of cyclophosphamide act as alkylating agents, interfering with DNA replication, RNA transcription and replication, and nucleic acid function. The phosphorylating activity of cyclophosphamide also enhances its cytotoxic properties. The mechanism of action for its immunosuppressive activity on T-cells and antibody production is unknown. The drug is associated with bone marrow suppression and hemorrhagic cystitis (rarely). It should not be used over the long term. If it is effective during the induction phase, the related drug chlorambucil should be used for chronic management.The mechanism of action of chlorambucil is cross-linking with cellular DNA. It is cytotoxic and cell cycle-nonspecific. Side effects include myelosuppression, resulting in anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. It can also result in anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea. A complete blood count with platelets should be done weekly until the cat is stable, then every other week.23.\nDescribe the mechanism of action of cyclosporine.\nThe mechanism of action is impedance of calcium-dependent signal transduction in the cytosol of lymphocytes. Cyclosporine stimulates secretion of transforming growth factor beta, which inhibits interleukin 2-stimulated T-cell proliferation and generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. The primary side effects in people and dogs include inappetence, GI irritation, and gingival hyperplasia. Blood levels should be measured 24\u201348 hours after starting therapy to ensure adequate levels and periodically during therapy. The goal is a 12-hour whole-blood trough level of 250\u2013500 ng/ml. Gelatin capsules may be needed for administration because of the unpleasant taste.24.\nWhat is the prognosis for cats with IBD?\nThe prognosis depends on the form of IBD. In general, although the condition cannot be cured, the prognosis for control is good.\n",
