Fourteen percent to 20940 of patients require endotracheal intubation and ventilator support. Some of these pa. tients may require tracheostomy subsequently. This procedure, when performed without protection, may lead to infection of the medical and nursing staff taking care of the patient. Study Design: Based on clinical information of three patients. Methods: The authors carried out an emergency tracheostomy and changed the tracheostomy tube for one patient and performed elective tracheostomy in another two patients. Results: No medical or nursing staff member was infected after carrying out the procedure while taking all the precautions and wearing the appropriate protective appareL Conclusion: The authors have prepared guidelines for performing a safe tracheostomy under both elective and emergency conditions. Surgeons who might be involved in performing the tracheostomy should become familiar with these guidelines and the appropriate protective apparel. hryngoscope,",

The disease is a n infection caused by a coronavirus resulting in a clinical picture of atypical pneumonia.' Characteristic radiological features on chest radiograph and computed tomography scan could be found in most patients with SARS. The therapeutic regimens consist of antiviral agents such as Ribavirin and large doses of steroids.' Although most patients recover following this treatment regimen, 14% to 20% of patients develop respiratory failure and require endotracheal intubation and ventilator s~p p o r t .~.~ SARS has caused much concern because it is highly contagious and has affected countries around the world.' \"he route of infection by the virus is through the mucosal membrane and conjunctiva. The mode of spread is through direct contact with the virus, which is thought to be transported through aerosol and fine droplets. This has posed a significant threat to medical and nursing staff caring for these patients, especially when the patients are receiving ventilator support in which frequent suction of the bronchial secretions is mandatory.",

In the latter circumstance, a surgical airway has to be established as an emergency measure. Spillage of blood and bronchial secretions are expected to be significant during the tracheostomy. Protection of the medical and nursing staff is mandatory when this procedure is performed for patients with SARS or those suspected of having SARS. Medical personnel should be familiar with the guidelines, and all appropriate protective equipment should be available for immediate usage. This will reduce the risk of acquiring the infection during tracheostomy to a minimum.",

The fever persisted, and his chest radiograph showed left-side, lower zone patchy consolidation. Subsequent rapid development of respiratory tract symptoms associated with a low lymphocyte count showed that he was likely to have contracted SARS. This was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analyses of his nasal aspirate, which identified the presence of coronavirus DNA. He was managed with intravenous Ribavirin; however, his pulmonary function deteriorated on day 6 after admission. A decision was then made to carry out endotracheal intubation, which was unsuccessful. The arterial oxygen saturation level of the patient was found to have decreased to 70%. Immediate tracheostomy was required at the bedside in the intensive care unit. His preoperative blood gas values showed a partial pressure of oxygen of8.8 kPa and partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 4.2 kPa, and the patient was drowsy.",

The cricoid cartilage was quickly identified, and a vertical tracheotomy was performed by cutting the second and third cartilaginous tracheal rings.

The patient regained consciousness, and his arterial oxygen saturation level returned to 100%. His postoperative blood gas values showed a partial pressure of oxygen of 27.3 kPa and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 5.7 kPa. There was significant coughing and thus spillage of tracheal secretion during tracheotomy and when the tracheostomy tube was being inserted. On completion of the procedure, the gloves, operating gown, N95 mask, goggles, and cap were removed in this order by the surgeon to avoid crosscontaminating other medical and nursing staff.
