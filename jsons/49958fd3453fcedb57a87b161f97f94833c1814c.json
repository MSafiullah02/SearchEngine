ACE2 is a zinc metalloprotease involved in the homeostatic balance of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone axis, and is expressed in a variety of tissues including the nasopharynx, lung, and intestines, accounting for COVID-19's symptomatology of respiratory and digestive distress and diarrhea [4, 13] .

The ACE2 loss results in a pathologic increase in Angiotensin II over Angiotensin (1-7) tone systemically that leads, through their respective receptors AT1 and MAS, to complement activation, vasoconstriction, and thrombosis [16] [17] [18] . When ACE2 proteins are internalized and destroyed, or the cell hosting many such proteins are destroyed by the virus, the resultant imbalance of Angiotensin II and Angiotensin (1-7) in the blood decreases the activity of endothelial nitrous oxide J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f synthase (eNOS) [19] . eNOS , a potent down-regulator of the production of tissue factor (TF) through nitrous oxide(NO), is also a well-known vasodilator. [20] Another effect of this angiotensin subtype imbalance is increasing NOX-2 activity, which produces radical oxygen species that causes cellular damage [21] . These inflammatory radical oxygen species react with and thereby are a mechanism for disabling NO, further increasing vasoconstriction [22] . The now contracted vessels associated with higher levels of TF and concurrent cellular damage from ROS made by NOX-2 creates a microenvironment conducive for inflammation and thrombosis [23] .",

Complement deposition in major, blood-bathed organ systems can have systemic procoagulant effects. Complement activation product C3a activates platelets [26] , and C5a increases the expression and activity of the potent coagulation initiator, tissue factor (TF), in both macrophages and the endothelium [27] [28] [29] . Reciprocally, there is the ability of FXa, thrombin, and FIXa to trigger the complement cascade by acting as independent C3 and C5 convertases [29] to create a feed forward mechanism.

PAI-2 is a procoagulant suicide-inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that is unique to the placental trophoblasts and to a far lesser extent, macrophages [31] . The inhibitor to fibrinolysis is nearly undetectable before pregnancy, and rises over the gravid course [32] . PAI-2 forms dense polymers in the placenta, and may be fragmented and activated by redox potential [33, 34] , and an important connection to the previously-discussed effect of Angiotensin II predominance on NOX-2 which produces oxidizing free radicals.",
