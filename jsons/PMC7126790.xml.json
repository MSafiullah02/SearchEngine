Intravenous ribavirin, methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin were started according to our protocol for SARS. However, he had progressively deteriorating respiratory status necessitating pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone and non-invasive ventilatory support initiated on Day 3, and then was subsequently stabilized. On Day 7, he developed acute non-ST-elevated anterior myocardial infarction (MI), which responded to medical therapy. On Day 8, chest pain recurred with extensive ST-elevated MI in the same territory. Intravenous streptokinase was given. The patient had persistent symptoms and developed frequent ventricular tachycardia with hypotension. Urgent coronary angiography revealed 3-vessel disease Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n. A critical stenosis with thrombus was present in the culprit left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The right coronary artery (RCA) could not be selectively cannulated. Angioplasty and stenting was successfully performed to the left circumflex (LCx) artery and the culprit LAD artery, respectively, with symptom abolition and haemodynamic stabilization. However, sudden retrosternal pain and hypotension recurred 8 h later. ECG showed acute ST-elevated inferior MI attributable to the RCA territory. In view of the gross haemodynamic instability, and difficulty in cannulating the RCA, further intervention was not contemplated. Intravenous alteplase was administered. The patient continued to deteriorate and succumbed on the same day.",

Vascular inflammatory response, raised inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins such as fibrinogen have been linked to acute coronary syndrome and plague instability [2], [3]. Murphy et al. [4] recently demonstrated elevated markers of circulatory monocytes and endothelial activation, providing evidence that a systemic rather than local inflammation is implicated in acute coronary events. Endothelial activation and inflammation has also been shown to be associated with failure of thrombolyis in acute MI [5]. In the context of SARS, a tri-phasic clinical course has been observed: viral replication phase, immunopathological phase and phase of end-organ damage [6]. The immunopathological phase is characterized by clinical progression in respiratory distress and radiological deterioration which could be due to immune-mediated damage from excessive host response. The resultant proinflammatory cytokine \u201cstorm\u201d may have contributed to coronary plague instability and a catastrophic series of cardiac events in our patient. Acute MI did account for two of the seven deaths among 75 SARS patients in another report [6]. Physicians should be alert to potentially fatal cardiac problems in SARS and adopt vigilant and aggressive treatment strategies as appropriate.",
