Simply put, they may be new infections resulting from changes or evolution of existing organisms, known infections spreading to new geographic areas or populations, previously unrecognized infections appearing in areas undergoing ecologic transformation, or old infections reemerging because of antimicrobial resistance in known agents or breakdowns in public health measures.1, 2 Emerging infections account for at least 15% of all human pathogens according to the 10th International Conference on EID.3 A major concern is the synergistic communication between emerging diseases and other infectious and noninfectious conditions. Many emerging diseases are zoonotic or synoptic, an animal receptacle incubates the organism with random transmission into human populations. Likewise, EID may be foodborne, vector-borne, or airborne. Regardless, for an EID to become established, the infectious agent must be introduced into a vulnerable population, and the agent must have the ability to spread from human to human and cause disease.4\n",

Although they are transmissible, there is the potential for immunity against reinfection. Many are preventable through vaccines with the potential for eradication. There is interdependence on nature and human behavior.5 The challenge of EID relates to their impact on humans: pandemics, epidemics as well as the threats to human health and global stability.5, 6 It is known that the appearance of new infections is inevitable. That said, despite the advances in the development of countermeasures diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, world travel and increased global interdependence have added to problems in diagnosing and containing these diseases. Most can relate to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, severe respiratory syndrome, and pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza as emerging infections in modern day. The societal and economic impact of these diseases was phenomenal, not to mention the quality of life among infected individuals and their families. Understanding the categories of infectious diseases is important. Specific categories include those that are newly emerging, those that have become established and may periodically reemerge, and those that have become stably endemic.5, 6\n",

Consider the driving factors previously noted. The incidence of zoonoses increases when humans live in close contact with animals and when humans encounter animals in new geographic regions. Some examples include Lyme disease (spread by ticks) and salmonella (spread by poultry). One may recall recent outbreaks of Salmonella in shell eggs, chicken products, raw turkey products, and pet guinea pigs.",

Seasonal influenza viruses normally circulate in humans in lieu of birds, for example, H1N1, H3N2.20, 35 The avian influenza A (H7N2) is unique in its ability to infect humans in contact with domestic animals.35 Although the pathogenicity is low and the risk of human transmission is unlikely, the possibility of a widespread problem has to be considered. Influenza in cats spreads the same way as human flu spreads, through direct contact, air droplets, and contaminated surfaces. Germs in cat saliva may be transferred onto the cat\u2019s coat during grooming. The virus may manifest through persistent coughing, lip smacking, runny nose, and fever in cats.
