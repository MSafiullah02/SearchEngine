            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) may be considered a new powerful tool for intracellular immunization against HIV-1 infection. It has been demonstrated in short-term assays that HIV-1 replication can be inhibited by siRNAs directed against viral targets (i.e. rev) or cellular targets (i.e. CCR5).4., 97., 119., 127. As to the viral targets, siRNAs targeting conserved gag, pol, int, vpu regions21 or gp41, tat, rev or nef\n33 were shown to inhibit virus production. Although targeting single HIV-1 sequences with siRNAs can result in strong inhibition of viral replication, it is likely followed by the escape of mutated viral variants.32 Therefore, antiviral approaches involving RNAi should be used in a combined fashion so as to prevent emergence of resistant viruses.",

The latter enzymes are essential for viral RNA synthesis (through the supply of GTP) and viral mRNA maturation (through 5\u2032-capping), respectively.
