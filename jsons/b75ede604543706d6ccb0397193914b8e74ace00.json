Since 2001, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has emerged, as a respiratory pathogen that causes a significant proportion of both upper and lower RTIs in infants and children [ Van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Esper et al., 2003] .",

Few populationbased estimates of the incidence of these viruses in developing countries are available. In addition, clear data are lacking on seasonality, severity, and case-fatality rates of these viruses. The acquisition and spread of respiratory viral infections among individuals has been attributed to several risk factors such as large family size, lateness in the birth order, crowding within the home, low birth weight, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, lack of breast feeding, pollution, and youth [Weber et al., 1999] . However, these factors vary considerably among different study populations in different countries. The variations can be due to cultural and socioeconomic factors, geographical or climatic differences, or variations in health care systems. A clear understanding of the local epidemiology of the disease and identifying risk factors is critical for the successful implementation of a prevention and control program.",

Bronchiolitis was defined as a constellation of clinical symptoms and signs including a viral upper respiratory prodrome followed by increased respiratory effort and wheezing in children less than 2 years of age [American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006 ]. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of fever, acute respiratory symptoms, or both, plus evidence of parenchymal infiltrates on chest radiography [Mclntosh, 2002] . The exclusion criteria for this study were known immunosuppressive conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); cancer or chemotherapy; hematological malignancies and autoimmune disorders; chronic use of high dose systemic corticosteroids (>30 mg/day for more than 2 weeks in the preceding 4 weeks); and children with symptoms of a respiratory infection starting 7 days after hospitalization. Written consent was obtained from their parents. A detailed epidemiological questionnaire, which included information on demographics, clinical presentation, medical history, and risk factors for respiratory illnesses, was completed by the treating physician. Furthermore, research and ethics approval was sought and granted by the College of Medicine and Health Sciences Research and Ethics Committee at Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman.",

In the present study, respiratory viruses were detected in 50% of children hospitalized with symptoms and signs of acute RTIs. The leading cause of hospitalization was RSV A and B followed by adenovirus and PIV. Globally in 2005, an estimated 66,000-199,999 children younger than 5 years of age died from acute lower RTIs caused by RSV, with most of these deaths occurring in developing countries [Naira et al., 2010] . The burden of RSV in developing countries has been substantial and varies from one country to another, probably due to socioeconomic factors and health care patterns. This study demonstrates that RSV causes significant morbidity in Omani children 5 years of age with higher rates of infection than those reported from countries within the region, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Egypt [Al-Hajjar et al., 1998; Khadadah et al., 2010; Fattouh et al., 2011] . The higher detection rate can be attributed to the use of more sensitive molecularbased diagnostic assays in the current study. In a recent study by Ali et al. [2010] , the prevalence of RSV infection detected by real-time RT-PCR was 64%.",

This is attributed to the fact that December is the coldest month in Oman. Viral prevalence did not differ in the dry and rainy seasons, as the weather in Oman is mostly dry. In a study from Qatar, a country with a similar climate to Oman, respiratory viruses, particularly RSV epidemics, occurred yearly during the winter months with peak hospitalizations occurring between November and February [Wahab et al., 2001] . The seasonality of RSV infection has been well documented. In temperate climates, RSV activity peaks in the winter months but may occur throughout the year in equatorial areas [Stensballe et al., 2003; Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2010) ].

In the current study, only 20% of hospitalized infants and young children with RSV infection were premature. Several studies have shown that the majority of infants hospitalized with severe RSV disease are term infants with no underlying risk factors, and therefore are not considered candidates for palivizumab therapy. Clinical trials on several other novel treatments are ongoing.",

The obvious choice for the prevention of serious RSV infections would be the development of a vaccine. However, vaccines that have been developed against RSV are either inactivated or live-attenuated. Those that are inactivated produce high levels of serum antibody causing more severe infections than the wild virus. Those that are live-attenuated are too reactive or overly attenuated [Nair et al., 2011] . Thus the best preventive measures currently available are infection control measures and immunoprophylaxis with a monoclonal antibody for high-risk groups. Of the infection control measures employed, hand washing is the most important and the least expensive [Isaacs et al., 1991] . Other possible infection control procedures include isolation or cohorting of infected infants and improving nurse to patient ratios.",

RSV is the predominant cause of pediatric viral RTIs. For most of these viruses, treatment remains exclusively supportive. Thus, prevention remains the cornerstone of disease management. Currently, immunoprophylaxis for RSV infections is available. Guidelines published by the American Association of Pediatrics [American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009] have been adopted widely in developed countries to protect highrisk groups, but their implementation in this region has been hindered due to the high cost of the RSV monoclonal antibody and lack of epidemiological studies. The results of this study have important policy implications in the region. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need for the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies including vaccines and effective pharmacotherapy. The implementation of these strategies should remain a high priority.",
