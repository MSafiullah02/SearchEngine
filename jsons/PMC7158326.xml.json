This route may be selected for substances that are broken down in the stomach or show a rapid first pass effect. As it is technically not feasible to perform full preclinical toxicity studies by the sublingual route, conventional oral or parenteral routes are preferred for systemic toxicity studies on such compounds. The choice of the best route will to a large extent be dictated by pharmacokinetic considerations. However, it is usually deemed necessary to assess local irritancy potential to oral mucosa using a laboratory animal model.",

However, there has been an increasing awareness of dental lesions in toxicity studies, particularly as the teeth are visualized when the maxilla is examined histologically in inhalation studies. Study of the rodent dentition in inhalation studies has shown that spontaneous lesions of the dentition are quite common. In one laboratory, malformations (dental dysplasia) of the maxillary incisors were observed in 3% of female and 9% of male CD-1 mice and 14.5% of female and 10.5% of Sprague\u2013Dawley rats in 24 and 18 month inhalation studies respectively.22 Unlike in humans, the rodent incisor continues to grow and differentiate throughout life and is renewed every 40\u201350 days. Located at the centre of the tooth is the vascular pulp. This is surrounded by proliferating ondotoblasts which form predentin which when calcified becomes dentin. Surrounding ameloblasts when induced by the presence of dentin produce the overlying enamel layer. It is these active cellular layers which can be modified or damaged by drugs, vitamin deficiencies, calcium, phosphate or magnesium deficiency, parathyroidectomy, hypophysectomy, hyperparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and fluorosis.23 In the rat these odontogenic cells have been shown by immunocytochemistry to express high levels of parathyroid hormone-related peptide and its receptor.24 Studies in genetically modified mice have shown that parathyroid hormone-related peptide, a member of the parathyroid hormone family, is important in normal tooth development as well as cartilage and a number of other tissues and organs.25\n",

It has been shown that vincristine, which interferes with the assembly of microtubules and reduces secretory activity in a number of cells including osteoblasts and chondroblasts, also effects dentine formation in the rat incisor. Two weeks following a single intravenous dose of vincristine to young adult rats, a faint incremental line in the dentine was shown to occur, probably a reflection of a direct effect of the drug on the dentinogenic tissue at the time of injection.30,\n31 At higher doses, focal niche-like or punched-out defects in dentine were also observed, expression of more severe injury to highly sensitive dentinogenic populations at the time of injection. The precise mechanism of damage is not fully understood although decreased secretion of dentine matrix by odontoblasts was demonstrated. Administration of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide or a single exposure to ionizing radiation also produces localized niche-like or punched out defects in the rat incisor.32,\n33\n",

In humans, reported alterations include tooth root resorption, small teeth, delayed shedding of deciduous teeth and retarded eruption of permanent teeth, features similar to those found in hypoparathyroid or pseudohypoparathyroid conditions.34 Tooth root alterations were also reported in a study in which young male Wistar rats were treated with diphenylhyantoin for one month.35 Treated rats showed evidence of molar root resorption lacunae that penetrated the cementum and involved the dentine. The lacunae contained a dense infiltrate of cells contiguous with similar cells in the surrounding periodontal ligament. Changes were similar to those occurring in parathyroidectomized rats but not those in rats made hypocalcaemic with a calcium-deficient diet. It has therefore been suggested that the changes induced by diphenylhydantoin in rats are similar to those in pseudohypoparathyroidism in which resistance of tooth roots to resorption is reduced.35 High circulating levels of parathyroid hormone-related peptide has also been shown to disrupt ondontoblastic cell function and normal tooth growth in the rat.36\n",

They range from benign anomalies and cystic structures through to malignant neoplasms. The ameloblastoma comprises cords, nests, anastomosing strands or islands of odontogenic epithelial cells within a fibrous stroma. The tumour cells resemble ameloblasts with the cords of spindle-shaped cells similar to the stellate epithelium bounded by a peripheral layer of cuboidal or columnar cells resembling the inner enamel epithelium. Other tumours of the odontogenic epithelium show induction of the mesenchymal elements or develop a complete sequence of odontogenic epithelium, odontogenic mesenchyme and dental hard tissues including dentine, enamel and cementum. These have been classified as odontoma characterized by the presence of dental hard tissues and odontogenic fibroma composed of undifferentiated or primitive mesenchymal cells of developing dental tissue.54,\n67\n",

Secretory endpieces are composed of small or moderately sized cells with foamy cytoplasm and basophilic basal poles. The most striking feature is the presence of an additional duct segment interposed between the intercalated and striated ducts. This segment is lined by cylindrical epithelium with basal nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing secretory granules. This duct segment is termed the granular duct or granular convoluted tubule. The granules in these duct cells stain particularly well with the chromotropeaniline blue stain but also orange G and PAS.81 These granular cells are of special interest because they contain a large number of heterologous biologically active peptides including nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, renin, and kallikrinins.82, 83, 84 Epidermal growth factor is secreted in saliva and believed to promote wound healing. However, the precise physiological role of many of these peptides in salivary tissue remains uncertain. Epidermal growth factor was originally isolated from the mouse salivary gland where it was shown to produce premature eyelid opening and incisor eruption when injected into neonates. This not only led to the isolation of both epidermal growth factor but also its tyrosine kinase-active receptor.85,\n86 Testosterone, thyroxin and growth hormone have been shown to regulate the concentration of epidermal growth factor in the rat submandibular gland.84 Moreover, testosterone is responsible for the male pattern of the gland, notably the larger volume of secretory tubules and cytoplasmic granules. Castration causes their regression and androgens their hypertrophy in castrated males and intact females.87 Granular cells stain with antisera for epidermal growth factor.81 The intracellular distribution of epidermal growth factor in acini and ducts has been confirmed in other species, including humans.88\n",

Immunocytochemistry showed that most of the lymphocytes were T cells of the helper/inducer subset (CD4 positive) and less than 10% were of suppresser/cytotoxic (CD8 positive) type. Circulating anti-salivary duct antibody of IgG was also detected in afflicted mice. It was suggested that helper/inducer T cells played a key role in the production of this change, unlike induced autoimmune sialoadenitis in which cytotoxic T cell subsets may directly destroy glandular tissue. It has been suggested that this process in ageing females is related to the decline in the number of suppresser/cytotoxic T cells in mice with advancing age.106 These cells are believed to be the most susceptible to ageing.",

The cause of forestomach ulceration often remains unclear, although a variety of factors have been associated with its development including advanced age, infection, parasitism, diet, feeding regimens and stress. In rats, conflict-induced ulceration occurs in the forestomach and there is an age-related susceptibility, older rats developing more ulcers than younger rats.167 In rats and mice dying of spontaneous disease, ulceration of the forestomach is also quite frequently observed. Protein restriction or starvation has also been shown to produce forestomach ulceration in rats.168\n",

Following feeding of rats with butylated hydroxyanisole mixed in the diet, lesions tend to be located near the limiting ridge whereas gavage in corn oil produces similar changes at the apex of the forestomach.171 It has been therefore suggested that the differences are due to incomplete mixing of butylated hydroxyanisole in the stomach lumen when given by gavage and prolonged contact of the gavage mixture with the upper segment of the forestomach. Moreover, it has been shown that Fischer 344, SHR, Lewis and Sprague\u2013Dawley rats differ in their response to the hyperplastic and carcinogenic effects of 2% butylated hydroxyanisole in pelleted diet. The most sensitive appears to be the SHR strain followed by the Fischer 334 rats. The differences correlate with the cytotoxic effects of butylated hydroxyanisole in the different strains.194 The presence of vascular damage in the stomachs of the SHR rats might have contributed to the response to cytotoxicity and subsequent carcinogenicity.",

Although it has been demonstrated that butylated hydroxyanisole does not produce hyperplasia in the oesophagus of animal species without a forestomach, high doses given to primates are capable of producing an increase in mitotic activity in the lower end of the oesophagus similar to that occurring at equivalent exposure levels in the rat forestomach.195 The implication is that these interspecies differences may simply be a question of differences in exposure of the squamous mucosa to compound. This underlines the fact that mechanisms of action and exposure levels of xenobiotics attained in the gastrointestinal tract of rodent and non-rodent species as well as of humans need to be carefully assessed when hyperplasia and neoplasia are induced in the forestomach mucosa of rodents. Such information can clearly be helpful in facilitating decisions made by government's regulatory authorities in this area.196 However, in the case of butylated hydroxyanisole the evidence suggests that the tumour development in rodents represents an epigenetic phenomenon related to largely reversible cytotoxicity and increased cell proliferation.184 In view of the low levels of exposure to butylated hydroxyanisole that occur with the usual use of this agent, carcinogenic hazard for the human stomach is therefore very small.",

These glycoproteins are high molecular weight compounds with large numbers of sugar chains attached to a polypeptide backbone by O-glycosidic linkages between N-acetylgalactosamine and serine or threonine.232 The principal monosaccharides present are fucose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. Due to this extensive glycosylation, mucins have a filamentous conformation, which is often negatively charged. This is believed to be important in forming a protective barrier to the cell.

Genome sequence analysis has shown that Helicobacter pylori has well developed sequences for motility, scavenging iron and DNA restriction and modification systems used by bacteria to degrade foreign DNA. The link between Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulceration has been related to increases in gastrin release, perhaps through bacterial products or cytokines released from activated lymphocytes.252\n",

The theory that has gained widespread acceptance is that the ulcerogenic potential of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is related to their pharmacological activity. John Vane proposed that the ulcerogenic potential of these agents is largely a result of their ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase, thereby reducing the protective effects of prostaglandins.253 By inhibiting cyclooxygenase these agents not only reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines but also prostaglandin synthesis. Indeed, there is a good correlation between time and dose dependency of induced suppression of gastrointestinal prostaglandin synthesis and potential for peptic ulceration.254 Why this should lead to ulceration is less clear but it probably is a result of effects on several components of mucosal defence such as changes to the microcirculation, local irritation, impairment of repair and alterations to mucin or bicarbonate production.243,\n254\n",

Whilst the benefit of selective COX-2 inhibitors for protection of the gastrointestinal tract is generally accepted, the situation turns out to be far more complex than originally envisaged. Many different mediators have been shown to contribute to the resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to injury.243,\n255 Indeed, in some circumstances COX-2 produces a highly potent gastro-protective substance 15-R-lipoxin A4. Moreover, one of the most dramatic pharmaceutical events over recent years has been the withdrawal from the marketplace of certain of these selective COX-2 inhibitors, Vioxx\u2122 (rofecoxib) and Bextra\u2122 (valdecoxib) because of concerns over their cardiovascular safety and skin effects which have been shown in major clinical trials.256,\n257\n",

There is little that is histologically specific to drug-induced ulceration of the gastric glandular mucosa. Erosions and ulcers develop in laboratory animals following stress, reflux of intestinal contents and bile, changes in acid secretion and hypoxia, all of which may develop under the conditions occurring in high-dose toxicity studies. The requirement to give the test compound in high doses may also dictate the need to administer exceedingly high concentrations of test agent, which may simply damage the mucosa as a result of local irritancy in a manner not relevant to therapeutic doses used in clinical practice. For example it has been demonstrated that oral administration of hyperosmolar solutions of quite innocuous substances such as glucose or sodium chloride can cause gastric inflammation, haemorrhage, erosions and ulcers of the rat gastric mucosa.264,\n265 Hyperosmolar solutions of sodium chloride have also been shown to induce increased expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes of CYP1A and CYP3A subtypes in the surface and foveolar cells of the gastric mucosa of rats, which could also modify the expression of xenobiotic activity.265 The well-known association of gastric erosions and haemorrhage with uraemia may also be manifest following administration of high doses of drugs such as diuretics which severely derange fluid and electrolyte balance.11 Synergism between the ulcerogenic action of drugs and stress is also a well-described phenomenon.266,\n267 Protein depletion and starvation is also capable of inducing gastric ulceration in rats.268\n",

The powerful non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and phenylbutazone produced gastric mucosal erosion and ulcers as well as small intestinal damage. However, novel targeted therapies for treatment of cancer may not fall into these simple categories. For example a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor which produced single cell necrosis in the intestine in treated rats, also produced cell damage (apoptosis) in the gastric glands of the fundus and pyloric regions most markedly in the basal zones and isthmus regions.270\n",

This damage was associated with transient faecal blood loss. By contrast, indomethacin and ibuprofen produced both gastric damage and circumscribed, penetrating ulcers along the mesenteric border of the jejunum and ileum. Furthermore, ulcers were still present after 2 weeks and were associated with prolonged or biphasic blood loss. Pharmacokinetic factors may also be important.

For example, rats, dogs and mice all developed gastric or pyloric ulceration when treated with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, although the distal small intestine seemed to be more markedly affected.283 Interestingly, it has also been shown by immunocytochemistry that the distribution of COX-2 expression in interstitial cells (monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells) of the lamina propria predominates in the distal ileum which has led to the suggestion that this might be a factor in the greater sensitivity of the ileum than the stomach to the ulcerogenic effects of COX-2 inhibition.284\n",

This is perhaps analogous to the well-known association of gastrointestinal tract erosion and haemorrhage with uraemia. Dogs appear to have a particular predisposition to this effect. Microscopic examination may show that this form of ulceration is associated with deposition of basophilic ground substance and mineral in connective tissues and blood vessels in the mucosa.286 The vascular damage which may occur in laboratory animals treated with high doses of cardioactive drugs such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also occur in intramucosal blood vessels of the stomach and the inflammatory process can spill over into the glandular mucosa.\u201d",

Incomplete forms are more heterogeneous characterized by goblet and mucous columnar cells but no absorptive cells and variable patterns of mucin. The routine alcian blue stain performed at pH 2.5 and periodic acid\u2013Schiff stain distinguishes the intestinal acid mucins (blue) from the neutral mucins of gastric type. However, variable sialomucin and sulphomucin staining patterns are also seen in intestinal metaplasia in humans if staining with the high iron-diamine/alcian blue stain is performed. The incomplete form of intestinal metaplasia, showing marked sulphomucin secretion, has been found more commonly in association with gastric cancer in people.239,\n300,\n302 However, it is probable that intestinal metaplasia itself represents an adaptive response to long-standing chronic inflammation and reduced acid secretion. It has also been suggested that it represents an adaptive defensive response to long-standing Helicobacter pylori infection because intestinal mucosa is more resistant to these organisms.304,\n305 Immunocytochemical study has shown the presence of intestinal endocrine cells in the various forms of intestinal metaplasia that appears to follow the phenotype of the particular mucous cell differentiation.303\n",

In view of the different cell populations in the gastric mucosa and the variety of morphological alterations that occur, it is difficult to make a clear distinction between hypertrophy and hyperplasia without morphometric techniques. These techniques have shown that hypertrophy of some mucosal cells can coexist with hyperplasia of other gastric cell populations. A distinction also needs to be made between diffuse or uniform hyperplasia involving one or more of the cell populations from the hyperplasia associated with focal proliferative or \u2018adenomatous\u2019 overgrowth. Adenomatous hyperplasia also needs to be evaluated for atypical cytological features (dysplasia), which are linked to development of gastric carcinoma (see below).",

Therefore, these lesions produced by tiotidine possessed more in common with those induced by powerful carcinogens such as N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine than the benign, species-specific proliferative change of little or no relevance for human safety. Interestingly, mice treated for 18 months with tiotidine were devoid of dysplastic changes in the gastric mucosa.",

An example of this was the proposal that a few gastric cancers found in patients whilst being treated with the histamine H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine were the result of treatment.393, 394, 395 It now seems likely that all those observed cancers associated with cimetidine were incidental.396 However, at that time concerns were increased by the theoretical possibility that cimetidine has the potential be nitrosated in vivo.\n393 A further factor was the concept that the treatment-induced gastric secretory inhibition with subsequent bacterial colonization of the stomach rendered the conditions conducive to the generation of N-nitroso compounds from normal dietary constituents.394,\n396 All these concerns appear to be unfounded. Long term surveillance studies with cimetidine have shown no causal link between its clinical usage and gastric malignancy.397,\n398 In addition, carcinogenicity bioassays performed with cimetidine, cimetidine plus nitrite and nitrosocimetidine have not shown any tumorigenic effect in the gastric mucosa.399 A 7 year study in dogs in which multiple gastric biopsies were taken at intervals of approximately 6 months has also shown no indication of gastric hyperplasia, dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia or neoplastic change.400 Although complacency is certainly not warranted with respect to the nitrosation of therapeutic agents in vivo, the risks of development of gastric malignancy from such drugs when administered on a short term basis are probably very small.401 Even for gastric antisecretory agents administered for longer periods of time, the balanced view would also permit development of novel agents provided they are not obviously mutagenic or carcinogenic in the usual preclinical studies and are not particularly liable to undergo rapid nitrosation.",

They are characterized by the presence of a striated or brush border which is seen in haematoxylin and eosin stained sections as a refractive bi-laminar band. The inner, wider lamina corresponds to the microvillous region that is associated with the presence of neutral mucins in most species. The outer, thinner band corresponds to the glycocalyx, which is composed principally of acidic mucosubstances.229 This outer band of the brush border shows histochemical staining predominantly for sulphomucins in most species including mouse, hamster, dog and rhesus monkey, although in the duodenum of the rats and in the entire human small bowel sialomucins predominate in this layer. Electron microscopy of the absorptive cells shows that the surface of absorptive cells is covered by tightly packed and well-developed microvilli approximately 1 \u03bcm long and 0.1 \u03bcm wide. These are considered the first site of entry of food substances into the cell.",

Particular care is needed in fixation and staining for optimal demonstration of Paneth cells for they rapidly degranulate after death and granules are destroyed by acetic acid fixation. Formalin and mercuric fixatives appear appropriate methods and they permit staining with methylene blue, Lendrum's phloxine-tartrazine and Masson's trichrome.425 The apical parts of Paneth cells show glucose-6-phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase and monoamine oxidase activity and they have been shown to contain lysozyme and immunoglobulins, particularly IgA.423,\n426, 427, 428 The Paneth cell granules also contain antimicrobial peptides such as secretory phospholipid A2, \u03b1 defensins also called cryptins.

This contrasts with the uptake of soluble antigens, which can be taken up by ordinary epithelial cells and transported in the circulation of the villi to be ultimately trapped in the spleen possibly to evoke an IgM/IgG response.449 Understanding of these cellular and molecular characteristics is critical for the design of mucosal vaccines for pathogens that exploit this pathway.451\n",

These differences result in poor preservation of mast cells of the gut if the usual metachromatic staining techniques are employed for the demonstration of mast cells in tissue sections.453 Histochemical study suggests that mucosal mast cells differ from connective tissue mast cells by a lower degree of sulphation of glycosaminoglycans and different spatial relationships of protein and glycosaminoglycans in their granules. These cross link following formalin fixation in a way that is sufficient to prohibit cationic dye binding.

Antimitotic or radiomimetic agents as well as ionizing radiation are liable to adversely affect the rapidly dividing cells of the small intestine with resulting breakdown of the mucosal barrier. The ulcerogenic activity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also be expressed in the small bowel mucosa. Moreover, different agents also act in synergy to enhance damage to the small bowel mucosa. An important example is the effect of drugs that depress the immune system and permit the development of pathological infections by microorganisms of the opportunistic type in the small intestine. Vasconstriction may also result in intestinal ulceration. For example life-threatening gastrointestinal ulceration is reported as a result of cocaine abuse. Although gastrointestinal complications are less common than cardiac damage, cocaine abuse may induce mesenteric ischaemia as a result of vasoconstriction leading to gastric or intestinal ulceration and perforation of the entire wall.456,\n457 It appears that the abuse of the free base form of cocaine (crack) is more liable to produce more upper gastrointestinal intestinal damage than oral cocaine abuse which tends to induce more distal intestinal perforation. Although the exact mechanism leading to intestinal ischaemia is not certain, cocaine blocks the reuptake of noradrenalin which is believed to be the cause of mesenteric vasoconstriction and ischaemia.",

Similar histological findings have been reported in dogs infected with this organism.468 The organisms are gram-negative curved, slender rods, which can be visualized in tissue sections with the Warthin\u2013Starry stain, a recognized technique for spiral bacteria.

This organism was first recognized in the gastric glands of mice by Tyzzer in 1907 and has since been confirmed as a cause of diarrhoea in animals and as a human pathogen. It causes mild diarrhoea in normal subjects especially children and young adults but it can produce severe intestinal disease in immunocompromised individuals.476 Histological examination of the small intestine of laboratory animals infested by Cryptosporidium reveals the presence of organisms attached to the mucosal surface, often associated, as in humans, with other parasites or infections. They are rounded, weakly basophilic structures 1\u20134 \u03bcm diameter in haematoxylin and eosin stained sections but are strongly basophilic following Romanowsky staining. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the detailed internal structure of Cryptosporidium attached to the microvillous surface of the epithelial cells. The various stages in the life cycle have been visualized by light and electron microscopy. Infection starts with ingestion of an oocyst containing four sporozoites, which are probably released by the action of digestive enzymes. These attach themselves to the intestinal mucosa and undertake their life cycle attached to the epithelial cells. These organisms have been demonstrated in most laboratory species including mice, hamsters, rabbits, dogs and monkeys.459,\n477, 478, 479, 480\n",

Ulcers in the jejunum and ileum reached a maximum area at 48\u201372 hours after dosing, occurred on the mesenteric border, penetrated through the muscularis mucosa and were accompanied by inflammation and oedema. Ulcers were still present 2 weeks later. In dogs, indomethacin given orally in doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day for one to 23 days was also shown to produce deep, punched-out ulcers in the small intestine, many of which were situated over Peyer's patches.490 Some ulcers involved the whole circumference of the small intestine wall. Histologically, the ulcers were associated with an intense inflammatory response, principally of mononuclear cells, which infiltrated the bowel wall down to the serosa particularly adjacent to Peyer's patches. It was suggested that this distribution of ulcers was a result of an exaggerated immune response to normal intestinal antigens following depression of prostaglandin synthetase by indomethacin.",

Although these different agents influence gastric acid secretion in different ways, structure\u2013activity relationships suggest that they produce duodenal dysmotility, decrease bicarbonate production and reduce its delivery from the distal to proximal duodenum. These factors decrease the neutralization of gastric acid in the first part of the duodenum which may contribute to the development of ulceration.508 Furthermore, these effects can be attenuated or prevented by dopamine agonists or their precursors whereas dopamine antagonists can potentiate their effects suggesting dopamine-mediated actions of these agents may be involved in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration.509,\n510\n",

Ultrastructural examination revealed uniform electron-lucent droplets within profiles of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Lipid droplets increased with time and accumulated to form large droplets in the lamina propria. Larger droplets were phagocytosed by macrophages in the lamina propria but there was no evidence of epithelial damage or necrosis. Changes were most pronounced in the duodenum but were also noted to a lesser extent in jejunum and ileum but not in colon or stomach. Sequential studies using electron microscopy showed that lipid rapidly accumulated within several hours in the profiles of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of the epithelial cells and formed droplets or chylomicra in the intercellular space. The absence of any other subcellular changes or evidence of derangement of protein synthesis suggested that Sa H51-055 altered the pathways of lipid resynthesis or transport. This was consistent with the distribution of the lipid in the upper third of the jejunal villous epithelium, a zone reported to be most active in lipid absorption, resynthesis and transport.512 It was suggested fatty change might have taken place because of alterations in the sugar moiety of chylomicra brought about by interference with glucose transport.",

This form of lipid storage disorder is produced by diverse amphiphilic cationic drugs in laboratory animals and occasionally in patients usually as a result of drug interaction with polar lipids rendering them difficult to digest (see Respiratory Tract, Chapter 6). Species differences in susceptibility and tissue distribution of phospholipid are probably of diverse origin. They are not only related to physiochemical characteristics of the inducing drugs which influence their ability to permeate selective biomembranes and react with different lipids but also to local tissue concentrations of drugs and the ability of particular organs to metabolize parent drug to less amphiphilic products. In general terms, this disorder is characterized by membrane-bound, acid phosphatase-positive cytoplasmic inclusions, which on ultrastructural study are seen as lamellated or crystalloid structures in lysosomes. These appearances are characteristically reversible on cessation of treatment with the inciting agent.",

After high doses of amiodarone were administered orally to rats and beagle dogs, multilamellated lysosomal inclusion bodies accumulated first in the jejunal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes before becoming widely distributed in other organs, particularly in the lungs.517 In both rats and dogs the small intestinal lesions were characterized by the presence of foamy macrophages with pale finely vacuolated cytoplasm and condensed eccentric nuclei within the lamina propria of the jejunal villi. Mesenteric lymph nodes were also involved early after the onset of treatment. In the dog, jejunal villi were somewhat flattened and widened or showed a variable degree of villous atrophy, most marked in the proximal and middle jejunum.518 Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of lamellated lysosomal bodies distending macrophages.",

DNA/RNA ratios remain largely unaltered.414 No gross changes in villous shape have been reported after resection and the total number of crypts remains constant. Although increased intestinal uptake of substances from the bowel lumen occurs in hypertrophied segments per unit length of bowel, disaccharide and dipeptidase activities are normal or even decreased after resection, suggesting a comparative immaturity of cells in the residual mucosa. Functional adaptation therefore is largely achieved by a larger number of cells but their individual absorptive capacity is not increased.414 Increased numbers of specific goblet cell populations are also seen in hyperfunctional states. Following jejuno-ileal bypass operations in rats, increased numbers of PAS-positive goblet cells develop in the villi and crypts of the hyperfunctional segments of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum.531 Mucin histochemistry has shown that the goblet cells in the hyperfunctional segments contain increased sialomucins in the villi and crypts of the jejunum and ileum but not in the duodenum and increased sulphomucins in the distal ileal segment. As sialic acid conveys more viscoelastic properties to mucin, it has been suggested that the goblet cell change following intestinal bypass fulfils a protective function against the increased flow of gastrointestinal contents.531\n",

Carefully controlled studies in rats given different forms of dietary fibre have shown that the proliferative characteristics of the small intestine can be modified by both the quantity and the quality of the fibre. These different effects may be the result of differences in solubility, gel formation, water holding capacity, effect on transit time and ion exchange activity or bile acid adsorption of the different fibres. However, interactions between dietary constituents are complex. For instance, the histological effects in the rat small intestine after administration of 2% dietary cholestyramine, a non-absorbable ion exchange resin, has been shown to depend on interaction with other dietary factors.532\n",

Histological examination and morphometric analysis revealed an increase in smooth muscle mass, lengthening of the villi as well as an increase in the depth and cellular proliferation in the crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn without evidence of cell damage or fatty change. Like the changes following jejunal bypass procedures, there was also an increase in acid mucosubstances in the goblet cell population overlying the villous mucosa. The mechanism for this change in the rat was unclear, particularly as intestinal hyperplasia was not seen in baboons treated with this 15-ketosterol for long periods. However, it was suggested that it was an adaptive response, possibly related to inhibition of cholesterol metabolism and cholesterol absorption from the diet as the laboratory diet employed in the rat study was particularly low in cholesterol.",

The changes are marked up to 30 days following surgery but less pronounced after 72 days. It has also been shown that a significant increase in the mitotic index in the proximal segment occurs at seven days but by 14 days the mitotic index returns to normal. The distal, downstream segment shows little or no morphological change but rather a long-lived increase in mitotic activity. It was suggested that these differences were related to the different embryological origin of the segments.611\n",

Oral administration of a wide range of compounds such as raw and chemically modified starches, various dietary fibres, caramels, sugar alcohols (lactitol, sorbitol, mannitol, xylilol), lactose, a synthetic polydextrose, polyethylene glycol and magnesium sulphate to rats or hamsters has also been linked to an increase caecal size and colonic mucosal hyperplasia.612, 613, 614, 615 The characteristic histological appearance of the caecum following administration of these agents is lengthening of the mucosal glands which are lined by epithelium composed of increased numbers of enlarged epithelial cells (i.e. hypertrophy and hyperplasia) showing increased proliferative activity and more rapid incorporation of tritiated thymidine. In addition, mucosal and submucosal oedema has been reported in association with the administration of lactose and increased mucosal lymphoid aggregates following lactose or xylitol feeding. Morphometric analysis has shown that changes to the mucosa depend on the fibre type.615 There may also be an interaction between dietary fibre content and colonic microflora that influences mucosal growth, although the mechanism is unclear.616 As the increase in caecal size and mucosal hypertrophy appears generally related to the osmotic activity of the caecal contents in rodents treated with these agents, it has been postulated that the changes represent a physiological adaptation to increased osmotic forces, irrespective of the contributing compounds.612\n",
