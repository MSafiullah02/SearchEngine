            "text": "Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, killing about 610,000 people per year.1,2 Many scientists around the world are studying different approaches to induce cardiac regeneration in hope to unravel new treatments that can improve cardiac function post-ischemic injury. Genetic medicine is one of the avenues of research to treat a failing heart post-myocardial infarction (MI).3 In this research, we aimed to adjust gene expression in the heart using viral vectors, small molecules, or an RNA-based approach to promote cardiac protection and cardiovascular or cardiac regeneration in ischemic cardiac disease. Modified messenger RNA (modRNA) is a novel gene therapy platform that can be used to alter the levels of proteins in mammalian cells and tissues4,5 and to treat heart diseases.6, 7, 8 The concept of therapeutically altering mRNA expression has great potential in the treatment of human diseases.9 To date, several therapeutic approaches using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and antisense oligonucleotides have been successfully tested to reduce mRNA levels in the cells.10,11 Yet, the upregulation of proteins in tissues is challenging, mostly to the high amount of mRNA needed to treat human tissue. The supply of a large amount of mRNA in vivo can subsequently elicit a higher immune response. Preclinical studies with modRNA showed that due to the transient expression of modRNA (gene expression return to baseline is a few days), modRNA will be needed, both in direct or intravenous delivery methods, to be redelivered to achieve higher gene expression.6,12, 13, 14, 15",

In total, we detected 14,552 genes and 2,397 proteins in our samples. With the comparison of the two datasets, we found 2,272 genes with corresponding proteins. Out of all genes with corresponding proteins, 239 genes and 120 proteins were differentially expressed (q value < 0.05), 4 h post-MI. 24 h post-MI, 1,702 genes and 272 proteins were differentially expressed. Hierarchical clustering dendrogram of gene expression (Figures 1B and S1A) and protein levels (Figure 1C) shows that in both cases, the experimental groups are clustered together, demonstrating significant differences in the transcriptome and proteome post-MI. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between changes in gene expression and protein expression, both 4 h post-MI (r squared = 0.02; Figure 1D) and 24 h post-MI (r squared = 0.13; Figure 1E). Whereas we found a significant correlation between the changes in gene expression and protein levels in the ischemic heart post-MI and in our search for a 5\u2032 UTR element that may elevate translation of modRNA in the heart post-MI, we were interested in identifying genes with a significant noncorrelation relationship between mRNA and protein expression. Therefore, we screened for genes that encode for proteins with elevated levels in 4 or 24 h post-MI (fold change > 2) and mRNA downregulated at 4 or 24 h post-MI (fold change < 0.64) and 5\u2032 UTR shorter than 100 bp. We were able to identify 3 genes in 4 h (Figure 1F) and 18 genes in 24 h (Figure 1G) that displayed high protein expression accompanied with lower or unchanged mRNA level, 24 h post-MI, compared to sham hearts. We identify 5 genes (gelsolin [Gsn], pregnancy-zone protein [Pzp], Serpina, fructosamine 3 kinase [Fn3k], and carboxylesterase 1D [Ces1d], marked in yellow, in Figures 1F and 1G) that had the shortest 5\u2032 UTR among those 19 genes (as FERM domain containing 5 [Frmd5] and Serpina 1b are present in both our 4- and 24-h screen results), with an upregulated protein expression not related to their mRNA expression post-MI. In addition, we validate Ces1d expression results using qPCR and western blot, showing similar mRNA and protein expression as evaluated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomic analysis (Figures S1B\u2013S1D).",

However, in comparison to the Luc-Control, Gsn, Pzp, Serpina, and Fn3k had significantly lower translation, except Luc modRNA carrying 5\u2032 UTR of Ces1d (Luc-Ces1d), which showed a significant increase of 23% in modRNA translation in comparison to Luc-Control (Figure 2C). To evaluate that this result is not due to different transfection efficiency, a parallel in vitro experiment was done with cotransfection of firefly Luc modRNA carrying different 5\u2032 UTR modRNAs and renilla Luc modRNA as an internal control that carries control 5\u2032 UTR in neonatal rat CMs. 24 h post-transfection, we used IVIS system to measure simultaneously the translation of the two different luciferase (firefly and renilla) modRNA in vitro (Figure S2). Our results show, similar to Figure 2, that Ces1d modRNA gave significantly higher firefly Luc modRNA translation with comparison to firefly Luc-Control modRNA, without significant change in renilla Luc modRNA translation. These results indicate that the high translation is due to the use of Ces1d 5\u2032 UTR and not due to different transfection efficiency.",

Interestingly, 4 out of the 5 elements (elements B, C, D, and E) were conserved among species (Figure 5A). Based on this information, we designed a Luc modRNA construct carrying different 5\u2032 UTR elements of Ces1d (elements A\u2013E) and compared its translation ability in neonatal rat CM to Luc-Ces1d (Figures 5B and 5C). Our results indicated a significant reduction in translation ability in elements A, B, C, and E but not in D (Figure 5C). We hypothesized that element D is the RNA element that is responsible for the higher translation ability of Luc-Ces1d. To test our hypothesis, we compared in an ischemic heart model the expression of Luc-Ces1d or Luc-element D with Luc-Control over 3 days (Figure 5D). Our results show that Luc modRNA, carrying 5\u2032 UTR of Ces1d or element D, has higher translation in comparison to Luc-Control (Figure 5E). Intriguingly, element D alone had a significantly higher translation in the heart at day 3 post-MI (Figure 5D). Overall, with the combination of the 3-day readout, Luc-element D has a 2.5-fold higher translation in the heart post-MI in comparison to the widely used artificial 5\u2032 UTR (Luc-Control). However, Luc-element D failed to increase translation over Luc-Ces1d in liver ischemic injury (Figures S4A and S4B) and over Luc-Ces1d or Luc-Control in heart nonischemic injury (Figures S5A and S5B).",

            "text": "The use of modRNA as a gene-delivery tool is growing in the field of therapeutic medicine. Our laboratory aims to use modRNA to induce cardiac protection and cardiovascular or cardiac regeneration post-myocardial infarction.8 Zangi et al.6 have shown that immediate delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A modRNA in a MI mouse model led to induction of cardiovascular regeneration. A follow-up study in large animals shows a significant improvement of cardiac function when VEGF-A modRNA was delivered 1 week post-MI.40 Recently, it was shown that intradermal delivery of VEGF-A modRNA in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes is safe and may promote angiogenesis.41 VEGF-A modRNA has now been evaluated in phase 2a human clinical trials to improve cardiac function in heart-failure patients. In parallel, other groups are using the modRNA platform in preclinical studies of different liver diseases to deliver different target genes. The different liver disease models that have been used are for factor IX deficiency hemophilia B,42 acute intermittent porphyria,43 glycogen storage disease type 1A,44 thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,45 alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,46 Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1,47 and urea cycle disorder48 with target genes of FIX, PBGD, glucose-6-phosphatase, ADAMTS13, SERPINA1, bilirubin-UGT, and ornithine transcarbamoylase, respectively. As was described above, both the heart and liver disease have been heavily studied in search for new treatments. One of the obstacles in moving to large animals and clinical trials is the need for a large amount of modRNA to transfect human or large-animal heart and liver. In addition, due to the short expression of modRNA, there might be a need to deliver the modRNA several times. In order to reduce the need for a large amount of modRNA for delivery, we aim to improve modRNA translation so the amount of protein that has been received from the same amount of modRNA will be higher.",

            "text": "In this particular work, we focused on the 5\u2032 UTR of Ces1d (Figures 2, 3, and 4) as an enhancer of modRNA translation in cardiac and hepatic ischemic conditions. Ces1d belongs to a family of carboxylesterases that have important roles in lipid metabolism, and they hydrolyze endogenous esters and thioesters. Carboxylesterases are known for involvement in the detoxification of environmental toxicants, as well as the prodrug metabolism. Ces1d is the functional mouse ortholog of human CES1 and has similar protein-expression profiles at different cells or tissues as CES1. Several roles of Ces1d have been reported to be directly associated with lipid metabolism.62, 63, 64 As lipid metabolism is an important process for normal heart function, fatty acids are the preferred substrates under aerobic conditions.65 As Ces1d association with lipid metabolism and as MI lead to alteration of the lipid metabolism, we hypothesize that Ces1d mRNA has been triggered by the ischemic condition in the heart post-MI, which leads it to translate better. We showed that element D is the RNA element in Ces1d that is responsible for the elevation in mRNA translation post-MI (Figure 4). It will be interesting to evaluate the element D and Ces1d in different ischemic conditions and different organs bedsides the heart, liver, and kidney. The fact that Ces1d gave higher translation in the ischemic heart and liver but not the kidney is interesting, as all three organs primarily use fatty acid oxidation for energy. This may indicate that each organ and physiological condition will need a separate evaluation using a similar approach as ours.",

One-half of the ischemic heart was sequenced for transcriptomic analysis (n = 10 total, Sham n = 3, 4 h post-MI n = 3, or 24 h post-MI n = 4), whereas the other one-half of the ischemic heart was evaluated for protein level using mass spectrometry (n = 12 total, Sham n = 4, 4 h post-MI n = 4, or 24 h post-MI n = 4). (B and C) Hierarchical clustering dendrogram of 2,272 genes with corresponding mRNA level (B) or 2,397 protein intensity (C) in Sham, 4 h post-MI or 24 h post-MI hearts. (D and E) Correlation analysis between changes in levels of proteins and mRNA in the LV, 4 (D) or 24 (E) h post-MI. The bottom-right shaded rectangles include genes that show static or reduced mRNA levels post-MI, whereas their encoded protein levels increased with comparison to sham. (F and G) A list of genes that encode for proteins with elevated protein levels (fold change > 2), while showing mRNA downregulated (fold change < 0.64), 4 h (F) or 24 h (G) post-MI. Genes with yellow backgrounds have a 5\u2032 UTR that is shorter than 100 base pairs (see Table S1 for the full sequences of the 5\u2032 UTR of the 5 genes).",
