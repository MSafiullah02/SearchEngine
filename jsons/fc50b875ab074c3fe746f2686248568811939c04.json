While it has brought nearly half the world to a standstill it has affected the financial markets in unseen ways by eroding a quarter of wealth in nearly a month. This paper investigates the reaction of financial markets globally in terms of their decline and volatility as Coronavirus epicentre moved from China to Europe and then to the US. Findings suggest that the earlier epicentre China has stabilised while the global markets have gone into a freefall especially in the later phase of the spread. Even the relatively safer commodities have suffered as the pandemic moves into the US.",

By dividing our sample into two parameters, firstly, Epidemic (Dec 2019 to March 10, 2020) and Pandemic (-post-March 10, 2020 2 ) and secondly, on the global spread, Phase 1, where coronavirus deaths were limited to China; Phase 2, European Spread and Phase 3, North American Spread, we have interesting findings. We find that Chinese markets displayed relative calm with lower volatility during both epidemic and pandemic period which negates the recent work of Zhenghui and Junhao (2019) , who argue that Chinese markets are more susceptible to uncertainty shocks emanating from China. On the other hand, the average volatility of stock markets in the US, UK, Germany and South Korea increased as Coronavirus moved from epidemic to pandemic stage. Secondly, the European indices showed the highest volatility in the US phase even though the European phase (Phase II) has recorded a higher fatality rate. These findings conform to studies of Antonakakis et al. (2013) , Chen and Chiang (2020) and Tiwari et. al. (2019) , who have studied the impact of economic uncertainty on financial market volatility.",

Table 2 highlights that the global markets uncertainty increased with the shift to the pandemic stage (11 th March 2020 onwards). The equity market declines amplified in pandemic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof stage, evident from higher negative returns. European markets registered higher negative returns as compared to other markets. This may be attributed to higher media coverage in the pandemic period leading to negative sentiments which caused markets to decline and volatility to rise (Engelberg and Parsons, 2011; Peress, 2014, and Donadelli, 2015) . Another possible reason for this sudden fall could be that most of the European countries announced lockdown around the start of the pandemic phase 4 resulting in a shut down of almost all the economic activities which is bound to affect the markets. Another important point to note is that the Chinese market showed a lower decline in retains and remained stable. This could be attributed to the hopes supported by the government's claims that the Coronavirus outbreak is under control in China itself, and the anticipation of further easing measures in fiscal policy to support the economy. Following equity markets, debt-based securities in our sample showed higher levels of volatility in the pandemic period as compared to the epidemic period. As far as commodities are concerned, Bitcoin started to show its inherent weakness during a tough financial condition during the pandemic period and registered the biggest average negative return of -3.66% in the pandemic period. Gold which remained reasonably less volatile in epidemic period started showing a decline in returns during pandemic period but in terms of volatility, it is found to be the least volatile supporting the notion of \"Gold a safe-haven asset\" (Reboredo, 2013) . where they imposed lockdown during phase 3 instead of phase 2, which is considered as one of the main reasons for Coronavirus spread in the continent (Sohrabi et al., 2020) . In terms of the regional indices (figure 1), Asia recorded the lowest volatility while the EU regional index showed the highest volatility during the US phase. For Bitcoin, the larger negative returns in Phase 2 and 3, suggest a contagion effect with equity markets during financial turmoil. Similar to our earlier discussion, Chinese stock markets and Gold remained less volatile in the US phase.",
