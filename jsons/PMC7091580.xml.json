            "text": "The survival of patients with recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer is poor. Despite the recent introduction of new cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies, less than 10% of patients are alive at 5 years.1, 2, 3 New approaches are needed to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Oncolytic viruses have been engineered to exploit mutations in malignant cells and can destroy tumors by cytolytic and immune-based mechanisms that are distinct from the cytotoxic mechanisms of chemotherapeutic agents.4, 5, 6 Onyx-015 is the prototype for this class of therapeutic agents. In this viral vector, the E1b-55K gene, which is essential for efficient viral replication, has been deleted.5, 7, 8 The E1b-55K gene product binds and inactivates p53, thereby overcoming p53-mediated checkpoint arrest and apoptosis that would limit viral replication. As E1b-55K binds and inactivates p53, it was hypothesized that this gene would be unnecessary for efficient viral replication in tumor cells with inactivating mutations in p53 or the p53 pathway.7, 8 The tumor selectivity of this oncolytic strategy is based on the premise that viral replication and lysis of cells would occur in cells with aberrant p53 but not in cells with wild-type p53. Whereas the mechanism of tumor-selective viral replication is controversial, Onyx-015 has shown promise in Phases I and II clinical trials.9, 10, 11, 12 Viral replication was observed in the tumor cells from patients with head and neck cancer and necrosis of the tumor was demonstrated following direct intratumoral injection.13, 14, 15",

As in the head and neck studies, there was evidence of viral replication, tumor necrosis and clinical benefit.12 Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the blood was performed following administration of Onyx-015 and the input virus became undetectable within 6 h after the infusion. Nevertheless, half of the patients treated at doses of \u2a7e2 \u00d7 1011 particles had a secondary peak of detectable virus in the blood starting 3\u20135 days post-infusion that lasted for up to 10 days after the infusion.12 Despite evidence of ongoing replication of Onyx-015, there were no clinical symptoms of infection of normal tissues such as cough, conjunctivitis or diarrhea; however, necrosis of tumor masses was demonstrated radiographically.12, 17 Taken together, these findings are consistent with tumor-selective replication of Onyx-015.",

Because of the biphasic response curve, patients with clinical benefit as shown by prolonged survival, were not classified as responders by standard radiographic response criteria. By radiographic response criteria, the transient enlargement in many patients would be considered progressive disease. In fact, in the early period of the trial patients were removed for presumed disease progression before the transient nature of the tumor enlargement was appreciated. Partial responses are defined radiographically as >50% reduction in the greatest diameter of the tumor. However, because of extensive necrosis and delayed resolution of these masses, partial responses were not achieved during the period of the study among patients that nevertheless benefited from treatment. The median survival of patients with transient enlargement of the tumors was 19 months. In contrast, the median survival for patients not demonstrating this response was only 6 months and was consistent with the expected survival of 4\u20136 months for patients who have failed one or more prior therapies. Based on the clinical benefit observed among the patients on this study, additional clinical trials of oncolytic adenoviral vectors are warranted.",

These systems rely primarily on human tumor xenograft models in immunodeficient mice. In these rodent models, adenovirus constructs were rapidly cleared from the systemic circulation primarily by the liver and spleen,25 and liver toxicity was the predominant dose-limiting toxicity.26, 27 The cause of hepatic toxicity includes both direct viral effects and immune-mediated effects. The direct cyctotoxic effects of adenovirus are due to viral replication, inhibition of host protein synthesis, expression of the adenoviral death protein (ADP) and ultimately lysis of the infected cell.28, 29, 30, 31 Immune-mediated mechanisms of hepatic toxicity include the induction of inflammatory cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which can cause transient increases in transaminase levels. Some adenoviral proteins are also highly immunogenic, resulting in immune-mediated destruction of infected cells. However, genes encoded in the adenoviral E3 region prevent T-cell recognition and block TNF-mediated killing of infected cells.32, 33, 34, 35, 36 Injection of mice with adenoviral vectors with deletions of the E3 region permitted immune recognition of infected cells but limited the expression of transgenes and increased immune-mediated hepatoxicity.37",

Immune-mediated hepatitis would be expected to result in increased hepatic toxicity after repeated viral exposures. Finally, in patients with cancer, we demonstrated that transient enlargement of tumor masses occurs in the first few weeks after treatment with Onyx-015.17, 23 Enlargement of the tumor masses could cause increased intrahepatic pressure resulting in bile duct obstruction and a rise in blood levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

The increase in AST and ALT was observed in the first 12\u201318 h following the infusion and resolved by 48\u201372 h after the infusion. No significant increase in total or direct bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase was observed following the four viral treatments in this patient, indicating that no significant biliary obstruction occurred in this patient. Transient, early increases in AST and ALT levels without a concurrent increase in alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin levels are consistent with a cytokine-mediated response.",

The transient increase in unconjugated bilirubin is consistent with transient hepatic dysfunction rather than obstruction as the cause of the increased bilirubin.

We have also found that AST and ALT levels are significantly increased in mice plasma following systemic delivery of even low doses of adenovirus (data not shown). However, only limited hepatic toxicity was observed in a small subset of the patients on this trial following intrahepatic viral delivery. These results suggest that the metabolism of adenovirus may differ between mice and humans. Therefore, the replication of adenovirus was evaluated in both normal and malignant hepatocytes in culture (Figure 6). Cells were infected with one viral particle per cell of Ad5 and viral replication was determined after 72 h in culture. No viral replication was observed in the normal hepatocytes, whereas viral replication proceeded effectively in malignant hepatocytes, colorectal carcinoma and normal bronchial epithelial cells. These results are consistent with our clinical findings of minimal hepatic toxicity despite the administration of up to 2 \u00d7 1012 particles directly into the hepatic artery.",

We found that CAR is expressed at cell junctions between hepatocytes, in particular surrounding the bile canaliculi, a known location of tight junctions that are preventing bile leaks. In contrast, no CAR expression was detected at the surface of hepatocytes that is bordering the space of Disse, suggesting that CAR is not accessible to adenovirus particles in the blood. In addition, we found that CAR is expressed in the tumor cells but is low or absent in the vasculature of the tumor (Figure 7b). Together, these results indicate that limited access to the CAR receptor and poor viral replication in normal human hepatocytes may limit liver toxicity following delivery of oncolytic adenovirus in human subjects but may permit infection of tumor cells.",

We demonstrate that adenovirus replicates poorly in primary hepatocytes. The cells were infected with one viral particle per cell and after 72 hours no increase in viral particles per cell was detected in the normal hepatocytes. In contrast, 500\u20132500 adenoviral particles per cell were produced in the malignant hepatocytes, colorectal carcinoma and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. These findings indicate that adenovirus does not effectively infect or replicate in hepatocytes. Diminished infectivity and diminished replication could account for the low level of replication observed in hepatocytes infected with adenovirus.",

            "text": "We have previously demonstrated that the receptor for adenovirus (CAR) is localized to the sites of cell\u2013cell junctions in phenotypically normal mammary epithelial cells grown in three-dimensional cell culture, where it was inaccessible to adenovirus in the media.38 We hypothesized that CAR may be restricted to areas of cell\u2013cell contact in the normal liver and thus may be inaccessible to the vascular flow. Spatial restriction of CAR could explain the minimal hepatic toxicity observed among these patients. We used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression and localization of CAR in normal liver. We found that CAR is localized at sites of hepatocellular junctions, surrounding the bile canaliculi, which are sealed off from their surroundings by tight junctions. This is in agreement with CAR's physiological function as a cell-adhesion molecule that participates in the formation of tight junctions where it physically interacts with the tight-junction protein ZO-1.47 No CAR was detected at the hepatocyte surface facing the space of Disse or the hepatic sinusoids. Thus, CAR appears not to be accessible for circulating adenoviral particles passing through the liver. We further found that CAR is not expressed on the endothelium of tumor cells but is expressed on tumor cells. Therefore, the limited hepatic toxicity observed among the patients treated in this study may be related to spatial restriction of CAR in the liver. In addition, hepatic toxicity may be limited by the inability of Onyx-015 to replicate in normal hepatocytes. Taken together, these results indicate that tumor cells metastatic to the liver may be selectively susceptible to infection with adenovirus. Therefore, it is possible that CAR expression on tumor cells may predict response to treatment with oncolytic adenoviral vectors.",

Consequently, hepatic toxicity may have been observed among the patients if higher doses of Onyx-015 were administered. However, direct comparisons between rodents and humans are difficult especially with regard to the impact of hepatic artery infusion of adenovirus. The hepatic artery in rodents is very difficult to canulate. Consequently, hepatic toxicity has been evaluated after intravenous or intraperitoneal administration of adenovirus in mice.48 Dilution of the virus into the systemic circulation and uptake of virus in the spleen and other organs after intravenous or intraperitoneal administration will reduce the amount of virus delivered to the liver making comparison between human and rodent data difficult. However, a dose-limiting toxicity in humans was reached in a related trial using hepatic artery infusion of an adenovirus expressing p53.49 Dose-limiting cardiac output suppression rather than hepatic toxicity was observed following hepatic artery infusion of 7.5 \u00d7 1013 particles of an adenoviral vector expressing p53. Accounting for the difficulties in comparing human and rodent systems, similar if not higher doses of adenovirus have been administered to the hepatic artery of humans without the hepatic toxicity observed in rodents. In addition, as human adenovirus does not replicate in mouse tissues, the potential hepatic toxicity of replication competent viruses cannot be assessed in the rodent model but was not observed in the human trials.",

Variability was observed between patients and even within the same patient with repeated dosing, emphasizing the importance of careful evaluation and close monitoring of these patients. Further study of the immune response to adenoviral vectors is essential, especially if repetitive treatment is needed. Although thousands of patients have been safely treated with adenoviral vectors on various gene-therapy protocols and millions of people experience adenoviral infections each year without overt symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, idiosyncratic toxicities have occurred. Adenoviral vectors can be used to deliver unique and targeted therapies and can be a useful tool for the treatment of disease. Although additional research is needed to unravel the molecular basis for these idiosyncratic toxicities, it is likely that these toxicities can be avoided or effectively managed and that adenoviral vectors can be used with an acceptable level of risk, particularly among patients with incurable malignancies. With respect to the design of further clinical trials using adenoviral vectors, this study demonstrates that Onyx-015 can be delivered into the hepatic artery with minimal hepatic toxicity at doses where tumor responses were observed.",
