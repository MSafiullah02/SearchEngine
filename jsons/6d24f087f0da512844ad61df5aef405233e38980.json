Accordingly, societal efforts must be directed toward managing not only the pathogens themselves but also the environmental factors that facilitate their emergence, spread, and impacts. In addition to resolving the immense socioeconomic and cultural challenges to this goal, clearly we must develop a cross-disciplinary research program to address the consequences of increasing global connectedness and alteration of biological systems.

Its management requires consideration of stage-based processes and expansion phases quite similar to those of invasions of non-pathogenic organisms ( Figure 1 ).
