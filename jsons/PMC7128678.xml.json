            "text": "The recent emergence of the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a global pandemic [1], and there is an urgent need to identify active antiviral agents. Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay [2,3]. Several drugs have already been tested, among which chloroquine (CLQ), a well-known antimalarial drug, is one of the most promising as it has shown apparent efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia in recent clinical studies [4]. However, the mechanism of action of CLQ against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear as the drug seems to exert a broad range of potential antiviral effects [5]. Therefore, although CLQ is classically considered as an inhibitor of endocytic pathways through elevation of endosomal pH [6], its detailed molecular mechanism of action as an antiviral compound remains unclear [3,5]. Interestingly, CLQ has been shown to interfere with the terminal glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) [7], which acts as a plasma membrane receptor for both SARS-CoV [8] and SARS-CoV-2 [9], and CLQ could act at several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle [7]. These data suggest the interesting and mostly unexplored possibility that CLQ could prevent viral attachment through a direct effect on host cell surface molecules.",

The present study used a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches [11] to investigate the potential interaction between CLQ and sialic acids. A ganglioside-binding site in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was identified, and CLQ was shown to be a potential blocker of the S\u2013ganglioside interaction which occurs in the first step of the viral replication cycle (i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the S protein). In addition, the antiviral potential of CLQ and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH) against SARS-CoV-2 were compared. Overall, this study found that CLQ and CLQ-OH may be used to fight pathogenic human coronaviruses [3], [4], [5], [6], including SARS-CoV-2 [12].",

The initial coordinates of GM1 were obtained from CHARMM-GUI Glycolipid Modeler (http://www.charmmgui.org/?doc=input/glycolipid; [15]), which uses the internal coordinate information of common glycosidic torsion angle values, orients the ganglioside perpendicular to the membrane, and performs Langevin dynamics with a cylindrical restraint potential to keep the whole GM1 molecule cylindrical, especially the membrane-embedded ceramide part. In the next step, the ganglioside was included in a periodic box solvated with 1128 water molecules. The system was energy-minimized six times, switching between runs using the steepest descent gradients and runs using Polak\u2013Ribi\u00e8re conjugate gradients until convergence to machine precision. The ganglioside was subsequently merged with the NTD domain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein as obtained from pdb file # 6VSB [16]. Initial conditions corresponded to minimized structures obtained with the Polak\u2013Ribi\u00e8re algorithm. Docked complexes were subsequently submitted to iterative cycles of molecular dynamics using the CHARMM36 force field optimized for carbohydrates [17]. Interaction energies were calculated from stable complexes using the Ligand Energy Inspector function of Molegro [13].",

When CLQ was merged with Neu5Ac, a quasi-instantaneous fit occurred between the two molecules, whose global shapes in water are geometrically complementary Fig. 2\n(a). This is particularly obvious in the views of the CLQ\u2013Neu5Ac complex in mixed surface/balls and sticks rendition Fig. 2(a,b). The interaction was driven by the positioning of the negative charge of the carboxylate group of Neu5Ac and one of the two cationic charges of CLQ (pKa 10.2) Fig. 2(c). The energy of interaction of this complex was estimated to be -47 kJ.mol\u22121. As coronaviruses preferentially interact with 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (9-O-SIA) [10], this study used a similar molecular modelling approach to assess whether CLQ could also interact with this specific sialic acid. A good fit between CLQ and 9-O-SIA was obtained Fig. 2(d\u2013f), with an energy of interaction of -45 kJ.mol\u22121. In this case, the carboxylate group of the sialic acid interacted with the cationic group of the nitrogen-containing ring of CLQ (pKa 8.1) Fig. 2(d). The complex was further stabilized by OH-\u03c0 and van der Waals interactions.",

Molecular modelling approaches were used to assess whether CLQ and CLQ-OH can recognize sialic acid units in their natural molecular environment. In these simulations, ganglioside GM1 was chosen as a representative example of human plasma membrane gangliosides. A first series of simulations was performed with CLQ. When merged with the ganglioside, CLQ had two distinct binding sites, both located in the polar saccharide part of GM1. The first site was located at the tip of the saccharide moiety of the ganglioside Fig. 4\n(a,b). The energy of interaction was estimated to be -47 kJ.mol\u22121. CLQ retained the typical L-shape structure of the water-soluble conformer bound to isolated sialic acids [compare Figs 2(c) and 4(a)]. From a mechanistic point of view, the carboxylate group of the sialic acid of GM1 was oriented towards the cationic groups of CLQ. The rings of CLQ faced the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue of GM1, establishing both OH-\u03c0 interaction and hydrogen bonding Fig. 4(b). The second site was in a large area including both the ceramide\u2013sugar junction and the saccharide moiety Fig. 4(c). The chlorine atom of CLQ was oriented towards the ceramide axis, allowing the nitrogen-containing ring of CLQ to stack on to the pyrane ring of the first sugar residue [i.e. glucose (Glc)]. The perfect geometric complementarity of the two partners Fig. 4(c,d) accounted for a particularly high energy of interaction in this case (-61 kJ.mol\u22121). Interestingly, there was no overlap between the two CLQ-binding sites on GM1, so the ganglioside could accommodate two CLQ molecules Fig. 4(e), reaching a global energy of interaction of -108 kJ.mol\u22121. A similar situation was observed with CLQ-OH, which occupies the same binding site as CLQ Fig. 4(f). In this case, the energy of interaction was further increased by stabilizing contacts established between the two CLQ-OH molecules, reaching -120 kJ.mol\u22121. Overall, these data showed that CLQ and CLQ-OH have a good fit for sialic acids, either isolated or bound to gangliosides.",

The Xn intercalating segments, usually four to five residues, may contain any amino acid, but often Gly, Pro and/or Ser residues. The strict application of this algorithm did not allow the detection of any potential ganglioside-binding domain in this region of the NTD.

As shown in Fig. 6\n, the large flat area of this structural domain fitted very well with the protruding oligosaccharide part of the ganglioside. Several amino acid residues appear to be critical for this interaction, especially Phe-135, Asn-137 and Arg-158 (Table 1\n). Overall, the complex involved 10 amino acid residues for a total energy of interaction of -100 kJ.mol\u22121. At this stage, it was observed that approximately 50% of the interface was involved in the complex, leaving the remaining 50% available for interaction with a second GM1 molecule. As expected, merging a second GM1 molecule with the preformed GM1\u2013NTD complex led to a trimolecular complex consisting of two gangliosides in a typical symmetrical chalice-like structure into which the NTD could insert its interfacial ganglioside-binding domain (Fig. 7\n). The formation of this trimolecular complex was progressive, starting with a conformational rearrangement of the first ganglioside\u2013NTD complex triggered by the second GM1 molecule. The energy of interaction of the new complex was consistently increased by 37%, reaching an estimated value of -137 kJ.mol\u22121. At this stage, attachment of the NTD to the ganglioside-rich microdomain involved the whole interface (i.e. 15 surface-accessible residues from Asp-111 to Ser-162).

To improve clarity, the ganglioside is not presented in Fig. 9. This superposition shows that the NTD and the drug (CLQ-OH in this case) share the same spatial position when bound to GM1, so GM1 cannot bind the viral protein and the drug simultaneously. This is due to the fact that the NTD and the drugs (CLQ and CLQ-OH) bind to GM1 with a similar mechanism controlled by a dyad of functional interactions: a hydrogen bond and a geometrically perfect CH-\u03c0 stacking interaction. In the case of the NTD, the hydrogen bond involves Asn-167, whereas CH-\u03c0 stacking is mediated by the aromatic ring of Phe-135 Fig. 6(b). On one hand, Asn-167 establishes a network of hydrogen bonds with the GalNAc residue of GM1. On the other hand, the flat aromatic ring of Phe-135 stacks on to the cycle of the Glc residue of GM1. In the case of CLQ and CLQ-OH, it is the nitrogen-containing ring of the drug that stacks on to the Glc ring Fig. 4(c). Note that both the Phe-135 (in red) and CLQ-OH (in green) rings are located in the same position (Fig. 9). The other CLQ-OH molecule, which covers the tip of the sugar part of the ganglioside, interacts with the GalNAc ganglioside Fig. 4(b). When the NTD is bound to the ganglioside, the side chain of Asn-137 is found in this exact position (Fig. 9). Thus, once two CLQ-OH (or two CLQ) molecules are bound to a ganglioside Fig. 4(e,f), any binding of a SARS-Cov-2 S protein to the same ganglioside is totally prevented. The energy required to overcome this steric incompatibility is estimated to be several hundred kJ.mol\u22121, which is far too high to occur.",

In this region, which contains the ganglioside-binding domain identified in the present report, all amino acids are fully conserved. Interestingly, the motif is built like a giant consensus ganglioside-binding domain: a central region displaying the critical aromatic residue (Phe-135) and a basic residue at each end (Lys-113 and Arg-158). In the middle of each stretch separating this typical triad, there is a N-glycosylation site (Asn-122 and Asn-149). These last regions are not directly involved in ganglioside binding, so the oligosaccharide linked to these asparagine residues could be perfectly intercalated between the sugar head group of gangliosides.",

These viruses include major human pathogens affecting the respiratory tract, such as influenza [21] and coronaviruses [22,23]. The attachment to sialic-acid-containing cell surface structures is mediated by receptor-binding proteins that belong to the viral spike. In the case of coronaviruses, this function is fulfilled by the S glycoprotein [9,24]. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 interact with the ACE-2 protein, which has been identified as a key determinant of the contagiousness of viruses [8]. However, considering the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV, binding to ACE-2 alone might not be enough to ensure robust infection of the upper respiratory tract. Thus, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 might also bind to other cell surface attachment factors, such as sialic-acid-containing glycoproteins and gangliosides. Consistent with this notion, it has been shown that depletion of cell surface sialic acids by neuraminidase treatment inhibited MERS-CoV entry of human airway cells [25]. These data, which provide direct evidence that sialic acids play a critical role in human coronavirus attachment, broaden the therapeutic options to block the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Modelling approaches have been used successfully to decipher various molecular mechanisms of protein\u2013sugar interactions accounting for the interaction of virus [27], bacteria [28], membrane [13] and amyloid proteins [20] with cell surface glycolipids. This in-silico strategy was applied to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral mechanisms of CLQ and CLQ-OH against SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, it was shown that CLQ and CLQ-OH bind readily to sialic acids with high affinity, including the typical 9-O-SIA subtype recognized by coronaviruses [23]. Next, it was shown that CLQ and CLQ-OH also bind to sialic-acid-containing gangliosides. Based on these data, the drugs may also recognize the sialic acid residues of glycoproteins. Further studies will help clarify this point.",

Two CLQ (or two CLQ-OH) molecules can bind simultaneously to the polar head group of ganglioside GM1. Interestingly, these simulations indicated that CLQ-OH is more potent than CLQ, in line with the reported increased antiviral activity of CLQ-OH against SARS-CoV-2 [30]. Once bound to GM1, the drugs prevent any access to the Glc and GalNAc units of the ganglioside, which are the critical binding residues for Phe-135 and Asn-137, respectively. This amino acid dyad, as well as all the other residues that mediate ganglioside binding by the SARS-CoV-2 spike, is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide. It is also conserved in the bat RaTG13 isolate, which reinforces the hypothesis of bat-to-human transmission. From an epidemiological point of view, it can be hypothesized that the evolution of this motif has conferred an enhanced attachment capacity of human coronaviruses to the respiratory tract through improved S\u2013ganglioside interactions.",
