Nurses also immersed themselves in patient care as a way of managing their anxiety and pressures in an ever changing and dynamic environment Liehr, 2009, Chung et al., 2005) .

Nurses felt vulnerable and worried about future litigation related to the need to prioritise resources and patient needs in a time where they had to ration and deny services to some patients (Ives et al., 2009 ). The sense of powerlessness was overwhelming for nurses as they were under extreme pressure and often feared that their practice was being affected by work demands and community fear generated by the pandemic Hung, 2013, Chung et al., 2005) . Despite the professional camaraderie, the unfamiliarity of the pandemic environment created a sense of loneliness (Kim, 2018) and frustration among nurses. Additionally, relatives of patients were seen to be projecting their emotions towards the nurses (Holroyd and McNaught, 2008, Kim, 2018) . Not having control over patient flow also generated both physical and psychological exhaustion (Kang et al., 2018) .

One of the major factors that influenced nurses' ability to cope with the demanding workload during the pandemic were staffing shortages (Lam and Hung, 2013 , Kang et al, 2018 , Corley et al., 2010 . A lack of staff made ensuring adequate staff skill mix for managing high acuity patients challenging, not only creating pressure on more junior staff but also the senior staff who had to support them (Corley et al., 2010) . Such pressure on the nursing workforce meant nurses had to adapt to changes quickly, often in suboptimal conditions, with high patient turnover and limited isolation rooms (Holroyd and McNaught, 2008 , Wong et al., 2011 , Liu and Liehr, 2009 . Nurses believe that one of their greatest challenges working during the pandemic was a lack of preparedness planning at both a management and health department level (Kok et al., 2012 , Lam et al, 2020 .",

The concept of doing the right thing doesn't only exist in times of crisis.

Firstly, although a comprehensive search of the databases using the best key word combinations was undertaken, publications not indexed in these data bases could have been omitted. In addition, this review only included studies published in English. Therefore, studies published in other native languages, where the SARS pandemic was widespread, could have been excluded. Furthermore, despite being the largest percentage of the nursing workforce, female nurses were largely represented in the included studies. Hence the experiences reported in the review may not be representative of male nurses.",

            "text": "The findings from this review suggest that there is a need for Governments, policy makers, nursing groups and health care organisations to actively engage in supporting nurses both during and following a pandemic or epidemic. This engagement needs to be multifaceted and recognise the importance of nurses and the nursing role to pandemic and epidemic control. It is vital that nurses receive clear, concise and current information about best practice nursing care and infection control, as well as sufficient access to appropriate PPE to optimise their safety. Adequate staffing is essential to ensure that nurses are able to take breaks during shifts, take leave when they are ill and provide appropriate skill mix. Support for nurses to manage competing family responsibilities and maintain safe contact and communication with family members can reduce personal stress and anxiety. Finally, the physical and psychological impact of working during a pandemic or epidemic on nurses needs to be recognised and made visible. To promote physical and mental health among nurses and ensure that they stay in the workforce, Governments, policy makers, nursing groups and health care organisations must closely monitor nurses' support needs both during the pandemic or epidemic and in the following period and be agile and responsive to these with meaningful support systems. Without this support nurses are likely to experience significant stress, anxiety, and physical side-effects all of which can lead to burnout and loss of nurses from the workforce.",
