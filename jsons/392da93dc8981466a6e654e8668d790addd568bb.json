These apneic spells were associated with bradycardia. They occurred unexpectedly and had no further explanation (patent ductus arteriosus, bacterial infection, central nervous system damage). Electroencephalogram failed to prove subclinical seizures. Apneas were resistant to methylxanthine and gastroesophageal reflux treatment. Neither cough nor rhinorrhea was observed. Chest X-ray remained unchanged. All neonates recovered within 10 days. In two cases, subcutaneous atropine 0.01 mg/kg reduced bradycardia. In two cases, assisted ventilation was necessary.",
