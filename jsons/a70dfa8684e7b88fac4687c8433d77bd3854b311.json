One of the obligations of the Romanian land owners and farmers is to avoid the installation of unwanted vegetation on their land plots. This vegetation is represented by some species of herbaceous or woody plants, annual or perennial, that spontaneously invade the agricultural lands, diminishing the production capacity of the cultivated plants. Included in this category are 10 meadow weeds, without fodder value or even toxic to animals: Arctium lappa L., Carduus nutans L., Conium maculatum L., Eryngium campestre L., Euphorbia cyparissias L., Pteridium aquilinum (L.)

            "text": "The European Union (EU)'s common agricultural policy (CAP) is one of the world's largest agricultural policies and the EU's longest-prevailing one (Pe'er et al., 2019) . Besides producing food and stimulating rural community development, the CAP defines one more condition that allows farmers to fulfill their functions in society-environmentally sustainable farming-to produce food while simultaneously protecting nature and safeguarding biodiversity (European Commission, 2020a) . Cross-compliance is a CAP's mechanism that links direct payments to compliance by farmers with basic standards concerning the environment, food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare, as well as the requirement of maintaining land in good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC). Evidence has shown that agriculture is the single largest cause of biodiversity loss but already nearly one-third of the world's farms have adopted more environmentally friendly practices while continuing to be productive (Pretty et al., 2018) . In Europe, since 2005, all EU farmers receiving direct payments under CAP are subject to compulsory cross-compliance which is an important tool for integrating environmental requirements into the CAP (European Commission, 2020b). The good GAECs and the statutory management requirements (SMR), refer to a set of EU standards and requirements aiming at sustainable agriculture (European Parliament, 2013) . In the area \"Environment, climate change, good agricultural condition of land,\" when referring to the issue of \"Landscape, minimum level of maintenance,\" GAEC 7 requires \"Retention of landscape features, including where appropriate, hedges, ponds, ditches, trees in line, in group or isolated, field margins and terraces, and including a ban on cutting hedges and trees during the bird breeding and rearing season and, as an option, measures for avoiding invasive plant species\" (European Parliament, 2013) . After they are defined and detailed at national or regional level, all these standards are to be respected by all the European farmers receiving direct payments or some of the rural development payments.",

The number of retrieved abstracts was below 10, irrespective of the species searched for. This result was somehow anticipated by the guest editors of the research topic when they expected that \"ethnopharmacological research in this area is quite limited, many of the existing studies being published in national or local journals, thus being less visible to the scientific community.\" To expand the literature search, Google Scholar database was interrogated, and all the retrieved publication was selected based in the information provided by their abstracts and subsequently by their full text version. Only peer-reviewed articles were included in our review. To access the literature published in the Romanian language, the online catalog of the County Library \"G. T. Kirileanu\" Neamt was searched using the eBibliophil search engine (https:// bibgtkneamt.ebibliophil.ro).

Overgrazing leads to the invasion of ruderal plant species, later on categorized as \"unwanted\" weed species by APIA. From the phytosociological point of view, two of the 10 species, i.e. E. cyparissias and R. acetosella, are natural components of most of the grasslands in the vegetation classes Festuco-Brometea (E. cyparissias) and Molinio-Arrhenatheretea (R. acetosella) (Sanda et al., 2008; Chifu, 2014) , and they were erroneously categorized as unwanted vegetation in APIA's guide (Agency for Payments and Intervention in Agriculture, 2019a). Moreover, some of the other 10 species are not the most common and widespread species of their genus in Romania, e.g. Carduus acanthoides invades many more hectares of degraded grasslands than C. nutans (Sarateanu et al., 2008) . All the above considered, the APIA's documents with respect to the invasive and unwanted vegetation should be critically reviewed and updated for the future post-2020 CAP.",

In Bosnia and Herzegovina this plant is used to treat skin conditions, to strengthen the hair root, against intestinal parasites, for dissolution of kidney stone, for improved urination, against diabetes and rabies, dog's bites, to release stomach gasses, against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and to treat facial nerve inflammation etc. (Redzic, 2010) .",

Despite its poisonous nature, C. maculatum is included in several herbals as Succus conii, described as a narcotic, sedative, analgesic, spasmolytic, anti-aphrodisiac, and anti-cancer agent (Reynolds, 2005) . C. maculatum extract is used as a traditional homeopathic remedy for cervix carcinoma (Mondal et al., 2014) . This species has been used in ethnomedicine as an analgesic and antiinflammatory agent (De Landoni and Conium maculatum, 1990; Arihan et al., 2009; Al-Snafi, 2016,; Madaan and Kumar, 2012) , in Turkey to treat diabetes (Paksoy et al., 2016) , and in Morocco as an alternative to treat typhoid fever and sterility, and also to ease labor (Kharchoufa et al., 2018) . Externally, it has been used to treat herpes and swelled joints (Bloch, 2001) . Some studies highlight the antispasmodic property of C. maculatum and it was reported to have a positive impact on patients with epilepsy, asthma, angina, rheumatism, and tetanus (Mitich, 1998; Hotti and Rischer, 2017) .",
