Many researchers have studied the epidemic threshold of epidemic models above which a global outbreak can occur, starting from an infinitesimal fraction of seeds. However, there have been few studies of epidemic models with finite fractions of seeds. The aim of this paper is to clarify what happens in phase transitions in such cases. The SIR model in networks exhibits two percolation transitions. We derive the percolation transition points for the SIR model with multiple seeds to show that as the infection rate increases epidemic clusters generated from each seed percolate before a single seed can induce a global outbreak.",

Understanding how infectious diseases spread in our society is crucial to the development of strategies for disease control. A mathematical model of infectious disease, called the susceptible-infectedremoved (SIR) model, was first applied with the assumption of a well-mixed population for computation of the final numbers of infected and eventually removed (or recovered) individuals [1] . So far, many mathematical models of infectious diseases have been proposed for understanding the spread of epidemics and proposing strategies for disease control [2] .",

Diseases spread over the networks of physical contacts between individuals, and the structure of real networks [4] [5] [6] [7] has crucial effects on this spread. For example, Moreno et al. [8] studied the SIR model in a scale-free network having a degree distribution of p k \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 using a degree-based mean-field approach. Their approximation clarified that epidemics can spread over the network for any infection rate if \u03b3 3. In addition, many analytical approaches for epidemic models with network structures, such as the approximation onto a bond percolation problem [9, 10] , the edge-based compartment model [11] , the effective degree approach [12] , and the pair approximation [13, 14] , have been proposed and have succeeded in describing epidemic dynamics. Numerical simulations have revealed how epidemics spread in more realistic situations. Also, several strategies for disease control have been proposed on the basis of the knowledge of epidemics on networks, e.g., target immunization [15, 16] , acquaintance immunization [16] [17] [18] [19] , and graph-partitioning immunization [20] .",

Hu et al. [22] numerically studied how the positions of multiple seeds in a network affect spreading behavior. Ji et al.

What we discuss here is a more fundamental, but almost overlooked problem: How do epidemic models with finite fractions of seeds undergo phase transitions?

Epidemic clusters generated by multiple seeds will have global connectivity in some parameter regions even though each seed may not have the potential to induce a global outbreak there.",

An epidemic cluster grows from each of multiple seeds. We regard the clusters so generated as supernodes and study the percolation problem of these supernodes. Indeed, we can analytically and numerically obtain the percolation transition point of supernodes to show a gap between this transition point and the epidemic threshold. The existence of this gap indicates that the percolation transition of epidemic clusters occurs before a single seed can induce a global outbreak. Our result also shows the sensitivity of the seed fraction on percolation transition points, i.e., that a small seed fraction drastically reduces the critical infection rate for the emergence of the infinite epidemic cluster.",

The infection rate is denoted by \u03bb. When an infected node is adjacent to a susceptible node, this susceptible node gets infected with probability \u03bb t within a short time, t. Note that this probability is independently given by each of the infected nodes so that the total infection rate at a node is just proportional to the number of infected neighbors. An infected node becomes removed at a rate \u03bc, i.e., with probability \u03bc t within a short time t, irrespective of the neighbors' states.

Note that \u03bb c1 corresponds to \u03bb SIR c in the limit \u03c1 \u2192 0 by definition. Percolation analysis of an epidemic cluster starting from a single seed has been used for numerical computations of the epidemic threshold and critical properties [26, 27] . The latter point, \u03bb c2 , is on the percolation of the S component (also called the residual graph [28, 29] ) and is usually larger than \u03bb c1 . Above \u03bb c2 , the network remaining after removal of the R components is disintegrated such that the sizes of all remaining components are finite. In other words, the mean fraction of the largest S component, s max (N ) = S max (N )/N, where S max (N) is the mean largest S-component size, is 0 (nonzero) for \u03bb > \u03bb c2 (\u03bb < \u03bb c2 ) when N 1. Whether the susceptible nodes are globally connected is important because a second epidemic spread may occur in the remaining network [28, 30] . In [28] , Newman analyzed this second transition point of the SIR model with transmissibility in uncorrelated networks with \u03c1 \u2192 0 to show that the transition point is positive even when \u03b3 3. Valdez et al. [31] proposed a new strategy for suppressing epidemics by regarding this second transition point as a measure of the efficiency of a mitigation or control strategy. If we regard the present model as showing the propagation of an attack against a network, such as a computer virus, \u03bb c2 is a measure of the robustness of networks against such attacks [32, 33] . Konno and the authors numerically studied \u03bb c2 for correlated networks to show that any positive or negative degree correlation makes networks more robust [33] .",

To investigate in detail the phase transitions of the SIR model with a finite fraction of seeds, we focus on the z-regular random graph (RRG). Our formulations discussed below are for the RRG. The extension to degree-uncorrelated networks having degree distribution p(k) may be straightforward, although its execution will be cumbersome. At any rate, our findings obtained from the RRG probably will be in common with other networks. In Sec. IV D, we numerically study the outbreaks induced by multiple seeds in finite-dimensional Euclidean lattices.",

In contrast, the Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the model actually exhibits phase transitions. In Fig. 1(b) , we plot the R and S susceptibilities (which we call the susceptibility by analogy with the magnetic susceptibility in spin systems) \u03c7 R and \u03c7 S . Here, \u03c7 R (\u03c7 S ) is defined as the mean size of all R components (S components) except the largest one [34] . We find that \u03c7 R and \u03c7 S have peaks at \u03bb c1 and \u03bb c2 , respectively, implying two phase transitions. Moreover, these points are clearly different from \u03bb SIR c . In particular, the gap between \u03bb c1 and \u03bb SIR c indicates that as the infection rate increases, the epidemic clusters generated from each seed percolate before a single seed can induce a global outbreak. In the next section, we derive these percolation transition points for 0 < \u03c1 < 1.",

Through analytical estimates and numerical simulations, we have obtained the phase diagram in (\u03c1,\u03bb) space. The SIR model with numerous seeds shows the percolation transition of the removed and susceptible nodes at \u03bb c1 and \u03bb c2 , respectively. In particular, \u03bb c1 is smaller than the epidemic threshold \u03bb SIR c as long as \u03c1 > 0. This means that epidemic clusters generated by multiple seeds percolate without global outbreaks.",

            "text": "So far, we have focused on the SIR model in the RRG and the lattices. We expect that the above statement holds for the SIR model in other networks, although the details of the phase transition may depend on network structures, e.g., \u03bb c1 < \u03bb SIR c = 0 in a fat-tailed scale-free network with \u03b3 3. Finally, we briefly discuss other epidemic models with multiple seeds. Krapivsky et al. [39] proposed an extended SIR model, called a transient fad, with the assumption of a well-mixed population. They analytically showed that this model exhibits a discontinuous transition if \u03c1 > 0. The authors and a collaborator [40] performed Monte Carlo simulations for this fad model in networks to confirm that a discontinuous jump of the order parameter appears near the epidemic threshold, which is behind the percolation of epidemic clusters. The authors also investigated the discretetime version of the transient fad to confirm it numerically and analytically [41] . Very recently, several generalized epidemic models in networks beyond the classical SIR model have been investigated [42] [43] [44] [45] . It will be interesting to clarify what numerous seeds induce in such generalized epidemic models. ",
