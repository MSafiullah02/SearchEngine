This was a prospective cohort study conducted at the Federal University of Bahia Hospital in Salvador, Northeast Brazil (clinical trial on the use of amoxicillin, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01200706). From November 2006 to April 2011 community-dwelling children were seen at the Pediatric Emergency Department and diagnosed by the pediatrician on duty with non-severe CAP. CAP diagnosis was based on 1) respiratory complaints (cough or difficulty breathing) plus 2) lower respiratory pathologic findings plus 3) presence of pulmonary infiltrate or consolidation on the chest radiograph (CXR) (frontal and lateral views) taken on admission and read by the pediatrician on duty. Non-severe CAP cases were defined according to the World Health Organization criteria for severity of CAP 2000 [6]. That means, eligible patients did not present any of the following items: lower chest indrawing, inability to drink, seizure, somnolence, central cyanosis, grunting in a calm child, and nasal flaring. The exclusion criteria comprised chronic debilitating diseases (anatomic abnormalities of the respiratory tract, cancer, chronic pulmonary illness besides asthma, immunological defects, progressing neurological disorders, psychomotor retardation, heart disease with clinical repercussion, hemoglobinopathy, liver or kidney disease, severe malnutrition), other concurrent infection, HIV-infected mother, hospitalization during the previous 7 days, amoxicillin or other antibiotics use during the last 48 h, amoxicillin allergy, or history of aspiration. The primary results of the clinical trial were published in 2014 [7].",

If there was disagreement between the initial radiologists, CXR was sent to a third pediatric radiologist who used the same methods. CXR reading was finally defined as agreed or not by two radiologists.

After thawing, a multiplex real-time PCR test kit (Anyplex [TM] II RV16, Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) [11] was performed to detect the following viruses: human adenovirus (HAdV), influenza A (Flu A) and B (Flu B) viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134 (PIV 1, PIV 2, PIV 3, PIV 4), rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial viruses A (RSV A) and B (RSV B), human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), coronaviruses 229E (HCoV 229E), NL63 (HCoV NL63), and OC43 (HCoV OC43), metapneumovirus (hMPV), and enteroviruses (EV) in NPA. The Anyplex (TM) II RV16 detection kit is a multiplex real-time PCR assay based on tagging oligonucleotide cleavage extension. Moreover, an in-house triplex PCR test was used to detect RV, EV, and RSV in NPA samples, as already reported [12].

Thus, the sample size was estimated as 684 cases in the study group. We performed a bivariate analysis: the frequency of each respiratory virus was compared by using chi-square or Fisher\u2019s exact test as appropriate; continuous variables were presented as median (interquartile range [IQR]) and were assessed by using Mann-Whitney U test due to non-parametrical distribution. As the frequency of missing information was very low, we chose to handle the missing data by excluding the cases with missing information.

Another study conducted in Spain detected respiratory viruses in 83% of children aged under 18 months hospitalized with CAP [15]. Both studies employed PCR to search for the respiratory viruses in NPA: in the Swedish study, single agent and duplex real-time PCRs and in the Spanish study, multiplex PCR assay. It has been previously reported that the detection rate of singleplex PCR is higher when compared to the multiplex one showing that the singleplex PCR is more sensitive than the multiplex PCR for the specific virus [16]. However, combination of multiplex PCR tests can provide a 100% recovery rate [17]. Therefore, we attribute our high detection rate to the employment of both triplex and multiplex PCRs in this study.",

RV was also the most commonly detected virus among 76 children aged 6 months to 15 years hospitalized for CAP in Turku, Finland [18]. As opposed to what was pointed out by Pavia [19], EV was commonly found in our study and this can be explained by our use of two different PCR techniques to search for it. In fact, this can also explain the high rate of RV detection that, in our study, was the most frequently detected virus unlike previously published studies which showed RSV to have the highest detection rate [14,15]. We employed an in-house triplex PCR to search for RV, EV, and RSV besides the multiplex PCR that also investigated the presence of these three viruses along with the other 13 respiratory viruses. Notably, the pathogenic role of RV has been recently described in adults with CAP, with a more modest association in older children (5\u201317 years old) [20]. Additionally, RV was identified as one of the major microorganisms associated with CAP in children <5 years of age from developing and emerging countries hospitalized with CAP in a multicenter case-control study [21].",

In our study, Flu A and B, RSV A and B, as well as PIV 1 and PIV 4, were similarly found in cases with sole or multiple virus detection whereas the other respiratory viruses were more common in cases with multiple virus detections (Table 3). As a matter of fact, multiple virus detection can comprise past infection, symptomatic infection, or even upcoming infection. The role of each virus found in multiple virus detection is a very complex issue. Herein, HBoV1 was more frequently found in multiple then in sole virus detection (Table 3). However, we have demonstrated that acute serologically diagnosed HBoV1 infection occurred in 22.5% of cases with multiple virus detection, as well as in 50.0% of cases with sole virus detection [13]. The challenge is to show causativeness. Effect-cause is often a problem in cross-sectional and case-control studies, especially when the predictor variable is a laboratory test; even in cohort studies, effect-cause is difficult to be shown if the disease has a long latent period [24]. In terms of lung infection like CAP, the ideal investigation should comprise lung tap [25]. Nonetheless, for ethical reasons, lung specimens are rarely obtained, so NPA are used to infer what is infecting the lung. Many of the same pathogens present in NPA can also cause CAP, might be involved in the causal chain of CAP, or might represent a concurrent upper respiratory tract infection or colonization unrelated to the pneumonic process [26]. That is why serology is a potential tool to clarify this issue [27].",

However, it has also been reported that RSV infection in younger children are more severe than in older ones [19]. Interestingly, all of our cases had non-severe CAP and RSVA was found in younger cases and in cases with shorter duration of disease. These findings demonstrate the wide presentation of RSV infection in children and may be useful in the implementation of the upcoming vaccines for the prevention of RSV infection in children [28] prioritized by age stratum. Noteworthily, all patients with enterovirus, bocavirus, influenza, or coronavirus reported fever whereas 3 quarters of the patients with rhinovirus reported it (Table 6; P = 0.04). Additionally, none of the patients with coronavirus had crackles nor tachypnea, whereas 77.8% and 61.1% of the patients with metapneumovirus had crackles and tachypnea, respectively (Table 6; P < 0.001 and 0.007, respectively).
