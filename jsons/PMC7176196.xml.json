More and more, this form of analysis is now positively impacting the field of infectious diseases as well. This trend has been driven, on the one hand, by methodical improvements that make it possible to miniaturize and simplify test systems (Chapter 9, 10) and by the constant demand from many physicians for immediate test results, on the other. Meanwhile, the range of microbiological parameters available at the POC has been extended considerably (Table 20.1). A POCT result, however, should always be regarded and interpreted in the context of the clinical symptoms and the current epidemiological situation. Proper handling of POCT systems and strict consideration of pre-analytical limitations are decisive in obtaining reliable test results.",

The immediate availability of rapid HIV test results, for example, is helpful for decision-making about prophylactic antiretroviral treatment during childbirth or for people with occupational exposure to HIV. Intrapartum detection of group B streptococci in women in labor or the detection of plasmodia spp., including self-testing by patients with suspected malaria infection, are similar situations where POCT proves its merits. Here, too, the presence of a pathogen can be detected immediately using an antigen test whereupon early, targeted antimicrobial therapy can lessen or even prevent infection. POCT is also useful for guiding treatment of viral infections. The effectiveness of zanamivir or oseltamivir in influenza treatment depends on them being given no later than 36\u201348 hours after the first symptoms develop [32]. This approach is similar with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Studies have shown that treatment with ribavirin in RSV bronchopneumonia is only successful if initiated early enough [5].",

Such targeted situations not only arise in hospitals where there is the risk of an undetected pathogen spreading from patient to patient. There are also constellations when a transmission risk is associated with outpatients. For example, it is well known that a high percentage of patients coming to an HIV or sexual health clinic will skip their follow-up appointment because they fear an unfavorable diagnosis [43]. Although this avoidance behavior is understandable, it is a problem insofar as test results usually confirm infection (HIV, gonorrhea or chlamydia infection). As such, this has far-reaching consequences for the patients themselves as well as for their sexual partner(s). Data from the USA spotlight the extent of this problem. In one study of an HIV clinic, more than a quarter of the 68,000 people seeking advice and undergoing a conventional HIV test did not attend their scheduled 2-week follow-up appointment to pick up the test result. This was different when the rapid HIV test was performed. Only 2.3 % of the 33,000 people that had the rapid test left the clinic before receiving their test result [47].",

Indeed, evaluation studies on rapid detection tests for streptococci have clearly shown that the quality and reliability of test results is essentially dependent on the training and experience of the person taking the throat swab or performing the rapid test.

The majority of tests nowadays use immunochromatography (Chapter 9) with moderate to high sensitivity (70\u201390 %) and relatively high specificity (>95 %). In exceptional cases, like with rapid HIV tests, today\u2019s POCT methods can achieve results that are indeed as reliable as those of conventional diagnostics. Some POCT systems with potentially limited sensitivity to a suspected pathogen (e.g. influenza viruses, RSV, rotaviruses, noroviruses or adenoviruses) may be compromised by patterns of seasonal variations in the prevalence of that organism. This has a considerable impact on the clinical reliability of the test, as exemplified by the immunochromatographic rapid influenza diagnostic test (Fig. 20.1). A low prevalence (2.5 % in the example given) is expected at the start of a seasonal flu outbreak. Despite high sensitivity (80 % in this example) and very high specificity (95 %), the negative predictive value (99 %) of the test is expected to be significantly higher than the positive predictive value (29 %). This is because the rapid test shows false-positive (49-fold) more often than true-positive (20-fold) results under these circumstances. Not until the prevalence rises to 10 %, which can certainly happen during a severe flu outbreak, does the positive predictive value increase (64 %). Of course, the biostatistical relationships shown here hold true for other infectious diseases that follow a seasonal pattern as well. In other words, the use of tests with limited sensitivity can yield more false results at the start of an outbreak when prevalence is still low. This, in turn, could certainly lead to an underappreciation of the extent of a disease [17] and must be taken into account when using POCT.\n",

Linked assays incorporating multiplex technology allow more complex questions to be processed within one PCR run (e.g. detection of the following: S. aureus plus detection of methicillin resistance (mecA); two determinants (vanA and vanB) of vancomycin resistance in enterococci; clostridium difficile toxin B, also encompassing binary toxins and the tcdC deletion to detect highly virulent variants; mycobacterium tuberculosis also encompassing the rifampicin resistance (rpo) for detecting multi-drug resistant tuberculosis strains; simultaneous detection of influenza A, A/H1N1 and influenza B). The recently available i-system by Alere, which relies on isothermal amplification to detect the influenza A/B viruses and group A streptococci, (Chapter 10) can boast significantly better sensitivity and specificity compared to the antigen detection method with the correspondingly more reliable results [7, 23, 31]. Besides its i-system, Alere also offers the q-Analyzer as a fully automated NAT platform.",

Even assuming that near-patient diagnostics saves on laboratory tests and associated costs, POCT processes in general, and molecular assays in particular, are significantly more expensive than conventional (laboratory) tests. Moreover, POCT can create extra work for staff that were not previously involved in diagnostic tasks and possibly needs to be considered in job planning [24]. The question inevitably arises, as to how far near-patient microbiological analysis actually adds value to justify the added financial expenditure. Comprehensive reviews of this topic are rare and, if available, do not give the full picture either. The main difficulty is that the issues relating to the weighing of cost-effectiveness against the medical benefit of near-patient testing are multifactorial and complex, with all aspects above and beyond this being closely interlinked. It is therefore not possible to find a global solution. In fact, a well-justified estimation depends much more on the circumstances of the individual case. In addition, international study data cannot simply be applied to the situation in Germany because hospitals charge health insurance companies, using the German (diagnosis-related group) DRG system.",

However, this additional cost for PCR testing may be justified when considering that every MRSA transmission prevented by early detection can save a hospital several thousand euros in added costs. Therefore, the cost-benefit ratio shifts in favor of PCR. Even when each case is balanced against a successful coding in the DRG flat rate payment system, the added costs incurred by MRSA transmission are only partially compensated. Furthermore, every new, preventable case of MRSA has the potential to impact negatively on public image and may result in lost revenue due to canceled admissions, which most hospitals should be eager to avoid [41].",

Nevertheless, the current data suggest that the benefit of molecular MRSA screening will only outweigh the costs for patients with a particularly high MRSA risk, e.g. in areas with a high MRSA prevalence [41]. At present, German hospitals remain hesitant.
