The PCR signal generated was quite weak and was not observed with any of the other samples. Considering that all the samples will have contained X-chromosome DNA, the fact that only two of 221 samples tested positive could reflect sequence differences at the primer binding sites of the X-chromosome, or simply different amounts of X-chromosome DNA in the samples. The replicase gene PCR could be used as a screening tool, but all positive findings should be confirmed by sequencing. The higher sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR in comparison with the two conventional RT-PCRs, together with a more convenient protocol, supports the use of this method as a screening tool.",

The present study also found evidence of shorter hospitalisation periods with hMPV infection, while the similar rate at which chest X-rays were taken and the low frequency of antibiotic treatment strengthen the observations made by Williams et al. [10]. To determine the incidence and clinical features of HCoV-NL63 and hMPV infection, testing was limited to these two viruses and RSV. Thus, the overall burden of infection caused by respiratory tract pathogens was not investigated, and it is possible that some co-infections with other viruses or bacteria were not detected.",
