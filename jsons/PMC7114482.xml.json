            "text": "Toroviruses have been described as potential gastroenteritis causing agents in horses, cows, pigs and humans. They were classified as a new genus within the family Coronaviridae, from the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh et al., 1994), although the possibility of establishing two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae within the family Coronaviridae has been proposed and is currently under consideration (Gonzalez et al., 2003, Coronaviridae Study Group, 2008). Torovirus genome consists of a single RNA molecule of about 25\u201330 kb. Genome organization is similar to that of coronavirus: the 5\u2032 two-thirds contain two large and overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, that code for the replication machinery. The last third of the genome contains four open reading frames, ORFs 2\u20135, coding respectively for the structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and nucleocapsid (N). Torovirus particles have a characteristic torus-shape nucleocapsid formed by the N protein interacting with the viral RNA. The nucleocapsid is surrounded by an envelope that contains the triple spanning M protein, and the S and HE proteins that conform the large and short spikes, respectively.",

A morphologically related virus was later found in a cattle farm from Breda (Iowa), and this bovine torovirus (BToV) was designated BRV (Woode et al., 1982). Over the years, there have been a few reports describing the presence of toroviral particles in faecal samples from humans (HToV) (Beards et al., 1986, Duckmanton et al., 1997, Koopmans et al., 1997, Krishnan and Naik, 1997, Jamieson et al., 1998, Uziel et al., 1999, Lodha et al., 2005) and pigs (PToV) (Scott et al., 1987, Woode, 1987, Durham et al., 1989, Penrith and Gerdes, 1992, Lavazza et al., 1996). PToV has later been detected by RT-PCR in swine faecal specimens from farms in The Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary and Italy (Kroneman et al., 1998, Matiz et al., 2002). Moreover, a partial genomic characterization of five European PToV isolates has been reported (Smits et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Epidemiological surveys about toroviruses have been largely concentrated on BToV, and they showed that this virus is distributed worldwide, having been detected in United States, Japan, South Korea, India, and in different European countries like United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, France, Switzerland, and Italy (Liebler et al., 1992, Koopmans et al., 1991, Ito et al., 2007, Park et al., 2007, Van Kruiningen et al., 1992, Krishnan and Naik, 1997, Koopmans et al., 1989, Weiss et al., 1984, Lavazza, 1989). Moreover, high seroprevalences against BToV have been reported in cattle from United Kingdom (Brown et al., 1987), The Netherlands and Germany (Koopmans et al., 1989). Although there are few reports about PToV epidemiology, high seroprevalences, similar to those of BToV, have also been reported in swine populations from Switzerland (Weiss et al., 1984) and The Netherlands (Kroneman et al., 1998). Despite this extensive geographical distribution and the broad host range, these viruses have attracted little attention. This is likely due in part to the fact that torovirus infection has not been associated with disease causing important losses in livestock, but also to the lack of an \u201cin vitro\u201d system to work with most of these viruses, that has precluded the development of specific tools for their diagnosis. For a long time only the equine isolate BEV could be grown in cell cultures (Weiss et al., 1983), and, it has only been very recently reported the ability of a BToV variant isolated in Japan to grow in cells derived from a human rectal adenocarcinoma (Kuwabara et al., 2007). In addition, BToV can be propagated in experimentally infected gnobiotic calves (Woode et al., 1982). Thus, there have been a few reports where indirect ELISA using partially purified BToV or BEV particles were used for torovirus serodiagnosis, but purification procedures are not affordable by all laboratories and, in addition, this assay would also provide low sensitivity for detection of antibodies to human and porcine toroviruses (Brown et al., 1987). Torovirus serodiagnosis has also been performed by analyzing the ability of clinical serum samples to neutralize BEV infectivity (Weiss et al., 1984). The virus neutralization test is \u201ca priori\u201d a very sensitive assay that provides also information about the existence of a protective humoral immune response in the animal under study, however, since BEV, a non-homologous virus, would be used to search for antibodies to torovirus in cattle, human or swine sera, the sensitivity of the assay would be reduced. In addition seroneutralization test is a time-consuming and difficult assay that cannot be used to perform extensive studies.",

            "text": "Thus, alternative strategies have to be undertaken to generate torovirus specific antigens for immune detection. A frequently used alternative is the expression of immunologicaly relevant viral proteins in recombinant expression systems (Chirnside et al., 1995, Denac et al., 1997, Pelosi et al., 1999, Farkas et al., 2005, Bogdanova et al., 2007, Hou et al., 2007). For this purpose the nucleocapsid proteins from many viruses have proven to be very useful. Specifically, the N proteins of different coronaviruses including SARS have been expressed either in bacteria or through the baculovirus expression system and have been used for serodiagnosis (Timani et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2005). Moreover, the N protein is the most abundant protein in torovirus particles (Horzinek et al., 1985), and strong responses against it have been reported from experimental infections of gnobiotic calves with BToV (Duckmanton et al., 1998). Therefore, N protein from PToV appears as an interesting viral antigen to develop diagnostic methods. In addition, since the nucleocapsid proteins are usually highly conserved, serodiagnosis tests based on the use of PToV N protein may prove useful for detection of antibodies against other toroviruses.",

Briefly, 2 \u03bcl of PToV-BRES cDNA were added to a reaction mix containing 1\u00d7 high fidelity buffer, 200 \u03bcM of each dNTP, 200 nM of each primer and 0.71 U/\u03bcl of TripleMaster polymerase mix.

This method, that is a conventional procedure to determine neutralizing antibody titers for many viruses, has not been previously used for BEV. The reason being that BEV virus titers have always been determined by establishing the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) and neutralization assays were performed accordingly. Instead, we titrated BEV stocks by determining the number of pfu/ml (Garzon et al, unpublished results). Thus, BEV neutralization assay was performed as follows: 25 \u03bcl of heat inactivated diluted serum (two-fold serial dilutions in DMEM, from 1:4 to 1:4096) were incubated with an equal volume of a viral suspension containing 100 pfu of BEV for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C.

After removing the agar overlay, cells were stained with crystal violet and lysis plaques were counted. The virus-neutralizing titer (ND50) of each serum sample corresponds to the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution giving 50% reduction in the number of plaques with respect to that obtained with the virus without serum. Serum samples were tested by duplicate and negative (spf) and positive (CPS) control sera were included in each test. Neutralization titers were calculated using Spearman-K\u00e4rber formula.

One sample showed positive ELISA value (O.D.492nm\n = 1.30) and a neutralizing titer close to the cut-off (log ND50\n = 0.63) (Fig. 5A, arrow), however, it was positive by Western blot (Fig. 5A, strip 1). From the farm located in Galicia, more dispersed results were obtained by ELISA (O.D.492nm between 0.3 and 2.3), neutralization test (log ND50 between 0.5 and 3.2) and Western blot (Fig. 5B). All 15 serum samples were ELISA positive, and that result was confirmed by Western blot in 9 samples and by neutralization test in 14 samples. The only sample that was positive by ELISA (O.D492nm\n = 0.325) but negative by the other two tests (Fig. 5B, strip 13 and arrow) had a neutralizing titer that was close to the cut-off value (log ND50\n = 0.54). Serum samples from Aragon showed high titers of antibodies against PToV-N (O.D.492nm between 1.0 and 2.3), and accordingly, they were highly neutralizing (log ND50 between 1.5 and >3.2), and for some of them we could not determine the neutralizing titer since the highest serum dilution used, 1:4096, still reduces the number of viral plaques to more than 50%, and they were all positive by Western blot (Fig. 5C).",

Moreover, although HToV detection using ToVM5\u2032 and ToVM3\u2032 primer pairs has not been tested yet, these primers might also amplify HToV since they were designed in conserved regions from all torovirus M gene available sequences.

Genomic information about other PToV variants is needed to understand torovirus evolution and to develop new diagnostic tools. In this work we describe the amplification and sequencing of M, HE and N genes from PToV-BRES. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis of HE gene showed a high sequence homology (92%) with the HE gene from strain P4, but only 73\u201378% with other PToV strains. Two PToV lineages had previously been described based on HE gene sequences, which are represented by P4 and Markelo strains. It has been suggested that these two PToV lineages were generated by recombination events into the HE gene between a parental PToV and an unknown donor (Smits et al., 2003). PToV-P4 was detected in Italy in 1990, during an enteritis outbreak (Lavazza et al., 1996), and since then no other strains have shown a phylogenetic relationship with it. Therefore, P4 was considered as the likely PToV parental strain, and Markelo-like strains (Markelo, P78, P9 and P10) could then be considered as recombinant progeny originated from it. Our finding of a new PToV strain phylogenetically related to P4 in a sample collected in 2002 suggests that at least these two PToV lineages might be currently circulating in porcine populations. Antigenic differences between HE proteins from both PToV lineages have not been determined but this possibility should be considered. In this regard, antigenic differences between the known BToV lineages have been previously described (Smits et al., 2005).",

Antibodies against PToV were previously analyzed by BEV serum neutralization test (Weiss et al., 1984, Liebermann, 1990, Kroneman et al., 1998), however, this method is time consuming and its sensitivity could be compromised by the fact that it is based on cross-reactivity between torovirus species. Besides, two ELISA assays to detect antibodies against BToV and BEV have been previously reported. Both methods were developed using sucrose gradient purified virus, obtained either from faeces from gnobiotic calves infected with BToV (Brown et al., 1987, Van Kruiningen et al., 1992) or from culture medium from BEV infected cells (Weiss et al., 1984). However, these approaches cannot be applied to porcine torovirus, since PToV cannot be propagated in cell cultures yet, and no experimental infection protocol has been reported. Therefore, alternative strategies to obtain specific PToV antigens are needed.",

The torovirus nucleocapsid protein is the most abundant protein in the virions, and is highly antigenic as shown by the strong antibody response developed against it in gnobiotic calves experimentally infected with BToV. The N and HE proteins from BToV strain BRV-1 were expressed previously in E. coli (Duckmanton et al., 1998) and in insect cells (Duckmanton et al., 1999), respectively, and both proteins showed immunoreactivity to specific antisera and field serum samples by Western blot. However, these proteins were not used to develop any diagnostic assay. Therefore, we sought to use N protein from PToV as antigen to develop diagnostic methods. Thus, recombinant nucleocapsid protein from PToV-BRES isolate was expressed in insect cells and purified by affinity chromatography. Using this approach, large amounts of highly purified protein were achieved. Recombinant PToV-BRES-N protein was used to develop an ELISA assay to detect antibodies against torovirus in swine serum samples. Moreover, given the high degree of N protein conservation, the developed assay may also be useful to study the seroprevalence to bovine and even human toroviruses.",

Cross-reactivity of PToV with other related viruses infecting pigs has been discarded in the three assays tested (ELISA, Western blot and virus neutralization) and these results confirm that these viruses are serologically unrelated, and are in agreement with previous results described by other authors (Woode et al., 1982, Woode et al., 1985, Lamouliatte et al., 1987).

This prevalence rate is higher than others previously reported for PToV in The Netherlands (81%) using neutralization assay (Kroneman et al., 1998) and for BToV (Brown et al., 1987, Koopmans et al., 1989). However, these PToV prevalence rate data can only be considered as preliminary, since both, our, and the study performed in The Netherlands, were carried out with a short number of animals. Further epidemiological studies are needed to obtain definitive information regarding PToV prevalences in Spain and in other countries such as Italy, where PToV strains seem to normally circulate.",

Moreover, the nucleocapsid protein expressed by the baculovirus expression system could also be evaluated in immunization protocols to study its potential application for vaccination purposes against toroviruses. In this regard, protective responses elicited against the nucleocapsid protein have been reported for different coronaviruses (Wasmoen et al., 1995, Seo et al., 1997, Cavanagh, 2003). In addition, we have reported a new PToV strain and three genes coding for structural proteins have been fully sequenced providing information about torovirus evolution. This work contributes to increase our knowledge about this scarcely studied, but highly prevalent group of viruses, provides important tools for future studies, and presents, for the first time, preliminary evidences on the presence of antibodies to torovirus in Spanish livestock.",
