            "text": "interactions. Although the phagocytic functions of isolated M8 from kittens and adults were equivalent, the mean FeLV susceptibility of M8 from kittens was five times that of M8 from adult cats, thus establishing a direct correlation between the agerelated susceptibility of cats and M8 from cats to FeLV. M8 of viremic cats were found to be infected with FeLV in vivo; virus titers were slightly higher than those obtained after in vitro infection of M8. M8 from cats that had experienced regressive Fe LV infection were not significantly more resistant to FeLV infection in vitro than were M8 from naive adult specific-pathogen-free cats. HC, which has been shown to enhance the in vivo FeLV susceptibility of cats, also enhanced the permissiveness of M8 from cats to FeLV in vitro (600-fold for M8 from adult cats and 200-fold for M8) from kittens. M8 permissiveness to FeL V was highly sensitive to HC and occurred in M8 infected in vivo or in vitro. In parallel with the effect of HC on the natural resistance of cats to FeLV, administration of silica before virus inoculation also markedly enhanced the FeLV susceptibility of adult cats. Silica was toxic for isolated M8 but not for lymphocytes in vitro, and silica produced monocytopenia and neutrophilia, delayed skin allograft rejection, and augmented feline oncovirus-associated cell membrane antigen antibody responses in vivo. These experiments indicate that M8 were linked to the natural resistance of cats to FeLV and that the temporary elimination of M8 functions (e.g., by silica) and/or the conversion of the M8-FeLV relationship from a non permissive to a permissive state (e.g., by corticosteroids) resulted in failure of early virus containment, in persistent virus amplification in hemolymphatic tissues, and in subsequent Fe LVrelated proliferative or anti proliferative disease.-JNCI 1981; 67: 889-898. FeLV is transmitted by contact of susceptible cats with virus excreted in salivary and respiratory secretions of persistently infected cats (1) (2) (3) (4) . Whether lymphosarcoma, leukemia, or anti proliferative disease such as aplastic anemia occurs after virus exposure is determined by the cat's ability to contain FeLV replication in target hemolymphatic tissues in the first few weeks after Fe LV exposure (5, 6) . The capacity for early lymphoreticular restriction of FeLV is deficient in immature cats (5, 7) and can be abrogated in adult cats by treatment with adrenal corticosteroid (8) or by exposure to the immunosuppressive chemical carcinogen methylnitrosourea (9) . It is plausible that the interaction of Me with FeLV and with Ie determines whether progressive infection and leukemogenesis or regressive infection and elimination of FeLV -infected cells occur (5, 6) . On the basis of this premise and observations in mICe that demonstrate the obligatory role of mononuclear phagocytes in age-related resistance to viral infections (10) (11) (12) and to grafts of normal or neoplastic hemolymphatic cells (13) (14) (15) , we have investigated the involvement of feline Me in the pathogenesis of FeL V infection.",

Feline MO, although relatively refractory to in vitro FeLV infection as compared with sensitive (but more artificial) host cells such as fibroblasts, still are more permissive than are feline Ie (21) . In the Friend virus system, Marcelletti and Furmanski (43) found that resident and thioglycollate-induced adult mouse peritoneal MO were highly resistant to viral infection either in vitro or after transfer to the peritoneal cavity of viremic progressor mice. The proportion of MO capable of entering DNA synthesis in a population greatly influenced permissiveness to F-MuLV infection (41) . Addition of MO colony-stimulating factor was required for the induction of productive infection in 0.03-0.1% of mouse peritoneal MO (41) . In our present studies with thioglycollate-elicited feline MO, no specific growth-stimulating factors were added, yet cell-associated FeL V infectivity was induced in up to 0.1-0.3% of the inoculated MO. In our earlier experiments (47) , less favorable culture conditions produced lower indices of MO infection; however, a greater divergence was observed between virus susceptibility of MO from kittens versus those from adult cats, which suggests that suboptimal culture conditions are more sensitive in discriminating age-related differences in MO viral susceptibility.",

This finding implies that enhanced FeLV production was related not merely to increased numbers of cells entering the mitotic cycle, but probably also to 'an increase in number of MO infected or an increased production of viral progeny by infected M8. Because feline MO were quite sensitive to HC (concentrations as low as 10-8 M being effective), cortisol levels obtainable under physiologic conditions could conceivably alter MO FeLV susceptibility sufficiently to be responsible for the empirically observed effect (Hoover EA: Unpublished observations) of stress on the FeLV resistance of cats. Studies in mice have shown that both physiologic stress and administration of cortisone produce comparable impairment of MO tumoricidal capacity (49) .",

The epigenetic resistance of chicken MO to avian leukosis viruses appears to reflect lack of the cellular receptor function responsible for facilitating viral penetration because the adsorption of restricted (A, D, G) and unrestricted (B, C) subgroup viruses to MO is equivalent (44) . Whether the virus envelope-cell receptor interactions responsible for restriction of avian leukosis virus by MO could be abolished by glucocorticoid treatment of M8 would be of interest. Corticosteroids appear to produce relatively little effect on the replication of ecotropic MuLV in permissive mouse cells (50) (51) (52) but to enhance substantially the replication of 1) ecotropic MuLV in nonproductively infected mouse embryo cells (51) (52) (53) (54) , 2) ecotropic FeLV in nonproductively infected human embryo cells (55) , and 3) xenotropic MuLV (53, 54) and FeLV (19) in heterologous cells. Cell transformation by defective murine and feline sarcoma viruses also is enhanced by corticosteroids, possibly through augmented helper leukemia virus replication in target cells (19, 55, 57) . Thus available information concerning glucocorticoids and retrovirus expression supports the tenet that HC enhances the FeLV susceptibility of cats by converting the M8-FeLV relationship from a nonpermissive state that leads to early virus containment and initiation of immune response to a permissive state that results in early viral amplification, virus-mediated immunosuppression, persistent viral infection, and leukemogenesis.",

            "text": "Although glucocorticoid receptors on MO appear abundant (46) , information concerning the effect of glucocorticoids on isolated MO is relatively limited. In contrast to the effects of HC on feline MO, corticosteroid treatment of mouse peritoneal MO has been reported to inhibit MO proliferation and protein synthesis (58) and to have variable effects on bacterial phagocytosis and killing (59, 60) . The proliferative capacity for long-term survival, lipogenesis, and sustenance of hematopoiesis by murine bone marrow MO, however, is increased by HC (61, 62) . Likewise, we have found that proliferation, survival, lipogenesis, and The incidence (55%) and magnitude (mean titer= 1:59) of FOCMA antibody titers that accompanied the induction of persistent viremia in silica-treated, FeLVexposed, viremic cats were more than tenfold greater than those observed in viremic cats in previous experiments by us and others (1-3, 7, 24, 64, 65) . This finding suggests that short-term MO removal by silica facilitated the induction of persistent viremia and that the subsequent adjuvant effect of silica (66) may have amplified the capacity for FOCMA antibody production, which has been shown to be present at least transiently in many viremic cats. In rodents, silica administration has been shown to enhance antibody response concomitant with regenerative hyperplasia of the mononuclear phagocytes after silica-induced depletion (66) (67) (68) . A similar, though less dramatic, pattern in FOCMA antibody responses occurred in 29% of viremic adult cats given low doses of methylprednisolone before FeL V inoculation (8) . The feasibility exists, therefore, that either reduction of the silica dose below that used in our present studies or prolongation of the interval between silica and Fe LV administration would augment rather than impair FeL V resistance. In this regard, experiments examining the effect of the administration of MO-stimulating substances, such as glucan or pyran copolymer, to kittens before R-FeLV challenge are in progress.",

The susceptibility of Me from FeLV-exposed nonviremic adult cats to FeLV infection in vitro was similar to that observed previously for Me from naive adult cats (table 5). In both instances, FeLV infection was enhanced by HC treatment in vitro (table 5). Thus we concluded that the level of productive FeLV in peritoneal Me derived from viremic cats approximated that obtained after in vitro infection and that previous self-limiting FeLV infection did not render Me resistant to reinfection. of systemic Me impairment on resistance of cats to FeLV.-Because the above in vitro experiments and previous in vivo experiments suggested that the age-related resistance of cats to FeL V correlated with early viral replication versus containment of FeL V by Me, we investigated whether temporary elimination of Me in vivo would impair FeLV resistance.

Pretreatment of mice with silica or carrageenan enhances susceptibility to F-MuLV and R-MuLV infection, respectively (36, 37). Both spontaneous and statolon-induced regression of Friend erythroleukemia is dependent on MO function and inhibited by systemic MO toxins (37, 39, 63). Therefore, MO can plausibly act in cats both as effector cells against FeL V -replicating cells and as initiators of the immune response through antigen presentation and other Ie cooperation mechanisms (Rojko JL, Hoover EA, Finn BL, Olsen RE: Unpublished data).",
