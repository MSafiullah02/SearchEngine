However, cumulative evidence has shown that the use of NIV has markedly increased over the past few decades and that NIV has become an integral tool in the management of acute RF [10\u221215]. In the present study, we investigated the trend in the use of NIV and IMV, the baseline characteristics of NIV and IMV users, the associated discharge diagnoses of NIV and IMV users, and the mortality of NIV and IMV users during their first episode of acute RF in a population in Taiwan.",

A t test was carried out to determine the differences in mean age between the two study groups. The odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for NIV and NIV-associated factors were estimated by logistic regression. The model 1 was adjusted for age group, gender, hospital level, and CCI and the model 2 was adjusted for age group, gender, hospital level, and comorbidities. Furthermore, we calculated the distribution of the most prevalent associated discharge diagnoses in the NIV group and compared with the IMV group by logistic regression. Finally, the rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs of mortality at discharge and within 90 days for the NIV group were compared with those for the IMV group by Poisson regression. The model was adjusted for age group, gender, hospital level, and CCI. Additionally, we performed another overall matched method for mortality comparison (propensity score matching based on age, gender, hospital level, and CCI). All analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05 of two-tailed tests.",

Stratified analysis for the presence of cancer history showed that patients with cancer in the NIV group had a higher mortality rate at discharge (77.4% vs. 62.6%) and within 90 days (89.7% vs. 76.2%) than patients with cancer in the IMV group. However, no difference was observed in the mortality rate of non-cancer patients who had received NIV and IMV treatment. To validate the results, we additionally performed propensity score matching based on age, gender, hospital level, and CCI for mortality comparison (N = 1188 in NIV group and N = 4752 in IMV group, lower part in Table 4). Similarly, we observed that patients in the NIV group had a significantly higher overall mortality rate at discharge than those in the IMV group. Patients with cancer in the NIV group had a higher mortality rate at discharge and within 90 days than patients with cancer in the IMV group. No difference was observed in the mortality rate of non-cancer patients who had received NIV and IMV treatment.",

The indications for NIV have also been extended, such as for immunocompromised patients and patients with chest trauma, post-operative lung resection, community-acquired pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and terminal stage diseases (palliative care) [7\u20139, 18].

In this study, the extremely elderly and patients with cancer comprised a very high proportion (52.0% of those aged \u2265 80 years and 25.8% of those with a history of cancer) of NIV users, and cancer occupied the second place among the associated discharge diagnoses in NIV users. This phenomenon may be influenced by the administration of palliative care for individuals with extremely old age and advanced stage of cancer [19\u201322]. Palliative NIV could be administered either to offer a chance for survival or to alleviate the symptoms of respiratory distress in terminally ill patients [19]. The use of NIV in patients with dyspnea in terminal states remains controversial, but it is reportedly effective in reducing dyspnea and in decreasing the dose of morphine in palliative use in patients with end-stage cancer [21]. One of the primary benefits of using NIV in this setting is the preservation of communication between the patient and the family. This technique is also widely used in patients with acute RF and in a DNR order, particularly for the extremely elderly [22]. Unfortunately, information on the number of persons who had DNR orders or received hospice care was absent from the database. The role or exact proportion of palliative NIV in all NIV users should be clarified in further research.",

We further conducted a stratified analysis of the presence of cancer history and found that patients with cancer who had received NIV treatment had a much higher mortality rate than patients who had received IMV treatment. By contrast, no difference was found in the mortality rates of patients without cancer between the NIV and IMV groups. This finding supported our hypothesis because palliative NIV was applied in a considerable number of patients with and without cancer.

Some people may have repeated episodes of acute RF and would have received different opinions regarding treatment. Second, we excluded the overlapping use of NIV and IMV as we could not differentiate the time sequence of NIV and IMV use in the database. Clinically, IMV can be used after NIV for the management of disease progression, and NIV can be used after IMV for post-extubation support. Third, the cause of acute RF was unavailable in the database. We attempted to apply associated discharge diagnoses to overcome this limitation, but only minimal success was achieved. We could only categorize these associated diagnoses into four groups: possible cause of RF, comorbidity, co-existing acute illness, and uncertain acute or chronic condition. Fourth, disease severity such as the degree of hypoxemia and hypercapnia and the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) score were unavailable. The APACHE score is associated with patients\u2019 prognosis and in-hospital mortality [24]. We could only collect CCI data to represent the overall degree of severity. Finally, we were unable to identify patients with DNR orders or who received palliative and hospice care. Therefore, the results of the present study must be interpreted with caution.",
