            "text": "Enterprise Architecture (EA) has had an interesting and often controversial history since its inception in the late 80's by pioneers such as John Zachman. Zachman proposed the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture (ZFEA), a descriptive, holistic representation of an enterprise for the purposes of providing insights and understanding. Some scholars claim that EA is an imperative to ensure successful business structures or business-IT alignment, or more recently with Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM), to manage required organizational transformation. However, EA initiatives within companies are often costly and the expected return on investment is not realized. In fact, Gartner recently indicated in their 2018 Enterprise Architecture Hype Cycle that EA is slowly emerging from the trough of disillusionment after nearly a decade. In this paper we argue that the role and value of EA is often misunderstood, and that EA, specifically the ZFEA for the purpose of this paper, could be considered as a theory given the view of theory within Information Systems (IS). The purpose of IS theories is to analyse, predict, explain and/or prescribe and it could be argued that EA often conform to these purposes. Using the taxonomy of theories as well as the structural components of theory within IS as proposed by Gregor, we motivate that the ZFEA could be regarded as an explanatory theory. Positioning ZFEA as IS explanatory theory provides insight into the role and purpose of the ZFEA (and by extension EA), and could assist researchers and practitioners with mediating the challenges experienced when instituting EA and EAM initiatives within organizations.",

Similar to the method used by Gregor to evaluate five types of theory in IS, we evaluate the ZFEA [28] . By establishing whether ZFEA, and by extension, EA in general, could be regarded as IS theories, we believe that insight on what function EA should fulfil, as well as the use and position of EA and its frameworks and tools, specifically given the strategic developments such as EAM, could be enhanced.",

            "text": "EA originally developed from the need to align the business and information technology aspects of the organisation with one another [12] , but has since advanced to be viewed from more than one perspective and for more than one application [10] . EA developed from more than one discipline with differing terminology, seeking mostly similar goals such as organisational alignment, integration, and ability to understand and manage complexity and change [16, 29] . Several definitions for EA exist, such as that EA is the continuous practice of describing the essential elements of a sociotechnical organization, their relationships to each other and to the environment, in order to understand complexity and manage change [30] . Urbaczewski and Mrdalj defined EA as a description or blueprint that defines the day-to-day operation and structure of an organization [3] , and Zachman himself defined EA as a set of descriptive representations relevant to the enterprise [31] . EA is directed at ensuring that the business with its technologies and resources, as well as the current and future purposes of the organization are aligned. Since its inception, several different EA frameworks were developed from different perspectives and disciplines. Due to space limitations, we will mostly focus on the ZFEA, however, several works on the history, evolution, purpose of, and recent developments within EA are included as references [3, 12, 13, 16, 17, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . In Sect. 4 we analyse the grounding of the EA discipline to motivate the choice of the ZFEA for this paper, and in the next section a short overview of ZFEA is provided.",

Borrowing from the field of engineering, Zachman described how insight into different disciplines and the manufacturing process contributed to the ZFEA [1, 40] . Zachman describes the breakthrough that led to his now well-known ZFEA as the realisation of the existence of different perspectives relevant to a product, which he then applied to an enterprise [39] . The ZFEA was designed after observing that various engineered objects such as computers, buildings and airplanes (the designed artefacts) can be classified according to the fundamental abstractions or interrogatives namely What? How? Where? Who? When? Why?, in columns (Table 1) , as well as specific audience perspectives and transformations in rows ( Table 2 ) [1] . The ZFEA (Fig. 1) , is therefore a 6 \u00c2 6 twodimensional classification schema for designing descriptive representations of the enterprise. The ZFEA is also described as an enterprise ontology with no process or tooling implications [41] , or a meta-model of an enterprise represented in a matrix comprised of columns and rows. Each intersection of a column and row provides a unique representation or view of the enterprise [1] . ",

An understanding of the origins and the thinking underpinning EA has relevance for this paper as it provides the foundation for EA concepts and frameworks, and provides the motivation for using the ZFEA as representative of the structural and ontological aspects of EA in general. Le Roux [47] adopted the approach of Baskerville and Dulipovici [48] to investigate the theoretical grounding of EA, and indicated that the theoretical base for EA emerged from more than one field. The results of this analysis are summarised in Table 5 . These results support the legitimacy of the discipline and support the use of EA as a theoretical base. If the ZFEA is a representative of this theoretical underpinning, we could motivate the use of the ZFEA for this paper. Table 5 . Summary of works relating to EA origins and their basis of argument Author Basis from which the underlying business problems of alignment, control, efficiency and management of change are addressed Taylor [49] The business system would have to be placed before the individual, and that scientific management was needed to ensure this is possible. Efficiency through interaction of individuals. Organisation as a holistic entity. Holistic system before the individual Shewhart [50] From industrial engineering emphasized organizational control to enable adaption. Past experience and process Forrester [51] Motivate an underlying base to understand the business system as a whole for organizational management. Discuss the elements of the organisation and interactions between elements Drucker [52] Business management motivation that argue for system as a whole broken into elements, as well as the interactions between elements Blumenthal [53] Holistic systems planning to adapt to change, focus on IT systems within organisations. Underlying elements and interaction between elements is an enablement factor. Proposed a framework for planning Helfert [54] Financial management perspective emphasizes resource flows with a holistic platform/system from which to understand flows. The organisation is the complete set of individual resource flows Anthony [55] A business system consists of diverse individual parts that all contribute to or serve a specific purpose. Framework to understand organisational concepts and their contribution Senge [56] Emphasizes the system as a whole, with 5 elements of technology that are interdependent, and the interrelationships of system elements.

According to Gregor it is required to look at the primary goals of the theory in order to classify it [28] . The ZFEA is a structural representation or an ontology of an organization and all its elements with their relationships that is descriptive in nature.

The architecture of a specific enterprise that was developed using the ZFEA schema or ontology would necessarily constitute the total set of descriptive representations that are relevant for describing the enterprise Theory Given the results of the analyses, the conclusion can be made that the ZFEA could be regarded as an explanatory theory. An explanatory theory aims to provide an understanding on how, when and why an occurrence took place based on causality and argumentation. The ZFEA is aligned as its intent is to provide insights into the how, when and why of an enterprise. The ZFEA is represented in the form of a framework in order to provide a holistic view, but at the same time provides insights given specific perspectives. Each row, column and cell in the architecture is impacted by another e.g. the technology supports the business processes, the business processes the applications and the applications the strategy. Changes in any model will have an effect on the other models. Changes in strategy (cause) for example, will have an impact (effect) on the rest of the enterprise. All components form part of the whole to provide context. The scope is defined by the subset or component being designed. The ZFEA is described as an ontology and a structural schema that aims to be a repeatable and testable description of an enterprise. It can be argued that the main goals of the ZFEA is aligned to the goals of an explanatory theory since both aim to provide insight, understanding and causal explanations, as well as indicate relationships among components.",

The paper firstly discussed the need for EA and how the need for a descriptive representation of an enterprise stems from multiple disciplines. Based on the origins of EA, it is clear that EA was initially developed for the purpose of fulfilling the strategic need for a holistic representation of an enterprise that can be used as a common guideline to understand and compare organizations. The paper addressed certain criticisms pertaining to the origins, Does not conform: Statements of relationships between constructs that are stated in such a form that they can be tested empirically are not present. Zachman states that the model should not be applied deterministically but that it is an ontology that is repeatable and testable (such as the periodic table), however, there is not yet evidence of the ZFEA being implemented in such a way. An explanatory theory typically do not conform to this component Prescriptive statements",

This is somewhat supported by the ZFEA as the purpose of the ZFEA is to model an enterprise by using the interrogatives and perspectives, however, detailed process or method is not supported. An explanatory theory typically do not conform to this component purpose and functionality of EA. EA, specifically the ZFEA, is often misunderstood, as it is not a methodology and does not provide steps on the implementation of an architecture. Many different Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (EAF) addressing different business needs are available for use today, but for the purposes of this paper the framework of choice was the ZFEA. The ZFEA is an ontology and a two-dimensional schema aimed at providing a descriptive representation of a complex object [31] . As mentioned, the ZFEA's primary purpose is to provide a holistic understanding, thus supporting the argument of ZFEA serving as an explanatory IS theory.",

As stated by Gregor, 'theory allows for different perspectives and aims to enhance our understanding of the world by providing explanations, descriptions, predictions and actionable guidance'. Positioning the ZFEA as IS theory provides insight into the role and purpose of EA and could assist researchers and practitioners with addressing challenges experienced when instituting EA and EAM initiatives within organizations. EA as an explanatory IS theory for organisations also present a new platform, context and therefore perspective, for focussed strategic organisational research. Further research would extend the analysis of EA as IS theory to other frameworks, as well as explore the implications when using EA as theory. We furthermore want to investigate whether the ZFEA as meta-ontology for enterprises, may be considered as a meta-theory for organisational research.",
