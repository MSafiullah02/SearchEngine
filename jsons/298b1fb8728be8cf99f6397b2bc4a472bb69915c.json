In this study, we used iTRAQ labeling coupled with LC-MS/MS for quantitative identification of differentially expressed proteins in BTV-infected sheep testicular (ST) cells. Relative quantitative data were obtained for 4455 proteins in BTVand mock-infected ST cells, among which 101 and 479 proteins were differentially expressed at 24 and 48 h post-infection, respectively, indicating further proteomic changes during the later stages of infection. Ten corresponding genes of differentially expressed proteins were validated via real-time RT-PCR. Expression levels of three representative proteins, eIF4a1, STAT1 and HSP27, were further confirmed via western blot analysis. Bioinformatics analysis disclosed that the differentially expressed proteins are primarily involved in biological processes related to innate immune response, signal transduction, nucleocytoplasmic transport, transcription and apoptosis. Several upregulated proteins were associated with the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and endocytosis.

Furthermore, virus titer was continuously increased in infected cells until 48 h, at which time we observed the highest viral load. At 72 hpi, all infected cells showed rounding and granular degeneration. BTV infection can terminate host protein expression in the late stage. Thus, to avoid detecting changes in host protein expression caused by interference with translation, proteomic analyses were performed on cells at early infection time-points (24 and 48 hpi). Some viruses, if passaged at MOI>1, accumulate spontaneously deleted defective particles that are maintained during passage by the presence of complementing wild-type helper virus [39] . For proteome profiling, although most cells could be infected under high MOI (such as MOI of 1), the levels of most host proteins would be nonspecifically reduced by translational repression or strongly affected by BTV-induced apoptosis. To avoid the changes in protein expression profiles masked by BTV-induced translational shutoff and apoptotic effects, ST cells were infected with BTV at a MOI of 0.1, rather than higher MOI.

It also shapes the adaptive immune response generated by both T and B cells. Production of IFN in response to virus infection is triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by the infected cell. Activation of innate cellular responses during viral infection requires recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors [36, 40, 41] . The genome of BTV, composed of dsRNA molecules, has been described as a potent inducer of type I IFN, both in vivo and in vitro. Recent studies have shown that BTV triggers type I IFN production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells via a MYD88-dependent/TLR7/8independent sensing and signaling pathway whereas cytoplasmic helicases (RIG-1, MDA5) mediate sensing and signaling in BTV-infected epithelial cells [42, 43] . However, pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways and the mechanisms responsible for production of IFN in response to BTV are still not completely understood. Type I IFN binds to a common IFN-\u2423/\u2424 receptor (IFNAR), initiating a signaling cascade that results in expression of hundreds of interferonstimulated genes (ISG). ISGs are key components of the host innate immune response and serve as the first line of defense against viral infection. In our study, 18 upregulated ISG proteins were identified. Among these, interferon-inducible ISG15, ISG20, Mx1, Mx2, RSAD2, OAS1 and OAS2, have been documented as critical antiviral proteins in cells and animals [44, 45] .

DDX58 (RIG-1) plays an important role in the recognition of RNA viruses in various cells, and has been identified as a candidate cytoplasmic viral dsRNA receptor [47] . In the current study, we demonstrated that BTV infection induces overexpression of a number of antiviral proteins, several of which were identified for the first time, including ISG15, ISG20, Mx1, Mx2, RSAD2, OAS1, OAS2, IFI44 and IFIT [36, 48] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 560, "end": 564, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 565, "end": 568, "text": "40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 569, "end": 572, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 979, "end": 983, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 984, "end": 987, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1653, "end": 1657, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1661, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1812, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 1981, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2224, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2225, "end": 2228, "text": "48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We additionally confirmed upregulation of STAT1, HSP27 and eIF4a1 via qRT-PCR and western blot analyses.

HSP, also known as stress proteins, are often involved in antigen presentation and intracellular trafficking and apoptosis, and act as molecular chaperones by helping nascent polypeptides assume their proper conformations. HSP27 is linked to different signaling pathways that regulate cellular functions, such as inflammation, apoptosis, development, differentiation and cell growth. In addition, many other viruses, including avian influenza H9N2 [50] , infectious bursal disease virus [21] , and African swine fever virus [51] , induce upregulation of HSP27. eIF4A1 was initially characterized based on its requirement in translation and later identified as a component of the eIF4F translation initiation complex responsible for RNA helicase activity [52] .
