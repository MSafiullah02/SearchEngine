            "text": "As the COVID-19 outbreak is developing the two most frequently reported statistics seem to be the raw confirmed case and case fatalities counts. Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread. In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region) generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region) 15 th -22 nd March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort. This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model parameters for this virus's dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are taking place at the regional level. These findings are based on the official data of total death counts up to 15 th April 2020 released by ISTAT and up to 10 th May 2020 for the number of cases. In this work we do not fit models but we rather investigate whether this task is possible at all.",

SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be transmitted mostly by close contact (and further carry-over to the mucous surfaces of the body) and inhalation of aerosol produced by an infected person. The presence of the virus was also reported in samples from the gastrointestinal tract but the potential role of the oral-fecal route of infection is unknown. The evidence of asymptomatic carriers who may unintentionally transmit the virus together with relatively long incubation period up to 24 days (Bai et al., 2020) increase the risk of viral spread worldwide and make prevention measures difficult. On the other hand, separation of identified cases, prior immunity to SARS-CoV-2 or cross-reactivity of human antibodies naturally risen against other viruses would act as a barrier for virus transmission. The latter is probable as RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are in 79% identical to the sequences of SARS-CoV responsible for the previous pandemic in Far East countries in 2002 and 50% identical to MERS-CoV (Lu et al., 2020) . All above mentioned issues would act as confounding factors for any modelling of pandemic progression.",

As such a great number of people were locked in a confined space using common facilities, air-condition systems, restaurants etc. and once the chronology of infections, symptoms and undertaken health measures are known (Nakazawa et al., 2020; Rockl\u00f6v et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) , one can consider this as a unique, naturallyoccurring epidemiological study useful for prediction of mortality, disease spread and other parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the virus has spread across the world and new pandemic epicenters like Italy, Spain, Iran, South Korea and USA have emerged, a multitude of new data has appeared. Different countries have applied different strategies of testing people for the coronavirus (mass testing vs. testing of selected patients), different testing methods (serological vs. PCR-based assays) and count of case fatalities (solely SARS-CoV-2 positive tested cases vs. cases with comorbidities). Therefore, any direct comparison of pandemic dynamics is difficult but still, comparison to a \"golden standard\", which the Diamond Princess case could be considered as, may be useful.",

They are usually concerned with connecting the pandemic with various epidemiological models (e.g. Kumar and Hembram (2020) ; Morais (2020) ; Singer (2020); Zullo (2020) following a brief survey of arXiv at the start of April 2020). However, such models of course require data concerning the infected individuals. Furthermore, the media are bombarding today with two basic numbers (for each country)-the number of confirmed cases and the number of case fatalities. Given that supposedly the vast majority of people are asymptomatic and testing is not done as random sampling of the population but due to particular protocols these values by themselves might be misleading. We can only second Wood (2020) in \"Despite millions of tests having been performed, there are still no results from statistically well founded sampling based testing programmes to establish basic epidemic quantities such as infection fatality rate and infection rates. In the absence of such direct data, epidemic management has to proceed on the basis of data produced largely as a side effect of the clinical response to the disease.\" As a motivating example we present Figure 1 from which we can see that in Italy the case fatality to confirmed ratio is constant while the confirmed cases to number of tests has been decreasing since around March 22 nd . Indeed, the time period since March 22 nd is longer than the median time of 19.5 days of infection till death , so one should already start observing some drop in the case fatality to confirmed ratio.",

Furthermore, any deceased whose test result is found positive is classified as a COVID-19 case fatality, regardless of any past or underlying diseases, and this methodology has been consistently applied in Italy since the beginning (Picariello and Aliani, 2020) . It is important to point out that different countries seem to have different testing strategies and classification systems of deaths-hence raw counts between countries might not be comparable. Given the huge amount of tests performed in Italy (2735628 as of 13 th May 2020 (COVD19 package), Guidotti and Ardia, 2020) an important question is: \"what fraction of them were serological tests?\" as there is no official data on this. A serological test may not distinguish between a person actively infected with the virus and a person that was exposed to the virus in the past. Alternatively, serological test may not detect person actively infected with still low viral titer of anti-virus antibodies. On the other hand, if the protocol is to test only people exhibiting symptoms and medical personnel, then given that it is hypothesised that the vast majority of cases are asymptomatic, such a raw count might not be representative of the scale of the epidemic.",

To the best of our knowledge such statistics are not centrally reported in Italy in real-time. Daily deceased counts (from nearly all of the Italian municipalities-see Discussion) are available though for the period 1 st January-15 th April 2020 2 . Hence, for this time period we are able to plot the weakly \"nearly\"-desired ratios (see Section 4). We aggregate per week to remove daily fluctuations, which obscure the picture. Furthermore, the same data source provides deceased counts for the years 2015-2019 (for the same time period). This allows us to also visualize the excess mortality (with respect to the per week average from the past five years). Beyond this time interval, it is impossible to provide such curves. However, having daily case fatalities counts and past mortality (this is taken as a constant value equalling the average number of deceased for 15 th April) we are able to plot the (per week) ratio of case fatalities to previous average mortality. This provides some indication of the magnitude of excess mortality 3 . However, it is worth noticing that when looking at the current excess mortality it could be appropriate to compare with past mortality peaks (e.g. for UK death toll, the 2014/2015 and 1999/2000 peaks 4 , Figs. 1, 5 and 6 of Thomas, 2020) , taking into consideration the causes of death. Here for Italy and its regions, in Figs. 4, 6 and Fig. 28 in Appendix B we compare the current deceased peak with the seasonal start of the January one.",

We obtain data for the period 24 th February-10 th May 2020 and we plot the curves from the moment of the first death. From both Figure 2 and 3 (and those present in the Appendix A) we can notice a number of facts. Firstly the daily fraction of infected cases fluctuates very wildly and sometimes can be greater than 1. This can only be due to some changes in protocols or reporting. Similarly, such an explanation seems plausible for the fluctuations in the fractions. In fact, Picariello and Aliani (2020) report a change in the way positive cases and deaths are calculated on 10 th March. The cumulative case fraction on the other hand does not exhibit such fluctuations. For most regions it is flat and then decreasing. In a number of regions (e.g. Abruzzo, Basilicata, Campania, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lazio, Molise, Puglia, Sardegna, Sicily, Toscana, Umbria, Veneto) on the log-scale graphs the cumulative case to tests ratio curve seems the peak around or below the Diamond Princess' cumulative case curve and then start dropping. The scaled death curves exceed this curve. When looking at the graphs of the number of tests per day two things can be seen. Firstly, the number of positive cases closely follows the number of tests (this is clearly visible on the log-scale graphs and supported by the regression study). We look at this issue in detail and present for each region and Italy the confirmed cases with respect to the total tests carried out. We also regress the log(daily confirmed cases) \u2212 log(daily total tests) on time (in days) and log(cumulative confirmed cases) \u2212 log(cumulative total tests) on time (in days). The slope of such a regression can be presented in terms of the half-lives, if it is negative. Such a presentation in terms of effect sizes is important, otherwise it is difficult to assess if the raw slope is big or small. The linear model approach means that the proportion of infected behaves exponentially (daily(cumulative) confirmed cases)) / (daily(cumulative) total tests)) =: p(t) = be at , then to get the half-life (for a negative, t 2 > t 1 ) one takes",

It is important to point out that this is a rather rule-of-thumb approach-our aim is not to model the dynamics of infections, but rather to visualize and understand what the data in front of us is. These regressions were not performed from the first day, as initially there seems to be a lot of noise in the tests, the starting time considered is visible in each graph-where the fitted line with prediction confidence band is fitted. We performed a regression for both the daily and cumulative counts. For some regions (Molise, Valle d'Aosta) no regression is performed as the daily counts seem to noisy. Secondly, one can very clearly identify days when something must have changed due to the testing methodology in the Emilia Romagna region-there are huge dips in the numbers of tests performed. Hence, for this region the dates 28 th -30 th March were removed for the regression estimation. In the Basilicata and Calabria regions spikes to 0 can also be observed-these are also removed, as on the log scale would result in infinite values which cannot be handled by the regression procedure in lm().

This is confirmed when looking at the log-scale plot. The difference between the logarithm of the cumulative number of tests and the logarithm of the cumulative number of confirmed seems to be (visually) dropping linearly (apart from the below, extremely noisy ones) regions and Italy as a whole. Furthermore, for a number of regions (Molise, Valle d'Aosta), on the log scale, the tests, total, positive and difference behave very chaotically, suggesting rather various test handling situations, than any pattern. Such oscillations can be visible in all regions at the initial stages, but they settle down (apart from the previously mentioned three regions). However, in regions with seemingly well-behaved curves individual huge dips can be observed (Emilia-Romagna, Marche).

Here, there is hardly any chance of missing asymptomatic (of being dead) people. If the assumption, mentioned in the Introduction, that a significant proportion of the tests are serological is true, then the ratio of case fatalities to all deceased should be telling us something about the cumulative proportion of infected individuals. Our graphs (especially on the log-scale) do not contradict this, while the cumulative proportion of confirmed cases changes very slowly, the ratio of case fatalities to total deceased per day seems to look like an epidemic growth curve. Since Italy has very high quality data on the case fatalities, this data could be further studied to assess the dynamics of the pandemic (e.g. Morais (2020) uses the raw death counts for assessing the dynamics of the pandemic, albeit at the country level). This seems to be supported by that if one compares the curves to a potential \"gold standard\"-the cumulative fraction of confirmed cases on the Diamond Princess, then the case fatalities ratio seems to shadow this curve (on the initial part when the epidemic was taking place on the cruise ship and for some regions like Emilia-Romagna or Lombardia) but exceeds it. One could hope that once all curves would flatten at the same level, then the epidemic will reach the plateau.

Combined Italy shows a visible increase in the death toll during the March-April period compared to previous years and the seasonal December/January peak.
