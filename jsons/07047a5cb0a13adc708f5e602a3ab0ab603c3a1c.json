In 2014 a phase III clinical trial of adult IPS, etanercept did not provide additional benefit over steroids alone, though enrollment in this trial was prematurely ended and definitive conclusions regarding use of etanercept in IPS cannot be made from this trial alone. Notably, etanercept use was not associated with increased risk of opportunistic infection or malignancy relapse compared with placebo controls. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use has been reported in both early and late IPS, though its efficacy and impact on outcomes is unclear [58, 59] .
