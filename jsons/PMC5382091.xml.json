A recent CIBMTR (Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry) analysis comparing the outcomes of adult MDS patients undergoing a sibling or adult matched unrelated donor (MUD) HCT receiving MA or RIC highlighted diminished survival, increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) and increased incidence of severe acute GVHD (aGVHD) with unrelated donors compared with siblings.10 In contrast, a European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) analysis of 1333 MDS patients aged >50 years receiving either a sibling or MUD donor transplant revealed similar 4-year survival at approximately 31% with advanced disease at HCT the primary variable impacting survival but increased NRM with unrelated donor source.11",

Registry data provide the largest cohorts of patients for such outcome analyses comparing alternative donor HCT in MDS. Robin et al.12 presented the first large report evaluating outcomes of UCB HCTs in MDS on behalf of Eurocord and EBMT comparing patients with either MDS (n=39) or AML secondary to MDS (n=69) undergoing MA or RIC UCB. They reported 2-year overall survival (OS) of 34%, 2 year disease-free survival (DFS) of 30% and 2-year incidence of relapse of 21%. Severe aGVHD grades III\u2013IV occurred in approximately 11%, 2-year chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 42% and NRM was high at 49%. NRM was adversely influenced by MA conditioning and a longer time from diagnosis to transplantation. Although this study was the first to report a larger cohort of patients undergoing UCB transplant for MDS, the number of patients with true MDS in this cohort was small and the patient population and transplant approaches were heterogeneous owing to the retrospective registry nature of the study.",

Although comparisons of sibling and unrelated donor transplants in MDS are readily available, the literature investigating UCB is less developed. Our institutional alternative donor HCT research interest has pioneered the field of UCB transplantation. When an urgent HCT is needed and few unrelated donor options are available, our institutional alternative donor choice is an UCB source. Our current data highlight similar outcomes regardless of donor source and are consistent with previous publications from our institution with respect the MDS and AML outcomes.19, 26 To date, the largest MDS UCB outcomes analysis was a recent 2015 Eurocord-EBMT analysis highlighting the outcomes of MDS adults undergoing either UCB (n=129) or peripheral blood MUD (n=502) RIC HCT. In this analysis, 2-year survival ranged from 30% for UCB to 50% for MUD (P<0.0001) with similar relapse incidence across donors (23% MUD to 30% UCB) but increased NRM at 42% for UCB compared with 31% for PB MUD (P=0.03). Based on these data, the authors concluded that PB MUD donors were the preferred stem cell source compared with UCB in the absence of a sibling donor.27 Although the outcomes of this study highlight a much larger \u2018MDS\u2019 patient cohort, it is important to note that 65% of the MDS patients within the entire cohort had progressed to AML prior to transplantation, and of those patients, only 52% had achieved remission prior to transplant. Specifically, within the UCB group 71% had progressed to AML and only 48% had achieved CR prior to transplant. This study is thus limited by the heterogeneity of patients/conditioning regimens/supportive care inherent in a registry study and the small number of true MDS patients not progressing to AML receiving an UCB HCT (n=37).27 Despite these limitations, the analysis importantly highlights surprisingly good outcomes of survival and relapse for such a high-risk group of patients with the majority of the MDS patients progressing to AML, only half in remission, and receiving only RIC. Thus these data suggest that both MUD/UCB RIC transplants can be effective in curing even high-risk MDS/AML patients. Although our study is limited by a relatively small total sample size with shorter follow-up in the UCB cohort, the 44 patients with true MDS undergoing HCT with an UCB donor source represents the largest published population of such patients to date. The experience at the University of Minnesota developing and fine tuning the approach to UCB transplantation (utilizing UCB in the setting of an urgent transplant need with few unrelated donor options and avoiding use in the setting of extensive marrow fibrosis) along with the consistent conditioning platform and supportive care across all patients likely partially explains these differential outcomes between our study and the EBMT-Eurocord analysis.",

Interestingly, within the RIC cohort, those not receiving ATG had the highest incidence of relapse. By protocol definition, those who received pre-HCT multi-agent chemotherapy did not require ATG inclusion in the RIC preparative regimen, and thus likely highlights a more advanced MDS patient population. This difference in relapse did not translate into a survival difference between the conditioning intensity cohorts, suggesting that the pace of relapse in MDS disease biology allowed time for additional interventions that prevented death following relapse. Although the recent prospective randomized BMT CTN 0901 trial comparing conditioning intensity in AML and MDS did show increased relapse and a trend toward improved OS in the MA cohort, the study included only a small percentage of MDS patients and thus does not definitively answer the conditioning intensity debate in MDS.29",
