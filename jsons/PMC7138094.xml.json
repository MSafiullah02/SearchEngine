PEC includes several intestinal disorders that occur in turkeys mostly within the first three weeks of life (Guy, 2013) and its clinical signs often include diarrhea, stunting, anorexia, dehydration, weight loss, and immune dysfunction (atrophy of the thymus and the bursa of Fabricius) that promotes secondary infections.

The parameters necessary to calculate R0 are (a) the speed of transmission and (b) the shedding duration of the infectious viruses. Generally, a virus with an R0 less than 1 will disappear quickly because an infected individual will have a low ability to infect another. A virus with an R0 greater than one will spread in the susceptible population. For IBV, an R0 of 19.95 has been estimated (de Wit, de Jong, Pijpers, & Verheijden, 1998), which is a figure comparable to the R0 of highly contagious human viruses such as measles virus (R0 12\u201018) (Masters & Perlman, 2013). For TCoV, R0 has not yet been fully calculated; however, a study with an American TCoV isolate demonstrated that infectious virus particles can be shed up to six weeks post\u2010infection in experimentally infected turkeys (Breslin et al., 2000).",

Susceptible (S) animals correspond to na\u00efve individuals who are exposed to the virus shed by infectious (I) animals. The individuals then turn to the recovered (R) stage at the end of the shedding period. The transmission rate, denoted as \u03b2, reflects the number of new infections generated by one typical infectious individual per time unit. In this study, owing to the high transmissibility of the virus, a two\u2010hourly time scale was selected. With these notations, the probability for a susceptible individual to become infected on a time interval [t, t + \u0394t] is given by p\nt = 1 \u2212 exp (\u2212\u03b2I\nt \u0394t/N), where N is the total number of individuals involved in the experiment (here, N = 30). Therefore, the number of new cases on each time interval [t\ni, t\ni+1] follows a binomial distribution with parameters Sti, the number of susceptible individuals at time t\ni, and pti, the probability of infection. The number of susceptible and infectious animals was updated for each sampling interval, as well as the number of new cases, allowing the estimation of the transmission rate parameter \u03b2. The generalized linear model approach was used for the estimation, using the complementary log\u2010log link function and taking logIN\u0394t as offset variable (Becker, 1989; Ebl\u00e9, De Koeijer, Bouma, Stegeman, & Dekker, 2006; Velthuis, De Jong, Kamp, Stockhofe, & Verheijden, 2003).",

However, between 10 and 12 hpc the level of viral RNA detected in the same bird increased to 3.39 log10 cp/\u03bcl and a second contact was positive at 2.19 log10 cp/\u03bcl. Between 12 and 14 hpc, seven contacts were positive with values ranging from 2.24 to 4.77 log10 cp/\u03bcl. Between 14 and 26 hpc, 23 contacts were positive with a mean \u00b1 SD of 4.86 \u00b1 0.99 log10 cp/\u03bcl.

This result would suggest the shedding period to be longer than 41 dpc.

Considering the same virus stock had been titrated previously in embryonated turkey eggs and found to have a virus titre of 104,01 EID50/ml, this would suggest that 10\u2010day\u2010old SPF turkeys are more sensitive than embryonated eggs (1 EID50 = 7 ID50) in recovering infectious TCoV, although the repeatability of Reed & Muench titration needs to be taken into consideration. Similarly, at one ID50/ml, viral RNA levels were also beyond the limit of detection of a well characterized qRT\u2010PCR (Maurel et al., 2011), so that 10\u2010day\u2010old turkeys might be also more sensitive than qRT\u2010PCR to detect infectious TCoV. Such a high susceptibility of young hosts was also reported in a recent paper where an enteric coronavirus of pigs (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, PEDV) was shown to infect more efficiently 5\u2010day\u2010old piglets than tissue culture (minimal infectious dose = 0.056 TCID50) (Thomas et al., 2015). RNA levels at the PEDV MID have also been reported to be beyond the limit of detection by qRT\u2010PCR (Goyal, 2014). The effects of turkey age on the ID50 of Fr\u2010TCoVwere not investigated in the current study however, the fact that TCoV associated enteric disorders such as PEC or poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) are predominantly diseases of younger subjects (Barnes et al., 2000) lends support to more resistance in older birds.",

No airborne transmission over a distance of 2\u20133 m was observed. Mathematically the results of the oro\u2010faecal transmission gave a calculated rate of one newly infected individual every 2.5 hr and provided a figure for the first parameter in estimating an Fr\u2010TCoV R0. This transmission rate was measured in terms of detection of viral RNA and the passage of each individual from a negative to positive status above the threshold of the qRT\u2010PCR used. Considering what was discussed previously regarding the relative sensitivity of qRT\u2010PCR and 10\u2010day\u2010old turkeys to detect infectious TCoV, the actual rate of transmission could be quicker. The qRT\u2010PCR used in this study is in the authors\u2019 experience the most sensitive tool for detecting Fr\u2010TCoV and thus until a more sensitive method becomes available the calculated figure of 2.5 hr cannot be refined. Nevertheless, these results showed that Fr\u2010TCoV can be transmitted extremely rapidly and also draw attention to the fact that when calculating transmission rates, no matter the pathogen, results will relate to the sensitivity of the diagnostic tools applied. In other words, more sensitive tools for detection equals increased transmission rates.",

At this time the authors have no data on why some subjects stopped excreting infectious virus four weeks in advance of others or if, in fact, excretion detected at six weeks was representative of subjects with intermittent excretion profiles as has been observed in cats experimentally infected with FECV (Kipar, Meli, Baptiste, Bowker, & Lutz, 2010). In cats, this intermittent excretion has been suggested to be linked with persistent infection in the colon (lower intestine) from which viruses then have the potential to re\u2010infect the small intestine at any time. The presence of virus in both regions of the gut can then result in renewed excretion (Kipar et al., 2010). Concerning Fr\u2010TCoV these questions should be assigned to specifically designed trials and histopathological examination, however, the present study seems to indicate a clear tropism of Fr\u2010TCoV for lower intestine, as described for FECV (Kipar et al., 2010). Indeed, in the current study, Fr\u2010TCoV's ability to infect the turkey intestinal tract was successfully demonstrated with immunohistochemical staining. The virus showed preferred tropism for the lower intestines similar to what has been also observed for US lineage TCoV (NC95) (Guy, Smith, Breslin, Vaillancourt, & Barnes, 2000), which likely reflects distribution of the TCoV receptor (Ambepitiya Wickramasinghe et al., 2015). This distribution pattern could be time\u2010dependent though and since all tissue samples were collected at a single time point (3 dpi in Exp 3), evaluation of intestinal segments taken at different time points after infection would be needed to fully confirm these observations.",

Although viral protein expression was most distinctively seen in epithelial cells (enterocytes) overlying these subepithelially\u2010located lymphoid tissues, in several birds a delicate, finely dispersed and dotted immunohistochemical staining signal was present subepithelially within these lymphoid tissues. Taking into account both the signal's fragmented subtle aspect compared to the signal at the epithelial level and otherwise the biological function of these lymphoid aggregates, the authors speculate that this might be the result of immunohistochemical demonstration of degraded viral protein within phagocytozing antigen\u2010presenting cells. Occasionally, as shown in the inset picture in Figure 3c, individual cells in the subepithelial lymphoid tissues displayed a \u2018full\u2010cytoplasmic\u2019 immunohistochemical staining signal comparable to the signal seen in the majority of infected enterocytes. Since, upon viral inoculation of an animal, such abundant intracellular signal is usually seen in cells known to be within the virus\u2019 tropism (in other words \u2018presumably correlated with true viral replication\u2019), it is therefore possible that Fr\u2010TCoV can incidentally replicate in antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs), represented by dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages. APC tropism was recently demonstrated for subtypes of TCoVs relative IBV, with this ability to infect APCs being a determinant for cell\u2010mediated viremic systemic spread and subsequent infection of the chicken's urinary tract (Reddy et al., 2016). However, although the stellate morphology and the localization of the depicted cell (see inset Figure 3c) suggest that it likely belongs to one of the mentioned APC families, additional assays characterizing these cell types (for example double immunohistochemical staining for both viral protein expression and cell\u2010characterizing protein epitopes) are needed to confirm a APC tropism for TCoV.",

This discrepancy could be explained by the difference in age of the birds inoculated as in the US TCoV study, birds had been inoculated at 6 days of age; alternatively, like the distribution pattern discussed above, this discrepancy might be a time\u2010dependent feature, with 3 dpi in our study being too early for morphologic changes \u2013 resulting from epithelial damage, local tissue reactions and influx of immune cells to manifest. Furthermore the specific date post\u2010 inoculation when microscopic lesions were observed in the US TCoV study was not given (Guy et al., 2000). It is equally possible that under experimental conditions the European lineage of TCoV simply has a different pathogenic profile to those of the US lineage.
