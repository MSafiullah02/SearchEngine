            "text": "Viruses are intracellular obligatory parasites that repurpose the host cell machinery to replicate. Viruses can create modified intracellular compartments referred to as viral factories where they concentrate resources required for replication and are shielded from host antiviral mechanisms.1, 2 However, because viruses do not encode their own ribosomes, viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) require access to cellular ribosomes to be translated. When viral mRNAs traffic to cellular ribosomes, they are exposed to host defense mechanisms more than other products generated during virus replication. Viral genomic RNAs are also excellent targets of host surveillance mechanism as they can be significantly different from cellular molecules. Thus, viral nucleic acids are a common target of several host antiviral mechanisms.3, 4, 5, 6 Targeting of viral RNAs often results in the generation of virus\u2010derived small RNAs (vsRNAs) that can be detected during infection in fungi, plants, arthropods, and mammals.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Although vsRNAs are commonly observed in different organisms, their relative abundance can vary substantially.8 In insects, for example, viral sequences are 10\u2010fold enriched in the small RNA fraction compared to what was observed in the long RNA pool from infected cells.10 In contrast, viral sequences in lungs of infected mice were underrepresented by a factor of 100 in the pool of small compared with long RNAs.10 This relative enrichment or depletion is likely caused by differential targeting of viruses by RNA surveillance mechanisms. Nevertheless, targeting of viral transcripts and genomes is a common feature of different antiviral mechanisms and the production of vsRNAs can be highly informative. An analogy can be made about the indirect information about viruses obtained from vsRNAs and the mammalian antibody response. As initially proposed by Rivers and coworkers, virus\u2010specific antibody responses can be indicative of an infection without requiring direct detection of the virus.14 Similarly, vsRNAs generated by host pathways can also provide information about the infection without the requirement for direct detection of the virus.",

In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, we observed that the identification of viruses by small RNA sequencing performed significantly better than long RNAs. Small RNAs provided more sequence coverage of the viral genome in less processing time. Efficient generation of small RNAs by RNAi pathways has been proposed as the main reason for the optimized detection of viruses by small RNA sequencing.50, 62 Indeed, we observed that small RNA products from siRNA and piRNA pathways tended to optimize the assembly of longer viral contigs likely due to extensive overlap between sequences. Viral sequences also showed a 10\u2010fold natural enrichment in the small RNA fraction compared to long RNAs in the same mosquito sample.10 Interestingly, small RNAs from lungs of coronavirus\u2010infected mice, where no activation of RNAi pathways was observed, showed a 100\u2010fold depletion of viral sequences relative to long RNAs.10 Nevertheless, even in this situation, viral contigs represented 30% of contigs assembled from small RNAs compared to 5% of long RNAs. Thus, small RNAs seem to favor assembly of viral contigs even when they represent a small fraction of the total.10 This can help to save computational time used for the analysis of large\u2010scale sequencing data that can be the bottleneck for many metagenomic studies. Thus, some advantages of virus detection using small RNAs compared to long RNAs are not restricted to situations where the RNAi pathway is activated.10\n",

The siRNA pathway is likely the best example on how molecular patterns of small RNAs can be explored.

In most eukaryotes, the siRNA pathway is activated when Dicer directly recognizes and processes viral dsRNA into 20\u201323 nt long duplex small RNAs.4 These siRNAs usually do not have strong nucleotide preferences and cover symmetrically both strands of the dsRNA trigger. Canonical siRNAs also have 3\u2032 2\u2010nt overhangs and ~19\u201321 nt overlap between the two strands. Thus, these molecular characteristics are a signature of activation of the siRNA pathway that has been consistently detected for a variety of viruses in fungi, animals, and plants9, 12, 73, 74, 75, 76 (Figure 3(a)). As the activation of the siRNA pathway is so strongly associated with viral infection, the detection of small RNAs containing molecular patterns consistent with siRNAs could indicate a viral origin (Figure 2(b)).

Indeed, viruses that generate virus\u2010derived piRNAs have RNA genomes and replicate in the cytoplasm while the endogenous piRNA pathway is initiated from DNA\u2010dependent transcripts in the nucleus, at least in Drosophila.15 Our own data suggest that a strong activation of the piRNA pathway requires that the virus infects reproductive tissues where components of this pathway are commonly enriched in insects.10, 41, 87 We observed that the same A. aegypti mosquitoes infected by two different viruses, Phasi Charoen like\u2010virus (PCLV) and Humaita\u2010Tubiacanga virus (HTV), only the former showed abundant production of piRNAs which correlated with ovary infection (Figure 3(a)).10 In contrast, A. albopictus mosquitoes infected with Chikungunya virus showed production of virus\u2010derived piRNAs in the head and thorax of infected insects.13 However, in this case, the production of piRNAs was very inefficient as virus\u2010derived siRNAs were 120\u2010fold more abundant than piRNAs. Although more studies are required, a strong production of virus\u2010derived piRNAs may suggest that the virus has tropism for reproductive tissues in the insect (Figure 4(b)). Thus, the activation of the piRNA pathway could be very informative about tissue tropism but cannot be used as a viral signature as it is not a broad response to viral infection. Indeed, we still lack good evidence that the piRNA pathway has an antiviral role because it has little impact on virus replication in mosquito cell lines.48\n",

However, these exonucleases can be impaired by highly structured regions or internal modifications within the target.89, 90 As a result, RNA decay nucleases often produce vsRNAs of different sizes that tend to accumulate near the end of the substrate or close to regions with secondary structure.29, 91 In the case of RNase L, small RNA products also have a very broad distribution as this endonuclease targets U\u2010rich sequences whose abundance may vary within target RNAs. In addition, RNA decay and RNase L pathways may act together to generate complex patterns of vsRNAs in infected cells. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells and green monkey vero cells, the size profile of small RNAs derived from Sindbis virus was remarkably consistent even in the absence of detectable activation of RNAi pathways.61 RNase L was required for the generation of some vsRNAs although they did not seem to be direct products of this nuclease. Indeed, the generation of Sindbis vsRNAs required the joint action of RNase L and other nucleases such as XRN1. In this case, vsRNAs seemed to accumulate in regions of the Sindbis genome containing posttranscriptional modifications that inhibited further degradation.61 Similarly, in human HeLa cells, the degradation of the poliovirus RNA is further targeted by RNase L together with other nucleases, which resulted in a complex pattern of vsRNAs generated across the virus genome.92 Thus, small RNAs generated by RNA decay and RNase L seem to reflect structured or modified regions within viral RNAs (Figure 4(d)).

These pathways contribute to the antiviral response by degrading viral RNAs, which results in the generation of vsRNAs. This common targeting of viral RNAs helps to explain why viral sequences are often abundant within the pool of small RNAs in infected cells. In addition, these tiny molecules are imprinted with molecular characteristics that reflect the host pathway and viral RNA from which they originate. Indeed, information can be extracted from these molecular footprints to trace back their viral origin. Directly, small RNA from infected hosts can be assembled into longer contiguous sequences and used to detect viruses by homology searches against known viral references. Indirectly, molecular patterns of small RNAs that are consistent with the activation of the siRNA pathway can be used as a signature to suggest a viral origin to novel assembled sequences. This latter strategy can help overcome a great limitation of virus discovery by metagenomic strategies, because it does not require sequence similarity searches against know references. Pattern analysis of vsRNAs allows the discovery of more divergent viral sequences with no similarities to known viruses present in reference databases.10, 11 We also showed here that the pattern of small RNAs is able to differentiate between sequences derived from viruses and integrated EVEs, which can be a powerful tool to indicate whether viral sequences originate from an active infection. Furthermore, the pattern of vsRNAs generated by host mechanisms other than the siRNA pathway can also provide information about viruses such as their tissue tropism, coding of inhibitors to the siRNA pathway, and structured regions of the viral genome. Although it might not be universally applicable, these advantages make small RNA sequencing a great strategy to identify and characterize viruses.",

During infection, virus genomes and transcripts are sometimes exposed and can be recognized by different host RNA surveillance mechanisms. RNA decay, RNA interference (RNAi), and RNase L pathways are good examples of such mechanisms. Mammalian RNA decay involves different mechanisms such as deadenylation\u2010dependent and nonsense\u2010mediated decay (NMD). The former involves shortening of the poly(A) tail by deadenylases followed by removal of the 5\u2032 cap by mRNA\u2010decapping enzymes (DCPs). NMD is initiated by recognition of aberrant mRNAs that are cleaved by endonucleases. In both cases, the initial cleavage allows the mRNA to be targeted 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 by XRN1 and 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 by the exosome complex. The mammalian RNase L pathway is triggered when viral dsRNA is recognized by OAS enzymes that catalyze the production of 2\u2032\u20105\u2032 oligoadenylates (2\u20105A). These molecules induce dimerization and activation of RNase L that cleaves single\u2010stranded RNAs mostly at U\u2010rich regions. Different RNAi mechanisms can generate vsRNAs during viral infection including the mammalian miRNA pathway, Drosophila small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway, and mosquito piRNA pathway. The Drosophila siRNA pathway is activated by Dcr\u20102\u2010mediated recognition of viral dsRNA that is processes progressively to generate phased duplex siRNAs. siRNA duplexes are loaded onto AGO2 to generate siRISC that will find and cleave complementary RNAs. The mammalian miRNA pathway is initiated by the recognition of structure regions within long transcripts in the nucleus by the RNase III Drosha. This enzyme, in association with a partner protein known as DGCR8, cleaves the primary transcript to excise a short hairpin (~65 nt) that is then exported to the cytoplasm. There, the hairpin is further processed by Dicer to generate miRNA duplexes of ~22 nt that will be loaded onto different mammalian Argonaute proteins (Ago1\u20134) to form miRISC. This complex targets complementary regions within the 3\u2032 UTR of mRNAs leading to translation inhibition. The mosquito piRNA pathway is triggered by the recognition of single\u2010stranded RNA precursors in a manner dependent on a specialized group of Argonautes known as PIWI proteins usually associated with an endonuclease known as Zucchini (Zuc). This initial recognition triggers processing of the precursor into primary piRNAs that remain associated with PIWI proteins to form the piRISC. This complex carries out cleavage of complementary RNA and can also initiate the production of more piRNAs. These secondary piRNAs require an amplification loop, referred to as the ping\u2010pong mechanism, that involves another Argonaute protein known as AGO3. Different RNA surveillance mechanisms may work together to generate vsRNAs. For example, RNA fragments generated by RNAi and RNase L pathways can be further targeted by RNA decay mechanisms. RNA surveillance mechanisms generate vsRNAs that have unique molecular characteristics such as terminal modifications, size, strand bias, and nucleotide preferences shown in the figure.",

(b) Classically, the origin of contigs from large\u2010scale sequencing studies is inferred by sequence similarities by comparisons to known references in databases. Thus, contigs are identified when they show similarity to sequences from known viruses or other organisms. However, a large number of contigs in large\u2010scale sequencing studies do not show similarity to any known reference sequence. In these cases, the molecular pattern of small RNAs derived from any contig sequence can be used. The presence of a clear small RNA symmetrical size preference between 20 and 23 nt at similar abundance on both strands of the contig suggests they originated from a double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursor that was processed by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway.

(a) The partial or complete absence of an expected siRNA signature often indicates that the virus escapes the siRNA pathway. This is the case of FHV in Drosophila, whose profile is fairly divergent from the canonical siRNA profiles unless a mutant virus incapable of producing the B2 VSR is analyzed. (b) The presence of longer virus\u2010derived small RNAs of ~24\u201330 nt that show a 10\u2010nt overlap between opposite strands is a signature of piRNAs. As these are often enriched in reproductive organs, this signature may be used to infer virus infection of ovaries as observed for PCLV in Aedes mosquitoes. (c) Animal viruses can sometimes show hotspots of small RNA coverage originating exclusively from one strand. These tend to come from genomic regions that are predicted to fold onto hairpins where the 20\u201324 nt long small RNAs arise from the stems.
