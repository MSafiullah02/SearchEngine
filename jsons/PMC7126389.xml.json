The elderly is more vulnerable to the disease among them, which sometimes results in hospitalisation or death [1]. One way of countering this public health issue is to implement vaccination programme targeting the elderly [2], since influenza vaccine is considered as effective not only in preventing contraction of the disease [3], but also reducing risk of death after contraction [4]. Although some recent studies cast doubts as to the latter effectiveness, i.e., reducing mortality [5], [6], [7], a number of countries or regions organise such vaccination programmes [8]. In Japan, national government has set up a nationwide influenza vaccination programme for people aged 65 and over since 2001/2002 season.",

Subsidy is also provided [8], since reducing the price of a shot is believed to increase the uptake of vaccination. However, the response of the elderly as a consumer in regard to price changes, i.e., price elasticity of demand, has not been well studied. Theoretically, knowledge of price elasticity is of great help to design an efficient subsidy programme including vaccination programmes [9], but a few are reported in the literature. A correlation between subsidy levels and uptake rates is found in multinational comparison incorporating 18 developed countries [10]; a rise in uptake rate that is resulted from Medicare coverage in the U.S. [11]; the removal of fee increases uptake rate in an intervention study in Denmark [12]; price elasticity of demand, \u22120.022, is estimated by conjoint analysis before the launch of the national programme in Japan [13].",

The current Japanese programme, however, obligates municipal authorities to manage vaccination for their aged inhabitants, and the decision of co-payment and subsidy level, that is, the price of a shot to a consumer, is devolved to municipal authorities. This arrangement makes the area of each municipality a market for flu shots, and it is possible to observe pairs of various prices and uptake rates. There is a study which reports price elasticity of \u22120.26 during 2001/2002 and 2002/2003 season by a survey covering 13 big cities [14]. We also take advantage of this \u201cnatural experiment\u201d, and aim to estimate price elasticity of demand for influenza vaccination among the elderly with national representative samples. The results of this study should be useful in managing vaccination programmes through price setting, and deepen the understanding of consumer behaviour toward preventive services.",

In this survey, operational 300 samples were randomly selected using a list of 22,671,944 people aged 65 and over inhabiting all 3252 municipalities during 2002/2003 season as a sampling frame. A questionnaire inquiring price charged to a recipient, subsidy provided by the municipality, the number of target population, and the number of vaccinated from 2001/2002 to 2004/2005 season was sent to each municipal authorities where operational samples inhabited. The use of the combination of individual level sampling frame and municipality level survey is chosen, since large-scale mergers of municipalities underwent in these years as a local government reform. 196 authorities out of 210 replied, which gave response rate of 94.0% at sample level.",

Similar increases are also observed in urban area and rural area, while higher rates are observed in rural area than in urban area. It should be noted that the observed period is the beginning of the programme, during which there is supposed to bring about the broad diffusion of vaccination [28]. Additionally, outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 season and avian flu in 2002/2003 season occurred, and a word, \u201cinfluenza\u201d, was heavily publicised during these seasons. The need of preparation for the emergence of pandemic influenza virus was also emphasised by the government in the following years. Such information may have affect on consumers\u2019 behaviour. National average of price in all seasons is \u00a51134 (US$9.86: US$1 = \u00a5115). The lowest price is \u00a50 (US$0), and the highest \u00a52500 (US$21.74). A shot is slightly more expensive in rural area than in urban area. National average of density of shot location, the non-cash price, is 2.0 per km2, and it ranges from 0.0023 per km2 to 20 per km2. Urban average is smaller than rural as anticipated. National average of income, the activity level of local economy, is \u00a53,439,000 (US$29,900), and it ranges from \u00a52,407,000 (US$20,900) to \u00a54,970,000 (US$43,200). Urban average is larger than rural as anticipated. National average of subsidy is \u00a52962 (US$25.76), and it ranges from \u00a50 (US$0) to \u00a54599 (US$39.99), while national average of subsidy level 72.1%, from 0% to 100%.

A benefit-cost analysis of current Japanese programme speculates potential benefit gain obtainable from increasing subsidy based on the estimation of price elastic demand in big cities [14]. But given the price inelastic results of this study, it is not recommendable to hastily raise the subsidy level at least in urban area. Since we demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of current programme with average subsidy level of 71%, of which results unchanged even when the effectiveness of reducing mortality is assumed negligible, elsewhere [31], more effort on public relations or health education without the increase of subsidy level may be a preferred policy in urban area. There may be some potential benefit gain by increasing subsidy in rural area.",

When organising a vaccination programme, managers should be careful about the balance between subsidy and other efforts, by taking the characteristics of the locality into account and with price elasticity of demand in mind.
