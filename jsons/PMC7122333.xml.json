            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is known to be the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children (1, 2). Illness begins most frequently with rhinorrhea, sneezing, and cough. Most children experience recovery from illness after 8\u201315 days. During their first RSV infection, 25\u201340% of infected infants and young children have signs or symptoms of bronchio\u00adlitis or pneumonia, and 0.5\u20132% require hospitalization. There are high-risk groups prone to severe RSV disease that include premature infants, children with congenital heart and chronic lung diseases, and immunosuppressed patients or those with a congenital immunodeficiency, in which 25% require hospitalization (3\u20135). Infections with RSV of genotype A or B may result in differing clinical manifestations and outcomes (6, 7). RSV causes hazardous nosocomial infection and produces outbreaks each year with widespread infections in both children and adults, including medical personnel, who may have a mild enough illness that does not cause absences from work. Furthermore, the spread of the virus is facilitated by the number of young infants admitted during an outbreak who tend to shed high titers of virus for prolonged periods (8). Other viruses that can mimic RSV infection include adenoviruses, influenza virus (INF) A and B, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and rhinoviruses. Patients with acute respiratory infections can present with similar signs and symptoms regardless of the viral pathogen, and clinical differential diagnosis of infections caused by these viruses can be difficult.",

            "text": "Early and accurate virus-specific laboratory diagnosis significantly enhances patient management. There are currently a variety of laboratory tests available to detect and differentiate respiratory viruses, which have been developed over the last two decades. The use of rapid tests in the diagnosis of RSV infection allows implementation of appropriate infection control measures, thus reducing nosocomial spread (9) and may be useful for consideration of timely treatment with aerosolized ribavirin in severe cases. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests have good sensitivity for RSV, but are not as good for other respiratory viruses (10, 11). Rapid EIA antigen tests are available for RSV and Influenza A and B; they are easy to perform, and more rapid than DFA, but have slightly lower sensitivity and specificity (12, 13). Among the respiratory viruses mentioned previously, the vast majority will be grown in traditional viral culture cell lines used in clinical virology laboratories with the exception of hMPV, which is not yet widely used in routine diagnostic laboratories (14). Furthermore, cell culture has a slow turnaround time with most viruses showing no detectable cytopathic effects until 3 to 14 days later. However, a shell vial technique incorporated with mixed fresh cells (R-Mix, Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc., Athens, OH) can be performed which speeds up the turnaround time to 2 days and has a sensitivity similar to conventional cell culture (15). The diagnosis of RSV infections using serology has no practical applications in clinical use.",

            "text": "As is the case with other respiratory viral pathogens, molecular assays based on in vitro nucleic acid amplification have been implemented gradually in clinical laboratories for RSV detection. These molecular assays, led by PCR, in general, have demonstrated to be superior to routine diagnostic methods in terms of their high sensitivity and specificity (16\u201318), which are especially useful in adult patients when viral shedding is short and low (19, 20). While cell culture remains the gold standard for RSV diagnosis, the molecular assays have been considered the \u201cplatinum\u201d standard to be used as the reference to validate new diagnostic kits for RSV detection (2, 12). However, these organism-specific monoplex assays are resource-intensive; when a respiratory viral infection is considered, the list of possible etiologies is necessarily long. Multiplex RT-PCR-based techniques have widely been reported for simultaneous detection of a panel of respiratory viral pathogens in a single reaction (21\u201325). Several products, including the Hexaplex assay (Prodesse, Waukesha, WI), the PLx-RVP assay (EraGen Biosciences, Madison, WI), the ID-Tag RVP (TM Biosciences, Toronto, Canada), and the ResPlex II (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), are commercially available (22, 26\u201330).

The first, specimen processing and nucleic acid extraction, is done by using an easyMAG automated total nucleic acid extraction instrument (bioMerieux, Durham, NC), based on a magnetic silica particle-based technique (31). The kits are available from bioMerieux and work on a variety of clinical specimens, including nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates and yields high quantity and quality total nucleic acids (32). The second, nucleic acid amplification, uses a target-enriched multiplexing (TEM)-PCR (33), which contains two nested primer sets for each organism and a set of Super Primers, to simultaneously amplify INF-A, INF-B, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4, RSV-A, RSV-B, hMPV, rhinoviruses (RhV), enteroviruses (EnV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) gene in a single reaction tube (27, 29). The target gene from each of the viruses is listed in Table 1. The third, amplicon detection and identification, is reached by using a microsphere-based liquid array (Luminex, Austin, TX). A median fluorescence intensity (MFI) is reported for each target. A positivity cut-off is used to determine if the sample is positive for a particular target (34, 35). The last amplification and detection components are included in the ResPlex II kit, which is available from Qiagen.\n\n",

This incubation also partially inactivates the reverse transcriptase. The thermal cycling program includes steps for both reverse transcription and PCR. Do not activate HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase until the reverse-transcription reaction is finished.It is important to maintain an RNase-free environment during extraction and RT-PCR setup steps. Set up all reaction steps in an area separate from the other areas (extraction, amplification, and detection). Dead air boxes can be used for each step/area to avoid contamination between areas.Set up all RT-PCR reactions on ice. RNA is the target, which is fragile. Keeping the reaction mixes cold will reduce RNA degradation.Use disposable, RNase-free tips containing hydrophobic filters to minimize cross-contamination.Use of the GeneAmp 9700 PCR System (Applied Biosystems) running in the 9600 emulation mode for the amplification step is recommended. Performance of this protocol using other equipment has not been verified yet.From the beginning of the hybridization procedure in the detection step, the detection reaction must be kept at 52\u00b0C until analysis on the LiquiChip 200 Workstation.Protect the ResPlex II Bead Mix and reaction mix from light. Foil should be used to cover the tubes and 96-well plate.In a clinical validation study on 360 archived frozen nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates, the sensitivity and specificity for RSV detection were 73.3 and 100%, when compared to a standard combined from cell culture and monoplex real-time TaqMan PCR. Sensitivities and specificities were 72.2\u201390% and 99.7\u2013100%, respectively, for other respiratory viruses. When a full panel (96 tests) was run, the hands-on time and the test turnaround time were estimated as 55 min and 6 h, respectively (27).There is no validation data on PIV-2, PIV-4, enterovirus, and rhinovirus. There is some cross-reactivity between PIV-1 and PIV-3 in the ResPlex assay; of 27 samples testing positive for parainfluenza, eight samples (29.6%) had IMF values higher than the cutoff values for PIV-1 and PIV-3 (27).The assay was useful to detect and recognize viral coinfections, which are usually related to more severe clinical manifestations (30).Respiratory DNA viruses, such as bocavirus (36), adenovirus, and a recently reported respiratory polyomavirus (37), were not covered in the ResPlex II kits evaluated in the study. A new version of the ResPlex II kit, which covers bocavirus and adenovirus in addition to those described in the chapter, has been available from Qiagen since July 2008.We thank Melinda McCormac, Shufang Meng, and Wray Estes for their excellent technical support. This project was partially supported by a research and development grant from Qiagen. The protocol contains partial information in product inserts of the easyMAG and the ResPlex II kits and the Standard Operating Manual of the Molecular Infectious Disease Laboratory, Vanderbilt University Hospital.\n",
