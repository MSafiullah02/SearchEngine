Still, we did not detect association between neonatal bronchial hyperresponsiveness and low-grade inflammation, which we would have expected given our previous finding of association between methacholine challenge results and subsequent asthma development. 26 It is a limitation of the study that we were unable to detect a biologically meaningful signal from IL-1b, which is presumably caused in part by the plasma storage time of up to 13 years before analysis, during which samples had been thawed and frozen on several occasions. IL-1b is particularly sensitive to freeze-thaw cycles and degrades by greater than 50% over time, even when samples are stored at 2808C. 24 It is well known that circulating IL-1b levels are approximately 5 times less than TNF-a levels in healthy adults, 23 but in our case the median IL-1b level was 200 times less than the median TNF-a level (0.01 vs 2.34 ng/L), and we were unable to detect an association between IL-1b and hs-CRP levels. Another limitation of the study is the at-risk nature of the cohort because all children were born to mothers with a history of asthma. We demonstrated recently that the offspring of mothers with a history of asthma, allergy, or eczema in an unselected mother-child cohort have a topical downregulated immune signature in the airway mucosa compared with children of mothers without such disorders. 27 Yet even though the at-risk nature of the cohort might have affected the absolute biomarker levels, this should not influence our ability to explore the association between neonatal spirometry and markers of systemic low-grade inflammation within the cohort.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 418, "end": 420, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 832, "end": 834, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 950, "end": 952, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1537, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strengths and limitations of the study"}, {"text": "It is another limitation of our study that biomarkers were assessed at 6 months while neonatal lung function was tested at 4 weeks.

In contrast, another study of 62 school-aged children with controlled and uncontrolled asthma 30 did not detect an association between hs-CRP levels and FEV 1 values but found that hs-CRP levels were greater in patients with uncontrolled versus those with controlled asthma, which might reflect the degree of airway inflammation. These studies might be underpowered and are hampered by the wide age ranges and lack of control groups. Importantly, it is a different research question whether established asthma is associated with detectable systemic inflammation, unlike our aim to study whether systemic inflammation in very early life is associated with neonatal lung function before symptom debut. A possible explanation of the identified association between reduced neonatal lung function and increased hs-CRP levels is that diminished forced volume is caused by airway inflammation. In vitro murine and human lung cell studies have established a possible role of the proinflammatory cytokines stimulating CRP release, such as IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b, in the pathophysiology of obstructive airway inflammation. 32, 33 Persistently increased CRP levels might induce an increased vulnerability to changes in the early-life environment through its actions as a general scavenger protein with important innate immune functions in the recognition and elimination of bacteria and damaged human cells through opsonization, phagocytosis, and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. 1 Therefore reduced neonatal lung function might reflect subclinical bacterial airway colonization and airway inflammation predating detection of clinical symptoms and systemic low-grade inflammation. Such a disease trajectory is well known in patients with cystic fibrosis, for example, in whom reduced lung function has been shown to precede clinical disease penetrance 34 and correlates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway colonization before exacerbations. 35 Alternatively, reduced neonatal lung function does not lead to systemic inflammation but is rather an independent characteristic of neonates with sustained low-grade inflammation in early life. Such inefficient immune regulation might be driven by the newborn's genotype interacting with the intrauterine and early-life environment, thereby affecting the plasticity of the developing immune system. In support of the latter theory, higher baseline CRP levels have been demonstrated in westernized populations, where obstructive airway disorders are more prevalent compared with rural societies. 36 We assessed lung function in the 4-week-old asymptomatic neonates and the inflammatory biomarkers at 6 months. We can only speculate whether this concurs with the onset of an underlying disorder or whether this possibly reflects a disorder beginning even earlier in life, perhaps during pregnancy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 239, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 240, "end": 243, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 244, "end": 246, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 376, "end": 379, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 380, "end": 383, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 384, "end": 386, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 590, "end": 592, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1782, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1783, "end": 1785, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2590, "end": 2592, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3188, "end": 3190, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Study implications"}, {"text": "Children of the Danish COPSAC 2000 at-risk cohort exhibited an association between reduced neonatal lung function and upregulated systemic inflammatory biomarkers before symptom onset, suggesting that reduced lung function reflects an ongoing inflammatory disorder with a measurable systemic component early in life.
