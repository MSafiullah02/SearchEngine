Thus the antiviral activity we have found in the range 0.2-1 .O pg/ml is indeed absolutely selective. Further testing of the compound has been carried out in transverse sections of human embryonic trachea. The cumulative virus yield over 5 days from a challenge of 100 TCD,, of rhinovirus 2 is reduced 10-fold by 3 pg/ml and nearly 100 fold by 9 pg/ml of drug in the medium. The 50% toxic concentration as judged by cessation of ciliary activity is 25-30 pg/ml so that the antiviral activity is selective by factors of 10 and 3, respectively. In this type of experiment, the drug is present continuously in the culture medium which is renewed each day of the 4-5 day experiment. Intermittent dosing of drugs is characteristic of most schedules of chemotherapy and, from the point of view of the patient, the less frequently the better. We devised an intermittent dosing schedule for tracheal sections in which they were exposed to ICI 73602 for either 5 or 60 sec per day for 4 days. The results of several tests are shown in TABLE 2. Virus yields in TCD,,/ml culture fluid were measured daily from treated sections and from control sections that were treated daily with isotonic saline in exactly the same way as the drug-treated sections. Experiments on fragments from the same trachea are grouped together each with its own control. It can be seen that the compound will produce effectively complete inhibition of viral replication when dosed once per day for one min at a concentration of 0.35 mg/ml or for 5 sec per day at concentrations between 1.0 and 1.5 mg/ml. Attempts to make rhinovirus cultures resistant to ICI 73602 by repeated passage in subinhibitory concentrations were not successful. Thus the compound differs significantly from guanidine, where resistance begins to develop after only one passage,* and from some other antiviral guanidine derivative^,^ where resistance developed more slowly but involved cross-resistance to guanidine.",

However, these studies also showed the compound to have similarities to guanidine in that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity was inhibited by the drug, although synthesis of polymerase polypeptides appeared to be unaffected. Toxicological examination of ICI 73602 has shown that it is a well-tolerated compound. No adverse effects were observed when it was administered to rats either by instillation into the nostrils six times per day for 7 days at concentrations up to 400 pg/ml, or by intraperitoneal injection at 100 mg/kg daily for 14 days. There is little or no systemic absorption of the compound from an oral or intranasal dosein rats.",
