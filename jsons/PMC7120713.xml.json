By a curious set of coincidences, I found myself almost immediately deeply involved in many of the activities flowing from the Government\u2019s acceptance of the recommendations. Having indicated my intention to take premature retirement from Coventry Health Authority in 1990 in order to develop my teaching activities at Warwick University, where I had been a visiting senior lecturer in \u00adcommunity medicine for 10 years, I found that the fact that I was immediately available for part-time work led to a number of interesting invitations from a variety of organisations all of which were focused on one or other aspect of implementing the Acheson recommendations.",

            "text": "The first two approaches came simultaneously from the Director of CDSC, Dr Chris Bartlett, and Dr Deirdre Cunningham, Head of the Public Health Division at the Department of Health, who jointly recruited me essentially to carry out a survey of the 14 Regional Health Authorities in order to ascertain who would be discharging the duties of CCDC in each district, the professional background of each post holder and what specific training needs might be identified for the \u00adcompetent discharge of the relevant duties. These regional visits also would provide the opportunity to identify those trainees (mainly in public health medicine and medical microbiology) who might be keen to become CCDCs, and which in turn might give an indication of the need for training programmes that could be provided by universities or other educational establishments (Department of Health 1990). The third approach was more local. As it was my intention to continue to reside in the West Midlands, the Regional Medical Officer, Dr Michael Harrison, suggested that I should not neglect my \u201chome\u201d Region and therefore I gladly also accepted his invitation to take on the part-time role of coordinator of training programmes in communicable \u00addisease control for the West Midlands. These three interlocking sets of duties, none of which in itself was too demanding or time-consuming, produced the amusing result that, retiring from Coventry HA on the 31st May 1990, I \u00adrecommenced work on the \u00adfollowing day, operating from three separate locations considerable distances apart. As this was at a time when mobile telephones were not very common, my wife \u00adgenerously provided the coordinating link from our Coventry home.",

There was a strongly perceived need for people to be protected against communicable diseases and, unlike some other good ideas emanating from national committees from time to time, action did in fact follow. Two fields of practice within medicine were clearly able to make the major contribution, namely public health medicine/epidemiology and medical microbiology. Although the specialty of clinical infectious diseases had \u201cequal rights\u201d in this field it was found, in practice, that very few of these physicians applied for CCDC posts although the Royal College of Physicians was strongly represented on the steering group on training referred to above. (It would be idle to try to hide the fact that there was a measure of \u201chealthy rivalry\u201d between the epidemiologists and the microbiologists at this time but all committees or groups tended to ensure that both specialties had equal representation. A major joint conference held in June 1990, with a view to giving a full airing to these issues, was so well subscribed that the main hall of the Royal Institute of British Architects had to be hired to accommodate all those attending. An epidemiologist chaired the morning session and a microbiologist the afternoon one; much of the discussion was of the kind usually referred to as \u201cfull, frank and useful.\u201d)",

As one example of this development, in June 1991 I was sent by Dr Harrison to CDC Atlanta, in order to gain a general picture of how the USA was responding to the threats and specifically to learn about the relatively new computerised surveillance system known as \u00adEpi-Info and to bring back its software so that it could be introduced locally. In this connection, I was allowed to train at CDC alongside the state epidemiologists, being given the light-hearted title of \u201chonorary state epidemiologist.\u201d The reverse of this situation also applied; other countries were interested in what we were doing, and I was fortunate enough to have the experience of being invited to take part in seminars on the events in England in places as far apart as UCLA, the Oklahoma State Health Department and the University of Helsinki.",

            "text": "Back in England, however, it was felt that the special situation of Greater London deserved particular consideration, taking into account the fact that many people might live in one part of the metropolis, work in quite a different part, and engage in social activities (including eating out) in a variety of locations relatively remote from both home and work. Given also that many thousands arrive in the capital each day by air, rail and road, it was clear that communicable disease surveillance and control were of paramount importance. Accordingly in 1993 I was commissioned jointly by the four Thames Regional Health Authorities to examine the situation across Greater London\u2014comprising 41 separate District Health Authorities, each with its own CCDC\u2014and report accordingly. The four Regional Directors of Public Health kindly arranged a series of appointments in Central London for me to meet the CCDCs and take evidence from them. (Without such an arrangement the project would probably have proved impracticable within a reasonable time-frame.) The main outcome of the study was the acknowledgement of the need for shared surveillance data across Greater London (Pollock 1993) and accordingly a Pan-London Change Management Group was set up to take this forward. As a result, in 1994, the London Communicable Disease Surveillance Project came into being, funded jointly by the four Thames Regions and the Department of Health and based at CDSC Colindale and with its own monthly publication, the Thames Monitor. [Achieving this outcome required thoughtfulness and sensitivity. Individual District CCDCs, quite understandably, felt that their District data belonged to them\u2014they had collected it and they would be utilising it. However a compromise was readily reached by which District CCDCs would submit their data for a shared surveillance base covering Greater London on the clear understanding that all control activities within a District would remain their responsibility. ]",

I had some indication of one issue at my first meeting with Dr Harrison on taking up my part-time duties at the West Midlands RHA in June 1990, when he apologised for the tuna sandwiches instead of the usual corned beef ones offered, explaining that this was an instruction from the Authority\u2019s Chairman; in the latter\u2019s words, up to that point there had been no evidence of any condition that might be referred to as \u201cmad tuna disease!\u201d Certainly at that time there was considerable public anxiety that the cattle disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) \u2014so-called \u201cmad cow disease\u201d\u2014might have been spread to humans, and in that year a national surveillance unit had in fact been set up in Edinburgh to monitor this possibility. The justification for this concern was that the evidence suggested that BSE in cattle had been caused by their being fed meat and bone meal from carcases of sheep suffering from scrapie, and therefore that the infection might cross the species barrier once more and infect humans who had eaten beef (Kimberlin and Walker 1989). The widespread publicity which this matter had received altered the dietary habits of large numbers of people and food retailers were quick to respond by replacing beef, for example in pies, by other meats such as chicken. In Scotland, the well-known small round individual meat pies, an inexpensive local delicacy, were frequently filled with macaroni cheese instead. The situation even caused me a moment of minor personal embarrassment when my mother, at that time in her early 90s, insisted that it was my duty to instruct the staff of the residential home in which she was then living not to serve beef to any resident!",

But in 1996 the Edinburgh unit began to receive notifications of a similar clinical syndrome affecting much younger persons and running a more protracted course. Investigation led to the conclusion that in these cases consumption of infected beef had taken place before 1988, when a ban on feeding the suspected material to cattle had been introduced. This new syndrome, quickly given the name new variant CJD (vCJD), was therefore regarded as the consequence of being exposed to the infected meat. In 1997 it was concluded that the agent which causes vCJD in human beings was the same as that which causes BSE in cattle (Department of Health 1997). This represented a bitter irony as in 1990 the Department of Health, on the basis of professional advice, had issued a statement via the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Donald Acheson himself, that \u201cif there were any hazard for man from oral ingestion of beef or beef products, the risk would be very small indeed\u201d (Department of Health 1990). Surveillance by the Edinburgh unit has continued and at the time of writing (October 2011) 1,647 deaths from vCJD had been notified. Various aspects of medical, surgical and dental practice have had to be modified in the light of this risk of contamination by blood or blood products. A great step \u00adforward was taken in February 2011 when the MRC Prion Unit at University College London announced that its scientists had developed the world\u2019s first reliable blood test for vCJD. This should greatly aid diagnosis, and also allow screening and \u00adidentification of carriers with great significance for ensuring the safety of blood transfusion (Edgeworth et al. 2011).",

The virus is spread by blood-to-blood contact and in England the majority of infections are spread by sharing of needles and other \u201cequipment\u201d by injecting drug misusers. Sexual transmission is not considered common and specific screening of blood and blood products has cut across that particular path of transmission. The sinister aspect of hepatitis C infection is that the early stages are usually symptomless but, without treatment, about 85% go on to develop a chronic infection, with the risk of cirrhosis and a form of liver cancer. Routine screening of blood donations for anti-HCV (Hepatitis C virus) began on 1st September 1991 (Department of Health 1991).",

As coronaviruses are important pathogens of mammals and birds it was considered that these might have constituted the origin of the human infection (Fouchier et al. 2003). Although England did not have many suspected cases, it would be totally false to suggest that the country was not very heavily involved for a period of a few months.

Particularly tragically, the doctor there who identified the condition and alerted WHO was himself fatally affected.

Local transmission of the condition now known as \u201cSARS\u201d occurred within Canada, the United States, Ulan Bator, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam and Hong Kong, in addition to spreading within many parts of China itself.

A major change was the establishment of the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on 1 April 2003\u2014in the middle of the whole episode\u2014bringing into one central Agency a number of health protection bodies including the PHLS and incorporating local CCDCs into its local health protection teams. From that point onwards, the HPA coordinated the operational public health response. This response included an on-going process of contingency planning in the belief that SARS might not have \u201cgone away\u201d (Harper 2004). This view, i.e. the need to avoid any complacency, was also expressed by the then Director of the PHLS Communicable Disease Control Centre, Professor Angus Nicoll, who felt that one of the factors which had allowed England to get its preparations in place in good time was the experience gained in such places as Hong Kong and Canada which had been among the \u00adcountries earliest affected (Nicoll A, 2003, Personal communication.

The new Agency was therefore to absorb the existing functions of the PHLS (including its Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre), the Centre for Applied Microbiological Research, the National Focus for Chemical Incidents, and the National Radiological Protection Board.

(Originally it had been considered that Avian influenza did not normally infect species other than birds and pigs but there had been one episode in Hong Kong in 1997 in which 18 persons had been infected, with six deaths. On epidemiological grounds the virus had spread directly from birds to humans and this was confirmed by genetic studies.) One of the outbreaks in late 2003 was reported in a letter from Chinese scientists to the June 2004 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine and the Chinese Health Ministry informed WHO of the confirmation of this by laboratory tests. Although there was no convincing evidence that human to human spread was happening\u2014all the cases had had very close contact with poultry\u2014the memory of SARS was sufficiently recent to cause a certain amount of global anxiety; epidemiologists world-wide were expressing fears that the virus might mutate into a form which could allow human to human transmission. What actually transpired was that AH5N1 infections appeared to smoulder on, with poultry-associated cases and deaths mainly in the Far East. The media always seemed to be hinting that a human pandemic might be imminent and much publicity was given to the only two anti-virals which were considered to have some action against the virus, Tamiflu and Relenza. Aware of the anxieties being quietly expressed in the autumn of 2005 by some of my epidemio\u00adlogy colleagues, I gave way to family pressure and obtained a supply of Tamiflu and a box of face masks which, fortunately, never had to be used.",

The outbreak began in Veracruz, Mexico but continued to spread globally. The case-fatality rate appeared high initially but this was later put in perspective as the view generally developed that many milder cases had not come within any medical ambit and that the actual case denominator was very much larger than had originally been realised. In June 2009 both WHO and CDC Atlanta declared this outbreak a pandemic. In spite of its unofficial label, the AH1N1 infection was not spread by eating pork, but from person to person by droplet spray.",

Plus \u00e7a change\u2026.!)The rationale behind this change is that it is believed that such a service will give more power to local people over their health in tackling such problems as obesity, alcohol dependence, smoking, sexually-transmitted infections, and poor mental health. Furthermore, the expectation is that Directors of Public Health will be able to champion cooperation at local level so that health issues are considered alongside services such as housing, \u00adtransport and education, thus creating an environment conducive to healthy choices. The exercise of such choices will clearly be important as the Government has made it clear that it will \u201cstay out\u201d of people\u2019s everyday lives wherever possible, and instead will \u201cnudge\u201d people in the direction of choosing healthily. There is currently much professional and public discussion concerning the meaning of this word (new, in this context!) At a national level, a new core public health service\u2014Public Health England\u2014is to combine experts from public health bodies such as the Health Protection Agency and the National Treatment Agency as a part of the Department of Health itself. Public Health England will actually be accountable to the Head of the Civil Service\u2014and not to the Chief Medical Officer; this means that, for the first time, the CMO will not be responsible for public health in England (Field 2011), a somewhat paradoxical situation as the CMO\u2019s Annual Report was traditionally \u00adentitled On The State Of The Public Health. The Local Health Protection Units, broadly similar to those currently provided by the Health Protection Agency, are now to operate within its framework. It is presumed that CCDCs will work within these Units. Public Health England is also to be the appointing agency for Director of Public Health posts and the national source of professional support to such posts in their Local Authority setting.",
