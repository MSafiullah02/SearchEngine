Once infected, the person might remain asymptomatic or progress to C difficile disease. Infection and progression to disease are facilitated by use of antibiotics, which disrupt the normal flora and permit proliferation of the toxin-producing C difficile. A wide range of antibiotics have been implicated historically, including cephalosporins, penicillins, and clindamycin.3, 4, 5 Infection ranges in severity; in its most severe form it can cause toxic megacolon with subsequent colonic perforation, peritonitis, shock, and death. Colectomy might be needed to avert perforation but is associated with high risk given the age and medical comorbidities of typical patients infected with C difficile. Infection is associated with hospitals and long-term care facilities because of frequent antibiotic use, widespread contamination of the patient's environment with spores, and the density of people at high risk (ie, elderly people with several comorbidities).",

These outbreaks were associated with high case-fatality rates20, 21 and were estimated to have caused about 2000 deaths.22 This happened at the same time as an increase in severity of infection in the USA, characterised by increases in reported C difficile infection-related admission to hospital, colectomies, and deaths, dated retrospectively from the mid-1990s.13, 23, 24, 25, 26 Muto and colleagues8 noted a four-times increase in severe cases (resulting in colectomy or death) from 1999 to 2001 in a hospital outbreak in Pittsburgh, PA. A similar pattern of emergence has developed in Europe since 2005, with increasing incidence of infection10, 27 and some hospital outbreaks with more severe cases and higher case-fatality rates than previously experienced.28, 29 Outbreaks have been particularly severe in the UK, with a six-times increase in C difficile infection-related mortality from 1999 to 2006,30, 31 which preceded a stabilisation and substantial decline in incidence and mortality from 2007 to 2009.32, 33\n",

However, these countries must identify this strain if, where, and when it emerges to avoid the large epidemics of North America and parts of Europe.

Risk assessment (the technical component of risk analysis) is fundamentally based on the clear definition of a risk question. Using the OIE framework as an example, risk assessment comprises four consecutive analytic components: release assessment, exposure assessment, consequence assessment, and risk estimation.74 During each of the first three, all available evidence from published work and expert opinion is reviewed and organised on the basis of a diagrammatic construction of risk pathways.

The first documented case of infection due to PCR ribotype 027 in Ireland was in a patient transferred from a hospital in the UK,41 and the only reported case in Western Australia was in a patient transferred from the USA.57 Other anecdotal reports also suggest this as a possible (although unproven) means of international spread.

A tourist from the UK was reported to have had pseudomembranous colitis caused by C difficile PCR ribotype 027 while on holiday in Austria; endogenous cases were subsequently reported in that country.45 A person with community-acquired, fluoroquinolone-susceptible, C difficile PCR ribotype 027 infection in Sweden had previously travelled to Italy,56 suggesting (but not confirming) recreational travel as a potential source. However, asymptomatic carriage is less studied in the community than in hospital patients and the role of asymptomatic carriers in the movement of C difficile strains between jurisdictions is unknown. The often quoted prevalence of asymptomatic C difficile carriage in healthy adults, 2\u20133%, comes from a 1981 report;86 however, recent evidence of an increase in incidence of community-acquired cases in some countries warrants studies to update estimates of prevalence of asymptomatic carriage in the community. The role of antibiotic use in the community as a factor promoting carriage of C difficile is also poorly understood. In a French study of people prescribed antibiotics in the community,87 one of 262 had detectable pretreatment colonisation and seven had detectable post-treatment infection with toxigenic strains of C difficile.",

This can be estimated from various sources that are illustrated here by examples from Australia. All people visiting Australia, apart from citizens of Australia and New Zealand, require an entry visa from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and, for an assessment of risk focusing on international spread via tourists or business visitors, annual numbers of visitors from specific countries of origin can be estimated by the number of offshore visas granted (table 1\n). Alternatively, the frequency of movement of individuals can be estimated by the carrying capacity of international airlines on specific international routes (figure 2\n). For the assessment of risk focusing on international transfers of patients, numbers of patients entering from affected countries can be obtained from medical retrieval companies. Australia has strict regulations regarding the species of domestic animals entering and countries from which animals can be imported, and a risk assessment focusing on animal sources could make use of quarantine records to estimate the number of domestic animals entering by country of origin (table 2\n). Importation of livestock is highly regulated in Australia and this is an unlikely source of C difficile PCR ribotype 027, but for other countries livestock trade data can be used to establish the number of animals entering. Similarly, for Australia and other countries, data on trade in meat products could also be obtained (eg, from the UN Commodity Trade Statistics Database).",

Uncertainties surrounding these estimates are often captured by use of a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation approach. Only two publications,128, 129 both by the same group, present mathematical models for C difficile transmission and focus exclusively on the health-care setting, using a single ward-based model.

Many of the factors that precipitated the epidemics in North America and Europe are present in countries without known circulation of C difficile PCR ribotype 027, such as hospital overcrowding and understaffing, high levels of antibiotic (particularly fluoroquinolone) use, and an ageing population of hospital patients with increasing numbers and severity of comorbidities. Additionally, international travel is increasing and there is a high volume of international travel between affected and unaffected countries. It is highly probable that C difficile PCR ribotype 027 already has been or will be introduced undetected into countries not affected at present, via hospital transfers, asymptomatic carriers, or other vehicles, due to a lack of screening and the frequent movement of people and commodities across boundaries.",
