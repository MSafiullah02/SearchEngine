This highly infectious respiratory illness was caused by a novel coronavirus [2, 3]. Treatment was mainly empirical and, in the Prince of Wales Hospital, ribavirin and steroids were used as firstline treatment to suppress viral replication and minimise autoimmune pneumonitis. In c. 74% of the patients, the ribavirin-steroid combination was associated with recovery [4]. However, there was great debate as to whether ribavirin was effective against coronavirus, as well as concern about the side effects of high-dose steroids. Patients with persistent fever, radiographic progression and hypoxaemia, despite receiving 1.5 g of methylprednisolone, responded poorly to further courses of high-dose steroids, and an alternative therapy was needed. It was postulated that convalescent plasma from recovered SARS patients would carry antibodies against the coronavirus and might suppress viraemia.",

Inclusion criteria were as follows: SARS diagnosed according to the Centers for Disease Control guidelines [5]; and clinical and radiographic deterioration despite ribavirin and three doses (500 mg each) of pulsed methylprednisolone. Patients who had received intravenous immunoglobulin, pentaglobulin, protease inhibitors or fewer than three doses of methylprednisolone were excluded. The patients studied were given either convalescent plasma (plasma group) or further pulses of methylprednisolone (steroid group) at the discretion of the attending clinicians and according to the availability of convalescent plasma. The potential benefits and side effects of convalescent plasma were explained carefully to the patients and their families. Patients in the plasma group could receive pulsed steroids if their condition worsened after plasma therapy, and were then classed as plasma therapy failures. Similarly, if patients in the steroid arm deteriorated after further pulses of methylprednisolone, they could receive convalescent plasma, but were then classed as steroid therapy failures.",

However, when the analysis was repeated after excluding patients with co-morbid illness in each group, the difference in clinical outcome remained statistically significant (p 0.004). Second, the amount of antibodies given to each patient was not standardised, which could contribute to the variable clinical outcome in patients receiving convalescent plasma. Finally, it is arguable whether the ribavirin-steroid combination was effective at all in SARS patients, and the poorer outcome in the continuing high-dose methylprednisolone group might be caused simply by the deleterious effects of steroids.
