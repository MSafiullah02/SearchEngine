One of these measures, the Illness Attitudes Scale (Kellner, 1986), asked participants to indicate whether they had been told by their doctor that they currently have an illness. Because we were interested in examining health anxiety and HC-related behaviors independent from health problems, we excluded the 25 participants who reported having an illness (asthma = 5, diabetes = 3, other illnesses = 17). Thus, data from 442 participants were included in the present study. The mean age was 19.6 years, and most participants (61.3%) were women. The sample was 64.5% Caucasian (n = 285), 18.8% African American (n = 83), 8.1% Hispanic (n = 36), 7.5% Asian American (n = 33), and included 5 participants of other or unreported ethnicities.",

First, there currently exists only one published study of the SHAI\u2019s factor structure (Salkovskis et al., 2002). Second, Salkovskis et al. (2002) did not report eigenvalues, factor loadings, or percentage of explained variance for their factor analysis, thereby preventing quantitative comparisons with our results. Third, Salkovskis et al.\u2019s (2002) results were obtained in a primarily clinical (treatment-seeking) sample; thus the generalizabilty of these findings in non-treatment-seeking samples is unknown. These circumstances suggest that more exploratory research on the SHAI\u2019s factor structure is needed before researchers attempt to confirm the latent structure of this measure. The validity of the SHAI was examined through zero-order Pearson correlations with other measures and a series of multiple regressions investigating the prediction of medical utilization and safety-seeking health behaviors.",

The SHAI demonstrated satisfactory reliability and a clearly interpretable factor structure including lower-order factors assessing the perceived likelihood of illnesses, anticipated negative consequences of having an illness, and attentional deployment toward bodily sensations (i.e., body vigilance). The SHAI and its factors evidenced good convergent and divergent validity. Consistent with our hypothesis, facets of health anxiety uniquely predicted medical utilization and safety-seeking behaviors after controlling for anxiety symptoms, anxiety sensitivity, and intolerance of uncertainty. Taken together, these results support the psychometric properties and validity of the SHAI among healthy non-clinical individuals.

For example, the IAS contains items such as, \u201cDo you avoid foods which may not be healthy?\u201d and \u201cDo you avoid habits which may be harmful to you such as smoking?\u201d which are not unique to HC. In contrast, SHAI items provide an assessment of health anxiety-related cognitions independent of the respondent\u2019s health status, specific feared illnesses, and HC-related behaviors (e.g., doctor visits, body checking). Accordingly, Salkovskis et al. (2002) found that the SHAI differentiated individuals with HC from medically ill patients without HC and those with other anxiety problems. When the measure\u2019s brevity and specificity are considered along with its good psychometric properties, the SHAI appears well suited for measuring cognitive aspects of health anxiety in research and clinical settings and with both clinical and non-clinical samples.",

Cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations of HC highlight the anxiogenic role played by overestimations of the likelihood and severity of acquiring a serious illness (Warwick & Salkovskis, 1990). Because the SHAI Illness Likelihood and Illness Severity factors assess these respective cognitive biases, we were able to examine the links between these cognitions and HC-related variables. In the present study, the Illness Likelihood factor more strongly predicted medical utilization and safety-seeking behaviors than the Illness Severity factor. In contrast, intolerance of uncertainty was more strongly associated with illness severity (r = .45) than with illness likelihood (r = .32). These findings suggest that HC-related safety behaviors may be motivated, in part, by attempts to reduce concerns about the likelihood of having an illness. On the other hand, concerns about the negative consequences of having an illness, regardless of the probability of its acquisition, may be more strongly associated with intolerance of uncertainty. That is, intolerance of uncertainty may underlie extreme anxiety about diseases that are readily acknowledged as improbable (e.g., SARS, West Nile virus). Consistent with clinical experience, many individuals with HC require an absolute guarantee of good health in order to assuage their fears, perhaps because of their tendency to catastrophize about the severity of having an illness.",

This is consistent with the cognitive-behavioral model of HC outlined above which proposes that body vigilance plays a role in maintaining health anxiety.

In the present study, however, the SHAI Body Vigilance factor was only mildly correlated with anxiety sensitivity (r = .25). In concert, these findings highlight a possible difference in the nature of body vigilance in HC as compared to in panic disorder. In panic, body vigilance involves a focus on arousal-related body sensations that is thought to arise from catastrophic beliefs about such sensations (Schmidt et al., 1997). In contrast, body vigilance in HC may involve an increased focus on non-arousal-related signs and symptoms (e.g., lumps on the skin, joint pain) that arises from dysfunctional beliefs about illness. It is important to point out that despite the intuitive appeal of this distinction, it cannot be verified in the present study since two of the three SHAI Body Vigilance items do not explicitly refer to non-arousal-related sensations.",

For a number of reasons (e.g., regular gynecological checkups, fewer inhibitions about seeking help), it is perhaps not surprising that women reported utilizing more medical services than did men. Of the two HC-related behaviors we assessed, safety-seeking behaviors were specifically performed out of concern about one\u2019s health, whereas medical visits might have occurred for a variety of reasons.

First, while we eliminated participants who reported that they had medical illnesses, we could not determine the extent to which medical utilization and safety-seeking behaviors were related to actual health problems. Second, the fact that only self-report data were included raises the possibility that relationships between study variables may have been inflated as a result of questionnaire-specific method variance. Third, because of the cross sectional nature of the present study, conclusions regarding links between HC-related cognition and HC-related behavior are limited to those than can be drawn from correlational data. That is, our finding of unique relationships between HC-related cognitions and HC-related behaviors, although consistent with the cognitive-behavioral model, should not be mistaken for evidence that these dysfunctional cognitions cause an increase in medical utilization and safety maneuvers. Indeed prospective and longitudinal research is required to address the matter of reciprocal effect pathways, as are experimental studies to rule out the potential effects of third variables. Lastly, despite the fact that health anxiety significantly predicted HC-related behaviors, the majority of the variance in medical utilization and safety-seeking behaviors was left unexplained. Future research should examine the contributions of additional variables (e.g., physical symptoms, social support) that might improve our understanding of these phenomena.",

As a result, existing measures likely confound fears of these various phenomena (e.g., such as when an individual who fears that stomach discomfort will lead to cancer appears to have high anxiety sensitivity), obfuscating interpretations of scores and observed relationships between variables. Future research in this area would benefit from the development of more specific measures of these constructs, as well as empirical investigations of the extent to which existing measures of body vigilance and anxiety sensitivity assess attention to non-arousal-related sensations and fears of developing an illness.",

Consistent with the cognitive-behavioral model of HC, we found that specific cognitive phenomena (the perceived likelihood of having an illness and body-focused attention) were uniquely linked with hypochondriacal behavior (medical utilization and safety-seeking). Future research is needed to identify more specific cognition-behavior links in HC (as has been done in panic disorder; e.g., Salkovskis, Clark, & Gelder, 1996) which would help clinicians better identify specific safety behaviors to be eliminated as a means of modifying catastrophic cognitions. Whereas our findings speak to factors that maintain severe health anxiety, additional research is also needed to understand variables contributing to the development of this problem. It is hoped that continued research in this area will lead to more effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of HC.",
