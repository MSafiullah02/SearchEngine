Regardless of clinical presentation, M bovis is intrinsically resistant to pyrazinamide, a key first-line anti-tuberculosis drug, necessitating a 9 month instead of a 6 month treatment duration and alternative medications.12 Furthermore, in some cases, M bovis is now resistant to streptomycin too, which is likely to contribute to its high mortality.7, 13 The increase in M bovis drug resistance might result from the overuse of antibiotics in livestock husbandry, and could foreshadow future challenges in human tuberculosis treatment and control.",

For example, millions of people in east and north Africa regularly consume unpasteurised camel milk, for the purpose of food and medical therapeutics. Pasteurisation changes both the taste and perceived bodily effects of this milk, and many people fear that incorporation of large mobile livestock into industrialised farms could also decimate their economic and cultural value. Furthermore, livestock in Africa are frequently herded outside industrialised farms, slaughtered outside regulated abattoirs, exchanged within informal livestock and food markets, transported transnationally across huge geographical spaces, and treated outside well equipped veterinary health facilities.",
