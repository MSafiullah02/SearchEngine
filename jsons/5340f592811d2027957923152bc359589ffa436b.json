It also presents the challenge of determining which operations are truly elective and which operations should continue being performed during this crisis. Additionally, despite guidance, there have been several reports of major academic centers continuing to perform elective procedures as recently as March 21, 2020 4 , potentially because of the plethora of sources providing guidance in addition to the rapidly evolving nature of the outbreak. In light of guidance coming from a variety of sources, we seek to communicate the current guidelines published by each state, to provide discussion on the impact of guidelines on orthopaedic surgery, and to provide the general framework for determining which procedures have been canceled or postponed at our institution.",

Tiers 1, 2, and 3 designate low, intermediate, and high-acuity procedures, respectively, whereas the designations \"a\" and \"b\" indicate healthy and unhealthy patients. CMS recommends postponing all Tier-1 operations, to consider postponing Tier-2 operations, and to continue performing Tier-3 operations. Specific orthopaedic operations that are mentioned include carpal tunnel releases (Tier 1a), \"hip, knee replacement and elective spine surgery\" (Tier 2a), and \"most cancers\" and \"highly symptomatic patients\" (Tier 3a). No guidance is provided on what is considered a \"highly symptomatic patient.\" 2 Certainly, patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, osteoarthritis, and other orthopaedic conditions that in normal times necessitate \"elective surgery\" may have severe symptoms, creating even more ambiguity.",

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine issued an order to cancel elective procedures in order to protect patients and providers, preserve critically short supplies of PPE, and preserve inpatient bed capacity and other equipment for critically ill patients 25 . Following this mandate, in an attempt to provide a consistent approach throughout the state, the Ohio Hospital Association (OHA) developed criteria intended to be used throughout the state for determining which procedures should be canceled. The OHA asked that each hospital and surgery center cancel procedures that did not meet any of the following criteria: \"threat to the patient's life if surgery or procedure is not performed, threat of permanent dysfunction of an extremity or organ system, risk of metastasis or progression of staging, risk of rapidly worsening to severe symptoms (time sensitivity).\" 35 Our institution determined that it would apply those principles and postpone operations, specifically, those scheduled for the next 30 days, that were not time-sensitive according to this definition.",

It is very likely that in the event that resources become more scarce, surgeons may be required to postpone treatments beyond what we would consider usual. A mechanism for review of scheduled cases is in place at our institution to ensure that patients are getting care that is appropriate to our institutional capabilities. Additionally, as the pandemic evolves, a potential way to further classify procedures is by separating them into 2 categories: (1) those that need to be performed within 2 weeks and (2) those that need to be performed within 4 weeks. This distinction would be helpful as resources become scarce and more clear guidelines are needed.",
