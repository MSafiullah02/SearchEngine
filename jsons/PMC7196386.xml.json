Consequently, the focus of this review article is, firstly attributed to debating the relationship between conflicts and tourism, their theoretical underpinning and the issues of vulnerability and resilience; secondly, it focusses on conflict destinations and their implications for the development of frameworks for crises management while proposing a holistic framework for post-conflict destinations.",

The review reflects a growing interest across the academic community in this research area given the major implications that crises have on the tourism industry. The authors acknowledge that extant research may have been undertaken on specific disasters and crisis published in journals worldwide and online, but focus in this review was on 63 tourism studies specifically focused on natural and human-induced disasters that occurred in both developed as well as less-developed countries, and were published in peer-reviewed journals (see Fig. 1\nand Appendix 1).",

Disasters were included given that not all disasters are naturally occurring. This review was purposely limited to the top three academic tourism journals (based on UK's Chartered Association of Business Schools Journal Ranking 2018) namely Annals of Tourism Research, Tourism Management, and Journal of Travel Research. Between 1999 and 2019, some 39 articles (18 in Tourism Management, 9 in Annals of Tourism Research, 12 in Journal of Travel Research) discussed crises management. This was reduced to 14 based on the eligibility of: (1) a specific keywords search for \u201cCrisis\u201d, \u201cManagement\u201d AND \u201cFramework\u201d in the journal article's title, abstract and keywords; (2) a 1999\u20132019 time frame; and (3) relevance of the paper to the analysis of tourism crisis management frameworks and models. In order to reflect the wide range of research in the field of crisis management and frameworks applied in tourism, a further six articles were identified from other sources following a \u201csnowball\u201d approach. The identification and selection of these six peer-reviewed articles was realised through a process of screening based on frequency of citations (e.g., McKercher, 2008; Mckercher & Tung, 2015) and relevance to the analysis. These included work by Evans and Elphick (2005), de Sausmarez (2007), Scott, Laws & Prideaux (2007), Sonmez and Graefe (1998), Pennington-Gray, Schroeder & Gale (2014) and Jiang & Ritchie (2017) (see Appendix 2).",

To a certain extent, there is a degree of \u2018predictability\u2019 with a crises. In contrast, Prideaux, Laws and Faulkner (2003, p.478) argue that a disaster is an \u201cunpredictable catastrophic change that can normally only be responded to after the event, either by deploying contingency plans already in place or through reactive response\u201d.

An analysis of current crisis management approaches in tourism demonstrates the need for a different perspective in managing tourism crises due to the likely complex and chaotic nature of these events. What is more, tourism seems to behave in a non-linear, non-deterministic and dynamic manner (Baggio, 2008; McKercher, 1999), with a complex set of relationships existing between and within the tourism destinations. Hence, a complexity-based perspective on tourism crises as an alternative to a more conventional approach to tourism destination management may provide a better understanding of tourism crises management and planning.",

            "text": "Accordingly, advocates of complexity and chaos theory suggest that more attention should be given in tourism research: to explore nonlinear and less linear (or quasi-linear) relationships; to unusual events that may initiate change rather than regular cases and situations; and to \u201cturbulence\u201d (Faulkner, 2000) rather than stability (Baggio, 2008; Farrell & Twining-Ward, 2004; Farsari et al., 2011; McDonald, 2009; Speakman, 2017). A destination is hence recognised as an unstable, dynamic system which is subject to non-linear relationships (Scott & Laws, 2005). Any triggering internal and external events, either natural or human-induced, can challenge the existent structure of the tourism destination and redirect it into new dynamic paths. The characteristics of the dynamic systems thus make it impossible to accurately forecast any long-term future evolution, especially when the system is on the \u201cedge of chaos\u201d or moves from one phase to another (Baggio & Sainaghi, 2011). Additionally, non-linear dynamic systems are capable of demonstrating self-organisation and chaos (Baggio, 2008). This capacity occurs even though these systems are deterministic, which means that their future behaviour is entirely determined by their initial conditions without any random terms or elements involved. This behaviour is called deterministic chaos (or simply chaos) referring to this as \u201cthe irregular (chaotic) motion generated by a system whose evolution is governed by dynamic laws that uniquely determine the state of the system at all times from a knowledge of the system's previous history\u201d (Baggio, 2008, p.7).",

If successful, the crisis enters a resolution stage, returning to a state of \u2018business as usual\u2019 (Paraskevas, 2006). However, new and coherent structures and patterns may emerge (Speakman, 2017), and thus a return to normality is not necessarily feasible or desired. \u201cButterfly effect\u201d refers to situations when minor changes can lead to a chain of reaction that culminates in larger outcomes (Faulkner, 2000; Russell & Faulkner, 2004; McKercher, 1999). An example of this being Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption in Iceland in 2010 and the impact it had on global aviation industry. According to McKercher (1999), in a tourism context, the butterfly effect explains how similar destinations can evolve in different ways, reflecting the unpredictable nature of tourism development where small changes in the initial conditions can lead to completely different outcomes. Lastly, \u2018lock-in-effect\u2019 relates to the persistence of certain inherited innovations regardless of the changes in the system. For example, why certain heritages in the past have survived despite changes in the original conditions that made them necessary (Faulkner & Russell, 1997; McKercher, 1999). Chaos theory has utility for better understanding the turbulent and challenging relationships that can form during a crisis and disaster (see Boukas & Ziakas, 2014; Speakman & Sharpley, 2012).",

Santana (2004) and Scott and Laws (2005) emphasised the conceptualisation of crisis and disaster in terms of a systems perspective considering that tourism networks are interconnected. In this context, the influence of unintended events or crises on tourism systems can create tensions that lead to systemic restructuring (Boukas & Ziakas, 2014; Faulkner, 2000). Although the plausibility of a chaos-complexity approach is still under debate (Speakman, 2017), tourism destinations functioning \u201con the edge of chaos\u201d could deal with and be better prepared to reduce the impacts caused by crises through \u201cself-organisation\u201d, \u201clearning\u201d (innovation) and \u201ctransformation to a more desirable trajectory\u201d (Davoudi, Brooks, & Mehmood, 2013, p.307), as a means to improve destination resilience. A \u2018desirable trajectory\u2019 is perhaps being over-optimistic here and perhaps one should be approaching resilience from a standpoint of ensuring some future \u2018realistic trajectory\u2019. For destinations that have faced long-protracted conflict such as Northern Ireland and Sri Lanka; compared to a short-term period of turbulence such as Egypt during the Arab Spring, that realism is often driven by what is best to save and where the focus must be, namely maintaining a lower level of accommodation stock and protecting heritage assets (Boyd, 2019a). In light of this view, there is much merit in examining the role that resilience theory and thinking offers to facilitate any \u2018realistic trajectory\u2019, especially as they offer scope to reduce vulnerability in any given system, in this case, the tourism destination region.",

Adaptive capacities and the actions required for each type of change needs a tailored response. Consequently, resilience needs to deal with a specific set of issues depending on the type of changes and level of tourism involvement. This is evidenced in Lew's (2014) scale, change and resilience model for tourism and resilience planning. The model is centred on the idea that different groups (private entrepreneurs, local and regional governments) have a different focus in addressing resilience issues. Their perception and implicit management of slow change is different than under sudden major shocks to these systems. This results in the need for different modes of response and planning within affected tourism destinations.",

However, they found that a country's political regime, its dependence on tourism and level of national income does have an influence on tourism destination resilience to terrorism. Crouch and Ritchie (1999) outlined a series of determining factors that can affect a destination, usually beyond the control or influence of the tourism sector. These include the location, cost of a destination and dependencies between destinations, as location cannot be changed and cost is largely driven by socio-economic and global forces. The effects of war in one part of the world can affect and disturb tourism industries far from the origin of conflict. Adger (2000) found that the disruption to livelihoods and loss of security for local communities due to war or civil conflict, accentuate social vulnerability.",

A system's vulnerability to crises and also the effectiveness of its recovery efforts may differ in ways, and for reasons which are yet to be fully understood (Scott et al., 2007). However, a resilient system adapts to change by building adaptive capacity in the face of unanticipated and anticipated disruptions. This is a critical ability for a tourism system since conflicts, and respectively political instability, unlike natural disasters, impact the tourism industry and the image of a destination more significantly and for longer periods of time (Pizam & Mansfeld, 2005). They affect the capacity of tourism destinations to adapt to changes and \u2018bounce-back\u2019 from crises.

Over the years, research has mainly focussed on producing prescriptive models describing the stages of a crisis in order to assist understanding in proactive and strategic crises management (Ritchie, 2009). Moreover, Hall (2010) argued that tourism crisis management has concentrated on economic and financial crises, and crisis events such as 9/11 or unexpected oil shocks. This raises the question as \u201cto the reactive nature of tourism research versus the development of greater predictive capacity and theory generation\u201d (Hall, 2010, p.406). While the focus pre 2010 was selective, researchers over the past decade have addressed environmental crises from the standpoint of environmental sustainability, environmental change and adaptation (Kutzner, 2019) and building organizational and enterprise resilience (Biggs et al., 2019). Other scholars have examined particular environmental catastrophes such as oil spills from the Deepwater Horizon (Pennington-Gray, London, Cahyanto, & Klages, 2011) and the challenges of conservation regarding the Great Barrier Reef (Biggs, Ban, & Hall, 2012). The latter evidence of research suggests movement towards being more proactive and predictive.",

For instance, Fink (1986) considered that a crisis follows four stages that are categorised prodromal (warning), acute (at the height of the crisis), chronic (aftermath), and resolution. Faulkner's (2001) tourism disaster management framework is a composite set of stages based on earlier research of Fink (1986) and Roberts (1994). The latter identified specific stages of responding to a flood. According to Faulkner (2001), a crisis follows six stages. The process commences with a \u201cpre-event phase\u201d, when action can be taken to prevent or mitigate the consequences of a disaster, followed by a \u201cprodromal\u201d state in which the disaster is imminent. The \u201cemergency phase\u201d refers to the time when actions are taken to protect life and property, followed by an \u201cintermediate phase\u201d, a \u201clong-term recovery phase\u201d and a \u201cresolution phase\u201d in which routine is restored or a new improved state emerges. His tourism crises management model also includes a list of responses to each of these phases alongside management strategies, updated risk assessment and contingency plans.",

Since Faulkner's model, there has emerged a body of scholarly work on frameworks and models that have a broad research focus, addressing a multiplicity of concepts and aspects (see Fig. 3\n). Some of the models analysed consider crises as having a distinct start and finish with a desirable end of a crisis as a return to normality. This idea is supported by the use of crisis stages to divide time into a before (pre-crisis) and after (post-crisis). Scott and Laws (2005) and Scott et al., (2007) argue that an alternative systems perspective offers a better representation of a crisis. A crisis is thus seen as an evolving system where change (both positive and negative) is endemic and not limited to only its immediate temporal or geographic locality. In addition, these changes cannot be planned as part of a strategic management as they also may lead to different stages. As a result, the subsequent system may be different than the previous one and, consequently, a return to normality is not always the required endpoint (Scott & Laws, 2005).",

For instance, the legacy of the Yugoslavian wars contributed to the production of local cultural heritage through the \u201ctouristification\u201d of war memory as found in Sarajevo (Causevic, 2010). In Rwanda, the 1994 genocide memorial sites are increasingly incorporated into the country's tourist product in order to bring a sense of common heritage and a shared purpose between former conflictive parties and help reconciliation and healing (Friedrich & Johnston, 2013). In the case of Northern Ireland, many private sector tourism providers offer educational background to visitors to learn about the conflict and the effects of peace in a divided society (Boyd, 2000; Boyd, 2019b; Simone-Charteris & Boyd, 2010) by connecting the tourist with dark sites and dissonant territory that often divides communities (Boyd, 2016).",

According to Causevic and Lynch (2011), tourism in post-conflict areas undergoes a stage of \u201ctransformation of the feelings\u201d, the so-called \u201cphoenix\u201d phase that attempts at reconciliation between communities and normalisation of social relationships. This places greater emphasis on local communities and their role in re-creating and deciding how heritage in post-conflict areas is presented (Zhang, 2017). Others view Phoenix tourism as a distinct early stage in post-conflict tourism development, where tourism products are deliberately and commercially developed for economic benefit (Boyd, 2016, Boyd, 2019a, Boyd, 2019b). As such \u201cPhoenix\u201d thinking is part of the wider process of tourism development in post-conflict areas, and forms part of a wider post-conflict recovery (Boyd, 2019a, Boyd, 2019b).

Second, while adaptive systems thinking has been applied to tourism management (Farrell & Twining-Ward, 2004; Ritchie, 2004), it has not been considered in situations of conflict and political instability. Such an approach enables a deeper understanding of the change process. Third, with a few exceptions (e.g., Novelli, Morgan, & Nibigira, 2012; Boukas & Ziakas, 2014; Dahles & Susilowati, 2015; Buultjens, Ratnayake & Gnanapala, 2016), there has been a notable absence of consideration of complexity theory and resilience thinking to situational cases of political instability and armed conflict. Resilience from a tourism perspective, has been predominantly linked to natural disasters and economic crises, sustainability and climate change research. There is, however, scope to explore the synergy between the application of complex adaptive systems and resilience theory and then apply these to crises. Fourth, there is a lack of research that examines crises from a nonlinear perspective. Too much emphasis has been on the development of \u2018deterministic models\u2019 (McKercher, 1999). Crises involve different stages and are often unpredictable and evolving phenomena that can cause restructuring of entire tourism systems. This requires a different approach, offering new paradigms and theoretical frameworks to be developed that conceptualise a tourism crises as a dynamic phenomenon. Fifth, there is an absence of crises research that is holistic (supply and demand focused) and integrative (more involvement needed with stakeholders who feel marginalised; e.g., local communities). Finally, while research has examined the use of the label \u2018Phoenix tourism\u2019, much of this has been descriptive and conceptual allowing scope for more theoretical and empirical research to be undertaken.",

The outcomes that can be triggered by major disturbances are characterised as high magnitude and of long duration (e.g., conflicts and political instability). The framework also adopts a systems approach towards understanding a tourism system, its sub-systems (socio-ecological, socio-technical and socio-political) and the interactions between these responding to change (positive or negative) by self-organising. This self-organising can be either through adoption of a Phoenix state directly after conflict has ceased, a state where there is openness to new approaches, innovation and learning or it can be through reorganisation which leads to a tourism system with characteristics that resemble mature destinations that have never experienced conflict (see Boyd, 2019a, Boyd, 2019b).

The former applies to Northern Ireland where the focus was on development of a dark heritage product of murals and dissonance community heritage that as a product base contrasted with a more diversified tourism offer by tourism bodies, which would later see niche development normalise around food tourism, screen tourism and golf tourism (Boyd, 2019b). A Phoenix phase of development can also be noted for Medellin, Colombia, with its focus on narco heritage, the development of new tourism products such as comuna tours (peripheral neighbourhoods), and the dark romanticism of Pablo tours (Naef, 2018). This narrow Phoenix base contrasts with wider opportunity to develop bird-based (avian) tourism in Colombia recognised to have the greatest bird diversity of any country in the world.",

This paper therefore offered the opportunity to first present a review of the scope of this research field, but second to put forward the case to reconceptualise our understanding of the nature of a crises from a multi-perspective, drawing from systems theory, chaos, complexity theory, and utilising concepts from ecological (resilience) and social (vulnerability) theory. Adopting this broad-based perspective offers scholars the opportunity to view a destination that has faced, or is facing, a crisis as an adaptive system that highlights its capacity to respond to change, overcome vulnerability and be resilient.",

            "text": "This new approach has been put forward as a conceptual framework. While it has been specifically applied to one sub-type of crises, that of conflict, it has wider utility to other types of crises. Key here is how a destination adapts (adaptive capacity), moves directly to exhibit the characteristics of mature destinations that have never faced any past major disturbance, or adopts a transitory \u2018Phoenix\u2019 phase of initial recovery. What is important in the framework is the role that vulnerability and resilience play. As discussed previously, the framework offers considerable scope for new research to test empirically the nature of relationships that exist between different component parts. The authors invite scholarly research into investigating casual linkages as well as operationalising the framework in varied conflict\u2013ridden destinations. For instance, those that have faced a long protracted image crises and subsequent conflict (e.g., Israel-Palestine) compared to those that have faced the re-emergence of short-duration conflict (e.g., Egypt during the Arab Spring, and recent Easter violence and unrest in Sri Lanka). The authors are cognizant that crises vary in their duration and their intensity and that the wider applicability of some aspects of the framework will vary according to the destination and conflict under study. Destinations where conflict has re-emerged but where that has been short in duration can be examined from the standpoint of their ability to be adaptive, resilient to and quickly recover to a condition similar to what they enjoyed prior to conflict. In contrast, for destinations that have been torn apart by protracted civil war, there exist greater scope to research how such destinations began their recovery and the extent to which this relied on an interim Phoenix stage.",

Policy makers need to be able to explore different strategies of response, where a \u2018Phoenix\u2019 phased recovery is favoured or not. This may involve developing appropriate crisis communication strategies that help to facilitate repositioning as well as evaluating tourist reactions on how successful they see those recovery strategies to be, and how they shape the type of tourism development taking place. Local communities and their voices need better understanding, especially if the recovery strategy is to have some deliberate association with the past conflict. The inputs from these different stakeholder groups will inform researchers of the characteristics of a Phoenix type destination or one that normalises around its recovery and renewal. Crises are unwelcome events facing tourism. Regarding conflicts as crises, adopting a holistic and multi-perspective framework offers researchers with much needed insight into how destinations can develop and manage post-conflict.",
