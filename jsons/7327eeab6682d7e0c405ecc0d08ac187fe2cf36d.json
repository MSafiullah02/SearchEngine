To our knowledge, rHMPV-Pa remains the only HMPV vaccine that has been evaluated in clinical trials. Although rHMPV-Pa was immunogenic and protective against HMPV challenge in NHPs [12] , this experimental vaccine was overattenuated (i.e., insufficiently infectious and immunogenic in HMPV-seronegative children). Thus, although preclinical studies can identify appropriate vaccine candidates, careful stepwise assessment in clinical trials is essential. The results of this study also highlight the need for placebo-controlled trials and assessment for adventitious viral infections in young children, because respiratory illnesses occur frequently in this population [15] . Future efforts to develop a live attenuated HMPV vaccine are warranted. Our data on rHMPV-Pa provide preclinical benchmarks that will help identify other vaccine candidates that are less attenuated. These candidates might include, for example, rHMPV-Na, which bears the AMPV N gene rather than the AMPV P gene and was shown to be less attenuated than rHMPV-Pa in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of NHPs [12] ; HMPV with deletion of the SH or G gene, which was shown to be less attenuated in the upper (\u2206SH and \u2206G) and lower (\u2206SH) respiratory tracts of NHPs than rHMPV-Pa [16] ; and HMPV bearing point mutations designed from comparable mutations in RSV, which have not yet been evaluated in NHPs.",
