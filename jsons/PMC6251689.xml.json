We examined the discriminatory performance of PCT using cutoffs from decision algorithms used for adults with CAP [6, 8, 15, 16]. Diagnostic test measures including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic likelihood ratios were calculated for PCT cutoffs of <0.1, <0.25, <0.5, <1, and <2 ng/mL. Due to frequent use of the <0.25 ng/mL cutoff in the adult literature, this threshold was selected for a majority of the comparisons. To assess the discriminatory power of PCT concentration in distinguishing patients with typical bacterial from other pathogen detections, multivariable logistic regression models were developed in which the dependent variable was defined as the presence or absence of a typical bacterial detection. Ten-fold cross-validation was performed. In brief, this involved splitting the dataset into 10 equal partitions. The model was fitted using 9 of the partitions and tested on the remaining partition. This process was repeated 10 times with each partition tested exactly once. Model results were then averaged across the 10 runs to produce a single estimate. Receiver operating curve (ROC) plots were also developed. All statistical analyses were performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",

Elevated serum PCT concentrations have been most strongly associated with bacteremic CAP [17, 18]. Studies in children have been less conclusive. Two pediatric studies from Sweden [19, 20] found limited association between PCT concentrations and detected pathogens in CAP; however, other studies have shown a reasonable correlation, with the highest levels again in bacteremic CAP [13, 21]. Limitations to earlier studies include reliance on insensitive methods such as culture or bacterial serology for etiologic diagnosis and the use of first generation PCT assays with a detection limit of 0.5 ng/mL, above the range in which viral pneumonia and mild bacterial disease can be distinguished [22]. More recent studies, including ours, have used PCT assays with an improved range, but only a few have combined this with modern methods of pathogen detection [23]. Our study extends prior works by evaluating the predictive value of PCT for CAP etiology using a highly sensitive PCT assay in a cohort of children with CAP with extensive laboratory testing including modern molecular methods [2].",

Of note, 65% of children with PCT concentrations \u22650.5 ng/mL had only a viral or atypical pathogen detected. Current methods to identify typical bacteria causing nonbacteremic pneumonia are limited. For children with PCT concentrations \u22650.5 ng/mL and only viral or atypical pathogens detected, we cannot be certain that the elevated PCT does not represent undetected bacterial coinfection; in some studies, PCT concentrations \u22650.5 ng/mL have been considered presumptive evidence of bacterial CAP [27]. Despite the overlap at the high end of the PCT concentration range, however, at the low end (<0.1 ng/mL) there were no detections of typical bacterial pathogens. More importantly, children with bacterial-viral codetections had elevated PCT concentrations, which were actually higher (but not statistically different) than those in children with bacterial detections alone. With only 54 patients with typical bacteria detected, our data do not exclude the possibility that viral coinfection could lower PCT concentrations in children with bacterial coinfection. However, our data suggest that a very low PCT concentration can accurately identify children at extremely low risk of typical bacterial infection. Furthermore, only 9 children with a PCT concentration 0.1 to <0.25 ng/mL had a typical bacterial pathogen detected (Table 6). Although PCT results were not available to the clinicians, 4 of these 9 children did not receive antibiotic therapy for CAP; none were readmitted to the same healthcare system after discharge. Thus, the role of the identified bacteria in the illness of these children is uncertain.",

In the EPIC study, bacterial pathogens were detected in 15% of children with CAP, and only 8% were typical bacterial pathogens [2], yet 88% received inpatient antibiotics. In the current analysis, 46% of children had a PCT <0.25 ng/mL, 84% of whom received inpatient antibiotics. A PCT <0.1 ng/mL had a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI, 94\u2013100), potentially preventing antibiotic exposure in 23% of children. The negative predictive value of a PCT concentration <0.25 ng/mL was 96% (95% CI, 91\u201398), potentially limiting antibiotic use in 46% of children. To optimize the treatment of children hospitalized with CAP while reducing unnecessary and potentially harmful antibiotic use, clinicians will likely need to integrate PCT with other predictors of outcome and rapid etiologic diagnosis. Patterns of immune response identified by expression profiling may ultimately replace individual biomarkers to differentiate viral from bacterial and mixed infections [29, 30].",

Not all children enrolled in EPIC were included in this study; however, all children with typical bacteria detected from the 2 children\u2019s hospitals participating in this study were included. Despite extensive testing, 9% of children with CAP had no etiology determined. Based on the continued difficulty in identifying bacterial causes of CAP, it is possible that some children without a typical bacterial pathogen detected were infected with bacteria, particularly those with high PCT. Over 87% of patients in this study received inpatient antibiotics, including 83% of those with only a viral pathogen detected, which may have hampered bacterial detection. Many children did not have residual serum available for PCT analysis; children with residual serum available were more frequently admitted to the ICU than other EPIC enrolled children. Because the prevalence of bacterial detections and severe disease were higher in our study sample, our estimate of the positive predictive value of PCT for these characteristics may be higher than what would have been observed for the entire EPIC cohort. Because PCT testing was not standard of care, serum collection occurred a median of 1 day (IQR, 0\u20131) after admission; we observed no correlation between time of serum collection and PCT concentrations overall and when stratified by etiology (data not shown). Finally, some studies suggest serial testing increases accuracy in the correlation between PCT concentration and etiologic diagnosis, but we did not perform serial monitoring.",

Implementation studies and clinical trials of PCT-guided therapy could significantly improve the care of children with CAP by decreasing the use of unnecessary antibiotics.",
