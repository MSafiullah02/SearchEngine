            "text": "The SIR evolutionary model predicts too sharp a decrease of the fractions of people infected with COVID-19 in France after the start of the national lockdown, compared to what is observed. I introduce three extensions to these models to fit the daily arrivals in French hospitals, as well in critical care, releases and deaths. These models involve ratios of evolutionary timescales to branching fractions, assumed uniform throughout a country, and the basic reproduction number, R 0 , before and during the national lockdown, for each region of France. The hospital data are well fit by the models with the exception of the arrivals in critical care, which are found to decrease in time faster than predicted by all models. This suggests that hospitals have learnt over time to better treat COVID-19 patients without resorting to critical care. The basic reproductive factor, averaged over France, was R 0 = 3.4 \u00b1 0.1 before the lockdown and 0.65 \u00b1 0.04 (90% c.l.) during the lockdown, both with small regional variations. On 11 May 2020, the Infection Fatality Rate in France is 4 \u00b1 1% (90% c.l.) and constant, while the Feverish vastly outnumber the Asymptomatic, contrary to the early phases. Without the lockdown nor social distancing, over 2 million deaths from COVID-19 would have occurred throughout France. The fraction of immunized people reached a plateau below 1% throughout France (3% in Paris) by late April 2020 (95% c.l.), suggesting a lack of herd immunity and that a second wave of the pandemic is possible during the partial lifting of the national lockdown. After the partial lifting of the lockdown, if R 0 is as high as 1.5, then a second wave will lead to 60 thousand deaths by mid-July and over a million by October, while if R 0 is 1.2 or lower, the pandemic is delayed with deaths rising as late as August, allowing for timely governmental response.",

            "text": "The current COVID-9 pandemic of infection and deaths caused by the SARS-2 virus is affecting all countries. Among these, France has been severely affected, with over 25 thousand deaths. In any seriously life-threatening pandemic as COVID-19 is in France, it is crucial to assess the parameters of the pandemic: 1) the timescales between different phases, e.g. the incubation timescale between the exposure to the virus and the arrival of the first symptoms, 2) the branching fractions, for example, what fraction of the population that catches the virus eventually develops symptoms, 3) the basic reproduction number, termed R 0 , which measures the number of people infected by a single contagious person. With these quantities, one can estimate the evolution in time of fractions of infectious people, people in hospitals, in particular those in critical care, and immunized people. These fractions are important as they enable national and regional health authorities plan for lockdown measures to prevent too many deaths, as well as to prevent saturation of the hospitals, especially given the limits in numbers of critical care units.",

            "text": "Several such studies have been performed for France. Massonnaud et al. (2020) use a SEIR model with fixed hypotheses on R 0 to forecast the short-term hospital needs. Roques et al. (2020) also used an SIRD model, which they fit to the combination of confirmed cases (presumably from hospital sources) and deaths, as well as number of tested persons from another database. Their fits were restricted to before the French lockdown. This led them to conclude that the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR) is roughly 0.5%, or perhaps double accounting for deaths outside of hospitals. They also found R 0 = 3.2 \u00b1 0.1 (95% confidence). Two studies extended SEIR models not only to handle deaths, but also split the Infectious phase into Hospitalized and Critical (Unlu et al., 2020) or with four extra sub-phases within the Infectious phase (Di Domenico et al., 2020) . Unlu et al. fit to the daily deaths data and determine R 0 = 3.56 before lockdown and R 0 = 0.74 during lockdown (without uncertainties). Di Domenico et al. fit the daily hospital and critical care arrivals for the Paris (\u00cele de France) region. Using 3 age classes, they introduce age-mixing matrices before and during lockdown. Their model assumed fixed branching ratios. Their analysis led to R 0 = 3.0 \u00b1 0.2 before lockdown, and R 0 = 0.68 \u00b1 0.06 during lockdown, with both values at 95% confidence. Salje et al. (2020) used a different approach than extended SIR or SEIR models, by following individual trajectories of hospitalized patients. They also split the patients by sex and age group. Salje et al. considered the delays in reporting of the data, assumed that the time from hospital arrival to death for those who do not survive is a mixture model of an exponential distribution for rapid deaths and a log-normal for slower ones. Their model involves a contact matrix between people of different age groups, which was known before the pandemic, and which they modeled after the lockdown. They obtained R 0 factors before lockdown of R 0 = 3.3 \u00b1 0.13 (national model) and R 0 = 3.4 \u00b1 0.1 (regional model), as well as R 0 = 0.52 \u00b1 0.03 during lockdown (both models), with 95% confidence uncertainties. They also estimate the IFR at 0.7% and that roughly 4% of the population is Immunized on 11 May 2020.",

My models differ from previous ones, by considering different R 0 values per geographic zone, while assuming that the evolutionary timescales and branching fractions are independent of the geographic zone, i.e. that the population is genetically homogeneous. I can then estimate how many people would have died in France without the lockdown, how many deaths could have been prevented had the lockdown been enforced 10 days earlier (two days after March 5, when the situation of the pandemic in France was clearly in exponential growth with a full region -around Mulhouse -infected). I can also estimate regional disparities in pre-lockdown and lockdown values of R 0 , as well as the CFRs and Infectious-to-Fatality rates (IFRs) both nationally and per geographic zone. Contrary to previous models, my model does not assume that the timescales for evolution on one or another of two branches are the same. But while my model is less restrictive on the parameters, we shall see that it provides fairly low uncertainties on the R 0 factors and on the evolution in time even in the future.",

Therefore, instead of a popular conception that duration of infection is constant, it follows instead an exponential distribution in the SIR model. This explains why a 15-day fully-efficient lockdown is insufficient to eradicate a virus. This is illustrated in Figure 2 , which shows the distribution of infectious times for 3 models: exponential (as in SIR), single-valued (as many people na\u00efvely believe) and a gamma distribution that corresponds to the convolution of two identical exponential distributions. At 3 times the mean Infectious duration, the fraction of remaining Infectious is 5% in the exponential model and 0.6% in the gamma model. Quarantine times are set to ensure that nearly all Infectious recover, but one should remember that in models where the distribution of the infectious time is exponential or convolutions of exponentials, there is always a small fraction of Infectious that remain so at the end of the quarantine.",

The hospital data for all of France (right panel) indicates instead that both the new cases and daily Removed keep increasing after the start of the lockdown for roughly 14 and 25 days, respectively.

The code was written in Python 3, and the marginal distributions of the free parameters were estimated from the posteriors using the emcee package Goodman & Weare (2010). The MCMC procedure involved a minimum of number of chains (or \"walkers\") equal to twice the number of free parameters, with a minimum of 64 (for single-zone models), and up to 119 for 15-region models, and up to near 600 for 96-department runs. The chains (walkers) are advanced using the stretch move algorithm (Goodman & Weare, 2010) . These chains were initialized with uniform sampling over the allowed range of parameters shown in Table 4 .4. The chains were run for 200 000 steps (single zone) or 50 000 steps (15 regions), thus involving a total of several million evaluations of the set of differential equations. I assumed 80% burnin factor, thus only considering the last 20% of each chain for the analysis. The figures showing curves, use medians for the curves with shaded regions for 16-84% and 5-95% confidence levels. Figure 7 shows the goodness of fit of single-zone France for the SEIHCDRO and SEAFHCDRO models. The daily hospitalizations (magenta), deaths (black) and releases (green) are well fit by the models, especially for the SEAFHCDRO model (right), while the SEIHCDRO model predicts too early a peak in daily hospital arrivals. However, the daily arrivals in critical care are poorly fit by the models, which cannot reproduce the early narrow peak in the last days of March, followed by the rapid decrease. One also notices that the mean values of the post-burnin marginal distributions of R 0 lead to very high values before the lockdown: R 0 = 6 (the allowed upper limit) for model SEIRHCDRO and R 0 = 4.24 \u00b1 0.1 for model SEAFHCDRO. At the same time, the values during lockdown are found to be very small: R 0 = 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.01 \u00b1 0.02 for SEIRHCDRO and SEAFHCDRO, respectively. Figure 8 shows the same trends for the city of Paris, when running models SEIHCDRO (left) and SEAFHC-DRO (right) with the 15 regions. One notices the same poorly-fit data for the arrivals in critical care as for all of France. Since France contributes roughly 10% of France in terms of critical care arrivals, this suggests that the dichotomy between model predictions and data for critical care arrivals is general throughout France (not shown in the figures). This dichotomy with the models cannot be caused by saturated critical care, because it occurs in all regions, while only a few suffered from critical care unit saturation. Interestingly, a hospital official mentioned that France has learned how to better treat COVID-19 patients and has been sending progressively smaller fractions to critical care. 2 With joint modeling of 15 regions, the R 0 values before and during lockdown are respectively lower and higher than for single-Zone France, suggesting that the lockdown is less effective than for single-zone France, where R 0 is reduced by a factor of at least 30. For Paris, the R 0 factors before lockdown are R 0 = 2.65 \u00b1 0.20 for SEIHCDRO and R 0 = 3.5 \u00b1 0.2 for SEAFHCDRO. At the same time, the lockdown values of R 0 is not as low for Paris than for the single-zone France model: R 0 = 0.91 \u00b1 0.05 and R 0 = 0.65 \u00b1 0.20 for models SEIHCDRO and SEAFHCDRO, respectively.

The fits remain good for the daily Hospital arrivals (magenta) and the hospital Releases (green), but now fail somewhat to describe the decrease in the daily deaths (black).

The time for strong symptoms to appear, T A\u2192F , is shorter than 10 days. The time to recover from the Feverish phase, T F\u2192O is large, or else the fraction of Feverish that end up Hospitalized is near unity, which seems less likely. Several marked differences appear between the two models: The ratio T F\u2192H /f F\u2192H is less than 3.5 days for SEAFHDRO in contrast to less than 18 days for SEAFHCDRO. And the time for Asymptomatics to recover, T A\u2192O , is less than 2 days for SEAFHCDRO, but possibly as long as 100 days for SEAFHDRO. Finally, while the time from Critical to Death is shorter than 6 days in the SEAFHCDRO model, the ratio T H\u2192D /f H\u2192D is peaked at 100 days (the allowed maximum, see Table 4 .4).

This is also true for Paris, whose inhabitants knew they were at great risk because of the high population density, which may explain why its pre-lockdown R 0 is not even higher. However, there are important differences in the marginal distributions of R 0 between the 2 models, as displayed in Figure 11 . Some regions are among the lowest in pre-lockdown R 0 with SEAFHDRO, while they are among the highest with SEAFHCDRO, e.g. Paris-Petite-Ceinture and Hauts de France.

In particular, while the Feverish (orange) curves are thin in the 15-region (top) panels, they are very thick for the single-zone (bottom) ones. This difference is related to the apparent degeneracy between terms F and T F\u2192H /f F\u2192H in equation 5e. Without extra information, the degeneracy causes a strong uncertainty on the Feverish population fraction, F . But with the additional knowledge of the time-to-fraction ratios, such as T F\u2192H /f F\u2192H given by multi-zone runs, the degeneracy is lifted and the uncertainty on F is small.

If R 0 = 1 after the partial lift of the lockdown, then the situation remains stable, and the number of Dead barely increases (by 10%). If, instead, the public mingles too much, leading to a high value of R 0 = 2, then the second wave will hit the country, with a peak of the Infectious super-phase in July and a multiplication by 20 of the number of Dead, reaching 3% of the population of Paris and of France as a whole, i.e., 2 million Dead! Note that the evolution for France as a whole mimics that of each region, i.e. Paris, because not only are the ratios of timescales to branching fractions are the same between regions, as before, but now the R 0 factors are also assumed the same. If the public chooses an intermediate path, with R 0 = 1.5, then the pandemic returns less dramatically than with R 0 = 2, and is delayed (as predicted by many with the SIR model). Still, with R 0 as high as 1.5 after the partial lifting of the lockdown, the number of deaths would rise to 2% of the population, i.e. over one million deaths! Finally, if R 0 = 1.2, then the pandemic rise is very slow at the start, with the number of Dead doubling only in August. But without stronger containment, this scenario would also lead to 0.25% of deaths in France, i.e. over 150 thousand. In other words, the time of doubling the total number of deaths in France on 11 May (26 thousand) is 1, 2, or 3 months if R 0 = 2, 1.5, or 1.2. The evolution of the pandemic is therefore highly sensitive to the value of R 0 , with quiet evolution for R 0 = 1, manageable evolution for R 0 = 1.2, and increasingly fast second waves for R 0 = 1.5 and R 0 = 2. It is useful to compare the evolution of Dead and of Infectious people. The dates when the number of Infectious will multiply by 5 compared to May 11 are May 25, June 10, and July 22, for R 0 = 1.2, 1.5, and 2, respectively. Similarly, the dates when the total number of Deaths in France will be multiplied by 5 (to reach 130 000) are June 28, July 31, and October 22, for R 0 = 1.2, 1.5, and 2, respectively.

This is the consequence of the Feverish and Hospitalized dominating the Infectious super-phase on May 11, in contrast to the first-wave exponential growth when the Asymptomatic phase dominated the Infectious super-phase (see also Fig. 13 ). This is good news for the French authorities, as they can use hospital data to monitor the rise of deaths with over a month between the quintupling of hospitalizations and the quintupling of deaths, as long as R 0 \u2264 2. model; 2) it produces R 0 > 1 during lockdown for some regions. The conclusions of this study on the future evolution of the pandemic vary fairly little whether one adopts one or the other model. This study produces the first analysis of ratios of timescales to branching fractions, and indicates that the incubation phase lasts less than 8 days on average (Fig. 10) . Moreover, this study produces the first geographic analysis of the R 0 factors, both before lockdown and during the lockdown. It indicates some regional differences, with Hauts-de-France and Paris showing higher R 0 before the lockdown, with a homogenization during the lockdown. Overall, the SEAFHCDRO model leads to R 0 = 3.4 \u00b1 0.1 before and R 0 = 0.65 \u00b1 0.02 during the lockdown (with 90% confidence limits, see Table 2 ), with some regional variations (Figs. 11 and 12 ). Therefore the national lockdown contributed to decreasing the basic reproduction number by a factor of roughly 5. The pre-lockdown value above is in good agreement with the values previously reported for France: R 0 = 3.2 \u00b1 0.1 (Roques et al., 2020) , R 0 = 3.56 (Unlu et al., 2020, without uncertainties) , R 0 = 3.0 \u00b1 0.2 (Di Domenico et al., 2020) , and R 0 = 3.3 \u00b1 0.1 and 3.4 \u00b1 0.1 for the two models of (Salje et al., 2020) .

            "text": "In this work, I introduced several epidemiological models to fit the French hospital data from March 19 to early May 2020. I argue that the evolution of hospitalizations and deaths after the national lockdown of 17 March was too slow to be compatible with the SIR model (Fig. 2) . Instead I extended the SEIR model to include phases for which their exist hospital data: Hospitalized, Critical, and Released. While this SEIHCDRO model (Fig. 4) fits the data reasonably well, I found that the more complex SEAFHCDRO model (Fig. 5) , where the Infectious phase is split between Asymptomatic and Feverish phases, fits the data significantly better, even after allowing for the extra two free parameters. However, neither SEIHCDRO nor SEAFHCDRO can reproduce the rapid decrease in daily arrivals of Critical people at hospitals, which is more rapid than the corresponding decreases since lockdown in the daily Hospital arrivals, as well as daily Releases and Deaths. I then introduced the SEAFHDRO model (Fig. 6 ) that merges the Critical and Hospitalized phases, but this model produced unsatisfactory results: 1) it fits less well the decrease in the daily Deaths compared to the SEAFHCDRO Acknowledgements I am grateful to Avishai Dekel who introduced me to SIR and snowed me with his very pretty mathematical developments, Trevor Ponman for useful discussions with provocative questions, as well as Andr\u00e9 Klarsfeld, Eliott Mamon and Nick Kaiser for useful references. This work has made use of the Horizon Cluster hosted by Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris. I thank Christophe Pichon for access to this machine and St\u00e9phane Rouberol for running smoothly this cluster for me (including replying to my message on evenings and weekends). I also am very grateful to Boris Dintrans for quasi-immediate supply of substantial computing power on the OCCIGEN super-computer operated by CINES, which I unfortunately was not able to process for this study. Finally thanks to Eduardo Vitral and Matthieu Tricottet for help with Python programming and Nikos Prantzos and David Valls-Gabaud for spotting an arXiv-induced typo in eq. (1) of an earlier version. I also thank the makers of public software Python with many packages, especially Scipy, Numpy (van der Walt et al., 2011), pandas (McKinney, 2010), emcee (Goodman & Weare, 2010) , and Matplotlib (Hunter, 2007) .",
