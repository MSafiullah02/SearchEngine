            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US, and COPD exacerbations result in approximately 700,000 hospitalizations annually [1, 2]. Patients who do not respond to pharmacotherapy are placed on invasive (IMV) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV). While invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) administered through an endotracheal tube is an effective method of treating acute respiratory, it requires treatment in an intensive care unit, and places patients at risk for a wide range of complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia. NIV (continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP or Bilevel positive airway pressure, BIPAP) provides positive pressure ventilation via a face mask without the need for intubation. Multiple randomized controlled trials [3, 4], meta-analysis [5, 6], and analyses of real-world data [7, 8] have demonstrated that treatment with NIV, when added to usual care, reduces the risk of intubation, lowers the incidence of ventilator associated complications, and results in better short-term survival. Based on this evidence, NIV receives a grade A recommendation in current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines [9]. Furthermore, the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society joint guidelines [10] as well as British Thoracic Society guidelines [11] make a strong recommendation for the use of NIV as a first-line treatment for patients with COPD exacerbation and acute respiratory failure.",

In a recent study of more than 77,500 patients with COPD cared for at 400 US hospitals, median hospital percentage of NIV use among ventilated patients was 75.1% (range 9.2\u201394.1%) and the bottom 20% of hospitals offered a trial of NIV to less than half of ventilated patients [12]. More importantly, institutions with higher rates of NIV had lower IMV use and better clinical outcomes. Thus, low hospital rates of NIV in patients admitted for severe COPD represents an evidence practice gap and a missed opportunity to improve the outcomes among this vulnerable population. Appropriate delivery of NIV is a complex, multicomponent intervention that requires timely recognition, and effective communication, and coordination across multiple disciplines. Figure 1 depicts the flow for a patient who comes to the emergency department with severe COPD exacerbation and each clinician\u2019s responsibilities in the process of NIV initiation and monitoring. Only few studies have tested strategies for supporting NIV implementation. A single site, before-after study from Canada found that multidisciplinary guidelines for the use of NIV in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) were associated with greater NIV utilization but included only patients in the intensive care unit [13].\n",

Figure 2 summarizes the steps in the development of our implementation strategy to increase the use of NIV in severe COPD exacerbation. In step 1 (formative evaluation), we conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants in a sample of hospitals with high rates of NIV and good COPD outcomes (low mortality and NIV failure rates). The analysis of the interviews revealed 3 different professional identities and roles in NIV delivery: physicians, respiratory therapists (RTs), and nurses. Although several clinicians\u2019 tasks are distinct, Fig. 1 shows the connections between physicians, nurses, and RTs indicating the need for coordination to ensure optimal patient outcomes. The three groups encounter significant professional boundary issues with regards to their work responsibilities and priorities. For example, nurses were concerned about patient\u2019s inability to eat or take medications while on NIV. RTs considered that nurses do not have a good understanding of the vital role of NIV. However, the two professions agreed that when there was a shared understanding of the treatment plan and when the concerns from both sides were openly addressed, the collaboration was considerably improved. RTs perceived themselves as experts in initiating and managing NIV; in some institutions, there was a strained relation between the RTs and physicians, with RTs complaining about a lack of autonomy and the need to wait for physicians when NIV was immediately indicated. We identified the following contextual factors and strategies associated with successful NIV implementation: provider buy-in, respiratory therapists (RT) autonomy to deliver NIV independently, interdisciplinary teamwork, collegial, trusting relationships between RTs, physicians, and nurses, and ongoing staff education [15].\n",

We summarized the barriers in the TDF domains with an eye toward choosing an implementation strategy which could overcome several of the identified barriers. Eight of the 14 domains (knowledge, skills, professional roles and identity, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, environmental context and resources, social influences, and emotion) were present in the existing literature and our research.",

This creates a critical need for effective communication, conflict management, and shared mental model [20] skills that are well suited to IPE approaches [21\u201323]. By contrast, conventional education regarding NIV is administered to individual clinicians or groups of clinicians of the same discipline via lectures or online modules. Educating individual care providers in silos does not address the interprofessional collaboration inherent to NIV delivery. On the other hand, IPE competencies emphasize the importance of establishing awareness and knowledge regarding interprofessional team roles. In this way, leveraging an IPE platform enables learning via interaction between two or more professions who learn from, with, and about each other\u2019s roles and responsibilities (in this case, in regards to NIV) [24, 25].",

The training will consist of 2 modules: (1) NIV knowledge and skills: delivered by NIV experts and (2) IPE: delivered by an expert in IPE and team training. The didactic training regarding NIV use in COPD will include a review of the evidence supporting the benefits of NIV, advantages of NIV as compared to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), selection of patients, contraindications to NIV, and management of patients while on NIV including monitoring, ventilator settings, attention to patient comfort, weaning from NIV, and decision about NIV failure and need for intubation. The didactic module will emphasize the importance of early initiation of NIV in patients with severe COPD. The second half of the training will concentrate on teaching interprofessional collaboration. Specifically, the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) recommends four key competencies in successful IPE, which include roles and responsibilities, teams and teamwork, values and ethics, and interprofessional communication [26]. We selected the following core competencies for our interactive IPE. Professional roles and identity: each team member learns about abilities, tasks, duties, responsibilities, and concerns of their fellows\u2019 team members; values/ethics: work with individuals of other professions to maintain a climate of mutual respect and shared values; teams/teamwork: apply relationship-building values and the principles of team dynamics to perform effectively in different team roles to deliver patient-center care that is safe, timely, effective, and efficient [27]. Given the demands for team coordination in NIV delivery and findings in our qualitative work, we anticipate that IPE will contribute to greater RT, physician, and nurse understanding of each other\u2019s roles, increase team communication and functionality, and stimulate the development of shared mental models which facilitate coordination for NIV. We will use positional clarification which involves verbally presenting team members with information about their teammates\u2019 jobs through discussion [28]. Psychological safety and speaking up will be encouraged and facilitated. For example, an RT may assume that physicians have more knowledge about NIV delivery for a particular patient than they do (because physicians are generally more knowledgeable about treatments) and remain quiet; when in fact, the RT has important information about how the patient may respond (cognitive bias) [29].",

We will compare characteristics of hospitals, including staffing characteristics, in the two study arms via chi-square tests and t tests or Wilcoxon tests. Characteristics of patients in the enrolled hospitals in the two arms will be compared via GEE models accounting for clustering by hospital. We will calculate the percentage of patients treated according to each of the primary ventilatory strategies: no assisted ventilation, NIV, and IMV. We will then calculate the proportion of patients initially treated with NIV among those who received assisted ventilation. We will estimate a risk-standardized proportion of ventilated patients initially treated with NIV (RS-NIV) for each hospital and for each data collection period (baseline period, 18 months post-intervention, and between 18 to 36 months post-intervention). We will use hierarchical logistic regression with a random hospital effect to model initial use of NIV among patients started on ventilation, adjusting for demographics, and comorbidities. From the model, a predicted NIV percentage for each hospital will be computed as the NIV percentage that would be anticipated at a particular hospital by using its hospital random effect, given the patient case mix. The expected NIV percentage will be computed as the rate that would be expected if the same patient mix were treated at an \u201caverage\u201d hospital, using the average hospital effect. The RS-NIV percentage is then computed as the ratio of predicted to expected NIV percentage standardized by the overall unadjusted mean NIV percentage for all admissions in our model. Risk standardization has 2 key advantages: it adjusts for differences in patient mix, which may impact the suitability of NIV; it also provides more stabilized estimates based upon Bayesian shrinkage towards the overall mean among hospitals with small numbers of ventilated patients [32, 33]. The mean and median RS-NIV rates of the two arms will be computed for each study period. The primary analysis will use an analysis of variance model to compare IPE to OLE on change in RS-NIV rates from baseline to 18 months post-intervention. Additional analyses will adjust for hospital characteristics that are unbalanced between the study arms. A secondary analysis will compare the post-intervention levels, adjusting for baseline RS-NIV. To assess sustainability, similar models will be used to compare level of RS-NIV after an additional 18 months have passed.",

When organizational readiness is low, clinicians at these hospitals are likely to see the implementation (educational strategies) for the intervention (NIV use in COPD exacerbations) as undesirable and potentially avoid or resist planning for the implementation or participating in the implementation [34, 35]. The ORIC will allow us to identify the difference between organizations resisting the change (increasing NIV utilization) and sites that are unable to implement the educational strategies due to difficulties inherent in organizing and conducting the educational strategies at their hospital.

We then selected the 48 hospitals with RS-NIV proportion less than 55%, based on the clinical impression that these hospitals would have sufficient room for improvement, as potentially eligible sites. Among these hospitals, the median number of eligible COPD patients was 197 over a 12-month period, ranging from 23 to 556 patients. The number of ventilated patients per hospital ranged from 7 to 163, with a median of 37. To achieve stability in estimation of hospital level RS-NIV, we will assess our primary endpoint at 18 months post-intervention expecting a minimum of 10 ventilated patients per hospital in which to assess NIV rates. Power analysis was conducted to determine the number of hospitals needed to assess the primary outcome of difference between the study arms in change in the hospital level risk-standardized proportion of ventilator starts that are NIV (RS-NIV). Using a type I error rate of 0.05, and standard deviation of change in rates over time derived from our prior work with the Premier data base, a total sample of 20 hospitals, 10 in each arm will give 80% power to detect difference of 15% in change (e.g., 5% increase among OLE hospitals, vs. 20% increase among IPE hospitals). Power is > 90% to detect a 20% difference in change between the intervention groups.",

Prior studies showed that it mediates the relationship between employment status, work attitude, and performance [36, 37]. In our previous study, in-depth interviews with key stakeholders from a sample of hospitals with high use of NIV suggested that RT autonomy is critical to achieving timely initiation of NIV, often facilitated by the use of protocols [15]. These results are in line with prior literature [38] that supports the benefits of autonomous RT practice for weaning from IMV [39, 40]. Factors identified by the interviewees to contribute to RT autonomy were RT-driven protocols, RT expertise, and collegial relationship between RT and physicians. We assume that IPE will increase the physicians trust in RTs by allowing them to learn about their abilities and duties and concerns, and that IPE will facilitate team member recognition of their own knowledge with RTs being more likely to \u201cspeak up\u201d (e.g., to suggest NIV use instead of intubation). To assess RT autonomy, we adapted a survey from the 11-item job autonomy measure from Aarons et al [37].",
