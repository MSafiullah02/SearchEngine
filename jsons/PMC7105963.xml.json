Among the positive concordant samples, 81 were monomicrobic (100% concordance) and 28 polymicrobic, with all pathogens involved in coinfection, defined as the presence of \u2265 2 viruses in the same sample, correctly identified by both methods. Of the 19 (13%) discordant samples, 15 (79%) were polymicrobic and in each case concordant for the main pathogens. In these 15 samples, a total of 39 pathogens were found: 21 of these were detected by both systems (Ct < 37) and 18 were detected by only one assay. In particular, in the Siemens workflow, 14 out of 18 of these co-pathogens (5 of which were MPV) were detected with a Ct range of 35-37, while the Seegene workflow detected 4 out of 18 co-pathogens with Ct values between 37 and 40. Of the other four discordant samples, two tested negative by Seegene workflow but positive by Siemens workflow: one was positive for influenza A virus (H1N1-pdm09), and the other for RV, both with low viral load. The latter results were confirmed using a specific real-time PCR assay. Notably, the clinical history of the patients indicated a previous respiratory infection that could explain the presence of residual virus. Finally, 2 out of 19 samples were discordant for the CoV type. Specifically, the Seegene workflow identified CoVOC43, while the Siemens workflow identified CoVHKU1. Sequencing confirmed the presence of the CoVHKU1 subtype. Moreover, the Siemens workflow identified six PeVs, a target not available in the Seegene workflow.",

For these reasons, the Food and Drug Administration has approved several rapid multiplex panels, which show high sensitivity and specificity [18, 19].

High concordance between the two assays was also observed. Discordance between platforms was mainly detected with samples containing multiple pathogens, some of which were present in low amounts. This was primarily associated with the detection of metapneumovirus, as previously reported by other authors [20]. Though the main pathogens were always correctly identified by both assays, the Siemens workflow performed better in detecting low viral loads than the Seegene workflow. However, the low levels of respiratory viruses detected, especially in the presence of pathogens with a low Ct value (high DNA/RNA load), are likely to be related to underlying or residual infection. Thus the clinical meaning of these results is still open to discussion.",
