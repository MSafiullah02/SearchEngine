Other papers found in the literature have proposed more compartments in their models (like exposed, asymptomatic, and many others) [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Here, we decided to keep the model as simple as possible, since adding more compartments increases the number of unknown parameters to be estimated, which in turn hinders the accurate calibration of the model. In addition, to face the fast dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic, the model includes time-dependent coefficients.",

Once estimated, the PDFs of the coefficients, their means, standard deviations (SD), and shape provide important information on model parameters that are essential in the characterization of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the inverse UQ, we observed that different PDFs of the model coefficients were needed to explain the distinct dynamics of the COVID-19 in the three countries.

            "text": "In this work, the mathematical model proposed is a non-linear system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) [28], [29], [30], based on the classic compartmental SIRD model [31], [32], [33]. We decided to keep the model as simple as possible since adding more compartments increases the number of unknown parameters to be estimated, which in turn hinders the accurate calibration of the model. In addition, to face the fast dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the model includes time-dependent coefficients. The model is described by the following equations:(1)dSdt=\u2212\u03b1(t)NSI,\n(2)dIdt=\u03b1(t)NSI+f(t)\u2212\u03b2I\u2212\u03b3I,\n(3)dRdt=\u03b3I,\n(4)dDdt=\u03b2I,\n(5)Ir=\u03b8I(t\u2212(1\u2212\u03b8)\u03c41),where S, I, R, D, and Ir are the variables that represent the number of individuals within a population of size N that are susceptible, infected, recovered, dead, or that are reported as infected, respectively. The term \u03b1(t)N=a(t)b/N denotes the rate at which a susceptible individual becomes infected; where a(t) denotes the probability of contact and b the rate of infection. The function a(t) models the non-pharmaceutical interventions adopted to contain the spread of the virus:(6)a(t)={1,ift<ti,r\u22121\u0394(t\u2212ti)+1,ifti\u2264tandt\u2264ti+\u0394,r,otherwise.This is a simple approach that assumes the intervention for containing the spread of the virus start to be implemented at ti and at the final time ti+\u0394 it reduces the probability of contact by a factor r. The constant \u03b2=m(1/\u03c4o) models the mortality rate of infected individuals, where m is the probability of death. Note that this is different to the rate of death and to the percentage of death among the reported cases of positive infection (Ir). \u03c4o=\u03c41+\u03c42 is the number of days from infection until death, where \u03c4\n1 is the incubation time of the virus and \u03c4\n2 is the time between the first symptoms until death. Similarly, \u03c4r=\u03c41+\u03c43, where \u03c4\n3 is the time between the first symptoms until recovery. The constant \u03b3=(1\u2212m)(1/\u03c4r) is the rate at which infected individuals recover from the virus, where \u03c4r is the number of days from infection until recovery. The function f(t)=eP(t) represents a positive influx of infected individuals coming from other countries, where P(t) is the number of infected individuals in the world, and was modeled as an exponential function of the form P(t)=c0exp(c1t), where c\n0 and c\n1 are coefficients determined from reported data. The parameter e models how the COVID-19 worldwide dynamics affects the country. Small values of e suggest that border controls are effective. Finally, \u03b8 represents the percentage of confirmed infected individuals that are notified or reported. Observe that (1\u2212\u03b8)\u03c41 is used to model the delay between the first day of infection and the notification day for the cases that are reported (Ir).",

In addition, inverse UQ and SA were used for the proper estimation of the coefficients of the models as probability density functions, and their impact on the dynamics of the pandemic, respectively. Other novel features of the model include: 1) A variable that models the reported infected population, Ir=\u03b8I(t\u2212delay), where \u03b8 is the percentage of reported case, and delay models the time from the day of infection to the conclusion of the test for COVID-19; 2) a model for the reduction of contact, isolation, or social distancing; and 3) a parameter that represents the effectiveness of the border control. The proposed model was used to analyze three countries at different stages of the pandemic with different intervention policies. The proposed framework helped the unique characterization of the pandemic in each country. This fine characterization of the dynamics may support authorities in important questions such as decisions on stronger or weaker social isolation, border restriction policies, as well as on the estimation of the real number of infected cases.",

Of notice, all the novel features of the model mentioned above played essential roles in the characterization of the pandemic.",

Korea than to Italy, 3.1%. The notification of infected cases in S. Korea is estimated to be high, around 95%, while in Brazil and Italy, the notifications are very low, around 10% and 23%, respectively. The simulations have confirmed that S. Korea adopted very effective mitigation strategies: the virus transmission dropped to 9% of its initial value. On the other hand, Brazil only reduced their transmission rates to 60% and Italy to 23%. The number of infected people in S. Korea has been declining for almost a month. Therefore, the simulations performed in this study suggest that non-pharmaceutical interventions are decisive in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, and underreporting challenges the management of the pandemic by adding significant uncertainties in the characterization of the COVID-19 dynamics. The results also highlight a delicate situation for Brazil. Our estimation of the product r b, i.e., the transmission rate reduced by the mitigation policies, is 0.15, 0.07, and 0.02 for Brazil, Italy, and S. Korea, respectively. An effective transmission rate that is twice the one observed in Italy and notification of cases as low as 10% may pose additional challenges to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.",
