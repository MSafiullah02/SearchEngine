Fifty percent of patients with ESLD will die within 2 years of their index decompensation, and while liver transplantation is a definitive cure, it is available to a limited number of patients [2]. For example, there were 38,170 reported deaths from ESLD in the USA in 2014, while only 7237 liver transplants were performed for all forms of liver disease [3, 4]. The supportive needs of patients with ESLD are also high. Their symptom burden is comparable to patients with advanced lung and colon cancer in the last 6 months prior to death, and Medicare beneficiaries with cirrhosis also report greater functional disability and use of healthcare utilization compared to age-matched controls and patients with heart failure [5, 6].",

Only 29% of Medicare beneficiaries from 2007 to 2011 with ESLD were referred to hospice within 3 years of an index hospitalization despite the fact that 77% of the same cohort were re-hospitalized and 56% died in the same follow-up period [7]. In a national study examining in-hospital deaths of patients with ESLD from 2009 to 2013, use of invasive life-sustaining treatments was high with 56% percent of patients receiving mechanical ventilation, 16% receiving hemodialysis, and 6% receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, only 30% of patients received palliative care, which was associated with reduced procedure burden, lower costs, and lower lengths of stay [8].",

Nineteen quality indicators (QIs) for palliative care in ESLD were recently selected using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method (RAM) [13]. Our study\u2019s primary aim was to pilot the use of these QIs to measure the quality of palliative care delivered to veterans with ESLD. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Health System is the largest provider of care for patients with hepatitis C, and given the rising incidence of ESLD in this population, optimizing palliative care in this population is particularly crucial [14\u201316]. Our secondary aim is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of three different sampling strategies used in previous research to identify patients with ESLD within the veteran population.",

A patient who was eligible for a QI received a score of 1 if the recommended process measure was received; otherwise, they received a score of 0. Pass rates were calculated by dividing the number of times the QIs were passed over the number of eligible patients for that QI. We abstracted information on patient demographics, homelessness, history of substance abuse, history of viral hepatitis C, history of hepatocellular cancer, documentation pertaining to liver transplant evaluation, and receipt of specialty palliative care services. We also calculated overall quality scores by domain as an average across the domain measures and stratified scores based on variables of interest to explore how different patient characteristics are associated with the quality of palliative care provided. Two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact tests were used to compare the categorization of domain-level quality scores by patient characteristics. Interrater reliability on receipt of quality indicators was determined by calculating the kappa coefficient for each numerator and denominator for a 20% subset of our final sample that were abstracted separately by two abstractors. The confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity are exact binomial confidence intervals constructed using the method of Clopper and Pearson. [19].",

The avoidance of NSAIDs, however, was not followed 39% of the time, which may reflect the tension that providers face when only limited options are present to alleviate pain in patients with ESLD, who are at higher risk of adverse events from available pain relief strategies, such as narcotics [27]. Patients with a history of homelessness and history of drug and alcohol abuse were more likely to receive supportive QIs. This runs counter to previous studies that have shown more challenges in access and provision of palliative care in these patient populations but may reflect the high commitment to providing these services in the veteran Health Administration [28\u201330].",

The findings of this study were performed at a single VA medical center and as such, reported results from a small sample size that cannot be generalized. Certain stratified trends in QI receipt that were not significant using our cohort may be more apparent using a larger cohort of patients. Future work should explore natural language processing and machine learning as potential methods to improve identification of a denominator with higher sensitivity and specificity. The perspectives of veterans with ESLD and caregivers on receipt of palliative care and hospice services should also be collected to help guide future quality improvement work in this field. Our findings demonstrate that it is feasible to measure the quality of palliative care for a veteran cohort of patients with ESLD with good reliability. Our identification of a seriously ill group of patients with ESLD using a combination of ICD-9 codes can be used for future cohort studies in the VA system that are looking to investigate their clinical care and outcomes. Our preliminary findings from this study highlight the need for better information care planning in patients with ESLD, particularly as patients\u2019 care becomes more acute, and suggest some benefit in involving specialty palliative care services in improving this goal. We believe our methods for measuring quality of palliative care can be applied to the national veteran population, which can further add to our knowledge of ways to better improve the care of this vulnerable group.",
