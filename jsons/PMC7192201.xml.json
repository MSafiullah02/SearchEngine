The first Chinese nationwide study by Liang et al. from the Chinese epicenter suggests that cancer patients have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection (1 vs 0.29%) and a higher risk of severe illness and a need for intensive care assistance (39 vs 8%; p = 0.0003) [11]. A history of anticancer treatment or surgery in the past month was associated with poor outcomes (OR = 4.079; 95% CI: 1.086\u201315.322). This susceptibility to severe infections was attributed to the immunosuppressive effect of the primary disease and anticancer treatments [11]. The provision of care promptly faces many difficulties since the exposition to a hospital setting in such times carries an increased risk for infection in these patients. Hospital admission and recurrent hospital visits were found to be a potential risk factor for COVID-19 infection (OR = 4.079; 95% CI: 1.086\u201315.322) [12]. Overall, cancer patients seem at a higher risk of severe events in 48\u201354% of cases and death in 5.6\u201329% [13\u201315].",

These guidelines mainly focused on the necessity to screen patients for possible COVID-19 infection to ensure their admission to the COVID-19 unit rather than the outpatient department or oncology floor, as well as deferring their anticancer treatment till full recovery. Indeed, chemotherapy has an immunosuppressive effect which puts the patients at risk of being infected and immune checkpoint inhibitors increase the risk of cytokine release syndrome if the patients are infected [16]. The LSMO guidelines stressed the necessity to prioritize patients on a case-by-case scenario favoring curative rather than palliative therapy, oral rather than intravenous treatment and recommending therapeutic pause if plausible [17] (Box 1). We have also published in the Future Oncology journal an overview of available evidence concerning COVID-19 in cancer patients to better guide management decisions [18].",

The Hematology-Oncology Department occupies two floors with a total of 50 beds serving around 20% of the Lebanese cancer patients. The medical team includes 9 senior oncologists, 7 senior oncology fellows, 5 interns, and 24 nurses and 16 practical nurses. As a result of the lockdown state imposed by the Lebanese Government, our head of department (coauthor of the LSMO guidelines and senior author [JK] of this manuscript) elected to abide by the LSMO guidelines in line with the majority of the oncology societies [19\u201323]. The application of these measures started at the beginning of March 2020 by contacting patients or family members to clearly explain these new measures. Patients were also screened for the presence of respiratory symptoms before presenting to the hospital. We noted that the patients and their family feared of contracting the COVID-19 infection during the hospital and were reluctant to accept any treatment modification or suspension except for few elderly patients that accepted the switch to oral chemotherapy such as replacing 5-fluorouracil with capecitabine for colon cancer patients and hormonal therapy for castrate resistance prostate cancer patients. The number of hospitalized patients at the 1-day unit during February, March and April 2020 remained comparable to the same period during the last year.",

We encountered several limitations in applying our institutional and LSMO guidelines. Patients were reluctant to accept a therapeutic pause by fear of disease progression, more patientsspecifically patients undergoing palliative treatment refused any type of treatment modification. We have previously reported on this behavior among our cancer patients who often lean toward an oncologic treatment even during the last month of life [24].",

Unfortunately, the healthcare system has been weakened under the pressure of the economic recession, unstable political climate, shortage in nurses and basic help staff. Our experience showed that cancer patients are aware of the COVID-19 morbidity and fear its complications. Nevertheless, we were not able to completely implement the recommendations suggested by the LSMO as well as international societies. Patients were very reluctant to delay or modify their treatment plan although it was medically reasonable. Our approach consisting of screening patients for signs of infections, limiting hospital visits, wearing protective masks by the medical team as well as the patients, postponing surgeries and limiting radiotherapy when possible, protected our patients and our medical team from COVID-19 infection.",
