This is consistent with the literature [1, 34] and our findings. The highest rate of early and overall hospital mortality in the NSI group may be contributed to the fact that these patients might have been too instable or injured to be operated on and thus were more likely to die. This is underlined by the highest RISC II score in this subgroup. Yet, these considerations are not reflected by the mean ISS and percentage of patients with ISS \u2265 25, which is highest in the ESI group. Another explanation for the high mortality in the NSI group might be the existence of ethical statements or patient\u2019s provisions against operations or life prolonging interventions. The higher mortality rate in the ESI group during hospital stay may be contributed to the fact that these patients were injured more seriously (higher mean ISS and rate of ISS \u2265 25) compared to the LSI group.",

While arguments for a delayed surgical strategy are that patients are too sick to undergo early spine stabilization and the subsequent operative trauma will increase complications and worsen the patient\u2019s condition, the possibility of an earlier mobilization, pain relief and ability for adequate positioning the patient in the ICU decreases the risk of complications like ARDS, wound infection, urinary tract infection and the development of pressure sores [17, 36, 37], thus potentially improving the clinical course of patients.",

In comparison to ours, their collective was more heterogeneous with respect to accompanying injuries in the early and delayed intervention groups. Although both treatment groups in the study of Bliemel et al. had an ISS \u2265 16, the delayed surgical stabilization group comprised significantly more severe head, abdominal and extremity trauma patients compared to the early stabilization group (head 27.3% vs. 45.2%, abdominal 15.5 vs. 21.4%, extremity 19.8 vs. 31.2%). Additionally, they found that LSI related to MIP with life threatening injuries arriving with signs of shock, the preclinical need for catecholamines, intubation or a tube thoracostomy. Respectively, severe head injuries were the main reason for a delayed surgical treatment of spine fractures. Consistently, they described that in severely injured patients with predominantly one affected body region a trend towards an ESI prevailed. In line with that finding, the mean ISS in their ESI group was significantly lower compared to their LSI group [1]. That differs from our collective where we present severely injured patients with a mean ISS > 25 in the ESI and LSI group. This is consistent with other studies showing that an ESI is beneficial for MIP with a high ISS and thoracic fractures - both in spinal cord and non cord-injured patients [20, 22, 27, 38, 39].",

This is especially intriguing, since we focused on MIP with at least serious thoracic injuries and one might think that early fracture stabilization in the lumbar region should always benefit the e.g. respiratory function by earlier mobilization or more adequate patient positioning. Yet, in our study, only patients with AISLS = 3 showed significant benefits with ESI whereas AISLS = 4 + 5 did not profit from ESI.

In the earlier study the majority of patients with thoracolumbar fractures underwent solely posterior stabilization, whereas the later study distinguished the surgical modality according to the level of the spinal fracture. Although their patient collective differs from ISS values (mean ISS of the subgroups was 11.4 to 14.6) they provided two interesting findings: 1) posterior instrumentation showed a lower complication rate and 2) the combined procedure had a longer operation time and a higher blood loss during surgery (152 min vs. 298 min, 650 ml vs. 959 ml) which influenced the initial coagulopathy after severe trauma [47, 48].

Patients with injuries to the thoracic spine (AISTS = 3) or lumbar spine (AISLS = 3) significantly benefit from this early surgical intervention concerning ventilation time (AISLS = 3 only), ARDS, multiple organ failure, sepsis rate (AISTS = 3 only), length of stay in the intensive care unit and length of hospital stay. In multiple injured patients with at least severe thoracic spine trauma (AISTS \u2265 4) early surgery showed a significantly shorter ventilation time, decreased sepsis rate as well as shorter time spend in the ICU and in hospital. We suggest primary spine surgery for fracture stabilization in MIP with leading thoracic trauma, especially in patients suffering from fractures of the thoracic spine, within 72 h.",
