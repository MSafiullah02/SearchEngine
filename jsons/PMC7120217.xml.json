Environmental and occupational exposures, systemic diseases, and genetic causes can all result in a variety of interstitial lung diseases. The idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) refer to a group of distinct clinicopathologic entities without known causes [1]. Classification of IIP has undergone several iterations as understanding of these entities evolves [2\u20134]. The most common IIP is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which accounts for approximately 40% of all idiopathic interstitial lung disease [5]. While idiopathic forms do exist, the other IIPs more commonly result from exposures, such as tobacco smoke or connective tissue disease.",

The UIP pattern on HRCT consists of reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion in a patchy subpleural and bibasilar distribution (Fig. 12.1) [11, 12]. These findings may be asymmetric but not unilateral. Honeycombing is a critical component of a confident, radiologic diagnosis of UIP (Figs. 12.2, 12.3). Honeycombing consists of clustered cystic spaces stacked upon a subpleural base. These cystic spaces have well-defined walls and typically range from 3 to 10 mm in size but may extend up to 2.5 cm in diameter [1, 5, 13]. Centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema may coexist with CT findings of UIP and should not be mistaken for honeycombing (Fig. 12.4) [8, 14\u201318]. Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy is also common, typically involving the right paratracheal and subcarinal stations. The degree of lymphadenopathy typically correlates with the extent of parenchymal reticulation, although short axis lymph node measurements rarely exceed 1.5\u20132.0 cm in the absence of another superimposed cause [19, 20]. Ground-glass opacities can be associated with areas of fibrosis and may even represent regions of fibrosis. However, ground-glass opacities should account for a relatively minor component of parenchymal abnormality.\n\n\n\n",

However, these studies also show that a confidant diagnosis is not made in 25\u201350% of histologically proven cases of UIP [21\u201327]. Silva et al. demonstrated that the findings of basal honeycombing, the absence of subpleural sparing, and the absence of centrilobular nodules best distinguish UIP from chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) [28]. CT findings that should suggest alternative etiologies include micronodules; air trapping; non-honeycomb cysts; consolidation; a peribronchovascular distribution of fibrosis, and significant pleural calcifications, plaques, or effusion [5].",

Opportunistic organisms in this setting include Mycobacteria, Pneumocystis jiroveci, and Aspergillus species [32, 33]. Acute exacerbation occurs in approximately 5\u201310% of patients on an annual basis. Associated CT findings include new ground-glass opacities and consolidation in a peripheral, diffuse, or multifocal random distribution (Fig. 12.8). It is unclear whether these acute exacerbations represent rapid advancement of the primary disease or superimposed infection, infarction, or other pathology difficult to separate from the primary process [34\u201339]. Pulmonary hypertension is commonly associated with IPF, although CT-derived vascular measurements may be of limited predictive value [40]. Bronchogenic carcinoma (Fig. 12.9) develops in approximately 10\u201315% of those with relatively longstanding IPF and usually manifests as new focal consolidation or nodule in a region of severe fibrosis [41].

The severity and distribution of these parenchymal abnormalities are more uniform than in UIP. Distribution along the axial plane may be peripheral, peribronchovascular, or diffuse. When present and in the appropriate setting, a thin rim of subpleural sparing is a rather specific finding for NSIP and should heighten diagnostic confidence (Fig. 12.9) [43]. As with IPF, mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy is common, particularly at the right paratracheal and subcarinal stations, and correlates with the degree of parenchymal involvement. Given the high association of NSIP with underlying collagen vascular diseases and other disorders, associated abnormalities may be sought on available imaging studies.",

Foci of consolidation may be migratory on serial imaging. Common associated findings include ground-glass opacities in a random distribution (60%) (Fig. 12.12), air bronchograms (Fig. 12.13), and mild bronchial dilation. Lung volumes are typically preserved, and architectural distortion is generally absent. Small pleural effusions may occur in a small minority of patients. The reverse-halo sign (Fig. 12.14) was first described in the setting of OP as a relatively specific finding. This sign refers to a central region of ground-glass opacity surrounded by a > 2 mm crescent or ring of denser consolidation. Kim et al. reported the reverse-halo sign in 19% of biopsy proven cases of OP [62]. However, a reverse halo sign has since been reported in numerous separate entities [62]. Reticulation and honeycombing are uncommon to rare but when present are associated with an increased risk of progressive disease [63\u201365].\n\n\n\n",

With RB, pigmented macrophages are limited primarily to the respiratory bronchioles whereas macrophage accumulation is more extensive with RB-ILD and diffuse in DIP. By definition, patients with RB are asymptomatic while those with RB-ILD and DIP may present with dyspnea, cough, and abnormal pulmonary function tests [68].",
