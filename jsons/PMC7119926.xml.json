            "text": "There has been a significant increase of global preschool asthma prevalence since the early twentieth century, paralleled with reported increases in the prevalence of allergies. This increase may have leveled off in some areas, while in others the rise seems to continue [1]. Specifically, the prevalence of asthma seems to have reached a plateau in high-income countries, whereas in low- and middle-income countries, the prevalence is ever increasing. Factors affecting this increase in prevalence in preschool children have been actively studied but are yet to be fully understood, as both genetics and environmental exposures affect several aspects of disease risk and severity. There is a male predominance in prevalence of asthma and wheezing disorders before puberty and a \u201csex-shift\u201d toward females after puberty [2]. Relating to environmental exposures, it has been hypothesized that the transition to a more urban environment may have driven the development of asthma in general and wheezing disorders in preschool children [3, 4]. Whether the prevalence of severe asthma in preschool children has changed in the last decades is largely unknown.",

Approximately 40% of preschoolers who wheeze show respiratory symptoms later in their childhood, although there is variation from 22% to 55% [7\u20139]. Despite the high incidence and prevalence, there are knowledge gaps regarding the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and the optimal treatment of wheezing disorders in preschool children. There is substantial heterogeneity in the spectrum of symptom development, duration, frequency, severity, and response to treatment, as well as the pathophysiology and risk factors behind preschool wheezing [10]. This hinders general preventive efforts and may also result in inadequate treatment. A special consideration with preschool wheezing compared to that of later age-groups is that wheezing is predominantly triggered by viral infections, whereas later in childhood reasons such as allergens or exercise dominate. Approximately one half of all preschoolers wheeze at some point in time, and one third of this group will have asthma later in their life [11]. Fortunately, most infants with wheezing disorders have a good prognosis and remain free from subsequent wheezing episodes later in life.",

Asthma and severe wheezing are common conditions in emergency departments at children\u2019s hospitals. In addition to wheezing, children typically present with symptoms such as tachycardia, tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, and reduced blood saturation of oxygen. Older children may use their accessory muscles to aid their breathing, whereas in younger children chest wall recession (severe retractions) is observed. Older children with an acute asthma attack often have a history with asthma causing their symptoms; however, children in preschool age do not necessarily have known asthma or bronchospasm as the cardinal reasons behind their wheezing. In addition, lower respiratory tract infections or foreign body aspiration may manifest with similar symptoms. Details of the differential diagnoses of wheezing disorders are discussed in other chapters. In epidemiology studies, the prevalence of wheezing is often derived from questionnaires answered by parents using questions like \u201cHas your child had wheezing or whistling in the chest in the last 12 months?\u201d [12].",

In general, asthma is diagnosed based on presence of, or history of, symptoms like wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and trouble breathing. In addition, information on symptom triggers, effect of asthma medications, family history, and atopic status may be used as basis for the diagnosis. It is important to keep in mind that many large epidemiological studies use questionnaire-based parental report of asthma symptoms or outcomes in order to define disease status and severity. Parental report may be subject to over- or underreporting, and even validated questionnaires are not fully free of the risk of bias. In older children objective tools such as spirometry, bronchodilator response, and methacholine challenges may be helpful; however, in the preschool years, such tools are difficult to administer.",

The most common causative viral pathogens include human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus [13]. In addition, bacterial infections are shown to be associated independently of possible concurrent viral infections with wheezing episodes. Preschool children with or without wheezing have the same type of pathogens (bacteria or viruses), and hence the type of pathogen likely is not determinant for the wheezing but rather the presence of pathogens [14]. The long-term outcomes vary: wheezing may disappear, continue into school age, or develop into multiple-trigger wheezing and later manifest asthma. The prevalence of episodic wheezing decreases with age [15].",

The condition shows less seasonal variance compared to episodic wheezing mostly linked to viral infections, and its absolute prevalence throughout childhood remains rather constant, though its proportion compared to episodic wheezing increases with age. Children with multiple-trigger wheeze have a higher risk of later asthma compared to children with episodic wheeze [16].

            "text": " Parental or sibling history of asthma remains one of the most well-established risk factors for wheezing and asthma in children, further supported by high estimates for asthma heritability in twin studies. In 2007, the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of childhood asthma was published, and genetic variants regulating ORMDL3 expression on chromosome 17q21 were identified as strong determinants of asthma susceptibility [21]. Since then, this gene region has been replicated for asthma and wheeze in numerous studies worldwide, and analyses stratified by age of onset suggest that ORMDL3 variants are particularly associated with early childhood-onset asthma (below the age of 4 in this study) [22]. The ORMDL genes encode transmembrane proteins that are anchored into the endoplasmic reticulum and are believed to be involved in protein folding and cellular functions such as responses to inflammation and dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism. As a possible mechanism linking early virus infections to childhood, asthma is supported by findings that variants at the 17q21 asthma locus (including ORMDL3) have been specifically associated with asthma in children who had had HRV wheezing illnesses early in life, connecting genetic susceptibility, HRV infection, and asthma development [4]. Additional evidence linking viral infections to asthma genetics relates to the gene encoding for the HRV receptor (C), CDHR3 on chromosome 7q22. was first identified in a GWAS on severe preschool asthma exacerbations in children [23], and only later did experimental work lead to the identification of CDHR3 as the virus receptor [24]. Severe bronchiolitis, most often induced by viral infections, has also been evaluated using the GWAS approach. Interestingly, KCND3, which encodes a potassium voltage-gated channel, was recently identified in a GWAS of children hospitalized for bronchiolitis. KCND3 had previously been associated with occupational asthma. Most other works on the genetics of severe preschool asthma or wheeze (and bronchiolitis) have focused on candidate genes, such as IL4 [25].",

Epigenetic changes may persist over a number of cell generations and can potentially be transmitted from parents to offspring. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate where and when different genes are active. DNA methylation is one of the regulatory mechanisms, and recent studies have found that genetics, aging, and environmental factors can influence the level of methylation globally or in specific genes, and early-life factors have been particularly studied. There are very strong associations between maternal smoking during pregnancy and DNA methylation changes at birth, as well as later during childhood [27]. Studies on 4- and 8-year-old children show that asthmatics have a lower degree of DNA methylation in certain immune cells than healthy controls, particularly in the eosinophils, which play a critical role in the asthmatic inflammation [28]. However, no association was seen between methylation in identified genes in cord blood and later asthma, which suggests that these particular changes were acquired during early childhood. Interestingly, the identified methylation marks were associated with transcriptomics patterns that suggest reduced activity of naive T cells and increased activity of effector and memory CD8 T cells and natural killer cells. This methylation-expression pattern in children with asthma may be due to different environmental factors such as air pollution, tobacco smoke exposure, or viral/bacterial infections, although definite mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In other methylation studies on children with asthma, association with several known immune/asthma genes, including IL13 and RUNX3, has been described [29]. Associations between methylation status in newborns and later asthma at school age have also been reported [30].",

Occurrence can be measured either as a positive serum-specific IgE (sIgE) test or a positive skin prick test. Atopy encompasses several endotypes and manifests with many different phenotypes [31]. A phenotype encompasses observable traits or characteristics of a condition (e.g., allergic dermatitis or sensitization in allergic versus non-allergic asthma), whereas an endotype refers to an etiological (physiological or pathological) mechanism behind a disease. Persistent childhood wheezing is associated with atopy, and in turn, atopy is one of the strongest risk factors for later asthma and is related to an increased severity of asthma [32]. Atopic children, especially those with multiple sensitization, with asthma tend to be at higher treatment steps and have decreased lung function and more severe asthma in general [33]. In infants, sensitization to egg and milk typically occurs first, later to be followed by sensitization to other foods and airborne allergens. Depending on the geographical region and allergen load, different allergens are associated with asthma and multi-trigger (persistent) wheezing (e.g., mites, cockroaches, grass, or tree pollens) in different countries. Although atopic sensitization may be more commonly associated with multiple-trigger wheezing, it may also be associated with viral wheezing, since the clinical phenotype based on symptom pattern does not incorporate atopic status.",

Results from longitudinal cohort studies suggest that the wheezing phenotypes most strongly associated with atopy (and airway responsiveness) are characterized by onset after age 18 months [34]. Also, a high blood eosinophil count may be a sign of an increased risk of persistent wheezing and atopy [35]. As such, early eosinophilia, allergic sensitization, and elevated total IgE levels indicate immune responses associated with persistent wheezing, asthma development, and asthma severity [36, 37]. Both skin prick tests and sIgE analyses have their pros and cons. Although the results between skin prick tests and sIgE are not always concordant, they may complement each other and, in general, serve as reliable markers of atopy and specific allergy. The effect of other aspects of sensitization in the prediction and prevention of wheezing and asthma, e.g., allergen exposure or avoidance, is discussed further down in the text.",

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in infancy (e.g., wheezing in conjunction with laughing, crying, or exposures such as cold air and tobacco smoke exposure) has been linked with a decreased lung function in children between the ages of 5 and 9 [41] and is also a risk factor for the development of asthma .",

Respiratory illness caused by HRV before the age of 3 has also been linked to an increased risk of developing asthma [50]. These patients often have an atopic predisposition and seem to respond to anti-inflammatory asthma treatment [51]. In older children with diagnosed asthma, HRV infections may give more severe symptoms and a longer duration of the illness as well as a greater impairment of lung function. This may partly be due to a malfunction in the aborting of virus replication in asthmatic children [52].",

Host factors affect the risk of being infected with HRV, and recent studies have indicated that genetic susceptibility may play an important role both indirectly and directly. CDHR3, a member of the cadherin family, was shown to be downregulated in preschool-aged patients with HRV-induced wheezing [55]. Children of mothers with atopic asthma have an increased risk of HRV bronchiolitis, and variants in known asthma genes have also been reported to modify asthma risk following HRV infection (see section \u201cGenetics\u201d above).",

Tobacco smoke contains numerous harmful chemicals and toxins that may cause damage to developing lungs pre- or postnatally. Maternal smoking has been associated with deficient lung growth and wheezing, thus establishing a link between in utero exposure to tobacco smoke and a later phenotype of wheezing [56]. Secondhand tobacco smoke exposure early in life has been associated with reduced lung function in preschoolers, development of wheezing and asthma, a higher susceptibility to airway infections, and more severe manifestations of respiratory tract illnesses. Exposure to tobacco smoke is harmful due to both its inducing and exacerbating effect and is shown to be linked with more severe wheezing disorders in preschoolers [57]. Children exposed to tobacco smoke before birth and in infancy are also more susceptible to wheezing when exposed to other risk factors like traffic-related air pollutants; thus it seems that smoking may lead to damage and increased vulnerability in preschoolers\u2019 lungs [58].",

            "text": "Air pollution (outdoor and indoor) is a global problem and one of the most important environmental determinants for human health. According to recent estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 90% of children worldwide breathe toxic air. Ambient air pollution consists of organic and inorganic liquid and solid particles suspended in air (particulate matter \u2013 PM), as well as different gases such as ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO), and vapors such as volatile organic carbons (VOCs). The primary sources of ambient air pollutants are fuel combustion from motor vehicles, heat and power generation, industry and agriculture, as well as residential cooking and heating. In addition, natural sources (e.g., dust) also contribute significantly. Air pollutants may induce airway inflammation, increased airway responsiveness, and lung damage, and this is partly due to generation of free radicals and oxidative stress. Studies investigating exhaled nitric oxide support that inflammatory processes may partially account for the observed effects of air pollution exposure on childhood wheezing and asthma. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is an established biomarker of eosinophilic airway inflammation, and several studies show a relation between exposure and increased FeNO levels [67]. Other studies suggest a mixed inflammation response following exposure, including a predominant neutrophil airway inflammation. It is likely that the air pollutant source (traffic, combustion processes, biomass burning, etc.) in combination with host factors (genetics, preexisting conditions, co-exposures, etc.) will influence the type of individual response. Dietary intake has been suggested to modify the negative health effect of exposure. As an example, higher omega-3 intake was recently associated with diminished harmful effect of particle exposure on symptoms and asthma severity in children age 5\u201312 years, while higher omega-6 intake was associated with an amplified effect [68].",

In studies from the Swedish BAMSE (Barn/Children Allergy Milieu Stockholm Epidemiology) cohort, conducted in the Stockholm area with air pollution exposure levels well below the current WHO guidelines, exposure during the first year of life seemed to have the largest impact on school age lung function [69]. There is now robust evidence that air pollution exposure is linked to recurrent wheezing in young children, and recent studies also suggest increased risk of acute lower respiratory infection below the age of 2 [70, 71]. Further, early-life exposure is associated with increased risk of asthma and wheezing throughout childhood [72, 73].",

In children born at a very low gestational age, i.e., very or extremely prematurely (below 32 or 28 weeks, respectively), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a major health challenge [75]. There is compelling evidence that preterm birth, in particular very or extreme preterm birth, increases the risk (1.7\u20133-fold) of wheezing disorders and asthma [76] (Fig. 2.2). Dose-response effects (i.e., the more preterm, the higher risk of wheeze or asthma) support the notion that immature lungs and airways are vulnerable to early-life exposures, including respiratory tract infections, which may trigger symptoms. Although children with BPD are often regarded as having asthma and are frequently treated with asthma medications, the mechanisms underlying BPD are considered different from asthma and typically do not involve eosinophilic inflammation. Instead, the lungs and airways in children with BPD are characterized by immature lung tissue affected by reparative processes, impaired alveolarization, and dysmorphic vascular growth [77]. In agreement with these findings, the evidence supporting beneficial effects from asthma drugs in preterm BPD subjects is scarce. An increasing body of studies suggests that even moderately preterm birth (gestational age 32\u201336 weeks) is associated with later adverse health outcomes, such as wheezing, asthma-like symptoms, and lung function impairment [78].",

Studies have shown allergen exposure may increase or decrease the risk of disease or, in some cases, have no effect at all, i.e., no relationship observed between allergen exposure early in life and concurrent or later allergies [79]. Sensitization (and subsequent allergen exposure) should, however, be viewed as a prognostic marker, since early wheezing disorders combined with current allergy are an important risk factor for asthma later in life [80].",

In addition, singling out cockroach, mouse, and cat allergen exposure, these three allergens were shown to have an inverse relationship with later wheezing [81]. The relationship of cat or dog allergen exposure early in life and later wheezing and sensitization has been evaluated in numerous studies, often with mixed results (Fig. 2.3). Pooled analysis of data from 11 prospective European birth cohorts that recruited a total of over 22,000 children showed no association between keeping furry pets early in life and asthma in school age, and the study conclusion was that \u201cAdvice from health care practitioners to avoid or to specifically acquire pets for primary prevention of asthma or allergic rhinitis in children should not be given\u201d [82]. In cases where hereditary factors are involved (e.g., maternal atopy or presence of a genetic variant), exposure to allergens may be associated with a different risk [83], but due to challenges with residual confounding and the difficulties to draw firm conclusions about lifestyle factors and disease risk in observational studies, no clear picture has emerged in the literature.",

However, this association is debated, as several studies have not observed a link between vitamin D levels and airway function, both regarding maternal intake and the child\u2019s intake of vitamin D [90, 91]. Meta-analysis results from two randomized controlled trials with a follow-up time of 3 years showed that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy resulted in a significantly reduced risk of asthma or recurrent wheeze in the offspring (~25% risk reduction by 3 years), especially among women with low vitamin D (25(OH)D level <30 ng/ml) at randomization [88].",

Despite clear epidemiological data, the causal exposures (including microbes) and mechanisms related to asthma remain unclear.

A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that maternal obesity is a significant risk factor for the development of childhood asthma or wheeze [96]. Subsequent studies have been able to confirm these associations; however, overweight in the offspring may have a mediating role [97]. Thus, prevention strategies of maternal prepregnancy and childhood obesity might be important to reduce the prevalence of childhood asthma.

This theory noted that the observed increase in the incidence of allergic diseases was paralleled with a general increase in hygiene characterized by a modern lifestyle with smaller families and fewer children, an increase in antibiotic use, and the introduction of vaccination programs. Further to this hypothesis, it has been noted that children who live on traditional cattle farms and encounter more bacteria have less asthma and allergies [103, 104]. Comparing the effect of traditional versus industrialized styles of farming (or Amish and Hutterite farming), the greatest differences are detected in traditional farming environments such as in Amish communities where exposure to animals and ingestion of raw cow milk create a protective effect, emphasizing the importance of the type of farming [105]. In addition to the type of farming, the positioning may make a difference. Clustering farms may mimic this protective microbial diversity when compared to more scattered localizations even if the farms are of the more industrialized type [106]. The largest protective effect is seen if the child is exposed to a farming environment before birth and then continually throughout their childhood [103]. An immune system that is not frequently stimulated by pathogens will, according to the hygiene hypothesis, react to stimuli that are potentially harmless. As such, an unbalanced response, in the absence of microbes, predisposes to allergy, wheezing, and asthma. It should, however, be noted that good personal hygiene or home cleanliness is not linked to an increased risk of allergy nor asthma [107] and there is no association between vaccinations and later allergy or asthma [108].",

Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Moraxella, and Corynebacterium species have been isolated in the lung microbiota of children [111]. One study reported that children with asthma have more Proteobacteria in their airways than healthy controls [110]. The microbiota develops during the first years of life, and it has been shown that abnormal colonization is linked to respiratory diseases later in life \u2013 especially colonization of the lower respiratory tract with Streptococcus during the first year of life is a risk factor for asthma [112, 113]. Newborns and 1-year-olds with lower airway colonization with Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae individually or in combination had an increased risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma at 5 years [114].",

A decreased microbial diversity in the gut in 1-week and 1-month-old infants is associated with asthma at 7 years [118]. Gastrointestinal bacterial infections and more general gut dysbiosis early in life may be associated with later asthma and atopy [119, 120, 121].

Other models have utilized, for example, atopy, heredity, parental education, history of wheezing, sensitization, current eczema, and rhino-conjunctivitis as well as in vitro cytokine production, although all studies show that the negative predictive power was more prominent due to the lower positive predictive values [135, 136]. The most prominent factor repeating in several models is allergen sensitization. Sensitization at preschool age may predict asthma in general at school age: allergy to cat, dog, mold, or pollen (Fig. 2.4) was highly predictive of later asthma at preschool age both in a secondary healthcare and research setting [8]. IgE measurement can be used as a way of differentiating between high- and lower-risk patients (86% vs 45% risk of asthma development when measuring airborne allergen sensitization) as well as in choosing possible therapeutic measures [9]. Predictors may, however, change according to wheezing phenotype or debut age, reflecting the natural variance of wheezing [8, 137].",

The noninvasive model included ten predictors (wheeze frequency, activity disturbance, and parental history of asthma/bronchitis to name a few) and showed promising results with sensitivity and specificity around 70%, PPV 49%, and NPV 86% [138]. Replication in the German MAS cohort supported the applicability of the score [139]. A study by Devulapalli et al. identified that assessing relatively straightforward markers such as the frequency, severity, and number of hospitalizations due to wheezing at the age of 2 predicts later asthma [140].",

FeNO improved the prediction of asthma later in life; a study introducing a novel API with FeNO showed that preschool children with higher FeNO values had a higher risk for asthma at school age [142, 143]. The advantages of FeNO include that it is a noninvasive measuring technique; its disadvantages include that single-breath technique is mostly unachievable for preschoolers and alternative measuring techniques need to be used [144]. One alternative is that of measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath. In one paper, 17 VOCs that differed between asthmatic and transient wheezing preschoolers were identified and that information of VOCs in predictive scores or API improved the prediction of later asthma in a preschool-age population [145, 146].",

Although longitudinal cohorts show that children with virus-induced wheezing symptoms during the first years of life often outgrow their symptoms later in childhood (i.e., transient wheezing), as a group, they do not completely overcome their lung function impairment [149, 150]. These associations suggest that early wheezing may not be such a harmless condition after all. In addition, if a child develops recurrent wheeze or asthma following lower respiratory tract infection in infancy, he or she may be at increased risk for a further deterioration of lung function (the two-hit hypothesis) or develop an increased susceptibility to experience respiratory problems following later environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke. Whether these early and later lung function insults are related to independent risk factors and pathways or instead share a genetically determined susceptibility remains to be elucidated.",
