Consequently, the magnitude and the quality of 68 primary effector CD8 + T cell response often is compromised in aged hosts following pathogen 69 challenge [5] . Likewise, the development of CD8 + memory T cell responses in the circulation 70 and/or in the lymphoid organs is often impaired during aging [6, 7] . This age-related CD8 + T cell 71 attrition in memory T cell differentiation and/or function has been linked to impaired host 72 responses to pathogens following primary infection or vaccination in aged hosts [8] . 73 74 Tissue-resident memory CD8 + T cells (TRM) with potent effector potential are mainly located in 75 peripheral tissue at portals of pathogen entry, whereas circulating central and effector memory T 76 cells survey lymphoid organs and/or peripheral tissues [9, 10] . It has been shown that CD8 + TRM 77 cells can provide nearly sterilizing protection if present in sufficient numbers [11] . Therefore, 78 great enthusiasm has recently centered on enhancing local CD8 + TRM responses as a promising 79 vaccination strategy to control mucosal infections including influenza virus infection [12] . Much 80 progress has been made recently regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating 81 TRM cell development and maintenance [13, 14] . However, relatively less is known regarding the 82 effects of aging in the development and/or function of TRM responses in the mucosal tissues 83 following primary infection. Of note, analysis of spatial and temporal maps of T cell 84 compartmentalization revealed that aged lungs harbor increased levels of CD8 + CD69 + TRM-like 85 cells compared to young lungs [1] . However, it is unclear whether this is caused by a gradual 86 young ( Figure 4B ), while equivalent numbers of lung circulating or splenic memory were observed between young and aged mice (Figure 4C & D) . Together, these data indicated 291 that the aged microenvironment facilitates lung TRM cell accumulation following influenza virus 292 infection even though the responding cells were from the same young donor. 293",

Since aged lungs 311 accumulated significant more CD8 + TRM cells, it is plausible that aged mice may exhibit 312 enhanced protective heterologous immunity against viral reinfection. To this end, we employed a 313 heterologous infection and challenge model in which we infected young or aged mice with PR8 314 virus and then re-challenge the mice with a lethal dose of X31 virus in the presence of FTY720, 315 which blocks the contribution of protective circulating memory T cells [12] . PR8 and X31 316 viruses differ in viral surface proteins, but share internal viral proteins such as NP, which are 317 cross-recognized by memory CD8 + T cells [44, 45] . We confirmed that FTY720 treatment 318 abolished T cell migration ( Figure S4A ). We then followed host morbidity and mortality daily 319 following X31 challenge. All na\u00efve young or aged mice succumbed to lethal X31 infection 320 ( Figure S4B ), while PR8-infected young mice were fully protected from lethal X31 infection in 321 the presence of FTY720 ( Figure 5A ). Strikingly, ~75% of PR8-infected aged animals succumbed 322 to secondary X31 re-challenge, which was almost comparable to mortality of primary X31 323 infection in those mice ( Figure 5A and S4B). Thus, the enhanced presence of CD8 + TRM cells in 324 aged lungs failed to provide heterologous protection against influenza reinfection. 325 326 Among influenza-specific CD8 + T cells, D b -NP-specific T cells appear to be particularly critical 327 for the protection against secondary heterologous viruses [46] . To examine the mechanisms 328 underlying the impaired protective function of TRM cells in aged lungs, we sorted polyclonal D b -329 NP-specific TRM from infected young or aged lungs, and performed scRNAseq at 60 d.p.i. 330 ( Figure S4C ). Compared to D b -NP TRM cells from aged mice, D b -NP TRM from the young mice 331 were enriched in genesets associated with NF-kB signaling and inflammatory immune responses 332 ( Figure 5B ). Furthermore, D b -NP TRM from aged mice had decreased expression of effector 333 molecules such as Ifng and Tnf, and molecules involved with TCR signaling such as Lck and 334",

Cluster 0 cells 338 were mainly comprised of TRM cells from young mice, and clusters 2 and 3 cells consisted mainly of TRM cells from aged mice, while cluster 1 cells were equally divided by TRM cells from 340 young and aged mice ( Figure 5D & E).

Of note, splenic CD8 + memory T 355 cells were also impaired in producing both IFN-g and TNF following peptide re-stimulation 356 during aging ( Figure S5A ), suggesting that the impaired production of functional effector 357 molecules following peptide re-stimulation was not restricted to TRM cells. In contrast to their 358 diminished cytokine production following peptide stimulation (TCR signaling), total CD8 + or 359 D b -NP-specific TRM cells were capable of producing IFN-g and TNF following PMA/Ionomycin 360 restimulation ( Figure S5B , C). These data suggest that D b -NP TRM cells exhibit impaired 361 production of effector molecules specifically following TCR stimulation. Interestingly, following 362 ex vivo stimulation of D b -PA specific TRM cells by PA 224-233 peptide, we found that D b -PA 363 TRM cells from aged and young hosts had similar ability to produce IFN-g and TNF (Figure  364 S5D). These data suggest that the impaired production of effector molecules by D b -NP-specific 365 TRM cells is likely not due to the aged environment, but their developmental defects as 366 demonstrated before [28] . Consistent with this idea, young OT-I cells transferred into the aged 367 hosts did not exhibit functional defects in cytokine production compared to OT-I cells transferred 368 into young mice ( Figure S5 Figure 6A ). Both low dose and high dose CD8 Ab 381 treatment largely ablated splenic CD8 + T cells, however, only high dose CD8 Ab injection 382 caused significant ablation of CD8 + T cells in the lung parenchyma ( Figure 6B and S6A). 383",

            "text": "Neither high nor low dose of CD8 Ab treatment caused significant reduction of CD4 + T or B cell 384 compartments in the lungs (Figure S6 B) . Lung histopathological analysis revealed marked 385 reduction of inflammatory lesions following high dose, but not low dose of CD8 Ab treatment 386 particularly in aged mice following infection ( Figure 6 C-E), indicating that lung resident CD8 + 387 T cells drive chronic lung pathology at the memory phase. Consistent with the histology data, 388 high dose, but not low dose, of CD8 Ab treatment caused significant reduction of Ly6C + 389 monocyte and neutrophil infiltration in aged, but not young lung tissues ( Figure 6F ). Thus, 390 resident CD8 + T cells are responsible for the constant recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils 391 to the tissue at the memory phase. To further explore the roles of resident CD8 T cells in 392 promoting tissue inflammation at the memory stage, we measured immune-associated genes in 393 the lungs by Nanostring. There was a marked decrease in the expression of multiple cytokines 394 and particular chemokines in the lungs of mice that received high CD8 Ab treatment, compared 395 to those of lungs of mice received control Ab or low dose of CD8 Ab at 60 d. [24]. We therefore examined whether CD8 + T cell depletion at 3 weeks post infection could 401 affect lung fibrosis at the memory stage. CD8 + T cell depletion did not affect lung collagen 402 content in infected young mice revealed by both Mason's trichrome staining and hydroxyproline 403 assay ( Figure 6H and I), which measures total collagen protein [49] . These data suggest that 404 normal CD8 + TRM cell responses in young mice contribute minimally to lung fibrotic responses 405 following acute influenza virus infection, which is in contrast to the excessive CD8 + TRM cell-406 induced fibrotic sequelae following PD-L1 blockade [41] . In contrast to young mice, aged mice 407 exhibited increased lung collagen deposition, particularly in the lung parenchyma ( Figure 6H & 408 J). Strikingly, mice received high CD8 Ab treatment had markedly reduced lung fibrosis as 409 revealed by Trichome staining and hydroxyproline assay, compared to lungs of mice that 410 received control Ab or low dose of CD8 Ab ( Figure 6J & K). These data suggest that resident but 411 not circulating CD8 + T cells are important in promoting chronic lung collagen deposition 412 following the resolution of primary influenza infection. In summary, our data indicate that 413 excessive accumulation of lung resident CD8 + T cells does not lead to enhanced protective 414 immunity in aged mice, but rather drive age-associated persistent lung inflammation and chronic 415 fibrosis following viral pneumonia. In this report, we demonstrate that acute influenza infection leads to persistent chronic 434 pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which are largely propagated by an exaggerated CD8 + TRM 435 response in aged hosts. Somewhat counterintuitively, elevated CD8 + TRM cells in the aged lung, 436 fail to provide the protective heterologous immunity to that observed in young mice, likely due 437 to a selective dysfunction in a protective CD8 + TRM cell population (i.e. D b -NP CD8 T cells) [50, 438 51] . Notably, despite a numeric increase in TRM cells, protective heterologous immunity is impaired 450 in aged hosts due to a qualitative defect in TRM cells not present in young mice. The protective 451 function of TRM cells is usually associated with their effector activities at the site of pathogen re-452 entry [56] . For instance, it has been shown that IFN-g is important for TRM cell protective 453 immunity against secondary heterologous influenza virus infection [43] . Consistent with the 454 notion, scRNAseq analysis found that TRM cells against a major protective CD8 + T cell epitope 455 (D b -NP) from aged mice lose a functional TRM subset observed in young hosts; this subset was 456 characterized with robust expression of molecules associated with TCR signaling and effector 457 molecules. As a result, D b -NP specific TRM cells are less sensitive to TCR stimulation for the 458 simultaneous production of IFN-g and TNF. Thus, defective TCR-mediated effector cytokine 459 production could underlie the impaired protection against secondary influenza virus infection. 460",

To our surprise, we observed enhanced TRM cell accumulation, despite diminished lung 443 effector T cell responses and lower levels of splenic memory T cells observed in aged hosts. Our 444 data further indicate that aged environment, likely through elevated tissue TGF-b, promotes TRM 445 cell generation and/or maintenance in a T cell-extrinsic fashion during aging. Of note, aging has 446 been linked to altered na\u00efve T cell repetoires and enhanced representation of senescent virtual 447 memory T cells [54]. Whether these T cell intrinsic changes in aged hosts, in addition to 448 environmental factors, contribute to an enhanced TRM generation, requires further investigation. 449",

            "text": "narrowed TCR-b repertoire in D b -NP CD8 + T cells or their recruitment into a response[6, 28,  471   32]. Thus, intrinsic developmental defects are likely the cause of the functional decline in D b -NP 472 TRM cells[28]. Notably, our data highlight the importance of D b -NP TRM cells in protective 473 immunity as functional impairment specifically in D b -NP cells could translate into differences in 474 the secondary protective immunity. This notion is consistent with previous reports, which have 475 pinpointed robust expansion of D b -NP memory T cells over D b -PA memory T cells in the 476 secondary expansion to provide enhanced protective immunity following heterologous TRM cells exhibit higher levels of expression of multiple effector molecules compared to 480 central and effector memory T cells[13, 60]. The heightened expression of these molecules 481 confers CD8 + TRM cells with superb antiviral function, but may potentially cause bystander tissue 482 inflammation and injury[41]. In experimental models, both CD4 + and CD8 + TRM cells have been 483 implicated in causing tissue immunopathology ranging from persistent allergic inflammation to 484 inflammatory bowel disease[61, 62]. Previous reports have demonstrated that influenza 485 infection in young mice leads to chronic inflammation and collagen deposition[24]. Notably, 486 resident CD8 + T cell depletion only moderately affected pulmonary inflammation and lung 487 collagen deposition in young mice, even though exaggerated CD8 + TRM responses following PD-488 1 blockade can lead to inflammatory and fibrotic sequelae[41]. These data suggest that 489 influenza-infected young lungs are able to tolerate \"normal levels\" of TRM cells, likely due to the490 expression of various inhibitory molecules expressed by TRM cells [41]. During aging, however, 491 influenza virus infection leads to excessive accumulation of TRM cells, which exceeds the ability 492 of the aged tissue to \"counterbalance\" the pathogenic activities of TRM cells, driving enhanced 493 pulmonary inflammation and parenchymal fibrosis. The cellular and molecular mechanisms 494 underlying TRM-mediated lung pathology and fibrosis during aging are unclear currently. 495 However, aging is associated with the impaired capability of tissue repair [27]. It is possible that 496 epithelial injury caused by persistent low level release of cytopathic molecules by TRM cells 497 surpasses the limited recovery capability of the aged tissue. To this end, even though D b -NP TRM 498 cells have diminished TCR signaling for IFN-g and TNF production, their responses to PMA and 499 Ionomycin are intact. Therefore, they may remain capable of producing low levels of effector 500 molecules in response to environmental inflammatory factors that are constitutively observed in 501 aged tissues [22, 27]. Alternatively, it is possible that enhanced accumulation of those 502 \"functionally-intact\" TRM cells such as D b -PA TRM cells may be responsible for the persistent 503 tissue inflammation and fibrosis in aged hosts. Additionally, TRM cells in aged mice may have 504 different traits than TRM cells in young mice [63, 64], thereby causing increased lung 505 inflammation and tissue fibrosis. 506 507 Aging is associated with enhanced development of a number of chronic lung diseases including 508 chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis [65]. Interestingly, 509 aging is also associated with increased susceptibility of acute lung injury and severe disease 510 development following respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 [17, 511 66, 67]. Increasing evidence has suggested that acute viral infections may cause persistent lung 512 function impairments due to pulmonary fibrosis [20]. Indeed, lung fibrosis is well-documented in 513 a substantial number of patients who have recovered from the infection of SARS-CoV or MERS-514 CoV [68, 69] and a group of influenza patients with severe acute diseases [20]. Emerging 515 evidence has also suggested that COVID-19 survivors will likely exhibit persistent impairment 516 of lung function and the development of pulmonary fibrosis [21, 70-74]. Data presented here 517 suggests for the first time that excessive TRM cells are likely the cause of chronic lung diseases 518 and pulmonary fibrosis following viral pneumonia in aged individuals. Of note, recent data on 519 scRNAseq analyses have suggested that pulmonary T cells from COVID-19 patients are enriched 520 with TRM signature and CD8 + T cell clonal expansion in the airways 521 (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690). Thus, strategies aimed at decreasing 522 exuberant TRM responses and/or inhibiting the pathogenic potential of TRM cells may be 523 promising in treating chronic lung diseases following viral pneumonia in the elderly, including 524 COVID-19 survivors. 525 526",

Single-cell libraries were prepared using the 659 Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent kit (10x Genomics) following manufacturer's instruction. 660Paired-end sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in rapid-run mode. 661CellRanger software package (10x Genomics) were used to align and quantify sequencing data 662 from 10x Genomics. All scRNA-seq analyses were performed in R using the Seurat extracted from bulk lung samples with trizol. After quality control, high quality 667 (Agilent Bioanalyzer RIN >7.0) total RNA was used to generate the RNA sequencing library.668 cDNA synthesis, end-repair, A-base addition, and ligation of the Illumina indexed adapters were 669 performed according to the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The 670 concentration and size distribution of the completed libraries was determined using an Agilent 671 Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Santa Clara, CA) and Qubit fluorometry (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 672 CA). Paired-end libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 following Illumina's 673 standard protocol using the Illumina cBot and HiSeq 3000/4000 PE Cluster Kit. Base-calling was 674 performed using Illumina's RTA software (version 2.5.2). Paired-end RNA-seq reads were 675 aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38/mm10) using RNA-seq spliced read mapper 676 Tophat2 (v2.1.1). Pre-and post-alignment quality controls, gene level raw read count and 677 normalized read count (i.e. FPKM) were performed using RSeQC package (v2.3.6) with NCBI 678 mouse RefSeq gene model. For functional analysis, GSEA was used to identify enriched gene sets, from the hallmark and C5 databases of MSigDB, having up-regulated and down-regulated 680 genes, using a weighted enrichment statistic and a log2 ratio metric for ranking genes. 681 682 Statistical analysis. Quantitative data are presented as mean \u00b1 Standard of Deviation. Unpaired 683 two-tailed Student's t-test (two-tailed, unequal variance) was used to determine statistical 684 significance with Prism software (Graphpad). Where appropriate, ANOVA corrected for 685 multiple comparisons was used (Graphpad). We considered p < 0.05 as significant in all 686 statistical tests and denoted within figures as a * for each order of magnitude p value.
