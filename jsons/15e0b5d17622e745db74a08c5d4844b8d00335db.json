The three columns in the top pane portray k = 3 realisations from an epidemic process, which in this case is the Poissontype process described in the main text. The columns consist of two time series plots each, which depict the simulated case counts for the two age groups (call them I and J) across 17 time steps. The time series are symbolised with a symbol length of m = 2, yielding the character strings beneath the first set of arrows. An A represents an increase and a B represents a decrease.

In the SDI-ILI dataset, the age groups are partitioned such that these younger age 292 groups span fewer years, and therefore tend to contain fewer individuals, than the older age 293 groups.

The curves are produced by simulating 100 ensembles of 800 epidemics each from the stochastic SIR model for each value of z a and z b between 0 and 1 in steps of 0.1 (see Eqs 3 and 4), and then calculating the between-group STE for each ensemble. 300 We do not currently advocate using STE on its own to guide vaccination strategies. A full 301 description of the contexts in which STE accurately identifies which population groups to vaccinate 302 in order to maximally reduce the final size of an outbreak lies beyond the scope of this paper. 303 Here, we present preliminary data showing that, under the modelling assumptions presented in 304 this paper, vaccinating groups with higher STE tends to more effectively reduce the mean final 305 size of simulated outbreaks. 306 We generated 100 random 4\u00d74 relative reproduction matrices by choosing each element ac-307 cording to a uniform(0,1) distribution. For each relative reproduction matrix, we used the Poisson 308 outbreak model to generate a single ensemble of 800 outbreaks. For each ensemble, we calcu-309 lated the pairwise STE between age groups. Then, for each relative reproduction matrix in the 310 original set, we simulated 500 more outbreaks with group 1 vaccinated, 500 outbreaks with group 311 2 vaccinated, and so on. To simulate vaccination, we simply did not allow members of the vacci-312 nated group to become infected. From each vaccination scenario and each relative reproduction 313 matrix, we calculated the mean final outbreak size using these 500 simulations. This allowed us to 314 link the total STE 'from' a given age group (to all other age groups) to the mean final outbreak size 315 that would result if that age group were vaccinated, given a relative reproduction matrix.

S46 for each week and each age group in each location, and the pairwise 340 STE is re-calculated. This is repeated 100 times. The reporting rate c is assumed to be 60% 341 for ages 0-19 years, and 40% for ages 20 and above, following the ILI reporting rate estimates Table S3 . It is possible to identify which symbols carry the most information in a given stochastic process. 376 For example, if one time series has the symbol A at time t, it is possible to identify whether this 377 provides more information about which symbol another time series will display at time t + 1 than if 378 the first time series had a different symbol at time t. This is done by separating the STE calculation 379 in Eq. S7 into parts. The amount of information that an A in process J at time t \u2212 1 provides about 380 whether the symbol in process I is a B at time t is ",

The more information the symbol in the child time series carries about the symbol in the age-aggregated time series, the darker the corresponding square. The steadily-increasing and steadilydecreasing symbols (A and F ) carry the most information, and tend to predict the same symbol in the age-aggregated time series. asymmetric transmissive relationships between epidemiological groups. 404 We first used SIR-type stochastic epidemic simulations as described in the main text, Section FIGURE S18. Mean (95% CI) Group 1\u21922 (blue) and Group 2\u21921 (black) STE values as the coupling between the two groups ranges from none to fully symmetric (A), and from fully symmetric to strongly driven by Group 1 (B). The curves are produced by simulating 100 ensembles of 800 epidemics each from the stochastic SIR model for each value of z a and z b between 0 and 1 in steps of 0.1, and then calculating the between-group STE for each ensemble. The epidemic time series are symbolised using the reduced four-symbol alphabet, collapsing symbols B and E as well as symbols C and D from the standard m = 3 symbolization. The relative reproduction matrices that capture these two coupling scenarios are given in Eqs 3 and 4 (main text).",

This matches with what one might expect from the 167epidemiological dynamics: when R > 1, the age group with more infected individuals causes the 168 majority of new infections, and so has a higher contextual STE. When R < 1, interestingly, the 169 reverse is true; the contextual STE is higher from the group with fewer cases. This is a spurious 170 result arising from the STE not taking into account the underlying epidemic process. Clearly, 171 epidemic decay is not 'driven' in the same way transmission is; decay is governed by individual 172 recovery rates, and not by interactions between individuals. STE, however, searches simply for 173 patterns in one process that predict patterns in another. During an epidemic's decay, one age 174 group's dropping case counts may well anticipate drops in another group's case counts simply 175 because the depletion of susceptibles in the first age group occurs earlier than in the second. The 176 contextual STE identifies this relationship, and identifies the process with fewer cases as the one 177 that is driving the decay. This suggests that caution is warranted when interpreting differences 178 in STE; it must always be done with reference to the underlying epidemiological dynamics. In 179 future work, it may be worthwhile to consider incorporating epidemiological intuition explicitly into 180 the STE formulation; the simplest way to do this may be to restrict attention to only symbols that 181 represent rises in amplitude. To summarise, when intrinsic within-and between-group rates of 182 transmission are equal (r given by Eq S37), the relative number of cases at time t \u2212 1 dictates 183 which group transfers the most information to the other.

Using the SDI-ILI data, the symbol-specific STE is calculated from the three school-aged-children age groups (5-19, 10-14, and 15-19 years) to the age-aggregated time series in 384 their same ZIP. The values are depicted in Fig S17. A symbol A (steadily increasing) in the child 385 time series provides a lot of information that there will be an A in the overall time series at the 386 next time step, and similarly for the symbol F (steadily decreasing). Symbols that end on an in-387 crease/decrease tend to predict symbols that also end on an increase/decrease, though there are 388 exceptions. Overall, this suggests that the most informative symbols are strong increases and 389 strong decreases (symbols A and F ), which matches with the intuition that repeated increases 390 and decreases in ILI tend to correspond to takeoffs of infection or declines in infection -epidemi-391 ologically relevant events that should affect the dynamics in other time series and thus transmit 392 information to them.

On the other hand, reducing the symbol space, say from 6 symbols down to 4, could be 398 computationally advantageous: with fewer possible transitions between symbols, it will be easier 399 to estimate the remaining transition probabilities using fewer time series replicates. Here, we 400 test whether an abridged version of the m = 3 symbolization, in which symbols B and E now 401 constitute a single symbol and symbols C and D constitute another single symbol, such that the 402 relative ordering of the first and last points in each triplet is ignored, is equally capable of identifying",
