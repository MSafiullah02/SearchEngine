Assessment of laboratory test utilization usually relies on data compiled after a utilization review or analysis of the necessity, appropriateness, and effi ciency of laboratory tests on a concurrent and/or retrospective basis. Most laboratory utilization studies have been reported from academic medical centers [ 1 -8 ] , however, there are often common fi ndings in large community hospital settings [ 9 -13 ] . The major difference between an academic center and community healthcare system is usually the number of hospital-employed physicians versus independent physicians with their own offi ce practices. Some large community hospitals have only employed physicians on their medical staff like Kaiser Permanente, Henry Ford Hospital, and others. Generally, it will be easier to assemble a group of specialists to convene a laboratory utilization committee meeting, if the physicians are accustomed to leaving their practice responsibilities and going to a hospital-oriented committee meeting in the middle of the day. Since the focus of this committee is to review the evidence-based evaluation of a new or old laboratory test to rule in or out a specifi c disease, attendance and the quality of participation will vary depending on the physician's commitment to the project.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 449, "end": 457, "text": "[ 1 -8 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 539, "end": 548, "text": "[ 9 -13 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 129, "text": "(Table 14", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In a large community hospital, it may \"save time\" during these meetings if homework is assigned beforehand. \"This includes what do people need to read, think about, bring with them, or come prepared to discuss so the meeting will be more productive\" [ 14 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 250, "end": 256, "text": "[ 14 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "One of the authors (FLK) has worked for 23 years directing the clinical laboratory and outreach laboratory at a large community hospital (William Beaumont Hospital) in Royal Oak, MI and for the past 9 years at a six hospital county healthcare system (Memorial Healthcare System) in Hollywood, FL with the co-author (RCA).

The \"key motivation for hospital acquisition of physician practices is the ability to gain market share for inpatient admissions and outpatient services by capturing referrals from physicians employed by the owned practices\" [ 16 ] . Carlin et al.

This same shift of referral patterns to the new hospital owner will also be true for laboratory tests ordered by newly acquired physician practices.

Their average starting salary was greater than that for internal medicine or family practice physicians in 2014 [ 18 ] . Hospitalists work strictly in the hospital and oversee the care of complex patients with the goal of reducing the need of transferring patients from one physician to another [ 22 ] . Most large community hospitals use a voluntary hospitalist system in which primary care physicians can choose to admit to a hospitalist service or attend to their own patients [ 23 ] . Large community hospitals are more likely to adopt a hospitalist model if their case mix complexity was greater than the national average for Medicare's diagnosis rated group index, while high health maintenance organization market share resulted in lower interest in this model [ 22 ] . The hypothesis that the hospitalist model will lead to a reduction in the patient's length of stay and total hospital costs has been demonstrated [ 20 , 22 -24 ] . Hospitalists may order excessive diagnostic tests secondary to their lack of previous knowledge of the patient [ 20 ] .

In a quality improvement project focused on hospitalists, an effort was made through education to reduce the repetitive use of complete blood counts and basic metabolic panels [ 25 ] . These panels are often embedded in order sets established for specifi c diseases or for specifi c physicians to simplify computerized physician order entry [ 28 ] .

It also can occur when a cost is lower than the original expense that would have otherwise been required if the cost avoidance exercise had not been undertaken. Since processes consume overhead and overheard costs money, any signifi cant process improvement could represent signifi cant cost avoidance for an organization. Total cost includes direct and indirect costs [ 48 ] . Direct cost includes personnel time to prepare and perform the test, reagents, quality control, profi ciency testing, and equipment depreciation. Indirect costs including reporting costs (computer) and hospital overhead. Incremental or marginal costs include only variable direct costs and not the indirect costs [ 48 -50 ] . Therefore, incremental costs demonstrate what it would cost to perform one more laboratory test, assuming the equipment and facility are already available. Neither total cost analysis nor incremental cost analysis includes an analysis of the defect rate or failure to achieve established goals, like turn-around time [ 50 ] . They are defi ned as internal or external failure rates. Internal failure costs are incurred by the testing center as a consequence of a defect in the testing system. The receiver of the test results incurs the external failure costs.

A molecular test for Enterovirus detection will alter the patient's length of stay in the emergency department. If the patient is positive for Enterovirus in the CSF specimen, the patient will be discharged for home care until the viral meningitis resolves (Table 14. 2 ). If the patient does not have Enterovirus in the CSF, they will need further hospitalization to rule out a bac-terial source for the meningitis with culture and sensitivity studies (Table 14. 2 ).

In the early 1990s, the number of inpatient laboratory tests at William Beaumont Hospital began to decrease. To fi ll the gap, after a 3-year preparation period, we initiated an outreach program (Beaumont Reference Laboratory) expanding our laboratory testing services to non-patients from physician offi ces, nursing homes, and other hospitals [ 53 , 54 ] . Several years later (1992) Beaumont Reference Laboratory joined a regional laboratory network of other hospital-based laboratory outreach programs in Michigan, Joint Venture Hospital Laboratories , to accommodate the wide geographic coverage required by third party payers [ 53 , 54 ] . The participating laboratories are independently owned and operated. A central network administrator coordinates negotiations for managed care contracts. The volume of BRL specimens grew to half of the total volume of clinical pathology procedures of six million tests in 2004. This increased volume permitted an expansion of the test menu in each laboratory section. In 2002, we reviewed 2,976,494 procedures ordered by 2806 physicians in nine subspecialty areas (family practice, pediatrics , internal medicine, cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, nursing home, OB/GYN, and urology). The requisitions for physician, procedures per requisition and procedures/physician were calculated for each of the nine groups of physicians [ 54 ] . Family practice (464 physicians) and internal medicine (831) ordered the greatest number of total procedures as well as procedures/physician while urology (126) ordered the least of these two categories [ 54 ] . The tests ordered by each of the nine groups were counted in seven laboratory sections. All nine groups ordered more chemistry tests than any other category but the percent varied from 34.5 % for OB/GYN to 90.2 % for internal medicine. The most popular individual tests in fi ve laboratory sections (chemistry, hematology, immunology, microbiology, and molecular diagnostics) were calculated as an average number of a specifi c test ordered per physician per month. Using this data, a laboratory section could prepare themselves for the increased utilization from a six-member internal medicine group that the Beaumont Reference Laboratory sales force just signed up as a new client. This type of deep dive into specifi c physician specialty ordering patterns is an invaluable resource for managing a growing outreach business [ 54 ] . The 20 million requests for chemistry, hematology, and microbiology tests were included for all physicians in Calgary, Canada who ordered a test in fi scal year 2013-2014 [ 55 ] . The physicians were divided into 30 subspecialties and the average yearly cost per group and average yearly cost per physician in each of the 30 groups was calculated. Family practice and internal medicine had the greatest average yearly cost per group while hematology and nephrology had the highest average yearly cost per physician per group secondary to utilization of more expensive laboratory tests [ 55 ] .

Why was there an exceptionally low NG volume from Hospital B? After an investigation it was learned that Hospital B chose to do the less sensitive NG culture assay [ 56 ] to retain laboratory test volume which was encouraged by their hospital administration. Also, a myth existed at hospital B that NG would not survive the transport time (40-60 min) to hospital A. The ordering physicians at hospital B prevailed and the request for molecular detection of NG at hospital B was followed.

An effective way to evaluate whether a test has become obsolete is to review it at the Laboratory Utilization Committee that is responsible for the laboratory formulary [ 172 ] . The formulary concept comes from the play book of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee that approve medication for use by medical providers and under what circumstances. When a newer more effective drug is FDA approved it may replace an older less effective drug in the formulary. In the laboratory, the perfect obsolete test cannot be ordered by a medical provider because the reagents are no longer provided by the in vitro diagnostics industry. For example, protein bound iodine (PBI) [ 169 ] is no longer available at any reference laboratory because the test reagents are no longer manufactured. However, T3 uptake is just as obsolete and useless; however, its reagents are still manufactured by many vendors and still offered by reference laboratories [ 12 ] . In a utilization review of our hospital's send out test volume, it was asked by the reference laboratory why physicians ordered so many T3 uptake assays from them. I said it is not on our formulary just like CK MB [ 164 -166 ] , but both of these obsolete tests and others are still ordered and performed by your reference laboratory. The response was \"we offer the test because physicians order the test,\" however, if the reagents were not available from the manufacturer, it is unlikely the reference laboratory would develop a laboratory developed test to support obsolescence. The workaround for removal of the obsolete tests from the hospital laboratory formulary usually involves the use of an EMR that has reference laboratory test ordering built for the convenience of the medical providers. If this feature is not inactivated for inpatients the hospital laboratory formulary develops a leak from which a fl ood of abuse can originate. Until locally defi ned obsolete tests are universally accepted and eliminated from the test lists of hospitals, manufacturers, and reference laboratories, the discovery of ingenious work-arounds will occupy the time of the medical providers who by habit are accustomed to having the obsolete test results by their side.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 87, "end": 104, "text": "[ 12 , 164 -171 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 276, "end": 283, "text": "[ 172 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 777, "end": 784, "text": "[ 169 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1053, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1282, "text": "[ 164 -166 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 72, "end": 81, "text": "(Table 14", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Obsolete Tests"}, {"text": "The utilization management of laboratory tests in a large community hospital is similar to academic and smaller community hospitals.
