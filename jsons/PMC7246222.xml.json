Their visits should be maintained in all Medical and Radiation Oncology departments, with the consequent increased risk of Covid-19. In a Chinese series, an increase in Covid-19 incidence in oncology population was described, attributing it to the maintenance of visits to the hospital without performing any Covid-19 screening [7]. Another recent study described an increase in more serious cases in cancer patients due to their acquired immunosuppression status, especially those who are receiving specific treatment [8]. However, another report described similar characteristics and infection rate, but they detected most infected patients were cancer survivors, without active cancer disease or any recent specific treatment received [9].",
