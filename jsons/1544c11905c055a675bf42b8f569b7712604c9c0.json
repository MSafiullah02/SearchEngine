Studies in the last decade have described the diverse arrays of pathways and molecular targets that are used by viruses to elude immune detection or destruction, or both. These include targeting of pathways for major histocompatibility complex class I and class II antigen presentation, natural killer cell recognition, apoptosis, cytokine signalling, and complement activation. This paper provides an overview of the viral immune-evasion mechanisms described to date. It highlights the contribution of this field to our understanding of the immune system, and the importance of understanding this aspect of the biology of viral infection to develop efficacious and safe vaccines.",

The evasion strategies that viruses have devised are highly diverse, ranging from the passive to the active. Passive evasion strategies comprise hiding inside the infected host cell in a dormant form or creating a broad antigenetic diversity among the progeny virions during each replication cycle (as exploited, for example, by retroviruses), thus evading or staying one step ahead of the immune response. Active mechanisms include interferences with pathways for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II antigen presentation, natural killer (NK) cell recognition, cytokine signalling, apoptosis of infected cells, and complement activation. In this review, the authors provide an overview of the different active mechanisms that viruses use to evade host immune responses. Due to space constraints, those mechanisms will be presented concisely in pairs of associated figures and tables. The basic concepts of the components of the immune system targeted by the viruses are described in the figures, while viral strategies are listed in the corresponding tables. To save space, viruses are cited using the abbreviations of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses.",

            "text": "CD8-positive cells play an important role in immunity against viruses. Just how important these cells are is demonstrated by the evolution of viral strategies for blocking the genesis or the display of viral peptide-MHC class I complexes on the surface of viral infected cells. To enhance the understanding of this field, the manner in which viral proteins are processed for recognition by virus-specific CD8+ T cells is briefly described (Figure 1 ). In the infected cells, peptides are generated from by-products of proteasomal degradation. Most of the substrates consist of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). Peptides are then transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the TAP protein. Here, MHC class I molecules are folded through the actions of general purpose molecular chaperones working with a dedicated chaperone (Tapasin) that tethers MHC class 1 to TAP. After peptide binding, MHC class I molecules dissociate from TAP, leave the ER and migrate to the plasma membrane through the Golgi complex. As viral peptide-MHC class I complexes accumulate on the cell surface, they have a greater chance of triggering activation by CD8+ T cells with a cognate receptor. Viruses have been shown to interfere with virtually every step of T cell antigen processing and presentation ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ). The viral proteins involved in such mechanisms have been called VIPRs (pronounced \"viper\") for viral proteins interfering with antigen presentation. They are listed in Table 1 together with their mechanism of action. For an excellent review on this subject, see that of Yewdell and Hill (2002) . The classical MHC class I pathway is depicted with reference to viral interfering proteins listed in Table 1 . Peptides are derived from DRiPs through the action of proteasomes and transported into the ER by the TAP protein. Nascent MHC class I molecules bind to TAP via tapasin. Binding of peptide to MHC class I molecules releases them from the ER. Peptide-MHC class I molecules then migrate to the cell surface. VIPRs have been shown to interfere with virtually every step of T cell antigen processing and presentation, namely (1) prevention of peptide degradation; (2) inhibition of peptide translocation in the ER, the inhibitory viral protein being either on the cytosolic side (2a) or in the lumen of the ER (2b); (3) retention of MHC class I molecules in the ER (3a) or in the transGolgi network (TGN) (3c), or by targeting of ER MHC class I molecules for degradation by the proteoasomes (3b); (4) reduction of peptide-MHC class I complexes exposed on the cell surface by inhibition of their migration to the cell surface, by increasing their endocytosis from the cell surface and by increasing their degradation into lysosomes; and (5) inhibition of T CD8+ cell recognition of cell surface peptide-MHC class I complexes. The VIPRs acting at those steps are listed in Table 1 . Yin, Maoury and Fahraeus, 2003 . [3] Gilbert et al., 1993 . [4] Galocha et al., 1997 . [6] Hinkley, Hill and Srikumaran, 1998 .

[28] Kleijnen et al., 1997 . Viral mechanisms interfering with NK cell functions fall into five categories, namely (1) expression of virally encoded MHC class I homologues that serve as NK cell decoys and ligate inhibitory receptors to block NK cytotoxicity; (2) selective modulation of MHC class I allele expression. Some viruses are able to down-regulate MHC class I molecules that are efficient for presentation of viral peptides to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (such as HLA-A and HLA-B) without affecting or even increasing the expression of HLA-C and HLA-E, the dominant ligands for NK cell inhibitory receptors; (3) through the various mechanisms listed in Table 2 , some viruses are capable of inhibiting the function of NK activatory receptor; (4) other viruses interfere with the cytokine pathways relevant to NK cell activation by producing virally encoded cytokine-binding proteins or cytokine antagonist; and (5) viruses can also directly inhibit NK cells by infecting them or by using viral envelope proteins to ligate NK cell inhibitory receptor.",

They are capable of mediating cytotoxic activity and producing cytokines after ligation of a variety of germline-encoded receptors. Like CD8+ T cells, NK cells mediate direct lysis of target cells by releasing cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes, or by binding to apoptosis-inducing receptors on the target cells. Several receptors that can activate NK cells have been identified, among which some recognize viral proteins (Orange et al., 2002) . Due to the possible consequences of NK cell activation, normal host cells must inhibit NK activity. Various inhibitory receptors are consistently expressed by a subset of NK cells. These receptors bind to host MHC class I molecules and transmit inhibitory signals to the NK cells.",

            "text": "As noted above, many viruses have acquired effective means of avoiding T cell antigen presentation, thus avoiding T cell adaptive immune response. However, by eluding T cells, the viruses might have increased their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated defences. Consequently, in addition to the inhibition of T cell antigen presentation, some viruses have also acquired mechanisms to evade the action of NK cells. These mechanisms fall into five categories, presented in Figure 2 ; the viruses known to have acquired such mechanisms are listed Table 2 . For an excellent review of the viral evasion of NK cells, see Orange et al. (2002) . MHC class II and chains and the invariant chain (Li) are expressed constitutively or in response to IFN-g stimulation. These molecules assemble in the ER to form the --Li complexes that are then transported from the ER through the Golgi apparatus to the TGN, where the complexes are sorted to endosomes in response to signals present in the cytoplasmic tail of Li. In early endosomes, Li is progressively degraded by low-pH proteases so that fragments of it remain bound to the peptide-binding groove formed by the -chains. The MHC class II complexes then traffic into more acidic late endosomes and prelysosomal compartments known as MHC class II loading compartment (MIIC). Viral antigens can reach the endocytic pathway by phagocytosis, endocytosis or recycling of internal vesicules (site of virus assembly). Antigens delivered into the endocytic pathway are degraded by aciddependent proteases to form peptides that are delivered to MIIC and loaded onto MHC class II -dimers. Exchange of peptide antigens for Li fragments occurs in collaboration with class II-like -dimers called DM. From the MIIC, peptide-loaded class II moves to the cell surface for presentation to CD4+ T cells. Viral mechanisms interfering with MHC class II antigen presentation fall into 5 categories: (1) inhibition of the IFN-transduction cascade leading to the expression of MHC class II; (2) Inhibition of the association of the and chains with the Li chains; (3) redirecting the and b chains and DM for degradation by the proteasome; (4) preventing MHC class II from reaching the endocytic compartment; and (5) interfering with MHC class II processing and acidification of the endosome.",

A very large number of cytokines induce mechanisms that enhance immune recognition, or immune responses that protect against viral infection. Finally, some antiviral cytokines mediate killing of infected cells by NK cells or cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

These cells (cytolytic T cells and NK cells) induce cell death by secretion of cytotoxic cytokines such as TNFs and by processes requiring direct cell-cell contact, such as release of perforin and granzyme. This form of programmed cell death is called apoptosis. Apoptosis is an orchestrated biochemical process that leads ultimately to the demise of the cell, initiated by both internal sensors (intrinsic pathway, mitochondria dependent) and external stimuli (extrinsic pathway, death receptor mediated). Apoptosis can be initiated by two main pathways. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by death ligands binding to their cognate death receptors. These receptors then multimerize and their death domains (DDs) interact with the DDs of adaptator proteins that bind to pro-caspase 8 and/or pro-caspase 10 to form the DISC. This ends with pro-caspase cleavage in their active form. These caspases can then cleave Bid and activate the effector caspase cascade. On the other end, internal sensors initiate the intrinsic pathway via a process that results in heterooligomeric pores formation in the outer membrane of the mitochondria. Factors such as cytochrom c, Smac and Omi are then released in the cytoplasm where cytochrom c promotes formation of the apoptosome, resulting in autocatalytic activation of caspase 9, which initiates the effector caspase cascade. Caspases activation is negatively regulated by IAP, which are counter-balanced by proapoptotic Smac and Omi. Viral mechanisms of apoptosis inhibition fall into 4 main categories: (1) modulating of death receptors signalling; (2) regulation of caspase; (3) mimicking Bcl-2; and (4) blinding the internal sensors.",

Many viruses have acquired mechanisms to inhibit this important biological process, by targeting different steps.

Complement is part of the innate immune system and is activated in a cascade manner through two main pathways, known as the classical and the alternative pathways. The classical pathway is activated by the recognition proteins C1q or mannose-binding lectin, which bind respectively to charge clusters or neutral sugars on targets. In contrast, activation of the alternative pathway is a default process that proceeds unless down-regulated by specific mechanisms. Complement activation results in cleavage and activation of C3 and deposition of opsonic C3 fragments on surfaces. Subsequent cleavage of C5 leads to assembly of the membrane attack complex (C5b,6,7,8,9) , which disrupts lipid bilayers. Viruses have developed different strategies acting at different stages of the complement cascade in order to evade complement-mediated destruction. These are listed in Table 6 , and are referred to in this figure. These strategies fall into three main categories: (1) some viruses interfere with the classical pathway by avoiding complement binding to antibody-antigen complexes, either by shedding or internalization of these complexes from the cell surface or by expressing virallyencoded Fc receptor on the cell surface; (2) other viruses encode and express functional homologue of cellular regulators of complement activation (RCA), protecting their lipid envelope and the membrane of the infected cell; and (3) some viruses can incorporate host complement RCA in their envelope and/or up-regulate expression of these proteins in infected cells.",

The review of the immune evasion strategies acquired by viruses revealed several fascinating aspects of this field. First, it is remarkable that individual virus families have targeted many common immunological principles. Second, the analysis of viral immunoregulatory proteins revealed that they belong to two classes: those encoded by genes with and those encoded by genes without sequence homology to cellular genes. While the former indicates that viruses have \"stolen\" genes from the host that were subsequently modified for the benefit of the virus, the latter suggests acquisitions through a mechanism of convergent evolution.",

On the one hand, they need to impair the immune response of their host to be able to replicate and to avoid eradication; but, on the other hand, they need to respect the host immune response in order to ensure their host's (and hence their own) survival. In other words, the perfect adaptation of a virus to its host would represent a virus able to complete its biological cycle without inducing clinical symptoms. Further studies are required to determine the roles of viral immune-evasion mechanisms in this delicate equilibrium. Indeed, most of the studies cited in this review have investigated the ability of viral genes to interfere with the host immune response in vitro. However, only in vivo experiments will be able to determine the real biological functions of these viral immune-evasion mechanisms. A beautiful example supporting this statement has been provided by the study of vaccinia virus IL-1\u03b2 receptor. Indeed, while this viral product was thought to contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus, it is interesting to observe that deletion of the corresponding gene enhanced virus virulence and the onset of fever, suggesting that the purpose of a least some of the immune-evasion mechanisms is to reduce immunopathology caused by viral infection (Alcami and Smith, 1996) .",
