Amongst them new antimetabolite pyrimidine analogues, i.e. Cytarabine [1], [2], [3], [4], Enocitabine [4], [5], [6], are related to a 1-\u03b2-d-arabinofuranoside synthon (Fig. 1\n). As part of our research program, we developed the synthesis of a new series of original 1-\u03b2-d-arabino furan[1\u2032,2\u2032:4,5]oxazolo- and arabino-pyrimidinones via 2-amino-2-oxazoline derivatives possessing a 1-\u03b2-d-arabinosyl parent. 2-Amino-2-oxazolines are heteroamidine synthons useful for the preparation of various bioactive pyrimidinones through ring annulation, by using the two nucleophilic sites of the amidine moiety. We already developed this approach for obtaining various bicyclic compounds [7], [8], [9].",

The N,N\u2032-dimethyl-N\u2032-alkylformamide 3 was engaged in an alkylation with diketene acetone adduct, followed by spontaneous elimination of dimethylamine, to give the fused \u03b2-d-arabinofuran[1\u2032,2\u2032:4,5]oxazolopyrimidin-6-one 4. The oxazoline ring opening was then conducted in dilute aqueous ammonia [11], [12] to afford the surprising arabinofurano-pyrimidinedione 5 bearing an enamine function. Structural elucidation of 5 was achieved either by 1H and 13C NMR, and by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 2\n). Especially, 1H NMR spectrum of 5 revealed two D2O exchangeable singlets at 9.93 and 10.84 ppm characteristics of the enamine group in position 5. Moreover, the 13C NMR spectrum of 5 showed one signal around 98.4 ppm specific for the enamine alkene bond (\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nC(Me)NH2). The X-ray crystallography data of 5 unambiguously showed the presence two hydrogen on the N(9), whereas the Csp\n2(8)-N(9) bond was found at 1.292(2) \u00c5, as typically observed for CC\u2013NH2 bonds [15]. There is an intramolecular hydrogen bond between N(9)\u2013H(9A) and O(7) where the N(9)\u2013O(7) distance is 2.673(2) &angst. Moreover, N(9) is hydrogen bonded to O(11) of the molecule at (x\n \u2212 1,\u2212y\n \u2212 1, +z) with N(9)\u2013H(9B)\u2013O(11) = 2.814(3) \u00c5; other hydrogen bond are found between O(18) and N(5) of the molecule (x, y, z\n \u2212 1) where the distance is 2.823(2) \u00c5, and O(20) and O(17) of the molecule (x\u22121, y\n + 1, z) with O(20)\u2026O(17) = 2.813(2) &angst. The most common type of pucker of sugar rings in nucleosides and nucleotides is with either atom C(14) or atom C(15) displaced from the plane of the other four atoms on the same side as atom C(19), when the pucker is called C(14) or C(15) endo, respectively. In the structure of 5, the pucker is C(14) endo differing from that observed in previously described uracil-\u03b2-d-arabinofuranoside [16] where the pucker is C(14) endo making impossible an intramolecular hydrogen bond between O(20) and O(17). Finally, spatial structure of 5 also confirmed that the oxazoline ring opening did not modify the C-1 and C-2 absolute configuration of arabinose. Based on the space group determined from crystallographic data (P1), the absolute configurations at C-1 and C-2 of this pure enantiomer were determined to be R and S, respectively. The formation of 5 was probably due to the action of ammonia on the acetyl substituent leading to an imine function which gave the stable enamine group after alkaline oxazoline ring opening.",

When reacted at room temperature with 1, only the fused pyrimidinone 7 bearing a \u03b2-keto ester moiety was obtained, probably due to the regioselectivity in term of nitrogen reactivity as previously observed in the 2-amino-2-oxazoline series [17].

This synthesis illustrates the nucleophilic reactivity of both nitrogen atoms of 2-amino-2-oxazolines [9]. Thus, the endocyclic nitrogen atom attacks first the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of ethyl-2-oxocyclohexane-carboxylate, followed by the exocyclic nitrogen attack on the carboxyl carbon (afterwards) to achieve cyclisation. The resulting unstable cyclic \u03b2-hydroxyketone is then dehydrated to give 12. On the other hand, compound 13 was obtained after dehydration when the two nitrogen atom attacks order was reversed. After separation these two regioisomers were obtained in 41% and 30% yields, respectively. Each structure has been probed by NMR analysis. Thus, a NOE effect between the H-3\u2032 arabinose proton and one methylene proton of the fused cyclohexyl moiety was observed for compound 13, while no correlation was observed between the two corresponding protons in 12\n[9]. For the unequivocal assignment of the two different possible structures, X-ray single crystal analyses were performed with 12 (Fig. 4\n) and 13 (Fig. 5\n). The 3D structures of 12 and 13 confirmed the isomerization, as anticipated on the basis of NOESY data. Both regioisomers 12 and 13 are characterized by a quasi-planar conformation of the oxazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine moiety with dihedral angle between the mean planes of the pyrimidine base and the sugar ring = 72.6(7)\u00b0 and 71.4(10)\u00b0, respectively. In compound 12, the maximum deviation from planarity for the tricyclic cyclohexa-oxazolo-pyrimidinone moiety is found lying 0.368 \u00c5, while in 13, C(5) deviates by 0.189 \u00c5 from the plane in the cyclohexenyl cycle. The C(8)\u2013N(7) and C(1)\u2013C(6) bonds in 12 were 1.277(7) and 1.388(9) \u00c5, respectively, as typically observed for double bonds. In compound 13, the distances in the pyrimidine ring were 1.285(10) \u00c5 for C(8)\u2013N(9), and 1.346(11) \u00c5 for C(1)\u2013C(2).",

It must be noted that during this ring opening process, the heterocyclic ring of 11 is structurally rather different from its precursor in compound 10, since an enamine group now replaces the acetyl group. Both groups could be considered as bioisosteres, and may be involved in the biological binding site of compounds 10 and 11.

As expected the silylated compounds are the most lipophilic ones. This lipophilic character of 9\u201313 could explain, in a first part, a better permeability, leading to a better cell penetration in vitro. On the other hand, comparable Clog P differences are found between corresponding values calculated for 10 and 4, and 5 and 11, respectively. These desilylated pyrimidinones 4 and 5 showed lower activities with IC50 ranging from 211 to 380 \u03bcM on the three cell lines. The tetracylic fused isomeric pyrimidinones 12 and 13 also exhibited moderate antitumor activities, with slightly better IC50s for 12 (IC50\n = 201 \u03bcM on L1210, IC50\n = 129 \u03bcM on Molt 4/C8, and IC50\n = 126 \u03bcM on CEM/0). Finally, the moderate results obtained for compound 9 (IC50\n = 215\u2013254 \u03bcM) are rather difficult to discuss since this compound appeared in the early stages of the synthesis, and therefore exhibited a quite different chemical structure compared to the other interesting compounds. Nevertheless, it can be compared to its desilylated analog 3 which showed no activity at all, stressing again the important role of the tert-butyldimethylsilyl groups.",
