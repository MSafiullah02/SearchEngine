This can lead to brain hypoxia and/or carbon dioxide retention, edema, vascular dysfunction, and other pathological changes. These, in turn, can disrupt the brain's higher neural activity. In addition, some drugs used in treatment, such as antiviral drugs, can cause drug-induced mental disorders: for example, glucocorticoids can lead to excitement, depression, tension, insomnia, hallucinations, and other symptoms.4",

Amid a lack of psychological endurance in the public, inappropriate or excessive release of panic-triggering information by television, radio, newspaper, magazine, Internet, and other media sources can have a negative impact on the population. From the perspective of communication psychology, during such times, people tend to carry an affinity for negative, threatening, or informal information and for ignoring or doubting positive and formal information. Furthermore, during disease outbreaks, rumors and speculation abound; authorities in endemic areas take emergency measures, such as sealing cities and roads; streets become quiet; the economy can struggle; the stock market is volatile; there is a rush for supplies and household items; pedestrians remain heavily protected and armed; and advertisements and posters on the disease are ubiquitously posted, all of which can make people feel nervous and scared.",

Through positive communication and psychological nursing, the patient's mood became more stable, and he cooperated with the treatment given until he recovered and left the hospital. Transient mental disorders are caused by a sharp or persistent psychogenic factor.
