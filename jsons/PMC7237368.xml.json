            "text": "A novel viral pneumonia originating from China was announced to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019 (WHO, 2020b). As of March 26, 2020, there were 465,915 confirmed cases and 21,031 confirmed deaths from this coronavirus disease (COVID-19) across the globe (WHO, 2020a). This pandemic has rapidly and profoundly affected every part of daily life, from the way people work, live, shop, socialize, and plan for the future. Although the psychological impact of these changes has been well documented by the media, the mental health care needs of those suffering from this crisis have been relatively neglected (Xiang et al., 2020). This is surprising, given that research on previous global disease outbreaks has shown that people suffering from pandemic-related anxiety tend to exhibit elevated levels of post-traumatic stress, general stress, anxiety, health anxiety, and suicidality (Chong et al., 2004; Wheaton et al., 2012, Organization, 2020a, March 11, Organization, 2020b, March 27; Wu et al., 2009; Yip, Cheung, Chau, & Law, 2010). Therefore, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS; Lee, 2020) was recently created to help identify those particularly affected by the fear and uncertainty of this growing pandemic crisis (see Table 1\n).",

            "text": "The CAS is a 5-item mental health screener designed to efficiently and effectively aid healthcare professionals and researchers identify probable cases of dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis (Lee, 2020). Each item of the CAS taps a distinct physiologically-based fear or anxiety reaction to coronavirus related thoughts or information. It is important to note that coronavirus anxiety has also been referred to as \u201ccoronaphobia\u201d in this emerging line of research (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020). The CAS was developed using online data of 775 adults who experienced significant anxiety over the infectious disease outbreak. In the study, the CAS demonstrated solid reliability (\u03b1s = .93 for both an exploratory factor analysis subsample and a confirmatory factor analysis subsample), validity (i.e., factorial and construct-related), and measurement equivalence across age, race, and gender. CAS scores were found to be correlated with coronavirus diagnosis, impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as attitudes toward President Trump and Chinese food/products. These correlations support the CAS as a measure of mental health because coronavirus anxiety was related to clinically significant disturbances across psychological, interpersonal, and behavioral processes (Lee, 2020). The CAS exhibited good diagnostic properties (AUC = .94, p < .001) and with an optimized cut score of \u2265 9, it has been able to accurately distinguish between persons with and without dysfunctional anxiety (90% sensitivity and 85% specificity). Although these findings are promising, there have been no other studies to date that examined the reliability of these results. Independent studies investigating the psychometric properties of the CAS are absolutely essential for establishing the scientific legitimacy of this instrument. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the CAS using an online sample of 398 adults.",

Consequently, the proportion of participants suffering from dysfunctional levels of coronavirus anxiety was much smaller for the current study (31.2%) than the original CAS study (54.8%; Lee, 2020). Despite this relative weaker detection rate, it is important to note that a 76% sensitivity rate is still comparable to values reported with other mental health screenings tests, such as the General Health Questionnaire (77% sensitivity; Weinstein et al., 1989), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (76.5% sensitivity; Shean & Baldwin, 2008), the State Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (73% sensitivity; van Dam et al., 2013), and the Distress Thermometer (70% sensitivity; Jacobsen et al., 2005).",

The results supported these expectations with CAS scores being positively correlated with functional impairment, fear about coronavirus, alcohol or drug coping, negative religious coping, extreme hopelessness, and passive suicidal ideation. The only unexpected finding was the lack of correlation between the CAS scores and time spend thinking about and/or watching media about coronavirus. This may due to the fact that the topic of coronavirus saturated media reports when the data for this study was collected (March 23rd and 24th, 2020). Despite this one discrepancy, the findings not only support the construct validity of the CAS by demonstrating clear links with indices of maladjustment and distress, but replicate the findings of the original CAS investigation as well.",

This change in coronavirus anxiety may have to do with the fact that the coronavirus spread at a much higher and lethal rate in the Black community relative to other communities toward the end of March 2020, when this study was conducted (Johnson & Buford, 2020). Asians, on the other hand, did not show elevated rates of coronavirus in their communities during this period of time and therefore did not show signs of considerable coronavirus anxiety. The high coronavirus anxiety observed among Asians, living in the U.S. earlier in March 2020 when the coronavirus was beginning to spread in the U.S., may have reflected their greater sensitivity and awareness of this disease outbreak because of what they learned from their friends and relatives in Asia who were already living through the pandemic crisis. We anticipate that as this pandemic unfolds and affects different pockets of society, so too will the impact of coronavirus anxiety and the research findings for this construct.",

The positive correlation between CAS scores and avoidance of Chinese food and products also follow a trend that occurred during the 2003 SARS outbreak when the \u201cChinese disease\u201d scare led to a mass avoidance of Chinese people and their businesses (Fang, 2020; Keil & Ali, 2006).

However, many healthcare workers around the globe feel the overwhelming strain of this pandemic as the number of infections and deaths rise and the medical resources become scarcer.

If these healthcare workers are not identified and treated appropriately, they could put themselves and others at risk for health complications because they may be too overwhelmed by anxiety to be effective at their jobs. Moreover, as the results of this study and the original CAS investigation suggest, individuals with dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety engage in high levels of drug and alcohol coping and frequently experience suicidal ideation and hopelessness, all of which are extremely problematic in their own right. Therefore, the CAS could be used to alleviate this potential concern. And with the proven success rate of telehealth, particularly in the treatment of anxiety, the delivery of online psychotherapy may be a practical solution to this growing problem (Khatri, Marziali, Tchernikov, & Shepherd, 2014).",

First, the results of this study may not generalize to the population at large because the sample used was not based on a probabilistic sampling method. Instead, the sample used in this study were from MTurk's online labor market. However, systematic research on MTurk has demonstrated that MTurk participants are at least as diverse as typical internet and traditional methods, and the data derived from this source are of high quality (Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011). Nonetheless, researchers should seek to verify this study's results using probabilistic sampling techniques. Second, the use of single-item scales in this study could have oversimplified the results because only one aspect of a construct was measured. Although single-item scales can have comparable psychometric properties as multi-item instruments (Bergkvist & Rossiter, 2007), future research should nonetheless reproduce this study using multi-item scales. Last, the use of only one validity item may not have effectively identified all of the participants who provided invalid answers due to inattention. Future research should incorporate multiple validity items that are scattered throughout the survey to obtain higher quality data. Despite these limitations, this study reports vital data that supports the scientific integrity of a mental health screener of COVID-19 related psychopathology.",
