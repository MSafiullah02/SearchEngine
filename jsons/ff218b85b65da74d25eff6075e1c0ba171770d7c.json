That is how long the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic gave us to adapt individually, socially and professionally to a context never before experienced or even imagined, a scenario of high stress that has already changed our way of life and that of future generations. The uniqueness of the COVID-19 pandemic is that we must adapt to those changes quickly, in a scenario of great uncertainty, and almost with no time to reflect or assimilate it.",
