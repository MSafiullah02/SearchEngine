            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immuno-mediated disease of domestic and exotic felides infected with feline coronavirus (FCoV) (Pedersen, 1995). FIP develops when cats are exposed to variants of FCoV that replicate within macrophages, thereby spreading the virus into target organs. The pathogenesis of FIP is complex and still not well understood. Two positive acute phase proteins, \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and haptoglobin (HP), have been reported to increase during FIP (Duthie et al., 1997). HP concentrations in FIP are approximately twice the maximum value of healthy cats. More interesting, however, is that levels of AGP increase from 0\u20131.5 to 4\u20138 g/l. The biological significance of AGP overexpression during FIP and its correlation with the pathogenesis of the disease are still unknown. AGP is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight ranging from 40 to 44 kDa, depending on the species. One of the most interesting characteristics of AGP is the extent of its carbohydrate moiety, which accounts for approximately the 45% of its molecular weight (Fournier et al., 2000). Glycans are N-linked in the form of five, or six in some species, complex-types, that could, theoretically, increase to more than 105 different glycoforms. So far no more than 12\u201320 glycoforms of AGP have been detected in non-pathological human serum.",

Specifically, AGP inhibits the neutrophils chemotaxis and activation (Vasson et al., 1994) and may be responsible for an increase in IL1 receptor antagonist secretion (Tilg et al., 1993). In vivo experiments further suggest that AGP may be involved in the induction of non-specific resistance to infection, for example by blocking the binding of HIV to the chemokine receptor CCR5 of human macrophages (Atemezem et al., 2001).",

The alterations of the glycan moiety is believed to be important for several AGP immunomodulatory activities. For example, a reduction in the degree of branching of attached oligosaccharides has been correlated to a reduction of IL1 activity (Bories et al., 1990). A change in the amount of fucose residues was found to increase in some human inflammatory diseases, and fucosylated AGP that expresses the sialyl Lewis X (SLeX) epitope could counteract the extravasation of leukocytes, SLeX being the ligand of endothelial selectins (Brinkman-van der Linden et al., 1996, De Graaf et al., 1993). Finally, several defensive functions proposed for AGP can be associated to the sialic acid content: sialic acid is a very important component of membrane glycoproteins, and AGP may therefore act as a competitor for cell surface receptors, blocking the binding and the invasion of infectious agents (Friedman, 1983, Hochepied et al., 2000).",

The reactivity of fAGP with SNAI and MAA has been presented as a density plot in Fig. 2b. The dendrogram displaying the average volume of density profile plots of non-pathological fAGP after reaction with SNAI and MAA is shown in Fig. 2c. The figure shows that the variability in non-infected cats is very low. On the contrary, fAGP glycoforms from healthy cats did not bind to the lectins AAL and ConA. The non-reactivity of fAGP with these two lectins therefore suggests that in non-pathological conditions the protein does not present any fucose residue on its surface, and that the glycoforms with one or more diantennary glycans are limited.",

On the contrary other proteins (lanes 7 and 8) exhibit an increase in the degree of sialylation (123 and 122%, respectively, data not reported). In other cats (lanes 5, 6, 12 and 14) the \u03b1(2\u20136) sialylation of fAGP is not modified during FIP. Histograms in Fig. 4\npresent the semi-quantitative evaluation to the peaks corresponding to fAGP profiles shown in Fig. 3. Using the lectin SNAI, the sialic acid \u03b1(2\u20136)-linked content of fAGP from FIP affected cats decreases to an average of 76% when compared to non-pathological fAGP. We can therefore conclude that the \u03b1(2\u20136) sialylation of fAGP is reduced during FIP. On the contrary, the reaction with MAA lectin (Fig. 3b), that preferentially binds \u03b1(2\u20133)-linked sialic acid residues, showed a marked difference in the binding between non-pathological and pathological fAGP. All except one (fAGP in lane 8) of the pathological fAGP purified in this experiment clearly showed a marked reduction in the reaction with MAA lectin and the decrease was very strong in several cats. Some proteins, for example those in lanes 2, 3, and 6, showed clear desialylation, quantified by densitometry in 11, 7, and 20%, respectively (data not reported) when compared with non-pathologic fAGP. This result strongly supports the hypothesis that there is a marked decrease of the sialic acid residues linked to galactose in position \u03b1(2\u20133). Using the lectin MAA, the sialic acid \u03b1(2\u20133)-linked content of pathological fAGP decreases to an average value of 44% when compared to non-pathological fAGP.",

The most evident post-translational modification during FIP is a decrease in the degree of sialylation.

It is possible that cats may also lack this enzyme. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate that FIP affected cats exhibit a marked modification of sialic acid content such as a reduction (76%) of the sialic acid \u03b1(2\u20136)-linked to galactose, that was particularly marked in several subjects (4 out of 24). In other cats the number of epitopes of \u03b1(2\u20136) sialic acid were unchanged or increased. We therefore may conclude that the \u03b1(2\u20136) desialylation occurs on an individual basis and it is likely correlated with the disease. We also observed a strong reduction (44% if compared to controls) of sialic acid \u03b1(2\u20133)-linked to galactose, from the surface of purified fAGP.

At present, few data are available regarding biological differences between \u03b1(2\u20136) and \u03b1(2\u20133) linkage of sialic acid to galactose. Due to their negative electric charges and the terminal localization, sialic acid residues play a very important role in mediating intercellular recognition events. It is also thought that the sialylation of a glycoprotein exerts an antiproteolytic activity, de facto prolonging the life of the protein. Desialylation causes the molecule to be recognized by galactose specific lectins: this recognition targets the desialylated serum glycoproteins to hepatocytes for their removal from circulation (Lamari and Karamanos, 2002). Moreover, sialic acid is a component of receptors for cytokines, selectins and siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin superfamily lectins) (Traving and Schauer, 1998).",

Is the desialylation of AGP connected with a reduction of the half-life of AGP itself and, therefore, with a reduction of its immunomodulatory properties? The AGP interacts with monocytes, inducing an increase of the secretion of IL-1 receptor antagonist, and modulates the LPS-induced cytokine expression (Fournier et al., 2000). Does the modification of the glycan moiety alter the binding of pathological AGP to monocytes, thus increasing or decreasing the activation capability of these cells? FIP develops when cats are exposed to mutated FCoV that acquire the capability to replicate into macrophages (Stoddart and Scott, 1989), and therefore it is conceivable that the interaction of different AGP glycoforms may elicit different macrophage reactions.",
