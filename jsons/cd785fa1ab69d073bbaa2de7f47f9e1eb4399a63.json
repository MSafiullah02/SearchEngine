Minimal symptoms are generally seen in the majority of patients and are resolved with short-term steroid administration. Since the introduction of treatment planning based on threedimensional conformal RT (3D CRT), IP risk has been significantly reduced with the application of rigorous lung constraints. With the use of modern techniques and hypofractionation, less than 2% of patients have experienced IP symptoms after a median follow-up of 15 months with ipsilateral lung V30 as the most relevant dosimetric predictor for IP risk (1, 2) . However, dose delivered to the ipsilateral lung, co-morbidities and virus infection could change the outcome of patients infected by COVID-19 during RT.",

The main comorbidities were obesity (BMI 40 kg/m 2 ), hypertension and thrombosis following surgery for knee prosthesis. The patient had right breast conservative surgery with sentinel node biopsy (SLNB). The final pathology report suggested invasive carcinoma, grade II, without lymphovascular invasion, without DCIS component, hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative. The surgical margins were clear. One of the three nodes removed was involved by macro metastasis and extracapsular extension. The PET-CT and planning CT scan did not show any abnormalities in the lung ( Figure 1A ). After Oncogeriatric evaluation, the patient received four cycles of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide combination. Adjuvant RT was planned to deliver 45Gy in 18 fractions of 2.5Gy (4 fractions a week) to the whole breast, supraclavicular and internal mammary chain, followed by a 15Gy-boost to the tumor bed. Mixed photons and electrons beams were used for nodal RT. In terms of ipsilateral lung constraints, mean ipsilateral lung dose, V20Gy and V30Gy were 18Gy, 36% and 18%, respectively ( Figure 2 ).",

Thus, it seems of paramount importance to point out the risk of severe PI during RT for breast cancer in patients who became infected by COVID-19 during the period of their treatment. High caution for indications and volume definition is recommended when RT cannot be delayed in high risk patients. In RNI cases, IMRT (which increase only low doses), breathing adaptation and prone/lateral positioning may help to reduce ipsilateral lung exposure (8, 9) . However, prone/lateral position can not allow adequate nodal coverage. Moreover, hypofractionation was reported to reduce lung dose irradiation (1). Of note, our patient had moderate hypofractionated schedule due to her age and the distance between her home and our department.",

Moreover, in early reports from China, patients with cancer who acquired COVID-19 had a higher risk for significant morbidity, including requirements for ventilatory support or death with a hazard ratio of 3.56 (7) . On the other hand, it is known that several parameters may influence incidence and severity of either radiation induced IP and COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome. For this patient, unfortunately several risk factors for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, such as age >70 years, obesity, hypertension, cancer and chemotherapy (with preexisting lymphopenia), were reported in her disease and personal history. She is still in an oxygen dependence situation with 15 liters between D10 and D24. Thus, in patients with BC undergoing RT, the utility of intervention must be weighed against the risk for inadvertent COVID-19 exposure in the health care system, especially during the initial weeks of the pandemic, when the risk for viral dissemination cannot be quantified and remains largely unknown.",

The volume definition and organ at risk sparing, such as lung, is a crucial point to discuss. Any extended lung radiation could expose BC patients to a high risk of lung damage induced by COVID-19 infection. For patients receiving chemotherapy, lymphopenia is an additional risk factor for the severe form of COVID-19 lung infection. Thus, the decision to practice extended lymph node RT in these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic must be taken on a case-by-case basis, according to the ratio between benefit and risk. ",
