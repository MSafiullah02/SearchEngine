            "text": "Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limiting acute systemic vasculitis occur mainly in infants and young children under 5 years old. Although the use of acetylsalicylic acid (AAS) in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) remains the standard therapy to KD, the etiology, genetic susceptibility genes and pathogenic factors of KD are still un-elucidated. Purpose: Current obstacles in the treatment of KD include the lack of standard clinical and genetic markers for early diagnosis, possible severe side effect of AAS (Reye's syndrome), and the refractory KD cases with resistance to IVIG therapy, therefore, this review has focused on introducing the current advances in the identification of genetic susceptibility genes, environmental factors, diagnostic markers and adjuvant pharmacological intervention for KD. Results: With an overall update in the development of KD from different aspects, our current bioinformatics data has suggested CASP3, CD40 and TLR4 as the possible pathogenic factors or diagnostic markers of KD. Besides, a list of herbal medicines which may work as the adjunct therapy for KD via targeting different proposed molecular targets of KD have also been summarized. Conclusion: With the aid of modern pharmacological research and technology, it is anticipated that novel therapeutic remedies, especially active herbal chemicals targeting precise clinical markers of KD could be developed for accurate diagnosis and treatment of the disease. (Denby et al., 2017) . Besides, KD was reported to affect many different organ systems including blood vessels, mucous membranes, skins and lymph nodes (Kuwabara et al., 2015) . With 85% of cases occur in children under 5 years old, surveys have indicated that CALs caused by KD, is gradually replacing rheumatism as the most common acquired heart disease of childhood in developed countries (Dimitriades et al., 2014) . Although the cause of KD remains unclear, effective IVIG intervention within the therapeutic window can lower the rate of CALs formation from 25% to less than 5% (Kuwabara et al., 2015) . It is",

One of the most serious sequelae of KD is the inflammation of the heart arteries which lead to the formation of aneurysm and coronary artery lesions (CALs) noteworthy that in recent years, a subtype of KD, the KD shock syndrome, were also reported for its severity and correlation to the coronary artery abnormalities and IVIG resistance (Gamez-Gonzalez et al., 2018) . Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of KD are particularly important. Although recent advances in the understanding of KD symptoms and treatments have substantially reduced the rate of complication of the disease, considerable efforts are required to characterize the causative cause, genetic and serological markers correlated to the pathogenesis, diagnosis and intervention of KD.",

Japan, Korea and Taiwan were regions on the list of highest incidence rate of KD (Singh et al., 2015) . In Japan, according to the nationwide survey conducted in 1996, the estimated incidence rate of KD was 120-150 cases per 100,000 children under 5 year old (Burns et al., 2000) . According to the 2017 KD national epidemiological survey in Japan, with an average number of 5000-6000 new cases each year, the total number of KD cases have reached 362,710 (male: 209,508 and female: 153,202) (Japan, 2017) . At 2014, the incidence of KD in Korea were 194.7 per 100,000 children under 5 year old (Kim et al., 2017a) . Although national occurrence of KD was reported in past years, seasonal peaks of KD incidence were also reported in many geographic regions (Burns et al., 2000) . For example, the peak of KD incidence occurs in January and July in Japan, while in mainland China and Taiwan, the peak of KD incidence was reached from December to January and June to July. In USA, Australia, Canada and Europe, while a higher of KD incidence rate was observed during the winter months (Ha et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2015) , no significant seasonal variation of KD was reported in Korea (Rhim et al., 2019; Rhim et al., 2014) . With an overall higher incidence rate of KD in males than in females, the male-to-female ratio was about 1.33, 1.42 and 1.62 in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, respectively (Ha et al., 2016; Lue et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2015) .",

As a general principle, continued high fever (> 39\u00b0C) lasting for at least 5 days with no response to antibiotics and antipyretics, with the development of at least 4 out of 5 listed classic diagnostic symptoms including polymorphous rash, conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, changes in oral or extremities, could be diagnosed as KD (Kuo et al., 2015b) . In addition to the assessment on clinical symptoms, laboratory diagnosis of cardiovascular damages such as chest X-ray findings, electrocardiogram changes, auscultation, aneurysm of peripheral arteries other than coronary, 2D echocardiography, angina pectoris or myocardial infarction are also important supplements for the diagnosis of KD (Ayusawa et al., 2005; Saguil et al., 2015) . Other supplementary diagnostic references such as platelets counts are also applied for the diagnosis of suspected cases of KD (Ruan et al., 2013) . In fact, the diagnostic guidelines for KD have been revised for 5 times in Japan, and with its major changes listed in Table A . Now, the 2005 diagnostic guidelines (5 th revision) are commonly used for the diagnosis of KD in Japan. With the current diagnostic guidelines set by the AHA in 2017, the diagnostic criteria in US has been revised for 3 times since 2004, and with its major changes listed in Table B . Besides, Korea, China and Europe are countries which have adopted the AHA guidelines (2017) as the reference to the diagnosis of KD. Although with standardized diagnostic criteria compiled, due to variability of clinical symptoms in different cases, discrepancies in the interpretation of clinical signs and symptoms have led to undiagnosed and unreported cases of KD (Ayusawa et al., 2005; Daniels et al., 2012) . However, recent report has suggested the evaluation on the systemic inflammatory parameters such as C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil differential, albumin and hemoglobin in the early phase of acute KD, are critical for the early diagnosis of KD (Seo et al., 2018) . Consistently, additional study has suggested the increased level of immunoglobulin and platelets in the recovery phase of KD, may indicate the degree of systemic inflammation in acute KD .",

Recent studies have also depicted various dietary factors are interlinked with the pathogenesis of KD, for example, the consumption of soy was correlated to a higher risk of KD (Portman et al., 2016) . Further pediatric research indicated that the intake of isoflavone beyond the age of conferred maternal immunity, instead of maternal-fetal transmission of isoflavones, is correlated to the higher incidence of KD in Asia than in Western countries which have relatively lower soy or isoflavone consumption (Portman, 2013) .

(iv) Infants or children with prolonged fever and cervical lymphadenitis but no response after antibiotic treatment (v) Long-term fever in infants or children after antibiotic treatment towards cellulitis in pharynx. 5) It is proposed that elevated N-terminal B-type brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP) only suggests cardiac involvement but cannot be used for KD diagnosis. 6) It is suggested that KD patients with shock are prone to IVIG resistant, coronary artery complications, mitral regurgitation, prolonged myocardial insufficiency and other clinical manifestations. Tang, et al. Phytomedicine 70 (2020) 153208 hemoglobin, platelet, serum albumin, alanine aminotransferase and urine white blood cell for the diagnosis of incomplete KD, these laboratory characteristics have implied that infection factors are closely related to KD (Saguil et al., 2015) . However, as the infectious factors of KD remains un-elucidated, classical methods such as microbial culture, microscopy and polymerase chain reaction are still not commonly applied for the diagnosis of KD. Consistent with the seasonal cycles of infectious diseases, the epidemiological characteristics and the incidence of KD were disparate in different seasons (Ha et al., 2016; Japan, 2017; Lue et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2015) . According to the available data, there were 3 large-scale national epidemic outbreaks of KD in Japan at 1979 , 1982 and 1986 , respectively (Japan, 2017 . Studies have reported the possible microbes or microbe-derived substances that may cause the pathogenesis of KD, such as rickettsia-like agent, chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, rickettsia organisms, propionibacterium acnes, leptospira spp, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, retrovirus, measles, chickenpox, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus, group A streptococcus, dengue fever virus, epstein-barr virus, coronavirus, parvovirus B19, bacillus cereus, human bocavirus, staphylococcus, staphylococcal or streptococcal superantigens Rowley et al., 2008) . A recent report by Rhim et al. has suggested a presumed etiology of KD which may be associated with the pathogens of acute pyelonephritis and exanthem subitum (Jung-Woo et al., 2019) . Furthermore, Jordan et al. reported that up to 8.8% of KD children had acquired upper respiratory tract infection simultaneously (Jordan-Villegas et al., 2010) . Therefore, the report has suggested the prescription of IVIG therapy to suspected KD children without classic clinical symptoms but with recorded respiratory viral infections. Some studies have suggested the human adenovirus (HAdV) as one of the pathogens triggering KD (Fukuda et al., 2017; Jaggi et al., 2013) . For example, Fukuda et al. reported the case of 1 monozygotic twins who have been sequentially diagnosed with KD in conjunction with HAdV-3 infection (Fukuda et al., 2017) . Jaggi et al. reported 77 cases of KD patients were diagnosed with HAdV infection by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Jaggi et al., 2013) . Although with the close correlation between various infectious factors and KD, unlike other childhood infectious diseases with known infectious factors or vaccines, the infectious agent contributing to the pathogenesis of KD remains un-characterized and more studies are required.",

            "text": "Immunological abnormalities with the development of coronary artery lesions were involved in the pathogenesis of KD. It was proposed by Lee et al. that the immunopathogenesis of KD is based on a \"protein homeostasis system\" that controls the pathogenic toxic proteins which spread and bind to endothelial cells of coronary arteries, with the involvement of non-specific T cells and non-specific antibodies to produce various cytokines contributing to endothelial cell injury . While both the innate and acquired systems are activated after pathogen infection, clinical and laboratory studies have found that the occurrence of KD is related to the activation of the innate immune system (Hara et al., 2016) . Broderick et al. reported 4 cases of KD with the reoccurrence of inflammatory clinical symptoms similar to those in \"recurrent fever syndrome\" existed in febrile disease due to the dysregulation of innate immune system (Broderick et al., 2011) . The acquired immune system has both cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity. The cell-mediated immunity activates macrophages, T cells (cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ or CD8+) and releases lymphokines. Rowley et al. showed that chronic coronary arteritis in KD continued long after the onset of the disease via upregulation of T lymphocyte and type I interferon genes . Other studies reported the increased plasma level of T helper cell type (Th) 1 cytokines (interferon-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) during the acute stage of KD (Lee et al., 2015b) , suggesting that both Th1 and Th2 cells may be activated simultaneously during the acute stage of KD. In recent years, with the research focus on identifying the key cytokines responsible for KD, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 have just been reported to play temporally roles in acute cardiac inflammation and the development of coronary vasculitis, respectively, which suggested the possible immunopathogenesis of KD (Stock et al., 2019) .",

According to the 2017 epidemiological survey in Japan, the incidence rate of KD was 2.1% and 1.2% higher in children with siblings or parents, who have been diagnosed with KD (Japan, 2017) . Besides, the incidence of KD was higher in Asian population, especially Japanese (Singh et al., 2015) , suggesting the pathogenesis of KD caused by the abnormal immune cascade triggered by infection, may be correlated to the susceptibility of genes. On account of more monozygotic twins have been diagnosed with KD, genetic studies on the susceptibility gene loci of KD have been performed by using the candidate genes or genomewide association method (GWAS) (Onouchi, 2009) .",

This approach has been used to identify SNPs in Parkinson's disease (Witoelar et al., 2017) , Crohn disease (Foo et al., 2017) , diabetes (Bush and Moore, 2012) , and heart abnormalities (Bush and Moore, 2012) . Consistently, a SNP within ITPKC gene was highly associated with the development of coronary artery abnormalities and KD (Onouchi, 2009 ). However, findings suggested that SNPs of ITPKC susceptibility in KD may vary for different ethnicities, for example, in Japan, SNP (rs28493229) in ITPKC was associated with risk of coronary artery abnormalities, while the same ITPKC SNP in Chinese was associated with susceptibility of KD . In the European population, several genes such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II delta chain, cub and sushi multiple domains 1, diacylglycerol kinase beta, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase-like 2, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14C, T-complex protein 1 subunit alpha, zinc finger homeobox 3, melanoma inhibitory activity/ras-related GTP-binding protein 4b, ITPKC (Burgner et al., 2009; Khor et al., 2011) , Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G, low-affinity II a (FCGR2A), have been identified as susceptibility genes for KD through GWAS (Khor et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Further researches have also suggested the susceptibility genes for KD are correlated to ethnicity. For example, SNPs in B lymphocyte kinase, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2, HLA class I histocompatibility antigen protein P5 and nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 14 were identified as susceptibility loci for pathogenesis of KD in Korean population (Kim et al., 2017b) . Besides, SNP located at the CRP locus (rs12068753) was found highly correlated to the CRP levels of KD patients in Korea (Kim et al., 2015) . Susceptible gene locus associated with KD such as protein pellino homolog 1 (Kim et al., 2012b) , 1p31 (Kim et al., 2011) , coatomer subunit beta, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1, immunoglobulin heavychain variable, BLK, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (Oh et al., 2008) , B. Tang, et al. Phytomedicine 70 (2020) 153208 CD40 and FCGR2A (Kwon et al., 2017) (Table D) were identified in the Asian population (Onouchi, 2012) . In addition, genetic variants in FCGR2A or CD40 have also been depicted in KD patients of different nationalities including Chinese (Ji et al., 2013) , European , Korean, Australian and New Zealander (Khor et al., 2011) . Of note, SNPs (rs4810485 and rs1535045) within CD40 gene were associated with the development of KD in Taiwanese children (Kuo et al., 2012) . Although literature has reported the possible genetic role of FCGR2A alleles for the pathophysiology of KD in Chinese children , other studies reported that there is no correlation between the SNP (rs1801274) of FCGR2A gene and the incident of KD in patients of Greeks origin (Chatzikyriakidou et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2013) . In Japan, while the number of CC chemokine ligand 3-like 1 gene copies is highly associated with the occurrence of KD and IVIG resistance, there were no correlation to the pathogenesis of KD in Korean patients (Kim et al., 2012a) , suggesting the susceptibility genes for KD may be specific to ethnicity according to the results of GWAS. Although the discrepancy between ethnicity was not well-defined, with the importance of CALs and IVIG resistance in the pathogenesis of KD, potassium intermediate/small conductance calcium-activated channel was identified as a susceptibility locus for the development of CALs in KD (Kim et al., 2013) . In addition, SNP (rs1801274) on FCGR2A is also one of the factors influencing the curative effect of IVIG on KD (Ji et al., 2013) . Kuo et al. (2015a,b) reported that hypomethylation of FCGR2A is correlated to KD and resistance to IVIG (Kuo et al., 2015a) , suggesting the possible role of susceptibility genes in the development of CAL or IVIG resistance.",

Among them, 25 KD related pathways and 229 KD related genes were sorted out and interpreted by the functional annotation tool in the bioinformatics resource \"Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery\" (DAVID), STRING and Uniprot, for the discovery of the enriched functional-related gene groups (Huang et al., 2009) . The data collected from DAVID functional annotation clustering were then input to software cytoscape enrichment plugin, with a genetic network summarized in Fig. A . According to the enrichment score of DAVID, 3 genes including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), caspase (CASP)-3 and CD40 are identified as the most enriched genes for KD. Firstly, TLR4 is one of toll-like receptors which level was found upregulated on peripheral blood mononuclear/macrophage cells in acute KD patients when compared to healthy children of the same age (Wang et al., 2008) . Together with the elevated expression of related molecules myeloid differentiation protein-2 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), it was suggested that abnormal activation of TLR4 may be one of the initiating factors leading to immune dysfunction in KD patients, which also involved the activation of the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and its downstream pathway with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 (Wang et al., 2008) .",

Besides, other than its basic role in triggering apoptosis, the interaction of CASP3 with the T cell receptor, was correlated to the increased transcription of CASP3 and activation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells signaling pathway, accompanied by the increased level of cytokines such as IL-2 Wu et al., 2006) . With the fact that there are different protein substrates for CASP3, therefore, further investigation on the immuno-regulatory role of CASP3 in the pathogenesis of KD is highly desired. Literature has also showed that the expression level of CD40 was significantly higher in both acute KD and KD with coronary artery lesion groups, suggesting the possible immunological role of CD40 in the pathogenesis of KD, which may be modulated through the MyD88-independent-Toll-like receptor 4 transduction pathway .

About 10-20% of KD patients were reported as not responsive to the treatment of IVIG and high-dose AAS, and with a higher risk of developing coronary heart disease complications (Singer et al., 2008) . Some reports have suggested several biomarkers and genetic polymorphisms can be applied to predict resistance to IVIG such as clusterin (Ou-Yang et al., 2013) , IL-6 (Sato et al., 2013) , IL-10 (Wang et al., 2013) , IL-17 (Jia et al., 2010) , TNF-\u03b1 , and CD4 + CD25 + forkhead box P3 regulatory T cells (Jia et al., 2010) . Some laboratory indicators are also important for the prediction of IVIG responsiveness, for example, age, sex, number of illness days, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, aspartate aminotransferase, hemoglobin concentration, CRP, eosinophil, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (Kuo et al., 2007; Sleeper et al., 2011) , cholesterol (Hwang et al., 2011) , serum albumin , percentage of neutrophils, and serum sodium level (Moon et al., 2016) . Although there are still no definite treatments for KD patients with IVIG resistance, steroid such as prednisolone was reported to reduce the incidence of coronary abnormalities (Miyata et al., 2018) . Infliximab (Son et al., 2011) , methotrexate and plasma exchange (Hokosaki et al., 2012) have also been reported to benefit KD patients with initial IVIG treatment failure. Among them, infliximab was reported to process good adjuvant efficacy for KD patients with IVIG resistance by reducing duration of fever, improving IVIG reaction rate and level of specific inflammatory marker. This observation is consistent with the results of several independent clinical trials in different countries. For example, in Japan, the use of infliximab was correlated with the level of several transcripts associated with IVIG resistance factors and inflammation signaling pathways of KD such as peptidase inhibitor-3, matrix metalloproteinase-8, chemokine receptor-2 and pentamer-3 (Ogihara et al., 2014) . In Korea, retrospective analysis of 16 patients with refractory KD indicated that infliximab can also be used to prevent the progression of CAL in the refractory KD (Song et al., 2010) .",

RS occurs during the treatment of fever with drugs containing AAS, and is usually preceded by a viral infection, especially influenza and chickenpox, in children and teenagers, leading to possible lethal side effects such as toxic encephalopathy or liver dysfunction (Chornomydz et al., 2017) . The surveillance of RS was first started in the U.S. at early 1970s and has led to the restricted use of AAS in children nowadays (Chapman and Arnold, 2020) . Besides, according to the AHA diagnostic guidelines of KD (2017), KD patients who have been prescribed with high dose of AAS treatment are at the possible risk of getting RS, and therefore replacing the AAS with another antiplatelet drug is recommended (McCrindle et al., 2017) . In Japan (Nejihashi et al., 1980) , Taiwan (Wei et al., 2005) , Hong Kong (Su et al., 2018) and the United States (Belay et al., 1999) , although only occasional RS cases were reported, finding an alternative anti-inflammatory drug or herbal compounds that replaces AAS is desirable.",

For example, resveratrol from Vitis vinifera L. (fruit) possesses anti-inflammatory effects on human coronary arterial endothelial cells via decreasing the level of TNF-\u03b1-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase and IL-1\u03b2 and autophagy . Besides, low dose of resveratrol could protect against experimental induced RS partially via inhibition of oxidative stress and restoration of complex I activity (Abdin and Sarhan, 2014) . Based on the above observation, natural product may work as a possible supplement for applying with AAS in infants and young children to reduce the risk of RS or other side effect. On the other hand, triptolide from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f (root) could reduce the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in endothelial cells and increase the rate of apoptosis of inflammatory cells in a mouse model of KD (Yan and Zou, 2013) , suggesting triptolide may be an alternative or adjuvant anti-inflammatory agent for treating KD. According to the results of 2 independent clinical studies conducted in mainland China, the treatment of ligustrazine (an alkaloid extracted from rhizome of Ligusticum striatum DC) in combination with standard KD therapy using AAS, IVIG and anti-blood clot medicine dipyridamole, showed a significantly better improvement in relieving symptoms of increased body temperatures and coronary artery dilation, when compared to the treatment group of Western medicine alone (Luo, 2010; Neng et al., 1996) . Tanshinone II-A, a natural compound extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (root), was also applied in combination with AAS and IVIG to treat KD. This clinical study confirmed that co-treatment of tanshinone II-A with IVIG and AAS can shorten the time of fever, reduced the level of CRP and facilitated the faster recovery of coronary artery damage when compared to standard IVIG and AAS treatment alone (Zhang et al., 2011) .",

For example, by interlinking the genetic susceptibility of KD to the traditional clinical applications and modern pharmacological actions of selected natural products, a list of potential herbal candidates for treating KD was proposed as shown in Table F . By targeting the 3 potential KD genes such as TLR4, CASP3 and CD40, several potential effective single components derived from natural plants are suggested. For example, kaempferol derived from Kaempferia galanga L. may work as a novel therapeutic agent for KD via decreasing the expression level of CD40 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells (Medeiros et al., 2009) . Quercetin derived from Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertn or oaks species can decrease the level of CD40 in cervical carcinoma cells and facilitate cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses (Hill et al., 2005) . Similarly, emodin derived from Rheum rhabarbarum L., Rhamnus dahurica Pall (bark), and Reynoutria japonica Houtt (rhizome and root) may also be used for treating KD via its ability in decreasing both CASP3 and TNF-\u03b1 level, and inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation (Wu et al., 2007) . For targeting TLR4 gene, several natural compounds are suggested for future investigation. For example, cryptotanshinone derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge can decrease the expression of TLR4 in Caco-2 cells stimulated by LPS, suggesting that cryptotanshinone may possess antiinflammatory property via inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and decreased expression of TLR4. Zerumbone derived from Zingiber zerumbet (L.) Smith (rhizome) is a monocyclic sesquiterpenoid, which can B . Tang, et al. Phytomedicine 70 (2020) 153208 reduce the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and decrease the upregulated protein level of TLR4 and NF-\u03baB p-p65 for possessing the anti-inflammatory activities . Leng et al. showed that astragaloside IV derived from Astragalus propinquus Schischkin (root) can decrease the expression of TLR4 and NF-\u03baB p65 both in vivo and in vitro, and significantly improved the aortic endothelial function (Leng et al., 2018) , suggesting the potential use of herbal chemicals for treating KD.",

With the increasing number of cases in KD, the clinical diagnostic guidelines are constantly being updated to classify different types of KD. Although literatures have attributed the pathogenesis of KD to different factors such as regional and ethnic disparities, dietary and environmental factors, infectious agents, immuoregulatory and inflammatory responses, or genetic susceptibility, there is still a lack of a conclusive or integrative summary to confirm the etiology of KD. In fact, KD is classified as a self-limiting acute childhood disease, which is nowadays considered as one of the possible causative reasons for the development of coronary artery disease in adult, therefore, early diagnosis by using high-end technology or identification of specific clinical KD markers deserve our further elucidation. KD is most commonly considered as an immune disease, however, via candidate genes and genome-wide association studies of KD, various genetic factors related to both immune and inflammatory system, which finally contributed to disease susceptibility were discovered. Through bioinformatics analysis, our current study has identified 3 most enriched genes including TLR4, CASP3 and CD40, which are highly correlated to the pathophysiology of KD.",

Besides, the possible risk of getting RS after prescription of AAS in children also worth our further identification of adjuvant therapy for KD. In this review, the use of herbal therapy as adjuvant therapy for KD were therefore proposed. While some of the herbal decoctions were suggested for prescription due to their traditional usage in treating KD, herbal chemicals which targeting not only on the immune and inflammatory system, but also the susceptibility genes to KD, were also recommended for further pharmacological or clinical evaluation. With the more advanced technology in modern pharmacological research, it is anticipated that novel therapeutic remedies targeting specific clinical markers of KD could be developed for accurate diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
