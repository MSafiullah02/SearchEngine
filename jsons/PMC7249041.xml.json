            "text": "Extracellular vesicles are membrane-enclosed nanoscale particles released from essentially all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that carry proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA. They can deliver information between cells through the extracellular space, with strong evidence for functional activity provided by their phenotypic effects on recipient cells. Cargo RNAs of extracellular vesicles include various biotypes that represent a selected portion of the RNA content of the source cell, with a strong bias towards small non-coding RNAs, although fragmented and intact mRNA, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) molecules can be found. Ample evidence supports the ability of RNAs enclosed in extracellular vesicles to impact the functional properties of cells that take them up (Table 1). For example, extracellular vesicles in plasma promote repair of cardiac cells1, vesicles released by astrocytes contribute to neurodegeneration2 and tumour-derived vesicles create a favourable microenvironment for cancer progression3 and metastases4. However, given that the functions of many non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are incompletely understood and that delivery of any given extracellular vesicle-associated RNA is accompanied by delivery of multiple other biomolecules, the complex language of extracellular vesicle-mediated communication remains to be deciphered. Moreover, the cellular mechanisms involved in the trafficking and fate of extracellular RNAs (exRNAs), including the possibility of packaging different RNA sequences into different types of extracellular vesicles, differential uptake into specific recipient cell types and fate on uptake are still being elucidated (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "The RNA contained in extracellular vesicles reflects the type and the physiological/pathological state of the source cells, but differs substantially from the cellular RNA content, in terms of both the types of RNA and the relative concentrations of specific RNA sequences. The extracellular vesicle populations carried in biofluids, tissues and conditioned medium from cultured cells are heterogeneous with respect to size, morphology and composition. Four major subclasses of extracellular vesicles appear to arise from distinct biogenesis pathways and can be distinguished roughly in the basis of size: exosomes (50\u2013150 nm), microvesicles (100\u20131,000 nm), large oncosomes (1,000\u201310,000 nm) and apoptotic bodies (100\u20135,000 nm), but are difficult to distinguish from high-density and low-density lipoproteins, chylomicrons, protein aggregates and cell debris5. Guidelines for standardization of terminology, methods and reporting are being developed to improve experimental reproducibility across studies6,7. The size of most extracellular vesicles (which also limits the number of cargo molecules/vesicles) places them below the resolution and sensitivity thresholds of standard light microscopy and fluorescence-activated sorting techniques. Overlap in the sizes and other biophysical properties among different extracellular vesicle subclasses and lack of known unique markers for each subclass8,9 have made it difficult to define the cargo (including RNAs) of different subclasses with confidence5. Technical factors, including the use of different methods for isolation of extracellular vesicles and their RNA, can strongly influence RNA profiling results (see, for example, refs10\u201316). Separation of RNA in vesicles from RNAs associated with other exRNA carriers, including lipoproteins17 and ribonucleoproteins18, is also challenging (see refs5,6,10,17,18 and the exRNA Atlas11). A variety of approaches have been used to address these concerns, including culture of cells in serum-free medium (to avoid contamination with serum-derived extracellular vesicles) and separation of extracellular vesicle subclasses and other exRNA carriers by high-resolution density gradient centrifugation10, size-exclusion chromatography19, asymmetric field-flow fractionation20,21 and immunoaffinity purification9.",

Initial studies reported that extracellular vesicles contained mRNAs and mature miRNA sequences, as well as ncRNAs, with a peak size of 200 nucleotides, but extending out to 5 kb or more23\u201325. Since then, more comprehensive studies have found the majority of known ncRNA biotypes, including small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), rRNAs, lncRNAs, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), mitochondrial RNAs, Y RNAs and vault RNAs (vtRNAs)26\u201328. miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) have also been reported in tumour microvesicles, along with the RNA interference processing machinery components Dicer and Argonaute29\u201331. However, the methods used in these studies did not separate extracellular vesicles from free ribonucleoproteins16 or lipoproteins32. Moreover, among the many studies using proteomic methods to analyse the composition of extracellular vesicles, only one has reported the presence of Argonaute 2 (AGO2)33, and none has detected Dicer. One study that used density gradient ultracentrifugation to isolate extracellular vesicles from cell culture supernatant of cancer cells did convincingly demonstrate that overexpression of the KRAS oncogene promotes sorting of AGO2-associated miRNAs into extracellular vesicles34. Thus, whether pre-miRNAs and their processing machinery are transferred via extracellular vesicles in normal cells remains to be established. Finally, extracellular vesicle-associated circular RNAs have also been detected by use of specific data analysis pipelines that can identify back-spliced transcripts35\u201340.",

            "text": "Biogenesis of extracellular vesicles is relatively well studied, and several modes and molecular components that drive the process have been established5,53 (Fig. 2). Exosomes are generated by invagination of the endosomal membrane forming intraluminal vesicles within multivesicular bodies (MVBs). This process involves participation of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport, as well as RAB27A/RAB27B, tumour susceptibility gene 101 protein (TSG101), ALIX, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4 (VPS4)5 and lipid microdomains (lipid rafts)54. When MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane, the intraluminal vesicles are released into the extracellular space as exosomes. Exosome release relies on the cytoskeleton, such that MVBs are transported to the plasma membrane via microtubules55, where branched actin, polymerized by Arp2/3 and stabilized by the actin-binding protein cortactin, supports their docking56. Microvesicles bud out from the plasma membrane directly and share many of the same proteins involved in exosome biogenesis5,20, which makes it challenging to experimentally dissect and manipulate the different extracellular vesicle carriers. In addition to these two basic modes of extracellular vesicle biogenesis, oncosomes form by blebbing off the plasma membrane of tumour cells. These extracellular vesicles are usually larger than microvesicles and are typically associated with cell motility57\u201360. Release of oncosomes involves recruitment of the actin-bundling protein fascin, which together with the actin\u2013plasma membrane crosslinker ezrin and the cell-surface glycoprotein podocalyxin promotes extrusion and scission of the plasma membrane29. Other large extracellular vesicles, overlapping in size with oncosomes, form during apoptotic cell death when plasma membrane blebs and spike-like protrusions from the plasma membrane (microtubule spikes) break off during apoptosis (forming apoptopodia)5,60. Finally, some extracellular vesicles can be generated with the engagement of proteins of viral origin, such as retroviral-like Gag proteins on the inner plasma membrane that bind RNA and bud off from the cell membrane as virus-like particles.",

Two RBPs, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK) and scaffold-attachment factor B1 (SAFB), regulate the small non-coding RNA composition of extracellular vesicles via secretory autophagy84. Different RBPs display binding preferences for different RNA sequence motifs, but a full understanding of these binding interactions has yet to be established (see, for example, refs71,76,80,85\u201387). Other extracellular vesicle sorting signals may include RNA and/or RBP modifications, such as ubiquitylation, sumoylation, phosphorylation and uridylation, which also impact RNA splicing, stability and translation and miRNA biogenesis88. Exosome biogenesis and miRNA-mediated gene silencing may be functionally linked89,90. The small GTPase ARF6 appears to be involved in targeting of pre-miRNAs to oncosomes along with miRNA processing machinery29. Thus, many mechanisms can influence packaging of RNAs into extracellular vesicles, but the extent to which these mechanisms are specific to selected RNA species and how RNA cargo loading is regulated by the cells remain elusive.",

Uptake of extracellular vesicles can be both selective and non-specific5,53. For example, extracellular vesicles from tumour cells may home to different tissues by virtue of the expression of specific integrins on their surface53, thereby setting up a tissue-specific niche for incoming metastatic tumour cells4. Once they are in contact with recipient cells, multiple routes of extracellular vesicle uptake have been reported, including clathrin/caveolin-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, lipid raft-mediated uptake or direct membrane fusion92 (Fig. 3). There are also reports of direct cell-to-cell extracellular vesicle transfer via tunnelling nanotubes for RNA delivery93\u201395. The current focus of extracellular vesicle uptake is on endocytic pathways, which may result in part from the difficulty in assessing fusion events. Extracellular vesicles may also remain bound to cell surfaces without internalization (Fig. 3), engaging in cell signalling and antigen presentation53. It is currently unknown whether cells control the interaction and uptake of extracellular vesicles depending on their subtype and/or physiological state.",

Uptake of extracellular vesicles can be promoted at the cell surface. For example, binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the plasma membrane increased uptake of tumour-derived extracellular vesicles via endocytosis96,97, and specific integrin receptors can drive selective uptake of extracellular vesicles by certain primary tumours98. Uptake of extracellular vesicles was also promoted by the interaction of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 4 (TIM4) molecules with phosphatidylserine present on extracellular vesicle membranes99. Accordingly, these different types of molecules could be engineered on the surface of extracellular vesicles to promote their uptake99.",

Indeed, it has been demonstrated that despite successful uptake, generation of functional protein from extracellular vesicle-derived mRNA in recipient cells was negligible, suggesting that endosomal escape is critical to RNA function101. It is possible that extracellular vesicles might naturally incorporate some mechanisms for endosomal escape, which so far remain unknown. Nevertheless, establishing reliable means of increasing the efficiency of extracellular vesicle cargo escape from the endosomal compartment will likely be essential to widen the application potential of extracellular vesicles (see also later).",

In other examples in the nervous system, neurons produce miR-124a-loaded extracellular vesicles that regulate the glutamate transporter in astrocytes, which is important for synaptic transmission108. In the context of brain cancer, astrocytes secrete extracellular vesicles with miR-19, which inhibits an important tumour suppressor, PTEN, in cancer cells, thereby promoting growth of brain metastases109. As another example, extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells enriched in miR-375 via its overexpression stimulated bone regeneration by bone marrow stem cells110. Two critical miRNAs that regulate inflammation, miR-155 and miR-146a, are exchanged between dendritic cells in vivo, with the latter inhibiting and the former promoting endotoxin-induced inflammation in mice111. Other recent examples of transfer of functional miRNAs by extracellular vesicles from cancer, cardiac, neural, immune and adipose cells are summarized in Table 1.",

Exit from the endosome could be a bottleneck in functional mRNA delivery101 and may depend on the donor and/or recipient cell types. However, active translation of mRNAs transported by extracellular vesicles into recipient cells was reported early on; for example, expression of reporter proteins from mRNA transferred by extracellular vesicles between mast cells23 and from glioblastoma to endothelial cells24. In one study mRNAs transported within extracellular vesicles were translated within 1 hour after extracellular vesicle uptake during bidirectional exchange in co-cultures of glioblastoma and HEK293T cells114. There is also evidence that extracellular vesicle mRNA can generate active proteins, as transfer of Cre recombinase mRNA in extracellular vesicles led to recombination events in the brains of floxed reporter mice115,116. Of note, this study analysed the extracellular vesicles for Cre mRNA and protein, and while the former was detected by reverse transcription\u2013PCR, the latter was not detected by western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. But because reverse transcription\u2013PCR is markedly more sensitive than either of the last two protein detection techniques, the contribution of the extracellular vesicle-mediated protein transfer of Cre to this functional effect cannot be ruled out. Extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer of mRNAs between human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (stimulated by transforming growth factor-\u03b2) and arterial endothelial cells has also been demonstrated with a number of different mRNAs present in these extracellular vesicles, prominently including regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix remodelling117. Because transforming growth factor-\u03b2 is a cytokine relevant for the pathology of pulmonary arterial hypertension, this extracellular vesicle-mediated communication could be involved in the disease phenotype117.",

Specific tRNA fragments derived from the same tRNA are sorted into extracellular vesicles, while others are not. The tRNA fragment content of extracellular vesicles appears to be dependent on the source cell state, as for T cell activation, which results in changes in the types of tRNA fragments incorporated into extracellular vesicles, with some fragments showing activation-dependent sorting into extracellular vesicles47. Silencing of these activation-dependent tRNA fragments promoted T cell activation, suggesting that in this case, secretion of tRNA fragments is a means of removing them from the cell, thereby preventing repression of immune responses47.

            "text": "In addition to their more specific functions, extracellular vesicle-associated ncRNAs can also produce effects via direct interactions with cytoplasmic receptors, in particular immune receptors, such as RIG-I-like receptors, which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and the NOD-like receptor family, which in addition to PAMPs also recognizes endogenously derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Most of what we know about how exRNA triggers these cytoplasmic receptors has been revealed for extracellular vesicles carrying microbial content130. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA is packed into extracellular vesicles released from infected macrophages that are subsequently taken up by other macrophages. This triggers the RIG-I RNA sensing pathway leading to production of type I interferon and accelerated maturation of bacteria-containing phagosomes by recipient macrophages, supporting increased bacterial killing131. A similar mechanism is used during latent infection with Epstein\u2013Barr virus, whereby infected B cells release extracellular vesicles containing viral ncRNAs with the potential to stimulate RIG-I and other related PAMP receptors. These extracellular vesicles act on dendritic cells and stimulate antiviral responses132. There are also hints in the literature that some mammalian RNAs are able to trigger these receptor-mediated pathways. For example, cancer stromal fibroblasts increase the expression of RN7SL1 \u2014 an endogenous 5\u2032-triphosphorylated RNA (representing a canonical target for RIG-I) \u2014 which is normally shielded by binding to its RBP. This increased expression results in unshielded RN7SL1, which is packaged into extracellular vesicles and when delivered to breast cancer cells induces RIG-I signalling and interferon-stimulated gene expression, resulting in cancer promotion133 and therapy resistance134. However, it is worth noting that in addition to these signalling responses to exRNA, any exogenous RNA may be perceived as \u2018foreign\u2019 by the recipient cell, leading to RIG-mediated degradation135. In addition to proactive effects of RIG-I signalling in infection and cancer, recognition of exRNA by immune receptors can also lead to pathological inflammation and rejection of recipient cells by the activation of the immune system.",

These exRNAs can potentially trigger Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and thereby elicit an innate immune response106. The most likely TLRs for this task are TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, which are intrinsically capable of sensing PAMPs and DAMPs and operate within the endosomal compartment during its maturation and acidification138. If the lipid layer of extracellular vesicles surrounding the cargo is breached after endocytosis, the RNA cargo could be exposed inside the endosome. As such, TLRs in the endosome of the recipient cells could be triggered by recognizing this single-stranded RNA cargo. This has been demonstrated for miR-21 and miR-29a, which are secreted by lung cancer cells within extracellular vesicles, which are then taken up by surrounding immune cells in vivo and activate endosomal TLR7 and TLR8, thereby inducing a proinflammatory phenotype that supports cancer progression139. Similarly, members of the let-7 miRNA family (let-7a and let-7e) in extracellular vesicles140,141 harbour a specific GU-rich motif (GUUGUGU) that binds to and activates TLR7. TLR7 activation could, in turn, impact cell function in disease-relevant contexts, including neurodegeneration142 and cancer143.",

The yield of RNA-loaded extracellular vesicles can be further increased by mechanical extrusion of vesicles through a micrometre-pore-sized filter using cells that express high levels of the desired mRNA158. RNA enrichment can also be achieved by having the donor cells express a protein that both interacts with the plasma membrane (for example, via different lipid anchors)159 or a viral envelope protein (such as vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein)101 and has an RNA-binding motif, typically of viral origin (for example, the RNA-binding peptide from the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein)160. In concert, the cargo RNA is equipped with specific sequences recognized by the RNA-binding motif in the protein, allowing targeting of the RNA of interest to the plasma membrane and facilitating its release through budding from the plasma membrane, mimicking retrovirus-like particle release159 (Fig. 2). It is also possible to target RNAs to MVBs, by expressing protein fusions that couple an MVB-enriched protein (such as lysosome-associated membrane protein 2, tetraspanin or CD63) with an RNA-binding motif101,161. One approach for selective enrichment in extracellular vesicles took advantage of a specific subpopulation of microvesicles, referred to as \u2018arrestin domain-containing protein 1 (ARRDC1)-mediated microvesicles\u2019. In this approach, ARRDC1 and RNA cargo were engineered to interact \u2014 via including the transactivator of transcription (Tat) peptide from HIV in ARRDC1 and its RNA binding-motif, transactivating response (TAR) element, in the RNA \u2014 allowing efficient generation of RNA cargo-loaded extracellular vesicles. This strategy was successful in transfer of p53 mRNA, which was translated in recipient cells on uptake (including in vivo delivery into mice)162. Beyond the use of viral components, other approaches have included incorporation of \u2018zipcode\u2019 sequences, typically in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the cargo RNA, which can be recognized by specific RBPs associated with membrane-targeted or MVB-targeted proteins (see, for example, refs85,161). Taking advantage of the lipid biocomposition of extracellular vesicles can also help in loading RNA\u2013RBP complexes into them, by engineering RBPs to bind to extracellular vesicle membranes more efficiently via addition of specific peptides. The different lipids in extracellular vesicles make possible binding with curvature-sensing and lipid composition-specific affinity peptides. Annexin A5 is a well-known example that binds to negative curvature-specific lipid phosphatidylserine on apoptotic bodies and extracellular vesicles, while the effective domain (residues 151\u2013175) of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein has an affinity for positive-curvature-associated lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate that is present on plasma membrane-derived vesicles163. Some other proteins, such as bradykinin, can also harbour peptides that bind highly curved membranes164. Other options include incorporation of binding domains of proteins with affinity for intracellular membranes, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate159.",

One of the most promising approaches uses chemically stabilized siRNAs bearing a lipophilic moiety, such as cholesterol, which results in high incorporation onto and through the lipid membrane of the extracellular vesicles with documented functional knockdown of target mRNA in vivo171,172. Still, it is important to keep in mind that isolated extracellular vesicles are inherently already \u2018full\u2019 of RNA and proteins, and it is not clear how much more additional cargo can be effectively loaded into them. Nevertheless, the lipid membrane may be extendable, and stabilized siRNAs can be loaded on both the inside and the outside, thereby supporting these in vitro loading strategies. In considering different modes of loading of RNA into isolated extracellular vesicles, one should also keep in mind the integrity of the vesicles and potential antigenic/toxic components included in the loading process, which may limit successive administrations of exogenously loaded vesicles.",

            "text": "In addition to cargo loading, to ensure efficient cell\u2013cell communication (especially in a therapeutic setting), it is key to ensure high yields of high-quality extracellular vesicle production173. Generally, obtaining large amounts of pure extracellular vesicle preparations necessitates copious starting material, and enhancing the production of extracellular vesicles is a current focus of many researchers and biotechnology companies. Increasing extracellular vesicle biogenesis in the donor cell is one strategy to increase the overall availability of extracellular vesicle RNA. One possibility is to overexpress regulatory proteins involved in extracellular vesicle biogenesis. A screen with a readout for the numbers of extracellular vesicles released identified factors in the donor cell that promoted exosome biogenesis, including STEAP3 (involved in exosome biogenesis), syndecan 4 (MVB formation) and an increase in the citric acid cycle to boost production of RNA cargo-loaded exosomes161. In another study, overexpression of the actin-bundling protein cortactin to increase MVB docking at the plasma membrane (see Fig. 2) proved efficient in increasing exosome release56. Treatment of source cells with different compounds, such as bafilomycin A1 (a V-ATPase inhibitor174) or heparanase175, which regulates secretion, composition and function of tumour cell-derived exosomes, also increased production of extracellular vesicles. Extracellular vesicle secretion was also increased by elevated levels of intracellular Ca2+ in response to treatment with monesin, a Na+/H+ exchanger176. Natural compounds can influence extracellular vesicle release; for example, microglia exposed to serotonin exhibited increased fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane, via increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration177. Radiation, hypoxia, oxidative stress and low pH can all upregulate extracellular vesicle production178\u2013181. Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein also promotes extracellular vesicle release182,183. Finally, the yield of isolated extracellular vesicles can be increased by in vitro fusion with synthetic lipids, followed by extrusion though small pores (100\u2013400 nm in diameter184). These vesicles could then be loaded with cargo (siRNA) via electroporation and were successfully taken up by recipient cells in culture at a rate that was more than tenfold higher than that of native vesicles184.",

In an early attempt to route extracellular vesicles to the brain after intravenous delivery, a peptide from rabies virus glycoprotein that targets acetylcholine receptor-expressing cells in the brain was fused to lysosome-associated membrane protein 2B (which associates with MVBs)165, but its effectiveness differs in different studies. Extracellular vesicles have also been engineered to display a nanobody to the epidermal growth factor receptor on their surface to target tumour cells expressing this receptor194. Tissue-targeting ligands can also be linked to the phosphatidylserine-binding domain of lactadherin, which is exposed on the surface of extracellular vesicles195. In yet another approach, a single-chain variable fragment of an anti-HIV monoclonal antibody was incorporated into an expression vector designed to target recombinant proteins to the surface of mammalian cells to deliver apoptosis-inducing miR-143 (or the drug curcumin) to kill HIV-infected cells196. Finally, a high-throughput screening method (phage display) was used to identify a peptide, CP05, that binds to an extracellular domain of tetraspanin CD63 (ref.197). By linking muscle-targeting peptides and antisense oligonucleotides to CP05, efficient delivery of these antisense RNAs to skeletal muscle in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy was achieved197. As an alternative strategy to incorporation of targeting ligands directly in the extracellular vesicle membrane, it is also possible to incorporate artificial lipids into extracellular vesicle membranes, where they can aid in coupling of tissue-targeting antibodies or homing peptides with the extracellular vesicle surface and thus influence the biodistribution of therapeutic extracellular vesicles198.",

In this regard, a bacteriophage \u03a629 RNA, which has a three-way junction allowing its self-association, has been engineered to incorporate a membrane-targeting cholesterol moiety, a prostate-specific membrane antigen or RNA aptamer, and an epidermal growth factor receptor RNA aptamer199. This RNA trimer composite incorporated itself spontaneously into membranes of extracellular vesicles ex vivo. These decorated extracellular vesicles could then be loaded with RNA cargo (such as anticancer siRNAs) to inhibit tumour growth in mouse models. Cancer cell-targeting aptamers were also successfully conjugated to a hydrophobic diacyl lipid tail and incorporated in extracellular vesicle membranes following their loading with anticancer drugs200. Extracellular vesicle functionalization has also been performed chemically (via reaction between aptamer-conjugated aldehyde and the amino group of membrane proteins incorporated into extracellular vesicles), whereby extracellular vesicles from bone marrow stromal cells were equipped with a bone marrow-specific RNA aptamer201. These functionalized extracellular vesicles were then efficiently targeted to the bone marrow after intravenous injection in mice and promoted bone regeneration. By contrast, non-functionalized extracellular vesicles primarily accumulated in the liver and lungs and did not have beneficial effects on bone regeneration201.",

Direct fusion of the extracellular vesicles with the plasma membrane can be achieved by incorporating fusion proteins, such as syncytin 1, syncytin 2 and epithelial fusion failure 1 protein210, into their membranes. Furthermore, the gap junction protein connexin 43 is present in the extracellular vesicle membrane and can create a channel in the plasma membrane that allows passage of oligonucleotides into the cytosol211. On the basis of the similarity between extracellular vesicles and viral particles, incorporation of viral proteins, such as vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein183, into extracellular vesicles is an appealing strategy to target extracellular vesicles to specific cell types and organs while also improving functional delivery of RNA, albeit at the risk of introducing antigenic proteins113,212. For escape from the endosomal pathway, ideas can be sought from bacteria and viruses. Some enveloped and non-enveloped viruses (for example, adeno-associated virus and influenza virus) are taken up by endocytosis and through pH-sensitive fusion proteins use the acidic pH of the endosomal compartment to promote membrane fusion between the endosomal and vesicular membranes213\u2013215. Many species of pathogenic bacteria produce pore-forming toxins to escape from the degradative route following their uptake into host cell endosomes216\u2013218. Such proteins could be engineered into extracellular vesicle membranes. Addition of compounds such as chloroquine that block acidification of the endosomal compartment and release of viruses paradoxically enhanced extravesicular delivery in one of the studies, possibly through a protein sponge effect leading to swelling and bursting of the endosomes219. Other compound found to increase endosomal escape was small molecule UNC10217832A219.",

An advantage of using extracellular vesicle-derived RNAs as biomarkers is that they are protected from degradation by RNases and thus are quite stable, and that the vesicles display on their surface the antigenic markers of the cells from which they were derived, allowing enrichment of vesicles from a particular tissue source (for example, using antibody capture for the enrichment of tumour-derived vesicles in serum224). Many new sensitive technologies, such as Droplet Digital reverse transcription\u2013PCR are being used to enhance detection of specific RNA species in extracellular vesicles225.",

The first example using extracellular vesicles in biofluids was the detection of a tumour-specific mRNA: mutant epidermal growth factor receptor in serum of patients with glioblastoma24. In other examples, elevated levels of specific miRNAs have been found in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with glioblastoma226, patients with Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease227, and patients with breast cancer228. Changes in levels of mRNA splice variants are detected in urine from patients with myotonic dystrophy229. lncRNA profiles in blood samples from patients with type 2 diabetes correlate with heart functions230. This biomarker application of extracellular vesicles has already been successfully translated into the clinical setting. Currently, mutated mRNAs in extracellular vesicles and other carriers in plasma are being used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of haematological disorders231 (for example, NeoLAB liquid biopsy from NeoGenomics Laboratories) and for prognostic assessment of prostate, lung and other solid tumours232,233 (for example, ExoDx prostate test from Bio-Techne).",

            "text": "There is tremendous interest in using extracellular vesicles as vehicles to deliver RNA therapeutics. Extracellular vesicles as therapeutic carriers have several advantages: they can be obtained from a variety of sources, including the patient\u2019s own extracellular vesicles (in which case they would be immune neutral); they protect the cargo within a lipid bilayer; they provide a membrane platform for displaying ligands; and they can carry not only RNA but also other therapeutic agents at the same time. At the present time, these applications are still limited by the inherent heterogeneity of extracellular vesicles and the inability to achieve a fully characterized pure extracellular vesicle population. Extracellular vesicle preparations being used for preclinical trials are more appropriately referred to as \u2018secretomes\u2019 as they contain a mixture of extracellular elements234,235. Despite these limitations, therapeutic RNA delivery via extracellular vesicles has already entered clinical investigations (see ref.150 for a review). Preclinical studies have shown that unmodified mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles are distributed broadly after intravenous injection236,237 and can ameliorate the effects of various diseases in the liver, brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, skeletal muscle and immune system238. There are now also strategies in place to obtain extracellular vesicles in considerable amounts from various sources, such as commonly used cells that can be expanded on a large scale (for example, mesenchymal stem cells172,239, red blood cells240 and HEK293 cells241), biofluids that are readily available in large volumes (for example, bovine milk242 and human plasma167) and even plant materials (for example, grapefruit243 and ginger167). Vesicles and therapeutic agents generated from plants and other food items have the advantage that they fall into the category of natural substances and as such are not under the strict guidelines of the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials244. Furthermore, as discussed earlier, extracellular vesicles can be further modified to be loaded with cargo, generating \u2018designer\u2019 vesicles with increased production, cargo loading and/or targeting for improved therapeutic outcome.",

            "text": "Five basic variations on the theme of using extracellular vesicles as therapeutic vehicles are being tested preclinically or in clinical trials: implantation of donor cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells, which release extracellular vesicles on site; injection of purified, unmodified extracellular vesicles from cultured donor cells; injection of purified extracellular vesicles that have been modified for targeting or loading of cargo in vitro; injection of extracellular vesicles enriched in cargo of interest and/or with enhanced targeting/uptake properties from genetically modified cells; and implantation of genetically modified cells that release modified extracellular vesicles in vivo (Fig. 4). A few examples of these strategies taken from a large literature are provided here. First, mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles with their intrinsic composition of RNAs and proteins are being evaluated for treatment of cerebellar ataxia (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01649687), bone repair245 and regeneration of macular holes in the eye (NCT03437759), although the role of specific RNAs in therapeutic efficacy has not yet been defined. Extensive effort is directed at loading isolated extracellular vesicles and adding targeting moieties to their surface to improve cargo delivery. For example, mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles transfected with miR-124 \u2014 an miRNA most abundantly expressed in the central nervous system and negatively associated with neural progenitor differentiation \u2014 are being tested as treatment for ischaemic stroke (NCT03384433), and mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles loaded with an miRNA against mutant KRAS are being tested as a therapy for pancreatic cancer (NCT03608631). In another example, loading of extracellular vesicles with cholesterol-conjugated siRNA to huntingtin mRNA has been shown to be effective in lowering levels of the protein in a mouse model of Huntington disease171. As discussed earlier, including a bone-targeting aptamer on the surface of extracellular vesicles derived from bone marrow stromal cells is an efficient strategy to therapeutically target the bone marrow in a mouse model of osteoporosis201. It is also possible to harvest extracellular vesicles from genetically modified producer cells presenting targeting peptides, load them with desired cargo and administer them in vivo. This strategy alleviated pathology in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where extracellular vesicles were designed to target muscle and loaded with splice-correcting antisense nucleotides targeting dystrophin (the alteration of which causes pathology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy)197. On the front of using entire cells rather that purified extracellular vesicle administration, preclinical studies have explored genetically modified glioma cells expressing high levels of a cluster of miRNAs (which are incorporated into extracellular vesicles) to suppress growth of non-modified glioma cells in mouse brain246. In another study, increased yields of extracellular vesicles from HEK293T cells loaded with mRNA for the antioxidant enzyme catalase with ligands for neuronal targeting and endosomal escape were effective in combatting neurotoxicity and Parkinson disease-associated neurodegeneration in mice after subcutaneous implantation161.",

In this case, dendritic-cell-derived extracellular vesicles harbouring on their surface major histocompatibility complexes, which before injection were pulsed with tumour-specific peptides, thereby providing a platform for efficient delivery of immunogenic tumour antigens, were injected into patients (see, for example, ref.252). In further development of extracellular vesicles as vaccines, it is possible that extracellular vesicle delivery of mRNAs for pathogenic proteins into dendritic cells (see, for example, ref.253) might potentiate vaccination without the need to generate and inactivate pathogenic viruses or bacteria. Similarly, dendritic cell-derived extracellular vesicles can be loaded with total tumour RNA or lysate, providing an abundant source of tumour-specific antigens254. In another avenue of using extracellular vesicles in antitumour vaccination, it was shown that tumour-derived extracellular vesicles can promote the antitumorigenic responses in dendritic cells. In this case extracellular vesicles from the tumour can be used directly or could be used for preloading dendritic cells before their implantation into the patient (as dendritic cell-based antitumour vaccines), with the latter showing so far greater therapeutic potential.",

            "text": "While there is consensus that RNAs in extracellular vesicles mediate communication among cells, and there are demonstrated examples of specific RNAs carried by extracellular vesicles from one cell type mediating defined phenotypic effects on target cells, many questions remain to be resolved before we will be able to fully decipher this complex language. There are a variety of types of extracellular vesicles that differ in size and protein, lipid and RNA cargo. So far, attempts to characterize unique extracellular vesicle subclasses have proved challenging, in large part owing to technical and biological limitations and challenges involved in separation and molecular analysis of these nanoscale structures. Moreover, the RNA content of extracellular vesicles is quite complex, mostly comprising small non-coding RNAs, the function of most of which are just beginning to be elucidated. There is growing evidence that different extracellular vesicle subclasses carry different RNA cargo, but a comprehensive cataloguing of this cargo awaits the development of efficient methods to identify and separate extracellular vesicle subclasses. It is possible that some extracellular vesicles have a higher content of functional RNAs and others serve more as \u2018rubbish bags\u2019 for the source cell (still, jettisoning of certain RNAs can have functional consequences for both source cells and recipient cells). In terms of extracellular vesicle-mediated signalling, the modes by which extracellular vesicle subclasses are \u2018addressed\u2019 to different recipient cell types await delineation. Although we know miRNAs and mRNAs in extracellular vesicles can be transferred to and be active in recipient cells, it remains to be determined what percentage of the RNA cargo performs functions and what percentage is lost to degradation (or is simply not functional in the recipient cell). A key issue here is the endosomal escape routes of RNA in extracellular vesicles, as this step appears to be the major bottleneck in efficient functional delivery of cargo. Given the apparent roles of extracellular vesicles in physiology and disease, understanding these issues is critical to providing insights into pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions. In this Review, we have provided a platform of the current state of knowledge of RNA transported in extracellular vesicles on which the field can build another level of understanding. In parallel, there is a burgeoning field of nanoparticles that can efficiently carry mRNA and siRNA to cells and escape the endosome (see, for example, refs255,256). It will be important for the extracellular vesicle and nanoparticle/liposome fields to engage in dialogue and combine the best properties of both for therapeutic applications257.",

Functionally, these RNAs can be divided into those with known functions, for example some mRNA, microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (green zone), those with predicted functions, for example, some transfer RNA, small nucleolar RNA, small nuclear RNA, Y RNA and vault RNA (blue zone) and those with unknown functions, for example, fragmented and degraded (methylated and uridylidated) RNA species (orange zone). This heterogeneity is further enhanced by the fact that extracellular vesicle cargo content strongly depends on the context (for example, cell type, stimuli and treatments). The effect that different kinds of RNA in vesicles can have on recipient cells is dictated in part by the nature of these cells, which will show differential capability for recognizing specific vesicles, their uptake and ultimately their functional effect.",

            "text": "Fig. 2: A variety of different RNA species can be packaged into extracellular vesicles. A number of modalities have been proposed for incorporation of (specific) RNAs into extracellular vesicles. First, RNAs can be targeted to the plasma membrane and released as microvesicles. They can also be targeted to the endosomal compartment and incorporated into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of the multivesicular body (MVB), which then can be targeted to the plasma membrane, where it fuses to release ILVs as as exosomes. Both these modes of biogenesis share many factors, and hence the vesicle type and vesicle origin are typically difficult to ascertain and control. Membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) have been strongly associated with the release of extracellular vesicles. Also, cytoskeletal components are implicated in extracellular vesicle biogenesis, in particular for exosomes, which are transported via microtubules, and their docking at the plasma membrane is supported by Arp2/3-generated branched-actin filaments stabilized by the actin-bundling activity of cortactin. Cortical actin remodelling is also an important event in membrane shaping during microvesicle release (not shown). Loading of RNA into extracellular vesicles can occur via multiple routes: passively due to an abundance of the RNA in the cytosol; by recognition via a number of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), such as Argonaute, annexin A2, major vault protein (MVP), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1),YBX1, SYNCRIP and lupus La protein, that bind particular sequence motifs in the RNA or that recognize unique secondary RNA structures; and through specific modifications, such as uridylation. Packaging of RNA into extracellular vesicles can also be promoted by its recognition by retroviral coat proteins such as Gag (and their silent copies present in animal genomes), which efficiently target RNAs they recognize to the plasma membrane (or the membrane of the MVB; not shown), resulting in virus-like particle release.",

            "text": "Fig. 3: After encountering the recipient cell, the extracellular vesicle is typically bound to its surface via cell-surface receptors (although extracellular vesicles can also be engulfed from the environment in a process known as macropinocytosis; not shown). After establishing an interaction with the cell surface, the vesicle can remain bound on the surface or can be internalized (1). One possible means of internalization is direct fusion with the plasma membrane (2), but the most common mechanism of internalization involves endocytosis, whereby extracellular vesicles are taken up to endosomes (3). In the endosome, RNA content might be released into the luminal space (if the integrity of the extracellular vesicle membrane is perturbed) or it might be released into the cytoplasm (of note, the frequency of these events is low, and endosomal escape of extracellular vesicle cargo is currently an important bottleneck in functional RNA cargo delivery by extracellular vesicles). In both cases RNAs can be recognized by pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I or NOD-like receptors that reside in the endosome and in the cytoplasm, respectively, raising innate immune response signalling (4). Early endosomes will gradually transform into late endosomes with progressive internal acidification and possible release of RNA (stimulated by the decreasing pH) (5). Further down the endocytic pathway, endosomes will mature into lysosomes, in which the cargo that has not been released to the cytoplasm will be degraded (6). RNA cargo that reaches the cytoplasm can elicit its functional effect. For example, mRNA can be translated into a functional protein, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the resulting fluorescence can act as a reporter of functional delivery of extracellular vesicle cargo (7). When small interfering RNA (siRNA) cargo is released into the cytoplasm, it can inhibit translation of specific transcripts, such as those encoding fluorescent proteins. In this case, disappearance of fluorescence will report on functional delivery of extracellular vesicle cargo (8). Extracellular vesicles can be tracked along this route with use of different reagents or labelling strategies (Table 3). 5\u2032ppp-RNA, 5\u2032- triphosphorylated RNA.",
