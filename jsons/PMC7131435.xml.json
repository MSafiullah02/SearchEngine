This paper reports the study findings in relation to immunisation. At the time the focus groups were held certain immunisations were compulsory in Belgium, Greece, Italy and Poland, with non-compliance theoretically punishable by fines or temporary imprisonment for the parents and refusal of school enrolment for children; financial incentives aimed to encourage parents to have their children immunised in Austria; and financial incentives aimed to encourage healthcare professionals to increase immunisation coverage in Ireland and the United Kingdom [15]. In contrast, immunisation was completely voluntary and without incentives in Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and other countries (although this is not to deny the existence of social pressure or pressure from healthcare professionals to immunise).",

Focus groups were held during September and October 2003 when the global panic surrounding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was at a peak. This may have heightened public awareness over the dangers of communicable diseases and thus possibly increased support for immunisation per se and for State powers to impose vaccinations. However, this was also a time when fears over vaccine safety continued to be in the public consciousness in particular countries [19], for example, MMR in Ireland, Italy and the UK [20], [21], [22], [23] and the use of mercury as a binding agent in the USA [6], [24], [25]. In some countries such concerns may have reduced support for immunisation and/or led to greater support for parental freedom to choose.

Where this \u2018foreign threat\u2019 was raised as an issue, participants tended to \u2018blame\u2019 the European Union's eastern neighbours, notably the Albanians and the Russians. However, this was very much a minority voice, with generally only one or two participants from each country where the issue was raised making reference to a \u2018foreign threat\u2019. The fact that the timing of the focus groups coincided with the global panic over Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease spread between countries largely through international travel, could have influenced such comments.",

The latter point is illustrative of the immunisation paradox, a phenomenon whereby the success of previous public health measures, mass immunisation and consequent herd immunity have reduced the prevalence of particular diseases leading parents to believe that the current threat of infection from such diseases is minimal. Some parents may thus refuse to have their children immunised on the grounds that the risks associated with immunisation, though small, are perceived to outweigh the benefits [41]. Paradoxically, the success of immunisation programmes may ultimately reduce take-up rates with the potential for future epidemics of preventable diseases [42], [43], [44]. Again this reflects findings from other studies [45], [46].",

This finding has been supported by other research [31], [47], [48].

Sweden provides an interesting example. The MMR scare was widely reported in the Swedish media and was met with a brief decline in immunisation coverage. However, once the public health authorities provided clear and open information relating to the potential risks and benefits of immunisation, high rates of coverage were quickly restored. This suggests that public trust in public health authorities was largely maintained or secured. Indeed, none of the Swedish focus group participants spoke of fears over vaccine safety. By contrast, where participants spent most of their time debating the relative risks of immunisation versus non-immunisation or where they opposed immunisation on the grounds of safety concerns, this tended to correlate with an expressed lack of trust in the advice and reassurances of the State and public health agencies.",

Even in countries where vaccine scares were in the public consciousness and some participants expressed concern over exposing their (hypothetical) child to immunisation, their concern was over the type of vaccination (for example, multiple-antigen vaccines) rather than about immunisation per se. The extent to which participants supported the notion of compulsory immunisation depended largely on whether certain immunisations were already compulsory in their country, whether they trusted the State and public health professionals to take immunisation decisions on their behalf, whether individuals felt they had enough information to make their own informed choices, and the extent to which they felt that compulsion was necessary to ensure that enough other people in their society had their children immunised to achieve herd immunity. Each of these factors is influenced by a myriad of other assumptions, actors and institutions, including family, community, media, religious beliefs, political structures and historical factors. Each could be the subject of illuminating further research.",
