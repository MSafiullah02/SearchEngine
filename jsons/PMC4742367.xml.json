The net social benefits of such measures have also been assessed (Gupta et al. 2005; Bridges et al. 2000; Cauchemez et al. 2009; Sadique et al. 2008; Sadique et al. 2007; Sander et al. 2009). Less attention has been paid to the benefits of private disease-risk mitigation measures such as contact reduction, prophylaxis, private vaccination, or preferential mixing according to health status (Fenichel 2013; Fenichel et al. 2011; Gross et al. 2006; Maharaj and Kleczkowski 2012), and almost no attention has been paid to the net social benefits of private disease-risk mitigation (Reluga 2010). We address this problem here.",

Since we model neither memory nor learning, recovery with immunity allows us to treat each outbreak as an independent event. We also ignore births and deaths. We suppose that susceptible and infected people behave in different ways as a function of disease risk, and not as a function of the infection itself (as in the case of, for example, gonorrhea (Yorke et al. 1978; Blank et al. 2008)). Within each health class, we assume that all individuals respond to risk in the same way and so ignore any sources of heterogeneity in the behavioral response of individuals due to, for example, age, gender, or occupation (Albarrac\u00edn et al. 2005; Klepac and Caswell 2011; Khan et al. 2009). Among possible risk mitigation strategies, we focus on the case where reactive individuals, defined as susceptible, asymptomatic, or recovered asymptomatic individuals, preferentially mix with healthy people and avoid sick people.1 How much reactive people adjust their pattern of contacts depends on the relative costs of preferential mixing and the expected cost of illness. If the disease risk is positive, where risk is the probability of illness multiplied by its cost, individuals will invest in preferential mixing up to the point at which the marginal expected costs of disease and of disease avoidance are equalized. Investment in preferential mixing will increase with the cost of disease and decrease with the cost of disease avoidance.",

We then compare the cost of epidemics with and without preferential mixing to measure when, and under what conditions, private disease-risk mitigation is socially beneficial. We show that the social net benefit of private disease-risk mitigation is systematically related to the characteristics both of the disease and of the society in which the disease occurs. If the benefit of avoided illness is high compared to the cost of avoidance, we find that private disease-risk mitigation always yields net benefits to society. As the relative benefits of avoided illness become smaller, however, so do the net benefits to society. Whether proportionate or preferential mixing is more costly then depends on the weight that society gives to the private cost of illness and the rate at which they discount future relative to present costs. We show the conditions under which private disease-risk mitigation results in a net loss to society and consider what this means for infectious disease management in general, for a rich/poor world in particular.",

In most models, the probability of contact between individuals in different compartments depends only on their prevalence in the population (proportionate mixing). By contrast, we suppose that individuals mix preferentially, conditional on their own disease state and the (observable) disease states of others. As in (Fenichel et al. 2011), a mixing strategy depends on the relative costs of illness and illness avoidance.",

This framework has been shown to provide the most mathematically general solution to the problem of who mixes with whom (Blythe et al. 1991; Levin 1995). Groups may be defined by various shared attributes, including economic status, cultural or ethnic identity, geographical location, age, or disease awareness. In this paper, we define groups by their epidemiological status. The use of the affinity framework allows for three different factors to control the volume of contact between groups: (1) the size of each group, (2) the nominal activity levels of each group, and (3) the relative affinity/disaffinity between groups. We model the decision process behind changes in the affinity/disaffinity between groups, focusing on decisions made by susceptible or asymptomatically infectious (a subset of reactive) individuals. We hold the nominal level of activity (volume of contacts) constant throughout the course of the epidemic to measure more accurately the effect of changes in mixing preferences (see (Fenichel et al. 2011) for a treatment that affects only the volume of contacts for the reactive class and (Morin et al. 2014) for more details on varying contact volume versus contact type). To illustrate the approach, we first focus on a susceptible-infectious-recovered, SIR, model:1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\begin{array}{l}\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}=-c\\beta S(t){P}_{SI},\\hfill \\\\ {}\\frac{dI(t)}{dt}=c\\beta S(t){P}_{SI}-\\gamma I(t),\\hfill \\\\ {}\\frac{dR(t)}{dt}=\\gamma I(t).\\hfill \\end{array} $$\\end{document}dStdt=\u2212c\u03b2StPSI,dItdt=c\u03b2StPSI\u2212\u03b3It,dRtdt=\u03b3It.\n",

Note that this may not be true for diseases like chicken pox or measles, where the costs of contracting the disease are much lower among children than adults. The parents of reactive children may actually seek out infection for their children to prevent the large cost of infection as an adult. In our case, however, reactive individuals assess the risk of illness and select the preferential mixing strategies that maximize the expected net benefits of those strategies where future and current costs of disease are the same. Specifically, individuals will increase effort to avoid infection up to the point where the marginal cost is offset by the marginal benefits (in terms of avoided illness) it yields. Efforts to avoid infection will be increasing in the cost of illness and decreasing in the cost of illness avoidance including any forgone benefits from contact with infectious individuals. In models without risk mitigation, disease dynamics may be completely characterized from initial conditions. With risk mitigation, the evolution of the epidemic reflects feedbacks between the cost of disease and disease avoidance on the one hand and averting behavior on the other (see (Fenichel and Horan 2007; Horan et al. 2011) for further discussion).",

Within the one-path model, susceptible individuals are first asymptomatically infectious and then progress to symptomatically infectious and then immune. In the two-path model, a susceptible individual becomes either asymptomatically or symptomatically infectious and then recovers. Individuals who recover from asymptomatic infection (RA) are expected to be reactive. Individuals who recover from symptomatic infection (RI) are not. We did not consider models with reentry to the susceptible class, e.g., SIS, SIRS, and other cyclical models. This is for two reasons. First, each of these models is capable of endemic levels of infection. This, combined with the fact that people may experience reinfection, would require individuals to form expectations (possess memory) with respect to the impact of different avoidance strategies. Second, numerical simulations of these models reveal very broad oscillations that confound comparison with single outbreak models. There are no entries (births) or removals (deaths) from the system (see Table 2 for example diseases listed for each model). Each model considered here is therefore a so-called single outbreak model; the population is not only kept at a fixed number, but it is also closed to the introduction of new individuals.\n",

These affect the interpretation to be given of the point at which an epidemic is \u201cover.\u201d It is feasible that an extremely strong avoidance response early in the course of the epidemic could wipe out the infection within a population. However, within the differential equation framework, as soon as those behavioral adjustments are loosened, coupled with the fact that there is a nonzero infectious population with potentially a very large susceptible population, the infection will again spread, potentially causing additional peaks. To characterize the point at which an epidemic is over, we therefore measured the slope of a best-fit line on the last 50 time steps and then measured the variance of the data contained within that time window. If each was sufficiently close to zero (I < 0.005) we concluded that the dynamics had stopped. The beginning of the time window where these conditions were met was then treated as the end time of the epidemic.\n",

This implies that the private cost of illness is given the same weight by society regardless of whether that cost is high or low to individuals. Individuals are assumed to respond to the cost of illness as described above, and the net payoff to society relative to proportionate mixing is judged solely in terms of the strength of the private response. In this special case, we see a different relation between the social discount rate and the likelihood that private disease-risk mitigation will be socially beneficial. As we vary the (daily) social discount factor and the private cost of illness in this case, we see that if the private cost of illness is low, proportionate mixing always dominates preferential mixing. However, as the private cost of illness rises, whether proportionate or preferential mixing dominates depends on the discount rate. If the cost of illness is extremely high, and the social discount rate is less than or equal to the private discount rate, preferential mixing dominates proportionate mixing in all cases. If the cost of illness is intermediate, however, preferential mixing dominates proportionate mixing only at either very high or very low discount rates (\u03c1 \u226a 1, \u03c1 \u2248 1).",

While vaccination (either privately chosen or publically mandated) is the main form of risk mitigation for many diseases, private \u201cdistancing\u201d strategies that reduce exposure to infectious classes are also common. Private effort to avoid infection depends on the costs and benefits of that effort for the individual. Whether private risk mitigation also benefits society depends on the way it changes epidemic dynamics. We find that private disease-risk mitigation always not only reduces the number falling ill but also extends the duration of epidemics. While the social net benefits of private disease-risk mitigation are, intuitively, increasing in the social cost of illness and decreasing in the cost of illness avoidance, they are also sensitive to the timing of these costs. Whether private risk mitigation generates social benefits relative to proportionate mixing\u2014i.e., whether the social cost of illness and illness avoidance is lower under preferential than proportionate mixing\u2014depends both on the social weight on the private cost of illness and on the social discount rate. We find that if the private cost of illness is high relative to the social cost of illness, then society may be better off allowing a disease to run its course without incurring the cost of disease avoidance. Similarly, if the social discount rate is very low relative to the private discount rate, society may be better off avoiding the prolongation of epidemics that comes with preferential mixing. If private and social discount rates and private and social costs are not substantially different, however, private disease-risk mitigation will ordinarily generate positive social benefits over proportionate mixing.",

Our findings suggest that one explanation for this lies in differences in the private response to disease risk in developed and developing countries and hence to differences in the relative private costs of illness and illness avoidance. In countries where the private cost of illness avoidance is high relative to the cost of illness (i.e., the income forgone by the sick), we would expect very little private disease-risk mitigation.

There are various reasons why the private and social costs of illness and illness avoidance might be expected to differ. The case most often explored in the literature is the public good nature of illness avoidance. Self-protection through vaccination, for example, is an impure public good. It not only confers benefits on the individual but also confers benefits on others (Andre et al. 2008; Boulier et al. 2007). Since the benefits to others will typically not be part of the private vaccination decision, however, the private value of vaccination will be less than the social value (Bauch and Earn 2004). In such cases, public health authorities may have an interest in increasing the level of private disease-risk mitigation (Chowell et al. 2009; Sandler 2004).",

In setting up the public health authority\u2019s problem, it is the disease dynamics that come out of this process that are relevant. There is now a growing literature on the impact of private contact and mixing decisions on disease transmission (Gersovitz and Hammer 2004; Gersovitz and Hammer 2003; Barrett and Hoel 2007; Fenichel et al. 2010; Springborn et al. 2010). From a public health perspective, an understanding of the decision process improves the capacity to predict the dynamics of epidemics, but it also opens up a new set of disease management options. Options that target either the contact rate (Auld 2003; Kremer 1996) or the probability that contact leads to infection (Geoffard and Philipson 1996) have already been assessed. Options that target preferential mixing have not. The implications of the general approach for public health policy are now being explored (Fenichel 2013), but the effect of differences between social and private assessments of the appropriate weight to be given to the cost of illness now and in the future has yet to be considered.",

One implication is that effort to build the capacity of the weakest link should be sufficient to address the problem, and capacity building is in fact written in to both the International Health Regulations (World Health Organization 2005) and the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement (the main multilateral agreements governing responses to infectious human, animal, and plant diseases) (World Trade Organization 1995). Our findings indicate the problem may be deeper than that. It may not be that poor communities and poor countries would do more if they could, but that doing more may not be in their own interest. Interventions that best serve the public interest in rich communities may not best serve the public interest in poor communities. To prevent the wider spread of outbreaks in poor countries, countries in which the opportunity cost of illness is high may need to incentivize risk mitigation in poor countries.
