In 2003, World Health Organisation (WHO) coined the word SARS for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in patients with a relevant travel/contact history and sars (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . The WHO case definition of suspected SARS was fever, respiratory symptoms and close contact with SARS patients or history of travel to an epidemic area (http:// www.who.int/csr/sars/casedefinition) (3) . Aetiologic diagnosis was unnecessary in the clinical definition, so patients clinically diagnosed with SARS may not have the SARS coronavirus (5) . Any patient in an epidemic area with fever and cough would be diagnosed as SARS by WHO definition in 2003. The clinical features are essentially the same as for any respiratory viral infections or pneumonitis. Towards the end of the 2003 epidemics, SARS coronavirus was identified to be the culprit, and the definition incorporated the aetiologic agent. This laboratory definition downplays the importance of disease severity and symptomatology, so patient with mild respiratory symptoms or even nonrespiratory symptoms could still be diagnosed as SARS if coronavirus is isolated. Conversely, patients with sars but no coronavirus isolated were not considered as SARS. The term has shifted from clinical diagnosis to a virologic diagnosis. Subsequently, it was realised that the clinical features of many patients with laboratory SARS were neither 'severe' nor 'respiratory' in nature. Nevertheless, imprecise definition carries serious public health implications that patients may be erroneously quarantined and cities stigmatised.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 298, "end": 301, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 302, "end": 305, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 306, "end": 309, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 310, "end": 313, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 314, "end": 317, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 518, "end": 521, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 666, "end": 669, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Since 2003, many new surveillance guidelines and confusing abbreviations appeared in the city of Hong Kong. For instance,'ILI' represents influenza-like illness [including upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or upper respiratory infection or illness (URI)], 'HSI' for human swine influenza (i.e. novel H1N1-2009), RD for respiratory disease or respiratory distress, and ards for acute respiratory diseases (which is not the same as ARDS for Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome for children). The definitions for many of these abbreviations are nearly identical as the clinical definition of SARS (i.e. respiratory symptomatology \u03ee fever \u03ee contact). This can be unnecessarily confusing. Indeed, the only difference between ILI, influenza, avian flu, swine flu, ards and SARS is the virus, and all may result in ARDS ( SARS has seemingly disappeared from the planet. However, the term was raised from time to time for tested specimens drawn from the boy's airway and found he had H1N1 flu, not novel coronavirus. The boy's father also had a fever 2 days before the boy caught the disease, but recovered. Now that the winter flu season is approaching, CHP and DH will keep themselves busy with many cases of sars or ards to come. In medicine, a definition or syndrome representing 'a constellation of symptomatology seen in association' should stand the trial of time after it is coined. We always teach medical students to avoid confusing abbreviations. It is high time we finalise a time-proof definition for these epidemic viral pneumonitis (2, 3) . Health organisations should provide consistent definitions for index surveillance, epidemiological and prognostication studies.
