In practice, APT originates from the concept proposed by Malaysia in the early 1990s\u2014EAEG, which was renamed EAEC by Indonesia (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-40262-8_2#Sec3). In accordance with the will expressed by ASEAN countries, during the Fifth Summit held in December 1995, Singapore\u2019s prime minister Goh Chok Tong made a proposal to invite Japan, China and South Korea to the Association\u2019s next summit (scheduled in 12 or 18 months, and the first informal summit) (ASEAN 1995). Thus, it was a concrete proposal in terms of the participants of the meeting, its venue as well as organisational matters. In July 1996, during the 29th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) held in Jakarta, Malaysia\u2019s foreign minister Ali Alatas presented a document related to the EAEC concept in which he recommended that the planned First Informal Summit follow the \u201c7+3+3\u201d formula. The additional participants included Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar\u2014the countries which aspired to membership in ASEAN (Terada 2003). However, the meeting was not attended by all the invited parties due to the lack of consensus among ASEAN member states as well as time limits.",

In January 1997, Japan\u2019s prime minister Ry\u016btar\u014d Hashimoto, during his visit to ASEAN countries, proposed holding an additional ASEAN\u2013Japan Summit.1 Prime minister Hashimoto sought ASEAN\u2019s support for Japan\u2019s crisis-hit economy in face of China\u2019s increasing economic and political power.2 In response to Japan\u2019s proposal, ASEAN countries\u2014attempting to avoid the negative consequences of disregarding the two powers of East Asia\u2019s north subregion\u2014expressed their will to invite Chinese and South Korean representatives to attend the Summit. The formal decision in this matter, as well as with regard to the accession of CLM countries, was made at the end of May 1997.3 The final compromise reached by ASEAN countries resulted in holding three separate summits attended by each country of the North, and, separately, one common EAS (the decision was made at the Second ASEAN Informal Summit held from 14 to 16 December 1997). It can be concluded that Hashimoto\u2019s doctrine\u2014as planned by its creator\u2014led to establishing ASEAN\u2212Japan Summits, but it also resulted in the APT First Summit (Tanaka 2007).4\n",

            "text": "In this context, it is worth mentioning that ASEAN leaders decided to develop an outline for the structure of ASEAN+3 before the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis. This is a significant fact because cooperation in East Asia\u2019s entire territory was directly driven by political regionalism and security issues rather than by the intention to tighten economic links. However, the Asian crisis had a major impact on intensifying intraregional cooperation, justifying this form of mutual contacts. Consequently, in the context of the failure to establish the AMF (right after the outbreak of the crisis), and contrary to the original plans to focus the summit debates on diplomatic issues, the First APT Summit was dominated by discussions related to the rapidly deteriorating financial crisis. However, apart from the fact that the Second Informal ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur proposed the ASEAN Vision 2020, it did not lead to any significant resolutions or agreements adopted by a larger composition of participants extended by the ASEAN+3 structure. Simultaneously, the personal changes of government leaders in most East Asia\u2019s crisis-stricken countries5 offered new opportunities for intraregional cooperation.6\n",

In addition to that, Kim Dae-jung proposed establishing the East Asia Vision Group (EAVG)\u2014a group composed of outstanding intellectuals from APT countries, acting as an ASEAN+3 group of advisors for creating long-term visions for the region\u2019s revitalisation and mutual economic cooperation. Relevant recommendations were to be presented at the Fifth APT Summit in 2001. Another step in the process of ASEAN+3\u2019s institutionalisation was a proposal made by Hu Jintao to hold meetings of East Asian financial experts.7 Simultaneously, Japan proposed establishing the New Miyazawa Initiative\u2014financial support offered to crisis-hit countries in the amount of USD 30 billion (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-40262-8_2#Sec3).

The document comprised two groups of commitments. The first one referred to economic and social issues. ASEAN+3 countries made a commitment to engage in cooperation in six areas: economic issues, monetary and financial matters, human resource and social development, culture and information, scientific and technological development and general development programmes. The other group was related to political and other relations. ASEAN+3 leaders decided to strengthen cooperation in resolving political, security and transnational issues with a view to increasing mutual understanding and finding common solutions to existing problems. They also agreed to intensify cooperation and increase coordination in relations with international organisations including the UN, the WTO, APEC and ASEM.

Therefore, the Summit was followed by a series of ministerial meetings and the enlargement of the institution structure of ASEAN+3.

With regard to the \u201cantagonisms\u201d, it should be stressed that the Third APT Summit was a breakthrough change in the relations among Northeast Asian countries, which held their first three-party meeting. The concept proposed by Japan\u2019s prime minister Obuchi to hold separate meetings for the leaders of East Asia\u2019s three northern nations was approved by the remaining parties.

It is worth a while to refer to the previously mentioned fact\u2014during the Summit China\u2019s prime minister Rongji Zhu made a proposal to appoint a group of experts for strengthening economic cooperation and establishing an FTA. At the Fourth APT Summit, the leaders of ASEAN+3 countries supported Kim Dae-jung\u2019s proposal to establish the East Asia Study Group (EASG). It was to be composed of APT high ranking officials (one representative of each country) and the secretary general of ASEAN.

The first one related to economic issues and focused on the following activities: facilitating trade in accordance with Bogor goals and establishing the East Asia Free Trade Area (EAFTA), establishing the East Asia Investment Area (EAIA) through implementing the Framework Agreement on AIA in the entire territory, supporting cooperation in technologies and economic development (especially in the least developed countries), creating knowledge-based economies and economies oriented on future economic structures (development of nanotechnology, biotechnology and IT), harmonising internet and e-trade applications (through protecting intellectual property rights). The second group of EAVG objectives related to finance. The Vision Group proposed implementing agreements on regional financial self-help programmes and coordinating exchange rate mechanisms (to maintain financial stability).

The two parties adopted a joint declaration on a strategic partnership for peace and prosperity, in which they announced strengthening economic cooperation and undertaking the following activities: cooperating in five key industries (agriculture, informatics and telecommunication, human resource development, mutual investment projects and the development of the Mekong River Basin), strengthening social cooperation (public health, education and environmental protection), cooperating in political and security issues as well as participating in regional and international cooperation programmes (China gave its full support to the membership of Laos and Vietnam in the WTO, and expressed its intention to implement DOC agreements) (ASEAN-China 2003).",

The Declaration stressed the transparency, openness and future orientation of East Asian integration, as well as the complementary and supporting functions performed by other structures in the APT process (including APEC, ASEM, ARF and EAS). With a view to strengthening and rationalising ASEAN+3 cooperation, five major areas of activity were identified. The first one comprised politics and security\u2014closer dialogue and cooperation achieved as a result of regular meetings, the exchange of information and human resource management. The second area of activities referred to economic and financial cooperation\u2014stimulating economic growth and sustainable development aimed to ensure a free movement of goods, services, capital and people; supporting economic integration; ensuring free trade, its transparency, as well as the implementation of intellectual property rights; carrying out structural reforms and promoting mutual investment projects. With regard to the financial sector, the Declaration recommended the multilateralisation of CMI (Chiang Mai Initiative) and the strengthening of ABMI. The third cooperation area identified by ASEAN+3 for the subsequent decade comprised energy, the environment and climate change. The Declaration reaffirmed the need for ensuring energy security (through diversified supplies, increased energy efficiency and new renewable sources of energy), counteracting the effects of climate change, and for seeking balance between sustainable economic development and social development. The fourth cooperation area within the ASEAN+3 framework comprised socio-cultural and development-related issues, focusing on the following activities: achieving the Millennium Development Goals, narrowing development gaps (through implementing VAP and IAI), and supporting subregional cooperation programmes as well as educational and cultural projects.

The Plan comprised such activities as the electrification of ASEAN rural areas, supporting the ASEAN Centre for Energy, the use of ecological technologies (e.g. in motorcars), considering EAS and APEC energy-related projects and proposals and establishing dialogue with Middle East gas and oil producers. The second group of issues related to the environment and sustainable development.

India, belonging to South Asia, and Australia and New Zealand as part of the Pacific region, were invited to attend the Malaysia Summit under the pressure of Indonesia, which made attempts to balance the growing power of China. On the other hand, some of East Asian countries, especially China and Malaysia, advocated a structure focused on regional needs and based on close cultural and social bonds.

Moreover, the establishment of Jakarta-based ERIA\u2014an institution focused on regional integration within the framework of ASEAN and the EAS, the first institutional structure comprising 16 EAS member states\u2014was another factor which shifted China\u2019s interests towards ASEAN+3.

            "text": "\nThis proposal, reflecting Hashimoto\u2019s doctrine, referred to annual ASEAN\u2013Japan summit meetings as well as bilateral meetings with ASEAN member states to discuss security issues (Tow 2001).Japan\u2019s major problems in its relations with China were posed by the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis resulting from China\u2019s missile tests conducted in March 1996 (the first two crises took place in 1955 and 1958). The conducted tests reflected the Communist Party\u2019s concerns caused by Taiwan\u2019s intensified independence movements and the attempts (futile, as it turned out) to influence Taiwan\u2019s first popular presidential elections (as expected, the winner was Lee Teng-hui). The missile tests resulted in the USA\u2019s demonstration of its maritime military might (two US aircraft carriers sent to the region of Formosa). These events caused Japan\u2019s concerns about East Asia\u2019s security and stability. It should be noted that apart from Japan\u2019s endeavours to maintain the region\u2019s balance of power through cooperation with ASEAN, the government of this country embarked on the process of tightening relations with Russia and the USA (Yuzawa 2007; Tanaka 2007).On 23 July 1997, Laos and Myanmar joined ASEAN. Cambodia\u2019s accession was postponed due to political conflicts in this country in July 1997. Consequently, Cambodia was ASEAN\u2019s youngest member state upon its accession on 30 April 1999.ASEAN+1 Summits were initiated for similar reasons (ASEAN\u2019s intention not to disregard geopolitically significant entities). This concept was officially discussed for the first time at the Seventh ASEAN Summit in November 2001, with special attention given to India. The First ASEAN\u2212India Summit was held on 5 November 2002 (accompanying the Eighth ASEAN Summit, at which ASEAN countries agreed to consider a similar method for maintaining relations with Australia).This period recorded the following political changes (in chronological order): Thailand (November 1997)\u2014prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh stepped down and was replaced by Chuan Leekpai (serving as prime minister until 2001); South Korea\u2014in January 1998, Kim Dae-jung was sworn in as president, replacing Kim Young Sam, who resigned from office due to a corruption scandal (Kim Dae-jung, serving as president until 2003, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for promoting democratic principles, human rights and the reconciliation process in the Korean Peninsula and the entire territory of East Asia); Indonesia\u2014in May 1998, following a wave of social unrest, Jusuf Habibie replaced president Suharto (serving as president since 1967), and served his term of office until October 1999); Japan\u2014prime minister Hashimoto was forced to resign in July 1998, replaced by Keiz\u014d Obuchi\u2019ego (serving until April 2000); Malaysia\u2014Mahathir, ruling the country since 1981, retained his position, but Anwar Ibrahim, who supported the plan of reforms recommended by the IMF, was dismissed as deputy prime minister and the minister of finance in September 1998.These changes were accelerated by the visible marginalisation of Japan by its major ally\u2014the USA, accompanied by considerable improvements in US\u2013China relations. From 27 October to 3 November 1997, China\u2019s president Jiang Zemin paid a visit to the USA at the invitation of US president Clinton (the first visit in 12 years). China was revisited by the president Clinton from 25 June to 3 July 1998. During the visit, the US president said he \u201cdid not support independence for Taiwan\u201d (this statement was criticised by the US Senate Resolution of 7 July 1998). Moreover, the US president did not consider a visit to Japan during his nine-day visit to China, and he even criticised Japan\u2019s government for mismanaging its economy. This fact, in the context of the US government\u2019s opposition to Japan\u2019s proposal to establish the AMF, considerably weakened the position of the world\u2019s second largest economy in an international arena and, in particular, in the East Asian region. Therefore, Japan\u2019s activities within ASEAN+3 as part of its diplomatic efforts aimed to strengthen this country\u2019s international position (moreover, the Communist Party of China reduced the significance of the Second ASEAN+3 Summit by the participation in the event of its vice president Hu Jintao, while Japan was represented by prime minister Obuchi (Cossa 1998; Tanaka 2007).The final details related to the scope of EAVG\u2019s authority were agreed at the end of 1999. (Tanaka 2007).The concept was proposed by Philippine president Joseph Estrada. At that time, the introduction of a single currency in East Asia was supported by Joseph Yam (head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, HKMA). Hong Kong made endeavours to establish a monetary union with Singapore. The idea of introducing an \u201cAsian euro\u201d was also supported by Robert Mundell\u2014a creator of the theory of optimum currency areas (Gilson 2006; Ravenhill 2006; Pomfret 2011).Attention should be given to visible similarities between EAVG and EASG concepts for the needs of a vision for APEC\u2019s development, created in the early 1990s by the Eminent Persons Group. The decision to establish EPG was made in September 1992 during the APEC Fourth Ministerial Meeting. One of EPG\u2019s major achievements was the identification of Bogor goals (the group was mainly composed of the advocates of \u201copen regionalism\u201d).Indeed, Japan and Korea joined TAC in 2004.Much controversy in Japan\u2013China relations was caused by Japanese prime minister Koizumi, who re-established the tradition of visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, a place commemorating 2.5 million Japanese (including those regarded to be war criminals) killed in 1868\u20131945 wars (the last visit was paid by prime minister Hashimoto in 1996). Another problem resulted from government-approved textbooks as well as Japan\u2019s inadequate apologies (not expressed in writing) for Japan\u2019s aggression against China. Moreover, in 2002 Japan considered establishing a free trade area with Taiwan, but the idea was abandoned for fear of worsening relations with China.The priority areas were as follows: economy and trade, environmental protection, human resource development, the ICT sector, culture, investments, tourism, finance, transport, science and technology and security policies.ASEAN\u2019s proposals (made at bilateral summits) to engage Japan and South Korea (through FDI) in the construction of hydropower plants in CLM countries. In this context, China\u2019s earlier activities in this area deserve attention.The action plan for implementing the joint Declaration on a comprehensive partnership was adopted at the next Summit in Kuala Lumpur in December 2005 (ASEAN\u2212ROK 2005a).Apart from ASEAN\u2212Japan, ASEAN\u2212China and ASEAN\u2212Korea Summits, Kuala Lumpur hosted the Fourth ASEAN\u2013India and the First ASEAN\u2013Russia Summit (December 2005).China offered preferential loans for supporting the implementation of Chinese projects in ASEAN member states. The 2005 Summit announced the contribution of an additional amount of USD 5 billion (USD 3 billion allocated over the previous five years). In addition to that, China\u2019s government committed a package of preferential export loans for developing countries in the amount of USD 10 billion (33 % of this amount to be transferred to ASEAN countries) (ASEAN\u2212China 2005a). At the ASEAN\u2212Japan Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Japan allocated USD 70 million for ASEAN integration processes, and the amount of USD 135 million for counteracting the bird flu pandemic (ASEAN\u2212Japan 2005).Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia (CEPEA)\u2014a structure composed of a larger number of members than EAFTA (East Asia Summit countries: ASEAN+3, India, Australia and New Zealand). The concept of CEPEA, a structure balancing the regional system of power (from the perspective of Japan\u2019s economic and political interests), was strongly supported by Japan as a competitive solution in relation to China\u2019s favoured EAFTA (composed of only ASEAN+3 countries).1999\u2014the first statement on cooperation; 2001 and 2002\u2014EAVG and EASG Reports; 2005\u2014the Kuala Lumpur Declaration.CMIM entered into force on 24 March 2010 (Klecha-Tylec 2014).It should be stressed that China, intending to support the concept of regional trade liberalisation, contributed the amount of USD 1 million to the APT Cooperation Fund for the EAFTA project (APT 2010a).ASEAN is currently applying for the right of permanent participation in G-20 summits to be granted to the Association\u2019s member state which undertakes presidency in a given year. A similar solution is applied to relations with the EU (the group\u2019s meetings are attended by the representatives of Germany, the UK, France and Italy). It should be noted that all \u201cplus three\u201d countries are G-20 members, while Indonesia is ASEAN\u2019s only representative in this group of nations.Talks were intensified as the result of the catastrophic floods in ASEAN\u2019s large territories (mainly in Thailand) as well as the earthquake in Japan on 11 March 2011, referred to as the Great East Japan Earthquake.This problem was referred to Japan\u2019s initiative to develop an Asian sustainable chemical security plan by 2020, and to discussions on establishing the ASEAN Chemical Data Centre\u2014a bilateral data base (ASEAN\u2013Japan 2011c).In this context, an emphasis was laid on launching the ASEAN\u2013China Science and Technology Partnership Programme (STEP 2012), which was regarded as a milestone in mutual scientific and technological cooperation.2017 was proposed as the year of \u201cASEAN\u2013ROK Cultural Exchange\u201d.The decision made in April 2012 concerning the direct exchange of Japanese and Chinese currencies. The JPY-RMB exchange (without using the US dollar as an intermediary currency) was aimed to increase mutual trade and investment, contributing to the internationalisation of both currencies.For this reason, Japan\u2019s assistance offered to Indochina targeted CLV, not CLMV. Myanmar became one of the beneficiaries of the Japanese aid programme as late as in 2011, following the commencement of democratic changes in this country. During the ASEAN\u2212Japan Summit in November 2011, Japan expressed satisfaction over Myanmar\u2019s presidency in ASEAN planned for 2014.Because of EAS members, the structure was also referred to as ASEAN+6.Full membership status in the EAS was applied for by the Russian Federation (strongly supported by China), Mongolia and Pakistan (supported by Malaysia) as well as Papua New Guinea (recommended by Australia). The European Union applied for observer status, while the USA expressed intention to attend EAS meetings without specifying a status of its participation (Dent 2008).The Kuala Lumpur Declaration concerning ASEAN\u2019s approval of full membership in the EAS specified three criteria: holding ASEAN Partner Dialogue status, the adoption of TAC, and a significant contribution to the region\u2019s economic development (Frost 2008).As the result of urban processes, city population is expected to double by 2030 as compared with 2000, when cities were inhabited by 1.7 billion Asians (EAS 2007c).In 2009, the region was hit by a number of natural disasters: tropical storm Nangka in June, leading to floods, landslides and tornados in central Philippines; the earthquake of 2 September in Indonesia (the province of West Java) and devastating typhoon Ketsana, which hit large territories in Southeast Asia, leading to floods in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. In May 2008, Myanmar was hit by cyclone Nargis, causing huge losses and gigantic floods (the number of deaths was estimated at 200,000, while 800,000 inhabitants were relocated) (Roberts 2010).The Statement was issued by Vejjajiva Abhisit, the prime minister of Thailand\u2014the country which chaired ASEAN in 2009 and coordinated the East Asia Summit.It should be noted that the Fourth East Asia Summit supported India\u2019s initiative to re-open the University of Nalanda\u2014an ancient Buddhist site of learning in the Indian State of Bihar. The University operated from the fifth to the twelfth century, offering programmes in mathematics, philosophy, medicine and astronomy to the inhabitants of East and South Asia. The idea to revive the University was initiated in 2007 by the Nalanda Mentor Group, headed by Indian economist Amartya Sen. The University, in accordance with a statement issued at the Fourth East Asia Summit, was to act as a non-governmental, non-profit and self-governing organisation\u2014a centre for educating Asia\u2019s most gifted students (EAS 2009d).It should be stressed that the Fifth EAS Summit in 2010 was attended by the representatives of the two countries: Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.EAS new member states were represented by US president Barak Obama and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. The Summit announced possible participation of the president of ADB and the UN Secretary General.However, China made a proposal to host the Second EAS Summit. The proposal was turned down in favour of Philippines, an ASEAN member state, reducing China\u2019s interest in the EAS forum. China rejected the statement originally included in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, concerning the major contribution of the EAS to building \u201cEast Asia\u2019s Community\u201d, replacing it with a statement on building a \u201ccommunity\u201d (written with a small letter) (EAS 2005a; Frost 2008).ERIA, established in 2008, was even referred to as \u201cEast Asian OECD\u201d\u2014an independent research organisation focused on trade and investment, intellectual property rights, human resource development, industrial and SME development and narrowing development gaps (Otsui, Shinoda 2008).\n",
