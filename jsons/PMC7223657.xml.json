By 2040, this number is expected to grow to 22% [1]. Medical advances have led to an increase in life expectancy and enable an active lifestyle into late adulthood, including driving at an older age [2]. As such, injury patterns in this population have shifted with trauma centers noting an increase in geriatric trauma patients (GTPs) suffering blunt trauma [3]. Additionally, octogenarians, defined as those 80\u201389 years old, are presenting to hospitals at increasing rates. Ukkonen et al. found that patients \u2265 80 years old account for 15% of all emergency room visits nationwide [4]. Management of octogenarians requires special considerations due to suppressed stress responses, impaired central nervous system, altered cardiovascular physiology, as well as overall increased comorbidities [5\u20139]. Furthermore, the decreased abdominal musculature in geriatric patients may increase their risk for blunt splenic injury (BSI) [10].",

Non-operative management (NOM) for BSI was once considered a relative contraindication in geriatric patients with failure rates reported as high as 70% [12\u201316]. More recently, however, these rates have been proven to be exaggerated. Trust et al. used the National Trauma Databank to find that GTPs had slightly higher, but comparable failure rates of NOM compared to younger adults (~ 6% versus 4%). Furthermore, this study concluded that failure of NOM for BSI was not an independent risk factor for mortality in GTPs, suggesting NOM to be a safe option. This practice is further supported by the most recent Eastern Association of the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) guidelines regarding BSI where age is no longer considered a contraindication to NOM [17].",

The injury profile included the Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and mechanism of injury. AIS is a scoring system that classifies each injury by body region on a six-point scale. The sum of the squares of the highest AIS scores for the three most severely injured body regions equals the ISS. The ISS ranges from 1 to 75 and correlates most closely with morbidity and mortality [19]. The mechanism of injuries were also evaluated to compare GTPs to octogenarians, including falls, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), pedestrian accidents, and motorcycle collisions (MCCs).",

Late failure of NOM, defined as failure 24 h after presentation, was compared to early failure (6\u201324 h post-injury).

The magnitude of the association between covariates and risk of failing NOM was measured using a univariable logistic regression model. These variables were chosen based on a review of the literature and included hypotension (systolic blood pressure \u2264 90 mmHg) within 24 h, ISS \u2265 25, massive blood product transfusion (\u2265 5 units of packed red blood cells within 4-h), severe (grade > 3) AIS for the head, spine, thorax, abdomen, history of CHF, ESRD, diabetes, hypertension, COPD, CVA, MI, and smoking [20, 21]. Covariates were then controlled for using a hierarchical multivariable logistic regression model. The adjusted risk of failure of NOM and mortality were reported with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We also performed a multivariable regression analysis of octogenarians managed non-operatively for BSI, with the same covariates, to analyze the risk of mortality.

Beginning in 2013, octogenarians were more likely to require splenic angioembolization within the first 48 h of arriving at the emergency department (12.0% vs 2.7%, p = 0.01), compared to the younger GTPs (Table 4). After adjusting for covariates, octogenarians continued to have a higher risk of mortality compared to the younger geriatric cohort after failing NOM (OR 4.99, CI 1.11\u201322.49, p = 0.04) (Table 5). The strongest risk factor of mortality among octogenarians with BSI managed non-operatively, in descending order, were ISS \u2265 25 (OR 3.80, CI 2.81\u20135.13, p < 0.001), thoracic injury with an AIS > 3 (OR 2.13, CI 1.50\u20133.03, p < 0.001), and PRBC transfusion \u2265 1 unit within 24 h (OR 1.88, CI 1.20\u20132.95, p = 0.006). Late failure of NOM was not found to be associated with increased risk of mortality among octogenarians (OR 0.92, CI 0.32\u20132.68, p = 0.88) (Table 6).",

Our data suggest that GTPs were more likely to suffer from MCCs, but had similar rates of falls, MVCs and pedestrian accidents. Octogenarians fail at similar rates to younger GTPs, but when octogenarians fail, they have a fivefold higher risk of mortality, compared to their younger geriatric cohort. Among the octogenarian subgroup, those failing NOM are at a twofold higher risk of mortality compared to those managed successfully with NOM, even after adjusting for ISS.

These rates are significantly improved from prior studies in the early 2000s with failure rates of 11\u201333% [14, 22\u201326]. Our data parallel the most recent studies demonstrating an overall low failure rate among the general geriatric population, less than 7% for patients between 65\u201389 years of age. In addition, we found that octogenarians have a similar rate and risk of failure of NOM of BSI compared to the younger geriatric cohort, despite higher rates of some comorbidities such as CHF and hypertension. Our data suggest risk factors for octogenarians failing NOM include receiving \u2265 1 unit of PRBC, FFP, or platelet transfusions within 4 h. Both FFP and platelet transfusion increase the risk of failure in a stepwise fashion with each additional unit transfused. While it is certain that the transfusion occurs because of the failure of NOM, it suggests that there is no safe level of transfusion requirement in the octogenarian population, as even one unit of transfusion is associated with failure of NOM.",

Geriatric patients failing NOM previously had been demonstrated to have no difference in mortality by Albrecht et al. [14]. Similarly, Trust et al. concluded that no association exists between failing NOM and mortality among GTPs aged 60\u201389 years [18]. However, our data augment the findings of Trust et al. by illustrating a fivefold increased risk of mortality among octogenarians failing NOM. In addition, we identified other risk factors for mortality among octogenarians failing NOM: specifically, one unit or more of PRBC transfusion. This data suggests that when performing NOM for BSI in octogenarians, the managing physician should have a lower threshold for operation, as waiting to operate until a single unit of blood is transfused may be associated with increased mortality in this population.",

Furthermore, there are pertinent missing variables including the severity of splenic injury (e.g., American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade). The use of abdominal AIS is the closest representation to the degree of splenic injury and is tracked by the database; however, concomitant abdominal injuries may account for different AIS scores, thereby this measure may not accurately reflect the degree of injury to the spleen and thus may introduce bias to the study. Other missing pertinent variables include information regarding coagulopathy (i.e., use of antiplatelet or anticoagulants), anemia, and what was the actual clinical trigger for operation. Also, angioembolization intervention was only assessed for half our study population, because TQIP did not begin collecting this data until 2013. This prevented our ability to analyze our entire population for the 2010\u20132016 period of this study; however, our small sample size of data demonstrated increased use of angioembolization in octogenarians which merits future study. In addition, TQIP does not provide ongoing physiologic data or physical examination data (e.g., development of peritonitis). Despite these limitations, this is the first evaluation of octogenarians using a large trauma database over multiple years. We found that octogenarians with more severe injuries and higher grade BSI are at a higher risk of NOM failure and mortality compared to a generalized GTP cohort. Furthermore, our study is strengthened by its generalizability as TQIP encompasses over 800 centers.",
