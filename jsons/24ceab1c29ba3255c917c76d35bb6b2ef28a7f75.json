            "text": "Qatar has one of the highest prevalence estimates of diabetes (17%) in the world, 4 placing a substantial proportion of the population at risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Diabetes in Qatar has an earlier age of disease onset and complications than is seen in western populations. 4 To tackle the serious challenge of COVID-19 and diabetes, Qatar has established a programme to mobilise resources to ensure that people with diabetes are protected through a coordinated collaborative team response across primary and secondary care. People with diabetes have been provided with a helpline to support diabetes care and mental health. An ongoing media campaign for patient guidance on COVID-19 and diabetes has been initiated, reinforced through direct text messages regarding COVID-19 measures, sick day rules, selfmonitoring, medication management, diabetes complications, lifestyle, psychological health, and Ramadan fasting. By use of electronic medical records, patients with poor diabetes control (Glycated haemoglobin A1c >8%) who are treated with insulin and aged older than 50 years will be initially engaged through teleconsultations by physicians and diabetes educators. These teleconsultations aim to improve glycaemic control by diabetes medication optimisation and to reinforce adherence to lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications.",
