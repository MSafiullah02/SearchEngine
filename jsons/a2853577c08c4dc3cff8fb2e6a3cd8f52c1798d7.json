On the microblog, every ID can be seen as a node, and the connection between the different nodes can be seen as an edge. These nodes, edges, and relationships inside form the social network on microblog which belongs to a typical complex network category. Therefore, reviewing the literature from the microblogging marketing angle by the complex network theory can provide a systematic idea to the microblogging marketing research.

Typical epidemic models are the SIR model and the SIS model. Differences lie in that the infected (I) in the SIR model becomes the removed (R) after recovery, so the SIR model is used for immunizable diseases while the infected (I) in the SIS model has no immunity and only becomes the susceptible (S) after recovery. Therefore, the SIS model is used for unimmunizable diseases. These two models developed other epidemic model: SIR model changes to SIRS model when the removed (R) has been the susceptible (S); SIS model changes to SI model presenting the disease outbreaks in a short time when the infected (I) is incurable. Epidemic model can be widely seen in the complex network, such as the dissemination of computer virus [4] , information [5] , knowledge [6] . Guimer\u00e0 et al. finds the hierarchical and community structure in the social network [7] . Due to the hierarchical structure, Barth\u00e9lemy et al. indicate that the disease outbreak followed hierarchical dissemination from the large-node degree group to the small-node degree group [8] . Due to the community structure, Liu et al. indicate the community structure has a lower threshold and greater steady-state density of infection, and is in favor of the infection [9] ; Fu finds that the real interpersonal social network has a positive correlation of the node degree distribution, but the real interpersonal social network has negative [10] . The former expresses circles can be formed in celebrities except grassroots, but the latter expresses contacts can be formed in celebrities and grassroots on the microblog.",

Learning is a critical point to decision-making and game behavior, and equilibrium is the long-term process of seeking the optimal results by irrational individuals [11] . Bala and Goyal draw the \"neighbor effect\" showing the optimal decision-making process based on the historical information from individuals and neighbors [12] . (2) Dynamic evolutionary game model: The formation of the social network seems to be a dynamic outcome due to the strategic choice behavior between edge-breaking and edge-connecting based on the individual evolutionary game [13] . Fu et al. add reputation to the dynamic evolutionary game model and find individuals are more inclined to cooperate with reputable individuals in order to form a stable reputation-based network [14] . (3) Local interaction model: Local network information dissemination model based on the strong interactivity in local community is more practical to community microblogging marketing. Li et al. restrain preferential connection mechanism in a local world and propose the local world evolutionary network model [15] . Burke et al. construct a local interaction model and find individual behavior presents the coexistence of local consistency and global decentrality [16] .",

This is because the online interpersonal social network is more easier for strangers to establish relationships so that that small influence people can reach the big influence people and make weak ties in plenty through breaking the limited range of real world [20] .

Unlike the natural life-like virus, individuals on microblog are bounded rational, therefore, the decisionmaking processes are impacted by not only the neighbor effect and external environment but also by individuals' own values, social experience, and other subjective factors. This creates a unique automatic filtering mechanism of microblogging information dissemination: information recipients reply and retweet the tweet or establish and cancel contact only dependent on their interests, leading to the complexity and diversity. Therefore, interaction-worthy topics are needed in microblogging marketing, and the effective followers' number and not the total followers' number of ID is valuable. This cannot be seen in disease infection.",

            "text": "2. There are differences in network characteristics between microblog network and the real interpersonal social network. On one hand, the interpersonal social network is different from the natural social network in six points: (1) Social network has smaller network diameter and average path length; (2) social network has higher clustering coefficient than the same-scale ER random network; (3) the degree distribution of social network has scale-free feature and follows power-law; (4) interpersonal social network has positive correlation of node degree distribution but natural social network has negative; (5) local clustering coefficient of the given node has negative correlation of the node degree in social network; (6) social network often has clear community structure [23] . Therefore, the results of the natural social network are not all fit for the interpersonal social network. On the other hand, as the online interpersonal social network, microblog has negative correlation of the node degree distribution which is opposite to the real interpersonal social network. This means the results of the real interpersonal social network are not all fit for microblogging marketing. 3. There is still a conversion process from information dissemination to sales achievement in microblogging marketing. Information dissemination on microblog can be explained by the complex network models such as the epidemic model, but the conversion process from information dissemination to sales achievement cannot be simply explained by the complex network theory, due to not only individual's external environment and neighborhood effect, but also consumer's psychology and willingness, payment capacity and convenience, etc.. According to the operational experience, conversion rate, retention rates, residence time, marketing topic design, target group selection, staged operation program, and other factors are needed to be analyzed by other theories.",
