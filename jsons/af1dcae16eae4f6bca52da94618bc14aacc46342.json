This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. Hopefully, this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive treatment against this lethal virus.",

Coronaviruses spike protein are glycoprotein that are embedded over the viral envelope. This spike protein attaches to specific cellular receptors and initiates structural changes of spike protein, and causes penetration of cell membranes which results in the release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cell [3] . The viral spike protein includes N-terminal, which is crucial for identification of Coronaviruses [4] . Coronaviruses have a large RNA genome in the size ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases and capable of obtaining distinct ways of replication [5] . Like all other RNA viruses, coronavirus undergoes replication of genome and transcription of mRNAs upon infection. Synthesis of a full-length negative-strand RNA serves as template for full-length genomic RNA [3] [6] . Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales [7] . that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats [8] . This group of viruses can cause wide varieties of respiratory illness in mammals and birds. In human, it causes common cold, leading to severe illness pneumonia to elderly people and immunocompromised people, like hospital patients [9] . This viral pathogen was responsible for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) and 2019 Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China outbreaks [10] . Coronavirus in form of SARS, MERS and Novel coronavirus are lethal leading to large number of deaths. Coronavirus subfamily is classified into four genera, the alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infections are caused by alpha-and beta-CoV. CoVs are common human pathogens, and 30% to 60% of the Chinese population is positive for anti-CoV antibodies [11] . These viral infections caused by CoV are generally associated the upper respiratory tract to lower respiratory tract. Immunocompromised people like elderly people and infants are more vulnerable and susceptible to this group of viruses [12] .",

Reverse vaccinology approach of vaccine development also allows the scientists to easily understand the antigenic segments of a virus or pathogen that should be given more emphasis during the vaccine development. This method is a quick, cheap, efficient, easy and cost-effective way to design vaccine.

The tumor model was used in prediction because it generated excellent results (when compared to other models) in both the leave-on-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) and external validation in numerous studies. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of a prediction (by the VaxiJen v2.0 server) depends on the prediction accuracy threshold. For this reason, to improve the accuracy of the prediction, the threshold 0.4 was used. The server is a user-friendly web tool for effective prediction of the antigenicity of proteins [106] - [108] . Only the highly antigenic protein sequences were selected for further analysis. Next, the selected antigenic protein sequences were analyzed by ExPASy's online tool and ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) to determine their physicochemical properties i.e., the number of amino acids, theoretical pI, extinction co-efficient, aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) etc. [109] .",

Both the proteins showed quite good results in the physicochemical property analysis. After the physicochemical analysis of the protein sequences, the T-cell and B-cell epitope prediction was conducted. T-cell and B-cell are the two main types of cells that function in immunity. When an antigen is encountered in the body by the immune system, the antigen presenting cells or APC like macrophage, dendritic cell etc. present the antigen to the T-helper cell, through the MHC class-II molecules on their surface. The helper T-cell contains CD4+ molecule on its surface, for this reason, it is also known as CD4+ T-cell. On the other hand, other type of T-cell, cytotoxic T-cell contains CD8+ molecule on their surface, for which, they are called CD8+ T-cell. MHC class-I molecules present antigens to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. After activation by the antigen, the T-helper cell activates the B-cell, which starts to produce large amount of antibodies.

The highest theoretical pI of CV-1 indicated that it requires high pH to reach the isoelectric point. Quite similar results of extinction co-efficient were generated by the three vaccine constructs. The three vaccine construct showed quite good and similar results in the physicochemical property analysis.The secondary structure of the vaccine constructs determined that CV-1 had the shortest alphahelix formation, with 25% of the amino acids in the alpha-helix formation, however, 67.1% of the amino acids in coil formation. For this reason, most of the amino acid acids of CV-1 vaccine was predicted to be in coil structure, which was also the highest percentage of amino acids in coil structure among the three vaccines. On the other hand, CV-3 had the highest amount of amino acids in the alpha-helix formation (37.8%), according to the prediction by the study. However, all the three vaccine constructs had most of their amino acids in their coil structures. In the tertiary structure prediction, all the three vaccine construction showed quite satisfactory results. In the tertiary structure refinement and validation, CV-1 vaccine construct generated the best result with 94.3% of the amino acids in the most favored region and 4.4% of the amino acids in the additional allowed regions. CV-2 also showed good result 90.0% of the amino acids in the most favoured region. In the disulfide bond engineering experiment, only CV-1 was found to follow the selection criteria for disulfide bond formation. With the lowest and best results generated by the MM-GBSA study, HawkDock server and ClusPro 2.0 server, CV-1 was considered as the best vaccine construct among the three vaccines. For this reason, CV-1 was selected for molecular dynamics simulation study, codon adaptation and in silico coding study. The molecular dynamics simulation study was conducted by the online tool iMODS (http://imods.chaconlab.org/) revealed that the TLR-8-CV-1 docked complex should be quite stable with a good eigenvalue of 3.817339e-06. The complex had less chance of deformation and for this reason, the complex should be quite stable in the biological environment. TheFigure 10fshows that a good number of amino acids were in the correlated motion that were marked by red color. Finally, codon adaptation and in silico cloning experiments were performed and with the predicted CAI value of 1.0, it could be concluded that the DNA sequence should have very high amount of favorable codons that should be able to express the desired amino acids in the target microorganism, E. coli strain K12. The DNA sequence also had quite high and good amount of GC content of 51.34%. Finally, the pET-19b vector, containing the CV-1 vaccine insert was constructed which should efficiently and effectively encode the vaccine protein in the E. coli cells.The vaccine development using genome based technologies provides scientists the opportunity to develop vaccines by optimizing the target antigens. Conventional vaccines, like the attenuated vaccines or the inactivated vaccines sometimes fail to provide potential immunity towards a target antigen. Moreover, the conventional approach of vaccine development have raised many safety concerns in many pre-clinical and clinical trials. The subunit vaccines like the vaccines predicted",

On 1 st February the death toll reached to 258 with 11,948 confirmed cases worldwide stated by Hubei Provincial Health Commission [67][68]. On the same day German Ministry of Health said that a military airplane landed at Frankfurt airport after evacuating 128 German citizens from Wuhan who will be quarantined till mid of February and the health minister also stated that Germany military aircraft delivered aid and 1000 protective suits to Chinese authorities requested by China [69].First known fatality outside China reported of a 44 year old man in Philippines by Philippine health officials on 2 nd February as the novel coronavirus outbreak took 362 lives and 17,205 cases were reported according to Chinese and World Health Organization data [70][71].The Nation's flagship carrier, Qantas , was chartered by Australian government and the airplane landed in Learmonth, Western Australia after evacuating 243 citizens including 89 children on 3 rd February from where the citizens would be sent by another flight to Christmas Island to be quarantined [72]. New 1000-bed facility Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan is built in only 10 days to mitigate the pressure of patients in other medical hospitals in Wuhan. A crew of more than 7000 workers started working around the clock on 24 January which covers 60000 square meters with special quarantine area and opened its door to receive patients on 3 rd February [73][74]. Kerala government announced the third confirmed case in India on 3 rd February who is a student [75] just like the 1 st case (reported on 30 th January in Kerala) and 2 nd case (reported on 2 nd February in Kerala) according to the Ministry of Health and Family welfare of India [76][77]. A British pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) stated on 3 rd February that they would like to collaborate with Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) that works for developing vaccines. GSK said that they are ready to work with their adjuvant technology to increase immunity to the patients as well as to develop vaccine for coronavirus outbreak Health authorities in China stated on 4 th February that as end of 3 rd February the coronavirus fatalities jumped to 425 in China and 427 worldwide as the second fatality announced in Hong Kong of a 39 year old man reported on same day in the early morning [75][78]. The authority also said that the confirmed cases reached to 20,438 worldwide [79][80]. COVID-19 claimed second death of a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong, outside mainland China on 4th February, 2020 [81]. On 5th February, 2020 a Japanese cruise ship, docked at Yokohama, Japan called Diamond Princess was quarantined for two weeks by Health officials after the disembarked Hong Kong citizen tested positive of virus which started it's round trip carrying 3711 individuals on board including 2666 passengers and 1045 crew members",

Since the different portions of the MHC molecules are encoded by different MHC alleles, the constructed vaccines should have very good binding affinity towards these segments of the MHC complex[150]. In this experiment, all 2SEB), and DRB1*0301 (PDB ID: 3C5J) alleles. Moreover, it has been proved that TLR-8 is responsible for mediating the immune responses against the RNA viruses and TLR-3 is responsible for mediating immune responses against the DNA viruses [151][152]. The coronavirus is an RNA virus[153]. For this reason, the vaccine constructs of Wuhan novel coronavirus were docked against TLR-8 (PDB ID: 3W3M). The protein-protein docking study was conducted using different online docking tools to improve the prediction accuracy of the docking study. At first, the docking was performed by ClusPro 2.0 (https://cluspro.bu.edu/login.php). The server ranks the docked complexes based on their center scores and lowest energy scores[154]-[156]. The binding affinity (\u0394G in kcal mol -1 ) of the docked complexes were later analyzed by PRODIGY tool of HADDOCK webserver (https://haddock.science.uu.nl/). The lower binding energy of the server represents the higher binding affinity and vice versa[157]-[159]. Next, the docking was again carried out by PatchDock (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php) server and later refined and re-scored by FireDock server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/php.php). The FireDock server ranks the docked complexes based on their global energy and the lower global energy represents the better result. Finally, the docking was conducted using HawkDock server (http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/hawkdock/). At this stage, the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) study was also calculated by the HawkDock server which works on",
