And as specialists, emergency physicians and nurses excel at providing this care to some of the most fragile patients anywhere. But we are not experts at providing ongoing, inpatient care. We are not, by and large, trained to do this; our processes and environment are not designed to facilitate this; and our staffing is not funded to support this. Every minute that an ED nurse spends drawing daily blood tests and providing medications for a \u201cboarded\u201d inpatient is a minute he or she is not spending providing care for a new ED patient.

Admittedly, such an approach is not the answer for all admitted patients; those requiring respiratory isolation, for instance, represent as much of a risk on a ward hallway as they do in an ED hallway. However, at least this serves to reduce the number of admitted patients in the ED so that staff is better able to provide care to those \u201cboarded\u201d patients for whom ward hallway placement is inappropriate.",

At the outset of their program of reform in early 2002, this target was being achieved only 77% of the time. By 2004, more than 96% of ED patients in England spent less than 4 hours in the ED regardless of disposition.8 To achieve this remarkable degree of success, changes were required at all levels of the system, from the community and the emergency medical services system to ED processes themselves, through to the inpatient units and post\u2013acute care system and back to the community.",
