Therefore, disinfection of pathological microbes in water is very important to provide a sanitary environment and thus maintain human health [1], [2]. A variety of chemical and physical techniques may be used for such disinfections. The most widely used methods in water treatment systems are chlorination, ozonation and germicidal lamps (UV) [3], [4], [5]. However, there are some disadvantages associated with each of the method. For example, potential formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts \u2013 chloroform and bromate, has been reported as a drawback of chlorination and ozonation.",

Generally, TiO2 based bactericidal materials need UV light or ultrasonic irradiation to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) [3], [5]. On the other hand, silver nanoparticles and compounds containing silver are attractive because of their strong antibacterial activity, high stability, and wide antibacterial spectrum without any energy input [1], [6], [7], [8], [9]. However, so far, the mechanism underlying the bactericidal activity of silver loaded materials remains generally unclear [1], [8]. Some reports have suggested that the antibacterial activity of silver loaded materials is realized via the elution of silver ions into the system containing microorganisms, leading to cell death through cell penetration and binding at specific sites to DNA, RNA, respiratory enzymes and cellular protein [10], [11], [12]. Others attribute the bactericidal activity of silver loaded materials to catalytic oxidation involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1], [6], [7], [8].",

The microbes are completely inactivated in 5 min on Ag/Al2O3 surface at room temperature in air. We have proposed a catalytic oxidation mechanism that ROS as bactericide in the bactericidal process are formed on the catalyst surface by activating adsorbed oxygen in air [9], [13]. In this paper, we focus our attention on the bactericidal activity of Ag/Al2O3 in water to further identify the inactivation mechanism as a successive work to the former study [13], since the situation is very different from that in air. AgCl/Al2O3 was also used in this study because of its low amount of eluted Ag+, and thus is applicable to water resources without having adverse health effects. The objective of this study is to confirm the catalytic disinfection mechanism and primarily investigate the feasibility of this material in water.",

Under the control condition, the viable cell numbers were counted without the addition of any catalyst (shown in Fig. 1a). It was clearly observed that in the presence of Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 the E. coli in the suspension was completely inactivated after only 30 min and 60 min, respectively. Silver supported alumina catalysts were so effective that the surviving E. coli cells decreased sharply even in the first 10 min. However, with Al2O3 addition, the viable cell count was similar to that in the control even after 60 min. This means that the adsorption of E. coli on alumina is negligible, and the dramatic decrease in E. coli survival is ascribed to the highly efficient bactericidal activity of Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3.",

The quantitative analysis of eluted silver ions by ICP-AES showed that there was 0.897 mg/L Ag+ and 0.081 mg/L Ag+ eluted from Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3, respectively, when the catalysts were immerged singly in deionized water in the absence of E. coli for 60 min. As shown in Fig. 1d and e, Ag/Al2O3 with the larger amount of Ag+ actually exhibited stronger bactericidal activity than AgCl/Al2O3, which implied that Ag+ may play an important role in the bactericidal process. However, the bactericidal activity of 1 mg/L Ag+ (shown in Fig. 1c) was much lower than either of the catalysts, indicating that the effect of Ag+ alone cannot completely explain the bactericidal activity.",

In physiological saline, the cells swelled to a much larger size than the untreated ones, and the cell envelope of E. coli was significantly damaged from the top of the cell (shown in Fig. 2c and d), resulting in leakage of the intracellular ingredients. This phenomenon was similar to that of E. coli cells damaged by H2O2, as reported by Shin et al. [21]. For the cells treated in deionized water (shown in Fig. 2e and f), the whole cells completely disappeared, and nothing was observed except for a large number of fibriform cell pieces. Furthermore, some electron-dense granules adherent to the fibriform pieces can be clearly observed (arrows in Fig. 2e and f). As reported by Feng et al. [20], some of the stimulated proteins produced by the cells would agglomerate after the attack by silver ions, surrounding the nuclear region. Further investigation indicated that the DNA molecules became condensed like a twisted string losing their replication abilities. According to these conclusions, the fibriform cell pieces observed in Fig. 2e and f were possibly due to lysis of the bacterial cells leading to leakage of damaged DNA molecules [22]. This implies that a stronger oxidizing intermediate was formed to destroy the cells more thoroughly.",

Therefore, K+ leakage from E. coli was used in this work to further examine the permeability of the cell membrane.

The K+ concentration increased remarkably with increasing time, which should be attributed to a notable change in the structure of the cell wall (see Fig. 2f). The K+ level reached relatively steady values after 60 min, when 100% cell damage was achieved (see Fig. 1d).

This suggested that ROS generated on the catalyst surface is an essential factor for the expression of the bactericidal activity in the presence of catalysts [1], [8]. The same conclusion was reached in deionized water by our previous work [6], [9]. However, without the presence of Ag+, the bactericidal activity decreased in physiological saline even under aerobic conditions, compared with that in deionized water (Fig. 1d and e). Furthermore, the bactericidal activities of Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 did not show a sharp difference and were still stronger than that of the Al2O3 host.

This result indicates that the formation of H2O2 play an important role during the bactericidal process. The addition of catalase had two effects [1]: one was transformation of H2O2 to water, the other was interception of the route of formation of \u2022OH, because \u2022OH was formed by the decomposition of H2O2. As have been reported [1], [8], the transitional metals, such as silver and ferric ions could catalyze the oxidizing action of H2O2 by forming \u2022OH and/or O2\u2212, through a so-called Fenton-like reaction. As a result, \u2022OH and other ROS such as O2\u2212 and H2O2, simultaneously contribute to the efficient inactivation of E. coli cells.",

This may be the reason why the time required for complete inactivation by the catalyst in physiological saline was much longer than that in deionized water. Since the combined use of H2O2 and Ag+ exhibited improved bactericidal effects compared to H2O2 and Ag+ alone [27], [28], [29], the simultaneous presence of H2O2 and Ag+ in deionized water could adequately explain the much higher bactericidal activity compared with that in physiological saline. We supposed that H2O2 was first formed on the catalyst surface by activating adsorbed O2, then H2O2 was further catalyzed to a stronger ROS (\u2022OH, etc.) by eluted Ag+. Since the quantitative analysis of the generated ROS is complex, an indirect method by \u2022OH scavenger was used to prove the production of ROS.",

In order to dissociate the effect of the pH modification on bacteria from the specific impact of the bactericidal process by AgCl/Al2O3, HNO3 or NaOH was directly added to the bacterial suspension in the absence of AgCl/Al2O3, adjusting the pH value to the similar range as the control experiments.",

Furthermore, the bactericidal activity did not increase obviously from 6.0 to 8.0 of the pH value. Since the charges of the catalyst and bacteria are both closely related to pH value, zeta potentials of the bacteria and AgCl/Al2O3 were determined at various pH values as shown in Fig. 8b. Though the surface of the bacteria was positively charged and the surface of the catalyst was negatively charged in the range of pH 3.0\u20135.5, the bactericidal activity of the catalyst was quite low in acidic condition as shown in Fig. 8a. On the other hand, in the range of pH 5.5\u201312, the surface of the bacteria and catalyst were both negatively charged, whereas the bactericidal activity of the catalyst was high when pH > 6.0 as shown in Fig. 8a.

The higher the pH value was, the more rapid decomposition of H2O2 was, and the stronger the catalytic oxidation ability was. All these results could well explain the higher bactericidal activity of AgCl/Al2O3 at higher pH value, since the involvement of H2O2 has also been observed in our experiment as mentioned above (see Fig. 5). However, when the pH value was too high, the formation of H2O2 (pK\na\n = 11.56) was blocked, and the catalytic oxidation ability would not increase any more [35]. It solidly confirmed the catalytic oxidation mechanism mediated by different kind of ROS. Furthermore, the high bactericidal activity in neutral condition suggested that this catalyst is a very potential material to apply in drinking water disinfection.",

The fixed silver species and/or eluted Ag+ strongly enhanced the bactericidal activity of the catalyst by catalyzing adsorbed O2 to ROS, such as H2O2, \u2022OH and O2\u2212. ROS with strongly oxidizing properties resulted in destruction of the cell wall of the bacteria and finally the complete lysis of the bacterial cell. The catalytically bactericidal effect should be considered as a synergic action of ROS and Ag+, not as an additive one. Since the bactericidal activity of the catalyst increased with temperature increasing, and showed good performance at neutral pH value condition in water, it may provide a novel approach for the design of other bactericidal materials applied in drinking water disinfection. Further study and direct proof of ROS are needed to clarify the details of these actions.",
