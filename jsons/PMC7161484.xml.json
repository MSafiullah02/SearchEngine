Based on these landmark reports, in 2003, the IOM called for health system transformation through interprofessional, evidence-based care, including expert clinical leadership by nurses. Given the growing complexity of care, and strong recommendations by the IOM, it was held that healthcare would benefit from doctorate-educated practitioners. Around this same time, other disciplines, such as pharmacy and physical therapy, echoed this belief and moved their disciplines to a practice doctorate exit.",

Many nursing schools kept up robust MSN enrollment and only added the post-MSN DNP, which did not require extensive investment in clinical sites and could be delivered to large numbers of students online. This \u2018add-on\u2019 approach neglected the practice component of the DNP, sidestepping one of its central purposes as a practice doctorate. Many of the post-master's DNP programs were designed for working nurse executives and practicing APRNs; these programs often did not include clinical hours at all, but rather allocated hours to the capstone or final project. The 500 additional project hours were often used to develop leadership initiatives and were not primarily designed to increase APRN clinical proficiency. In fact, some post-master's DNP programs admitted students holding MSN degrees outside of advanced practice nursing altogether. Meanwhile, the number of APRN students opting for master's-level practice entry continued to rise from 10,737 in 2004 to 46,622 in 2018 (unpublished data, AACN, 2019).\nFigure 2\nshows that only 152 master's programs closed between 2008 and 2018 (unpublished data, AACN, 2019).",

The original intent for DNP curricula was to prepare a workforce of leaders in advanced clinical practice; however, the decade of fast growth in post-master's DNP programs produced a majority of first-wave graduates opting for positions in administrative and educational settings instead (AACN, 2004; AACN, 2012; Grey, 2013). Out of the 7,039 DNP graduates in 2018, 4,232 (60%) entered full-time positions in schools of nursing, rather than bedside or clinical positions (AACN, 2019c). With almost five DNP graduates per year for every nursing PhD graduate, the DNP offered a quick way for schools to increase their proportion of doctorate-prepared faculty. While this wave of DNP graduates has helped to ease the perennial shortage of nursing faculty, to an extent, it has not counted toward the number of doctorate-prepared APRNs needed to address the national primary care shortage.",

In recent years, the proportion of DNP students enrolling in post-master's DNP programs seems to be declining. In 2015, enrollments in post-BSN programs exceeded post-MSN enrollments for the first time, and post-BSN DNP program enrollment increased nearly 18-fold from 1,060 students in 2009 to 18,240 in 2018 (unpublished data, AACN, 2019). If enrollment trends correspond to graduation trends, we can predict that the largest number of DNP graduates soon will come from post-BSN cohorts. This progress contrasts starkly with where we were a decade ago, when there were 30 post-MSN DNP graduates for every post-BSN DNP graduate. This trend suggests that the profession might finally be gaining the buy-in it needs\u2014at least from students\u2014to implement the DNP standard as it was intended. Nursing leaders should apply this momentum towards enacting long-awaited professional changes, such as updated accreditation and certification standards, while also accounting for the real-world challenges that accompany DNP implementation.",

However, the number of online post-baccalaureate DNP programs that focus on health system leadership and offer no advanced practice skills has risen, and post-MSN students are still opting for leadership tracks primarily.

This situation is similar to the decades-old challenge of stating that the BSN should be the practice-entry degree for nursing, while retaining one licensing exam for both associate- and BSN-prepared graduates.

This stance has been taken without substantive evidence that the MSN prepared workforce is more diverse than the DNP workforce.

Employers were unable to differentiate between preparations due to several factors: a lack of DNP-specific positions in their organizations, limited employment of DNP-prepared nurses, and/or the fact that DNPs were too new to organizations to be accurately evaluated. Employers did, however, report that DNPs exhibited a better understanding of evidence-based clinical guidelines, a greater focus on translation of evidence into practice, and stronger knowledge of health policy, compared to master's-level APRNs (Beeber et al., 2019). This underscores the need for nursing leaders to gain consensus on what makes the DNP different, to methodically disseminate that information to health system stakeholders, and to adjust their evaluation criteria accordingly.",

For instance:\u2022Their health policy and leadership foundation means DNPs may counsel metro, state, and national leaders in strategic mechanisms for virus containment.\u2022DNP graduates have completed coursework involving assessments of the most up-to-date technologies available to providers. That means they will be ready to apply emerging technologies, in clever ways, to solve new problems. For instance, DNP-educated APRNs, with their focus on population health, would be well suited to coordinate central response command centers for mass telehealth screenings.\u2022This population health perspective also lends itself to the collection, analysis, and reporting of epidemiological data using novel methods. For example, the self-screening app TechTank COVID-19 PRO was recently co-created by a DNP-prepared nurse. This smartphone app allows patients to self-screen for COVID-19, and enables providers to view real-time positive screening counts by zip code. Providers may then utilize in-app resources to develop locally tailored containment and mitigation strategies (Bussenius et al., 2020).\u2022Specialized DNPs, such as gerontological APRNs, can help systems tailor protocols to triage and treat patients across the lifespan; they may also evaluate system migrations to telehealth while considering specialized population needs. This is especially important given that people over 65 are at higher risk for complications and morbidity related to COVID-19, compared to other demographics.\n",
