Annually, 1.7 million hospital\u2010acquired infections (HAI) are reported in the United States, resulting in 99,000 deaths and an increased cost to the national health care system of US$20 billion (CDC, 2018a). Many of these can be prevented by compliance with recommended disinfecting protocols. Disease outbreaks in recent years are more severe due to global travel, large scale food processing, adaptation of microorganisms, and reduced vaccination rates (CDC, 2018b). Natural disasters in recent years have had a more severe impact, particularly when large metropolitan areas are affected. These events may disrupt water, sanitation, healthcare access, and hygiene practices; in addition, those who require sheltering during and after such events are at higher risk for illness due to crowded conditions (Watson et al., 2007).",

It is estimated that illnesses cost the US economy $273B in lost producitivity (Forbes, 2018).

The key features that distinguish gram\u2010positive bacteria from gram\u2010negative bacteria are: a thick peptidoglycan layer; the presence of teichoic acids (copolymers of glycerol phosphate and carbohydrates) and lipids (together, these form lipoteichoic acids, which serve as chelators and also aid in adherence to the cell wall) (Brown et al., 2013; Percy et al., 2014); the crosslinking by DD\u2010transpeptidase of peptidoglycan chains to form rigid cell walls; and a much smaller volume of periplasm than that in Gram\u2010negative bacteria (Madigan et al., 2006). Some gram\u2010positive bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile, form spores. The stabilized spore coat proteins have been studied by Permpoonpattana et al.

The resulting polymeric matrix protects the microbes from attack, including that of antimicrobials, and can enable survival of bacteria outside a host for extended periods of time (Hokkanson, 2018). Penetration of this matrix is key to killing. It can be done through additional chemical attack and/or physical disruption. Biofilm contamination can be a key issue with plumbing, food and water handling systems, and medical devices, and can cause health issues such as gingivitis, eye infections from contaminated contact lenses, and middle\u2010ear and urinary tract infections (Rogers, 2008).",

As amphoteric materials, at acidic pH, they can take on a positive charge, thus yielding stronger affinity for cell membranes provided the cell membrane isoelectric point is not achieved. Birnie et al. (2000) notes efficacy against S. aureus and E. coli, with best performance at myristic or palmitic (C14\u2013C16) chain lengths. Krasowska et al. (2012) notes that a synergy in antimicrobial performance was found between cocoamidopropyl betaine and alkyl dimethyl amine oxide; however, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the blend was still much higher than that of benzalkonium chloride. Subik et al. (1977) found that heterocyclic amine oxides demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Bacillus, yeast, and molds; the inhibitory concentration decreased with increasing alkyl chain length, indicating that the longer chain lengths appear to interact more strongly with the cell membrane.",

Through case studies, it was demonstrated that surfactants aid in the killing of microbes that cause illness. Examples of microefficacy have been demonstrated in all major surfactant classes, but not all surfactants will demonstrate microefficacy, not all microbes will be equally susceptible to surfactants, and structural differences in a particular surfactant type can have an impact on antimicrobial efficacy. Microefficacy may also vary with formulation variables such as pH and ionic strength. Formulators who seek antimicrobial claims on disinfecting products should consult local regulations for the appropriate testing methodologies and requirements for making claims. This article, as it was derived from a conference presentation, is not intended to be a full review of this topic, but an overview to guide those formulating antimicrobial cleaning products for inanimate surfaces.",
