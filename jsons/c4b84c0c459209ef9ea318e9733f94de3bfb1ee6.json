All of these modes of transmission could occur in a crowded aircraft cabin. Aerosol-transmitted diseases are generally caused by agents that are resistant to environmental stresses, and diseases that lead to environmental release of agent-containing secretions.

The exception to this is, of course, bioterrorism, for which an inanimate reservoir may have been prepared. The probability that an infected person will be in the environment is related to the incidence of the disease in the population likely to be in the environment.

Needless to say, the closer one is to the source, the greater the risk of sufficient exposure to cause illness.

Thus, common colds, influenza, tuberculosis, and measles have been spread on aircraft, and many cases have probably occurred that have gone unreported because of follow up failures. The rare or newly emergent diseases are much less likely to be present on aircraft. On the other hand, follow up is likely to be intensive, so that these are over-reported in relation to the more common illnesses. In addition, there is the problem of separating infections acquired in flight from those acquired at other points in travel [3] . Thus it is impossible to say whether or not a specific case of the common cold was contracted while staying away from home, on the airplane going to or from home, or, in fact, at home before travel began.
