An obvious intervention to limit the contact transmission of HAIs is to remove microorganisms from the surfaces and hands, such as through surface cleaning and hand hygiene. And these interventions have been shown to have impact on controlling HAIs [3\u20135].",

In this study, similarly to previous work [14], we approach this problem using a mathematical model describing the concentration dynamics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on environmental surfaces and hands, but now consider a 6-bed intensive care unit (ICU) with a more realistic system of surfaces contacted by patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). We used this model to investigate how contact heterogeneity on hospital environmental surfaces may influence the exposure of susceptible patients to MRSA via the contact route, given non-compliance with surface cleaning.",

Near-patient surfaces (NPSs) are typically touched only by each patient and the HCWs that care for that patient, and include: the bedrail, bed surfaces and overbed table, etc. The NPSs were subdivided based on the rate of contacts by HCWs reported by Huslage et al. [6] into HTSs, medium-touch surfaces (MTSs) and low-touch surfaces (LTSs). As a result, for each patient, there were three kinds of NPSs (HTSs, MTSs, and LTSs). In total, 20 environmental surface compartments were included in the model: 1 CSs, 1 CE, 6 HTSs, 6 MTSs and 6 LTSs. Since our primary interest is the contribution of each type of surface to MRSA transmission, we did not further subdivide the five surface types.

However the compliance with hand hygiene is poor [29, 30]. We assumed HCWs would clean their hands after 42% of healthcare visits with patients, which is the average hand hygiene compliance rate observed in 12 studies conducted in ICUs (Additional file 1: Part A.

After each hand hygiene, only a fraction (1\u201390%) of MRSA remains on hands.

These pathogens are always readily transmitted from environmental surfaces to HCWs\u2019 and patients\u2019 hands [7]. Surface cleaning has at least two impacts. First, it reduces the surface pathogen contamination level, which means that fewer pathogen is present to be transmitted to the susceptible patients during contact with hospital surfaces. Secondly, it reduces the HCW\u2019s hand contamination level, and then controls the pathogen transmission from HCW-to-patient. A randomized crossover field study in an ICU found that enhanced cleaning in the near-patient environment significantly reduced the number of MRSA isolates in the environment and on the hands of the HCWs [32].",

This trend was also observed in a field study in a 10-bed adult ICU, in which the bioburden on five near-patient surfaces was linearly associated with the frequency of hand contacts [21]. Theoretical work in network modeling has also shown that disease spread more easily among highly connected individuals [33]. According to the modeling study, the absolute MRSA concentration on the nares of susceptible patients was low, particularly compared to the index patient, this is because it was assumed that the MRSA on each compartment is uniformly distributed in the model.

It is already known that traditional communal surfaces such as toilets, floor and sinks tend to attract high rates of cleaning [35], while near-patient hand-touch sites such as bed rail, overbed table and bedside table, are not always well cleaned [36, 37]. The responsibility for cleaning near-patient hand-touch sites has been found to fall to nurses, who are typically very busy and may be unable to perform this task consistently [38].

Firstly, this study used MRSA as an example of contract-transmissible pathogens relevant to healthcare settings, and used MRSA-specific values for model parameters and assumptions, which may be generalizable to other pathogens. For example, the assumption that no MRSA was released directly onto communal surfaces may be reasonable for some respiratory infections, such as influenza and SARS, but is not reasonable for norovirus, which is released into communal areas (washrooms) in diarrhea and vomit. In this context, cleaning of communal washroom surfaces should be very important in preventing the norovirus transmission via the contact route. The assumption about no emission to communal surfaces, may therefore overemphasize the importance of near-patient sites for some nosocomial pathogens transmitted via the contact route. In addition, this study also did not consider other source of pathogens, such as mobile contamination by healthcare workers. Second, in determining the pathogen transfer efficiency from one type of surface to hand and the reverse direction, the surfaces are all thought to be non-porous surfaces. This is due to most surfaces in UIC are non-porous surfaces. However, there still are some porous surfaces in hospital, such as bed surfaces and clothes. The relative low pathogen transfer efficiency from porous surface to hand and relative high pathogen transfer efficiency from hand to porous surface may lead much pathogen harbour on the bed surfaces, then the cleaning of HTSs (bed surface is one HTS in our model) in reality may be more important than we obtained in this study. Finally, the ODEs model we used in this study could provide a good approximation of the average behaviors in large scale settings, but may not be applicable in all situations.",

The pathogen concentration on patient nearby high-touch surfaces were found to be linearly associated with the contact frequencies, and therefore, the high-touch surfaces should be cleaned more carefully during the daily surface hygiene. The findings of this study contribute to the development of targeted surface cleaning strategies. The model and associated approaches could also be applied to other pathogens in indoor environments.",
