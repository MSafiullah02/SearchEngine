The tests are intended for use in the field and, longer term, for home use. They detect whether a subject is currently infected with the virus and is infectious. The urgent need for large numbers of tests in field setting imposes constraints such as short test time and lack of access to specialist equipment, laboratories and skilled technicians to perform the test and interpret results. To meet these needs, an antigen test based on RT-LAMP with colorimetric readout was chosen. Direct use of swab sample with no RNA extraction was explored. After extensive experimental study (reported elsewhere), a rapid test kit has been fabricated to satisfy all design criteria.",

RT-PCR test takes 90-120 min per sample set, while LAMP can be completed with 30 min.

The RT-PCR method is the 'gold standard' test and widely used worldwide. It involves RNA extraction from the patient swab solution followed by reverse transcription of the RNA and then PCR expansion of the cDNA. The whole process can be automated and high-throughput testing can be performed, which makes it ideal for central test laboratories. However, it is not suitable for field use as it depends on a PCR machine, a laboratory environment for RNA extraction and skilled operators. Additionally, the surge for PCR reagents has created a global shortage of reagents supplies and has limited the test capacities of many test centres. RT-LAMP can detect both RNA and RNA fragments and can deliver the result much faster with easy operation of isothermal amplification of DNA at 65\u00b0C [4] . Thus, LAMP is an obvious choice for its shorter running time as well as the fact that it usually has a lower detection limit. We could take advantage of this and remove the RNA extraction step. If possible, this would greatly simplify the test.",
