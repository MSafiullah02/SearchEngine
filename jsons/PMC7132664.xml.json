This study was part of a series of gap analysis surveys pertaining to HID mitigation and management for workers outside hospital settings and designed with the death care sector26 and medical waste industry gap analysis surveys.27 Two nearly identical electronic surveys (the only difference being personal pronouns), each composed of 48 questions, were administered at the supervisor/lead/management level (Lead) and the worker/member/frontline responder (Frontline) level. Participants selected which survey they believed most appropriate based on job position and were not assigned a specific survey upon distribution. National and local EMS and EMT organizations\u2014International Association of EMS Chiefs, National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Infection Control/Emergency Concepts, Inc\u2014sent the anonymous link to the surveys to e-mail lists of collectively 108,800 individuals; 2 follow-up e-mail messages were sent over a 3-week period to solicit further participation. The survey links were closed after 30 days.",

In line with that, a section could be included specifically directed at volunteer EMS practitioners to gauge their desire to expand HID training and education. Additionally, a future study could focus on geographic locations\u2014perhaps in larger cities with an existing high-level isolation unit or designated regional EVD and other special pathogens treatment center to determine whether those areas have more robust training and education programs pertaining to HIDs.",

            "text": "This research suggests that EMS practitioners could benefit from enhanced, up-to-date industry-specific education, training, and planning on HID mitigation and management. Due to the variations among state licensure models, there is a need for cohesive and comprehensive curricula as well as mandatory HID standards to be implemented at the national level to increase EMS practitioner knowledge and readiness. Enhancing EMS practitioner preparedness and response to suspected or confirmed HID scenarios can not only bolster patient care, but also occupational health and safety, as well as community safety.3 Several simultaneous strategies were suggested to accomplish the aforesaid, including regularly posted information on EMS national organization Web sites, organizational changes that promote increased communication about HIDs and safety culture, expanding upon existing training guidelines, and using existing national training resources.34, 39 For US EMS, improving practitioner education and training may result in enhanced preparation, capability, willingness, and comfort to respond to potential HID scenarios.",
