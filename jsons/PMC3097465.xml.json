The complement system consists of more than 30 proteins that are either present as soluble proteins in the blood or are present as membrane-associated proteins. Activation of complement leads to a sequential cascade of enzymatic reactions (known as complement activation pathways; see below) resulting in the formation of the potent anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a that elicit a plethora of physiological responses that range from chemoattraction to apoptosis. Initially, complement was thought to play a major role in innate immunity where a robust and rapid response is mounted against invading pathogens. However, recently, it is becoming increasingly evident that complement also plays an important role in adaptive immunity involving T and B cells that help in elimination of pathogens (Dunkelberger and Song 2010; Molina et al. 1996) and in maintaining immunologic memory preventing pathogenic re-invasion. Not only is complement involved in innate and adaptive immunity but it is also involved in tissue regeneration, tumor growth (Qu et al. 2009) and human pathological states such a atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, age-related macular degeneration, etc. (Wagner and Frank 2010).",

C3 is constantly hydrolyzed at a low level (\u201ctick over\u201d) to form C3b, which binds to targets such as bacteria. Factor B is then recruited to the bound C3b followed by Factor D that cleaves Factor B to form the C3 convertase C3bBb, which is stabilized by the presence of plasma properdin (Kemper et al. 2010). Properdin is a protein released by activated neutrophils (properdin is also found in macrophages and T cells) and which stabilizes the convertase by binding to C3b and preventing its cleavage by Factors H and I. Recent studies suggest that properdin can directly bind to apoptotic and necrotic cells and initiate complement activation (Kemper et al. 2010).",

            "text": "The lectin pathway (LP) is activated when either mannose binding lectin (MBL) or Ficolin bind to carbohydrate moieties on surfaces of pathogens including yeast, bacteria, parasites and viruses. Both MBL and Ficolin circulate in the serum as complexes with MBL-associated proteins (MASPs; Wallis 2007; S\u00f8rensen et al. 2005). There are four structurally related MASPs: 1, 2 and 3 and a truncated MASP2 known as MAP19 (S\u00f8rensen et al. 2005). Binding to pathogens induces conformational changes resulting in autoactivation of MASP2 which cleaves C4 to form C4a and C4b. C4b attaches to the surface of the pathogens inducing C2 to bind, which is in turn cleaved by MASP2 to form C2b and C2a. C4b together with the attached C2a has enzymatic activity and forms the LP C3 convertase C4bC2a. The exact role of the other MASPs is presently unknown although MASP1 can cleave C2 but not C4 (Wallis 2007) and thus help in enhancing complement activation by the bound complexes.",

They act as potent chemoattractants for cells such as phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes) to sites of injury or inflammation. They act as vasodilators and induce smooth muscle contraction. They cause histamine release from mast cells and induce oxidative bursts (consumption of O2) from neutrophils. They are implicated in the production of the cytokine, TNF\u03b1, during liver regeneration (Markiewski et al. 2006). C3a and C5a exert pleiotropic effects by binding to their respective receptors, namely C3aR and, in the case of C5a, to two receptors, C5aR and C5a receptor-like 2 receptor (C5L2). C5L2 was discovered in 2000 (Ohno et al. 2000) and, although it shares homology with C5aR, its exact biologic function remains unclear.",

Originally, C5aR was presumed to be expressed exclusively on myeloid cells but now there is ample evidence that it can be expressed on a variety of non-myeloid cells (Wetsel 1995). Under inflammatory conditions, expression of C5aR increases in lung endothelial, alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages (Laudes et al. 2002; Riedemann et al. 2002). The recently identified C5L2 receptor for C5a is also a seven-transmembrane spanning rhodopsin family receptor. Abundant expression of C5L2 has been found on neutrophils and dendritic cells (Ohno et al. 2000). Unlike C3aR and C5aR, C5L2 is uncoupled from G-proteins due to an amino-acid replacement of arginine by leucine in the DRY region at the end of the third intra-cellular transmembrane loop (Cain and Monk 2002). Following binding of C5a, C5L2 does not induce classical signaling (induction of intracellular calcium transients) or cause biological cellular responses. The role of C5L2 is largely unknown. It may act as a decoy or scavenger receptor for C5a (Okinaga et al. 2003; Scola et al. 2009). However, recent studies suggest that C5L2 acts as a functional receptor especially in the setting of sepsis where release of high mobility group box 1 protein requires the presence of C5L2 receptor on macrophages. Blockade of C5L2 along with C5aR greatly improves survival in sepsis when compared to blockade of either receptor alone (Rittirsch et al. 2008a). Under such conditions, there is a broad suppression in levels of cytokines and chemokines in plasma.",

            "text": "Given the multitude of effects that complement can exert, there are mechanisms in place to limit complement activation where and when it occurs. For example, the phlogistic potential of both C3a and C5a is quickly reduced by plasma carboxypeptidases that cleave the C-terminal Arginine, resulting in C3a des-Arg and C5a des-Arg, each of which has less than 10% of their original biological activity. C3a des-Arg, which is also known as acylation-stimulating protein (ASP), is thought to induce triglyceride synthesis in adipocytes (Kalant et al. 2005). C3b and C4b are also quickly inactivated by proteolytic cleavage into fragments iC3b, C3dg, C3c, C4c, C4d by the serine protease Factor I in the presence of cofactors: membrane cofactor protein (MCP) and complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) that are membrane bound and Factor H which is bound to host surfaces. CR1 promotes phagocytosis, helping to clear immune complexes by binding to C3b in immune complexes. Failure to clear these complexes leads to deposition of complexes in tissues and activation via Fc receptors, resulting in tissue injury. CR2 (CD21) binds iC3b, C3dg and C3d (Holers and Kulik 2007). Furthermore, C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) inactivates C1r, C1s and MASP2 (Davis et al. 2008). Complement activation is also regulated either by preventing the assembly of the C3 convertase or, once it is formed, by inhibiting its activity due to actions of decay acceleration factor (DAF, CD55), C4 binding protein (C4BP), Factor H and a membrane-bound protein found only in rodents, Crry. In addition, the MAC complex formation on cell surfaces or lysis is negatively regulated by S protein (a plasma glycoprotein synthesized by endothelial cells), vimentin (a cytoskeletal protein), and CD59 by interfering with the assembly of the MAC (Huang et al. 2006).",

Subsequently, it was recognized that the complement receptors CR1 and CR2 mediate complement-associated B cell functions. These receptors are expressed on B cells and follicular dendritic cells as well as on a subset of T cells. Furthermore, the CR2-CD19-CD81 complex modulates B-cell receptor signaling, thus affecting the amplitude of B cell responses when presented with antigens. CR1 and CR2 also appear to play a role in B cell differentiation, selection, maintenance and elimination of self-reactive B cells (Carroll 2004).",

SLE is associated with the presence of anti-nuclear antibodies and extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) and absence of anti-DNA antibodies. It is thought that absence of key complement proteins results in: (1) in defective immune complex clearance and consequent deposition of the complexes in various organs, especially in the kidney and in arterial walls (causing vasculitis); (2) defective recognition of self by B cells leading to autoimmunity; and (3) defective disposal of dying cells including B and T cells, again leading to autoimmunity. C2 and C4 deficiency is also associated with development of SLE, although the correlation is not as strong as with C1q deficiency. C3 deficiency is very rare in humans and does not usually lead to SLE.

Age-related macular degeneration is thought to occur due to excessive complement activation (Zipfel et al. 2007) and appears to be related to defective Factor H attachment to the Bruch\u2019s membrane in the retina, leading to protein deposits on the membrane known as Drusen. Excessive complement activation has also been associated with disease severity in patients infected with malaria (reviewed in Silver et al. 2010).

It is now well established from both experimental models of sepsis and clinical studies in humans that the complement system plays a key role in the pathophysiology of asthma and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (reviewed in Wills-Karp 2007; Sarma et al. 2006). Asthma is a chronic inflammatory upper airway disease with increasing prevalence throughout the world and especially in young children in the developed world. In asthma, hyper-secretion of mucus occurs in the airways along with smooth muscle proliferation in upper airway (bronchial/bronchiolar) walls together with increased numbers of mast cells, CD4+ T cells and eosinophils. This leads to obstructed airways and accentuated upper airway contractile responses leading to shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing. In ARDS, there is a severe impairment of gas exchange due to damage to the alveolar and vascular epithelium resulting in increased permeability of plasma contents and influx of neutrophils into the interstitial and alveolar spaces.",

Elevated levels of C3a and C5a may also be found in the serum of ARDS patients. Similarly, in septic patients, elevated levels of the MAC complex precede the development of ARDS (Langlois and Gawryl 1988). There is substantial evidence suggesting that varied environmental factors trigger complement activation at the airway interface, leading to recruitment of cells that release inflammatory mediators resulting in further exacerbation of the inflammatory process in asthma and ARDS (Wills-Karp 2007). For example, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1 generated from inflammatory cells induce up-regulation of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and E-selectin) on vascular endothelial cells and in pulmonary epithelial cells, which results in tethering of neutrophils to these surfaces. Neutrophils can exert further tissue damage by releasing myeloperoxidase, elastase, etc. Examples of environmental triggers that activate complement are seen in elevated BAL C3 levels in humans exposed to ozone, and elevated serum C3 levels in children with chronic exposure to cigarette smoke. It has been suggested that proteases released from infiltrating cells into the airways can directly cleave C3 and C5, thereby generating C3a and C5a. Alternatively, antibody-containing immune complexes as well as carbohydrate moieties and macromolecular structures present on pathogens and allergens can activate all three complement pathways. It is likely that complement gets activated by a number of different pathways in asthma and ARDS, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.",

Understanding subversion tactics of pathogens can help in designing therapeutic interventions when unwanted or runaway complement activation does more harm than good. It has been a challenge to design effective therapeutic interventions, although a number of soluble and membrane-bound complement proteins are available as potential therapeutic targets. One of the main problems is the lack of understanding of the exact molecular mechanisms involved in complement-mediated disease pathology (reviewed in Ricklin and Lambris 2007). For instance, a good example is the use of compstatin, a synthetic compound that blocks the C3 convertase. An ideal use of compstatin would be for treatment of patients experiencing age-related macular degeneration, using intravitreal injection into the eye, much as is now done with blocking mAb to VEGF. On the other hand, systemic treatment of septic patients with compstatin runs the risk of excessive blocking of the C3 convertase, which would compromise the production of the vital opsonic factors, C3b and iC3b. Accordingly, this presents the dilemma for using complement inhibitors that target the C3 convertase. The lack of sufficient knowledge about details of complement activation (including the complement regulatory proteins) makes it difficult to predict the efficacy of complement inhibitors that would be given systemically.",
