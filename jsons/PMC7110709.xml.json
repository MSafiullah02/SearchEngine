In a recent study, 3.4% of 1055 arriving pilgrims were classified as nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitides and of them 66.7% had serogroup B [9]. The requirement of the meningococcal vaccination for pilgrims came in effect in 1987 after the occurrence of meningococcal outbreaks [2].The vaccine initially was a bivalent A and C meningococcal vaccine and then was expanded to the quadrivalent vaccine (A,C,Y, W135) in May 2001 [10], [11]. This expansion of the vaccine resulted from the occurrence of two meningococcal outbreaks with serogroup W135 in 2000 and 2001 [12], [13], [14]. The mean numbers of Hajj-related invasive meningococcal disease cases decreased from 13 to 2 cases per year in 1995 compared to 2011 [11]. The requirement of the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine includes all pilgrims from any country. Either polysaccharide or conjugated vaccine could be used with differing need for re-dosing according to ministry of health guidance (every 3 yrs for the polysaccharide vaccine while for the conjugated vaccine every 5 yrs). The advantages of the conjugated vaccine include the ability to eradicate carriage and prevent outbreaks among returning colonized pilgrims. Moreover, ciprofloxacin (500 mg tablets) is administered as an oral chemoprophylaxis to pilgrims arriving from the African meningitis belt [2], [6], [8], [15], [16]. In one study, the carriage rate of N. meningitides was 3.6% and 1.4% in a paired cohort of pilgrims from high endemic countries at arrival and departure, respectively [9]. In an earlier study, the carriage rate of N. meningitidis after a single dose of ciprofloxacin was 5.2% before and 4.6% after the Hajj (P = 0.65) [17]. The carriage rate of N. meningitides among returning pilgrims varies from 0% to 0.6% [17], [18], [19], [20] and thus ciprofloxacin was not adopted as a strategy post-Hajj. The compliance rate with the recommended meningococcal vaccination among arriving international pilgrims is 97\u2013100% [9]. In one study 1055 arriving pilgrims at King Abdul Aziz International Airport, 98% of the pilgrims had the quadrivalent polysaccharide vaccine and 2% had the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) [9]. Recently, N. meningitidis serogroup B is becoming an important cause of meningococcal meningitis in Europe, Australia, and north America and may cause outbreaks [21], [22], [23], [24]. Currently, a vaccine is available against N. meningitidis serogroup B [25] and there is no sufficient data to recommend the addition of this vaccine to the required Hajj vaccines [9]. An ideal meningococcal vaccine would contain the 4 currently available serogroups in addition to serogroup B.",

The impact of the pandemic H1N1 influenza was evaluated in five studies [36], [41], [42], [43], [45]. The largest study included 2699 departing pilgrims and 0.1% were positive for H1N1 virus [43] and other studies showed a prevalence of less than 2% [36], [42]. Influenza vaccine decreases development of influenza like-illness among pilgrims [49]. The compliance with influenza vaccination varies from 7.1% to 100% with an overall compliance of 96.3% [49], [50], [51]. The occurrence of the mismatch between vaccine and circulating influenza strains occur frequently and affect the Hajj pilgrims [52]. Currently, it is recommended that all pilgrims and Umrah visitors receive seasonal influenza vaccination [5]. However, influenza vaccine is currently not obligatory for pilgrims. The issue of influenza vaccine availability to match Southern and Northern hemispheres was discussed by the Saudi Ministry of Health in consultation with the World Health Organization and it was recommended to use the available hemisphere strain as long as there is a match in circulating strains.",

The mosquito transmitting zika virus is the vector of the Yellow fever virus, Dengue Virus and chikungunya virus [72]. In a study of 159 cases of Dengue fever, only two patients were pilgrims [73]. Thus, despite the lack of large studies, it is thought that Dengue virus infection remains limited during the Hajj and Umrah. Thus, pilgrimages during the Hajj and Umrah are advised to take measures to avoid insect bite to reduce the risk of infection with Dengue and other mosquito borne diseases.",

These combined efforts are coordinated by 24 different committees [6]. The Saudi Ministry of Health then issues recommendations for the required vaccinations and other preventive measures. The ministry also ensures compliance with these required vaccines. Multiple studies showed excellent compliance rates with the recommended vaccinations for the pilgrimage and was 97\u2013100% in case of meningococcal vaccination among arriving international pilgrims [9]. There is a concern that these verified numbers through vaccination cards might represent a false data. In order to verify the reported compliance rates, a serologic study of 796 pilgrims showed that the majority of pilgrims were vaccinated and protected against meningococcal serogroups ACWY [76]. The 2017 Hajj season ended with no reported outbreaks. The experience from each Hajj is growing each year and the planning for the 2018 Hajj had already began.
