The structural organisation of both classes of protein is similar with either a single or repeated DNA binding domain preceding a short negatively charged C-terminal tail. In the HMGB class of proteins the HMG DNA-binding domain binds non-specifically and introduces a sharp bend into DNA whereas the AT-hook in the HMGA protein binds preferentially to A/T rich regions of DNA and stabilises a B-DNA struaiu-e. The acidic tails are hypothesised to facilitate the interaction of the proteins with nucleosomes by binding to the positively charged histone tails. Both classes of protein also interact with a large number of transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences.",

This bending is usually a consequence of indirect readout, a mechanism by which the selectivity of binding is dependent not on making direct contacts between the aminoacids and bases, i.e., direct readout, but instead on the physicochemical properties of the DNA molecule itself Recognition of DNA by transcription factors often involves both direct and indirect readout. However, the principles of indirect readout are well illustrated by the histone octamer which, although not a transcription factor itself, completely lacks direct contacts between the aminoacid side chains and the bases of the boimd DNA. The octamer binds 147 bp of DNA which are wrapped in a left-handed superhelix with a total curvature of approximate 10 radians. This curvature contrasts with the stiffness of DNA in solution where the average persistence length (P), defined as the length over which the average deflection of the polymer axis caused by thermal agitation is one radian, is 140-150 bp,^ i.e., the same length as that bound by the histone octamer. For DNA molecules that are not anisotropically curved the affinity of the DNA for the octamer is direcdy proportional to the flexibility (the inverse of the stiffiiess). However the dependence of the binding energy on P is some 10-fold lower than the dependence of the bending energy in solution on P. This implies that the histone octamer increases the apparent flexibility substantially to compensate for the average increase in DNA curvature on binding.",

Concomitandy, the reduction in this repulsion on the inside of the bend permits greater freedom in the motions of the basepairs, with a corresponding reduction in the width of the grooves.

When it does the affinity may be relatively higher or lower. For example, the intrinsically curved TATA DNA sequence whose curvature is compatible with the surface of the histone octamer binds with an affinity that would normally be characteristic of a substantially more flexible isotropic binding site. ' In this case binding is favoured by the lower entropic penalty on binding relative to an isotropically flexible molecide.^ However if the intrinsic bend is too great and therefore less compatible with the protein binding surface the affinity is reduced relative to an isotropically flexible molecule.^^ An extension of this principle of asymmetric alteration of the ionic environment of DNA is provided by the transcription factor TBP and the HMG-domain, found in HMGB proteins, a class of abundant chromosomal proteins and certain transcription factors such as SRY and LEF-1.^^ The HMGB proteins consist essentially of a small L-shaped protein domain with a cluster of hydrophobic residues on its inner surface and an extended unstructured basic region. When these proteins bind to DNA they produce a bend of 95-120\u00b0 over about six base-pairs and decrease both the axial and torsional stiffness. ^ On the outer surface of the bend the hydrophobic 'wedge' towards the apex of the L binds in and widens the minor groove, concomitandy untwisting the DNA. This effect is believed to be facilitated by a local reduction in the dielectric constant which increases the repulsion between opposing sugar-phosphate backbones on the approach of the protein to same time the basic region neutralises the phosphates bounding the major groove on the inside of the bend thus decreasing the repulsive forces and permitting the narrowing of the groove. Additionally the protein inserts, or intercalates, hydrophobic aminoacids into either a single base-step or into two base-steps that are themselves separated by a single base-step. The extent to which this intercalation increases or simply stabilises the induced bend is unclear. The bend induced by the intercalation contrasts with the smooth DNA bending induced by the histone octamer since the intercalation effectively introduces a kink in the DNA such that the stacking interactions between adjacent base-pairs are very substantially reduced.",

A major consequence of introducing a tight bend into DNA is to bring DNA sequences which are far apart on a linear representation of a DNA molecide into close spatial proximity. This effect, which is also characteristic of plectonemically supercoiled DNA, is mediated in chromatin by the HMG-domain transcription factors, such as TCF-1, LEF-1 and SRY. In the case of TCF-1 acting at the enhancer of the TCR promoter, the bend induced by the factor brings together a normally unstable complex of the Ets-1 and PEBP2a DNA-binding proteins and ATF/CREB activator proteins to form a stable complex. ^^ This example is probably a particular case of the more general phenomenon in which the DNA between a transcription factor and its target protein partner must be bent for protein-protein contacts to occur. The ease of bending will depend critically on the distance and the helical phase difference between the binding sites of the factor and its target. Normally unless one or both of the partner proteins are flexible contact will be facilitated when the binding sites are in helical phase, primarily because of the constraints on the torsional flexibility of DNA. However, at least in vitro, the constraints imposed by both torsional and axial rigidity can be overridden by the abundant DNA-bending proteins of the HMGB class. In the presence one of these proteins a requirement for an integral number of helical turns between binding sites is no longer crucial.^^ Furthermore the involvement of the HMGB protein in the formation of the complex need only be transient.",

An excellent example of the dependence of biological function on DNA structure is provided by genome of the enteric bacterium E. colt.

When bound to DNA the surface of the core motif contacting the DNA is concave and resembles that of the DNA binding drug netropsin, which has a similar selectivity for A/T-rich sequences. ^ For both netropsin and an AT-hook one consequence of DNA binding is a modest widening of the minor groove with a concomitant stabilisation of B-DNA structure. In some cases this widening results in a change in the direction of bending of DNA, particularly when that bending is dependent on a narrow minor groove width in A/T-rich sequences. ' Thus a small intrinsic bend of -20\u00b0 towards the minor groove in the IFN-P enhancer is reversed on binding HMGAl. This could then facilitate recognition of the opposing major groove by transcription factors binding to specific sequences. Nevertheless although the HMGA proteins induce only small changes in DNA structure they bind tightly to DNA ligands v^ith distorted or unusual features. These include supercoiled DNA, four-way junctions and baseunpaired regions of AT-rich DNA (reviewed in ref. 34) . Strikingly in vitro these proteins can also introduce supercoils into relaxed DNA, possibly by stabilising cross-overs and thereby stabilising DNA loops. This ability has been suggested as an explanation of the observation that in vitro HMGAl represses the chick globin P gene promoter in the absence of the 3' enhancer but strongly activates transcription in its presence, regardless of whether or not the substrate is free DNA or is assembled into nucleosomes.

However there is now substantial evidence that they interact directly with both transcription factors and with the histone octamer. These interactions can affect transcription factor access to chromatin either directly or by promoting chromatin remodelling. In the latter case the proteins may facilitate repression or activation. There are two established cases in which the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes containing sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins is promoted by the DNA-bending properties of HMGBl and 2, i.e., the proteins have a classical architectural role. First, in V(D)J recombination the lymphocyte-specific proteins RAGl and RAG2 (human recombination activating genes 1 and 2) appear to recruit HMGBl and 2 to the appropriate sites in chromatin ' ^ presumably by protein-protein contacts with the RAGl homeodomain. Here they ensure the \"12/23 rule\". This requires that V(D)J recombination occurs only between specific recombination signal sequences (RSS). Each RSS is made up of a conserved hep tamer and nonamer sequence separated by a non-conserved spacer of either 12 or 23 base pairs. HMGB 1 (in concert with RAG 1,2) facilitates recombination probably by bending the DNA between the two conserved sequences spaced by 23 bp and stabilising a nucleoprotein complex. The HMGB protein plays the dual role of bringing critical elements of the 23-RSS hep tamer into the same phase as the 12-RSS to promote RAG binding and of assisting in the catalysis of 23-RSS cleavage. Recent footprinting experiments indicate that the HMGBl (or HMGB2) protein is positioned 5' of the nonamer in 23-RSS complexes, interacting largely with the side of the duplex opposite the one contacting the RAG proteins. A second instance in which an abundant HMGB protein may facilitate nucleoprotein complex assembly is in the formation of an enhanceosome containing the Epstein-Barr virus replication activator protein ZEBRA and HMGB 1,^^ the two proteins bind cooperatively, HMGBl binding to, and presumably bending, a specific DNA sequence between two ZEBRA recognition sites. Bending of DNA by HMGBl and 2 has also been invoked to explain the essential role of these proteins in initiating DNA replication by loop formation at the MVM (minute virus of mice) parvovirus origin of replication.",

            "text": "In vitro HMGB proteins can enhance the binding of various transcription factors (e.g. adenovirus MLTF, Oct-1 and 2, HoxD9, p53, steroid hormone receptors, Rel proteins, p73, Dof2 and the Epstein-Barr activator Rta) to their cognate DNA binding sites (reviewed in ref GG). Similarly rat SSRPl has been shown to facilitate the DNA binding of serum response factor and human SSRPl is associated with the y isoform of p63 in vivo at the endogenous MDM22inAp2nfl'\"^^ promoters.^^ In most of these cases, the interaction of the HMG protein with the transcription factor has been detected in vitro and could, in principle, serve as the mechanism for recruitment of HMGB 1 or 2 to particular DNA sites. In some cases transfection experiments indicate functional interactions in vivo. Direct interactions between Nhp6p and the Gal4p and Tup Ip transcription factors have also been inferred in vivo by a split-ubiquitin screen and confirmed by a pull-down assay.^^ Although the demonstrated interactions in vitro so far involve an HMGB protein and a single transcription factor, it is entirely possible that in vivo, in a natural regulatory context, the bending of DNA by HMGBl and 2 could potentially allow the recruitment of a second transcription factor to the complex, in an analogous manner to the action of sequence-specific HMG-box transcription factors^ such as LEF-1 in the enhanceosome at the T cell receptor alpha (TCRa).^^ HMGBl may play a catalytic, chaperone role, since it does not appear to be stably incorporated into the final complex. Although a role for HMGBl and HMGB2 induced DNA bending in the facilitated binding of transcription factors, while being entirely plausible, has not been directly established, it is strongly suggested by the ability of HU to substitute for the HMGBl-stimulated binding of the Epstein Barr virus transactivator Rta to its cognate binding sites.'^^ A possible role for an HMGBlinduced change in DNA conformation in facilitation of transcription factor binding is also suggested by the observation that HMGBl promotes binding of p53 to linear DNA but not to GG bp DNA circles. However, in this case the data do not distinguish between possible effects of DNA bending or untwisting.",

In mice the loss of HMGBl but not of HMGB2 is lethal although in the former knock-out there are pleiotropic effects on glucose metabolism while in the latter spermatogenesis is impaired. ' This suggests a functional redundancy between members of the HMGBl and 2 family. A similar situation occurs with Nhp6ap and Nhp6bp in yeast.'^^ However, the different phenotypes of the HMGBl and HMGB2 null mice probably reflect specific roles for the two proteins in different tissues.\"^^'\"^ In S. cerevisiae the transcriptional effects o(NHP62irc not general but gene-specific. At the CHAl locus, loss of NHP6results both in an increase in the basal level of transcription and in a substantial decrease in the induced level.^^ This suggests an effect at the level of chromatin. The CHAl regulatory region contains a positioned nucleosome which occludes the TATA box under non-inducing conditions. On induction the TATA region becomes accessible.''^ However in the mutant strain, consistent with the increased basal level transcription, the chromatin structure of the TATA region in the uninduced state is similar to that in the induced wild-type strain. NHP6thus appears to be required for establishment of the organised chromatin structure characteristic of the uninduced state. The RSC remodelling complex is also required for this process''^ suggesting that RSC and Nhp6p may cooperate to remodel chromatin.",

Rpd3p and Gcn5p contribute to the dynamic balance between histone acetylation and deacetylation.^^ Both histone acetylation and the sin (SWI/SNF independence) phenotype are correlated with chromatin unfolding ' and/or enhanced nucleosome accessibility^^ while histone deacetylation would be expected to favour folding.

            "text": "The ability of the HMGB proteins to promote both transcription factor binding to their cognate sites and also chromatin remodelling implies that these activities could be coordinated to alter chromatin structure in the vicinity of a factor binding site. Like the HMGA proteins the abundant HMGB proteins bind to nucleosomes at sites close to the DNA exit and entry points. An insight into how HMGB proteins might alter the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA was provided by the observation that HMGBl could facilitate the binding and subsequent remodelling function of the ACF remodelling complex in vitro.^ Further observations showed that HMG-D, a Drosophila HMGB protein, when bound to nucleosome core particles increased the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to restriction endonucleases at particular sites. These sites were asymmetrically distributed, one site being located at one end of the bound DNA and the other in the vicinity of the nucleosome dyad. This effect required the acidic tail of the HMGB protein: without it the HMG-D reduced accessibility at all sites tested on the nucleosome. This result argues that certain HMGB proteins can alter the structure of nucleosomes and to do so presumably by interacting with an available basic region of the histone octamer. From the distribution of the sites with increased accessibility a prime candidate would be one (but not both) of the N-terminal tails of histone H3 or one of the C-terminal tails of histone H2A. It is important to note that the yeast Nhp6 proteins lack an acidic region and so could not interact with histones direcdy in this way. However they can associate with two other proteins, Pob3p and Sptl6p, to form a complex, SPN, involved in chromatin remodelling. ' Both these proteins contain extensive acidic regions and so, in principle, could substitute for the lack of an acidic region in Nhp6p.",

This is achieved by inserting the sidechains of hydrophobic aminoacid residues (space-filUng representation) between adjacent base-pairs at two locations separated by one base-step. The a-helices of the protein are depicted in red and yellow. The DNA structure shown contains a 'bulge' in which two adjacent bases on one of the strands are unpaired.
