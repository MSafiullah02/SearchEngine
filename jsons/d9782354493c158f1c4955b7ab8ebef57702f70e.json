On this basis, viroids have an obvious academic interest, but additionally most of them incite specific diseases in economically important plants such as potato, tomato, cucumber, hop, citrus, grapevine, coconut palm, fruit trees (apple, pear, plum, peach, avocado) , and ornamentals (chrysanthemum and Coleus).

Those results, supported by others obtained subsequently with citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd), the second member of the group Weathers, 1972a, 1972b) , allowed establishment of the viroid concept on firm experimental grounds. Viroids differ from viruses not only in their genome size, but in other fundamental aspects, prominent among which is the lack of messenger activity of both viroid RNAs and their complementary strands. Clearly these observations, like any negative results, should be regarded with care, but the available evidence strongly supports this view: (1) Viroid RNAs are not translated in different in vitro Hall et al., 1974) and in vivo systems; (2) viroid-infected plants have increased accumulation levels of some proteins, but they are pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins coded by the host and not by the viroid genome Conejero et al., 1979) ; and (3) detailed analysis of viroid sequences have failed to reveal either standard AUG initiation codons (Gross et al., 1978) , or conserved open reading frames of a certain length between closely related members of the group (Haseloff and Symons, 1981) . Viroids and viruses also have distinct evolutionary origins with a proposal tracing the origin of the former back to the precellular RNA world (Section VIII.B).",

Most of them share a model of five structural-functional domains within the proposed rod-like or quasirod-like secondary structure of minimal free energy: C (central), P (pathogenic), V (variable), and TR and TL (terminal right and left, respectively) . The C domain contains a central conserved region (CCR) formed by two sets of conserved nucleotides located in the upper and lower strands, with those of the upper strand flanked by an inverted repeat. On the basis of the presence of a CCR and the absence of hammerhead self-cleaving domains (see later), 24 viroids are classified within the first family, Pospiviroidae, a name derived from that of the type member, PSTVd (Elena et al., 1991; Flores et al., 2000) . The remaining three viroids, avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd) (Symons, 1981; Hutchins et al., 1986) , peach latent mosaic viroid , and chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid (Navarro and Flores, 1997) , do not have a CCR but both polarity strands are endowed with the ability to selfcleave through hammerhead ribozymes. They form the second family, Avsunviroidae, whose name also derives from the type member, ASBVd . This classification is also supported by using phylogenetic reconstructions derived from the whole viroid sequences (Elena et al., 1991; Flores et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "A disease of the avocados (Persea americana Mill.) called sunblotch was first reported in California, although considered to be a physiological stress caused by sunburn (Coit, 1928) or a genetic disorder (Horne, 1929) . Sometime later, the infectious nature of the avocado sunblotch (ASB) disease was realized when it was shown that it could be transmitted from affected scions to healthy rootstocks (Horne and Parker, 1931) . Ten years later graft transmissibility of the disease was well established and the causal agent considered to be a virus (Horne et al., 1941) . Seed transmission was also demonstrated (Wallace and Drake, 1962) . Nevertheless, efforts to isolate and characterize the postulated virus were unproductive. For example, virions were never found in electron microscope studies of tissue extracts or thin sections of diseased tissue . A series of experimental results published in [1979] [1980] , pointed out the possibility that the causal agent of the ASB disease could be a viroid rather than a virus. Analysis of partially purified nucleic acid extracts of ASB-affected avocados by gel electrophoresis showed the existence of a low molecular weight (8S) RNA, which was not present in similar extracts of healthy plants (Dale and Allen, 1979; Thomas and Mohamed, 1979) . Although it was suggested that the 8S RNA species might be a viroid and the causative agent of the disease, infectivity data using this RNA as inoculum were not provided. Examination of purified preparations of the ASB-associated RNA by electron microscopy under partly denaturing conditions showed a mixture of circles and rod-like structures, whereas under completely denaturing conditions, mostly circular molecules were seen (Palukaitis et al., 1979) . Therefore, this RNA appeared to be a single-stranded covalently closed circular molecule with a high secondary structure content, in line with its presumed viroid nature. Mechanical transmission of the ASB-associated RNA was accomplished later on using fractionated extracts from fruits with typical ASB symptoms . They showed that the infectious agent was a low molecular weight nucleic acid more concentrated in the high-speed supernatant than in the pellet of an extract prepared with a method noninvolving phenol. Moreover, the agent showed some sensitivity to RNase and a pronounced thermal stability. At the same time, other results showed that the ASB-associated low molecular weight RNA species was soluble in 2M LiC1, resistant to RNase digestion in high salt buffers and more sensitive at low salt concentrations (Mohamed and Thomas, 1980) . All these properties provided additional support to the viroid hypothesis, which gained an almost definitive momentum when healthy avocado seedlings mechanically inoculated with the purified ASB-associated RNA developed the characteristic disease symptoms Utermohlen et al., 1981) . The size of the avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd) was estimated in 70-72 kDa on the basis of its electrophoretic mobility in denaturing and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. However, the lack of sequence similarity between ASBVd and other known viroids, and the ability of ASBVd dimeric transcripts of both polarities to self-cleave in vitro to unit-length strands through hammerhead structures---a property shared by some viroid-like satellite RNAs but not by typical viroids--left open for some time the possibility that ASBVd might be a viroid-like satellite RNA. This is especially the case because avocado trees are often infected by what appeared to be one or more seed-transmissible viruses that could potentially act as helper viruses (S~inger, 1988) . This possibility was dismissed when a second viroid, whose polarity strands were also able to self-cleave through hammerhead structures, was discovered .",

            "text": "Sunblotch is an economically important disease occurring in many of the avocado-producing countries of the world. It reduces the crop yield and lowers the fruit quality. First detected in the United States (Whitsell, 1952) , the disease was also reported in other important avocado growing areas such as South America, Australia, South Africa, and the Mediterranean basin including Israel and Spain (Zentmeyer, 1959; Dale et al., 1982; Desjardins, 1987; LSpez-Herrera et al., 1987) . The disease agent is transmitted by grafting, including root grafting that can occur naturally (Whitsell, 1952; Wallace, 1958) and, as indicated previously, mechanically, emphasizing the need to disinfect pruning tools . The rate of seed transmission is important, especially in symptomless carrier trees (Wallace and Drake, 1962) , which are of special concern for disease control (Section IV.B). The viroid is also pollen-transmitted in field trees at a rate of 1-4%, and both symptomatic and symptomless carrier trees can serve as pollen donors (Desjardins et al., 1984) . The sanitary status with respect to ASBVd was originally evaluated by graft transmission to suitable indicator avocado seedlings, but this indexing system is slow because the characteristic symptoms of ASB disease can take up to 2 years to develop in grafted seedlings (Wallace and Drake, 1962) . Faster results can be obtained using molecular approaches that include, in order of increasing sensitivity, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Da Gra~a and Moon, 1983) , liquid or dot-blot hybridization with labeled cDNA or cRNA probes Allen and Dale, 1981; Rosner et al., 1983; Bar-Joseph, et al., 1985) , and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) using ASBVdspecific primers (Schnell et al., 1997) . A particular problem to circumvent is that large variations, up to 10,000-fold, in the ASBVd accumulation levels between different infected trees and even between branches of the same tree, have been found .",

It was estimated that about 30% of the peach cultivars newly imported from the United States, China, and Japan were affected by the PLM disease that was graft-transmissible. Its high incidence converts this malady into one of the most important affecting peach nowadays. PLM is an epidemic disease that under natural conditions annually spreads in the orchards by up to 5% to any trees surrounding an infected one. The agent of PLM disease does not seem to be transmitted by mites or pollen, but it can be transmitted by the aphid Myzus persicae, which appears as a possible vector in the field .",

However, a synergism with other biotic and abiotic stresses was observed; the PLM-affected trees showed a decrease in resistance to bacteriosis and virosis, as well as to low and high temperatures. Because symptoms of PLM disease may be confused with those caused by other pathogens, a specific biological test was developed in France to detect the inciting agent of the disease (Section VI.A). Some of the characteristics of this agent, although initially suspected to be a virus, suggested the possibility of a viroid etiology. Among those characteristics were, particularly, the heat resistance of the agent and the lack of success in purifying and identifying the presumed viral particles. Another interesting observation was that the minimum contact time required by the inciting agent of the PLM disease to move from the infected piece of tissue serving as inoculum into the receptor plant, a parameter that appears to increase with the size and complexity of the pathogen, was significantly shorter (1-2 days) than that required for different viruses affecting peach (3-4 days) (Boy~ and Desvignes, 1986) . Initial attempts to determine the nature of the PLM agent were unsuccessful (Monsion et al., 1988) , but they established that the infectivity was associated with a low molecular weight nucleic acid fraction, an observation consistent with the involvement of a viroid. Further studies led to the detection of a viroidlike RNA in nucleic acid extracts from peach samples infected with severe and latent isolates of the PLM agent (Flores and Ll~cer, 1988) . Such an RNA was absent in extracts from healthy controls, supporting the association of the PLM disease with the viroid-like molecule. The association was reinforced when the same viroid-like RNA was isolated from trees of 20 peach varieties naturally infected by the PLM agent, but not from the same varieties PLM-free after a thermotherapy treatment.",

Moreover, an RNA with identical properties to that used in the inoculum was recovered from these symptom-showing plants (Flores et al., 1990) . In consequence, such RNA was named peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd). A low accumulation of PLMVd in the infected tissue was observed and, indeed, the amount of viroid RNA purified after two steps of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) did not exceed 1-2 ~g per kg of fresh peach leaves (Flores et al., 1990) . The viroid is well distributed in different organs of the infected trees: young shoots, old branches, bark, leaves, roots, fruits, main veins, and stem wood . However, in agreement with the lack of seed transmission of this pathogen reported previously (Desvignes, 1986 ), PLMVd has not been detected in seeds.",

This technique enabled the exploration of the relationships between PLM disease and other maladies affecting peach whose etiological agent was unknown. The PLM disease had been related to peach mosaic (PM), peach calico (PC), and peach blotch (PB) diseases known in the United States for more than 50 years (Hutchins, 1932; Pine, 1976) , and to peach yellow mosaic (PYM) disease reported in Japan (Kishi et al., 1973) . These disorders share some common characteristics: (1) similar symptoms, (2) the fact that peach is the principal natural host and transmission attempts to herbaceous plants have generally failed, (3) cross-protection between strains of different severity, and, (4) heat resistance. On this basis, it was presumed that they were caused by the same pathogen (Desvignes, 1986) . Indeed, once PLMVd clones were available, hybridization experiments showed that PLMVd cRNA probes recognized different PLMVd isolates, as well as isolates from Japanese peach cultivars displaying the characteristic symptoms of PYM disease (Ambr5s et al., 1995) . These results demonstrated that both PLM and PYM maladies are caused by the same pathogen, PLMVd, confirming previous conclusions based on cross-protection bioassays (Desvignes, 1976 (Desvignes, , 1986 . However, RT-PCR experiments with primers derived from the PLMVd reference sequence showed that PLMVd does not share any similarity with the PM disease agent (Shamloul et al., 1995) , which presumably is caused by a virus related to cherry mottle virus (James and Howell, 1998; Gispert et al., 1998) . Testing a direct involvement of PLMVd in PC and PB diseases has not been possible because the typical isolates initially described are not available any longer.",

Moreover, a frequent occurrence of PLMVd has been observed in some studies based on an extensive sampling of a given area. For instance, of 50 peach trees of different American varieties grown in Valencia (Spain), 88% were PLMVd-infected . A more recent study in this same area revealed that 82% of 134 peach and nectarine cultivars, most of them of American origin, were PLMVd-infected, although these high figures may also in part reflect bad nursery practices (Badenes and Ll~cer, 1998) . Similarly, a comprehensive survey of commercial peach and nectarine cultivars collected from Virginia, Colorado, Oregon, California, and Washington showed that from a total of 1000 trees from the field and 291 trees from greenhouses, 50% were infected with PLMVd (Skrzeczkowski et al., 1996) .",

Soon afterward it was described as induced by a graft-transmissible agent (Dimock et al., 1971) . The specific CChM symptoms did not resemble those of other chrysanthemum diseases known to be incited by a fungus, bacterium, or nematode. Attempts to isolate fungi and bacteria from diseased plants were negative, suggesting the involve-ment of a virus-like pathogen. Mechanical inoculations of healthy chrysanthemum plants of the Yellow Delaware and Deep Ridge cultivars with sap from leaves expressing the typical symptoms of the CChM disease resulted in infection and conspicuous symptoms development, thus discarding ideas of a nutritional imbalance and reinforcing the presumable virus etiology. However, parallel sap inoculations to several herbaceous plants used as diagnostic hosts for three known chrysanthemum viruses were negative, indicating that they were not involved in the CChM disease.",

            "text": "Soon after the description of the CChM disease, biological evidence was presented that supported the involvement of a small-sized RNA consistent with that expected for a viroid. The causual agent was (1) extremely unstable in slightly acidic buffers but considerably more stable in alkaline buffers, (2) sensitive to RNase but not to DNase, and (3) not sedimentable in centrifugal fields up to 120.000 g. Rate-zonal centrifugations in sucrose density gradients showed a predominant species sedimenting between 6 and 14S (Romaine and Horst, 1975) . In accordance with this proposed viroid etiology, electron microscope studies of thinly sectioned tissues and sap preparations failed to reveal virus-like particles (Dimock et al., 1971) . However, repeated attempts to identify a differential RNA associated with the agent of the CChM disease by PAGE were unsuccessful. This could be explained in the case of 5% nondenaturing gels because the infectivity comigrated with the cellular 7S RNA, but gels of lower porosity also failed to reveal a distinct RNA species, and assays to recover infectivity from denaturing gels were also negative (Kawamoto et al., 1985) . In cases where such an RNA was reported, it was most probably a contamination of chrysanthemum stunt viroid (CSVd), another viroid already identified in the same host plant. Furthermore, the causal agent of the CChM disease displayed some unusual properties compared with typical viroids, prominent among which was its insolubility in 2 M LiC1 (Kawamoto et al., 1985) , raising some intriguing questions about its structure. Reinforcing the unique nature of this RNA were the results of coinoculation experiments showing that CSVd, CEVd, and a mild and a severe strain of PSTVd, but not the agent of CChM disease, exhibited cross-protection in a variety of combinations (Niblett et al., 1978) . Because cross-protection in viruses only occurs between strains of the same or closely related viruses, these results suggested that the agent of CChM disease might be different from the other three known viroids. In any case, although CChM was one of the first diseases presumed to be induced by a viroid, the molecular structure of its causal agent remained an enigma for more than 20 years.",

Examples of biophysical techniques are electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, dye binding, hydrodynamic studies, temperature-jump kinetics, and electron microscopy.

The branched secondary structure proposed for PLMVd has 70.6% of the residues paired, including 38.6% A-U, 49.6% G-C, and 11.8% G-U pairs ( (Navarro and Flores, 1997) . Because the solubility of similar sized RNAs in high salt concentrations is presumably governed by conformation rather than by sequence, these results show that the in vitro foldings of CCh-MVd and PLMVd are different from those of other viroids. The most stable secondary structures provide a likely interpretation for this different behavior. Viroids having a compact rod-like or quasi-rod-like structure, including ASBVd, are soluble in 2 M LiC1, whereas viroids with a branched conformation are insoluble under the same conditions (Navarro and Flores, 1997) . Analysis of sequence variability gives strong support for the in vivo existence of such branched conformations in PLMVd (AmbrSs et al., , 1999 and, particularly, in CCh-MVd (De la Pefia et al., 1999) (Section VII.A).",

Hammerhead structures can be formed by the plus strands of three satellite RNAs of nepoviruses: those of tobacco ringspot virus (sTRSV), Arabis mosaic virus (sArMV), and chicory yellow mottle virus (sCYMoV). These three satellite RNAs contain hairpin ribozymes in their minus polarity strands (Bruening et al., 1991) . Five satellite RNAs of sobemoviruses can also adopt hammerhead structures: the satellite RNA of lucerne transient streak virus (sLTSV) in both polarity strands and those of Solanum nodiflorum mottle virus (sSNMoV), velvet tobacco mottle virus (sVTMoV), subterranean clover mottle virus (sSCMoV), and rice yellow mottle virus (sRYMV) in the plus strand. Finally, the satellite RNA of barley yellow dwarf virus (sBYDV), a luteovirus, can also adopt hammerhead structures in both plus and minus strands (Miller et al., 1991) . Hammerhead structures have been also reported in the strands of both polarities of two other small circular RNAs: one from cherry whose biological nature remains to be determined , and another from carnation with the remarkable property of having a homologous DNA counterpart Darbs and Flores, 1995) (Section VIII.A). Besides the aforementioned plant RNAs, sequences able to form hammerhead structures have been found in the transcripts of the DNA satellite 2 of six species in four different families of caudate amphibians (Epstein and Gall, 1987; Zhang and Epstein, 1996) , and in a satellite DNA of three Schistosorne species (Ferbeyre et al., 1998) .",

They have been represented ( Fig. 6 .2) according to the three-dimensional structure determined by X-ray crystallography (Pley et al., 1994a) , and their helices are named following an established convention (Hertel et al., 1992) . ASBVd hammerhead structures have short helices III of two base-pairs with a loop of three bases in the plus polarity, and of three base-pairs with a loop of three bases in the minus polarity ( Fig. 6 .2). The existence of weak helices III with short closing loops implies that they are thermodynamically unstable, especially that of plus polarity. Alternative and more stable hammerhead structures were proposed for ASBVd, which involve the interaction of the sequences corresponding to two single hammerhead domains to form double-hammerhead structures with extended helices III ( Fig. 6 .2) (Forster et al., 1988) . Experimental data support the idea that a double-hammerhead structure is involved in the self-cleavage of the dimeric plus ASBVd RNA during in vitro transcription, as well as after purification of the primary transcript and incubation under standard conditions, whereas the dimeric minus ASBVd RNA self-cleaves by a double-hammerhead structure during transcription but by a single-hammerhead structure after purification (Davies et al., 1991) . As in most other natural hammerhead structures, a C residue precedes the self-cleavage sites of plus and minus ASBVd hammerhead structures. Between the conserved CUGA and GA sequences, they have U and A residues in the plus and minus polarity, respectively, conforming also to other natural hammerhead structures where the residue in this position is U or C, and exceptionally A, but never G (Bruening, 1989; Keese and Symons, 1987) .",

In other cases, symptoms are expressed as a variegated pattern affecting part or the complete leaf surface, which usually is accompanied by distortions. Stem symptoms, which are frequently the first to appear, include streaks ranging in color from white to yellow and orange, which sometimes are depressed. Bark cracking is also commonly observed in ASBVd-infected trees (Whitsell, 1952) , which usually present a stunted appearance. Symptomatic fruits display crater-shaped yellow or pink areas that can cover most of the fruit surface, rendering them unmarketable. The period between inoculation and the onset of symptom development can be shortened by growing the plants at high temperature (Da Gra~a and Van Vuuren, 1981) , but other reports point out additionally that there is the need for continuous light (Desjardins, 1987) . Occasionally, some ASBVd-infected trees appear to recover (symptomless carriers) and although they appear visually healthy, they usually have a reduced fruit yield. Interestingly, there is an increase in the rate of seed transmission of the viroid in these symptomless carriers, and progeny seedlings are symptomless carriers themselves and cannot be induced to develop symptoms (Desjardins, 1987) .",

The most conspicuous PLMVd symptoms become visible under field conditions 2 years after planting with infected material. These symptoms are delays in foliation, flowering, and ripening; deformations of fruits that usually present cracked sutures and enlarged stones; bud necrosis; and rapid aging of the trees. A yellow mosaic or blotch is very rarely observed on the infected leaves, which in some cases completely covers the leaf area (calico symptoms) (Desvignes, 1986) . In the greenhouse, PLMVd natural isolates are divided into severe or latent strains, depending on whether or not, they induce leaf symptoms on seedlings of the peach indicator GF-305 (Desvignes, 1976 (Desvignes, , 1980 . Symptoms of the CChM disease initially described in natural infections included mild mottling of young leaves, general chlorosis of new leaves often following mottling of early-formed leaves, dwarfing of leaves, flowers and the entire plant, and delay in blossom development (Dimock et al., 1971) . However, because expression of symptoms was erratic, a detailed study with plants experimentally inoculated by implantation of infected tissue was carried out. This study revealed that temperature had a pronounced effect on symptom expression. Under optimal temperature (24 \u00b0 to 27\u00b0C) and relatively high light intensities, cuttings of the chrysanthemum cultivars Bonnie Jean and Deep Ridge reacted uniformly to the time (12-15 days) and intensity of symptoms that followed a defined sequence: mild mottling, marked mottling with sharply defined yellow and dark-green areas in the next leaves, and complete chlorosis in the subsequently developing leaves (Dimock et al., 1971; Horst, 1987) .",

This may be related to the chloroplastic localization of ASBVd and PLMVd (Section IV.C), and presumably of CChMVd. Another intriguing common feature of the symptom expression patterns caused by the three members of the Avsunviroidae family is the frequent reversion of symptomatic plants to a nonsymptomatic condition, at least as leaves are concerned. This reversion, already mentioned in relation to ASBVd and PLMVd, has also been observed in CChMVd-infected plants that may at one time be chlorotic, and then 1 or 2 weeks later appear momentarily recovered, and finally exhibit severe symptoms (Dimock et al., 1971) . These fluctuating patterns may be the consequence of changes in the composition of the corresponding quasispecies distributions of viroid sequences (Section VII.A).",

This is in sharp contrast to PSTVd, the type species of the Pospiviroidae family, which accumulates in the nucleus (Diener, 1971a; Harders et al., 1989; Woo et al., 1999) , as do other members of this family (Bonfiglioli et al., 1996) . Circumstantial evidence supporting a chloroplastic localization for PLMVd has been obtained because this viroid, unlike PSTVd, is not imported into the nucleus of permeabilized tobacco protoplasts (Woo et al., 1999) . More recent results show that PLMVd accumulates predominantly in the chloroplast (Bussi~re et al., 1999) . Finding a viroid in a subcellular compartment does not necessarily imply that replication takes place there, but data on the localization of viroid complementary strands support that PSTVd replicates in the nucleus (Spiesmacher et al., 1983) , and ASBVd (Bonfiglioli et al., 1994; Navarro et al., 1999) and PLMVd (Bussi~re et al., 1999) in the chloroplast. Therefore, although still incomplete, the emerging evidence strongly suggests that the replication and accumulation site is another demarcation criterion for members of both viroid families.",

In addition to these alterations, bodies composed of large whorls of membrane have been also found in the discolored areas of young leaves (Desjardins, 1987) that resemble those detected previously in PSTVd-infected tomato leaves (Hari, 1980) . In other studies carried out with avocado leaves completely chlorotic since emergence, some chloroplasts exhibited gross malformations while others looked similar to proplastids (Desjardins, 1987) .

            "text": "Viroids and viroid-like satellite RNAs, including the human hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA, are assumed to replicate through a rolling circle mechanism with exclusively RNA intermediates. All these small pathogenic RNAs have a circular structure, or they go through a circular intermediate during replication. A homologous DNA has never been detected in infected tissues (Zaitlin et al., 1980; Branch and Dickson, 1980) , despite some initial reports indicating the contrary. The only exception is the carnation small viroid-like RNA, which has a homologous DNA counterpart (DarSs and . Initial studies by Northern blot hybridization showed that in infected tissues, in addition to the most abundant infectious RNA to which by convention is assigned the (+) polarity, other viroid-specific RNAs were also present. These were presumed to play a replicative intermediate role and included CEVd RNAs of the complementary (-) polarity (Grill and Semancik, 1978) , and (-) PSTVd RNAs of longer-than-unit length forming part of double-stranded complexes (Branch and Robertson, 1981; Rohde and S~inger, 1981; Owens and Diener, 1982) . Oligomeric (+) RNAs were also detected in ASBVd-infected tissue (Bruening et al., 1982) . The longer-than-unit nature of the postulated replicative intermediates suggested they resulted from a rolling circle mechanism operating on the initial circular template, and a model of this class was first presented for PSTVd (Branch and Robertson, 1981) . The model, similar to that proposed for the replication of the single-stranded circular DNA of the bacteriophage ~X174 (Gilbert and Dressier, 1968) , was originally conceived to explain the replication of some RNA viruses (Brown and Martin, 1965) . It was soon expanded to include all viroid-like RNAs and two alternative pathways, asymmetric and symmetric, were considered depending on whether one or two rolling circles operated, respectively (Branch and Robertson, 1984) .",

In this symmetric variant of the rolling circle model (Fig. 6. 3), the monomeric (+) circular RNA serves as the template for an RNA polymerase that, after several RNA-RNA transcription rounds, leads to a linear (-) oligomer. This RNA, remarkably, self-cleaves through a hammerhead ribozyme contained in the RNA itself (Sections III.C and V.C). The monomeric (-) linear RNA is then ligated to the circular form that in the second half of the cycle, symmetric to the first half, serves as the template for synthesis of the linear (+) oligomer, which after self-cleavage and circularization gives the final product:--the monomeric (+) circular RNA. Northern blot analysis of nucleic acids preparations from ASBVdinfected avocado using probes of both polarities showed the existence of a ladder of viroid-specific RNAs of multimeric size, ranging from the monomer to the octamer for the (+) polarity, but only to the monomer and the dimer for the (-) polarity (Hutchins et al., 1985) . In PLMVdinfected peach, monomers and dimers of both polarities have been also detected (Bussi~re et al., 1999) , but in CChMVd-infected chrysanthemum only monomers have been observed (Navarro and Flores, 1997) . The oligomeric RNAs most probably accumulate in vivo owing to their inefficient self-cleavage. In this respect it is worth mentioning that ASBVd hammerhead ribozymes are efficient in vitro only when acting as double-hammerhead structures, particularly that of (+) polarity (Davies et al., 1991) , in contrast to those of PLMVd and CChMVd that are active as single-hammerhead structures Beaudry et al., 1995; Navarro and Flores, 1997) . For ASBVd, monomers and dimers are present in both linear and circular forms (Hutchins et al., 1985; Darbs et al., 1994) , indicating that dimeric linear RNAs can also be ligated to their circular counterparts to possibly serve as templates in the rolling circle replication. In infected tissue, ASBVd (+) strands are more concentrated than (-) strands, and for monomers and dimers the circular forms are more abundant than the linears (Hutchins et al., 1985; Darbs et al., 1994) . However, in PLMVdinfected peach both (+) and (-) strands accumulate in vivo at comparable concentrations, but the linear is more abundant than the circular (Bussi~re et al., 1999) . An intermediate situation is observed in CCh-MVd: (+) strands accumulate in vivo at higher levels than (-) strands, as in ASBVd; but the linear monomers are more abundant than the corresponding circular forms, as in PLMVd (Navarro and Flores, 1997) .",

More conclusive evidence supporting the existence of the monomeric (-) circular RNA was obtained when nucleic acid preparations from ASBVd-infected tissue were sepa-rated under nondenaturing conditions and then subjected to Northern blot hybridization (Darbs et al., 1994) .

The major constituents of both complexes are the monomeric circular and linear ASBVd RNAs of both polarities, but the slower migrating complex also contains multimeric ASBVd RNAs of both polarities . Therefore, they seem to be composed by the monomeric circular (+) and (-) templates bound to the nascent ASBVd RNAs of the complementary polarity. Detection of the PLMVd monomeric (-) circular RNA in infected tissue does not present technical problems because an important imbalance between (+) and (-) strands does not exist (Bussi~re et al., 1999) .

The available genetic and biochemical evidence supports the existence of two DNA-dependent RNA polymerases with different specificity in plastids (see for a review Stern et al., 1997) . One has a multisubunit core similar to that of the eubacterial RNA polymerase and, because the homologs of the genes for the a, ~, and ~' subunits of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase have been identified in the plastid genome (Sugiura, 1992) , it has been termed the plastid-encoded polymerase (PEP). A set of ~-like factors encoded in the nucleus provides PEP with the specificity to recognize promoters similar to those ofEscherichia coli RNA polymerase with -35 and -10 consensus sequences (Tanaka et al., 1996 (Tanaka et al., , 1997 . Additionally, plastids contain a single-subunit nuclear-encoded polymerase (NEP) similar to bacteriophage T3, T7, and SP6 RNA polymerases (Lerbs-Mache, 1993) that initiates transcription from nonconsensus promoters (Allison et al., 1996; Kapoor et al., 1997; Vera and Sugiura, 1995; Vera et al., 1996) . The gene presumably coding for NEP, rpoZ, has been recently identified in Arabidopsis thaliana together with another one, rpoY, both of which have similarities with those encoding the RNA polymerases from bacteriophages such as T3, T7, and SP6, and the RNA polymerase from yeast mitochondria. Moreover, the putative transit peptides coded by rpoZ and rpoY are capable of targeting fusion proteins to chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively (Hedtke et al., 1997) . In line with this view, the structure of a NEP promoter from tobacco recently characterized contains a core sequence motif also present in plant mitochondrial promoters (Liere and Maliga, 1999) .",

            "text": "Therefore, at least two plastid RNA polymerases exist, posing the question about which enzyme catalyzes the polymerization of ASBVd strands. A similar question regarding which of the three nuclear RNA polymerases is involved in the synthesis of PSTVd and other closely related members of the Pospiviroidae family as CEVd and HSVd, which replicate and accumulate in the nucleus, has been tackled by studying the effects of a-amanitin on this process. Experiments with in vivo (Mfihlbach and S~inger, 1979) and in vitro (Flores and Semancik, 1982; Schindler and Mfihlbach, 1992) approaches have revealed that replication of HSVd, CEVd and PSTVd is affected by the low concentrations of (~-amanitin that typically inhibit DNAdependent RNA polymerase II. This strongly suggests that an RNA polymerase II-like enzyme, acting on an RNA template, is involved in the synthesis of these viroids. On the other hand, high concentrations of this inhibitor have no effects on synthesis of ASBVd strands by a cell-free system from ASBVd-infected avocado leaves, indicating the involvement of a different RNA polymerase (Marcos and Flores, 1992) . Recently, by using an improved version of this system derived from purified chloroplasts of ASBVd-infected avocado leaves, which are able to catalyze in vitro the transcription of viroid-specific and chloroplastic RNAs, it has been possible to analyze the effects of tagetitoxin, which inhibits PEP but not NEP (Mathews and Durbin, 1990; Kapoor et al., 1997; Liere and Maliga, 1999) . Concentrations of' tagetitoxin that prevented transcription of series of chloroplastic genes did not affect synthesis of ASBVd strands, thus suggesting that a NEP-like enzyme is the RNA polymerase required in ASBVd replication, although the participation of another tagetitoxin-resistant RNA polymerase from the chloroplast cannot be excluded (Navarro, Vera and Flores, 2000) .",

Attempts to tackle this ques-tion by primer extension approaches have failed to provide a clear answer because the extensions do not end at only one point but at several, which might alternatively correspond to the initiation site, the site where the oligomeric viroid RNAs are cleaved to give rise to the monomeric linear RNAs, or to other sites resulting from the in vivo or in vitro degradation of the circular forms. By using a different experimental approach based on the in vitro capping of linear viroid strands with [(z32-p]GTP and gnanilyltransferase, which exclusively results in labeling those RNAs with a 5'-triphosphate or diphosphate, combined with RNase protection assays, it has been possible to map unambiguously the initiation sites of ASBVd strands . The initiation site of synthesis of the ASBVd (-) strands is located in the A+U-rich right terminal loop ( Fig. 6.1) , and a structurally similar A+U rich terminal loop in the secondary structure proposed for the monomeric (-) circular RNA contains the initiation site of the (+) ASBVd strand. In fact, a short segment of the ASBVd molecule harbors in the (+) and (-) polarities both initiation sites. These sites are flanked by sequences bearing some similarity to those of the two known NEP promoters (Liere and Maliga, 1999) , which are solely composed by a short motif (15 to 19 nt) placed immediately upstream of the transcription start site.",

A line of evidence comes from the characterization of the linear monomeric ASBVd and CChMVd RNAs of one or both polarities isolated from viroid-infected tissues (the \"native\" linear forms); a significant proportion had the same 5' termini as those produced in the corresponding in vitro self-cleavage reactions (Marcos and Flores, 1993; Navarro and Flores, 1997; . Furthermore, two linear (+) and (-) ASBVd RNAs of subgenomic length (137 nt and approximately 148 nt, respectively) and one linear (+) ASBVd RNA of supragenomic length (383-384 nt) have been also detected in ASBVd-infected avocado (Darbs et al., 1994) . The two linear (+) strands have the same 5'-and 3'-terminal sequences, with the supragenomic species being a fusion product of the monomeric and subgenomic (+)ASBVd RNAs. The 3\" termini of the (+) subgenomic and supragenomic ASBVd strands, which at least in the former has an extra nontemplate C residue, could represent a site of premature termination of the (+) strands. The 5' termini of the subgenomic and supragenomic (+)ASBVd strands and the 5' terminus of the subgenomic (-) ASBVd RNA are identical to those produced in the in vitro self-cleavage reactions of (+) and (-) dimeric ASBVd RNAs, respectively.",

In one particular variant of PLMVd in which a mutation in the hammerhead catalytic pocket was observed, the RNA still showed significant in vitro self-cleavage, the corresponding cDNA was infectious, and the mutation was retained in a fraction of the progeny, indicating a sequence flexibility of the hammerhead structure higher than anticipated (AmbrSs and . Therefore, preservation of catalytically active domains in both polarity strands seems to be a structural constraint limiting the genetic divergence of the hammerhead viroids. Indirect evidence on the key role of hammerhead structures in the replication of PLMVd and CChMVd was also obtained from bioassays with individual cDNAs clones, by which a correlation was established between the infectivity of distinct sequence variants and the extent of their self-cleavage during in vitro transcription De la Pefia et al., 1999) .",

Because the ASBVd double-hammerhead structures (Section III.B) can be formed only in longer-than-unit intermediates (Forster et al., 1988) , they may provide a mechanism to prevent self-cleavage of circular monomeric RNAs. In contrast, self-cleavage of PLMVd and CChMVd RNAs most probably occurs through single-hammerhead ribozymes (Hern~indez and Flores, 1992; Beaudry et al., 1995; Navarro and Flores, 1997) . In these two cases, the adoption of very stable conformations that do not contain the hammerhead structures seems to protect the circular monomeric RNAs against self-cleavage (Hernandez and Navarro and Flores, 1997) . Thus, the catalytic structures may form during replication and promote self-cleavage before RNA synthesis has been completed, and the most stable conformations can be adopted. Remarkably, in PLMVd and CChMVd the residues involved in forming plus and minus hammerhead ribozymes and their corresponding self-cleavage sites are opposite each other and contained within a region of the predicted branched secondary structures, which represents approximatley one third of the whole molecule ( Fig.  6.1 ).",

Because in the Avsunviroidae family cleavage of oligomeric viroid RNAs to the monomeric linear forms is autocatalytic and mediated by hammerhead ribozymes, the ligation may also occur autocatalytically in the absence of proteins (self-ligation). Support for this view comes from in vitro experiments in which linear monomeric PLMVd RNA resulting from self-cleavage, self-ligated to a certain extent after incubation (Lafontaine et al., 1995) . However, most of the phosphodiester bonds produced in this reaction are 2',5' (C6te and Perrault, 1997) and not the 3',5' typically found in RNA, making questionable whether this is actually the pathway operating in vivo. On the other hand, in vitro self-ligation has also been observed in the case of PSTVd (Baumstark et al., 1997) , indicating that it is not restricted to hammerhead viroids.",

            "text": "In an alternative view, circularization is assumed to be catalyzed by a host enzyme. Although in vitro experiments have shown that different RNases, including one of fungal origin, are able to catalyze both the cleavage and ligation of longer-than-unit PSTVd transcripts to the infectious monomeric circular form (Tsagris et al., 1987; Tabler et al., 1992) , this mechanism appears unlikely in vivo considering the nonspecific nature of some of the RNases involved and the fact that cleavage is autocatalytic in the Avsunviroidae family. An RNA ligase similar to the well-characterized RNA ligase from wheat germ (Konarska et al., 1981) appears to be a more likely candidate. This enzyme requires in the RNAs to be ligated 5'-OH and 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester termini, the same resulting in hammerhead-mediated RNA self-cleavage, and has a loose specificity regarding the RNAs that accepts as substrates (it can act in either intramolecular or intermolecular ways). In fact, linear PSTVd monomeric RNA isolated from infected tissue can be efficiently converted to circular forms by in vitro incubation with the RNA ligase from wheat germ (Branch et al., 1982) . Moreover, the identification of a 2'-phosphomonoester, 3',5'-phosphodiester bond at a unique site in a viroid-like satellite RNA that exactly coincides with the self-cleavage site determined by the hammerhead structure contained in this RNA (Kiberstis et al., 1985) , is a strong argument in favor of a mechanism like that catalyzed by the wheat RNA ligase, which leaves a 2'-phosphomonoester signature at the ligation site. In line with this view, deletion of the residue located 3' to the self-cleavage site of the plus hammerhead structure in some PLMVd and CCh-MVd variants with a much reduced RNA self-cleavage and infectivity has been assumed to be a cloning artifact introduced by the reverse transcriptase because of the extra 2'-phosphomonoester at the nucleotide preceding the self-cleavage/ligation site (AmbrSs et al., , 1999 De la Pefia et al., 1999) . That a 2'-phosphomonoester represents a severe impediment for the reverse transcriptase comes from experiments in which ASBVd monomeric linear forms resulting from in vitro self-cleavage were ligated in the presence of the wheat germ RNA ligase and then reverse transcribed. An abrupt stop was observed at the self-cleavage/ligation site (Navarro and Flores, unpublished data) . In contrast, such a stop is not detected in reverse transcriptions using the circular ASBVd RNA isolated from infected tissue, suggesting that in avocado a phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of most of the 2'-phosphomonoester groups. A corollary of all this is that, because ASBVd replicates in the chloroplast, an RNA ligase must exist in this organelle. Preliminary evidence that requires further confirmation suggests that this is indeed the case (Navarro, Darbs, and Flores, unpublished data) .",

This situation, together with the long time needed for symptom expression, has so far precluded the description of cross-protection phenomena associated with this viroid, if they exist at all. However, phenomena of this kind were observed in PLMVd and CChMVd, even before they were characterized as viroids, and used for applied purposes. In fact, biological detection of PLMVd in the greenhouse was (and still is) performed in GF-305 peach seedlings by a cross-protection assay (Desvignes, 1976) . In brief, the peach seedlings are first inoculated by chip budding with material from the trees to be analyzed (which even if infected do not usually display foliar alterations, the other symptoms appearing at least 2 years after planting), and approximately 2 months later they are challenge-inoculated with a severe PLMVd strain. Plants already infected with a latent strain of PLMVd do not present the characteristic leaf symptoms induced by the severe strain. Severe strains are relatively stable (some inoculated plants revert to a symptomless condition) and must be maintained in the greenhouse by periodically inoculating new indicator plants with symptomatic tissue. The duration of the bioassay is approximately 3 months, and it has enabled the selection and diffusion in France of PLMVd-free peach cultivars for the last 25 years (Desvignes, 1986) .",

This was assumed to result from a cross-protection effect, and the existence of a transmissible agent that protected against that of the CChM disease was shown by inoculation experiments performed in a cross-protection format (Horst, 1975) . However, direct physical evidence in support of this contention has remained elusive until recently, when Northern blot hybridizations with a probe derived from the CChMVd-S RNA provided the first direct proof for the existence of a CChMVd-NS RNA in the protected chrysanthemum plants (De la Pefia et al., 1999) . The intensity of the hybridization signals generated by CChMVd-S and -NS RNAs was similar, indicating that their associated phenotypes were not the consequence of different accumulation levels in the infected tissue, but rather of subtle variations in the structure of both RNAs.",

This problem occurs because it is difficult to produce successful infections by inoculating mechanically nucleic acid preparations, and also because of the long assay period (1 or more years) usually required for the symptoms to develop. By contrast, successful mechanical inoculation of PLMVd on the peach indicator GF-305 with RNA (Flores et al., 1990) or cDNA preparations (Ambrhs et al., 1998) is possible, and the time elapsed between inoculation and the onset of symptoms is relatively short (8-12 weeks). Moreover, as indicated previously, severe and latent strains of PLMVd that induce symptomatic and symptomless infections, respectively, on GF-305 peach seedling grown in the greenhouse have been reported. Altogether, these properties made the PLMVd-peach system in principle attractive to identify the molecular determinants of pathogenicity in a hammerhead viroid. However, PLMVd isolates have turned out to be extremely complex populations of sequence variants (Ambrhs et al., 1998) , and inoculations with specific cDNA clones of this viroid lead to the rapid accumulation of genomic heterogeneity in their progenies (Ambrds et al., 1999) . This complexity complicates the analysis, and although sequence comparison between the two closest characterized PLMVd variants inciting different host responses has shown that 12 nucleotide changes are sufficient to restore pathogenicity to variants that give rise to symptomless infections, a clear association of the pathogenic effect of some PLMVd variants to a discrete structural motif is not yet possible (AmbrSs et al., 1998) .",

To address this question, a series ofcDNA clones from a CChMVd nonsymptomatic strain (CChMVd-NS) were prepared by RT-PCR using two pairs of adjacent primers derived from the sequence of the symptomatic CChMVd RNA (CChMVd-S). Analysis of the CChMVd-NS clones revealed a size and sequence similar to those of the CChMVd-S strain. Some of the mutations observed in CChMVd-NS molecular variants were previously identified in CChMVd-S RNA, but others were never found in this RNA. Bioassays in chrysanthemum showed that cDNA clones containing the CChMVd-NS specific mutations were infectious, but nonsymptomatic. Moreover, when the contribution of each mutation to the nonsymptomatic phenotype was assessed independently, only the tetranucleotide at positions 82-85 was directly involved (Fig. 6.4) . Indeed, changing by site-directed mutagenesis the GAAA82-85 of a typical CChMVd-S variant into UUUC (the characteristic sequence of CChMVd-NS variants) led to a symptomless infection without detectable alterations of the accumulation level of the viroid progeny (De la Pefia et al., 1999) . Therefore, a change affecting only 1% of the CChMVd sequence involvesa dramatic effect in its biological properties.",

A main factor leading to the detected sequence heterogeneity in viroid isolates is the error-prone nature of the RNA polymerases involved in their replication. For RNA viruses, mutation rates of about 10 .3 to 10 -5 substitutions per nucleotide per round of replication have been estimated (Domingo and Holland, 1994) , and although data of this class are not available for viroids, sireilar or even higher rates can be anticipated considering that the multiplication of these pathogens is mediated by cellular RNA polymerases whose usual templates are double-stranded DNAs (Diener, 1996) . Thus, genomic diversity ofviroid isolates is most probably the result of the frequent generation of mutants and of the selection processes operating on them.",

The determination of the primary structure of 29 different sequence variants revealed some flexibility in the PLMVd size, from 335 to 338 nt, and a large number of polymorphic positions in the viroid molecule. Despite the high heterogeneity detected in PLMVd, the variability pattern found supports the existence of three types of structural constraints limiting the genetic divergence of this viroid: the preservation of the stability of plus and minus hammerhead structures, the adoption of a branched secondary structure of minimal free energy, and the conservation of a potential pseudoknot-like element between two hairpin loops of the proposed secondary structure. Differences were found in the quasi-species that compose the isolates, in accordance with their distinct biological properties. Mechanical inoculation of GF-305 peach seedlings with representative cDNA clones from each PLMVd isolate showed that latent isolates are formed by a mixture of sequence variants, which, when bioassayed individually, induced symptomless infections. In contrast, most but not all of the GF-305 peach seedlings inoculated with cDNA clones from the severe isolate incited the symptomatic infections. In light of these results, different balances reached over time between variants endowed with different pathogenicity could explain the variable phenotype observed in natural infections caused by PLMVd severe isolates, which display a fluctuating symptomatology and frequently revert to an asymptomatic condition. On the other hand, the phenotypical stability of the PLMVd latent isolates is in agreement with the homogeneous biological behavior of the variants that compose this type of isolates (Ambr6s et al., 1998) .",

Moreover, the sequence heterogeneity detected in variants from both CChMVd isolates strongly supports the biological significance of the proposed computer-predicted branched conformation, either because the changes are found in loops or because, when affecting a base-pair, the substitutions are compensatory (Fig.  6.4) . Because covariations or compensatory mutations are considered the most robust approach for testing computer-predicted structures in RNA (Gutell et al., 1994) , these results show that the rod-like or quasirod-like secondary structure is not a universal paradigm for viroids because CChMVd, and most probably PLMVd, presents clearly branched conformations in vivo.",

In other instances new tissue growing from infected trees was symptomless (Semancik and Szychowski, 1994) . The viroid was readily detected in bleached, variegated, and symptomless leaves; but the concentration was highest in the bleached portions and very low in the symptomless adjacent areas of the same leaves (Semancik and Desjardins, 1980) . Discrete variants were identified as predominant in bleached tissue (249-250 nt), as well as in the variegated and symptomless leaves that were indistinguishable in size (247-248 nt). Moreover, most of the changes noted in cDNA clones from bleached tissue were concentrated in the poly(A) right terminal loop leading to its enlargement (Semancik and Szychowski, 1994) . Because regardless of the inoculnm source, inoculations with tissue implants from ASBVd-infected plants always induce bleached leaves as the initial foliar symptom, it has been proposed that the ASBVd variants that predominate in this type of tissue are also present in the variegated and symptomless leaves. Expression of ASB disease may then be viewed as a transition from a severe acute and self-limiting reaction in terms of ASBVd accumulation, to a persistent mild chronic form of infection accompanied by high viroid titers throughout the host (Semancik and Szychowski, 1994) . Unfortunately, the difficult and unpredictable mechanical transmission of ASBVd using nucleic acid preparations has precluded testing this proposal directly by relating specific viroid variants with differential symptoms of the disease.",

Four PLMVd variants, two of which induced symptomatic infections and the other two latent infections on the peach indicator, were selected as parental sequences. The structure of the populations derived from single PLMVd sequences differed according the observed phenotype, but in all cases a rapid accumulation of point mutations was detected. Indeed, determination of the primary structure of 36 progeny variants yielded 33 distinct PLMVd sequences that differed from those reported previously for this viroid (Hernfindez and Ambr6s et al., 1998; Ambr6s and Flores, 1998) . The funding sequence was retained exclusively in one of the four progenies analyzed and only as a minor component, illustrating the rapid evolution that may undergo the PLMVd molecule. These results are in contrast with those obtained from the analysis of progenies derived from natural variants of PSTVd, the type species of the Pospiviroidae family, when inoculated in the experimental host tomato (G6ra-Sochacka et al., 1997) . Quick generation of new quasi-species from single cDNA sequences was also reported for PSTVd, but the rate of accumulation of sequence heterogeneity was notably lower than for PLMVd. It has been speculated that this could reflect involvement of different RNA polymerases with distinct mutation rates in the replication of members of each viroid family (Ambr6s et al., 1999) , a likely possibility considering that replication of PSTVd and ASBVd occur in different cellular organella.",

So far, nine viroid-like satellite RNAs have been identified, three of them associated with members of the nepovirus genus (sTRSV, sArMV, and sCYMV), five associated with members of the sobemovirus genus (sLTSV, sSNMoV, sVTMoV, sSCMoV, and sRYMV), and one associated with a member of the luteovirus genus (sBYDV) (Bruening, 1989; Keese and Symons, 1987; Collins et al., 1998 ) (for abbreviations see Section III.C). Viroid-like satellite RNAs contain ribozymatic domains in one or both polarity strands. The ribozymes of those associated with sobemovirus and nepovirus genera are of the hammerhead type. However, viroid-like satellite RNAs assisted by nepoviruses can form hammerhead ribozymes in their plus polarity strands and hairpin ribozymes in their minus polarity strands. As in hammerhead viroids, the ribozymes of viroid-like satellite RNAs are most likely involved in the replication cycle that also occurs through a rolling-circle model (Bruening et al., 1991) .",

A cherry small circular RNA (csc RNA1) able to form hammerhead structures in both polarity strands has been isolated from cherry trees affected by a specific malady. It shares limited sequence and structural similarity with viroids and particularly with viroid-like satellite RNAs, but whether it belongs to either of these two groups remains to be determined . Another related, although nonpathogenic plant RNA forms part of a retroviroid-like element described in carnation (DarSs and Flores, 1995) . This RNA, called carnation small viroid-like RNA (CarSV RNA) has 275 nt and circular structure and can adopt hammerhead ribozymes in both polarity strands, but its lack of infectivity and, particularly, the existence of a homologous DNA form establish differences between this molecule and members of the Avsunviroidae family. Within the animal kingdom, only the RNA of human hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a defective virus functionally dependent on human hepatitis B virus, is known to undergo self-cleavage, although through structures more complex than those of the hammerhead ribozymes (Rosenstein and Been, 1991; Perrota and Been, 1991) . HDV RNA is a circular molecule able to fold into a rod-like conformation that contains a region termed the viroid-like domain, with significant similarities to viroid and viroid-like satellite RNAs (Branch et al., 1989) . HDV RNA also replicates through a rolling-circle model (Taylor, 1997) .",

In the first consensus phylogenetic tree reported, viroid-like satellite RNAs (including the viroid-like domain of HDV RNA) were clustered on one side and nonhammerhead viroids on the other side, with ASBVd, the only hammerhead viroid known at that time, located between the two clusters (Elena et al., 1991) .

Another hypothesis proposed that viroids may represent \"escaped\" introns taking into account the presence in some of them of a consensus sequence believed to play a key role in the self-splicing of group I introns (Dinter-Gottlieb, 1987) . However, a reexamination of such potential similarities revealed that they could be fortuitous (Diener, 1989) . Moreover, none of the hammerhead viroids contain recognizable cognates of group I intron elements, which together with the different chemistry of self-cleavage in both types of molecules makes a phylogenetic relationship between viroids and introns unlikely (Diener, 1989 (Diener, , 1996 .

Several factors have contributed to the acceptance of this hypothesis, especially the finding of RNAs with catalytic properties and the phenotype-genotype duality of RNA, permitting darwinian evolution to occur at the molecular level in the absence of DNA or proteins (Joyce, 1989) . The postulated RNA world would have been composed of self-replicating RNAs, implying the existence of primitive RNA enzymes. Although most models for self-replicating precellular systems have been based on properties derived from the known self-splicing mechanism of the rRNA gene intron from Tetrahymena thermophila, the ribozyme involved in this process is relatively large and with a complex secondary and tertiary structure essential for the catalytic activity.

In this context it has been proposed that viroid and viroid-like satellite RNAs are molecular fossils of the primitive RNA world (Diener, 1989; Elena et al., 1991) . Many features of these pathogenic RNAs support that they might be relics of precellular evolution (Diener, 1989) . The low fidelity copy of ancient polymerases sets a limit on the length of the molecules that could be faithfully replicated (Eigen, 1971) , and viroid and viroid-like satellite RNAs fulfill the requirement of small size. Moreover, G+C-rich sequences, such as those found in these small RNAs, would be favored because their higher stability would attenuate the effects of the error-prone nature of primitive polymerases (Eigen and Schuster, 1978) . The circularity, another distinctive feature ofviroids and viroidlike satellite RNAs, would ensure the complete copy of the template, excluding the need of genomic tags for specific initiation and termination sites that replication of a linear molecule requires. In addition, systems able to produce multiple copies of their genomes would likely have advantages given the high error rate presumed for prebiotic enzymes (Inoue and Orgel, 1983) , and the rolling-circle transcription of a circular template leads to tandem repeats of genetic information. Last but not least, the finding of catalytic properties in hammerhead viroids and viroid-like satellite RNAs are of particular relevance in that they are remnants of a precellular RNA world (Diener, 1989) .",

This coincidence is unlikely to be casual. Because there is solid evidence supporting the hypothesis that chloroplasts are organelles that evolved from cyanobacteria by symbiosis (Margulis, 1993) , these free-living prokaryotes might have hosted viroids, in particular the ancestors of the Avsunviroidae family, before they became specific to plants (Chela-Flores, 1994; Lima et al., 1994) . This implies that the Avsunviroidae members are the oldest viroids, a view that agrees with their harboring of hammerhead ribozymes and their position in the phylogenetic trees, and that also suggests that viroids might exist in present-day cyanobacteria.",

Considering their limited sequence similarity, it is unlikely that this determinant may be a conserved motif of primary structure and rather points to a secondary structure element that would be specifically recognized by a chloroplastic factor. A parallel question regarding how Pospiviroidae members are imported to the nucleus still remains essentially unanswered, although some progress on the nuclear import of PSTVd in permeabilized protoplasts has been reported recently (Woo et al., 1999) . These latter results illustrate that viroids may be excellent model systems to study the factors governing RNA traffic through different cell compartments.",

When the characterization of human hepatitis delta virus RNA revealed that its circular and rod-like secondary structure resembled that typical of most viroids, the possibility that this RNA could replicate through a rolling-circle mechanism with RNA self-cleavage became immediately apparent. With this enlightening hypothesis in mind, it was just a matter of time before it proved to be correct with the discovery of a new class of ribozymes (Sharmeen et al., 1988; Wu et al., 1989 ). Yet another far-reaching lesson remains to be learned. Ribozymes, one of the most promising tools in biotechnology, are particularly well represented in viroid and viroid-like RNAs in which the two structurally simplest self-cleaving domains, the hammerhead and the hairpin, have been characterized. Therefore, the study of the structure and replication of a group of small and opaque plant RNAs is having unexpected implications and applications far beyond virology and the plant kingdom.",

In members of the Pospiviroidae family, the cleavage reaction leading to monomeric RNA from oligomers is generally assumed to be catalyzed by an unidentified host RNase (Baumstark et al., 1997) . However, recent results have challenged this view by showing that transcripts of the C domain of the CCCVd, a member of the Pospiviroidae family, self-cleave specifically under defined (and unusual) in vitro conditions. The cleavage site is located in the bottom strand of the C domain within a potential hairpin structure preserved in all members of this family, suggesting that they may also self-cleave through one or more novel type of ribozyme (Liu and Symons, 1998) .",
