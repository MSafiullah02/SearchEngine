In the SIS model, each node in the network can be either infected or susceptible (healthy). The infection state of node j for j = 1, . . . ,N at time t is denoted by a Bernoulli random variable X j (t): infected X j (t) = 1 or susceptible (healthy) X j (t) = 0. The SIS model has simple local rules that nodes can be infected by their infected neighbors and be cured by themselves. The infection and curing processes are independent and both Poisson processes with infection rate \u03b2 and curing rate \u03b4, respectively. By tuning the effective infection rate \u03c4 \u03b2/\u03b4, the phase transition of infection persistence emerges at an epidemic threshold determined by the network [2, 3] . If the effective infection rate \u03c4 is below the epidemic threshold, then the virus dies out quickly and every node becomes healthy. Above the threshold, the infection can persist in the network for a very long time [4] .",

            "text": "The autocorrelation contains information about the change of the infection state of each node. A large autocorrelation implies that the change of the infection state is slow, and the infection state is more likely to be identical between time s and t. While a smaller autocorrelation indicates that the infection state between time s and t is more independent. Globally, the fluctuating fraction of infected nodes I (t) 1 N N j =1 X j (t) is also autocorrelated, and the autocorrelation and its spectral analysis of I (t) in real epidemics can be traced back to Anderson et al. [6] . By analyzing the autocorrelation and its spectrum of the incidence data of pertussis, mumps, and measles, Anderson et al. [6] indicate statistically significant seasonal and the longer-term resurgence of those diseases and find that vaccination increases the periods of the longerterm oscillations of the incidence data. However, in the basic networked SIS model, the autocorrelation of the infection state is infeasible to be calculated, because the SIS model is a 2 Nstate Markov process [3, 7] and the computational complexity is exponentially high regarding of the network size N . Previously, Meier et al. [8] , Supplementary Information E analyzed the correlation of the infection state of the SIS model for small time intervals, but the calculation involves higher-order moments. In this paper, we apply the N -intertwined mean-field approximation (NIMFA) [3] to study the autocorrelation of the infection state X j (t) and the fraction of infected nodes I (t) both in the transient and steady states. Particularly in the steady state, we derive the explicit formula of the autocorrelation of the infection state, which is an exponentially decreasing function of time delay. The accuracy of the NIMFA autocorrelation is evaluated by simulating the exact SIS process. The result indicates that NIMFA, as an approximate stochastic process, well captures the autocorrelation properties of the exact SIS process. Moreover, the autocorrelation can also be used to estimate the infection and curing rates of the SIS process.",

A larger \u03b4 leads to a faster transition from infected to healthy, but, simultaneously, the infection probability of each neighbor becomes smaller. Therefore, the state transition of each node is slower from the healthy state to the infected state, and the effect of the curing rate \u03b4 is unclear. Only in special networks can the effect of the curing rate \u03b4 be determined.

The autocorrelation under other mean-field approximations can also be derived with the same procedure. For example, the heterogeneous mean-field approximation (HMF) assumes statistical equivalence among the nodes with the same degree [2] , and the autocorrelation under HMF has the same form as the NIMFA autocorrelation (see Appendix B). In the case of regular graphs, HMF is equivalent [15] to NIMFA and then their approximate autocorrelations are identical.

            "text": "In this section, we compare the NIMFA autocorrelation with the autocorrelation of the exact SIS process from the simulation. The simulation of the exact SIS process is implemented by the Gillespie algorithm (Monte Carlo method) [18] [19] [20] and the theoretical results are obtained by solving the NIMFA Eq. (4) numerically (fourth-order Runge-Kutta method [17, p. 200] ). In the steady state, we run the simulation for 40 000 time units with the curing rate \u03b4 = 1 and sample the infection state of each node every 0.001 time unit. In other words, we obtain the infection state X j (n/1000) for n = 0,1, . . . ,4 \u00d7 10 7 from simulation. We only use the state sequence sampled after t = 10 000 to ensure that the SIS process is in the metastable state. Moreover, the time series of the fraction of infected nodes can be calculated as I (n/1000) = 1 N N j =1 X j (n/1000). In the transient state, 10 4 realizations of the infection states X j (s) and X j (t) are obtained to calculate the autocorrelation between two arbitrary time s and t. Figures 1 to 3 show the NIMFA autocorrelation and the simulated autocorrelation of the infection state of randomly selected nodes in an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) graph, a regular graph with degree 26, and a star graph, respectively. The NIMFA autocorrelation R j \u221e (h) is a very accurate approximation on those graphs. Figure 1 shows that the autocorrelation of the infection state is not sensitive to the value of the curing rate \u03b4, which is reasonable because the deviation of the degree is small and the result is similar to that of the regular graph in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2 , the autocorrelation of the infection state is identical to formula (9) that the autocorrelation is invariant to the curing rate \u03b4 in regular graphs. Figure 3 shows the autocorrelation of the infection state in a star graph. The autocorrelation of the hub node is much smaller than that of the leaf nodes since the infection probability of the hub node is larger. The cross correlation of the infection states between neighbors shown in Fig. 1 to 3 is approximately 0, which leads to the effectiveness of NIMFA since NIMFA omits the cross correlation between neighbors. Initially all nodes are infected to prevent the inaccuracy caused by early die-out [24] . The NIMFA autocorrelation is much smaller than the exact one, and the cross correlations between neighbors and second-hop neighbors are very large. Figure 4 shows the autocorrelation of the infection state of a node in a cycle graph and NIMFA fails to capture the autocorrelation. Actually, NIMFA also fails to approximate the prevalence as shown in Fig. 4 . In the situation of the cycle graph, the cross correlation of the infection states between neighbors is much larger than zero and NIMFA itself is a bad approximation. The accuracy of mean-field methods has been studied in Refs. [21] [22] [23] , which is beyond the scope of this paper.",

For the leaf node and the hub node, the convergent time delay h of the Magnus series of (s,s + h) are h < T \u2248 2.221 and h < T \u2248 0.064 from (17), respectively.

For a large time delay, the inaccuracy is due to either the omission of term O(h 3 ) in (19) or that the NIMFA transition probability matrix P j (s,t) itself is a bad approximation, but we can eliminate the possibility of the latter using Eq.

We obtained the explicit formula of the autocorrelation, i.e., Eq. (8) , under NIMFA in the steady state, and the steady-state autocorrelation follows an exponential decay with the time lag. Interestingly, the steady-state autocorrelation is independent of the curing rate \u03b4 in regular graphs. Moreover, using the Magnus expansion, we are able to calculate the autocorrelation in the transient state of the SIS process. Our analysis of the transient state not only allows the study of the SIS process above or below the epidemic threshold but also opens an avenue for the study of the critical behavior [25] .",

Although NIMFA assumes that there is no correlation between the infection states of neighbors, i.e., E[X i (t)X j (t)] = E[X i (t)]E[X j (t)] for i = j , we show that the NIMFA autocorrelation (i = j ) is generally accurate by simulation, and the accuracy depends on the accuracy of the NIMFA infection probabilities. If NIMFA can capture the first-order moments, i.e., the infection probability of each node and the prevalence, under certain SIS parameters and networks, then NIMFA can also be applied to approximate the autocorrelation properties. Finally, we show that our results can be used to estimate the infection and curing rate of the SIS process. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Q.L. is thankful for the support from China Scholarship Council.",
