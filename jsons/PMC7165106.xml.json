            "text": "The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a public health emergency of international concern (WHO, 2020a, WHO, 2020b). The reported symptoms of COVID-19 patients include cough, fever, difficulty in breathing and diarrhea, and SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been detected in feces of not only symptomatic but also asymptomatic patients (Gao et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020; Jiehao et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020b). These clinical observations imply that municipal wastewater of affected communities might contain the virus. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach to understand the prevalence of viruses in a given wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) catchment population, because wastewater contains viruses excreted from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in a catchment (Sinclair et al., 2008; Xagoraraki and O'Brien, 2020). WBE is especially useful for early warning of disease outbreaks and informing the efficacy of public health interventions, as previously demonstrated for enteric viruses, such as norovirus, hepatitis A virus, and poliovirus (Hellm\u00e9r et al., 2014; Asghar et al., 2014). In Australia, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 25/1/2020, and there have been >6,300 confirmed cases as of April 13, 2020 (Australian Government Department of Health, 2020). In the State of Queensland, there have been 998 cases of COVID-19 recorded on 14/4/2020. The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Brisbane on 21/2/2020 (two passengers from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship) and increased to 541 confirmed cases on the 14th April 2020 in Queensland's Brisbane North and Brisbane South Primary Health Networks (PHNs). To date, there has been no detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Australia, while we note a few recent studies conducted in other parts of the world (i.e., the Netherlands and USA) have reported molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples (Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). Here, we report the first evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Australia. Our preliminary findings demonstrate the applicability of WBE for COVID-19 surveillance as a potential tool for public health monitoring at the community level.",

These methods are referred to as Method A (direct RNA extraction from electronegative membranes) (Ahmed et al., 2015) and Method B (ultrafiltration) (Ikner et al., 2011). Method A began with adjustment of the sample pH to ~3.5 to 4 using 2.0 N HCl. The samples (100\u2013200 mL) were then passed through 0.45-\u03bcm-pore-size, 90-mm-diameter electronegative membranes (HAWP09000; Merck Millipore, Ltd., Sydney, Australia) via a glass funnel and base (Merck Millipore). For RNA extraction, a combination of two kits (RNeasy PowerWater Kit and RNeasy PowerMicrobiome Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used. A 5-mL bead tube from RNeasy PowerWater Kit was used to accommodate the electronegative membrane. A Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, France) was used to homogenize the samples at conditions ranging from 3 \u00d7 20 s at 8000 rpm at a 10 s interval. From here on RNA was extracted using RNeasy Power Microbiome kit as per manufacturer's instruction.",

Among the five assays tested, E_Sarbeco and CDC N2 assays were the most sensitive (Nalla et al., 2020). Vogels et al. (2020) showed that most RT-qPCR assays can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 by seeding SARS-CoV-2 RNA into RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs, but there are apparent differences in the ability to differentiate between true negatives and positives when concentrations are at or below ten copies/\u03bcL of RNA for China CDC N, China CDC ORF1, USA CDC N2, and USA CDC N3 assays. In this study, the level of SARS-CoV-2 in two RT-qPCR positive samples were near the lower limit of detection (i.e, amplified between 37 and 40 cycles). This may have contributed to the inconsistent results between N_Sarbeco and NIID_2019-nCOV_N assays. When the concentration of the target gene is low, subsampling error may also occur (Taylor et al., 2019). Therefore, the performance of the currently used assays needs to be cross validated by seeding SARS-CoV-2 RNA into untreated wastewater samples followed by further inter-laboratory validation. However, we could confirm the specificity of the RT-qPCR by Sanger and MiSeq Illumina sequencing. Since wastewater is a complex matrix and some assays may produce false-positive results, we recommend sequencing RT-qPCR products for confirmation.",

The electronegative membrane used in this study is typically used for concentrating enteric viruses from wastewater and environmental waters with modest recovery (Rigotto et al., 2009; Ahmed et al., 2020). The rationale for using the electronegative membrane is that greater adsorption of enveloped viruses such as mouse hepatitis virus and Pseudomonas phage \u03a66 to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to nonenveloped viruses (Ye et al., 2016). Furthermore, koi herpesvirus (i.e., an enveloped virus) showed high adsorption efficiency to the electronegative membrane (Haramoto et al., 2009). Besides the electronegative membrane, the Centricon\u00ae Plus-70 centrifugal filter has been successfully used to recover SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples in the Netherlands (Medema et al., 2020). A recent study successfully recovered SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater using a polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) concentration method (Wu et al., 2020a). None of the reported studies to date have provided information on the percent recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater due to the risk associated with handling SARS-CoV-2 and the requirements for a BSL-3 facility. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has to date reported the percent recovery of SARS-CoV from wastewater which was estimated to be only 1% using an electropositive membrane (Wang et al., 2005). Since the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are different to enteric viruses, more research is needed for the effective recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater.",

One of the biggest challenges will be to establish quantitative predictions from the viral RNA concentrations measured in the sewage to the actual numbers of cases in the community. For application of WBE of SARS-CoV-2 infection, further systematic research is needed covering aspects from effective sampling and preservation through to data interpretation. Since application may be particularly useful in remote communities and confined populations, the availability of effective sampling techniques is of obvious importance. Furthermore, we need to identify or develop effective enveloped virus concentration methods and local data on the prevalence and concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. We need robust RT-qPCR assay(s) that can measure SARS-CoV-2 in complex matrices such as wastewater with high sensitivity. It has been reported that digital RT-PCR (dRT-PCR) is more sensitive and suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens with low viral loads (Dong et al., 2020). Understanding the decay of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is also crucial in terms of their detection with RT-qPCR assays. Information on the composition of wastewater and environmental factors such as stormflow and its impact on wastewater may also be useful. These requirements are expected to be achievable and should provide accurate information on the disease burden in the community.",
