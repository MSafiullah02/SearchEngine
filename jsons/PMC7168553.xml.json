Porcine CoVs are significant enteric and respiratory pathogens of swine. Six porcine CoVs have so far been identified: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Doyle & Hutchings, 1946), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (Wesley, Woods, Hill, & Biwer, 1990), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) (Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978), and porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) (Gong et al., 2017) in the Alphacoronavirus genus; porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) (Sasseville, Boutin, Gelinas, & Dea, 2002) in the Betacoronavirus genus; porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (Woo et al., 2012) in the Deltacoronavirus genus. PEAV as the newest member was first detected by our team by genomic analysis of samples collected from a diarrhoea\u2010outbreak swine herds routinely vaccinated with PEDV vaccine in a farm in Guangdong, China in February 2017, and complete genome of the PEAV strain GDS04 was then sequenced (Gong et al., 2017).",

The S protein of CoVs is the pivotal surface glycoprotein involved in virus attachment and entry, and induction of neutralizing antibodies in vivo (Cruz, Kim, & Shin, 2008; Woo, Huang, Lau, & Yuen, 2010).

The results suggest that the isolate of PEAV GDS04 is closely related to SADS\u2010CoV and SeACoV but caused 100% mortality in neonatal piglets, indicating its potential role as pathological agent responsible for severe watery diarrhoea and death in neonatal piglets in the field case.",

Two hundred microlitres of the filtered inoculums, together with 300 \u03bcl maintenance medium was added to each well. After adsorption for 1.5 hr at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2, cells were washed three times with the maintenance medium, and then 2 ml maintenance medium was added. The cells were cultured continuously at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for cytopathic effect (CPE) observation. The plates were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C and thawed twice around 4 day postinoculation (d.p.i).

Samples collected at 0\u2010hr postinoculation and 4 d.p.i. were tested by PEAV\u2010specific RT\u2010PCR as described previously (Gong et al., 2017). The RT\u2010PCR positive samples were used as seed stocks for the next passage and plaque purification. For virus plaque purification, supernatants from virus\u2010infected cells were serially diluted and used to infect Vero cells in the maintenance medium for 1.5 hr at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and then the maintenance medium was discarded, followed by overlaying 2 ml maintenance medium containing 1.25% Agarose LM GQT (TaKaRa, Dalian) to immobilize the virus. After 24 hr, cells were fixed and visualized with 2 ml maintenance medium containing 1.25% Agarose LM GQT and 0.01% Neutral red solution (Sigma, USA). The plaques were picked by using sterile pipette tips, and the agarose plaque was placed into a microcentrifuge tube containing 0.5 ml maintenance medium. The selected plaques of PEAV were named GDS04 and used for viral propagation. Vero cells were cultured in T175 flasks, and washed three times with sterile 1\u00d7 PBS (pH 7.4) at a confluency of 90%. One mL of PEAV together with 50 ml maintenance medium was added into the flask. The cell pellets and supernatant were cultured continuously at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 to observe CPE. When CPE was evident in the inoculated cell monolayers (around 1 d.p.i.), the plates were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C and thawed twice.

Briefly, the n gene was amplified from PEAV GDS04 P12 strain using the specific primers as described above, and the PCR products were cloned into the pMD19\u2010T (TaKaRa, Dalian). The known plasmid concentration was 10\u2010fold serially diluted for generating a standard curve in each plate. The quantity of PEAV viral RNA in tested samples was calculated based on the cycle threshold (Ct) values for the standard curve.",

Furthermore, four piglets from group 2 as cohabitation controls also developed watery diarrhoea from 5 to 12 d.p.i. (Figure 4e). Since PEAV GDS04 caused severe watery diarrhoea in newborn piglets, we also recorded the mortality of newborn piglets in each group. As shown in Figure 5, in PEAV\u2010inoculated groups, except that two piglets were necropsied at 7 d.p.i., all remaining 10 piglets died from 5 to 12 d.p.i.

Since PEAV was first detected by genomic analysis in pigs (Gong et al., 2017), we attempted to isolate virus from PEAV\u2010positive samples using Vero cells. The virus could only be isolated in circumstance of inoculation with fresh homogenate in piglets. The difficulty to isolate PEAV from positive samples might be associated with the fact that positive samples characterized by RT\u2010PCR may contain noninfectious or low amount of virus. During virus isolation, the DMEM supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/ml trypsin performed better than 7 \u03bcg/ml in PEAV propagation with more evident CPE, which indicates that the amount of trypsin in Vero cells might also contribute to the successful PEAV isolation. CPE was firstly observed in inoculated Vero cells until the passage 10. After plaque purification and several passages, the viral titre reached 5.13 \u00d7 105 TCID50/ml, showing that the PEAV GDS04 strain was highly replicative in Vero cells. The plaque\u2010purified PEAV strain in Vero cells was further verified by IFA with PEAV\u2010specific mouse antisera.

We found that PEAV GDS04 P12 strain (accession no. MH697599) shares 99.79% nucleotide identity with PEAV GDS04 strain (accession no. MF167434), and compared to the complete genome of the virus in the original small intestinal homogenate, the PEAV GDS04 P12 strain possesses 35 point mutations, a 1\u2010nt deletion (A) in nt 77, a 3\u2010nt deletion (GTA) in nt 24,790\u201324,792, a 1\u2010nt deletion (A) in nt 27,071, a 1\u2010nt deletion (T) in nt 27,081, a 1\u2010nt deletion (A) in nt 27,089, a 3\u2010nt insertion (TTG) in nt 4,554\u20134,556, 10\u2010nt insertion (GACTAGAGCC) in nt 12483\u201012492, indicating that these mutations might be related to cellular adaptation. Based on the phylogenetic tree analysis of s genes, the PEAV strain GDS04 shares 36.23%\u201399.66% nucleotide identity with other 18 CoVs in GenBank. Notably, the PEAV GDS04 strains can be clustered into one clade with four bat coronavirus HKU strains from Hong Kong, a BtRf\u2010AlphaCoV strain from Beijing, SADS\u2010CoV strain from Guangdong, and SeACoV strain from Guangdong, indicating a close relationship of these strains. In addition, the PEAV GDS04 strains, SADS\u2010CoV, and SeACoV clustered into a subclade, indicating that these three viruses might have similar origins. Consistent with the results of the s genes, phylogenetic analysis of the n genes and whole\u2010genome of the PEAV GDS04 and other CoVs revealed that PEAV GDS04, SADS\u2010CoV, and SeACoV belong to the same subclade. Previous studies have shown that the s gene, the most variable region in the CoV genomes, belongs to type I membrane glycoproteins family (Woo et al., 2010) and is involved in receptor binding and viral entry (Woo et al., 2010). Sequencing of s genes revealed that GDS04 had the smallest S protein among all coronaviruses (Gong et al., 2017). Compared to the s gene of the SeACoV and SADS\u2010CoV strains, the PEAV GDS04 possesses 11 point mutations, 3 point mutations with SeACoV and SADS\u2010CoV, respectively. Whether these unique variations contribute to the efficiency of viral replication and virulence needs to be further investigated.",

As a result, we infected 5\u2010day\u2010old newborn piglets with the PEAV GDS04 strain P12 via oral feeding. The sequential severe diarrhoea and vomiting in piglets by oral infection strongly suggest the pathogenicity of PEAV to the newborn piglets. Furthermore, PEAV RNA was detected from 1 to 11 d.p.i. in faecal of GDS04 challenged piglets, while no RNA was detected in the negative control piglets. Four piglets from group 2 as cohabitation contrast also developed profuse watery diarrhoea and viral shedding, suggesting the possibility of faecal\u2013oral transmission of PEAV. Results from this study may help guide future PEAV experimental designs as the clinical diarrhoea and virus shedding patterns.",

The intestines contained higher levels of viral RNA copies compared with the other tissues, and no PEAV viral RNA was detected in the blood, indicating that PEAV might infect multiple organs in pigs, but the intestinal tract is the major target organ of PEAV. Furthermore, we confirmed that PEAV could replicate in pig intestines by EM. These results suggested that PEAV has similar infection process with other porcine CoVs like PEDV or PDCoV. Gross lesions by virus infection were obviously observed in the small intestines, caeca and colons of the 5\u2010day\u2010old piglets at necropsy at 7 d.p.i., similar to observations in PEDV or PDCoV infection (Chen et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2015). While microscopic lesions were observed in the jejunum and ileum infected by PDCoV in previous report (Chen et al., 2015), we found microscopic lesions distributed in the whole intestinal tract in GDS04 infected piglets, suggesting a more deteriorative effect by PEAV than that caused by PDCoV. What is more, no microscopic lesions were observed in any other organs of the PEAV\u2010challenged piglets (data not shown), similar to observations in PDCoV infection (Chen et al., 2015). Consistent with the histopathological results, the PEAV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes of challenged piglets by immunohistochemical analysis. This information is useful for choosing appropriate tissues for PEAV diagnostic investigations.",

            "text": "Since PEAV GDS04 caused severe watery diarrhoea in newborn piglets, we also recorded the mortality of newborn piglets from 1 to 14 d.p.i.. The pathogenicity of a SeACoV strain CH/GD/01/2017/P2 and SADS\u2010CoV in neonatal piglets were described (Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). Results showed that SeACoV and SADS\u2010CoV caused severe diarrhoea and vomiting in pigs of 3 days old. However, SeACoV infection did not cause fatality in piglets in 5 days (Pan et al., 2017), while 50% died after SADS\u2010CoV infection within the same period (Zhou et al., 2018). When infected with PEAV GDS04, one piglet died in dpi 5, and all PEAV\u2010inoculated piglets and half piglets from cohabitation contrast died in 2 weeks, indicating that PEAV GDS04 strain and SADS\u2010CoV were more pathogenic than SeACoV CH/GD/01/2017/P2. In addition, compared to the complete genome of the SeACoV CH/GD/01/2017/P2, the PEAV GDS04 P12 possesses 82 point mutations, a 1\u2010nt deletion (A) in nt 177, 10\u2010nt insertion (GACTAGAGCC) in nt 12483\u2010nt 12492, a 1\u2010nt insertion (A) in nt 27068, a 1\u2010nt insertion (T) in nt 27078, and a 1\u2010nt insertion (A) in nt 27086, presenting a clue of different pathogenicity of the two strains. And compared to the complete genome of the SADS\u2010CoV, the PEAV GDS04 P12 possesses 41 point mutations, a 1\u2010nt deletion (A) in nt 176, a 1\u2010nt insertion (A) in nt 27067, a 1\u2010nt insertion (T) in nt 27077, and a 1\u2010nt insertion (A) in nt 27085. In addition, the PEAV strain GDS04 P12 shares 99.58%, 99.66% nucleotide identity with SeACoV and SADS\u2010CoV, respectively, indicating that PEAV has more similarities with SADS\u2010CoV than SeACoV. The details of genome comparison might also help explain the high mortality rate as high as 90% in piglets in PEAV\u2010reported swine herds (Zhou et al., 2018). Together, all these results confirm that the PEAV GDS04 strain isolated in this study could cause enteric diseases and death in newborn piglets. However, there are still several important questions needed to be addressed. For instance, what is the prevalence of PEAV as a new CoV in herds? What are the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of PEAV infection? How to prepare effective vaccines against the PEAV? Elucidation of these questions will elevate our understandings of the pathogenicity of PEAV infection and help to develop better strategies to control PEAV.",

Remarkably, inoculation of newborn piglets with PEAV GDS04 P12 by oral feeding reproduced clinical symptoms, including vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhoea with a mortality of 100% in neonatal piglets. Collectively, these findings suggest that PEAV GDS04 is highly virulent in piglets.",
