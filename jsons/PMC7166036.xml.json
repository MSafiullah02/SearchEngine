Up to the time of writing this letter, the association between G6PD deficiency and novel coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019) is absent in COVID-19 reports. This absence could be because G6PD deficiency was overlooked during the current COVID\u201019 pandemic. One may argue that using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID\u201019 was less likely, as hydroxychloroquine needs to be used cautiously in G6PD deficiency [4], [5]. Another reason for this absence could be that G6PD deficiency in the countries most affected by COVID-19 is rare and/or of the mild type. In Hubei province in China, the origin of COVID-19, the incidence of G6PD deficiency is only 0.098% and about 50% of these are due to WHO class III mild type [6]. We are anticipating that a report outlining the association between G6PD deficiency and COVID\u201019 may come from countries in which severe G6PD deficiency is very common. Such report is needed urgently. In Saudi Arabia, G6PD deficiency is not included in the list of diseases requiring additional precautionary measures to reduce risk of COVID-19. As per the traditional notion, \u201cabsence of evidence is not evidence of absence\u201d, it may be prudent to include G6PD deficiency in this list.",

The above-cited ex vivo study has found that \u03b1\u2010lipoic acid can attenuate the vulnerability of G6PD-deficient cells [3]. Thus, \u03b1\u2010lipoic acid has been proposed as a treatment option for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID\u201019 [4]. Hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a treatment for COVID\u201019 and clinical trials have been started evaluating this proposal. Hydroxychloroquine has oxidative properties that could decrease glutathione levels and may cause severe hemolysis in G6PD-deficient patients [5]. If hydroxychloroquine is found to be the silver bullet for COVID\u201019, then this may be a big challenge in treating COVID\u201019 in G6PD-deficient patients. Accordingly, it is prudent to use additional precautionary measures to prevent COVID-19 from reaching G6PD-deficient individuals.",
