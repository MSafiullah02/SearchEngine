Additionally, herds commonly have contact with other cattle over the fence between neighboring herds and through occasional breaches in the fence and intermingling of herds. Disease can also be introduced through wildlife contacts and contaminated feed or water sources. Finally, herd suppliers may introduce disease to the herd as well. Rendering trucks that pick up dead animals are a particular risk because they are carrying dead animals that are at high risk for carrying infectious disease.

The risk from importing new cattle varies with the disease status of the source herd. Generally veterinarians do not have much, if any, documentation of the disease status of the source herd. If whole herd testing for particular pathogens is available from the source herd, it serves as the best evidence of disease freedom. A second source of information on disease status is documented herd health and performance records. If, for example, the herd has documented records of high reproductive performance, the likelihood of a reproductive pathogen in the herd is lessened. Similarly, if a herd has a documented biosecurity program, in addition to good performance and low morbidity and mortality levels, the risk of a significant pathogen is decreased. Source herds for semen and embryos are subject to the same concerns. Semen obtained from reputable sources that operate according to Certified Semen Services guidelines are a low risk for disease introduction, as are properly washed embryos for embryo transfer.",

When such tests are applied to individuals in populations with moderately low prevalence, the positive predictive value is low and the negative predictive value is approximately equal to 1-prevalence, so a negative test provides little information. The Johne\u2019s enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test is just such a test. Prevalence of Johne\u2019s disease in beef cows is approximately 1%. The test is only about 25% sensitive in young preclinical cows, although sensitivity increases as the disease progresses. It is a specific test, correctly identifying about 97% to 99% of negative animals. When applied to a group of animals with a 1% prevalence of disease, the positive predictive value is 8% to 20%, so 80% to 92% of the positive test results are false positives. The negative predictive value is 99.2%, an excellent value until the veterinarian remembers that he or she was 99% sure any given animal was negative before the test was run (if 1% of cows were positive, then 99% were negative). Under these circumstances the test provides little useful information for the money that was spent and potentially provides false security that Johne\u2019s disease has been excluded from the herd. Further discussion of testing issues and test application are available (see Additional Resources on p. 599; Smith, Chapter 3, and Chenoweth, Chapter 3).",

            "text": "Seroprevalence studies suggest that bovine herpes virus (BHV)-1 infection is widely distributed in cattle herds. In susceptible herds 25% to 60% of cows may abort following exposure during pregnancy. BHV causes latent infection in cattle, and these latent infections may be reactivated by stressful conditions. Because of this latent reactivation, cattle previously exposed to BHV-1 can serve as a source of infection for susceptible animals. Persistence of infection in the herd is a result of both acute infections in susceptible animals and reactivation of shedding in latently infected animals.",

            "text": "In beef cattle operations the primary risk from enteric disease is in calves. Calf diarrhea is a multifactorial disease resulting from the interaction of host, agent, and environmental factors. Numerous agents are associated with diarrhea in calves including Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Cryptosporidia, Coccidia, and potentially BVDV. They share a common fecal-oral transmission route, so the methods of controlling disease introduction and spread are also substantially common between them. Most agents of calf enteric disease are ubiquitous organisms, present in the gastrointestinal tract of a large proportion of animals within a herd. In many cases the mature animals are the reservoir and calves are exposed as they enter the herd. The difference in disease rates between herds is due to differences in management practices and generally not the presence or absence of disease agents. In beef herds Salmonella and some specific strains of E. coli are not ubiquitous but may be introduced to herds from outside making biosecurity an important issue. Introduction of calves for grafting onto cows that have lost their calves is probably the greatest risk. This is particularly true for calves purchased through auction markets.",

Numerous Salmonella serotypes can infect cattle and may originate from multiple different reservoirs. Generally it is introduced to a herd by importation of a subclinical carrier animal. Calves or adult cows purchased through salebarn channels may be of particular risk due to the extensive exposure they have had to other cull cattle. Dairy source animals may present an increased risk as compared with beef animals. Wildlife exposure may also be a source of exposure for beef operations. Anecdotal evidence in the United States suggests turkeys and geese may carry strains that can subsequently infect cattle. Salmonella are hardy in the environment and may survive for years to produce infections. Salmonella are also a zoonotic concern and clients should be warned of the potential for infection, especially if immunocompromised persons are in the household.",

            "text": "\nMycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis has been considered more of a problem in dairy cattle but is receiving increasing attention in beef herds. Sero-prevalence estimates based on ELISA serology in beef cattle have ranged from 0.4% to 3% at the individual cow level and 8% to 44% at the herd level. Prevalence is higher in dairy herds. Adult cattle imported to the herd may introduce MAP and subsequently spread it to calves, resulting in establishment in the herd. Once MAP is in the herd, biocontainment practices to control contact of calves with adult manure is critical to minimize transmission. In a beef operation efforts should be focused on keeping a clean environment so that calves are not exposed to excess adult manure on udders, around feeding areas, or in feed or water. Use of dairy animals for nurse cows, embryo recipients, or as a source of colostrum may increase risk of importing MAP to the herd. Testing individual animals before entry into the herd is not a useful technique to prevent introduction of MAP as discussed earlier under testing. Alternately, importing cattle only from herds with a whole herd testing program in place for MAP provides some level of certainty that they are negative or low-prevalence herds and can substantially decrease risk.",

Biosecurity is ideally implemented in a risk-analysis approach that assesses the risk of introducing disease, consequences of introduction (e.g., economic, reputation, labor), cost of a mitigation program, and effectiveness of the mitigation program (amount of risk is decreased). Adequate understanding of the epidemiology and ecology of the particular disease agent is necessary to strategically identify effective control points.",
