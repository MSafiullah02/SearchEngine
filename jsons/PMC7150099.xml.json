Although human beings are believed to have originated about 3\u20134 million years ago, the oldest record of virus in history was found only 4000 years ago in ancient Egypt (Fig. 1.1\n). The victim of poliovirus was inscribed in a stele. In addition, evidence of smallpox\n1\nwas found in Egyptian mummies. The earliest physical evidence of it is probably the pustular rash found on the mummified body of Pharaoh Ramses V of Egypt (1149\u20131145 BC). Smallpox was described in the literature of ancient China (700 BC) as well. It is believed that the collapse of the Inca and Aztec cultures in South America can be attributed to smallpox and measles\n2\nthat were brought by European explorers. After all, viruses have greatly influenced the fates of ancient cultures extinguished in human history.",

In 1892, Dimitri Ivanowski, a Russian scientist, reported an unexpected observation during his study on the Tobacco mosaic disease of a plant (Fig. 1.2\n). He found that the filtrates of the transmissible agent caused the disease. He modestly stated that \u201caccording to my experiments, the filtered extract introduced into healthy plants produces the symptoms of the disease just as surely as does the unfiltered sap.\u201d In the year 1898, Martinus Beijerinck, a Dutch scientist, independently made similar observations in his studies on Tobacco mosaic disease of a plant. Further, he speculated that the pathogen exists only in living tissues. He named the new pathogen virus\n3\nto highlight its nonbacterial nature. Importantly, he articulated two experimental definitions of viruses as the following: the ability to pass through a porcelain filter, and the need for living cells on which to grow. Subsequently, a similar observation was made of an animal virus as well. Loeffler and Frosch, German scientists, found a filterable agent in their studies on foot-and-mouth disease\n4\nin cows in 1897.\n",

It was the moment of discovery of the yellow fever virus (YFV) in 1902\u2014the first human virus ever isolated. In fact, the discovery of YFV involved human volunteers including colleagues of Walter Reed, some of whom unfortunately succumbed to the virus they discovered.

Louis Pasteur had earlier used rabbits for transmission of rabies for the development of rabies vaccine (see Box 25.1). Therefore, unlike yellow fever, an animal model for transmission was already available before the discovery of the etiologic agent. Nonetheless, Louis Pasteur failed to isolate and cultivate a rabies microbe in a media, in which bacterium are expected to grow. Almost two decades later in 1903, Paul Remlinger demonstrated that the filtrates of rabies inoculum transmit the disease to animals. Thus, rabies virus, a filterable agent that causes rabies in animals, was discovered. In 1908, Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian scientist, reported the transmission of poliomyelitis to monkeys, revealing the etiological agent of poliomyelitis. Overall, during the first decade of the 20th century, the etiological agents of three major viral scourages, YFV, rabies virus, and poliovirus, were discovered (see Fig. 1.3).",

            "text": "One big question that remained unanswered until the 1950s was what is the genetic material of life? A prevailing view was that protein rather than nucleic acid was more likely to be the genetic materials responsible for inheritance due to its higher diversity (ie, 20 amino acids versus 4 bases). In fact, the experiment that proved nucleic acids to be the genetic material was carried out by an experiment using bacteriophages\n7\n(ie, a virus of bacteria). Bacteriophages, which propagate rapidly in bacterial hosts, became a favorite experimental subject during 1940\u20131960. In 1952, when the identity of the genetic material was still in debate, Hershey clearly demonstrated that the nucleic acid component of bacteriophage T2 was the genetic material (Fig. 1.4\n). In his experiment, nucleic acids and proteins were radiolabeled distinctively either with 32P and 35S, respectively. Such a prepared T2 phage was used to infect a bacterium, and examined to see whether 32P or 35S was detectable in the cell pellet after centrifugation. Since T2 phage was known to inject the genetic material into the host cell, what is detected in the cell pellet represents the genetic materials. Indeed, 32P (nucleic acid) was abundantly detected in the pellet, while 35S (protein) was detected in the supernatant, revealing that the nucleic acids are the genetic materials. This work represents a seminal discovery that clearly proved that \u201cDNA is the genetic material\u201d (see Fig. 1.3).",

In their experiment, they explored the fact that TMV can be reconstituted in vitro by mixing proteins and RNA components following fractionation of TMV particles (Fig. 1.5\n). Briefly, two strains of TMV, that exhibits distinct lesions on the leaf, were employed. After separating into proteins and RNA, two hybrid viruses were reconstituted by mixing two components. These hybrid viruses were used to infect the host plant. Remarkably, the phenotype of the reconstituted hybrid viruses was determined by the RNA, but not the proteins.

Because viruses are found in almost all living organisms on earth, their biological properties should be as diverse as their host organisms. Nonetheless, five common features of viruses, regardless of their hosts, are perceived. A defining feature is that a \u201cvirus\u201d replicates only inside living cells. In other words, a \u201cvirus\u201d is simply a physical entity outside of cells, as it cannot reproduce outside of cells. More precisely speaking, what a virus really belongs to is an interface between living and nonliving matter (Box 1.1\n). Since a virus can propagate only inside host cells, it has long been referred to as \u201ca parasite living in cells.\u201d Second, a virus is \u201can infectious agent,\u201d in that it is transmissible from an infected host to uninfected hosts. Third, a virus propagates itself via assembly. In other words, the assembly of its components in infected cell is the way of multiplication, not by division as per cells. Fourth, a virus could rapidly cope with environmental changes (eg, host cell, drug, and antibodies), a property that is attributable to its higher mutation rate (see Box 1.3). Fifth, a virus is an unique organism that delivers its genome to the host cells via the process called \u201cinfection.\u201d This special feature of viruses is exploited as vehicles in gene therapy (see chapter: Virus Vectors).Box 1.1Are Viruses Alive?\u201cAre viruses alive or not?\u201d This question always provokes lively discussion. Since we are now well aware of the molecular details of virus, this question is no longer a scientific question but a somewhat philosophical question. Viruses share many features with a living organisms, such as the ability to replicate (reproduce), and the possession of inheritable materials (genome). Nonetheless, viruses can be regarded as nonliving entities, since they cannot replicate outside of host cells.",

It was a truly visionary insight that foretold the era of molecular virology. Undoubtedly, the Baltimore classification serves as a gold standard of virus classification. In addition to his contribution as a virologist, Baltimore has profoundly influenced international science, including key contributions to immunology, virology, cancer research, biotechnology, and recombinant DNA research, through his accomplishments as a researcher, administrator, educator, and public advocate for science and engineering. He shared the Nobel Prize in 1975 with Howard Temin for the discovery of reverse transcriptase (see Box 17.1) at the age of only 37. Even afterward, he continued to be productive as a research scientist not only in virology but also in the field of immunology. He is also well known as the discoverer of transcription factor NF-kB. In addition, his contribution extended to his role as a university administrator. He has served as the president of California Institute of Technology (Caltech) from 1997 to 2006. He is currently the President Emeritus and Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology at Caltech.\n",

            "text": "All living organisms on earth employ DNA as a genome. In contrast, viruses employ either DNA or RNA as a genome. Having a more flexible RNA molecule as a genome, RNA viruses exhibit a higher mutation rate (Box 1.3\n). Consequently, RNA viruses can mutate or evolve rapidly upon antiviral stresses, such as host immune response and treatment of antiviral drugs. Not surprisingly, the majority of newly emerging viruses are RNA viruses (see chapter: New Emerging Viruses).\nBox 1.3Viral Genome and MutationOne of the salient features that distinguish viruses from other organisms is the higher rate of mutation. The mutation rates of eukaryotic organisms are considerably lower, ranging from 10\u22128 to 10\u221210, since proofreading capability (10\u22123) takes largely care of most of the errors. In the case of viruses, the mutation rates are significantly higher than host organisms, because viral DNA/RNA polymerases are not equipped with proofreading capability. Moreover, the genomic features also affect the mutation rates. For instance, the mutation rates of RNA viruses (10\u22123 to 10\u22125) are significantly higher than those of DNA viruses (10\u22126 to 10\u22128). In other words, the RNA virus with 10 kb genome size has at least one or more mutation per genome per replication cycle. RNA being more flexible than DNA, RNA viruses have intrinsically higher mutation rates. On the other hand, in the case of DNA virus, single-stranded DNA viruses have higher mutation rates than double-stranded DNA viruses. Note that the mutation rate of retroviruses are lower than that of single-stranded RNA viruses, but comparable to that of single-stranded DNA viruses.What is the biological implication of having a higher mutation rate? A living organism has to cope with environmental changes via a process called \u201cadaptation\u201d or \u201cevolution.\u201d Mutation is the driving force for evolution. In other words, mutations are not always harmful, but can be beneficial to an organism. Being random events, the vast majority of mutations lead to the loss of gene function. Some of the mutations, at least, can be advantageous for the virus to survive in challenging environments. The process of outgrowth of a virus having such advantageous mutations is termed \u201cselection\u201d or \u201cadaptation.\u201d Therefore, the emergence of viral mutants (ie, variants) is the consequence of not only mutation but also selection. Selection constitutes an important concept in understanding viral evolution.\n",

            "text": "As described earlier, this book deals only with human viruses. In fact, viruses are discovered in almost all organisms on earth, including animals, plants, insects, amoeba, plankton, and bacteria. Here, it is worth noting what kinds of viruses are found in such diverse organisms. Table 1.3\nincludes only one or two viral species per organism for brevity, which is only the tip of the iceberg. For instance, plant viruses are found in many agricultural products, such as rice, corns, potato, and tobacco (Fig. 1.10\n). Pathogenic plant viruses damage the crops, resulting in significant economic loss in the farming industry. Interestingly, viruses do not always cause disease in host organisms. For instance, tulip breaking virus does not cause pathogenic lesion on the host plant but leaves a beautiful stripe pattern on the flower that is appreciated by people (Box 1.4\n). Notably, many plant viruses constitute \u201cfamilies\u201d that do not have a counterpart in animal viruses. For instance, TMV is classified in the \u201cVirgavirus family,\u201d and cauliflower mosaic virus is classified in the \u201cCaulimovirus family,\u201d neither of which have any animal members (Table 1.3).Box 1.4Tulip Breaking VirusTulip breaking virus (TBV), also known as tulip mosaic virus, is a plant virus. In peculiar, TBV infection of tulip leaves a stripe pattern without pathogenic lesions on the host. Tulips with the stripe pattern were once sold at extraordinarily high prices, which was about 10 times the annual income of average workers during the so-called Tulip mania period during the 17th century in the Netherlands. Of course, the stripe pattern was highly valued for its artistic beauty, without knowing it was the result of a viral infection. In fact, TBV belongs to the potyvirus family (see Table 1.3). The stripe pattern is believed to be the result of bleaching caused by TBV infection.\n",

Recently, giant viruses\n10\n, which are an extraordinary size (400 nm in diameter), were discovered in amoeba (Box 1.5\n). The genome size of \u201cMimivirus,\u201d the first giant virus discovered, is about 1200 kb, which is five times larger than any other known virus (ie, 230 kb of cytomegalovirus). It even rivals some bacteria in the genome size. After all, the discovery of giant viruses in amoeba makes the distinction between virus and organism blurred.\nBox 1.5Giant Virus and VirophageAttention is paid to the discovery of two giant viruses in amoeba that lie beyond the classical definition of virus. The first giant virus discovered in 2003 was named \u201cmimivirus.\u201d The name derived from \u201cmimicking microbes.\u201d It was initially mistaken by Jean-Michel Claverie as a microbe and left in his freezer for 10 years, since its size nearly parallels the microbe (~400 nm) under microscope. In fact, its genome size is 1200 kb, which is five times larger than herpesvirus, which is known to have the largest genome among viruses. And it encodes 1200 genes. Considering the genome size and the number of genes it encodes, mimivirus is closer to a microbe than a virus.Recently, Jean-Michel Claverie discovered another giant virus, named \u201cmamavirus.\u201d An interesting twist in this discovery is that another virus was found inside the giant mamavirus. In other word, a satellite virus of giant virus was discovered, which is packaged inside the host virus. Although satellite viruses were previously reported in other organisms, this is the first example where the satellite virus is found packaged inside host virus particles. The satellite virus is now called \u201cSputnik,\u201d named after the first man-made satellite. It has a 18 kb DNA genome, which encodes 21 genes (Table Box 1.5\n). Interestingly, Sputnik-infected mamavirus was somewhat attenuated in progeny production and morphologically distorted. Briefly put, Sputnik makes its host sick. Moreover, the satellite virus of the giant virus is now dubbed a \u201cvirophage,\u201d as an analogy to the bacteriophage. Jean-Michel Claverie wittily added that \u201cThe discovery of virophage makes \u2018virus\u2019 more living organisms.\u201d Paradoxically, \u201cbeing sick\u201d can be said to be the evidence of \u201cliving.\u201d It was the first report that a virus particle was found packaged inside a host virus, which is already acting as a parasite of the host organism.\n",

In 1898, Martinus Beijerinck (1851\u20131931), independently reproduced Ivanowski\u2019s filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant (below).
