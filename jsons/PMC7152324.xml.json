Treatment is usually continued until the viral load is undetectable for 2 weeks, then the patient is switched to 1 to 3 months of prophylactic therapy.

However, CMV D+/R+ group and not the D+/R- group has the worst graft and patient survival at 3 years. This could be secondary to increased vigilance in monitoring the CMV D+/- group.5.Epstein-Barr virus can flourish in the setting of immunosuppression and is associated with the majority of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.6.Live vaccines are contraindicated post transplant.\n\n\n",
