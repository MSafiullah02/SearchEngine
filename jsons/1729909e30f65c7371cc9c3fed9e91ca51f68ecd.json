For some diseases, such as dengue fever, the serotypes interact by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which infection with a single serotype is asymptomatic, but contact with a second serotype leads to higher viral load and greater infectivity. We present and analyze a dynamic compartmental model for multiple serotypes exhibiting ADE. Using center manifold techniques, we show how the dynamics rapidly collapses to a lower dimensional system. Using the constructed reduced model, we can explain previously observed synchrony between certain classes of primary and secondary infectives (Schwartz et al. in Phys Rev E 72:066201, 2005). Additionally, we show numerically that the center manifold equations apply even to noisy systems. Both deterministic and stochastic versions of the model enable prediction of asymptomatic individuals that are difficult to track during an epidemic. We also show how this technique may be applicable to other multistrain disease models, such as those with cross-immunity.",

Examples of persistent co-circulating multistrain diseases include influenza [1] , malaria [12] , and dengue fever [11] . More recently, the avian flu viruses, including H5N1, were reported to coexist in several genotypes until 2004 [17] . Other examples of viruses possessing multiple strains may be seen in corona viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [18] . The presence of multiple strains adds greater complication to models of disease dynamics due to an increasing number of stages through different infectionrecovery combinatorics. Reducing the dimensionality of the model is desirable, both to obtain a simpler model and to understand how the strains interact.",

Models of multistrain steady state endemic behavior and its stability were considered for two strains in [9] , where both mosquito population and humans were included. Although ADE was not explicitly modeled, the authors did consider different parameter values of contact susceptibility. Values of contact susceptibility less than unity model cross-immunity, whereas values greater than unity model increased susceptibility due to secondary infection. Ferguson et al. [10] modeled two serotypes of dengue and showed that ADE can lead to oscillations and chaotic behavior. Schwartz et al. [15] developed a similar model with non-overlapping compartments for greater ease of interpretation. The bifurcation structure was obtained for both the autonomous model and a model with seasonal forcing. Chaotic solutions were found for a wide range of parameter values. It was observed from numerical simulations that outbreaks of the four serotypes could occur asynchronously but that certain primary and secondary infective compartments remained synchronized. In particular, all compartments currently infected with a particular strain exhibited in-phase outbreaks. Cummings et al., [5] using the same model, explored the competitive advantage that ADE confers to viruses. Other models for dengue fever (e.g., [8] ) have included the mosquito vector as in [9] but have not included the ADE effect.",

Our analysis motivates the in-phase behavior previously reported for primary and secondary infectives. The lower dimensional system allows the prediction of primary infective levels from knowledge of other compartment values. This result may be useful in disease monitoring because little epidemiological data exists for the asymptomatic primary infectives. We show numerically that our predictions hold even in noisy systems. We also discuss the relevance of this technique to other multistrain diseases that do not display ADE, such as influenza, in which infection with one strain yields partial immunity to other strains.",

Rates of infection due to primary infectives are of the form \u03b2sx i , as in a standard SIR model, while infection rates due to secondary infectives are weighted by the appropriate \u03c6, taking the form \u03b2\u03c6 j sx ij . When \u03c6 = 1, there is no ADE, and both primary and secondary infectives are equally infectious. When \u03c6 > 1, the ADE appears as an enhancement factor in the nonlinear terms involving secondary infectives. Although the contact rate \u03b2 could be time dependent (e.g., due to seasonal fluctuations in the mosquito vector population), we assume it to be constant here for simplicity. The fixed parameters throughout the paper are given by: \u00b5 = 0.02, \u00b5 d = 0 or \u00b5 d = 0.02, \u03b2 = 400, and \u03c3 = 100, all with units of years \u22121 .

The dynamics with \u00b5 d = 0 are qualitatively similar to that with \u00b5 d = 0.02 and have the same bifurcation structure. We demonstrate numerically that our results hold well even for the system with mortality. Setting \u00b5 d = 0 in Eqs. 1-4 still permits death to occur in the classes that have recovered from a secondary infection. For a disease such as dengue, for which the mortality rate is low and the average age at infection is believed to be fairly young [13] , this assumption is physically reasonable.

From serotype measurements of these hospital cases, estimation of the number of secondary infectives that have a particular serotype i should be possible. On the other hand, there is little epidemiological data on the frequency of primary infections because patients with primary infections tend not to be as seriously ill and are not admitted to hospitals. They are typically considered asymptomatic.

This model differs from the ADE model in that rather than giving the secondary infectives a different infectivity (weighted by \u03c6), we give the primary recovereds a different susceptibility to further infection (weighted by \u03c8) than the susceptible compartment. Using the coordinate transformation given in Eq. 8 (setting \u03c6 = 1), we can reduce Eqs. 45-48 from 7 to 5 equations and show a relationship between primary and secondary infectives. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian corresponding to rapidly collapsing directions are n(n \u2212 1) eigenvalues equal to \u2212\u03c3 , the recovery rate. The center manifold analysis holds because the recovery rate is rapid compared to the birth rate. It seems reasonable to expect that other models with crossimmunity might also be reduced and a relationship between primary, secondary, and perhaps higher order infectives might be derived. Because cross-immunity models are often written in a different form with overlapping compartments (e.g., [1, 6, 8] ), some reformulation of the equations may be necessary before a center manifold approach can be used. The results presented here were primarily for a symmetric multistrain model with equal disease parameters for each strain. However, the case of unequal ADE factors was briefly considered, and a center manifold was found when the difference between ADE factors was a small parameter (Eqs. 26-27). To model a multistrain disease with realistic parameters, it may be necessary to relax the symmetry constraint and derive results for an asymmetric system. Such a derivation is unwieldy because the endemic steady state can no longer be determined analytically (except as an approximate expansion). New techniques may be necessary to extend our current approach to more asymmetric models.",
