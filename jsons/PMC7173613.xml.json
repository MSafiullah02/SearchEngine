Intestinal epithelial cells have receptors for bacterial products and produce chemokines (e.g., interleukin [IL]-8, monocyte chemotactic protein type 1 [MCP-1], granulocyte macrophage-cell stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], IL-1) in response to invasion by enteropathogens.30 The gut epithelium orchestrates the immune response. However, in the newborn, phagocytic, chemotactic, and complement functions are immature. B and T lymphocyte functions are impaired, resulting in a preferential IgM production in response to antigenic stimulation. IgG is actively transferred from mother to infant across the placenta at about 32 weeks\u2019 gestation and peaks by about 37 weeks; premature neonates, especially those born before 28 weeks\u2019 gestation, are deficient in these maternally derived serum antibodies.31\n",

Despite extremely poor sanitation and the demonstration of fecal organisms in the colostrum and milk of almost one third of mothers,46 diarrheal disease did not occur in any newborns. The incidence of diarrhea rose significantly only after these infants reached 4 to 6 months old, at which time solids and other fluids were used to supplement the human milk feedings. At that time, Escherichia coli and gram-negative anaerobes (e.g., Bacteroides) were found to colonize the intestinal tract.13 In contrast, urban infants of a similar ethnic background who were partly or totally artificially fed frequently acquired diarrheal disease caused by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC).",

            "text": "Multiple mechanisms by which breast-feeding protects against diarrhea have been postulated. Breast-feeding confers protection by active components in milk and by decreased exposure to organisms present on or in contaminated bottles, food, or water. Many protective components have been identified in human milk and generally are classified as belonging to the major categories of cells, antibody, anti-inflammatory factors, and glycoconjugates and other nonantibody factors.47,\n48,\n49,\n50 Examples of milk antibodies are summarized in Table 20\u20131. For any given pathogen, multiple milk factors may help protect the infant. Human milk typically targets a major pathogenic mechanism using multiple, redundant strategies. Redundancy of milk protective factors and targeting of complex virulence machinery have created a formidable barrier to enteropathogens. Despite the fact that pathogens can rapidly divide and mutate, milk continues to protect infants. For example, human milk has secretory antibodies to Shigella virulence antigens and lipopolysaccharides,51,\n52 neutral glycolipid Gb3 to bind Shiga toxin,53,\n54 and lactoferrin to disrupt and degrade the surface-expressed virulence antigens.55,\n56,\n57 In a similar way, milk contains antibodies directed toward the surface expressed virulence antigens of EPEC,58 oligosaccharides that block cell attachment,59 and lactoferrin that disrupts and degrades the surface expressed EPEC antigens.60 Human milk can initiate and maintain the growth of Bifidobacterium and low pH in the feces of newborn infants, creating an environment antagonistic to the growth of E. coli.13,\n17,\n18,\n61\n",

Human milk contains a larger quantity of the oligosaccharides than does milk from other mammals, and its composition is singularly complex.75 The metabolic fate of the oligosaccharides is of interest. Only water, lactose, and lipids are present in greater amounts than the oligosaccharides. Despite the fact that substantial energy must be expended by the mother to synthesize the many hundreds of different milk oligosaccharides, the infant does not use them as food. Most of the oligosaccharides pass through the gut undigested.76,\n77 It is thought that they are present primarily to serve as receptor analogues that misdirect enteropathogen attachment factors away from gut epithelial carbohydrate receptors. Likewise, enteropathogens use the oligosaccharide portion of glycolipids and glycoproteins as targets for attachment of whole bacteria and toxins. Evidence is emerging that these glycoconjugates may have an important role in protection of the breast-fed infant from disease.48\n",

Ingestion of 108 to 1010 human ETEC isolates that produce LT and ST or ST alone resulted in a 30% to 80% attack rate of mild to moderate diarrheal illnesses within 12 to 56 hours that lasted 1 to 3 days.117 These illnesses, typical for traveler\u2019s diarrhea, were manifested by malaise, anorexia, abdominal cramps, and sometimes explosive diarrhea. Nausea and vomiting occur relatively infrequently, and up to one third of patients may have a low-grade fever. Although illnesses usually resolve spontaneously within 1 to 5 days, they occasionally may persist for 1 week or longer. The diarrhea is noninflammatory, without fecal leukocytes or blood. In outbreaks in infants and neonates, the duration has been in the same range (1 to 11 days), with a mean of approximately 4 days.",

Although the ability of E. coli to produce enterotoxins may be lost or transmitted to other strains, there is a tendency for the enterotoxin plasmids to occur among certain predominant serotypes, as shown in Table 20\u20132.132 These serotypes differ from EPEC or invasive serotypes, but their demonstration does not prove that they are enterotoxigenic. The only definitive way to identify ETEC is to demonstrate the enterotoxin itself by a specific gene probe for the toxin codon, by a bioassay such as tissue culture or ileal loop assays for LT or the suckling mouse assay for ST, or in the case of LT, by immunoassay such as ELISA. However, even these sensitive bioassays are limited by the unavailability of any selective media for detecting ETEC by culture. Even though substantial improvements have been made in enterotoxin assay (particularly for LT), the necessary random selection of E. coli from a relatively nonselective stool culture plate resulted in a sensitivity of only 43% of epidemiologically incriminated cases in an outbreak when 5 to 10 isolates were randomly picked and tested for enterotoxigenicity.189 By also examining paired serum samples for antibody against LT, only 36% demonstrated significant serum antibody titer rises, for a total sensitivity of ETEC isolation or serum antibody titer rises of only 64%. Some have suggested that isolates may be pooled for LT or ST assay. The capacity to prove with radiolabeled or enzyme-tagged oligonucleotide gene sequences for the enterotoxins (LT or ST) further facilitates the identification of enterotoxigenic organisms.194,\n195 A novel method of combining immunomagnetic separation (using antibody-coated magnetic beads) followed by DNA or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probing may enhance the sensitivity of screening fecal or food specimens for ETEC or other pathogens.196,\n197\n",

One study using 150 O antisera to identify as many E. coli as possible in fecal cultures showed a correlation between the coliform flora in 66% of mother-infant pairs.263 Of particular interest was the observation that the O groups of E. coli isolated from the infants\u2019 mucus immediately after delivery correlated with those subsequently recovered from their stools, supporting the contention that these organisms were acquired orally at the time of birth. In mothers whose stools contained the same O group as their offspring, the mean time from rupture of membranes to delivery was about 2 hours longer than in those whose infants did not acquire the same serogroups, suggesting that ascending colonization before birth also can play a role in determining the newborn\u2019s fecal flora.",

The release of infants who are in the incubation stages of their illness or are convalescent carriers about to relapse may lead to secondary cases of diarrheal disease among young siblings living in widely scattered areas.238,\n239,\n243 These children further disseminate infection to neighboring households, involving playmates of their own age, young infants, and mothers.238,\n239,\n242 As the sickest of these contact cases are admitted to different hospitals, they contaminate new susceptible persons, completing the cycle and compounding the outbreak. This feedback mechanism has proved to be a means of spreading infantile gastroenteritis through entire cities,238,\n239,\n242 counties,239,\n285,\n290 and even provinces.240 One major epidemic of diarrhea related to EPEC O111:B4 that occurred in the metropolitan Chicago and northwestern Indiana region during the winter of 1961 involved more than 1300 children and 29 community hospitals during a period of 9 months.240,\n291 Almost all of the patients were younger than 2 years old, and 10% were younger than 1 month, producing an age-specific attack rate of nearly 4% of neonates in the community. The importance of the hospital as a source of cross-infection in this epidemic was demonstrated through interviews with patients\u2019 families, indicating that a minimum of 40% of infants had direct or indirect contact with a hospital shortly before the onset of their illness.",

In a cohort of 63 mothers and their infants followed from birth to 3 months old, Cooper and associates85 were able to show a far higher incidence of clinical EPEC disease in infants of EPEC-negative mothers than in infants born of mothers with EPEC isolated from stool cultures. This finding suggested to the investigators the possibility that mothers harboring EPEC in their gastrointestinal tracts transfer specific antibodies to their infants that confer some protection during the first weeks of life.",

The severity of intestinal lesions at the time of death does not correlate with the birth weight of the patient, the age of onset of illness, the serogroup of the infecting strain, or the prior administration of oral or systemic antimicrobial agents. The suggestion that the intensity of inflammatory changes may depend on the duration of the diarrhea319 cannot be corroborated in autopsy studies215,\n264,\n335 or small intestinal biopsies.336,\n337 It is difficult to reconcile such a thesis with the observation that a wide range of intestinal findings can be seen at autopsy among newborns infected by a single serotype of EPEC during an epidemic. The nonspecific pathologic picture described by some researchers includes capillary congestion and edema of the bowel wall and an increase in the number of eosinophils, plasma cells, macrophages, and mononuclear cells in the mucosa and submucosa.262,\n319,\n335 Villous patterns are generally well preserved, although some flattening and broadening of the villi are seen in the more severe cases. Almost complete absence of villi and failure of regeneration of small bowel mucosa have been reported in an extreme case.338 Edema in and around the myenteric plexuses of Auerbach, a common associated finding, has been suggested as a cause of the gastrointestinal tract dilatation often seen at autopsy in infants with EPEC infections.247,\n335,\n339 In general, the distal small intestine shows the most marked alterations; however, the reported pathologic findings may be found at all levels of the intestinal tract.",

            "text": "When infants are exposed to EPEC, a significant number become colonized as temporary stool85,\n88,\n231 or pharyngeal238 carriers with no signs of clinical disease. Although Laurell340 showed that the percentage of asymptomatic infections rises steadily as age increases, this observation has not been confirmed by other investigators.214,\n341 Similarly, the suggestion that prematurity per se is associated with a low incidence of inapparent EPEC infection has been documented in several clinical studies262,\n264,\n265 but refuted in others.252,\n279 Most neonates who acquire infection with EPEC eventually show some clinical evidence of gastroenteritis. The incubation period is quite variable. Its duration has been calculated mostly from evidence in outbreaks in newborn nurseries, where the time of first exposure can be clearly defined in terms of birth or admission dates. In these circumstances, almost all infants show signs of illness between 2 and 12 days after exposure, and most cases show signs within the first 7 days.215,\n231,\n264 In some naturally acquired85,\n86 and experimental306 infections with heavy exposure, the incubation period may be as short as 24 hours; the stated upper limit is 20 days.232,\n343 The first positive stool culture and the earliest recognizable clinical signs of disease occur simultaneously in most infants,264,\n266 although colonization may precede symptoms by 7 to 14 days.265,\n266,\n344 The gastroenteritis associated with EPEC infection in the newborn is notable for its marked variation in clinical pattern. Clinical manifestations vary from mild illness manifest only by transient anorexia and failure to gain weight to a sudden explosive fulminating diarrhea causing death within 12 hours of onset. Prematurity, underlying disease, and congenital anomalies often are associated with the more severe forms of illness.214,\n233,\n345,\n346 Experienced clinicians have observed that the severity of EPEC gastroenteritis has declined markedly during the past 3 decades.225 The onset of illness usually is insidious, with vague signs of reluctance to feed, lethargy, spitting up of formula, mild abdominal distention, or even weight loss that may occur for 1 or 2 days before the first loose stool is passed. Diarrhea usually begins abruptly. It may be continuous and violent, or in milder infections, it may run an intermittent course with 1 or more days of normal stools followed by 1 or more days of diarrhea. Emesis sometimes is a prominent and persistent early finding. Stools are loose and bright yellow initially, later becoming watery, mucoid, and green. Flecks or streaks of blood, which are commonly seen with enterocolitis caused by Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Shigella, are rarely a feature of EPEC diarrheal disease. A characteristic seminal smell may pervade the environment of infants infected with EPEC O111:B34,232,\n262,\n347 and an odor variously described as \u201cpungent,\u201d \u201cmusty,\u201d or \u201cfetid\u201d often surrounds patients excreting other strains in their stools.231,\n256 Because the buttocks are repeatedly covered with liquid stools, excoriation of the perianal skin can be an early and persistent problem. Fever is an inconstant feature, and when it occurs, the patient\u2019s temperature rarely rises above 39\u00b0 C. Convulsions occur infrequently; their occurrence should alert the clinician to the possible presence of electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypernatremia. Prolonged hematochezia, distention, edema, and jaundice are ominous signs and suggest an unfavorable prognosis.215,\n240,\n285 Most infants receiving antimicrobial agents orally show a cessation of diarrhea, tolerate oral feedings, and resume weight gain within 3 to 7 days after therapy has been started.242,\n245 Those with mild illness who receive no treatment can continue to have intermittent loose stools for 1 to 3 weeks. In one outbreak related to EPEC O142:K86, more than one third of the untreated or inappropriately treated infants had diarrhea for more than 14 days in the absence of a recognized enteric pathogen on repeated culturing.267 Recurrence of diarrhea and vomiting after a period of initial improvement is characteristic of EPEC enteritis.191,\n239,\n240 Although seen most often in newborns who have been treated inadequately or not treated at all, clinical relapses also occur after appropriate therapy. Occasionally, the signs of illness during a relapse can be more severe than those accompanying the initial attack of illness.215,\n232,\n285 Not all clinical relapses result from persistent infection. A significant number of relapses, particularly those that consistently follow attempts at reinstitution of formula feedings,262,\n265 are caused by disaccharide intolerance rather than bacterial proliferation. Intestinal superinfections, caused by another serotype of EPEC283,\n347,\n348 or by completely different enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella or Shigella,\n245 also can delay the resolution of symptoms. Rarely, infants suffer a \u201crelapse\u201d caused by an organism from the same O group as the original strain but differing in its H antigen. Unless complete serotyping is performed on all EPEC isolates, such an event easily could be dismissed as being a recurrence rather than a superinfection with a new organism.258,\n268\n",

Virtually all deaths directly attributable to the intestinal infection are caused by disturbances in fluids and electrolytes. When stools are frequent in number, large in volume, and violent in release, as they often are in severe infections with abrupt onset, a neonate can lose up to 15% of body weight in a few hours.232,\n276 Rarely, fluid excretion into the lumen of the bowel proceeds so rapidly that reduction of circulating blood volume and shock may intervene before passage of even a single loose stool.262 Before the discovery of the etiologic agent, epidemic diarrhea of the newborn was also known by the term cholera infantum.\n",

Identification of these genes can be accomplished by molecular methods (discussed later), but lack of access to these methods has led many labs to rely on surrogate markers, such as serotyping.19 Classic EPEC has been recovered from the vomitus, stool, or bowel contents of infected newborns. Isolation from bile233 and the upper respiratory tract85,\n238,\n239 has been described in those instances in which a specific search has been made. Less commonly, EPEC is isolated from ascetic fluid252 or purulent exudates209,\n215,\n294; occasionally, the organism has been recovered from blood cultures,265,\n278 urine,265 and cerebrospinal fluid. Stool cultures generally are more reliable than rectal swabs in detecting the presence of enteric pathogens, although a properly obtained swab should be adequate to demonstrate EPEC in most cases.217,\n296,\n354 Specimens should be obtained as early in the course of the illness as possible because organisms are present in virtually pure culture during the acute phase of the enteritis but diminish in numbers during convalescence. Because of the preponderance of EPEC in diarrheal stools, two cultures are adequate for isolation of these pathogens in almost all cases of active disease. Studies using fluorescent antibody methods for identification of EPEC in stool specimens have demonstrated that during the incubation period of the illness, during convalescence, and among asymptomatic carriers of EPEC, organisms can be excreted in such small numbers that they escape detection by standard bacteriologic methods in a significant proportion of infants.245,\n355,\n356 As many as 3 to 10 specimens may be required to detect EPEC using methods that identify individual EPEC isolates in the stool.85,\n346 After a stool specimen is received, it should be plated as quickly as possible onto noninhibiting media or placed in a preservative medium if it is to be held for longer periods. Deep freezing of specimens preserves viable EPEC when a prolonged delay in isolation is necessary.218 No selective media, biochemical reactions, or colonial variations permit differentiation of pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains. Certain features may aid in the recognition of two important serogroups. Cultures of serogroups O111:B4 and O55:B5, unlike many other coliforms, are sticky or stringy when picked with a wire loop and are rarely hemolytic on blood agar,217,\n219 whereas O111:B4 colonies emit a distinctive evanescent odor commonly described as \u201cseminal.\u201d210,\n214 This unusual odor first led Bray347 to suspect that specific strains of E. coli might be responsible for infantile gastroenteritis.",

Organisms that do not possess flagellar antigens are nonmotile (designated NM). The EPEC B capsular surface antigen prevents agglutination by antibodies directed against the underlying O antigen.

Mixed cultures with two or three serotypes of EPEC have been demonstrated in 1% to 10% of patients.244,\n245,\n352 This need not mean that two or three serotypes are causative agents. Secondary infection with hospital-acquired strains can occur during convalescence,173,\n281,\n283,\n380 and some infants may have been asymptomatic carriers of one serotype at the time that another produced diarrheal disease. A similar explanation may pertain to mixed infections with EPEC and Salmonella or Shigella.\n217,\n220,\n358 Nelson245 reported the presence of these pathogens in combination with EPEC in 14% of infants who were cultured as part of an antibiotic therapy trial. Salmonella and Shigella that had not been identified on cultures obtained at admission were isolated only after institution of oral therapy with neomycin. The investigator postulated that the alteration in bowel flora brought about by the neomycin facilitated the growth of these organisms, which had previously been suppressed and obscured by coliform overgrowth.245 The importance of seeking all enteric pathogens in primary and follow-up cultures of infantile diarrhea is apparent, particularly when the specimen originates from a patient in a newborn nursery or infants\u2019 ward.",

Breaking the chain of fecal-oral transmission by administering antimicrobial agents simultaneously to all carriers of EPEC and their immediate contacts in the nursery has appeared to be valuable in terminating outbreaks that have failed to respond to more conservative measures.234,\n264,\n372 The apparent reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with oral administration of neomycin,230,\n233,\n234 colistin,246,\n267,\n285 polymyxin,242 or gentamicin246 during nursery epidemics has led to the impression that these drugs also exert a beneficial clinical effect in severely or moderately ill infants. Reports describing clinical,256 bacteriologic,265 or histopathologic319 evidence of tissue invasion by EPEC have persuaded some investigators to suggest the use of parenteral rather than oral drug therapy in debilitated or malnourished infants. On the basis of these data, there appears to be sufficient evidence to recommend oral administration of nonabsorbable antibiotics in the treatment of severely or moderately ill newborns with EPEC gastroenteritis. The drug most frequently used for initial therapy is neomycin sulfate in a dosage of 100mg/kg/day administered orally every 8 hours in three divided doses.245 In communities in which neomycin-resistant EPEC has been prevalent, treatment with colistin sulfate or polymyxin B in a dosage of 15 to 20mg/kg/day orally and divided into three equal doses may be appropriate. However, it is rarely necessary to use this approach.",

All infants hospitalized with diarrhea should have a bacteriologic evaluation. If the laboratory is equipped and staffed to perform fluorescent antibody testing, infants transferred from another institution to a newborn, premature, or intensive care nursery and all infants with gastroenteritis on admission during an outbreak of EPEC diarrhea or in a highly endemic area can be held in an observation area for 1 or 2 hours until the results of the fluorescent antibody test or PCR are received. Because of the difficulty in diagnosing EPEC infection, reference laboratories, such as those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), should be notified when an outbreak is suspected. Infants suspected to be excreting EPEC, even if healthy in appearance, then can be separated from others and given oral therapy until the test results are negative. Some experts have suggested that when the rapid results obtainable with fluorescent antibody procedures are not available, all infants admitted with diarrhea in a setting where EPEC is common may be treated as if they were excreting EPEC or some other enteric pathogen until contrary proof is obtained.372 Stool cultures should be obtained at admission, and contact precautions should be enforced among all who come into contact with the infant. Additional epidemiologic studies are needed to establish the advantages of careful isolation and nursing techniques, particularly in smaller community hospitals in which the number of infants in a \u201cgastroenteritis ward\u201d may be small. The use of prophylactic antibiotics has been shown to be of no value and can select for increased resistance.377,\n378,\n379\n",

Specific procedures have been suggested for handling a suspected outbreak of bacterial enteritis in a newborn nursery or infant care unit.235,\n355,\n380 Evidence indicating that a significant proportion of E. coli enteritis may be caused by nontypeable strains has required some modification of these earlier recommendations. The following infection control measures may be appropriate:1.The unit is closed, when possible, to all new admissions.2.Cultures for enteric pathogens are obtained from nursing personnel assigned to the unit at the time of the outbreak.3.Stool specimens obtained from all infants in the nursery can be screened by the fluorescent antibody or another technique and cultured. Identification of a classic enteropathogenic serotype provides a useful epidemiologic marker; however, failure to isolate one of these strains does not eliminate the possibility of illness caused by a nontypeable EPEC.4.Antimicrobial therapy with oral neomycin or colistin can be considered for all infants with a positive fluorescent antibody test or culture result. The initial drug of choice depends on local patterns of susceptibility. Depending on the results of susceptibility tests, subsequent therapy may require modification.5.If an identifiable EPEC strain is isolated, second and third stool specimens from all infants in the unit are reexamined by the fluorescent antibody technique or culture at 48-hour intervals. If this is not practical, exposed infants should be carefully followed.6.Early discharge for healthy, mature, uninfected infants is advocated.7.An epidemiologic investigation should be performed to seek the factor or factors responsible for the outbreak. A surveillance system may be established for all those in contact with the nursery, including physicians and other health care personnel, housekeeping personnel, and postpartum mothers with evidence of enteric disease. A telephone, mail, or home survey may be conducted on all infants who were residing in the involved unit during the 2 weeks before the outbreak.8.When all patients and contacts are discharged and control of the outbreak is achieved, a thorough terminal disinfection of the involved nursery is mandatory.\n",

Diagnosis of STEC diarrhea is made by isolation and identification of the pathogen in the feces. E. coli O157:H7 does not ferment sorbitol, and this biochemical trait is commonly used in the detection of this serotype.98,\n399 Because some nonpathogenic E. coli share this characteristic, confirmation of the serotype by slide agglutination is required. These techniques can be performed in most clinical laboratories. However, detection of non-O157 serotypes is problematic and relies on detection of the Shiga toxin; available methods include Shiga toxin ELISA, latex agglutination, and molecular methods.98,\n399 These should be performed by a reference laboratory.",

Biochemical traits are used routinely by hospital laboratories to differentiate S. typhi, S. choleraesuis, and S. enteritidis from each other. S. typhi is unlike other salmonellae in that it does not produce gas from glucose.438 Because there are several thousand serotypes included in the species S. enteritidis, serotyping of S. enteritidis is usually performed by state health departments rather than by hospital laboratories. The most common serogroups and representative serotypes are listed in Table 20\u20133. Infection of humans with the other serogroups (e.g., C3, D2, E2, E3, F, G, H, I) is uncommon.\n",

It is not completely clear how the organisms have adapted to survive in the harsh intracellular environment, but their survival has major clinical significance. It accounts for relapses after therapy. It explains the inadequacy of some antimicrobial agents that do not penetrate phagolysosomes. It perhaps is the reason for prolonged febrile courses that occur even in the face of appropriate therapy. Although humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity are stimulated during Salmonella infections, it is believed that cell-mediated immunity plays a greater role in eradication of the bacteria.453 T cell activation of macrophages appears to be important in killing intracellular Salmonella.\n454 Defective interferon-\u03b3 production by monocytes of newborns in response to S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide may explain in part the unusual susceptibility of infants to Salmonella infection.455 Studies in mice suggest that helper T cell (TH1) responses in Peyer\u2019s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes may be central to protection of the intestinal mucosa.456 Humans who lack the IL-12 receptor and therefore have impaired TH1 responses and interferon-\u03b3 production are at increased risk for Salmonella infection.457\n",

            "text": "Several major clinical syndromes occur with nontyphoidal Salmonella infection in young infants. Colonization without illness may be the most common outcome of ingestion of Salmonella by the neonate. Such colonization usually is detected when an outbreak is under investigation. Most infected infants who become ill have abrupt onset of loose, green, mucus-containing stools, or they have bloody diarrhea; an elevated temperature is also a common finding in Salmonella gastroenteritis in the first months of life.440 Grossly bloody stools are found in the minority of patients, although grossly bloody stools can occur in the first 24 hours of life. Hematochezia is more typically associated with noninfectious causes (e.g., swallowed maternal blood, intestinal ischemia, hemorrhagic diseases, anorectal fissures) at this early age.524 There appear to be major differences in presentation related to the serotype of S. enteritidis causing infection. For example, in one epidemic of S. oranienburg\n487 involving 46 newborns, 76% had grossly bloody stools, 11% were febrile, 26% had mucus in their stools, and only 11% were healthy. In a series of S. newport infections involving 11 premature infants,474 90% of infants with gastroenteritis had blood in their stools, 10% had fever, 10% had mucus in their stools, and 9% were asymptomatic. In an outbreak of S. typhimurium\n477 involving 11 ill and 5 healthy infants, none had bloody stools; all of the symptomatic infants were febrile and usually had loose, green stools. Of 26 infants infected by Salmonella virchow, 42% were asymptomatic; the rest had mild diarrhea.482 Seals and colleagues488 described 12 infants with S. nienstedten, all of whom had watery diarrhea and low-grade fever; none had bloody stools. In a large outbreak in Zimbabwe of S. heidelberg infection reported by Bannerman,485 38% of 100 infants were asymptomatic, 42% had diarrhea, 16% had fever, 15% had pneumonia, and 2% developed meningitis. An outbreak of Salmonella worthington was characterized primarily by diarrhea, fever, and jaundice, although 3 of 18 infants developed meningitis and 17% died.515 In dramatic contrast to these series, none of 27 infants with positive stool cultures for S. tennessee had an illness in a nursery found to be contaminated with that organism.469 A few infants with Salmonella gastroenteritis have developed necrotizing enterocolitis,492,\n525 but it is not clear whether Salmonella was the cause.",

Extraintestinal spread may develop in infants who initially present with diarrhea and in some who have no gastrointestinal tract signs. Bacteremia appears to be more common in the neonate than in the older child.530 A study of more than 800 children with Salmonella infection showed that extraintestinal infection occurred significantly more often (8.7% versus 3.6%) in the first 3 months of life.531 Several retrospective studies suggest that infants in the first month of life may have a risk of bacteremia as high as 30% to 50%.440 One retrospective study439 suggests that the risk is not increased in infancy and estimates that the risk of bacteremia in childhood Salmonella gastroenteritis is between 8.5% and 15.6%. Prospective studies of infants in the first year of life suggest that the risk of bacteremia is 1.8% to 6.0%.532,\n533 Although selection biases in these studies limit the reliability of these estimates, the risk is substantial. The Salmonella species isolated from infants include some serotypes that appear to be more invasive in the first 2 months of life than in older children or healthy adults (S. newport, S. agona, S. blockley, S. derby, S. enteritidis, S. heidelberg, S. infantis, S. javiana, S. saint-paul, and S. typhimurium) and serotypes that are aggressive in every age group (S. choleraesuis and S. dublin). Other serotypes appear more likely to cause bacteremia in adults (S. typhi, S. paratyphi A, and S. paratyphi B).530\n",

A few infants with Salmonella gastroenteritis have died with E. coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis,494 but the role of Salmonella in these cases is unclear. Unlike the situation in older children in whom bacteremic salmonellosis often is associated with underlying medical conditions, bacteremia may occur in infants who have no immunocompromising conditions.534\nSalmonella bacteremia is often not suspected clinically because the syndrome is not usually distinctive.439,\n440 Even afebrile, well-appearing children with Salmonella gastroenteritis have been documented to have bacteremia that persists for several days.535 Although infants with bacteremia may have spontaneous resolution without therapy,536 a sufficient number develop complications to warrant empirical antimicrobial therapy when bacteremia is suspected. The frequency of complications is highest in the first month of life. Meningitis is the most feared complication of bacteremic Salmonella disease. Between 50% and 75% of all cases of nontyphoidal Salmonella meningitis occur in the first 4 months of life.537 The serotypes associated with neonatal meningitis (S. typhimurium, S. heidelberg, S. enteritidis, S. saint-paul, S. newport, and S. panama)\n497 are serotypes frequently associated with bacteremia. Meningitis has a high mortality rate, in part because of the high relapse rates. Relapse has been reported in up to 64% of cases.538 In some studies, more than 90% of patients with meningitis have died,539 although more typically, 30% to 60% of infants die.540,\n541 The survivors suffer the expected complications of gram-negative neonatal meningitis, including hydrocephalus, seizures, ventriculitis, abscess formation, subdural empyema, and permanent neurologic impairment. Neurologic sequelae have included retardation, hemiparesis, epilepsy, visual impairment, and athetosis.537\n",

However, one of seven women with typhoid in a series still delivered a dead fetus with extensive liver necrosis.554 In the preantibiotic era, about 14% of pregnant women with typhoid fever died.555 With appropriate antimicrobial therapy, pregnancy does not appear to put the woman at increased risk of death.

            "text": "The current practice of early discharge of newborn infants, although potentially decreasing the risk of exposure, can make recognition of a nursery outbreak difficult. Diagnosis of neonatal salmonellosis should trigger an investigation for other cases. Other than diarrhea, signs of neonatal Salmonella infection are similar to the nonspecific findings seen in most neonatal infections. Lethargy, poor feeding, pallor, jaundice, apnea, respiratory distress, weight loss, and fever are common. Enlarged liver and spleen are common in those neonates with positive blood cultures. Laboratory studies are required to establish the diagnosis because the clinical picture is not distinct. The fecal leukocyte examination reveals polymorphonuclear leukocytes in 36% to 82%359,\n559 of persons with Salmonella infection, but it has not been evaluated in neonates. Obviously, the presence of fecal leukocytes is consistent with colitis of any cause and therefore is a nonspecific finding. Routine stool cultures usually detect Salmonella if two or three different enteric media (i.e., MacConkey\u2019s, eosin-methylene blue, Salmonella-Shigella, Tergitol 7, xylose-lysine-deoxycholate, brilliant green, or bismuth sulfite agar) are used. Stool, rather than rectal swab material, is preferable for culture, particularly if the aim of culture is to detect carriers.560 On the infrequent occasions when proctoscopy is performed, mucosal edema, hyperemia, friability, and hemorrhages may be seen.461 Infants who are bacteremic often do not appear sufficiently toxic to raise the suspicion of bacteremia.561 Blood cultures should be obtained as a routine part of evaluation of neonates with suspected or documented Salmonella infection. Ill neonates with Salmonella infection should have a cerebrospinal fluid examination performed. Bone marrow cultures also may be indicated when enteric fever is suspected. There are no consistent abnormalities in the white blood cell count. Serologic studies are not helpful in establishing the diagnosis, although antibodies to somatic562,\n563 and flagellar antigens487 develop in many infected newborns.",

Specific measures to eradicate Salmonella intestinal infection have met with little success. Multiple studies show that antibiotic treatment of Salmonella gastroenteritis prolongs the excretion of Salmonella.\n566,\n567,\n568,\n569,\n570,\n571,\n572,\n573 Almost one half of the infected children in the first 5 years of life continue to excrete Salmonella 12 weeks after the onset of infection; more than 5% have positive cultures at 1 year.574 No benefit of therapy has been shown in comparisons of ampicillin or neomycin versus placebo,570 chloramphenicol versus no antibiotic treatment,569 neomycin versus placebo,571 ampicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus no antibiotic,568 and ampicillin or amoxicillin versus placebo.572 In contrast to these studies, data suggest that there may be a role for quinolone antibiotics in adults and children,573,\n575 but these drugs are not approved for use in neonates, and resistance has been encountered.576 Because these studies have few data as to the risk-benefit ratio of therapy in the neonate, it is uncertain whether they should influence treatment decisions in neonates. Studies that have included a small number of neonates suggest little benefit from antimicrobial therapy.477,\n487,\n568,\n577,\n578 However, because bacteremia is common in neonates, antimicrobial therapy for infants younger than 3 months who have Salmonella gastroenteritis often is recommended,532,\n533,\n561 especially if the infant appears toxic. Premature infants and those who have other significant debilitating conditions also should probably be treated. The duration of therapy is debatable but should probably be no more than 3 to 5 days if the infant is not seriously ill and if blood cultures are sterile. If toxicity, clinical deterioration, or documented bacteremia complicates gastroenteritis, prolonged treatment is indicated. Even with antimicrobial therapy, some infants develop complications. The relatively low risk of extraintestinal dissemination must be balanced against the well-documented risk of prolonging the carrier state. For infants who develop chronic diarrhea and malnutrition, hyperalimentation may be required; the role of antimicrobial agents in this setting is unclear. The infant with typhoid fever should be treated with an antimicrobial agent; relapses sometimes occur after therapy.",

The aminoglycosides show good in vitro activity but poor clinical efficacy, perhaps because of the low pH of the phagolysosome. Aminoglycosides have poor activity in an acid environment. The stability of some drugs in this acid environment also may explain in vitro and in vivo disparities. The intracellular localization and survival of Salmonella within phagocytic cells also presumably explains the relapses encountered with virtually every regimen. Resistance to antibiotics has long been a problem with Salmonella infection.566,\n579,\n580 There has been a steady increase in resistance to Salmonella in the United States over the last 20 years.581 With the emergence of typhimurium type DT 104, resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline has increased from 0.6% in 1979 and 1980 to 34% in 1996.582 Resistance plasmids have been selected and transmitted, partly because therapy has been given for mild illness that should not have been treated566 and partly because of use of antibiotics in animal feeds. Resistance to chloramphenicol and ampicillin has made trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increasingly important for the treatment of Salmonella infection in those patients who require therapy. However, with increasing resistance to all three of these agents in Asia,583 the Middle East,584 Africa,585 Europe,586,\n587 Argentina,580 and North America,579,\n588,\n589 the third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones represent drugs of choice for invasive salmonellosis. The quinolones currently are not approved for persons younger than 18 years. Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone represent acceptable alternative drugs for typhoidal and nontyphoidal salmonellosis when resistance is encountered.590,\n591 Because the second-generation cephalosporins, such as cefuroxime, are less active in vitro than the third-generation cephalosporins and are not consistently clinically effective, they should not be used.590,\n592 Data suggest that cefoperazone may sterilize blood and cause patients with typhoid fever to become afebrile more rapidly than with chloramphenicol,593 perhaps because cefoperazone is excreted into bile in high concentrations.594 The third-generation cephalosporins may have higher cure and lower relapse rates than ampicillin or chloramphenicol in children with Salmonella meningitis.595 The doses of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, or cefotaxime used in infants with gastroenteritis pending results of blood cultures are the same as those used in treatment of sepsis. Because of the risk of gray baby syndrome, chloramphenicol should not be used in neonates unless other effective agents are not available. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, although useful in older children and adults, is not used in neonates because of the risk of kernicterus. Nosocomial infection with strains of Salmonella resistant to multiple antibiotics, including third-generation cephalosporins, has emerged as a problem in South America.580\n",

Shigellae are gram-negative bacilli that are unlike typical E. coli in that they do not metabolize lactose or do so slowly, are nonmotile, and generally produce no gas during carbohydrate use. They are classically divided into four species (serogroups) on the basis of metabolic and antigenic characteristics (Table 20\u20134). The mannitol nonfermenters usually are classified as S. dysenteriae. Although the lipopolysaccharide antigens of the 13 recognized members of this group are not related to each other antigenically, these serotypes are grouped together as serogroup A. Serogroup D (Shigella sonnei) are ornithine decarboxylase positive and slow lactose fermenters. All S. sonnei share the same lipopolysaccharide (O antigen). Those shigellae that ferment mannitol (unlike S. dysenteriae) but do not decarboxylate ornithine or ferment lactose (S. sonnei) belong to serogroups B and C. Of these, the strains that have lipopolysaccharide antigens immunologically related to each other are grouped together as serogroup B (Shigella flexneri), whereas those whose O antigens are not related to each other or to other shigellae are included in serogroup C (Shigella boydii). There are six major serotypes of S. flexneri and 13 subserotypes (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b, 6, X and Y variant). There are 19 antigenically distinct serotypes of S. boydii. For S. dysenteriae and S. boydii serogroup confirmation, pools of polyvalent antisera are used.\n",

In most of the developing world, the relative importance of these two species is reversed, and other Shigella serotypes, especially S. dysenteriae serotype 1, are identified more frequently. As hygiene improves, the proportion of S. sonnei increases and that of S. flexneri decreases.636 Data from Bangladesh suggest that S. dysenteriae is less common in neonates, but S. sonnei and S. boydii are more common.632\n",

Volunteer studies have shown that after ingestion, illness may be delayed for a week or more. Neonatal shigellosis seems to have a similar incubation period. More than one half of the neonatal cases occur within 3 days of birth, consistent with fecal-oral transmission during parturition. Mothers of infected neonates are sometimes carriers, although more typically they are symptomatic during the perinatal period. Intrauterine infection is rare. In the older child, the initial signs are usually high fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, toxicity, and large-volume watery stools; diarrhea may be bloody or may become bloody. Painful defecation and severe, crampy abdominal pain associated with frequent passage of small-volume stools with gross blood and mucus are characteristic findings in older children or adults who develop severe colitis. Many children, however, never develop bloody diarrhea. Adult volunteer studies have demonstrated that variations in presentation and course are not related to the dose ingested because some patients develop colitis with dysentery but others develop only watery diarrhea after ingestion of the same inoculum.623 The neonate with shigellosis may have a mild diarrheal syndrome or a severe colitis.633,\n637,\n638,\n639,\n640,\n641,\n642,\n643,\n644,\n645 Fever in neonates is usually low grade (<102\u00b0F) if the course is uncomplicated. The neonate has less bloody diarrhea, more dehydration, more bacteremia, and a greater likelihood of death than the older child.632 Physical examination of the neonate may show signs of toxicity and dehydration, although fever, abdominal tenderness, and rectal findings are less striking than in the older child.634\n",

Infants presenting with bloody diarrhea may have necrotizing enterocolitis or infection with Salmonella, EIEC, Yersinia enterocolitica, C. jejuni, or Entamoeba histolytica. Before cultures establish a diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data may aid in making a presumptive diagnosis. Abdominal radiographs demonstrating pneumatosis intestinalis suggest the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis.

Although debate continues over the indications for antimicrobial therapy in the patient with shigellosis, the benefits of therapy generally appear to outweigh the risks. The chief disadvantages of antimicrobial therapy include cost, drug toxicity, and emergence of antibiotic-resistant shigellae. Because of the self-limited nature of shigellosis, it has been argued that less severe illness should not be treated. However, children can feel quite ill during the typical bout of shigellosis, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy shortens the duration of illness and eliminates shigellae from stool, decreasing secondary spread. Complications are probably decreased by antibiotics. Given the high mortality rates of neonatal shigellosis, therapy should not be withheld.",

Although a sulfonamide is as efficacious as ampicillin when the infecting strain is susceptible,675 sulfonamides are avoided in neonates because of concern about the potential risk of kernicterus. The risk of empirical ampicillin therapy is that shigellae are frequently resistant to the drug; 50% of shigellae currently circulating in the United States are ampicillin resistant.696,\n697 For the neonate infected with ampicillin-resistant Shigella, there are few data on which to base a recommendation. Ceftriaxone is generally active against shigellae, but in the neonate, this drug can displace bilirubin-binding sites and elicit clinically significant cholestasis. Data on children and adults suggest that clinical improvement occurs with ceftriaxone.698,\n699 Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been shown to be effective agents for treating shigellosis700,\n701 in adults, but they are not approved for use in children younger than 18 years.

It infects sheep, cattle, goats, antelope, swine, chickens, domestic turkeys, and pet dogs. C. fetus often is carried asymptomatically in the intestinal or biliary tracts of sheep and cattle. During the course of a bacteremic illness in pregnant animals, C. fetus organisms, which have a high affinity for placental tissue, invade the uterus and multiply in the immunologically immature fetus. The infected fetuses generally are aborted. Whether this organism is acquired by humans from animals or is carried asymptomatically for long periods in humans, who may then transmit the organism through sexual contact as appears to occur in animals, is unclear. It is believed that this subspecies rarely is found in the human intestine and that it is not a cause of human enteritis.725\nC. fetus infections predominantly occur in older men with a history of farm or animal exposure and in pregnant women in their third trimester.710,\n711,\n716,\n717 Symptomatically or asymptomatically infected women may have recurrent abortions or premature deliveries and are the source of organisms associated with life-threatening perinatal infections of the fetus or newborn infant.710,\n739,\n740,\n741,\n742,\n743,\n744,\n745,\n746,\n747,\n748,\n830 In several instances of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, C. fetus was isolated from culture of maternal cervix or vagina.712,\n747,\n795 A nosocomial nursery outbreak has been associated with carriage in some healthy infants.831 Other outbreaks have been associated with meningitis 832,\n833 Cervical cultures have remained positive in women who have had recurrent abortions and whose husbands have antibody titer elevations.738\n",

In the case of C. fetus infecting the bloodstream or central nervous system, blood culture flasks should be blindly subcultured and held for at least 7 days or the organism may not be detected because of slow or inapparent growth.742 The diagnosis of C. fetus infection should be considered when there is an unexplained febrile illness in the third trimester of pregnancy or in the event of recurrent abortion, prematurity, or neonatal sepsis with or without meningitis.

It is a fastidious, microaerophilic, curved, motile gram-negative bacillus that has a single polar flagellum and is oxidase and catalase positive, except for C. upsaliensis, which is generally catalase negative or weakly positive. C. jejuni and C. fetus are separated by growth temperature (C. fetus grows best at 25\u00b0C but can be cultured at 37\u00b0C; C. jejuni grows best at 42\u00b0C) and by nalidixic acid and cephalosporin susceptibilities, because C. jejuni is susceptible to nalidixic acid and resistant to cephalosporins. C. jejuni grows best in a microaerobic environment of 5% oxygen and 10% carbon dioxide at 42\u00b0C. It grows on a variety of media, including Brucella and Mueller-Hinton agars, but optimal isolation requires the addition of selective and nutritional supplements. Growth at 42\u00b0 C in the presence of cephalosporins is used to culture selectively for C. jejuni from fecal specimens. In a study of six media, charcoal-based selective media and a modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar were the most selective for identification of Campylobacter species. Extending the incubation time from 48 to 72 hours led to an increase in the isolation rate regardless of the medium used.857 Its typical darting motility may provide a clue to identification, even in fresh fecal specimens, when viewed by phase-contrast microscopy.721,\n858\n",

In infants with C. jejuni gastroenteritis, limited data suggest that appropriate, early antimicrobial therapy results in improvement and rapid clearance of the organism from stool.845\nCampylobacter species are often resistant to \u03b2-lactams, including ampicillin and cephalosporins.860,\n861 Most strains are susceptible to erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and the newer quinolones, although resistance to these agents has been reported.862,\n863 It appears that a parenteral aminoglycoside is the drug of choice for C. fetus infections, pending in vitro susceptibility studies. In the case of central nervous system involvement, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol are potential alternative drugs. Depending on in vitro susceptibilities, which vary somewhat with locale, erythromycin is the drug of choice for treating C. jejuni enteritis.717,\n721,\n722 If erythromycin therapy is initiated within the first 4 days of illness, a reduction in excretion of the organism and resolution of symptoms occur.845 Although data regarding treatment of asymptomatic or convalescent carriers are not available, it seems appropriate to treat colonized pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy when there is a risk of perinatal or neonatal infection. The failure of prophylactic parenteral gentamicin in a premature infant has been documented, followed by successful resolution of symptoms and fecal shedding with erythromycin. Because there appears to be an increased risk of toxicity with erythromycin estolate during pregnancy and infancy,864 other forms of erythromycin should probably be used in these settings. Azithromycin appears to be effective if the organism is susceptible.865 Strains that are erythromycin resistant often are resistant to azithromycin.866\nCampylobacter tends to have higher minimal inhibitory concentrations for clarithromycin than for azithromycin.867 Furazolidone has been used in children and ciprofloxacin in nonpregnant patients older than 17 years.",

In late January of 1991, toxigenic V. cholerae O1, serotype Inaba, biotype El Tor, appeared in several coastal cities of Peru.907,\n908 It rapidly spread to most countries in South and North America. In reported cases, travel from the United States to Latin America or Asia and ingestion of contaminated food transported from Latin America or Asia have been incriminated. V. cholerae O139 (Bengal) arose on the Indian subcontinent as a new cause of epidemic cholera in 1993.910,\n911,\n912,\n913,\n914,\n915 It rapidly spread through Asia and continues to periodically reemerge as a cause of epidemic cholera. In the United States, an endemic focus of a unique strain of toxigenic V. cholerae O1 exists on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas.906,\n916 This strain is different from the one associated with the epidemic in South America. Most cases of disease associated with the strain endemic to the U.S. Gulf Coast have resulted from the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish. Humans are the only documented natural host, but free-living V. cholerae organisms can exist in the aquatic environment. The usual reported vehicles of transmission have included contaminated water or ice; contaminated food, particularly raw or undercooked shellfish; moist grains held at ambient temperature; and raw or partially dried fish. The usual mode of infection is ingestion of contaminated food or water. Boiling water or treating it with chlorine or iodine and adequate cooking of food kill the organism.907 Asymptomatic infection of family contacts is common but direct person-to-person transmission of disease has not been documented. Persons with low gastric acidity are at increased risk for cholera infection.",

Infection is often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic; cases of severe symptomatic infection during the immediate newborn period have not been reported. Symptoms in giardiasis are related to the age of the patient, with diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and failure to thrive typical in the youngest children. Seroprevalence studies have demonstrated evidence of past or current infection in 40% of Peruvian children by the age of 6 months.1081 In a study of lactating Bangladeshi mothers and their infants, 82% of women and 42% of infants excreted Giardia once during the study; in some infants, this occurred before they were 3 months old.1082 Of these infected infants, 86% had diarrhea, suggesting that the early exposure to the parasite resulted in disease. In a prospective study of diarrhea conducted in Mexico, infants frequently were infected with Giardia from birth to 2 months, with a crude incidence rate of first Giardia infection of 1.4 infections per child-year in this age group.6 The symptom status of these children was not reported but this study strongly suggests that G. lamblia may be more common than currently recognized among newborns living in developing areas.",

The gross appearance of the bowel is usually normal; however, under the dissecting microscope, scattered focal lesions of the mucosal surface are apparent in most cases. Light microscopy also shows patchy changes in villous morphology, compatible with a process of infection, inflammation, and accelerated mucosal renewal. The villi take on a shortened and blunt appearance as tall columnar cells are shed and replaced by less mature cuboidal enterocytes.1133,\n1135,\n1144 Ischemia may also play a role in the loss and stunting of villi1145 and activation of the enteric nervous system; active secretion of fluid and electrolytes may be another pathogenic mechanism.1146 During the recovery phase, the enteroblastic cells mature and reconstruct the villous structure. Because of the loss of mature enterocytes on the tips of the villi, the surface area of the intestine is reduced. Diarrhea that occurs may be a result of this decrease in surface area, disruption in epithelial integrity, transient disaccharidase deficiency, or altered countercurrent mechanisms and net secretion of water and electrolytes.1133,\n1140,\n1142,\n1146,\n1147,\n1148 NSP4 has been found to induce age-dependent diarrhea in CD1 mice by triggering calcium-dependent chloride and water secretion.1149 The potential role of this \u201cviral enterotoxin\u201d in human disease is not yet clear.1150,\n1151\n",

There are numerous reports of nosocomial and daycare center rotavirus gastroenteritis outbreaks that attest to the ease with which this agent spreads through a hospital or institutional setting.1108 Admission of a symptomatic child usually is the initiating event, although transfer of a neonate with inapparent infection from one ward to another also has been incriminated. The most important factors influencing the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea in a nursery are the proximity to other newborns and the frequency of handling.1187 During a 4-month study, infants cared for by nursing staff and kept in communal nurseries experienced three epidemics of diarrhea with attack rates between 20% and 50%. During the same period, only 2% of infants rooming in with their mothers became ill, even though they had frequent contact with adult relatives and siblings.",

Because rotavirus is often excreted several days before illness is recognized, isolation of an infant with diarrhea may be too late to prevent cross-infection unless all nursing personnel and medical staff have adhered to this fundamental precaution. Infants who develop gastroenteritis should be moved out of the nursery area if adequate facilities are available and the infant\u2019s condition permits transfer. The use of an incubator is of value in reducing transmission of disease only by serving as a reminder that proper hand-hygiene and glove techniques are required, but is of little value as a physical barrier to the spread of virus.1187 Encouraging rooming-in of infants with their mothers has been shown to be helpful in preventing or containing nursery epidemics.1243 Temporary closure of the nursery may be required for clinically significant outbreaks that cannot be controlled with other measures.1128\n",

After approximately 500,000 children were vaccinated with more than 1 million doses, a significantly increased risk of intussusception was observed among vaccinated children, with an overall odds ratio of 1.8.1244 Use of this vaccine was terminated. Two new vaccine candidates are undergoing phase III clinical trials: a \u201cpentavalent\u201d bovine-human reassortant vaccine including G types G1-G4 and P type P1A[8] and a monovalent human attenuated P1A[8]G1 vaccine. The epidemiology of rotavirus infection will change significantly if one or both candidates become widely available in the future. The impact on neonatal infection will depend on the effect of herd immunity in decreasing circulation of rotavirus strains.",

The most common initiating factor is a primary infection of the gastrointestinal tract that is mild to moderate in severity, self-limited, and responsive to supportive measures. Acute diarrhea can also be an initial manifestation of a systemic infection, including bacterial and viral neonatal sepsis. Infants with moderate to severe diarrhea require close monitoring until the etiologic diagnosis and the clinical evolution are clarified. There are noninfectious diseases leading to chronic intractable diarrhea that may result in severe nutritional disturbances or even death unless the specific underlying condition is identified and treated appropriately. The differential diagnosis of a diarrheal illness requires a careful clinical examination to determine whether the child has a localized or a systemic process. Lethargy, abnormalities in body temperature, hypothermia or hyperthermia, decreased feeding, abdominal distention, vomiting, pallor, respiratory distress, apnea, cyanosis, hemodynamic instability, hypotension, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, coagulation or bleeding disorders, petechiae, and exanthemas should lead to an intense laboratory investigation directed at systemic viral or bacterial infection. If the process is deemed a localized intestinal infection, initial evaluation can be focused on differentiating an inflammatory-invasive pathogen from those that cause a noninflammatory process. For this, stool examination for fecal leukocytes, red blood cells, and lactoferrin can be a helpful indicator of the former.\n",
