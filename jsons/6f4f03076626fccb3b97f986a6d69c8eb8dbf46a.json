Consult specialists on infectious diseases or respiratory physicians from designated medical institutions to confirm COVID-19 as soon as possible. Chest CT and novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection should be performed immediately for suspected cases. b. If COVID-19 can be excluded by the infectious disease specialist according to chest CT, it is recommended to choose a treatment strategy according to the risk stratification of NSTE-ACS: intervention or medication. iii. If COVID-19 cannot be excluded by chest CT, routine medical treatment of NSTEMI should be given and risk stratification Cardiopulse should be conducted while waiting for the results of nucleic acid detection. For patients with low or middle risk, routine medical therapy including oxygen inhalation, coronary artery dilatation, and antithrombotic treatment should be given in the emergency room. Blood oxygen saturation and other clinical data should be monitored closely for the prevention of malignant arrhythmia. For patients with high or extremely high risk, especially those with haemodynamic instability and strong indications for immediate interventional treatment, the high-level infection control panel should be started, and two or more specialists should codetermine the risk of COVID-19. If the risk of COVID-19 is con-sidered high, patients should be transferred to the local designated medical institution for interventional treatment and enhanced supportive treatment. iv. While waiting for the confirmation of COVID-19, efforts should be made to identify the patient's aetiology. If viral infection was an contributing factor or cause of myocardial injury, type 2 myocardial infarction should be diagnosed. The treatment strategy of type 2 myocardial infarction should be mainly based on the primary diseases. Therefore, CT coronary artery scan should be completed at the same time as chest CT examination for better determination of treatment strategy.
