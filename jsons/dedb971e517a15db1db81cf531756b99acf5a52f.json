Furthermore, several groups of people, such as the elderly and those with some pre-existing medical conditions, appear to be particularly vulnerable to the disease [1, 2] .",

A lack of specific resources-such as a lack of beds in Intensive Care Units, essential medicines and ventilators-and increased demand on the NHS may mean that front-line workers, such as clinicians, paramedics and other care staff, may be unable to provide adequate treatment to all patients, as seen in Italy [3] . Additionally, current guidance recommends that anyone who is showing signs of a potential COVID-19 infection (e.g. new persistent cough, fever), or who lives in a house with someone who shows such signs, must self-quarantine at home [2] meaning that some clinicians will be unable to return to their 'front-line' responsibilities at a time when their colleagues are working exceptionally hard. As a result of these exceptional challenges, lives will inevitably be lost that could, in other circumstances, have been saved. Non-clinical professionals in other essential roles, such as the justice system, media workers, social workers, etc., may also feel the profound effects of being required to perform already highly challenging duties in a more constrained manner which may lead to risks being more difficult to manage. How such events will impact front-line, key worker teams remains unclear, but it is likely that many will experience a degree of moral distress and some moral injuries [4] .",

Morally injurious events can include acts of perpetration, acts of omission or experiences of betrayal from leaders or trusted others. Unlike post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), moral injury is not a mental illness. Although experiences of potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) can lead to negative thoughts about oneself or others (e.g. \"I am a monster\" or \"my colleagues don't care about me\") as well as deep feelings of shame, guilt or disgust. These, in turn, can contribute to the development of mental health problems, including depression, PTSD and anxiety [6] .",

Discussing this topic in advance of exposure to a PMIE, most probably facilitated by supervisory level leaders, may help develop psychological preparedness and allow staff to understand some inevitable symptoms of distress. 2. Front-line staff should be encouraged to seek informal support, from trained peer supporters, managers, colleagues, chaplains or other welfare provision provided by their employer, early on and take a 'nip it in the bud' approach-rather than dwelling on the PMIEs they have been exposed to. There is good evidence that social support is generally protective for mental health. 3. If informal support does not help, professional help should be sought early on. Professional support is likely to be needed when difficulties relating to the PMIE become persistent and impair an individual's daily functioning. Sources of confidential help, which should be rapidly accessible, should be well advertised within organizations. Those providing such support should be aware of the concept of moral injury and also that those suffering with such difficulties may often fail to talk about them because of intense feelings of shame and guilt. 4. Those in leadership roles should be encouraged to proactively 'check in' with their teams, offer empathetic support and encourage help-seeking where necessary. It is vital that managers feel comfortable in having psychologically informed conversations with their staff, or if they do not possess such skills, they should ensure that someone else (e.g. trained peer supporter) checks in with their staff on a regular basis instead. 5 . Employers of essential staff should be aware that psychological debriefing techniques and psychological screening approaches are ineffective. Instead, it is imperative that organizations actively monitor staff exposed to PMIEs, facilitate effective team cohesion and make informal, as well as professional, sources of support readily available to their employees. Furthermore, exposure to PMIEs should be frankly discussed and efforts should be made to ensure that staff understand the potential for their work during the COVID-19 outbreak to impact on their mental health, whilst ensuring they are also aware that psychological growth can also be expected if staff 'do their best'.",
