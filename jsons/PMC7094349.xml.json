            "text": "Antibody phage display is an in vitro screening technique that allows for rapid selection of multiple monoclonal antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Hoogenboom, 2005). It involves the display of a polyclonal collection of antibody fragments containing the variable regions, numbering up to 1011 different clones, on the surface of filamentous phage carrying the genetic sequence of the displayed fragment. Antibody library repertoires can be obtained primarily by two methods, either from cDNA antibody sequences derived from the B cells of immunized or non-immune animal or human donors, or synthetically generated using random nucleotide sequences within selected CDRs (complementarity-determining regions) in combination with one or multiple framework regions to replicate the diversity of a natural antibody repertoire (Conrad and Scheller, 2005). These sequences are then fused to the sequence encoding the gene III (gIII) coat protein of the phage, enabling expression and incorporation of the antibody fragment on its surface. This collection of phage-displayed antibodies is then panned repeatedly against the antigen of interest, producing a polyclonal phage collection enriched for antigen-specific antibodies, from which individual monoclonal clones can then be identified and characterized.",

Therefore for functional use as an antibody, the clone must be transferred to an appropriate vector for expression of recombinant full-length immunoglobulin in eukaryotic cell culture (Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Jostock et al., 2004). However, some antibody clones may fail to express properly or lose affinity during this conversion from a bacterial to a eukaryotic expression system, as well as a change of antibody structural format. This may be caused by the presence of amber stops within coding sequences generated from random synthetic nucleotide sequences (Marcus et al., 2006), or improper folding. This is a particular problem for synthetic libraries as they have not undergone positive selection within the immune system to remove antibodies that are unable to express or fold properly, unlike libraries generated from natural repertoires. On the other hand, synthetic libraries may have advantages over natural ones in that they possess non-natural sequences that may code for antibodies with unusual specificities that are not present in natural repertoires (Griffiths et al., 1994).",

            "text": "Poor conversion of the isolated antibody fragment-phage clones to a soluble antibody format impairs the suitability of phage display as a method for the rapid generation of antibodies. Therefore, in this study, we compared the relative ability of a semi-synthetic scFv library and a natural non-immune Fab library to generate useful diagnostic antibodies that can be converted and expressed as soluble recombinant antibodies to be used as a detection reagent. Our choice of antigens was two commonly cited bioterrorism threats, epsilon toxin (Etox) and protective antigen (PA). While screening of the scFv library produced multiple clones that bound as phage, only a small percentage of clones were successfully expressed as either soluble scFv or full-length IgG and retained specificity and functionality. On the other hand, screening of the Fab library produced multiple high affinity clones against Etox and PA, all of which functioned as soluble Fab. Upon conversion to full-length IgG, they were capable of sub-microgram levels of detection in a sandwich ELISA. Many of the synthetic scFv clones were found to contain amber stops in their CDRs or N-linked glycosylation sites. However, removal of these sequences did not render the majority of these clones amenable to expression as soluble recombinant antibody, suggesting that improper folding may also be a factor. The results of the study suggest that non-immune naturally derived antibody libraries may be preferable to synthetic scFv libraries for rapid isolation of antibodies against typical foreign or pathogenic protein antigens.",

Each scFv monomer is connected to the dimerization motif via the flexible hinge of murine IgG3. Due to the presence of amber stop codons within the antibody CDRs which would prevent expression of the scFv in non-suppressor E. coli strains, overlapping PCR was carried out to introduce a single point mutation to convert the TAG stop codon to GAG, hence retaining the correct amino acid sequence. The sequence was then cloned into the expression vector via NcoI and NotI. Expression of scFv dimers was performed in the non-suppressor E. coli strain HB2151. Inoculated cultures were induced with 0.2 mM IPTG at late log growth phase (OD600 0.8) and then grown overnight at room temperature.

While other stop codons would result in the non-expression of the antibody-gIII fusion protein, in the TG1 E. coli strain the amber stop codon TAG is translated as glutamic acid due to the presence of an amber suppressor tRNA gene (SupE) (Weigert et al., 1965). In addition, several scFv clones (I70, 74, J3 and J49) were also found to have predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (N - X - S / T) (Kaplan et al., 1987) within their heavy and light CDRs (Fig. 1C).

Three antibodies were found to express poorly with undetectable yield on purification of culture media (I41, I74 and J50). Of the antibodies that were successfully expressed, three (I70, J89 and J96) had no binding ability, while the remaining four (I20, I64, J3, and J49) retained affinity and specificity, in correlation to the results of the scFv ELISA (Fig. 1F). I64, although initially considered cross-reactive as scFv also had a slight PA-specific signal above background and could be considered a weak binder. On the other hand, the loss of binding of I70 could be attributed to an N-linked glycosylation site on the light chain CDR3, which produced a noticeable shift in mass as observed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1G). Glycosylation on the CDR region, which contacts the antigen, is highly likely to interfere with antigen binding. However, glycosylation was also observed in clones that retained binding activity, such as in the light chains of J3 and the light and heavy chains of J49. As these particular chains were observed to have doublet bands on SDS-PAGE, it could be that these two clones undergo incomplete glycosylation, resulting in a portion of expressed antibody retaining binding activity. It is unclear why some clones were unable to express as IgG, but glycosylation was probably not the only determining factor, as only one (I74) out of the three poorly expressing antibodies (I41, I74 and J50) contained a predicted glycosylation site.",

This suggested less efficient enrichment compared to the screening against PA and may explain the lower percentage of positive clones (8%). Due to the low number of positive Etox clones (OD > 0.5), additional weaker binders were also selected for further analysis and a total of nine unique clones isolated and sequenced (Fig. 2B). Unfortunately, similar to what was observed earlier, six clones were found to contain amber stops, while two others contained predicted glycosylation sites (Fig. 2C). In view of our previous findings that the presence of amber stops and glycosylation sites could have led to a loss of antibody functionality, we decided not to pursue the conversion of these scFv Etox clones to soluble antibody formats and proceed to the panning with the Humanyx Fab library.",

To determine whether the antibodies isolated from the scFv and Fab libraries can be used as detection reagents, we evaluated the performance of a panel of library-derived antibodies as capture-detector pairs in a sandwich ELISA. Each antibody was used both as capture and detector for all possible pairings. The choice of capture and detector antibodies is key to achieving high sensitivity in sandwich ELISAs, as pairs that have overlapping binding sites will compete with one another for antigen binding and hence perform poorly in the assay. Therefore, antibody libraries which can produce a large number of unique high affinity clones are advantageous, for they are more likely to generate antibody pairs that target different antigenic sites on the target molecule. As an additional comparison, I20, the best performing PA antibody that remained functional as a soluble scFv and IgG was also included. For the study with antibodies derived from the Fab library screening, purified IgG was used as capture and the biotinylated version was used as detector. In the PA IgG vs IgG-bio sandwich ELISA, clones PA21 and PA29 performed the best as detectors, while clones PA53 and PA64 were identified as the best capture antibodies (Fig. 4A). In contrast, I20, while specific gave very low signals when used as capture antibody, and did not bind antigen when biotinylated as a detector antibody. As biotinylation seemed to diminish the binding of the scFv library-derived I20 antibody, for all anti-PA IgGs derived from the scFv library that retained functionality (I20, mI64, mJ3 and mJ49), directly HRP conjugated antibodies were used for detection. Both I20 and mI64 were found to work well as either capture or detector while mJ3 was found to be a suitable detector antibody (Fig. 4B).",

While this may be attributed to the use of random base insertion during the construction of the semi-synthetic library, the percentage of clones containing the amber stop codon appears disproportionally high. The exact reason for this observation is unclear. However, it has been shown that when using suppressor strains such as TG1, the presence of amber stop codons reduces expression (Oh et al., 2007). If expression of the antibody-gIII fusion protein is toxic to the bacteria, selection for clones with reduced expression of this protein may occur, increasing the likelihood for the selection of clones with amber stop codon as opposed to those with the corresponding classical glutamic acid codon.",

On the other hand, this problem is not found in libraries using naturally derived sequences, as any antibody sequences that could not be properly expressed would have been eliminated from the natural immune repertoire during positive selection. The presence of N-linked glycosylation sites on CDRs on the other hand, was also shown to affect functionality in mammalian-expressed IgG in this study.

Out of twelve unique scFv clones, five could be expressed as functional soluble scFv; and only three of these along with one other weakly binding scFv could be converted into functional recombinant full-length IgG. In contrast, all isolated clones from the Humanyx Fab library worked as soluble Fab and could be expressed as functional IgG upon conversion. The non-natural structure of scFv may have allowed for some synthetic scFv sequences to fold in a way that allowed specific binding when expressed on phage but not when expressed as soluble antibody. Whereas, the screening for specific monoclonal Fab was performed using soluble Fab, therefore improperly folded antibodies would have been automatically eliminated. Furthermore, natural antibodies from the Fab library, unlike synthetic antibodies, are already pre-selected for proper folding and binding activity due to positive selection in the immune system, thus are unlikely to fold improperly when expressed as Fab and possibly even if expressed as scFv.",

Given that hybridoma-derived monoclonals have been affinity matured, the remarkable ability of our isolated pairs to achieve a 5\u201325 ng/ml limit of detection highlights the potential of the phage screening process for generating specific and high affinity antibodies rapidly. While our screening of anti-PA IgGs from the scFv library also identified functional pairs, these had a marginally poorer limit of detection at 300 ng/ml to 1 \u03bcg/ml. More importantly, these functional pairs required IgGs that had to be modified to remove their amber stop codons, thus reducing their suitability for rapid development into diagnostic reagents. These pairs also used an IgG that have a significant percentage of polypeptide chains bearing unnatural glycosylations within the CDRs (mJ3), which may render a portion of antibody molecules defective and reduce the functionality of the antibody.",
