We agree and that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not increase angiotensin II, while angiotensin-receptor blockers have the potential to increase it. However, the hypothesis that the interaction of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) with angiotensin II could lead to a conformational change in the receptor binding domain of ACE2 is not unfounded and has been put forth in the study on the X-Ray structure of ACE-2 [2]. With regards to other query about the purported protection of lung injury by the renin angiotensin system blockers(RASBs), we humbly inform that it has already been dealt with a great detail, which authors seems to have overlooked. Similarly, the figures in our article has much more detailed information on the interaction of renin angiotensin system blockers (RASB), ACE-2 and coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19).",
