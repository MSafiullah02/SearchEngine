Vaccination remains a cornerstone in the prevention of infection. However, vaccine efficacy can vary from 50 to 80% in a healthy population1 and is significantly decreased in groups such as the immune compromised,2 very young children and the elderly.1 Thus, while much of the focus is on prevention, there are significant populations that remain at risk of infection. With the recent emergence of more pathogenic strains such as the 2009 and 2014 H1N1, infection can have more devastating consequences. During the 2013\u20132014 influenza season alone, it was reported that a very high number of young, otherwise healthy individuals required critical care in the intensive care unit, with a high percentage (72%) of these patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure requiring ventilator therapy.3 The current course of treatment for these patients consists of anti-viral therapies (Oseltamvir or Zanamivir), which are most effective when given within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. This is often well outside the window in which individuals seek medical attention. Given the tremendous inflammation and injury that occurs in the lung after influenza infection, effective therapeutic regimens should be focused on reducing viral burden, while decreasing inflammation and at the same time promoting lung/epithelial repair.",

It is important to understand that cytokines play critical roles in both regulating protective and reparative processes as well as causing injury. Interleukin- 22 (IL-22) has great potential in reducing pulmonary injury and promoting epithelial repair. Its limited receptor distribution allows IL-22 to have a focused effect on the epithelium. Through the IL-22Ra1/IL-10Rb receptor complex, IL-22 activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the lung epithelium, thereby augmenting barrier function, epithelial repair, and the induction of anti-microbial genes.4 Our lab5 and others6\u20138 have shown that IL-22 is important for recovery during influenza infection, as Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice have more severe injury. Moreover, we showed IL-22 receptor distribution in the lung and its importance in reducing lung pathology in both the airways and lung parenchyma after influenza challenge. We also found that Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with H1N1 PR/834 have enhanced structural lung pathology, defective expression of genes that control epithelial repopulation, and increased evidence of fibrosis.5",

            "text": "Generally, IL-22 is not found in the naive lung and is produced by activated T cells following infection. In the case of influenza, IL-22 is produced by both natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells.7,9 Once it is produced, it can be post-translationally regulated through interactions with IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP). This soluble receptor is a naturally occurring antagonist that has a 20\u20131000-fold higher affinity for IL-22 than the membrane-bound IL-22Ra1.10\u201312 IL-22BP binds IL-22 at a site that is directly adjacent to and interferes with the binding of both its membrane-bound receptors, IL-22Ra1 and IL-10Rb.11 When bound to IL-22BP, IL-22 is unable to signal through STAT3.10\u201312 There are currently three isoforms that have been identified in humans.9 Isoform 1 is retained intracellularly and does not bind IL-22. Human isoform 1 has been found to interact with components of the unfolded protein response.13 Human isoform 2 is most closely related to the single murine isoform of IL-22BP and is induced under inflammatory conditions. Human isoform three binds IL-22 with less affinity than human isoform two and is present at high levels during homeostatic conditions.10 In the intestine, IL-22BP is made by dendritic cells14,15 and is regulated by the inflammasome.15 Neutralizing IL-22BP in the lung significantly increases survival and decreases neutrophilia in a mouse model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.16 Under naive conditions in the lung, alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages (AMs) have been identified as sources of IL-22BP,17,18 and neutrophils are a source during catastrophic lung injury.18",

We demonstrate that NK and CD45\u2212 cells and macrophages are main cellular sources of IL-22BP under naive conditions. However, following influenza infection, these cellular sources decrease production, whereas production by dendritic cells is upregulated. Using Il22ra2\u2212/\u2212 mice we demonstrate that a pro-IL-22 environment significantly reduces pulmonary inflammation and vascular leak into the lung as well as lung pathology. We further reveal that this reduction in lung leak may be due to increases in tight junctions (CLDN4, TJP1, and TJP2), which was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, we demonstrate that the therapeutic nature of IL-22 as oropharyngeal administration of IL-22:Fc during infection improved the epithelial barrier and reduced inflammation.",

There were no differences in the BAL of mock-infected WT and Il22ra2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3a, b) with >98% of the cells being macrophages (data not shown).

These data corresponded with decreased cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-17, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) (Fig. 3f).

To test the impact of IL-22 administration, we used a human recombinant (r)IL-22:Fc,25 which is capable of signaling on mouse cells (Fig. 6a). Mice were treated with IL-22:Fc or Fc control 6 days after infection, when the expression of Il22ra2 significantly wanes (Fig. 1b). Measurement of vascular leak into the lung revealed a significant decrease 24 hours after IL-22:Fc treatment (Fig. 6b). To confirm these results were not due to off-target effects of the human IL-22 or the Fc, we performed experiments in mice lacking the IL-22 receptor. Il22ra1\u2212/\u2212 mice19,26 were crossed with eIIa-cre+/+ (eIIacre) mice. This cre is expressed in the early mouse embryo and thus causes recombination and excision of Il22ra1 globally. eIIacre \u00d7 Il22ra1fl/fl or eIIacre controls were infected and treated at days 6 and 8 after infection. Although not significant, IL-22R-competent mice, but not IL-22R-deficient mice, recover weight after IL-22 treatment. Moreover, results showed that IL-22:Fc treatment significantly reduced the influx of inflammatory cells in the BAL of eIIacre mice, but not the mice lacking the IL-22 receptor (eIIacre+/+ \u00d7 Il22ra1fl/fl) (Fig. 6d) or in control-treated mice. These data demonstrate that IL-22 signaling through the IL-22 receptor can significantly restore lung tight junctions and reduce inflammation.",

Despite great efforts in advancing vaccination strategies, there is little understanding of how to treat severe influenza-induced pneumonia in cases where vaccination is ineffective. To develop treatment options for severe influenza, it is vital to understand the immune processes that occur during infection. Here we show the importance of the IL-22/IL-22BP axis in influenza infection. We show that during influenza infection there is a change in the balance of IL-22/IL-22BP with IL-22 increasing at the same time Il22ra2 expression is being reduced. We also identified multiple sources for IL-22BP in the lung with the most predominant being CD45\u2212 cells. Next, using Il22ra2\u2212/\u2212 mice we demonstrate that a pro-IL-22 signaling environment reduces pulmonary inflammation and vascular leak into the lung as well as lung pathology. The reduced leak into the lung is due to increases in tight junction proteins as we found significant increases in claudin-4 as well as zo-1 and zo-2 both in vivo and in vitro. More importantly, we demonstrate that the therapeutic nature of IL-22 as oropharyngeal administration of IL-22:Fc during infection improved the epithelial barrier and reduced inflammation.",

This is likely due in part to limited expression of the IL-22 receptor5 and constitutive production of IL-22BP.8,10 Our data demonstrate that Il22ra2 is present during naive conditions, regulating the activity of IL-22. It is produced, mainly, by non-inflammatory (CD45\u2212) cells as well as NK cells and macrophages. After infection, Il22ra2 transcription is significantly decreased in most of its cellular sources. Our data is similar to the findings of Ivanov et al.,8 as expression of Il22 increase in response to influenza infection, there is a reduction of Il22ra2. This is during the same time that the IL-22Ra1 is increased on epithelial cells.5,28 These changes allow the lung to become a more permissive environment for IL-22 activity. This has been confirmed by microarray studies in which only 431 genes were differentially regulated after IL-22 treatment in naive mice as opposed to 1231 genes after IL-22 treatment in influenza-infected mice.22",

Furthermore, targeting this axis has also proven useful in lung bacterial infections4,19 and fungal infections,46 as well as bacterial co-infections.8,22 The question remains though\u2014If IL-22 is so important in resolving infection, why is it so tightly controlled and is it safe to target? The answers to this can be found at other epithelial surfaces. In the skin, overabundance of IL-22 is associated with increased inflammation and psoriasis [for a review see ref. 47] and reduced expression of IL-22BP only exacerbates this process.48,49 In the intestine, where IL-22 is constitutively expressed to protect the mucosal surface,50\nIl22ra2\u2212/\u2212 mice develop greater number of tumors in a colitis cancer model.15 Therefore, too much IL-22 can have negative consequences. This does not preclude the positive, potentially therapeutic data we present here. Our studies examine very acute responses to IL-22/IL-22BP imbalance and therefore not likely to induce pathology that is seen in diseases of chronic IL-22/IL-22BP imbalance.",

While knocking out Il22ra2 has a profound benefit on recovery during influenza infection, there are currently not any known therapeutic approaches designed to do this. Administration of IL-22:Fc may prove to be more beneficial.
