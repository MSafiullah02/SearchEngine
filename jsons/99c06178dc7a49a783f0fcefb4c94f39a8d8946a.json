[5] [6] [7] Therefore, the optimal treatment regimen for the management of moderate and severe bronchiolitis (SB) remains unclear. In recent years, heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) therapy has been introduced as a novel alternative method for the management of acute respiratory distress due to bronchiolitis. 8 HHHFNC can be set up easily, is safe, and well-known as a noninvasive respiratory support therapy method used in the case of respiratory distress. 9 It delivers heated and humidified high flow oxygen and does not irritate the respiratory mucosa. 10 HHHFNC is also able to generate a positive-end expiratory pressure without valve system (fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) can be varied between 21% and 100%). 11 Evidence also indicates that HHHFNC exerts beneficial effects by reducing inspiratory resistance, washing out of the nasopharyngeal anatomical dead space, reducing metabolic work related to gas conditioning, and finally improving the airway conductance and mucociliary clearance. 10 Thus, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is excreted and ventilation-perfusion balance is supported. 12, 13 HHHFNC therapy has been shown to be more efficient than standard care and to reduce the rate of intubation/invasive ventilation in the management of acute SB. [14] [15] [16] Despite these beneficial effects of HHHFNC, it has not been recommended by international guidelines. Nevertheless, the data are still limited on using this modality in ED setting. 17 In young children, few clinical studies compare the effects of various HHHFNC flow rates, and almost all of them were conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU). 18, 19 The optimal flow rate is still unknown. Physicians mostly select HHHFNC flow rates empirically without consideration of a patient\u02bcs weight and age. There is no study comparing flow rates on bronchiolitis 2 L\u00b7kg\u00b7min \u22121 with 1 L\u00b7kg\u00b7min \u22121 in the ED setting. Therefore, we performed a prospective clinical study to compare the HHHFNC flow rate of 1-L\u00b7kg\u00b7min \u22121 with 2-L\u00b7kg\u00b7min \u22121 in patients with SB admitted to our ED. The cannula size was selected as not to be wider than half the diameter of the patient\u02bcs nares. Sedation was achieved by oral feeding for the majority of patients (breastfeeding was preferred if possible), but if necessary, sedative drugs such as dexmedetomidine or midazolam were administered.

However, some questions such as \"which dose should be preferred for infants with bronchiolitis?\" about this respiratory support modality still have not found an answer. 18 Although previously the 1-L\u00b7kg\u00b7min \u22121 flow rate or 4 to 8 L/min flow rate was frequently used in patients with bronchiolitis, currently most centers choose the 2-L\u00b7kg\u00b7min \u22121 flow rate. 14, 16, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] But this modification is based on only a few physiological studies, and there still has been no satisfactory clinical data to determine the optimal flow rate required for clinical benefit. [28] [29] [30] According to the physiological studies, a flow rate \u22652-L\u00b7kg\u00b7min \u22121 is required to achieve a clinically adequate pharyngeal pressure, with improved breathing pattern and reduced respiratory muscles workload, in patients with bronchiolitis. 29, 30 Contrary to these studies, Milesi et al 19 published a randomized, prospective, and multicenter comparison study of two HHHFNC flow rates, and they indicate that 3 L\u00b7kg\u00b7min \u22121 was not superior to 2 L\u00b7kg\u00b7min \u22121 when used for the primary management of moderate or SB. Moreover, the 3 L\u00b7kg\u00b7min \u22121 flow rate was associated with a higher rate of discomfort and with a longer stay in the ICU. Similarly, our findings also supported these results and showed that using the increased flow rate in children with SB was not associated with treatment success. Although increasing the flow rate might generate more effective positive airway pressure, this hypothesis seemed realistic physiologically but not clinically. Also, it may be that the higher expiratory resistance imposed by a higher flow-rate offsets any benefit of improving mean airway pressure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 305, "end": 307, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 493, "end": 496, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 497, "end": 500, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 501, "end": 505, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 506, "end": 510, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 511, "end": 515, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 516, "end": 520, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 521, "end": 525, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 526, "end": 530, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 531, "end": 535, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 725, "end": 729, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 730, "end": 734, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 735, "end": 739, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 979, "end": 982, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 983, "end": 985, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1028, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "One of the most important goals of using HHHFNC in patients with respiratory distress in the ED is an early response.
