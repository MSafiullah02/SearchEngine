Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor that engages the Spike surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-26\n,\n7. ACE2 is highly expressed in many organs, including the lung, heart, kidney, and intestine. Notably, in experimental models of SARS-CoV infection, Spike protein engagement decreases ACE2 expression and activates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)6. RAS activation promotes platelet adhesion and aggregation, and increases the risk for pulmonary embolism, hypertension and fibrosis8, 9, 10, 11. It also accelerates cardiac and kidney injury by increasing local angiotensin II concentrations12, 13, 14. Apart from affecting the classic RAS pathway, ACE2 deficiency in the intestine is associated with malnutrition and colonic inflammation15.",

Many features have also been reported for COVID-19, such as prolonged coagulation profiles, elevated concentrations of D-dimers, severe lymphopenia, ARDS, hypertension, and acute heart injury in ICU-admitted patients2\n,\n19. Given that angiotensin II concentrations were highly elevated in the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients20, RAS was likely a major pathogenic contributor of disease progression. Indeed, in a recent study describing 1099 patients with COVID-19, the concentrations of D-dimers were elevated in 40% and 60% of the non-severe and severe cases at hospital admission21, respectively. Furthermore, Zhou et al.22 showed that a concentration of D-dimer greater than 1 mg/L on admission was associated with significantly increased risk of mortality for patients with COVID-19. Thus, prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy should be considered for alleviating the multi-organ damage for patients with COVID-19.",

DIP (50 mg oral TID) has been used in patients to prevent hypercoagulability39, and the serum drug concentration was reported to be around 3 \u03bcmol/L40.

Additionally, his oxygen saturation remained low throughout. In contrast, the other severely ill patient who also had very low oxygen saturation and high D-dimer concentration (8.83 mg/L) at administration had been in clinically remission by the time of manuscript submission. His D-dimer concentration initially increased as high as 15.72 mg/L two days after DIP treatment, but has gradually declined to 2.79 mg/L 4\u20135 days after DIP adjunctive therapy. This reinforces that high concentrations of D-dimer and low lymphocyte counts are associated with poor prognosis and suggest that DIP treatment should be initiated before the progression to a critical state (Fig. 3B).",

It has been reported that a D-dimer concentration greater than 1 mg/L on admission was associated with significantly increased risk of mortality for patients with COVID-1922. We found that DIP adjunctive treatment blunted the increase in D-dimer concentrations, and increased the counts of circulating platelets and leucocytes. High concentrations of D-dimers are closely correlated with pulmonary embolism42, vascular thrombosis, and renal dysfunction43. It is a crucial prognostic factor and is important to determine whether ICU-patients recover from severe infections44\n,\n45.

The calculations were carried out in Gromacs 201949, and the thermodynamic cycle and procedure was similar to that used by Matteo et al.50.

Restraints were added for keeping the relative position between receptor and ligand, which consist of one distance, two angles, and three dihedrals harmonic potentials with a force constant of 10 kcal/mol/\u00c52 [rad2]. The distance and angles for the restraints were determined by the values of the last 2 ns of the 4 ns preliminary MD simulations.
