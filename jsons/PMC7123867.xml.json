Although most research into this topic has focused on human and domesticated animals as hosts, the study of wildlife diseases has been growing rapidly since the 1980s (Anderson et al. 1981; Kawata 2010; McCallum 2016). This interest has been driven by desires to minimize risks to human health (e.g., zoonotic diseases such as leptospirosis; Munoz-Zanzi et al. 2014), decrease loss of livestock [e.g., transmission of brucellosis from elk (Cervus canadensis) to cattle (Bos taurus); Xie and Horan 2009], and preserve either native or endangered species [e.g., canine distemper in the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes); Thorne and William 1988].",

Here we present a review of four types of models used in studies of wildlife infectious diseases\u2014compartmental, metapopulation, spatial, and contact network\u2014and discuss their uses, limitations, and contributions to the understanding of infectious diseases. It is important to note that although we present these four models as separate for the purpose of this review, there is in fact substantial overlap between these categories (e.g., a metapopulation model can also exhibit properties of a spatial model).",

Two of the most important quantities in epidemiology emerged from such analyses. The first, R\n0, defines the average number of secondary cases that would arise from an average primary case in an entirely susceptible population. The exact formulation of this variable depends on the type of model used (i.e., SIR versus SEIR); however, for the SIR model described above, it is given by \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ {R}_0=\\frac{\\beta }{\\gamma +\\mu } $$\n\\end{document}R0=\u03b2\u03b3+\u03bc. The force of infection, \u03bb, on the other hand, defines the per capita rate at which susceptible individuals contract the infection, and is equal to \u03b2I and \u03b2Y/N, for the proportions and number of individuals formulations, respectively. The values that these quantities take in different host-pathogen systems can determine the final outcome of the disease (e.g., R\n0 must be greater than unity for a disease to spread and less than unity to ensure eventual disease eradication; Keeling and Eames 2005; Keeling and Rohani 2008; Kawata 2010).",

Although numerous methods have been devised to improve the calculation of this value (e.g., incorporating age or transmission heterogeneity), the original formulation remains one of the most fundamental and often-used discoveries in epidemiology (Keeling et al. 2003; Garnett 2005; Yip et al. 2007). Multi-host models, on the other hand, have been used to investigate the effects of multiple hosts on maintaining infections in situations where a single host is insufficient to sustain the ongoing spread of the disease (e.g., Dobson and Meagher 1996; Gilbert et al. 2001).",

For most of the field\u2019s history, density-dependent transmission was used because of its clear analogy to how the rate of interaction between two types of molecules is directly proportional to their densities. While this framework, which yields the familiar \u03b2SI transmission term, has been applied with some success, certain populations may not display such a characteristic. For a sexually transmitted disease in humans, for example, the number of transmissible contacts (i.e., sexual partners) is often independent of population density (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2004; Ryder et al. 2007). In these situations, a frequency-dependent rate of transmission is required, which alters the transmission term to \u03b2SI/N (McCallum et al. 2001; Begon et al. 2002; Keeling and Rohani 2008).",

Because the exact formulation of the transmission term is crucial to a model\u2019s predictive and descriptive capabilities, as well as the qualitative behavior of the system itself, the relationship of contact rates to density is still an area of active research. In general, however, frequency-dependent transmission is used primarily in models of vector-borne pathogens and human populations, while density-dependent transmission is generally considered to be more applicable to plant and animal diseases (McCallum et al. 2001; Begon et al. 2002; Keeling and Rohani 2008).",

Many wildlife populations, for example, experience significant changes in transmission rates throughout the year as a result of either flocking behavior (Hosseini et al. 2004), seasonal migration (Bradley and Altizer 2005), or congregation during the breeding and molting season (Swinton et al. 1998). An additional source of seasonality that is almost exclusive to wildlife populations arises from birth pulses which recruit a large number of susceptible individuals into the population at approximately the same time each year (Gremillion-Smith and Woolf 1988; Keeling and Rohani 2008). If a time-dependent component is incorporated into the transmission term, then increasing the amplitude of seasonality can increase the number of prevalence peaks throughout the year, eventually resulting in chaotic dynamics (Ireland et al. 2004).",

This model demonstrated that the latent period of rabies could act as a time-delayed density-dependent regulator of fox population growth and result in the 4-year oscillations in population size and disease prevalence observed in fox populations throughout Europe. The authors also concluded that culling alone was unlikely to be effective once rabies becomes established within a fox population. Vaccination, on the other hand, significantly increased the odds of disease eradication, especially when combined with culling in regions with low fox density (Anderson et al. 1981).",

They discovered that not only would this strategy decrease infections in grouse, but it would also increase their fecundity as a consequence of increased life expectancy.

The authors showed that because infected prey live longer in the absence of predators, they are able to infect many more susceptible animals than they would be able to otherwise. Although this effect is more pronounced when predators selectively remove infected prey (e.g., if the infection makes prey easier to capture or locate), nonselective predation is still beneficial to host populations by reducing the life span of infectious individuals. This principle was used to retroactively explain how the introduction of private gamekeepers (who removed predators) in red grouse habitats destabilized the grouse population in North Yorkshire, England (Packer et al. 2003).",

Unfortunately, similar theory does not yet exist for the effects of altering the magnitude of seasonality in mortality rates. This avenue for future research would be particularly appealing because, unlike for births, newly developed theory could be tested by manipulating the timing, extent, and demographic characteristics of mortality through changes to harvest regulations.

The level of substructure has also been shown to be an important consideration, with higher numbers of subdivision (e.g., dividing subpopulations into smaller groups) leading to longer disease outbreaks and increased persistence (Swinton et al. 1998).

Although many modeling studies have concluded that persistence increases with the intergroup connectivity, Jesse et al. (2008) demonstrated that the relationship is strongly nonlinear. More specifically, a peak in epidemic duration appears at small movement rates (due to asynchrony in the disease dynamics between subpopulations), followed by a global maximum at larger rates (when the pathogen \u201cperceives\u201d the metapopulation as a single well-mixed population). These results are particularly applicable to outbreak management because they demonstrated that while restricting animal movement (a common response to disease outbreaks in cattle farms) will reduce the total number of subpopulations that experience infection, it may also prolong epidemic duration instead of decreasing it. At these lower movement rates, any infectious animal that does move between subpopulations has a large probability of encountering a fully susceptible subpopulation, thereby preventing the disease from dying out for an increased length of time (similar to the rescue effect in ecology). Another important conclusion is that although increasing mixing between subpopulations via habitat corridors is an effective means of species conservation (Hanski 1999), their potential as conduits for the spread of infectious diseases should be carefully considered before implementation (Hess 1994, 1996).",

An alternative approach, originally proposed by Levins (1969), models each subpopulation as being either pathologically empty (disease-free) or occupied (having infection). The intuitive way to conceptualize this is to assume that localized extinctions and successful recolonizations are extremely rare, so that each subpopulation spends the vast majority of its time either disease-free or close to the endemic equilibrium. For a large number of subpopulations with equal probabilities of infecting each other, the proportion of infected subpopulations, P, is governed by7.10\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt}=r\\left(1-P\\right)P- eP, $$\n\\end{document}dPdt=r1\u2212PP\u2212eP,where r measures the reinfection (coupling) rate from an infected subpopulation to an uninfected one and e is the rate of local extinction (Keeling and Rohani 2008).

(2011) created a metapopulation model to provide a mechanistic understanding of the causal links between anthropogenic change and emergence of new zoonoses from wildlife in Australia. As urbanization destroyed most of the contiguous forest cover on the eastern coast, fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) began switching their diet from the more patchily distributed nectar and fruit sources to urban gardens that provide abundant food year-round. Unlike the old diet that required long-distance foraging and migration, the new one required minimal migration, which decreased the connectivity between subpopulations (identified by the location of their daytime roosts). By incorporating data on within- and between-camp transmission, the authors demonstrated that the decreased migration led to increased epidemic sizes and divergence in both amplitude and frequency from epidemics in rural camps. This was due to the fact that as fewer individuals migrated, the probability of infected hosts moving between camps decreased, which lowered the probability of camps becoming reinfected after local viral extinction and increased the time over which subpopulations could recruit susceptible individuals via births. This resulting decline in herd immunity across the metapopulation shifted disease dynamics toward sporadic, shorter, and more intense local epidemics with larger numbers of infected individuals. However, if this connectivity were to drop below a certain threshold level, then the resulting movement would become insufficient to reinfect distant camps. Thus, the same conditions that are currently responsible for large and sporadic epidemics could eventually lead to viral extinction, rendering the entire population vulnerable to a large synchronized outbreak (Plowright et al. 2011).",

By successively removing each of the four species from the transmission cycle, they were able to demonstrate that the common bent-wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) is the only species essential for the persistence of the virus, because it serves as a regional reservoir in the system. In fact, if this species were removed, then even increased contact rates and interisland exchanges between the remaining three species would be insufficient to maintain rabies infections. Additionally, Pons-Salort et al.

A spatial SI model (used instead of an SIR because there is no recovery from infection at the township level) was compared to the observed data of reported rabies outbreaks and resulted in a best fit model where rivers reduced transmission by 87% compared to land boundaries; local transmission accounted for most but not all of the spatial spread; and human population density played a small but positive role in transmission (Smith et al. 2002). Although this formulation ignored within-subpopulation dynamics (i.e., a newly infected township can transmit infection as strongly as when endemic equilibrium is reached), it allowed for far richer parameterization without the need to estimate the number of raccoons in each township.",

The use of a hexagonal grid, however, helps to alleviate this problem and often better recreates observed spatial patterns (Anneville et al. 1998; Van Baalen and Rand 1998; Kao 2003; Birch et al. 2007). A more general issue is that the discretization of space forces intracell interactions to be far stronger than intercell ones, regardless of the actual distance between individuals in each cell. Two individuals that occupy adjacent corners of two separate cells, for example, would have weaker interactions than two who occupy the same cell but are at opposite ends, despite the fact that the former are closer to each other than the latter (Keeling and Rohani 2008).",

The standard reaction-diffusion model assumes that individuals move randomly throughout the landscape and that infections are only transmitted between individuals sharing the same location (K\u00e4llen et al. 1985; Murray et al. 1986; Yachi et al. 1989; Kawata 2010), resulting in the following set of equations:7.14\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial t}=\\upsilon -\\beta X Y/N-\\mu X+{D}_X{\\nabla}^2\\mathrm{X}, $$\n\\end{document}\u2202X\u2202t=\u03c5\u2212\u03b2XY/N\u2212\u03bcX+DX\u22072X,\n7.15\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial t}=\\beta XY/N-\\gamma Y-\\mu Y+{D}_Y{\\nabla}^2\\mathrm{Y}, $$\n\\end{document}\u2202Y\u2202t=\u03b2XY/N\u2212\u03b3Y\u2212\u03bcY+DY\u22072Y,\n7.16\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial t}=\\gamma Y-\\mu Z+{D}_Z{\\nabla}^2\\mathrm{Z}, $$\n\\end{document}\u2202Z\u2202t=\u03b3Y\u2212\u03bcZ+DZ\u22072Z,where X, Y, and Z are now functions of both space and time, \u22072 describes the local diffusion of individuals through space, and D\nX, D\nY, and D\nZ, are the diffusion rates for the three classes of individuals (Keeling and Rohani 2008; Kawata 2010).",

Tischendorf et al. (1998) used a spatial model to investigate the effectiveness of this program and assess the consequences of either reducing or eliminating it on the persistence of rabies. This approach involved simulating the mating, dispersal, and vaccination of fox social groups across a lattice grid, as well as the contact between and within groups. Unlike the traditional approach, each grid was able to hold one of six possible states\u2014the three \u201csimple\u201d states of infectious, empty, and susceptible and three new \u201cmixed\u201d states of susceptible plus immune, infectious plus immune, and empty plus immune (meaning that only immune foxes are present). The results of this model showed that even in a highly immunized fox population such as the one throughout Europe, rabies can still persist in the form of moving clusters of infection. The probability of disease eradication rises sharply after a mean immunization rate of 70% is reached, although a further 6 years of maintaining this level was required to guarantee rabies eradication (Tischendorf et al. 1998).",

The major result of this model showed that although bovine tuberculosis could persist for a long time in populations with a disease-free equilibrium group size of only four individuals, a group size threshold of six was required for the disease to become endemic. Additionally, increasing intergroup contact rates significantly improved the probability and rate of spread of infection and lowered the group size threshold required for endemicity. As such, perturbations of badger social groups caused by control operations could actually increase the probability of persistence (or spread) of an infection instead of preventing it (White and Harris 1995).",

Moore (1999) used the timing of first cases in each county to construct a reaction-diffusion model for the entire state and explore what factors influenced the speed and direction of the spread. The resulting contours revealed that the infection first spread northward along the corridors of the Appalachian Mountain and Great Valley sections of the state, before twisting to the west once it reached the high plateau areas in the north. These results differed from the homogeneous point diffusion process originally proposed for the rabies outbreak and were used to inform a strategic oral-bait vaccination strategy (Moore 1999).",

Although it may be tempting, for example, to select the finest scale possible based on the available data, it may be more helpful to model the spread of the disease at the same scale as that used for control and management (e.g., counties or townships; Riley et al. 2015). Finer temporal scales may also be tempting, but require substantially more data on all aspects of animal behavior that could contribute to disease spread. Kjaer (2010), for example, used a 2-hour time step to model the spread of chronic wasting disease in a hypothetical population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Berg (2016), on the other hand, modeled a similar system using a 1-week time step. Although this later approach allowed for far richer parameterization of the progress of the disease in individual animals, it came at the expense of being unable to include events that occurred at time intervals shorter than 1 week (e.g., occasional daylong excursions made by deer outside of their home range). Developing generalities about how different spatial and temporal scales influence the modeled spread of a disease can greatly improve the use of spatial models in the management and control of wildlife diseases.",

For example, because these super-spreaders can have a disproportionately high impact on the basic reproductive ratio and the epidemic threshold, network models are often used to evaluate how either vaccinating or quarantining super-spreaders will influence disease spread (Craft and Caillaud 2011; Tompkins et al. 2011). Normally, such well-connected individuals would be considered to be at highest risk of infection (Godfrey 2013). However, while this relationship does exist for many wildlife populations [e.g., brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula); Corner et al. 2003], it appears to be absent in others [e.g., meerkats (Suricata suricatta); Drewe 2009].

Although several researchers have proposed methods to account for this heterogeneity in mean-field models (e.g., Anderson et al. 1986; Newman 2002), their explicit inclusion via network modeling still provides the best predictor of disease spread (Hamede et al. 2012).",

Fenner et al.

For example, there appears to be no relationship between group size and risk of infection in gidgee skinks (Egernia stokesii; Godfrey et al. 2009). Larger primate groups, on the other hand, offset the increased parasite risk associated with group size by imposing within-group substructure (Griffin and Nunn 2011). Network models have been used to show that social interactions are often more important in disease spread than either spatial proximity or home-range overlap (Bull et al. 2012), address the issue of using different spatial scales (Davis et al. 2008), and investigate if density influences contact rates (Ji et al. 2005). Alongside these more specific applications, network models have also been used in much the same way as earlier model types\u2014to evaluate a wide range of disease control measures such as oral vaccines (Delahay et al. 2009) and culling (Ramsey et al. 2002).",

In fact, they can be parameterized to recreate almost any other model type (e.g., a compartmental model is simply a fully connected network, while a lattice-based model can be replaced by a lattice network with nearest-neighbor connectivity; Craft and Caillaud 2011). The main limitation of these models, however, is that accurate parameterization requires detailed data on the contact and movement patterns of every individual within the study population at a time scale appropriate for the transmission process (Godfrey 2013). Although ongoing advances in GPS and proximity sensor technology are helping to alleviate this problem (e.g., Leu et al. 2010; Hamede et al. 2012; Reynolds et al. 2015), accurate sampling of every individual is still neither financially nor logistically feasible except for the smallest of wildlife populations (Tompkins et al. 2011; Godfrey 2013).

Leu et al. (2010), for example, constructed a directed transmission network for a subpopulation of sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) to determine whether asynchronous use of overnight refuges (a form of indirect and directional transmissible contact) could account for observed ectoparasite loads in individual lizards. Simulating disease spread on this network provided a powerful predictor of ectoparasite loads and revealed that individuals who use many refuges had significantly lower loads as a result of a lower probability of using a previously occupied refuge. This study helped to not only identify increasing the number of available refuges as the optimum strategy for reducing disease in sleepy lizards but also provided one of the first frameworks for using contact networks to investigate the dynamics of indirectly transmitted diseases (Leu et al. 2010).",

However, it is important to realize that a population\u2019s contact structure often operates on multiple hierarchical scales (i.e., individuals form groups that exhibit their own heterogeneous contact network; Craft and Caillaud 2011). Caillaud et al. (2013) constructed an undirected, two-level (i.e., individuals interacting within groups alongside intergroup connectivity) hierarchical model for a hypothetical infectious disease to demonstrate that variation in group size significantly reduces the epidemic thresholds, as well as increases the mean and variance of small outbreak sizes. This suggests that incorporating group size heterogeneity into disease models can greatly improve their predictive capabilities, much like the incorporation of degree heterogeneity described above. The authors also introduced the concept of an epidemiological effective group size, defined as the group size in a homogeneous population that would result in the same epidemic thresholds as the heterogeneous one. By applying this concept to lions (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti National Park, Caillaud et al. (2013) demonstrated that the observed network, which exhibited highly variable pride sizes, is comparable to a homogeneous population with approximately 10\u201320% larger prides.",

These patterns were then used to generate sets of contact networks with suitable characteristics (e.g., mean degree and transitivity) that regenerated associations once every 3 months. By stochastically simulating the spread of devil facial tumor disease through these dynamic contact networks, the authors demonstrated that failure to account for seasonal contact structure significantly overestimated the time to host extinction as well as the transmissibility threshold necessary for an epidemic to occur. Interestingly, the differences in time to host extinction between network and compartmental models became negligible for transmission rates close to either zero or one, suggesting that contact heterogeneity has little effect on the dynamics of host extinction from diseases with either very low or very high transmissibility. Unfortunately, because transmission rates are likely to be intermediate for most wildlife diseases, ignoring contact structure can have negative consequences for wildlife conservation (Hamede et al. 2012).",
