Cystatins comprise a super-family (type I\u2013III) of evolutionary related proteins: Type I cystatins are cytosolic proteins, lacking disulphide bridges; Type II cystatins are found both inside and outside of cells, comprising at least 14 members; Type III cystatins are large multifunctional plasma proteins, containing three type II cystatin-like domains [3].",

However, it was not named cystatin C until early 80s, when Anastasi adopted the affinity chromatography method for the first time in the isolation, and since then, cystatin C was successively purified in different species [8]. Cystatin C can combine closely but reversibly with cysteine protease molecules. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that cystatin C has three highly conservative domains: 1) N-terminal region, including glycine-11 (sequence of cystatin C) highly conservative sequence; 2) The first hairpin loop, including highly conservative QVVAG sequence (glutamine-55-glycine-59); 3) The second hairpin loop, including proline-105 and tryptophan-106 [9]. X-ray scattering techniques were used to analyze the three dimensional structure of chicken cystatin C, and showed that the molecular center has a long alpha helix around five anti-parallel beta folded lamellar structure. At the end of the beta patches is exposed the first beta hairpin loop, the N-terminal region and second hairpin loop are located in both sides. These three structure domains constitute a wedge structure that complementary to the target enzyme's active site to play inhibition roles effectively [10].",

            "text": "Clinically, cystatin C is mostly used as a biomarker of kidney functions for its relatively lower molecular weight and easier detection to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than chemical compounds, radioisotopes or radiocontrast agents [13]. Since cystatin C is removed from the blood stream by glomerular filtration, whose decline as a result of failed kidney functions will lead to increased serum cystatin C concentration, the main determinant of blood cystatin C levels was believed to be the rate at which it is filtered at the glomerulus [14]. However, recent studies increasingly reported direct involvement of cystatin C in many immunological disorders other than renal diseases, and cystatin C encoding gene can be subject to the regulation of cytokines under inflammatory or infectious conditions [15,16]. Therefore, the oscillation of blood cystatin C levels measured by its activity could actually reflect the change of cystatin C production, consumption, inactivation or even fibrillation rather than its filtration in the kidney, and the readout of plasma cystatin C concentration might have important clinical implications. Here, we summarize the latest development of studies on the involvement of cystatin C in immune responses under inflammatory and autoimmune conditions at various levels from diseases, cells, down to the molecules. The diverse functions and clinical relevance of cystatin C foretell the involvement of this protease inhibitor in multiple pathophysiological processes, which could be strategically utilized for translational applications.",

            "text": "One of the important roles of cystatin C is to protect the host against invading microorganisms and parasites that use cysteine proteases to enter the body [2]. Cystatins have been found in epithelial cells [19], neutrophils from the liver [20], DCs of lymphoid tissue [21] and thymic medullary cells [22]. The selective expression of the inhibitor in these cells correlates with the tissues participating in the first-line of defense against pathogens. For instance, analysis of proteins uniquely involved in the development of the skin demonstrated strong expression of cystatin in neonatal mouse skin, which decreases with aging, suggesting an important role of this protease inhibitor in the development of the epidermis [23]. Furthermore, in vivo mouse models have also revealed that cystatins are key molecules in a biochemical pathway that control skin barrier formation [24,25]. The involvement of cystatins in these tissues suggests that they may have a role in the host defense mechanism against pathogenic agents, like virus for example. Along this line, cystatin has been found to interfere with coronavirus replication in human lung cells [26], partially block poliovirus replication in infected human cells [27], suppress the infectivity of adenovirus in human respiratory passage or conjunctiva [28] and herpes simplex virus in human submandibular-sublingual and parotid [29].",

In agreement with this notion, one study has demonstrated that BALB/c mice with fatal visceral leishmaniasis can be clinically cured of the disease by chicken cystatin in synergy with interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) treatment [32]. Later on, it was revealed that the successful therapy of lethal murine visceral leishmaniasis with cystatin C in combination with IFN-\u03b3 correlated with up-regulation of cystatin C and nitric oxide (NO) generation, successful Th2 to Th1 conversion at molecular and cellular levels, leading to the reduced parasite numbers and abrogation of parasite infection [33].",

The development of MHC-II needs cysteine proteinase cathepsin S to assist. Therefore, it is possible for cystatin C, as a endogenous inhibitor of the cathepsin S, to play a regulatory role in the antigen presentation by inhibiting cathepsin S during the removal of the invariant chain (Ii) to generate effective MHC-antigenic peptide complex [38].",

Furthermore, El-Sukkari showed in a separate study using mouse primary DCs isolated from cystatin C-deficient mice that cystatin C is neither necessary nor sufficient to control MHC-II expression and antigen presentation in DCs [42]. These discrepant findings obtained from different laboratories could be caused by difference among DC subsets or maturation of the DCs investigated, like bone-marrow derived DCs versus primary splenic DC, immature or steady DCs versus mature or activated DCs etc. Indeed, cystatin C was found to be differentially expressed among closely related DC subsets [42], and therefore it is not impossible that other cysteine protease inhibitors play compensatory roles in the DC subsets that lack or have limited expression of cystatin C either constitutively or following maturation or activation. In supporting this possibility, experiments using bone marrow-derived DCs indicated that interleukin (IL)-6 mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation decreased cystatin C expression [36]. Consistently, we found that IL-10 can down-regulate cystatin C expression in splenic primary DCs through interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) during systemic inflammation [43].",

The mRNA levels of cystatin were found to be increased in psoriatic plaques of the psoriasis vulgaris, a common inflammatory disease of the skin, characterized by hyper-proliferation of skin cells that ultimately leads to red, scaly plaques [46]. In addition, polymorphism in the genes for cystatin C has been associated with atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease often associated with a defective epidermal barrier [47,48]. Cystatin was found to protect skin barrier from allergic reactions, including atopic dermatitis, and inhibition of proteolytic activity of major mite allergens by cystatin blocked the up-regulation of IL-8 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release from keratinocytes stimulated with the allergens [49,50]. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in the gene for cystatins have been identified as the underlying genetic cause of another skin disease, exfoliative ichthyosis [51]. Consistently, it has been demonstrated that disturbance of the cystatin-cathepsin pathway could contribute to dys-regulated skin barrier function in vivo as was observed in the inflammatory dermatoses [47].",

Along this line, the lack of cystatin C was found to enhance CIA onset and primarily affected the in vivo priming of the immune system [61].

In agreement with the mouse data, cystatin C was also found to be the most prominent cystatin in synovial fluid of RA patients who have significantly reduced levels of cystatin C in circulation [62]. In order to compare the expression of cathepsin B and cystatin C in RA synovial membrane, a group of ten RA patients and healthy controls was chosen to examine the quantities of cathepsin B and cystatin C expression in synovium using immunohistochemical method and investigate the cellular sources that produce these two bioactive proteins [63]. The results showed that cathepsin B and cystatin C were highly expressed in RA synovial tissues, in which fibroblast-like and macrophage-like cells from fibro-proliferative tissue at the site of cartilage and bone destruction were positive for cystatin C and cathepsin B, whereas only limited expression of these molecules was exhibited in normal synovial tissue [63]. Osteoclasts also revealed positive staining for cystatin C, but not for cathepsin B, which means that cystatin C is the product of both macrophage-like and fibroblast-like synoviocytes. The strong expression of the cystatin C in the diseased rheumatoid synovium suggests that cystatin C is either correlated with the disease development, or important but insufficient to prevent matrix degradation by cathepsin B. Although the exact roles that cystatin C plays in the inflammatory lesions remain to be discovered, it could currently serve as diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target for the treatment of the autoimmune disease.",

Cystatin C amyloidogenesis starts with cystatin C dimerization by a process known as \u201cthree dimentional domain swapping\u201d, in which two parts of the cystatin structure become separated from each other and next exchanged between two molecules [70]. Interestingly, with their inhibitory region hidden within the dimer interface, cystatin C dimers cannot inhibit cysteine proteases to regulate the immunological functions of DCs [71]. To identify the mechanistic factors leading to cystatin C dimerization either as post-translational regulation of its activity, or as amyloid precursor protein, we compared the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the immature and mature states, and found strong correlation between ROS levels and cystatin C dimer not only in same cell type (DCs) at different developmental stages, but also in different cell types (DCs and macrophage) at the same developmental stages [43]. Furthermore, artificially enhancing the intracellular oxidative status resulted in a time-dependent cystatin C dimer enrichment, which could be prevented by inhibiting mitochondria activity, indicating the ROSs released from mitochondria are responsible for the observed constitutive cystatin C dimer formation and lose of its inhibitor\u2019s activity [43]. Therefore, the importance of cystatin C in DCs is manifested by its multiple controls at different levels affected by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",

Further analysis of the DC subsets directly isolated from the spleen demonstrated that the CD8+ DC were the major producer of cystatin C, with little or no expression in the closely related CD8\u2212 DC [43,72]. This differential expression pattern of cystatin C among cells of common lineages suggests that its gene could be subjected to the regulation by cell-specific transcription factors. In addition, mature DC can secrete a large number of immune-stimulatory cytokines and chemokines to induce the pro-inflammatory Th cells differentiation and memory T cells activation [73], of which IL-6 signaling in vivo was found to decrease cystatin C expression in DCs [36]. Along the same line, we found that in an inflammatory mouse model created by intravenous injection of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, mimics of bacterial and viral DNA responsible for immune stimulation, the synthesis of cystatin C in DCs as well as the circulating pools of cystatin C in blood were greatly reduced [74]. Collectively, these data suggest that cystatin C can affect the functions of DCs, which in turn secrete inflammatory cytokines to regulate cystatin C expression for further immune regulation.",

Treatment of resident mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro with the bacterial compound lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or pro-inflammatory IFN-\u03b3 could down-regulate cystatin C secretion [65]. Consistently, during inflammation, reduced cystatin C secretion was accompanied by increased activities of cysteine proteases in macrophage microenvironment [78]. The variation of cystatin C production in these conditions, can in turn affect immune system by regulating cytokine secretion from these cells. For example, in early phase of parasite infection, cystatin C can induce human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to secrete tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), reduce IL-12 but increase IL-10 generation. Since IL-10 is a known inhibitory cytokine to inhibit Th1 cell differentiation and T cell proliferative responses to antigen stimulation, the cystatin C induced IL-10 generation may participate in host T cell conversion from Th1 into Th2, skewing the host immune system to favor parasite propagation [79].",

It has been documented that cystatin C is involved in the IFN-\u03b3 signal transduction pathway.Previously it has been shown that in vitro treatment of murine peritoneal macrophages with IFN-\u03b3 causes a down-regulation of cystatin C secretion [89]. Conversely, it is curious to know whether cystatin C in turn can affect inflammatory responses mediated by IFN-\u03b3 in macrophages. To this end, the effects of IFN-\u03b3 on macrophages isolated from cystatin C knockout (cystatin C\u2212/\u2212) and wild-type (cystatin C+/+) mice were compared. It was shown that, in cystatin C\u2212/\u2212 macrophages, IFN-\u03b3 induced higher IL-10, but lower TNF-\u03b1 expression, compared to the similarly primed cystatin C+/+ cells [90], indicating an indispensable role of cystatin C in regulating the IFN-\u03b3 induced inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages.",

First, exogenously added cystatin C to cystatin C\u2212/\u2212 macrophages enhanced IFN-\u03b3 induced activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) p65, which is known to regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules such as TNF-\u03b1 and NO [91]. Furthermore, cystatin C was found to be able to synergize with IFN-\u03b3 to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity, as pretreatment of cells with specific inhibitors of NF-\u03baB or ERK1/2 pathway blocked the cystatin plus IFN-\u03b3-inducible NF-\u03baB activity [82]. Moreover, increased mRNA levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), as well as the levels of NO and TNF-\u03b1 were found in the cell culture medium of IFN-\u03b3 and cystatin C treated macrophages [92].Cystatin C was also reported to affect T cell polarizing cytokine production in response to IFN-\u03b3 signaling. Transcript levels of IL-4 were found to be reduced in the mice given combined therapy of IFN-\u03b3 and cystatin C, whereas IL-12 was significantly elevated [93], indicating that cystatin C has the potential to facilitate the IFN-\u03b3-induced switch of T cell differentiation from Th2 to Th1 in favor of eliminating pathogen infection. Collectively, these data suggested that as an immunomodulatory molecule, cystatin C alters the responses of immune cells to IFN-\u03b3 [92].",

Further study revealed that the cystatin C involved iNOS expression is mostly controlled by two regulatory regions present in the iNOS promoter, which contains binding sequences for two transcription factors, NF-\u03baB and IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) [100]. Later on, a number of studies demonstrated a direct correlation between ERK1/2 activation and up-regulation of both NF-\u03baB activity and NO production through the participation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) [82,101].",

For example, TGF-\u03b2 can inhibit the maturation of DCs, that make T cells unable to differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or Ths, thus promoting tumorigenesis [103]. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 was also found to promote the proliferation of Tregs in vitro and increase the expression of HLA-DR in Tregs to enhance the immunosuppressive function [104]. Moreover, there were also evidences to suggest a negative regulatory roles of TGF-\u03b2 in NK cells and monocytes [103]. Based on existing research findings, it has been well established that cystatin C can antagonize the suppressive functions of TGF-\u03b2 via physically interacting with its receptor or its signaling molecules.TGF-\u03b2 mediates its biological activities via binding to cell surface receptors with high affinity [105]. The inhibitory effect of \u039414Cst C, a cystatin C mutant that lacks the cysteine protease inhibitor signature sequences, on TGF-\u03b2 signaling suggested that cystatin C may inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling by antagonizing the interaction between TGF-\u03b2 and its receptors [106]. This hypothesis seemed especially attractive given the fact that the type III cystatin family member, fetuin (also known as \u03b12-HSglycoprotein), inhibits TGF-\u03b2 signaling by physically interacting with and preventing the binding of TGF-\u03b2 to its receptors [107]. Consistently, down-regulation of tumor development through a similar mechanism has also been shown for a cystatin that inhibits colon carcinogenesis by blocking the interaction of TGF-\u03b2 with cell surface receptors to suppress its signal transduction [108]. In agreement with these in vitro findings, the growth, weight, and proliferative index of 4T1 tumors in BALB/c mice were inhibited significantly by their expression of either cystatin C or \u039414Cst C in vivo via antagonizing the efficacy of TGF-\u03b2 [109].",

Immunohistochemistry studies were conducted to monitor the activation status of all three TGF-\u03b2 effectors, drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein (Smad), p38 MAPKs and ERK1/2, by staining with phospho-specific antibodies [109]. The result shows that the phosphorylation and activation of these effectors were inhibited significantly in cells expressing cystatin C compared with their control samples [109], suggesting that cystatin C can block the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway partly by decreasing the phosphorylation of Smad2, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2, although the physical evidence for the direct interaction between cystatin C and these signaling effectors remain to be identified.",

            "text": "Cystatin C plays an important role in the apoptosis of lymphocytes to maintain their high potency by inhibiting cathepsin-induced endonuclease activation for DNA fragmentation. During their life span, both B and T lymphocytes encounter various episodes of selection. The basic selection mechanism is the survival of highly specific B or T cells with strong affinity to the antigens at the cost of their non-specific counterparts with lower affinity, which die by apoptosis. B cell apoptosis can be induced at several stages and requires the activities of both caspases and cathepsins, because triggering of the BCR causes a cathepsin-like proteinase to leak out of the lysosomal compartment and activate the downstream caspases to regulate the activity of endonuclease for DNA fragmentation [115]. Interestingly, the occurrence of DNA strand breaks in B and T cells could be prevented by addition of analogue of cystatin C to inhibit cysteine proteinase activity [116]. In addition, a comparable mechanism was found when apoptosis was induced with bile salts or virus in cell lines, where cystatin was capable of inhibiting cathepsin B downstream of caspases to protect cells from death [117,118]. Consistently, large amounts of cystatins exist in- or out-side cells to inhibit the endonuclease activity via cathepsins [21]. In addition, cystatin C can also inhibit cathapsin C-mediated cathapsin G leakage to control apoptosis. Neutrophils are short-lived cells and their life span forms a crucial mechanism for maintaining immune system homeostasis, as extended survival of neutrophils may lead to chronic inflammation, but reduced number of living neutrophils may enhance susceptibility to infections [119]. Of note, neutrophil cultured in the presence of cystatin C resulted in a significant drop in apoptotic cell percentage compared to the controls, and this hampering effects on neutrophil apoptosis was attributed to its inhibitory influence on cathepsin activity [120]. Consistently, it was found that cathepsin G was involved in apoptosis by activating recombinant procaspase-7 [121]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that when errors occur in packaging, de-granulation or phagocytosis, cathepsin G was introduced into the cytoplasm and induced morphological changes that are characteristic for apoptosis [122]. Since cathepsin C is involved in post-translational processing and activation of cathepsin G [123], the inhibition of cathepsin C by cystatin could impair the cathepsin G-induced apoptosis in neutrophils.",

Cathepsin C has the ability to activate granzyme through removing dipeptides from its amino terminus [125,126]. It has recently been demonstrated that although cathepsin knockout mice contain normal levels of granzymes, all granzymes were not active, indicating that cathepsin is required for the activation of granzyme- and granule-mediated apoptosis [127,128].

The involvement of cystatin C in host immunity is multifaceted and tridimensional, covering every stage of immune responses in both innate and adaptive immunity, and interfering with various immunological abnormalities during inflammation, autoimmune diseases and tumor development in compromised immune surveillance. It has become evident that disturbances in the expression and localization of cystatin C may be either the casual or effector factor of the pathological processes. To support this notion, growing evidences demonstrated that cystatin C could interact with numerous inflammatory factors and mediators to regulate the inflammation process at molecular levels. Moreover, the influences of cystatin C on the immune cells are not only limited to their functions, but also extended to their survivals, causing tumor development or autoimmunity.",

On the other hand, the cytokines that repress cystatin C expression, such as IL-10, could be developed for the treatment of diseases associated with too much cystatin C in apoptosis or formation of cystatin C amyloid like Icelandic type of Hereditary Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy. Moreover, since cystatin C itself has been proven successful in switching the inefficient Th2 cytokine response to an effective Th1 response that cleared the parasite infection in an animal model, it is tempting to speculate that the recombinant product would work in clinical trials.

Since cystatin C is involved in inflammatory autoimmune diseases, in which immune cells accumulated and played important roles, bone marrow-derived cells are an important cellular source for cystatin C manipulation. Along this line, we found that hematopoietic cells contribute significantly to the systematic pools of cystatin C [43]. Therefore, bone marrow transplantation would be an applicable approach in clinic to treat patients with cystatin C angiopathy or reduction. It is not difficult to speculate that many agents or cystatin C derivatives as an immune regulator would be developed in near future for the treatment of diseases associated with cystatin C related inflammation or autoimmunity.",

Decreased Cst C up-regulates the activities of cathepsins, facilitating the cell matrix degradation, and IgG1 and IL-10 production to ensure a Th2-like response in favor of parasite proliferation. In addition, decreased Cst C promotes the interference of cathepsin with MHC-II loading in APCs to suppress host immunity against pathogen invasion. Increased or exogenously added Cst C in IFN-\u03b3 induced macrophages, on the other hand, down-regulates the cathepsin activities to increase IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and NO generation that shift the immune responses towards protective Th1 immunity. Alternatively, Cst C can also disturb immmune homeostasis independent of cathepsins by antagonizing the binding of TGF-\u03b2 to its receptor, or directly causing inflammation through formation of Cst C fibrils deposited in vascular walls.

On the other hand, induction of Cst C was found to decrease Bcl-2 expression and increase Bid protein to promote apoptosis through cyt c release from mitochondria.
