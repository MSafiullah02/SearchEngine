For 6 months since the outbreak of SARS, there has been no LTx. Two patients on the waiting list died during this period. The Intensive Care Unit had to be dedicated to patients with SARS until recently. Two LTx team members were struck by SARS and have been out of action for 2 months. A survey using a standard psychological questionnaire was conducted among LTx recipients and their family members (n = 45). All respondents demonstrated symptoms of anxiety and stress; 30% suffered a moderate degree and 70% a mild degree of the illness. Among 29 LTx recipients being regularly followed by our out-patient clinic, 4 LTx recipients were treated at the Emergency Department for suspected SARS, which were later confirmed to be false alarms. Although none of the LTx recipients had contacted the disease, 6 LTx patients were too frightened to come back to the hospital for their follow-up appointments.",

Chinese scientists reported that the genetic makeup of a virus isolated from human patients with SARS was similar to a virus found in animals that had been captured and held in a retail food market.4 Tests showed that the animals (civets, raccoon-dogs, and ferret badgers) had a coronavirus that was 99.8% genetically identical to the virus that causes SARS in humans. The fact that this strain of coronavirus is a common pathogen among animals indicates likely zoonoses. With the LTx and other hospital essential services almost completely paralyzed, the cost to the health system was enormous. Two patients on the waiting list have died so far, but the mortality rate is expected to increase as a delayed phenomenon.",

The implication of future organ donation from people with SARS virus is an unknown concern. With xenografts there are enhanced risks of zoonosis because of the intimate contact between the recipient and animal tissues, disruption of anatomical barriers, and heightened immunosuppression. The full spectrum of infectious agents potentially transmitted via xenotransplantation is not well-known. The outbreak of SARS should be taken as a serious reminder of the potential deadly consequences of zoonoses.",
