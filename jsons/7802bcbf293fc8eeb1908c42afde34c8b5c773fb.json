However, many at-risk individuals do not get vaccinated, 4 and some vulnerable groups such as the very elderly and the immunosuppressed respond poorly to the vaccine. Furthermore, protection is reduced if there is a mismatch between the circulating strain and the vaccine, and in the event of a newly emerging influenza strain, such as the recent pandemic A (H1N1) 2009, vaccines may be unavailable for several months. Antiviral drugs are available; the M2 protein inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir) shorten and reduce severity of illness and may reduce complications, but need to be commenced within 48 hours of onset. 5 Resistance has already emerged in some strains and remains a potential risk for the future. 6 Therefore, it is important that we continue to investigate new therapies that can be used independently or in conjunction with treatments currently available.",

Oral IFN administration at very low doses is believed to mimic a natural mode of action and result in a concentration of type 1 IFN in local nasal mucosa similar to that induced by exposure to respiratory viruses. Investigation into the physiological levels of endogenous type 1 IFN during viral infections has reported levels between 116 IU/ml 8 and 138 IU/ml 9 in nasal secretions and only 10-30 IU/ml in serum. 9 This is approximately 10 000-100 000 times less than doses delivered parenterally for the treatment of hepatitis C. The use of IFN at such low doses means treatment is relatively inexpensive.",

Early reports from Russia using intranasal interferon indicated that it could be an effective prophylaxis and treatment. 10, 11 Follow-up studies conducted elsewhere found minimal benefits and unacceptable side effects when high-dose intranasal IFN (>10 6 International Units, IU) was used. [12] [13] [14] [15] Intranasal IFN prophylaxis has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of rhinovirus infection, demonstrating a dose-response relationship. Increasing doses were associated with increasing efficacy but also increased local adverse effects, mainly irritation of the nasal mucosa. [16] [17] [18] Interestingly, data from murine studies suggest that lowdose IFN can be more effective than higher doses, [19] [20] [21] indicating that low-dose oral IFN may be effective despite the disappointing previous experience. While the mechanism underlying effective low-dose oral IFN therapy is unknown, murine studies have shown that IFN-a administered to the oral cavity is retained by tissues proximal to lymphoid regions, including the posterior nasal cavity, posterior tongue and small intestine, 22 and type I interferon receptors are also present at high concentrations in the oropharyngeal cavity and elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. 19 It is hypothesized that IFN delivered by the oral route binds to receptors on specialized cells in the oral and/or pharyngeal cavity and elicits a therapeutic immune response without the need for delivery of exogenous IFN into the systemic circulation. 7 Oral administration of low-dose recombinant IFN 1 has been shown to produce immunomodulatory effects in animal studies 19, 20, 23 and human clinical trials, [24] [25] [26] and to reduce influenza mortality in a mouse model. 21 It has been well tolerated in these trials with no evidence of significant adverse effects. Therefore, we undertook a clinical trial to examine the efficacy of low-dose oral IFN in the prevention of acute respiratory illness during the winter influenza season in Western Australia in 2009, which coincided with the emergence of the pandemic A/(H1N1) 2009 virus.",

Participants were randomized into one of two treatments groups: 150 IU IFNa lozenges or placebo lozenges. During the 16-week treatment period, participants were asked to dissolve one lozenge in their mouth each morning. Compliance was monitored through the use of the weekly health data questionnaire. Participants were asked to report how many days they had taken the trial medication. These counts were confirmed at the end of the study when participants returned the trial medication, and the remaining lozenges were counted.",

However, individual symptom reports showed a~50% reduction in the incidence of moderate-to-severe episodes of feverishness in the 150 IU IFNa population; trends were also observed in the reduction of head congestion (P = 0\u00c1053) and sore throat (P = 0\u00c1056). This study also found that while the overall incidence of ARI was not reduced by IFN prophylaxis, post hoc analysis of the data demonstrated a protective effect in males, those aged 50 years and above and those who had received the 2009 southern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine ( Figure 1B-D) . These were all independent predictors of a beneficial IFNa effect. Also, the IFNa treatment group had significantly fewer vaccinated participants compared with the placebo group (Table 1 ) and may have biased against an IFNa effect in this study. For the age effects, we chose to analyse the effect of IFNa on participants aged 50 years and above separately because they represented approximately 50% of our study population and are also recognized to be at increased risk of severe or complicated influenza. 28 There were insufficient numbers to look in older age groups, such as those aged 65 years and above. Sex and age differences in the effects of type 1 IFN on hepatitis C 29,30 and in cytokinebased immune responses have previously been reported, but the mechanisms behind these observations are unknown. [31] [32] [33] The apparent effect of IFNa in participants who had received the 2009 seasonal vaccine is intriguing and suggests that the IFNa may have improved cross-protection against the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 strain following seasonal influenza vaccination. It has been reported that the 2009 seasonal trivalent vaccine also afforded cross-protection from confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza illness in up to 34% of those vaccinated. 34 It has also been shown that prior exposure to pandemic H1N1 influenza strains that circulated until 1957 established immunological memory in the older population providing clinical protection from severe illness. 35, 36 While the mechanism underlying these effects is unknown, animal studies suggest immunological priming of cross-reactive memory CD4 + T cells and cytolytic CD8 + T cells. [37] [38] [39] Others have proposed, and we agree, that IFN likely acts as an adjuvant further enhancing dendritic cell function to drive both humoral and cell-mediated cross-protection [40] . Further studies designed to confirm and further investigate these effects are required.",

That contrasts with a recent study reporting that human IFNa-2b nose and throat spray prevented acute viral respiratory infections in military recruits. 35 This may be due to differences in the IFN dose and route of administration, study populations and study design (they conducted their study over a 5-day period) or limitations in their diagnostic testing. The study used IgM detection in single serum samples, which may have significantly underestimated infection rates in adults. 34, 36, 37 We did, however, find that patients with serologically confirmed respiratory viral infection taking IFNa had a significantly lower incidence of moderate or severe symptoms ( Figure 2B ). Similar results have previously been reported following intranasal administration of IFNa (1 9 10 4 IU/day) where there was no reduction in serological influenza infections, but clinical illness was milder in the interferon group. 38 These findings suggest that while lowdose oral IFNa prophylaxis does not reduce the risk of infection with influenza or other respiratory viruses, it does appear to ameliorate the symptoms. That is consistent with our other findings of a significant reduction in feverishness in those on IFNa prophylaxis.",

Therefore, we were unable to assess the role of respiratory virus infections that could not be detected serologically, such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses or human metapneumovirus. We also did not directly measure endogenous local or systemic IFN levels. A recent murine study found low-dose intranasal IFNa treatment to be protective against a lethal H5N1 influenza A challenge and also reported that low-dose IFN treatment had an additive effect on IFNa induction and enhanced the production of interferonstimulated genes detected in the lungs. 39 In summary, our results show that 150 IU IFNa administered via the oral route was not effective in limiting the overall incidence of ARI in the study population or in reducing the impact of respiratory virus infections on daily activities. However, we did find evidence that it reduces the severity of illness though; in this study, that effect was not sufficient to reduce the impact on daily activities. Furthermore, the benefits of IFNa prophylaxis may be more substantial in certain subpopulations, that is, males, those aged 50 years or more and those who had received seasonal influenza vaccination. Further studies would help clarify whether IFNa reduces the severity of illness and complications of influenza and other respiratory infections in the elderly and other high-risk groups. Additionally, they are needed to determine the potential for IFNa to enhance vaccine-induced protection against influenza.",
