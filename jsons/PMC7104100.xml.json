The disease was firstly reported in China in 2013, with main manifestations of flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, and so on [3]. Severe pneumonia prompts critical condition, often in combination with ARDS, infectious shock, and so on. Chest CT scanning and diagnostic imaging are the important means for its clinical diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation [4]. This group of 19 cases with severe pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza A (H7N9) had received more than three times of chest CT scanning. After comprehensive analysis, the CT manifestations of these patients include: (1) The lesions are more often found at the lower lung lobes, with 17 cases of this group showing lesions at 1 or 2 lower lung lobes. With progress of the disease, the lesions rapidly progress to involve multiple segments and lobes of both lungs, often 3 or more lung lobes up to all segments and lobes of both lungs. Pulmonary opacities are mainly located at the dorsal part of lungs. (2) Ground-glass opacities and pulmonary opacities are the cardinal imaging infestations to severe pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza A (H7N9). When the condition is mild or at its early stage, the lesions are mainly ground-glass opacities. At the evolving phase, the percentage of pulmonary opacities increases, with air bronchogram in the pulmonary opacities. Ground-glass opacities mainly distribute at the anterior border of pulmonary opacities, showing as sporadic patchy opacities, even as \u201cwhite lung\u201d when in severe condition. The patient may develop significant hypoxemia, respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. (3) Pleural effusion is also one of the imaging features of human infected avian influenza A (H7N9), with 13 cases of this group showing pleural effusion, and its incidence rate is higher than the previous report [5]. It may be related to the fact that all patients of this group suffered from severe pneumonia. The pleural effusion may be caused by systemic inflammatory response triggered by direct involvement of pleura by virus and/or virus evoked cytokine storm. (4) Pulmonary interstitial fibrosis is the main findings at the recovery phase, with all cases of this group showing as small patchy shadow under the pleura and/or at dorsal part of lower lobes. Fibriform cords, latticed shadows, fragmented ground-glass opacities and other pulmonary fibrosis are also CT changes. At the same time, in this group, subpleural paraseptal emphysema and ulotic emphysema, subpleural bullas and localized bronchiectasis are observable.2.The relationship between CT manifestations and histopathological findings in the cases of severe pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza A (H7N9).\n",

The hemagglutinin in the tunica external of influenza virus A plays a key role in the pathomechanism of human infected avian influenza A (H7N9). Inflammatory factors may be mediate systemic inflammatory response syndrome and ARDS. Therefore, severe pneumonia is demonstrated as extensive ground-glass opacities and obvious consolidation by CT scan whose underlying mechanism is damaged pulmonary alveoli and pulmonary capillaries caused by virus, extensive effusion of pulmonary interstitium and pulmonary parenchyma [6]. Diffuse alveolar damage, interstitial fibrosis and air cavity extension, infiltration of leukomonocyte and plasma cells were demonstrated by histopathology. Therefore, the CT manifestations of severe pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza A (H7N9) can be explained by the histopathologic findings as its pathomechanism. And, the main pathological changes of body organs are the result of phagocytosis of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets by macrophages, known as reactive hemophagocytic syndrome. It can also explain different degrees of reduction of peripheral blood counts by clinical laboratory tests at the early and evolving phases of severe pneumonia cause by human infected avian influenza A (H7N9). And the varying degrees damage of CD4T lymphocytes indicates immune responses.3.The differential diagnosis of severe pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza A (H7N9)\n",

Pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza A (H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9) is all caused by influenza A virus, all with flu-like symptoms. The conditions are demonstrated as multiple ground-glass opacities in different sizes and consolidation by chest CT scan [7], [8], [9], [10]. Compared to pneumonia caused by influenza A (H1N1), the lesions caused by H5N1 and H7N7 occupy a larger range and develop more rapidly, and air bronchogram is more common. The disease progressions of influenza H5N1 is rapid, following by H7N9 and H1N1. By CT scans, pneumonia caused by influenza A (H5N1) is mainly displayed as large patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidation at both lungs. The lesions distribute widely and progress rapidly [7], [8]. In some cases, the lesions are erratic and absorbed slowly, with obvious pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and a mortality rate of about 59%. Onset from middle lobe and lower lobe of lungs, the lesions in the cases of human infected avian influenza A (H7N9) are mainly displayed as ground-glass opacities and lung consolidation, which change rapidly and are absorbed slowly, too [2], [6], [11], with a mortality rate of about 36%. The lesions are mainly displayed as multiple patchy ground-glass opacities and patchy or large patchy high-density consolidation in the cases with influenza A (H1N1), with segmental atelectasis and pleural effusion [10], [12] as well as a mortality rate of about 6%. Only based on radiological findings, the identification of infections by these different influenza viruses is challenging. And the differential diagnosis should be made in combination to epidemiological and etiological findings. Chest CT scans also display SARS as ground-glass opacities and lung consolidation, which progress rapidly with involvement of both lungs in about 50% of the patients, more often at middle and lower lung lobes. The lesions mainly distribute in the peripheral pulmonary tissue, with detectable interlobular septal thickening by high-resolution CT as broken paving-stones. Accompanying bronchiolectasis and a small quantity pleural effusion are also detectable [13]. These findings resemble to those of human infected avian influenza A (H7N9), but the interstitial changes in the cases of human infected avian influenza A (H7N9) are not obvious. The lesions of human infected avian influenza A (H7N9) show up in a more extensive range, with no obvious coverage at the peripheral pulmonary tissue. Epidemiological history and laboratory tests for its pathogen are the key to identify the two conditions.",

These lesions onset from middle and lower lobes of both lungs, and the condition may develop into pulmonary cavity or aerothorax, hydropneumothorax. The differential diagnosis for identification of influenza A virus (including H7N9, H5N1 and H1N1) is challenging based only on radiological findings. And their identification should be made in combination to epidemiological and etiological findings. Cross analysis of radiology and pathology is a way to further understand severe pneumonia caused by human infected avian influenza A (H7N9). And such a study is beneficial to clinical observation and evaluation of the condition, and is of great significance for disease control and mortality reduction.",
