Aircraft travel has hastened the spread of influenza strains (Laurel et al. 2001; Brownstein et al. 2006; Khan et al. 2009 ) and led to the intercontinental spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 (World Health Organization 2003) . In addition, close public quarters in aircraft cabins are a concern for disease transmission (Mangili and Gendreau 2005) , although documented cases of disease transmission onboard airplanes are limited (Moser et al. 1979; Kenyon et al. 1996; Olsen et al. 2003; Mangili and Gendreau 2005; Byrne 2007; Han et al. 2009; Baker et al. 2010) . To make appropriate, costeffective public health decisions, information about infectious viruses in aircraft is needed. Two recent studies have determined that a variety of respiratory viruses are present in symptomatic air travellers (Luna et al. 2007; Follin et al. 2009) . However, at present, it is not known which viruses are typically present in aircraft cabin air, whether viruses are often present in infectious amounts (Fabian et al. 2008; Stelzer-Braid et al. 2009; Wagner et al. 2009; Hwang et al. 2011 ) and whether viruses survive degradation in cabin air to remain viable or detectable (Weber and Stilianakis 2008; Tang 2009 ). To our knowledge, only two studies have detected viruses in aircraft cabin air to date (La Duc et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2011) .",

Methods and Results: The ResPlex II assay was first tested for its ability to detect inactivated viruses applied to new filter material; all 18 applications of virus at a high concentration were detected. The ResPlex II assay was then used to test for 18 respiratory viruses on 48 used air filter samples from commercial aircraft. Three samples tested positive for viruses, and three viruses were detected: rhinovirus, influenza A and influenza B. For 33 of 48 samples, internal PCR controls performed suboptimally, suggesting sample matrix effect. Conclusion: In some cases, influenza and rhinovirus RNA can be detected on aircraft air filters, even more than 10 days after the filters were removed from aircraft. Significance and Impact of the Study: With protocol modifications to overcome PCR inhibition, air filter sampling and the ResPlex II assay could be used to characterize viruses in aircraft cabin air. Information about viruses in aircraft could support public health measures to reduce disease transmission within aircraft and between cities. environments (Echavarria et al. 2000; Farnsworth et al. 2006; Stanley et al. 2008) . Aircraft filter material is not expected to be as efficient as other methods for collecting intact, infectious viruses because filter material may damage virus structure or damage viruses via desiccation (Mahony 2008; Verreault et al. 2008) . Nevertheless, viral nucleic acids may remain detectable via PCR and RT-PCR. Used air filters offer a potential advantage over other sampling methods for characterizing viral diversity in aircraft because they sample air over a long period, up to 15 000 h of flight time.",

The ResPlex II assay (QIAGEN) uses multiplex PCR and RT-PCR, coupled to bead-based flow cytometry to detect 18 different viral genetic sequences. Versions of this assay have been used to detect respiratory viruses in human samples with high sensitivity and specificity (Brunstein and Thomas 2006; Li et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2009 ); Li et al. reported sensitivity of 72-90% and specificity of 99AE7-100% for six viruses in 360 clinical specimens. In this study, we evaluate the ability of the ResPlex II assay to detect inactivated viruses applied to new HEPA filters and viruses extracted from used HEPA filters from commercial aircraft.",

To verify that 70\u00b0C sufficiently dry-disinfected HEPA filters, filter samples after dry-disinfection were tested, and they generated subthreshold signal intensities (1-29 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the ResPlex II assay described below.) New filter material was chosen instead of used filters in part because there was tremendous variability in the loading of nonbiological contaminants (e.g. lint, soot, oil) on used filters such that 'typical' filters could not be selected for testing. Furthermore, used filters may have gathered biological contaminants that could then interfere with the test results in the form of true positives or false positives. Three inactivated viruses were used: influenza A (INFA; ZeptoMetrix # NATFLUAH1-ST, lot # 303949), respiratory syncytial virus type A (RSVA; ZeptoMetrix # NATRSVA-ST, lot# 304994) and parainfluenza virus type 2 (PIV2; ZeptoMetrix # NATPARA2-ST, lot# 303911). Viruses were diluted 1 : 100 in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), a reagent for stabilizing RNA, and 400 ll of each was applied to a separate HEPA filter sample. For INFA, the virus manufacturer (ZeptoMetrix, Buffalo, NY, USA) indicated that the stock solution contained approximately 7 \u00b7 10 8 virus copies based on quantitative PCR, which corresponds to the addition of 2AE8 \u00b7 10 6 influenza virus copies per filter material. For RSVA and PIV2, the virus manufacturer indicated that the initial viral stocks contained virus numbers in the range of 10 8 -10 9 copies per ml. This initial viral stock range indicates that the numbers of virus copies added to each filter sample for RSVA and PIV2 were similar to that for INFA.",

As a positive control for each time-point-virus combination, the same virus solution that was applied to the filter sample was applied directly into the ResPlex II assay in one replicate each. Additionally, in the analysis of used filter samples, inactivated viruses were also used as a positive control. For this, 133 ll of the 1 : 100 dilutions of INFA, RSVA and PIV2 were applied together to a single new filter sample; this corresponds to 9AE3 \u00b7 10 5 influenza virus copies and comparable amounts of the other viruses added to the sample.",

Applied viruses were detected at all three time-points (0, 4 or 16 h) after application and drying, indicating that detectable viral RNA can persist on filter material for at least 16 h. To evaluate whether there was RNA loss owing to extraction, MFIs from the 18 test samples were compared to MFIs from positive controls, which consisted of virus directly applied to the assay without filter application and extraction.

There were also borderline positive results for coronavirus (OC43; causes common cold), INFB and RhV (Table 1) To assess whether amplification and detection performed properly, each sample contained an internal control consisting of an artificial transcript that can be amplified and detected by the assay. The internal control yielded MFI ranging from 371 to 842 in used filter samples that had positive or borderline positive results for viruses; these values are consistent with the assay performing as expected. Internal control values in this range (MFI \u2021 370) were seen in only seven of the 40 used filter samples that were negative for all viruses. Among the 33 samples with internal control MFI below 370, 19 had internal control MFI below the recommended 250 positive cut-off value.

            "text": "It is noteworthy that viral RNA was detectable even though preservation of the samples did not occur until 11-22 days after filters were removed from aircraft. While viruses can degrade rapidly, detectable viral RNA has been shown to persist on banknotes for more than 10 days (Thomas et al. 2008) . More rapid preservation of filter samples might improve detection. Despite some positive results, poor amplification of PCR internal controls in many samples indicates that the protocol did not consistently perform at optimal conditions. The ResPlex II assay and many aspects of the nucleic acid extraction procedure were designed for clinical samples, not for air samples, which are known to present two additional challenges: contaminants that inhibit PCR and low amounts of DNA and RNA (Alvarez et al. 1995; Blachere et al. 2009; Fabian et al. 2009 ). It is likely that contaminants inhibiting PCR caused the poor amplification seen for controls in many samples, as has occurred in other studies of air samples (Alvarez et al. 1995; Blachere et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2009 ). Even in samples with positive virus results, MFI values were not high, suggesting that the amounts of viral RNA in the samples may have been low. The use of other nucleic extraction methods is likely to result in improved viral RNA yield and reduced PCR inhibition. In particular, Fabian et al. recently reported that a Trizol-chloroform extraction method resulted in good yield and removal of PCR inhibitors for influenza virus; this paper also noted that a magnetic bead extraction method, similar to that in the QIAGEN EZ kit we used in our experiments, resulted in poor viral RNA yield (Fabian et al. 2009 ). In addition, the recently developed Synchronous Coefficient of Drag Alteration (SCODA) nucleic acid isolation method is reported to remove contaminants well (Broemeling et al. 2008) . Finally, we note that our collaborators have consistently recovered and performed PCR on DNA from these aircraft filter samples using a modified Miller protocol (Miller et al. 1999 ) that involves phenol-chloroform-isoamyl extraction and a soil extraction kit for additional clean-up (unpublished data.)",

The ResPlex II supplier, QIA-GEN, indicates that the lower limit of detection is about 20-50 virus copies per RT-PCR (communication from QIAGEN technical support.) This implies that there would be a detection limit of 120-300 viruses per filter sample if there were no reduction owing to PCR inhibition and no loss in extraction; given the evidence for loss of RNA during extraction, a limit of detection equal to or greater than 10 3 virus particles per filter sample is likely.",

Because air filters serve on aircraft for long periods of time, filter samples are unlikely to be used for frequent monitoring of viruses. However, the long sampling periods should make aircraft air filters especially useful for comprehensively characterizing viral background in an environment with a diverse international population. This information would provide a snapshot of infectious viruses in human populations that could inform public health efforts. In addition, this information could inform policies to reduce the spread of disease via aircraft, and technologies to reduce pathogens in aircraft. Finally, commercial aircraft is a focus of security concerns, and the ability to detect viruses in aircraft is an important step towards designing biosensors that detect and warn about dangerous viruses.",
