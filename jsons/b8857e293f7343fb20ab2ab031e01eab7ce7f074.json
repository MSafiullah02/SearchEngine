The allergic cascade has been a focal point of research interest for decades. Upon allergen exposure, mast cells within the airway sensitised with allergen specific IgE are triggered to release a number of pre-formed mediators packaged in their granules. The granules contain histamine, which act on ASM and causes the immediate bronchoconstriction of the airway, observed in asthma. Mast cells synthesise prostaglandins, leukotrienes and kinins which can contribute to bronchoconstriction, and are also a source of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which serve to increase class switching to IgE in B cells, and augment the production of various Th2 chemokines from epithelial and ASM cells. IL-13 is also highly associated with airway hyperreactivity in animal models of asthma (Leigh et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004) . Mast cells also produce various chemokines attracting inflammatory neutrophils, Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, and eosinophils into the airway. Th2 lymphocytes are a further source of Th2 cytokines, including IL-5, essential for eosinophil differentiation from bone marrow (for a review, see Renauld, 2001) . Recruitment of these various cell types, especially Th2 cells are thought to contribute to the late asthmatic response, (LAR) which features further bronchoconstriction and AHR.

The p50 and p65 subunits are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the other three are generally restricted to specific differentiated cell types (reviewed in Siebenlist et al., 1994) . In resting cells, the majority of NF-\u03baB is bound to I\u03baB inhibitory protein which masks the nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) and holds the complex in the cytoplasm. There are a number of different I\u03baB proteins such as I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, I\u03baB\u03b3, I\u03baB\u025b and Bcl-3. It is generally believed that the different isoforms are associated with particular Rel protein dimers, bound via their RHD. For example I\u03baB\u03b1 and I\u03baB\u03b2 associate with p65:p50 and p50:c-Rel, whereas I\u03baB\u025b only binds to p65 and c-Rel hetero and homodimers. Upon appropriate stimulation, the I\u03baB protein is phosphorylated and ubiquinated, and subsequent 26S proteasome-mediated degradation. I\u03baB isoform phosphorylation is stimulus specific, for example I\u03baB\u03b2 is only phosphorylated by certain stimuli including LPS and IL-1\u03b2, whereas I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation is triggered by most NF-\u03baB activators. This level of control is also thought to impact on the cell type specificity and kinetics of the response, which in turn can influence the duration of transcription.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 626, "end": 650, "text": "Siebenlist et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nuclear factor-\u03baB signalling and the Rel protein family"}, {"text": "I\u03baB phosphorylation and activation of Rel proteins can occur via the classical (canonical) or alternative pathway. In the classical pathway, a critical phosphorylation of the I\u03baB protein is performed by the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of at least three subunits, two catalytic subunits IKK-\u03b1/IKK-1 and IKK-\u03b2/IKK-2 and a regulatory subunit IKK-\u03b3/NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO) (Scheidereit, 1998; Karin, 1999; Courtois et al., 2001) .

This is also supported by the fact that much of the underlying inflammation in both stable, non-viral and viral or bacterial induced exacerbations involves NF-\u03baB.

Targeting IKK-\u03b2 represents a growing area of interest for academic researchers and industry alike, as a plethora of small molecule inhibitors have recently become available. As yet, there has been no clinical trials using IKK-\u03b2 inhibitors in asthma or COPD, however several inhibitors have been used in phase I and II clinical trials in other disorders, notably cancer (reviewed in Karin et al., 2004) . These compounds are widely used in research, particularly in small animal models. Currently there are at least eight small molecule inhibitors of IKK-\u03b2 available, with efficacies in cell based in vitro assays in the low micromolar range. A list of these inhibitors is presented in Table 2. IKK-\u03b2 inhibitors have been rigorously tested in cell based assay systems and show reliable anti-inflammatory activity using a range of stimuli (Birrell et al., 2005a; Ziegelbauer et al., 2005; Catley et al., 2006; Issa et al., 2006; Newton et al., 2007) . It would appear that IKK-\u03b2 inhibitors may possess a more comprehensive anti-inflammatory profile to that of GCs, for instance IL-1\u03b2 induced G-CSF release from primary ASM is virtually steroid resistant, whereas it is completely blocked by two structurally different IKK-\u03b2 inhibitors (Birrell et al., 2005a) . This is potentially very exciting, because the inflammation in COPD patients, and a sub-population of asthmatics are reportedly resistant to GC treatment.

Polyubiquinated proteins are recognised by the proteasome which de-ubiquinates, unfolds and destroys the target protein (reviewed in Nalepa et al., 2006) . The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex consisting of a proteolytic core particle, the 20S proteosome, capped on each end by two regulatory complexes. The 20S proteasome contains 3 pairs of active sites with distinct specificities termed chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and caspase-like (reviewed in Gilmore and Herscovitch, 2006) . There are several classes of reversible and irreversible proteasome inhibitors all of which target the 20S proteasome, some of which have been utilised in asthma or COPD research. Several studies have reported modulation of eosinophil function by blocking NF-\u03baB signalling using proteasome inhibitors. Eosinophils secrete a variety of potentially damaging mediators in response to pro-inflammatory-and microbial stimuli in an NF-\u03baB dependent manner (Rankin et al., 2000) . The activity of the lactocystin-derivative proteasome inhibitor PS-519 was examined in a rat model of OVA induced pulmonary eosinophilia. Intratracheal dosing of PS-519 before and after allergen exposure significantly reduced the number of eosinophils in sensitised lungs.

It is thought that the side effects could be the result of the expression of many genes and cellular processes influenced by proteasome inhibition, and this concept requires consideration before being applied to studies in asthma and COPD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 244, "end": 269, "text": "(Brightbill et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 669, "end": 690, "text": "(Karimi et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1086, "text": "Gilmore & Herscovitch, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1413, "text": "(Richardson et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Proteasome inhibitors"}, {"text": "While decoy oligonucleotides competitively bind free NF-\u03baB dimers thus preventing their interaction with cis-acting sites within promoter regions, antisense and small interfering RNA (siRNA) are nucleic acid based agents that target a specific mRNA such as NF-\u03baB and reduce the abundance of the corresponding protein. Antisense technology uses stablilised phosphothionate oligonucleotides to bind to complementary mRNA, thus blocking translation. OVA sensitised mice injected intravenously twice with a p65 antisense oligonucleotide show a significant reduction in the level of p65 protein and NF-\u03baB activation in the lung.

Once delivered, siRNA transiently silences gene expression by directing sequence-specific degradation of a target mRNA by an endogeneous RNA-induced silencing complex (Elbashir et al., 2001) . The majority of reports to date describing the use of siRNA to treat lung disease in vivo have targeted respiratory virus infections (Bitko et al., 2005) , demonstrating the general usefulness of delivering siRNA to the airway in vivo. Also, studies using cultured airway epithelial cells have demonstrated the utility of siRNA targeting p65 in reducing TNF-\u03b1 induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Primary epithelial cells transfected with p65-targeting siRNA produced less IL-6 and IL-8 in response to TNF-\u03b1, however this depended on the cells being undifferentiated at the time of transfection (Platz et al., 2005) . An alternative to using transfection to deliver siRNA to the lungs, is to use a viral delivery system. Another study has employed a recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing a p65-targeting siRNA. Using a similar cellular model to the previous study, expression of siRNA against p65 suppressed secretion of IL-8 by TNF-\u03b1-stimulated BEAS-2B cells (Pinkenburg et al., 2004) .

A large body of evidence has convincingly demonstrated a clear role for NF-\u03baB transcription factors and their signalling kinases in both the stable and exacerbation forms of either disease. These data are the sum of several lines of evidence, and are apparent in investigations using diseased tissue, animal models of disease, and in vitro culture cell systems. While the role of the NF-\u03baB pathway is clear, and methodologies to inhibit NF-\u03baB are encouraging in animal models, which molecules to specifically target and appropriate methods of their inhibition in human studies are less so. There is good evidence for small molecule inhibition methodologies, and also for the use of oligonucleotide based methodologies, including decoy oligonucleotides and siRNA. Further, carefully controlled studies in reliable animal models must be performed to address this complex issue before any form of inhibition can be tested in human studies. Which NF-\u03baB signalling molecule represents the best therapeutic target is again a perplexing question. While knowledge of each NF-\u03baB signalling molecule is expanding, researchers need to respect many variables, including cell type specificity, and which aspect of pathogenesis to inhibit (allergic versus non allergic inflammation, secreted cytokine/chemokine or non-secreted enzyme, adhesion molecule). Another important point worth considering is which end points are most important, especially in animal models. While inhibiting NF-\u03baB clearly affects a range of different end points, including allergic and non-allergic inflammation, and AHR, there does exist some heterogeneity between different models. This is a truly salient point, differential targeting of the NF-\u03baB pathway in different cell types may alter various end points and disease outcome in these animal models. It is likely that each outcome may be model dependent; hence the results of different models need to be interpreted with caution. The above points need to be thoroughly considered in future studies if NF-\u03baB is going to be a serious contender for therapeutic intervention in human disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary and concluding remarks"}, {"text": "The wealth of literature focusing on NF-\u03baB in asthma and COPD has also teased out several controversies regarding the suitability and or role of NF-\u03baB in asthma and COPD.

Secondly, there is the conundrum of why known NF-\u03baB inhibitors such as GCs work poorly in controlling exacerbations of asthma and COPD. While the answers are clearly complex, a better understanding, and better defining of each disease in human systems will be important in future studies. Also, particularly for COPD, and exacerbations of both diseases, the design of useful animal models with clinically useful end points is also required. The potential of targeting the NF-\u03baB pathway in asthma and COPD is therefore an excellent example in the study of clinical pharmacology.
