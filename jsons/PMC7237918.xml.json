The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 has been proposed as a potential factor in viral infectivity.2 Alternatively, some experimental pre-clinical data have shown that an ACE2-mediated increase in angiotensin may have some protective anti-inflammatory role in mitigating lung and myocardial injuries due to viral infections.2\n,\n3 However, this effect is likely to be small, and it is unclear whether increasing anti-inflammatory activity is harmful or beneficial in patients with COVID-19.4\n",

Unfortunately, published reports to date have not accounted for age as a confounding factor of COVID-19 outcomes among patients with coexisting hypertension and other cardiac comorbidities.2 Thus, the assumption that medical management of these conditions, including RAAS blockers, may have contributed to increased morbidity and mortality among COVID-19 patients remains unsupported.
