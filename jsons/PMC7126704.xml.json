However, these viruses are responsible for severe lower respiratory tract illness in patients presenting with comorbidities, and may be associated with the development of neurological diseases such as encephalitis [1]. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a large positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and a helical nucleocapsid. The epidemiological surveillance of Coronavirus infections is facilitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques used for routine diagnosis. In the Northern Hemisphere, Coronavirus infections have a seasonal distribution and seem to be uncommon outside the cold season running from December to May [2].",

All patients were residents of Reunion Island and none had traveled recently. All patients were admitted for respiratory failure caused by viral pneumonia, but three patients also presented with pulmonary edema and one with septic shock. The median age of patients was 71 [67;76] years. Infections occurred in elderly patients presenting with several comorbidities who were admitted for serious conditions as evidenced by a high SAPS II and PSI scores. Time between onset of clinical signs and ICU admission was short for two patients presenting with chronic disease failure. The other patients presented with influenza-like illness several days before hospitalization. Chest radiographic findings were abnormal for all patients. Biological results revealed that all patients had leukocytosis with lymphopenia. Three patients required mechanical ventilation for 4, 6, and 7 days. No patient needed a respiratory assistance with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. All patients but one were treated with empirical antibacterial drugs: spiramycin and cefotaxime or piperacillin/tazobactam. One (14%) patient died: a 79-year-old woman presenting with type 2 diabetes, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and prior exposure to traditional firewood for cooking. She was admitted for acute exacerbation and septic shock. The laboratory detected Coronavirus OC43 and Haemophilus influenzae in the respiratory specimen. She died despite six days of mechanical ventilation.",

A cross reactivity between Coronavirus (in particular SARS-CoV and OC43) must be considered when interpreting serological tests for Coronavirus\n[5]. Since the emergence in the 1990s of nucleic acid amplification-based techniques, especially PCR, the diagnosis of several viral agents causing pulmonary infections has greatly improved. The use of a multiplex PCR test for respiratory tract infection allows for a high rate of detection of etiological agents, and enables the detection of Coronavirus outbreaks [6]. Antiviral drugs are yet to be developed in the treatment of Coronavirus infections, but characterization of such severe infections in patients presenting with comorbidities or in immunocompromised patients could enhance the medical research. These outbreaks mainly occur when the temperature is low. However, Coronavirus OC43 outbreaks have been reported in tropical climates: Malaysia [7] and Brazil [8] in 2012-2013. The 2016 Southern Hemisphere's winter in Reunion Island was among the coldest of the last decade [9]. This could have induced a small increase in ICU admissions of elderly and frail patients.",
