Continuing abdominal pain associated with rebound tenderness and guarding in the right lower abdomen, prompted surgical review and emergency laparotomy. A macroscopically normal appendix was removed and no other intra-abdominal pathology was identified. General anaesthesia for surgery was induced with intravenous thiopental 350 mg and suxamethonium 100 mg, using a rapid sequence technique and cricoid pressure.

Due to a lack of beds at the UK National Adult ECMO Centre, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, the patient was referred to the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. A retrieval team was dispatched from Sweden comprising an intensivist, surgeon, perfusionist and ICU scrub nurse. ECMO was established in our ICU using a portable ECMO circuit primed with packed red cells. Access points for veno\u2013venous ECMO were obtained by the retrieval team via cannulation of the right internal jugular and right femoral vein. The institution of ECMO allowed rapid reduction in FiO2 and tolerance of a low volume, lung protection ventilatory strategy. Following a brief period of stabilization, she was air-lifted to the Karolinska Institute ECMO unit. A tracheostomy was performed the day after arrival in Sweden following which she was allowed to wake. She communicated with her family throughout ECMO treatment. After 17 days of continuous ECMO, her respiratory performance improved enough to allow conventional ventilation. On day 32 she was repatriated to our ICU on pressure support ventilation (FiO2 0.4, Pressure assist 12 cm H2O, PEEP 5 cm H2O) resulting in PaO2 16 kPa and PaCO2 4.6 kPa. She continued to improve and was successfully weaned from ventilation over the following days. The tracheostomy was decannulated on day 36 and she was discharged from ICU on day 37 and from hospital on day 45, when she was at 32 weeks of gestation.",

Zanamivir is administered by powder inhalation resulting in lower systemic concentrations and less fetal exposure compared with enterally administered oseltamivir. In the absence of respiratory co-morbidity, inhaled zanamivir should therefore be used as first line antiviral treatment in pregnancy.4 However, zanamivir may induce bronchospasm and the potential for this in a patient whose respiratory function was already critically impaired precluded its use in this case. Successful use of intravenous zanamivir (unlicensed) for H1N1 2009 disease in a non-pregnant patient has been reported.16 Solubilisation of zanamivir powder to allow nebulisation (unlicensed) is contraindicated in ventilated patients following a fatal episode thought to result from crystalline precipitation of the lactulose base causing obstruction of the ventilator.17\n",

The main problems reported are technical, relating to low flow rates at femoral access points as a result of the gravid uterus. This has been overcome by emergency delivery,24 or placement of additional venous access points.25 These complications were not encountered in this case.

These include the potential use of steroids as a primary treatment to improve outcome in severe H1N1 disease and their use in promoting fetal lung maturation in pregnant patients with concurrent H1N1 infection. Use of corticosteroids in sepsis and ARDS has a rational basis in attenuating inflammatory response. Initially promising results26 have, however, been overshadowed by studies that have failed to show improvement in outcome with steroid use, and have highlighted their potential for significant adverse effects.27, 28 Steroid use in ICU is therefore reserved for refractory cases. Corticosteroids are most likely to be used in patients with 2009 H1N1 who meet criteria for administration due to severe septic shock. Of greater concern is the possible temptation to use steroids as a primary adjuvant therapy for cases of severe H1N1. Steroids were widely used in this capacity during the global Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Retrospective data analysis from the outbreak failed to show any benefit with steroid treatment and indicate possible harm as a result of their use.29 Despite this there is already one report of 2009 H1N1 pneumonitis treated successfully with zanamivir and high-dose corticosteroids.16 WHO guidelines do not recommend high-dose steroids in the treatment of H1N1 2009 influenza.30\n",
