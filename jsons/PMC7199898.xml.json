Pleconaril use was associated with significant reductions in symptom severity scores and the frequency of recovery of picornaviruses within 1 day after initiation of therapy.

This prolonged recovery of virus is consistent with earlier data from natural and experimentally induced rhinovirus infections [21, 22], but it raises the issue of emergence of drug-resistant variants. In the current studies, viruses with reduced susceptibility to pleconaril (\u226410-fold change from baseline value) were recovered during or after therapy from \u223c10% of patients who received pleconaril. However, subgroup analyses indicate that clinical benefit for these participants was as good as or better than that for pleconaril recipients with no reduction in virus susceptibility to the drug (unpublished data).

In that study, an excess of mild or moderate menstrual disorders (most commonly breakthrough bleeding or spotting) was reported from women taking oral contraceptives and pleconaril. Subsequent investigations revealed that pleconaril induces hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A enzymes. Pleconaril reduced the area under the curve of plasma levels of ethinyl estradiol by 34% following single-dose administration (G. Rhodes, personal communication). Retrospective review of all randomized, placebo-controlled trials in which pleconaril was administered for 5\u20137 days revealed that menstrual irregularities were reported by 3.5% of 310 pleconaril-treated women who were using oral contraceptives and by none of 291 placebo-treated women. None of the menstrual irregularities led to discontinuation of treatment. Additional studies are ongoing to better characterize the magnitude and duration of cytochrome P-450 3A induction and to determine the clinical significance for coadministration of pleconaril with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A.",
