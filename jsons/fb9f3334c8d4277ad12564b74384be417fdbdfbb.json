These viruses include important human and animal pathogens, such as influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, corona, noro, rota, and DNA tumor viruses. Attachment to sialic acid is mediated by receptor binding proteins that are constituents of viral envelopes or exposed at the surface of nonenveloped viruses. Some of these viruses are also equipped with a neuraminidase or a sialyl-O-acetyl-esterase. These receptor-destroying enzymes promote virus release from infected cells and neutralize sialic acid-containing soluble proteins interfering with cell surface binding of the virus. Variations in the receptor specificity are important determinants for host range, tissue tropism, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of these viruses.",

Hirst and McClelland and Hare discovered that influenza virus is able to hemagglutinate and that adsorbed virus is eluted from erythrocytes on incubation at 37 C, indicating an enzymatic destruction of a receptor substance on the cells [1, 2] . When a similar enzymatic activity was subsequently detected in Vibrio cholerae cultures, the term \"receptor-destroying enzyme\" was introduced [3] . The substance released by the viral enzyme from soluble hemagglutination inhibitors was initially characterized as a carbohydrate of low molecular weight [4] and then identified in crystalline form as N-acetyl-Dneuraminic acid [5] . Thus, it was clear that the receptor determinant of influenza virus was sialic acid and that the viral enzyme was a neuraminidase. Furthermore, for the first time an important biological function of sialic acid had been identified.",

            "text": "HA initiates infection by binding to cell surface receptors and by inducing fusion between viral and cellular membranes. HA is integrated in the virus envelope as a type I membrane protein. The ectodomain of HA represents 90% of the polypeptide chain. The residual 10% of the HA sequence accounts for the transmembrane domain and the cytosolic domain. HA is synthesized as a precursor molecule HA0 (75 kDa) which assembles to homotrimers. HA0 is N-glycosylated, palmitoylated, and proteolytically cleaved by host enzymes. The amino-terminal cleavage fragment HA1 (50 kDa) contains the receptor binding site and the carboxy-terminal fragment HA2 (25 kDa) is membrane anchored and responsible for fusion (reviewed in [14] ). The receptor determinant of influenza A and B viruses is sialic acid, mostly N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). The structures of complexes of HA of influenza A and B viruses with sialyloligosaccharides were determined by X-ray crystallography (reviewed in [15, 16] ). The sialic acid-binding site is a shallow pocket located on the globular head of HA (Fig. 1 ). Virus binding depends not only on HA affinity for the terminal sialic acid residues, but also on the structure of the underlying oligosaccharide and protein or lipid moieties of the receptors, as well as on the abundance and accessibility of receptors on the cell surface. Because of this complex mode of binding, the receptor-binding properties of influenza viruses can be affected by amino acid substitutions inside the sialic acid-binding pocket, on the pocket rim, and by distant mutations resulting in altered glycosylation or altered electrostatic charge of the globular head of HA (reviewed in [17] ). In natural glycoconjugates, sialic acids are \u03b12-3or \u03b12-6-linked to Gal and GalNAc, \u03b12-6-linked to GlcNAc, or \u03b12-8-linked to the second Sia residue. Influenza viruses generally do not bind to \u03b12-8-linked",

            "text": "Differences in receptor-binding specificity of influenza viruses can contribute to viral host range restriction. Thus, human influenza viruses preferentially bind to \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids (Neu5Ac\u03b12-6Gal), whereas avian influenza viruses preferentially recognize Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal [18] [19] [20] . These preferences are matched by predominant expression of Neu5Ac\u03b12-6Gal on epithelial cells in the human airway epithelium and by abundance of Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal on epithelial cells in the intestinal and respiratory tract of birds [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The receptor-binding specificity of human and avian influenza viruses suggests that avian viruses need to acquire the ability to recognize human-type receptors to be able to replicate efficiently and transmit in humans. Indeed, the earliest isolates of the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemics possessed HA that, although of avian origin, recognized human-type receptors (reviewed in [27, 28] ). In light of these findings, the infection of humans with highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses seemed to be surprising as H5N1 viruses isolated from infected individuals preferentially recognize Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal [29] [30] [31] . Studies on human and avian virus infection in differentiated cultures of human airway epithelial cells indicated, however, that some cells in the human airway epithelium express sufficient amounts of receptors to allow infection with avian viruses and that receptor specificity determines the viral cell tropism in the epithelium. Early in infection, human viruses preferentially infected non-ciliated cells, whereas avian viruses mainly infected ciliated cells [32] . Other groups studied expression of viral receptors in human biopsies and archival tissues using lectins Sambucus nigra agglutinin, Maackia amurensis agglutinins I and II, and human and avian influenza viruses as molecular probes M. Matrosovich et al. [26, [33] [34] [35] [36] . The results obtained in these studies suggest that paucity of receptors for avian viruses in the upper respiratory tract in humans is one of the factors preventing efficient human-to-human transmission. This concept is supported by recent studies showing that H5N1 mutants binding to \u03b12-6 linked sialic acid are transmitted between ferrets through the air [37, 38] . Because pigs support replication of both avian and human viruses, they were considered to be a plausible intermediate host for the generation of human pandemic strains by gene reassortment (reviewed in [39] ). This theory was further supported by the finding that both 3-linked and 6-linked sialic acid moieties were detected by staining on the histological sections of pig tracheal epithelium [23] . All early studies on swine influenza viruses were done using viruses that were grown in embryonated chicken eggs. However, similar to human influenza viruses, swine viruses appear to change their receptor specificity in eggs. Indeed, non-egg-adapted classical swine influenza viruses that were isolated and propagated solely in MDCK cells displayed a strict preference for 6-linked sialic acids and did not bind to 3-linked sialic acids [40] . This binding pattern is typical for non-egg-adapted human influenza viruses, and it is in discordance with the previously described ability of egg-adapted swine influenza viruses to recognize Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal [19, 23] . Thus, the receptor specificity of the pig viruses may be even closer to that of human viruses than originally thought. This notion agrees with recent data on a close similarity in the distribution of sialic acid receptors in the respiratory tract of pigs and humans [24, 26, 41] .",

In some of these studies the virus was found to bind exclusively to \u03b12-6-linked sialyl sequences [42] [43] [44] [45] , whereas in another study using a different microarray some binding to probes containing \u03b12-3-linkages was also observed [46] . These studies showed also that the H1N1/2009 pandemic virus displayed the same binding profile as its putative swine precursors. The results indicate that no major change in receptor-binding specificity of HA was required for the emergent pandemic virus to acquire human-like characteristics and become established in the human population. Interestingly, mutations in the receptor-binding site of the HA of H1N1/2009 viruses have been detected sporadically, and the D222G substitution has been associated with severe or fatal disease [47, 48] . Compared to the parental virus, the D222G mutant virus displayed enhanced binding to \u03b12-3-linked sugars [45, 49] , infected a higher proportion of ciliated cells in cultures of human airway epithelium [49] , and showed an altered pattern of attachment to human respiratory tissues in vitro, in particular increased binding to macrophages and type II pneumocytes in the alveoli [50] . These results suggested that the association of the D222G mutation with severe disease in humans reflects receptor-mediated alteration of the cell tropism of the mutant in human respiratory epithelium with enhanced replication in the lower respiratory tract.",

The first evidence against this theory was obtained in a study showing that H5N1 viruses isolated in Hong Kong in 1997 from Sialic Acid Receptors of Viruses poultry and humans had a lower receptor binding affinity and a lower neuraminidase activity than closely related viruses of aquatic birds [30] . Subsequent detailed receptor-binding studies revealed that influenza viruses adapted to ducks, gulls, and land-based gallinaceous poultry differ in their ability to recognize the sub-terminal saccharides of Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal-terminated receptors (reviewed in [28, 52] ). In particular, duck viruses preferentially bind to receptors with type 1 and type 3 oligosaccharide sequences, such as Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc and Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc, and viruses isolated from gulls show high-avidity binding to fucosylated sialyloligosaccharides Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4 (Fuc\u03b11-3)GlcNAc and Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3(Fuc\u03b11-4)GlcNAc. In contrast, poultry-adapted viruses preferentially bind to receptors with type 2 sequences, such as Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc, with particularly strong binding to the corresponding sulfated analogues Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4(6-O-HSO 3 )GlcNAc and Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4(Fuc\u03b11-3)(6-O-HSO 3 )GlcNAc. Furthermore, some viruses of the Eurasian lineage of H9N2 poultry viruses bind to Neu5Ac\u03b12-6Gal terminated sialyloligosaccharides [28] . Thus it seems that influenza viruses circulating in different birds can have different receptor specificity owing to distinctions between the sialic acid receptors in these avian species.",

Each monomer consists of a cytoplasmic tail six amino acids in length, a stem region varying in length between 19 and 45 amino acids, and a carboxy-terminal globular head [53, 54] . The monomers are linked to dimers by disulfide bridges in the stalk region. The available evidence indicates that the neuraminidase has several functions in the life cycle of influenza virus. It was Burnet who proposed more than 60 years ago that the RDE allows the virus to penetrate the mucus layer coating the respiratory epithelium and thus to infect its target cells [3] . This concept has recently been shown to be correct when it was found that the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir prevented initiation of infection of human tracheo-bronchial cell cultures [55] . The second function of the neuraminidase is at the end of the life cycle where it promotes virus release and prevents clumping of virions by removing receptors from the cell surface and viral glycoproteins, respectively [56] .",

This study also revealed that the hemadsorption activity of the NAs of early human isolates of the pandemics of 1918 and 1957 was reduced or completely absent.

The enzyme belongs to the class of serine hydrolases with a catalytic triad formed by residues S57, D352, and H355 [69, [71] [72] [73] . The biological importance of the acetylesterase activity of HEF is believed to be similar to that of the neuraminidase of influenza A virus, i.e., facilitating virus spread by inactivation of potential receptor determinants from the surface of the infected cells and from the viral surface. In the initial stage of the infection cycle, the receptor-destroying enzyme may facilitate virus entry, e.g., by enabling virus to penetrate the mucus layer covering the respiratory epithelium [74] . In the late stage of the growth cycle, inactivation of receptor determinants may promote release of viruses from the infected cell and may prevent the formation of virus aggregates [75] . Supporting evidence has been provided by studies involving enzyme inhibitors, sialic acid analogues, and de-and resialylation experiments [73, 76, 77] .",

According to a current proposal to the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses, they are classified within the subfamily Coronavirinae which comprises four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus. The diversity of coronaviruses is also evident in the sialic acid binding activity. Some members of the Betacoronavirus genus, e.g., bovine coronavirus (BCoV), recognize O-acetylated sialic acids and contain an acetylesterase that functions as a receptor-destroying enzyme. On the other hand, some alpha-and gammacoronaviruses lack a comparable enzyme and have a preference for N-acetyl-or N-glycolylneuraminic acid, the best studied examples being transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). In addition to the above-mentioned viruses, both alpha-and gammacoronaviruses also include members that lack any sialic acid binding activity, e.g., SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E. In the following, the sialic acid binding activities of BCoV, TGEV, and IBV will be described in more detail.",

When polarized epithelial cells such as MDCK I cells were analyzed for susceptibility to infection, BCoV was found to infect the cells via the apical but not via the basolateral side of the membrane [103, 104] . The inability of BCoV to infect MDCK I cells via the basolateral plasma membrane may reflect that the major glycoprotein recognized by BCoV, a mucin-like glycoprotein of 40 kDa, is predominantly present in the apical membrane domain [105] . An alternative explanation is that BCoV requires an additional receptor for initiation of infection, which is present only on the apical membrane.

Infections are especially severe in piglets up to two weeks of age which usually die unless they are protected by maternal antibodies. When Noda and co-workers [111, 112] first described the ability of TGEV to agglutinate erythrocytes, the virus appeared to contain a weak hemagglutinin. This is probably related to the absence of a receptordestroying enzyme that may remove competitive inhibitors from the viral surface.",

In this way it was shown that the HA-activity of TGEV was due to a sialic acid-binding activity with a preference for \u03b12-3-linked N-glycolylneuraminic acid [104, 113] . The sialic acid binding activity of TGEV is located in the amino-terminal portion of the surface glycoprotein S between amino acids 20 and 244. Evidence is based on the hemagglutination-inhibiting effect of monoclonal antibodies and on the analysis of mutant proteins with one or more amino acid exchanges [104, 113] . Interestingly, all mutants that had lost hemagglutinating activity were strongly reduced in their enteropathogenic effect, indicating that the sialic acid binding activity is an important factor for the enteropathogenicity of TGEV [113] [114] [115] .",

However, in binding assays the amount of parental virus attached to sialic acids on the cell surface was increased sixfold compared to mutant virus that was only able to bind to pAPN [120] . Recent results demonstrated that binding to sialic acids is dispensable for infection of cultured cells, when a conventional adsorption time is applied, i.e., 60 min. However, when the adsorption time is reduced to 5 min, infection becomes sialic acid-dependent, as indicated by the effect of pretreatment of cells with neuraminidase, which resulted in a more than 80% reduction of infectivity. This result indicates that the sialic acid binding activity can facilitate infection under unfavorable conditions [121] and therefore may be necessary for infection of the intestine.",

The enzyme of bovine torovirus releases the O-acetyl group from position C-9 of sialic acid and accepts as a substrate both Neu5,9Ac 2 and N-acetyl-7(8),9-O-acetylneuraminic acid; this specificity resembles those that have been reported for the HEF protein of influenza C virus and for the HE proteins of several coronaviruses [100] . By contrast, the HE protein of porcine torovirus has a narrower specificity, accepting Neu5,9Ac 2 but not Neu5,7(8),9Ac 3 as a substrate [100] . Analysis of the crystal structure revealed that the torovirus HE proteins have an esterase domain similar to those of the coronavirus HE and influenza C virus HEF proteins [130] ; on the other hand, the sialic acid binding site is unique.

Virus binding to the macrophage surface is partially neuraminidase-sensitive and gangliosidedependent [155] .

Trypsin cleaves the C-terminal from the N-terminal domain of VP4, giving rise to VP5 and VP8, respectively, both of which remain associated with the virion. X-Ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy of VP8 alone and complexed with 2-0methyl-\u03b1-D-N-acetyl neuraminic acid revealed that the VP8 core is a globular domain of an 11-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sandwich with the sialic acid binding site located in an open-ended, shallow groove [167, 168] . The concept that rotaviruses attach to sialic acid is supported by the observation that binding of some strains to cells is abolished by neuraminidase treatment [169, 170] . In contrast, binding of many other strains is neuraminidase insensitive [171] , but it is now clear that these viruses also use sialic acid, yet in a form resistant to neuraminidase treatment [172, 173] . Comparison of the crystal structures of VP8 of neuraminidase-sensitive and neuraminidase-insensitive strains revealed that they were very similar, differing only by the size of the sialic acid binding groove that was slightly wider with the neuraminidase-insensitive strain [174] .",

The VP5 domain then interacts with \u03b12\u03b21 integrin. Finally, several additional interactions take place, involving VP5, VP7, integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1x\u03b22, and probably other cellular proteins [175] . Compatible with this concept is the observation that rotavirus binding to sialic acid is characterized by broad specificity and low affinity, suggesting that it mediates initial cell attachment prior to other interactions that determine host range and cell type specificity [176] .",

Employing reconstituted erythrocytes with defined sialic acid moieties they found that some strains specifically bound to \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid, whereas others also recognized branched \u03b12-6-linkages [185] [186] [187] . More recently, gangliosides GD1a and GT1b were identified as receptors in sucrose gradient floatation assays [188] . Crystallographic analysis has shown that a shallow groove composed of several loops of VP1 serves as the sialic acid binding site [184, 189] . The structural analysis also showed that the receptor pocket specifically accommodates a Neu5Ac\u03b12-3-Gal motif unbranched at the Gal position [183] which is compatible with the data obtained in the binding studies employing erythrocytes [186] and gangliosides [188] . MPyV also uses \u03b14\u03b21 integrin as receptor [190] which appears to be mediated by an LDV integrin binding groove deep within VP1. This suggests that, after attachment to sialic acid, the virus has to undergo a conformational change that allows binding to integrin as a second step in the entry process [8] . Evidence has also been obtained that binding to gangliosides promotes virus entry via caveolin-mediated endocytosis [191, 192] .",

BkPyV binds only to \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid [198] , and floatation assays have shown that gangliosides GD1b and GT1b serve as receptors [199] . GT1b was also identified as a receptor of MCPyV, and the observation that GD1a and GD1b did not show this function suggests that both the \u03b12-3-linked and the \u03b12-8-linked sialic acid of GT1b are required [200] .",

These are the minute virus of mice in the Parvovirus genus and some adeno associated viruses (AAVs) in the Densovirus genus. AAVs are non-pathogenic agents that depend on adenoviruses for replication. Because of their inability to induce productive infection in the absence of a helper virus, AAVs are promising vectors in gene therapy.",
