Current studies of bat lyssavirus ecology and evolution in Africa are hampered by resourcelimited laboratories and the requirement for large volumes of sera for routine virus neutralising antibody (VNAb) tests.

Also, PNAs have been shown to aid the identification of more potent and broader cross-neutralising MAbs than has been possible using other neutralisation assays (Corti et al., 2010) . The strong correlation (0.83) and the high sensitivity/specificity (95/93%) between LBV PNA and mFAVN VNAb titres observed in this study further validates PNA as a useful alternative to existing serological assays. Similar PNAs are used widely in influenza research to answer important epidemiological and biological questions with equally accurate results as live virus assays (Alberini et al., 2009; Garcia et al., 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 238, "text": "(Naldini et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 239, "end": 261, "text": "Zufferey et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 345, "end": 367, "text": "(Aljofan et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 368, "end": 387, "text": "Parry et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 388, "end": 404, "text": "Su et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 427, "end": 450, "text": "(Temperton et al., 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 451, "end": 476, "text": "(Temperton et al., , 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 477, "end": 497, "text": "Wright et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 522, "end": 542, "text": "(Szecsi et al., 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 543, "end": 565, "text": "(Szecsi et al., , 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 566, "end": 584, "text": "Yang et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 794, "end": 814, "text": "(Corti et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1218, "text": "(Alberini et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1239, "text": "Garcia et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We have further added to the flexibility of the lyssavirus PNA scaffold by including a multiplex platform that could prove valuable for serosurveillance in bats. By incorporating different luciferase reporter genes in the viral genome and different envelope glycoproteins on the viral membrane of separate pseudotype preparations it is now possible to detect VNAb titres to two viruses in one serum dilution. This holds great promise for bat serology studies where the scales of investigations are usually limited by the volume of serum collected. With this multiplex PNA it is possible to use \u226410 \u03bcl of sera to obtain VNAb titres to two viruses, twice as much information than with the standard PNA. We postulate that it is possible to increase this capacity further by including pseudotyped viruses encoding fluorescent reporter genes, such as GFP or RFP, as these signals could be read prior to cell lysis for the luciferase measurements. It would then theoretically be possible to undertake serosurveillance for many highly pathogenic viruses that have been successfully pseudotyped, for example, filoviruses, corona-viruses, henipaviruses and other lyssaviruses, in low containment laboratories using one serum dilution series and a tiny volume of serum compared with that required for conventional assays.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, we observed a similar seroprevalence of LBV and MOKV antibodies in E. helvum as had been reported by other African serologic studies (Hayman et al., 2008a; Kuzmin et al., 2008a) and a low seroprevalence of WCBV in Ghanaian E. helvum. The high percentage of LBV serum positive bats (56%), approximately 2 years after Hayman et al. (2008a) first detected anti-LBV antibodies in E. helvum in Ghana, provide support for our hypothesis that LBV is endemic within this bat population. It is currently unknown whether these seropositive animals have ever been infectious and recovered from a neurological infection or whether the seropositivity is evidence of peripheral infection that has been prevented from reaching the nervous system by the host's immune response. In addition, the difficulties of aging adult wild animals and the problems of undertaking capture-mark-recapture studies in such large populations of flying wild animals currently limit our knowledge regarding age-specific seroprevalence and antibody titre decay rates in this virus-host system. Until these data are available further conclusions regarding virus infection dynamics within this population will be limited, whether for lyssaviruses or other viral infections against which antibodies have been detected in E. helvum (Hayman et al., 2008b; Hayman et al., 2010) . However, our results suggest that the risk to humans and domestic animals may be present wherever this species occurs in close proximity to them, especially given that they are a food source across much of Africa (Mickleburgh et al., 2009) . A small proportion (\u226411%) of the bat serum neutralised more than one of the lyssaviruses which is notable. It is probable that some of the ptMOKV neutralisation observed is due to cross-reaction with LBV VNAb as this has been reported previously from this species in Kenya and Nigeria (Dzikwi et al., 2010; Kuzmin et al., 2008a) . However, we detected four serum samples which neutralised ptMOKV but not ptLBV and 11 with a higher VNAb titre against ptMOKV than ptLBV. There are different possible explanations for these data. The variable response individuals show heterologous antigens might explain the variation shown with these animals (Kuzmin et al., 2008a; Smith et al., 2004) . The dynamic nature of these biological tests might also affect the VNAb titre, with testto-test variation being possible. Also, at the genomic level the domains containing the major immuno-dominant epitopes might appear different but when folded the antigenic sites might adopt similar conformations. Alternatively, these data might show true evidence of previous exposure to MOKV, although we believe that the variable immune response to heterologous antigen is the most likely reason for these results, particularly given the degree of cross-neutralisation in this and previous studies (Dzikwi et al., 2010; Kuzmin et al., 2008a) . It is also interesting to note one strong (1:320) and one weak (1:8) VNAb titre were recorded against ptWCBV for different serum samples. Support for crossneutralisation as the cause of such observations is provided by the individual with the 1:320 VNAb titre having a very high titre against ptLBV (1:1280), and ptMOKV (1:640), perhaps demonstrating that a strong immune response to LBV can lead to neutralisation of other lyssaviruses. That this represents a seroprevalence of 1% in our sampled group of bats, far below what has been recorded for WCBV in other studies, suggests that even though the same serum samples did not neutralise ptCVS-11, these results do not constitute convincing evidence for the presence of WCBV circulating in Ghanaian bats. Therefore, analysis of our results with those of previous studies suggests possible species specificity for certain bat lyssaviruses. While LBV RNA and antibodies have been detected in a different bat species (Dzikwi et al., 2010; Hayman et al., 2008a; Kuzmin et al., 2008a) , MOKV infection has never been reported in bats and WCBV has only been isolated in Miniopterus species (Botvinkin et al., 2003; Kuzmin et al., 2008b) . Evidence of LBV and WCBV infection has been reported within the same cave colony but in different bat species (Kuzmin et al., 2008a,b) . This may suggest a restricted host range for certain lyssaviruses, possibly due to cellular, behavioural, or ecological restrictions that may have evolved during the co-evolution of the host and virus. However, with more intensive, far reaching virological studies, MOKV and WCBV might be isolated from bats or more than one species respectively. Therefore, seroprevalence studies are needed to elucidate the true distribution of LBV, MOKV and WCBV and we propose the multiplexed PNA we describe will substantially improve surveillance capabilities. Given our studies also provide evidence of endemic circulation of LBV within bat populations in urban centres, further studies are necessary in order to understand both virus dynamics at the population level and species specificity at the cellular level.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 170, "text": "(Hayman et al., 2008a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 171, "end": 192, "text": "Kuzmin et al., 2008a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 331, "end": 352, "text": "Hayman et al.
