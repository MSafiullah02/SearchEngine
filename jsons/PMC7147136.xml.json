The focus of models available to date differs from those we typically see (in focussing on the spread over time rather than the total impact), but they are not far removed from the models regularly published in HE, especially where infectious diseases are involved [1]. However, as a whole, we do seem to compare favourably as a discipline in two areas: transparency and sensitivity analysis.",

Although it may not always be possible to perfectly recreate models from reported data, we can get fairly close [2]. This has not been the case for many of the COVID-19 models released to date. They may have been written up under time pressure (and thus are not necessarily generalisable to the models built by entire fields), but it is hard to critique a model properly without seeing the inputs used. Similarly, model and data structures are vitally important and can determine much of the shape of the final results.",

As modellers, we know that some inputs are massively influential on results, and rarely are we certain of their true values. Given this uncertainty, it is rare to find HE work without extensive sensitivity analysis to consider both the parameter and the structural uncertainties\u2014more often than not accounting for the correlation between parameters. Of the epidemiological models reported to date, too few have taken such a rigorous approach\u2014in many cases relying on point estimates with little consideration of \u2018other states of the world\u2019. Where outputs are similar, probabilistic estimates may be approximated by deterministic runs for expediency (for example, in sensitivity analysis). However, even then, for the main results the underlying uncertainty should be propagated through models, especially where so many unknowns exist [3].",

To reflect uncertainty, the UK government scientific advisors have stated not only estimates but also their confidence in their estimates of effect sizes [5]. This approach was taken from another high-profile modelling effort of even greater importance than COVID-19\u2014that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [6].",

If the IPCC provides estimates or statements, they use a standardised language: an outcome stated to be \u2018very likely\u2019 in all cases will mean it is predicted to happen with 90\u2013100% probability. The IPCC work then goes further by discussing the degree of agreement in the evidence (low, medium or high) and the quality of evidence (limited, medium or robust) [7]. Standardisation of an approach to describing uncertainty in HE would avoid misinterpretation, both within and outside our discipline, using a common currency. As a starting point, we could do a lot worse than adopting the excellent work of the IPCC \u2013 as has been done for COVID-19 scientific advice.",

Over the past weeks, terminology from other areas such as R0 (the basic reproduction number of a disease) and \u2018exponential growth\u2019 have made their way into common parlance. However, HE has not (for whatever reason) managed to convey the concept of opportunity cost. Sadly, media discussions on the level of \u2018lockdown\u2019 required around the world present a false dichotomy between lives and \u2018the economy\u2019, generally defined as gross domestic product. As a field, we know that trade-offs are regularly made between health and wealth\u2014ultimately because of the problem of scarce resources. More concerning is the (near absent) discussion around the opportunity cost of the policies pursued in terms of health impact. This applies to the direct effects of postponing usual care and enforcing isolation on households (with health impacts) but also indirectly the health gains that could be achieved with more funding in less exceptional times. Some notable examples of prioritisation are coming to light [8], but once HE models have been produced we will see estimates of cost per life-year (potentially quality adjusted), which will lay bare the choices that have been made. If decisions are shown to be cost effective, this will seemingly be by accident as opposed to by design.",

Some of these are excellent [9], but many contain notable flaws and/or unstated limitations and would be unlikely to be accepted for publication in their existing format\u2014underlining the importance of peer review as quality control. There have been examples of good science done quickly [10], but\u2014for the most part (as would be expected)\u2014publication incorporating peer review cannot keep up. In COVID-19, this can be explained by how quickly the virus and containment measures have emerged, but it is not explainable in our field\u2014in what have been less urgent times.",

Simpler processes for submission for authors, a charter of minimum standards for journals to adhere to (in review time, decision times, and time to online publication), and recognition for reviewers (whatever appropriate form that may take).

But does this also extend to saving unidentifiable individuals from identifiable diseases, i.e. from COVID-19? If so, this has implications for health technology assessment\u2014every disease assessed becomes \u2018special\u2019 by virtue of having a spotlight shone on it. Since the original work on this topic was produced, we have also had the introduction of the 24-h news cycle and, especially, social media.
