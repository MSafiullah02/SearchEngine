Such activities could take place through participation in science and technology parks, which create a formal site where firms (normally high-tech firms) can locate and interact with the university. These parks provide a seed bed for the development of multiple new ventures and can thus contribute to regional cluster development and employment. The infrastructure in turn contributes to the research capability of the university by attracting highly skilled individuals and technological resources to the region.",

The creation of these new entrepreneurial ventures transfers technology from the lab to market, thus exploiting intellectual property and generating regional employment. Finally, the university can award licenses for use of its patented innovations. The original act of patenting the innovation documents the knowledge contribution of the university and allows the controlled transfer of the intellectual property to selected industrial partners, who can exploit the innovation for competitive advantage and wealth generation. Such licensing can both support existing firms and favour the creation of new entrepreneurial activities (Chang et al. 2009; O\u2019Shea et al. 2008; Wright et al. 2006; Murray 2004; Shane 2004a, b; Di Gregorio and Shane 2003).",

Large domestic and foreign corporations, which benefit from strong state backing, have traditionally carried out the bulk of Singapore\u2019s innovation and commercialisation activities. For example for many years, the Economic Development Board has offered incentives to large foreign corporations to either relocate or build their regional R&D centres in Singapore. As a result, foreign corporations and large local enterprises accounted for 85.7 % of industry R&D expenditure from 2002 to 2010.

The NUS also provides advisory services for students to assist them in identifying the paths that will develop the necessary knowledge, skills and contacts for their entrepreneurial initiatives. The NUS Overseas College offers potential entrepreneurs the possibility to broaden their contacts through continuous cooperation and learning in the field, working alongside actors who have created successful start-ups both in Singapore and in other nations. In this way, the NUS offers its student entrepreneurs the possibility of developing not only specialised scientific knowledge, but also the knowledge of business fundamentals necessary for development of their own activities. The NUS has also created Start-Up@Singapore (S@S), an instrument for stimulation and participation in development of territorial start-ups. Start-Up@Singapore stimulates development of innovative ideas and encourages healthy competition between potential entrepreneurs by organising \u201cglobal business plan\u201d competitions that offer the winners financing to continue with their innovative activity. As of 2012, the S@S competition was in its 14th edition, representing a total of more than 3,500 teams and 10,000 individual participants, and had helped to spin off more than 90 start-ups. These have included award-winning businesses such as tenCube, FriarTuck, PerceptiveI, World Indigo, PurpleAce and Quantagen.

One of the specificities of Lynk is its scientific planning approach, using SM@RT\u2122 Drug Design, Receptomics\u2122 and PharmaGlue\u2122 technologies, as well as specific knowledge in proteomics. With this approach, Lynk has accelerated and improved efficiencies in the drug discovery process, shortening the lead stages from years to months. One of Lynk\u2019s first products was Biolyn\u2122 shampoo, a hair care product based on natural materials, with active ingredients formulated using bio-transformed phyto-therapeutic agents, vitamins and minerals. The product maintains healthy hair and prevents hair loss and thinning. Lynk Biotechnologies is the brainchild of Lee Chee Wee, who developed the technological innovations for the founding of Lynk through his role as a research professor at NUS. Lynk has successfully commercialised these technologies and made them available to the public.\nAyoxxA Biosystems\nAyoxxA began life in 2008 as a research project to apply parallel biomolecular microarray systems for simultaneous detection of multiple protein biomarkers, in a single step. In the company\u2019s words, the innovation represents \u201cFerrari-level horsepower\u201d in protein analysis, allowing hundreds of diseases, from infectious types to cancer, to be detected from a single blood sample. The new technology is a significant improvement over previous diagnostic technologies, which can detect only a handful of diseases in a single test run. The end results is faster diagnosis, meaning faster treatment for the patient.The research team, led by Dieter Trau of the faculty of engineering, wanted to develop a product permitting cost-effective manufacturing. Their innovative work led to the incorporation of AyoxxA in 2010, with Professor Trau holding the position of Chief Scientific Officer and another team member, Dr. Andreas Schmidt, serving as CEO. The spin-off company is developing NUS\u2019s proprietary technology as a platform to allow simultaneous, precise and cost-effective protein analysis from minute samples.\nClearbridge BioMedics, NanoMedics and VitalSigns\nJohnson Chen is a \u201cserial entrepreneur\u201d, having launched three healthcare start-ups based on technologies licensed from the NUS. The series of company set-ups started when Mr. Chen met up with Lim Chwee Teck, a friend from past years at Cambridge, then a professor in the NUS departments of mechanical engineering and bioengineering, who was developing a technology that trapped tumour cells circulating in blood. Realising the commercial potential of the technology, the two friends spun it off as Clearbridge BioMedics in 2009. They translated the lab prototype into a commercial product and launched it as the ClearCell\u2122 system, which detects, isolates and retrieves intact circulating tumour cells. As of 2011, ClearCell\u2122 was involved in global marketing to the research community, while the company turned its focus to developing a new generation of the system for clinical applications.Recognising that the NUS held further technologies with commercial interest, Mr. Chen then licensed another of Prof Lim\u2019s innovations: a bio-resorbable and biocompatible nanofibre with good mechanical, physical and chemical properties. Clearbridge NanoMedics was set up to commercialise the technology for cosmetic and injury management applications. NUS then also introduced Johnson to an ultra-low powered electrocardiogram (ECG) chip, invented by Lian Yong, a professor of electrical and computer engineering. This let to establishment of Clearbridge VitalSigns, which is developing the NUS technology as CardioLeaf\u00ae, a fully-integrated 3-Lead ECG monitor, targeting both medical and fitness applications.\nSource NUS Enterprise organisational website\n",

The same technology is also saving the lives of the horseshoe crab, an endangered species in many of its global habitats. The husband-wife team of professors Ho Bow and Ding Jeak Ling, respectively from the departments of microbiology and biological sciences, developed the original research, which has become one of the NUS\u2019s most successfully commercialised technologies.Pharmaceutical and medical device companies routinely use horseshoe-crab blood to ensure medication and equipment are free from bacterial endotoxins. This is possible due to an enzyme in the crab\u2019s blood, Factor C, which triggers the clotting process when in contact with bacterial endotoxins. However collecting horseshoe crab blood is a time-consuming and costly process. Professors Ding and Ho developed a method for laboratory production of Factor C, using a recombinant DNA-based system to clone the original enzyme. Not only does the clone succeed in reacting with endotoxins, and at very low concentrations, it also results as more stable and chemically-consistent than the natural form. With the support of the NUS Industry Liaison Office, this ground-breaking technology was licensed for production and introduced for global use. Lonza, the international life-sciences leader, has since incorporated the NUS technology into its endotoxin detection kits and online endotoxin monitoring systems. Another US-based company, BioDtech Inc., has applied related technologies in development of products for removal of bacterial endotoxins from pharmaceuticals and fluids.\nRapid\n-\nassay diagnostic kits for detection of parasitic diseases\nMalaria and dengue fever are mosquito-borne tropical diseases that affect millions of people, while malaria kills about three million people per year. Rapid, accurate diagnosis is paramount for timely emergency response, treatment and containment. The standard test for the malarial plasmodium parasite is time-consuming, laborious, and can produce false negatives. Testing for dengue fever takes up to 8 days and can also deliver inaccurate results. However a medical-diagnostics company, using breakthrough molecular technology from the NUS, has developed rapid-assay test kits that detects the parasites in a matter of hours.NUS researchers Ursula Kara, Robert Ting, Jill Tham, James Nelson and Theresa Tan discovered and patented the unique nucleic acid diagnostic primers for the parasitic vectors over a ten-year period, finally announcing the technology in 1998. A primer is a short strand of DNA/RNA that serves in the formation of longer strands. Using a single drop of blood, the highly sensitive polymerase chain-reaction technology can distinguish between different plasmodium species within 3 h. The dengue fever kit can detect the virus within three to 5 days after it first appears in the bloodstream, compared to the usual 8 days for standard immunodiagnostic methods. Detection enables earlier medical attention, which can be critical for preventing serious complications such as dengue haemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. The NUS has licensed the technology to Veredus Laboratories, which is manufacturing and selling several different diagnostic kits. Singapore\u2019s National University Hospital has used the dengue fever kit for more than 3 years as a routine diagnostic tool. In addition, Veredus has produced the world\u2019s first validated commercial avian flu diagnostic kit, which cuts the time for accurate detection of the H5N1 virus from 7 days to as little as two. As of 2013, the company was also developing kits for encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, chicken pox and SARS.\nAnti\n-\nrestenosis drug\nRestenosis is a recurring occurrence of narrowing of the arteries. A new drug with a novel mechanism for preventing the condition was first discovered by Sim Meng Kwoon, an assistant professor in the NUS department of pharmacology. The drug des-aspartate-angiotensin I (DAA-I) acts on a receptor coupled to a specific prostaglandin pathway to suppress clot formation. The highly specific pathway limits any negative secondary effects. Currently, metal stents that are inserted into patients\u2019 blood vessels after angioplasty are coated with a bio-degradable polymer impregnated with drugs to prevent restenosis. However the existing stent drugs like Sirolimus and Paclitaxel are nonspecific immunosuppressant and anti-cancer drugs, which can also affect other cells.In commercialising the technology, NUS has entered into a licensing agreement with Medlogics Device Corporation, a US start-up company founded by a group of professionals with experience in medical devices and stents. The agreement was the first ever case where a Singapore drug innovation will enter global commercialised through the United States. It is also the first ever case where a specific new anti-restenosis drug is being incorporated into an equally new Medlogics technology. Medlogics has a proprietary coating technology that enables the drugs to be applied directly to the stent metal, avoiding the use of biodegradable polymers. The technology reduces the cost of making the drug-coated stents, ensures consistent release of drugs, and reduces the inflammation caused by the polymers. Medlogics selected DAA-I as the first drug for application with the new technology, out of a short list of seven final candidates.Similar to the other cases cited here, the NUS Industry Liaison Office played a key role in flanking Dr. Sim during the development and negotiation of the exclusive license agreement between the university and Medlogics.\nSource NUS Industrial Liaison Office\n",

These are platforms for CSI Singapore\u2019s approaches to key research themes in leukaemia and cancer diseases of the liver and lungs, which are endemic in Asian populations. In addition, the institute has also recently started a working group on breast cancer, looking at Asian phenotypes. CSI Singapore is housed on three floors of the Centre for Translational Medicine, within the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. The location is opposite the thousand-bed National University Hospital and close to a main subway line providing a link to the A*Star research institutes at Biopolis, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School and a second major hospital, the Singapore General. Core facilities and support technologies include the Centre for Translational Research and Diagnostics, a fluorescence-activated cell sorting facility, the Bioinformatics Core, a leukaemia cell bank, a transgenic and gene targeting facility and the Xenograft Cancer Models Facility. A number of the researchers working with CSI Singapore also hold positions at renowned international institutions such as the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital of Boston, Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute, the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure and Johns Hopkins University.\nMechanobiology Institute of Singapore\nThe Mechanobiology Institute was founded in 2009, under joint funding from the National Research Foundation and the Ministry of Education. The aim of the institute is both to advance the discipline and benefit the Singapore population. MBI\u2019s primary research focus is the identification, measurement and description of the forces for motility and morphogenesis at the molecular, cellular and tissue level. Toward that goal, the institute is working to create a common international standard for defining these steps by developing powerful new computational models, experimental reagents, and tools for studying diseases of cells and tissues. These basic discoveries are then transferred to both the clinic and the classroom, as a basis and support for scientific progress in the field of Mechanobiology. Towards these goals, the MBI has developed memoranda of understanding with a range of organisations, promoting cross-talk and active collaboration between MBI and partner institutions such as France\u2019s Centre National de la R\u00e9cherche Scientifique (CNRS), the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore (India), and the Waseda University in Japan. The focal areas for MBI research area: (i) stem cells and tissue engineering, (ii) development and cancer, (iii) microbes and pathogenesis.\nSource NUS website\n",
