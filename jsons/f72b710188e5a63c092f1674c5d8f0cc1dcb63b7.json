This finding opens new therapeutic perspectives, targeting lung injury, to improve the prognosis of OHCA patients. Experimentally, Cyclosporine A (CsA) has been shown to prevent systemic inflammation-induced ARF [2, 3] . To investigate the effect of CsA on ARF in the clinical setting, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of the prospective, multicenter, randomized CsA in OHCA resuscitation (CYRUS) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01595958).",

At admission, both the median (interquartile) ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the fractional inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) and the percentage of patients with ARF did not significantly differ between the CsA and the control groups: 211 (133-319) versus 207 (131-318) mmHg and 34.3% versus 32.3%, respectively. At 24 h, ARF was significantly less frequent in the CsA group (29.8%) compared to the control group (54.8%) and median PaO 2 / FiO 2 was 68 mmHg higher in the CsA group (Table 1) . Patients treated with CsA were also less likely to fulfill criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (Table 1) . Importantly, CsA was still independently associated with a lower risk for ARF after multivariate analysis (OR 0.33; 95%CI [0.16-0.70], p < 0.01) (Supplementary Table 1 ). This result was confirmed in the per-protocol population of the CYRUS trial (i.e. 61 patients who actually received CsA and 68 patients who did not) by both univariate analysis (ARF in 33% versus 50% of patients, respectively, p < 0.05) and multivariate analysis (OR 0.42; 95%CI [0.20-0.88], p = 0.02).",

Even though this post-hoc analysis of the CYRUS trial does not provide mechanistic insight, our findings are in line with both experimental and clinical studies reporting potent protective effects of CsA against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury [1, 2, 3, 5] . CsA may indeed limit I/R-induced cellular damages by inhibiting the cyclophilin D-dependent opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and by *Correspondence: martin.cour@chu-lyon.fr preserving oxidative phosphorylation [5] . In acute lung injury models, cytoprotection was also attributed to a decrease in circulating mitochondrial pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic factors [2, 3] . Studies are now needed to examine the longer-term effects of CsA on lung injury, which could not be done here due to high early mortality rate.",
