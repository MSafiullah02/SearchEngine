It was then circulated and discussed amongst all authors and a consensus was reached for this framework. It was subsequently tested on various countries using multiple timepoints throughout the pandemic, the results of which were once again shared with all authors for feedback. The final model included was agreed upon by all authors. The model consists of the following factors:1.\nRecipient Outcome was defined using the national 5-year overall survival following liver transplantation of both adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) recipients.2.\nDonor/Graft Safety was described using the risk of morbidity or mortality of surgery to living donors in LDLT, and the risk associated with the use of marginal or extended criteria donors in DDLT. Due to varying practices of LDLT and DDLT across centers, this factor was fixed at a maximal value for this study.3.\nWaiting List Mortality was used as a measure of the clinical need for liver transplantation and defined using the annual national waiting list mortality where the higher the waiting list mortality, the greater the need for transplantation. This was calculated as the percentage of patients on the waiting list removed due to death each year.4.\nHealthcare Resources was used to quantify the operational burden on intensive care facilities by the viral pandemic. As such, Healthcare Resources was measured as the ratio of ICU beds to total number of active Covid-19 cases by country. The number of active cases is defined as the total number of confirmed cases minus recovered cases and deaths. The data was log-transformed using the minimum and maximum values obtained from all countries across all timepoints to increase granularity at the lower end of the scale, where ethical tension was highest.\n",

The overall score reflects the need for transplantation balanced by these four factors. An increasing score supports the continuation of transplant activity despite the competing needs of the pandemic, while a decreasing score suggests a need to limit activity. The QE score was computed for seven countries (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, US, Germany, UK and Italy) on 1, 12 and 24 March 2020 to reflect the changes that took place surrounding the WHO declaration of the pandemic.",

In LDLT, the ethical balance of donor safety juxtaposed against the survival benefit of the recipient has previously been termed \u201cdouble equipoise\u201d. 27 In DDLT, graft safety refers to the risk conferred to the recipient by the quality of the cadaveric graft. 28 For instance, centers with higher usage of marginal cadaveric grafts would potentially lower both their Recipient Outcome and Donor/Graft Safety axes but improve Waiting List Mortality. A limitation of this study is the fixed Donor/Graft Safety score for all countries. This was done in view of the variation in practice regarding the types of donors or grafts used between centers but sets an important framework that can be further modified based on local or national practices.",
