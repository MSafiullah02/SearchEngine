In cats without systemic signs, excision of the skin masses appeared to be associated with prolonged survival (up to 2.4 years).

            "text": "M yeloma-related disorders (MRD) arise from the neoplastic transformation of plasma cells or immunoglobulin-secreting B lymphocyte precursors. The classification of MRD is outlined in Fig 1. MRD are rare in the cat, accounting for 0.003-0.1% of all malignancies reported in 2 large case series. 1,2 By contrast, MRD account for ,1% of all tumors in dogs 3 and 1-2% of all neoplasia in humans. 4 Multiple myeloma (MM) is the archetypal MRD, and the diagnostic criteria in dogs and humans include the presence of neoplastic plasma cells in bone marrow accompanied by 1 or more of the following: (1) serum paraproteinemia, (2) immunoglobulin light chain (Bence-Jones) proteinuria, or (3) osteolytic bone lesions. 5, 6 Radiographically detectable bone lesions are observed in 80% of all human patients with an MRD. 7 Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) is defined as neoplastic plasma cell formation in soft tissue without primary evidence of bone marrow involvement and can be divided into cutaneous (CEMP) and noncutaneous (NCEMP) forms. [8] [9] [10] Thirteen cats with EMP and clinical data have been reported in the veterinary literature, although a variety of descriptors were used including ''plasma cell tumors'' and ''myeloma.'' Twelve cats had clinical features typically seen in MM. This finding differs from the situation observed in humans with MRD, where the majority of patients with CEMP and some patients with NCEMP have benign tumors. Overall, ,5% of humans affected by MRD have extramedullary involvement as a presenting manifestation. 11, 12 MRD is the most common cause of monoclonal paraproteinemia in cats accounting for 6 of 14 (43%) reported cases. 13 In the cat, the pathophysiology in MM and EMP is similar, typically resulting in the production of a serum paraprotein which may lead to hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS). [14] [15] [16] [17] Renal dysfunction may result from reduced perfusion, amyloidosis, increased filtration of immunoglobulin light chains, hypercalcemia, or tumor infiltration. 8, 13, 18, 19 Nonregenerative anemia is common. 15, 20 Little information regarding MRD in cats is available. Historically, the diagnostic criteria used in humans or dogs with MM have been applied to the cat, [20] [21] [22] despite the fact that many of the case reports of affected cats describe features that differ from those in dogs or humans. In this study, the a priori hypotheses were that cats with MRD commonly present with extramedullary involvement and uncommonly have radiographic bone lesions, in contrast to the situation observed in human patients. The aims of the study included description of the clinical, clinicopathologic and imaging features, as well as treatment and outcome in a large series of cats with MRD confirmed by cytology, or by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. A secondary aim of the study was to examine for any association between MRD and other diseases by assessment of medical records and from owner follow-up.",

For example, in both dogs and humans, cutaneous extramedullary plasmacytoma typically is nonsecretory and has a benign course with surgical excision being curative of an MRD. 12, 24 By contrast, in reports of 4 cats with skin masses all were paraproteinemic, suffered rapid tumor development, and were affected by multi-organ plasma cell infiltration. 8, 18, 25, 26 Similarly, in this case series, 2 cats with skin masses were paraproteinemic and had clinical or imaging evidence of internal involvement. Overall, hyperglobulinemia was seen less commonly in cats with skin masses in this study. Surgical excision appeared to be associated with prolonged survival (in comparison with those cats with abdominal organ or bone marrow involvement). This finding suggests that in some cats, at least, nonmetastatic or early CEMP was present. CEMP can, with time, develop into MM in a small proportion of human patients. 10, 12 This phenomenon has rarely been reported in the dog 27 or the cat. 26 For the most part, the cats with skin masses in this series were seen in general practice and further investigations often were limited. In particular, demonstration of the presence or absence of plasma cells in other tissues (eg, bone marrow, internal organs) generally was not carried out (Table 2) , so a conclusive diagnosis of CEMP could not be made.",

A monoclonal gammopathy has been reported in 1 cat that did not undergo immunohistochemistry or postmortem examination. 29 NCEMP is extremely rare in both dogs and humans. In these species, NCEMP behavior is unpredictable, with some neoplasms being apparently benign and others aggressive in nature. [30] [31] [32] [33] By comparison, all of the reported NCEMP in cats have been characterized by signs of systemic disease or metastatic behavior. 18, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Typically, the spleen and liver were infiltrated. Other infiltrated locations have included the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, stomach, epidura, orbit, and retroperitoneal space 18, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] In this series, NCEMP was documented in 5 cats (42% of cats with abdominal organ involvement had no pathologic evidence of bone marrow infiltration, Table 2 ). Five cats with abdominal organ neoplasia had concurrent bone marrow infiltration, and it could not be determined if these cats had MM (primary bone marrow involvement) with secondary extramedullary metastases or EMP (primary soft tissue involvement) with secondary bone marrow infiltration. Five of 10 cats with bone marrow infiltration did not undergo additional tissue investigations, and it is not known if other internal organs were involved.",

In human MM patients, there is no minimum level of clonal bone marrow plasma cell infiltration, because 5% of patients will have ,10% plasma cells in the marrow. 7 Plasma cell infiltration is associated with osteoclastic activation, which results in bone lysis in affected humans and dogs. 6, 7, 39 A recent retrospective study suggested that MRD in cats is commonly associated with osteolytic lesions. 22 However, these cats were evaluated at a single practice with an orthopedic bias. The true incidence of osteolysis in MRD in cats is not known. Our multicenter series included cats from a wide variety of medical and surgical disciplines in an attempt to avoid bias, although the conclusions that can be drawn are limited by the retrospective nature of the study. Thirteen cats underwent radiography, and only 1 cat had demonstrable osteolysis. This finding was significantly different from the situation observed in human patients with MRD, of whom approximately 80% have radiographically detectable bone pathology. 7 Furthermore, an overview of the literature determined that of 42 cats with MRD reported to have had radiography, only 14 (33%) had radiographically detectable bony lesions. 16, 19, 22, 40, 41 This observation does not take into account the possibility that there may have been a historic bias toward reporting cats with MRD and bone lesions, based on diagnostic criteria used for human patients with MM that have been extrapolated to the cat. A z-test comparing the literature-estimated prevalence of radiographic bone lesions in cats with MRD versus the prevalence observed in humans with MRD revealed a significant difference (33% versus 80%, P , .001). Based on the medical literature and the statistical analysis of this series, we conclude that the study hypothesis (cats with MRD uncommonly present with radiographic bone lesions in comparison with humans with MRD) is likely to be true.",

The hypotheses that cats with MRD at initial presentation (1) commonly display extramedullary involvement and (2) uncommonly have radiographically detectable bone lesions in comparison with human patients with MRD have been demonstrated. MRD in cats has a wide spectrum of dissemination and frequently displays aggressive neoplastic behavior. Additional careful clinical investigations are warranted. Although some skin masses truly may be CEMP and respond favorably to complete excision, there should be an awareness of the potential for underlying multi-organ involvement. In the presence of paraproteinemia, bone marrow aspirates and core biopsy samples should be examined. Abdominal organ involvement, especially of the spleen and liver, is common. In this series, there was good correlation between an abdominal organ abnormality seen at imaging (eg, radiography, ultrasonography) and tissue infiltration. Cats with abdominal involvement or bone marrow infiltration commonly displayed systemic signs of illness, but the majority responded well to chemotherapy and the median survival time of responders was 12.3 months.",
