Ficolins are collectins that are structurally and functionally related to MBL and are either present in serum or expressed in tissues including the lung. Limited variation in serum levels of L-and H-ficolin result from the presence of FCN2 and FCN3 polymorphisms. Initial studies on the impact of FCN2 polymorphisms or low L-ficolin levels do not seem to show major associations with respiratory infection. MBL is being developed as a new immunotherapeutic agent for prevention of infection in immunocompromised hosts. The available literature suggests that it may also be of benefit in MBL deficient patients with severe pneumonia. This review concentrates on clinical associations between MBL deficiency and susceptibility to respiratory tract infection.",

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a soluble pattern recognition protein that contributes to killing of a broad range of pathogenic micro-organisms via the lectin complement pathway and through opsonophagocytosis [1] . Deficiency states arise from polymorphisms in the structural and promoter sequences of the MBL2 gene. A large number of associations between MBL deficiency and lower respiratory tract infection have been documented through clinical studies in humans [2] [3] [4] [5] . While these have used different definitions of MBL deficiency, the commonality of association suggests that MBL does contribute to defences in the lung. Mechanistically it can be seen how MBL can contribute to respiratory mucosal and bloodstream defences as it can be shown to bind to numerous important respiratory pathogens, promoting C4 deposition ( fig. 1 ). If a cut-off serum level of 0.5 g/ml is used as a definition, the frequency of MBL deficiency is approximately 25% [5] . This common immunodeficiency state may therefore have a general role in predisposing to respiratory tract infection, an equally common infectious disease. Equally, it may be that in individuals with additional risk factors, MBL deficiency assumes a more significant role in predisposition to infection. This may apply to those with diseased respiratory mucosa such as cystic fibrosis patients [6] or lowered immunity as with infants in the 'window of vulnerability' [7] between the disappearance of maternal antibody and maturation of adaptive immune responses.",

            "text": "MBL initiates complement activation via the lectin pathway and promotes opsonophagocytosis. Both these actions can be measured but most work has focused on the complement pathway. MBL2 structural gene polymorphisms affect the assembly of this complex molecule and clearly interfere with its complement activating function. The wild-type MBL2 allele is referred to as A with variants being B, C and D or collectively, O [8] . The promoter polymorphisms H/L and X/Y influence the serum level of the protein [8] . As such there is a correlation between the MBL2 haplotype and MBL level and function. This is not precise as many individuals with wild-type MBL genes still have low or unmeasurable MBL levels and function [8] . Consequently, studies that explore infectious diseases associations with low producing MBL2 genotypes alone may underestimate these. It may be that MBL definitions based solely on low MBL level ( ! 0.5 g/ ml) [5] or, ideally, MBL function ( ! 0.2 U/ l C4 deposition) [9] are most appropriate for determining such associations. In this regard it is important to state that MBL levels do not alter by more than 3-4 times baseline levels during inflammation [10] . To date, most MBL-disease association studies have assessed MBL2 genotypes with or without MBL levels. Where MBL levels or function were used to explore infectious disease association this will be specifically noted in this review. Less common is the entity of mannose-binding lectin associated serine protease 2 (MASP2) deficiency, which also leads to MBL functional deficiency [11] . MASP2 deficiency is less studied than MBL at a population and disease association level.",

No appreciable MBL transcription was found by real-time PCR on lung tissue [13] , so MBL present in respiratory secretions most likely represents 'leakage' from the serum ( fig. 1 ) . A number of case series have investigated levels of MBL in the lungs and essentially shown that it is present in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with pneumonia but not where the lungs were not inflamed [14] [15] [16] . Median lung MBL levels were 0.015-0.019 g/ml [14, 16] with a maximal lung level of MBL from a case of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia was 0.078 g/ml [14] which compares with serum levels that range from 0 to 7.9 g/ [8] . These studies all measure MBL levels in BAL fluid and do not make allowance for dilution or comparison with lung proteins of know concentrations. It is estimated though that lung MBL levels are likely to be between 1 and 2 logs higher than those measured in BAL [16] and, therefore, to be at least equal to the minimum range of 0.3-0.4 g/ml required for complement activation [17] . Further data are required on levels and function of MBL in respiratory secretions. The severity of pulmonary inflammation is probably also a factor controlling the amount of MBL present in the lungs. Animal studies have documented that MBL was present in lung secretions of laboratory mice only after prolonged infection with virulent influenza virus. No MBL was found in respiratory secretions in mice infected with an influenza strain that replicated poorly in the lungs [18] .",

Furthermore, a large study of Tanzanian patients showed no association between MBL2 alleles and tuberculosis susceptibility [46] . There are not obvious differences in the overall frequency of MBL alleles between these diverse study populations or methodological differences to account for these discrepancies. The Indi-an group have followed up their study with another that documents decreased M. tuberculosis phagocytosis in wild-type MBL patients with pulmonary tuberculosis despite them having higher MBL levels than healthy controls [47] . This observation has not been repeated for M. tuberculosis to date. There are also conflicting results regarding MBL-mediated phagocytosis in the case of MAC. Initially, MBL was shown to increase neutrophil phagocytosis of MAC [22] but more recently, while MBL binding to MAC was confirmed, it has been shown to not increase macrophage phagocytosis, unlike SP-A and SP-D [48] .

The high levels of neutrophil enzymes found in the sputum of CF patients were also able to degrade MBL in vitro [60] . A large study of Canadian CF patients confirmed this association, showing that those with lowproducing MBL genotypes were colonised with P. aeruginosa at an earlier age. There was also a significant interaction between another variant gene, transforming growth factor beta 1, which was previously shown to affect CF progression [61] , and MBL deficiency in this study with a higher rate of decline in lung function demonstrated [6] . Other groups have also found associations between MBL status and CF disease parameters. Accelerated reduction of lung function was found in North American CF patients with MBL levels ! 0.2 g/ml [62] .

In a cohort of Polish children with recurrent respiratory tract infection, a group of patients with underlying atopic disorder were significantly more likely to have L-ficolin levels less than the lower range seen in healthy controls. The same did not apply to the group of children with recurrent infection but no other detectable laboratory abnormalities [77] . No association between FCN2 polymorphisms and disease susceptibility [78] was found in the UK invasive pneumococcal disease cohort previously studied for MBL deficiency association [2] . MBL status did not appear to alter the negative disease association with FCN2 polymorphism [78] . To date, the FCN1 and FCN3 single nucleotide polymorphisms have not been sufficiently characterised to comment on their potential disease associations and clinical significance [72] . Overall, it can be said that ficolins play an overlapping role in mediating lectin pathway complement killing with MBL but the presence of ficolin-deficiency states that predispose to infectious diseases is uncertain.

There are substantial differences seen in the pulmonary and serum levels of SP-A and SP-D but few associations between either protein levels or genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility to respiratory tract infection [80] . Most of the above studies that demonstrate associations between MBL deficiency and respiratory infection do not additionally test for surfactant protein variation so the interdependence of these factors remains unresolved.

This would be an appropriate explanation for the recent observations of increased mortality in bacterial pneumonia [5] and the reduced susceptibility to severe tuberculosis in patients with low MBL levels [44] . Future investigation of the interaction of the MBL present in respiratory secretions with pneumonic pathogens may substantiate an active role for the molecule in respiratory mucosal defences. Information from clinical studies available to date shows that MBL appears to play an important role in reducing susceptibility to severe chest infection as soon as respiratory pathogens enter the blood stream.",
