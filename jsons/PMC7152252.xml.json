However, in contrast to FIV infection, many cats in the early state of FeLV infection regress to a permanent state of viral latency (\u201cregressive infection\u201d). It is possible that some cats, after exposure to a low dose of FeLV, may eliminate the infection altogether (\u201cabortive infection\u201d), although this appears to be a rare outcome. Regardless, a positive test result for FeLV infection in an apparently healthy cat does not always imply that FeLV-related disease and mortality will occur.",

There are three main subtypes of FeLV: FeLV-A, FeLV-B, and FeLV-C. Each subtype uses a different receptor to enter cells (Table 22-1\n). All cats infected with FeLV-B and FeLV-C are co-infected with FeLV-A, and only FeLV-A is transmitted between animals. FeLV-B and FeLV-C are more pathogenic than FeLV-A. FeLV-B arises through recombination of FeLV-A proviral DNA with endogenous FeLV sequences present in host cellular DNA.3 FeLV-C arises from accumulation of mutations or insertions in the env (SU) gene of FeLV-A.4., 5. The FeLV subtype influences the clinical expression of disease (see Table 22-1). For example, FeLV-C is associated with nonregenerative anemia. Even within an FeLV subtype, mutations in the SU and the LTR regions of the viral genome affect disease outcome.6., 7. An additional subtype, FeLV-T, has been associated with immunodeficiency.",

            "text": "Transmission of FeLV-A primarily results from close contact with salivary secretions, such as through licking, mutual grooming, and shared food and water dishes. Other routes of transmission, such as by biting, blood transfusion, in milk, and possibly by fleas, can also occur.8., 9., 10. The virus survives poorly outside the cat and is readily inactivated by disinfectants, soap, and desiccation. The overall prevalence of FeLV infection has declined over the past two decades with more extensive testing and vaccination. Before the institution of widespread testing and vaccination, more than 30% of cats in some catteries were infected.11 In the early 1990s, the overall prevalence of infection was 13% in nearly 28,000 sick cats from North America that were at risk for exposure.12 The prevalence was just 7% in a similar population of approximately 1400 cats in 2006.13 The prevalence of FeLV infection in European cats has also declined markedly.14 Currently, the overall prevalence of infection in mixed populations of cats is 1% to 6%.13., 15., 16., 17., 18., 19. Cats with access to the outdoors; those that have contact with other cats; cats that are male, aggressive, or intact; and cats that are co-infected with FIV are at increased risk of FeLV infection.12., 13., 15., 17. Male cats are less strongly predisposed to FeLV infection than to FIV infection, and in some studies,20 no male predisposition has been recognized. Adult cats are more likely to be infected with FeLV than cats aged less than 6 months,13., 17. but the median age of cats infected with FeLV is 3 years,15 which is lower than that for FIV. This reflects a) the greater degree of pathogenicity of FeLV than FIV and its ability to significantly reduce lifespan; and b) the phenomenon of age-related resistance to FeLV, whereby exposure of cats that are less than 4 months of age to the virus is much more likely to lead to progressive infection than exposure of adults.21 When 12- to 16-week old kittens are exposed to a multicat household with endemic FeLV infection, between 60% and 70% of kittens will become infected within a 5-month time period. In contrast, less than 5% of cats aged 6 months or older will become infected over the same time period; over a 2-year period, 40% to 50% of these adult cats will become infected. Infection of adult cats can also still occur with exposure to high doses of the virus or when there is underlying host immune compromise.",

            "text": "Opportunistic infections may develop in FeLV infections as a result of myelo suppression or an acquired cell-mediated immunodeficiency. The immunosuppressive properties of FeLV are not fully understood but have been linked in part to the viral envelope peptide, p15E, which inhibits T and B cell function, inhibits cytotoxic lymphocyte responses, alters monocyte morphology and distribution, and has been associated with impaired cytokine production and responsiveness.25., 26., 27., 28. Kittens with progressive FeLV infection have impaired T cell and, to a lesser extent, B cell function.29., 30., 31., 32. Infected cats may develop lymphopenia, thymic atrophy, and depletion of lymphocytes within lymph node paracortical zones. CD4+ T cell malfunction may contribute to a decreased humoral and cell-mediated immune response in affected cats,33., 34. and the response to vaccination may also be impaired. Impaired neutrophil function compounds the effect of neutropenia in some infected cats.35., 36., 37. Opportunistic infections that result include bacterial infections of the upper and lower urinary tract, hemoplasmosis, upper respiratory tract infections, feline infectious peritonitis, chronic stomatitis, toxoplasmosis, dermatophytosis, and cryptococcosis (Figure 22-3\n). The prevalence of some of these infections in cats with FeLV infection does not differ significantly from that in cats not infected with FeLV, but clinical signs are more severe and refractory to therapy. Infection with FeLV is an established risk factor for hemoplasma infection. In one study, it was also a risk factor for Bartonella henselae infection, but no evidence of clinical disease was identified in the cats infected with B. henselae.38\n",

Cats infected with FeLV are more than 60-fold more likely to develop lymphoma than cats not infected with FeLV; this compares with approximately 5-fold for FIV.40 Lymphoma or leukemia can be detected in nearly one quarter of cats with progressive FeLV infection at necropsy.41 In the 1980s, as many as 70% of cases of feline lymphoma were associated with FeLV infection, but with improved control measures and vaccination, the vast majority of cats (more than 80% to 90%) seen at veterinary clinics with lymphoma now test negative for FeLV antigen.42., 43., 44. The most common types of lymphoma in cats infected with FeLV are thymic (mediastinal), multicentric, spinal, renal, or ocular lymphoma. FeLV-associated lymphomas are mostly of T-cell origin, but B cell lymphoma can also occur. In contrast, FIV-associated lymphomas tend to be of B-cell origin.42 Approximately 80% of cats with thymic lymphoma test positive for FeLV antigen, whereas fewer than 10% of cats with gastrointestinal lymphoma are FeLV antigen-positive. Large granular lymphoma is rarely associated with FeLV infection.45 Cats with thymic lymphoma typically develop clinical signs of lethargy, tachypnea, and sometimes regurgitation. Most FeLV-positive cats with lymphoma are less than 4 years of age.14\n",

Approximately 90% of FeLV-associated anemias are nonregenerative.61 A variety of bone marrow disorders lead to decreased red blood cell production. FeLV-C infection results in pure red cell aplasia, a severe nonregenerative anemia associated with erythrocyte macrocytosis and depletion of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. This occurs because FeLV-C binds to and interferes with a heme exporter protein, which results in subsequent heme toxicosis to the developing erythrocyte.62 The presence of macrocytosis in the absence of reticulocytosis should thus raise suspicion for FeLV infection. FeLV infection can also lead to aplastic anemia in some cats, which is a deficiency in all cell lineages (platelets, myeloid, and erythroid) in the bone marrow, and replacement of the bone marrow space by adipose tissue. Anemia and bone marrow dysfunction may also result from myelophthisis secondary to leukemia, myeloid and/or erythroid dysplasia, or myelofibrosis (progressive replacement of the marrow with collagenous connective tissue) (Figure 22-4\n). Myelodysplasia is characterized by disordered maturation of marrow precursors, which in some cases precedes emergence of leukemia. FeLV infection underlies many myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and leukemia in cats.63 However, over the past two decades, 50% of 28 cats with myelodysplasia and 44% of 41 cats with leukemia seen at the University of California, Davis, tested negative for FeLV antigen in peripheral blood, and only 36% of 34 cats with dysmyelopoiesis seen at the University of Minnesota were positive for FeLV antigen.64 Several different classification systems have been used to describe feline MDS.64 The French-American-British (FAB) classification scheme used for humans has been modified for dogs and cats. This divides MDS into 2 groups: 1) MDS with refractory cytopenia (less than 6% myeloblasts in the bone marrow, MDS-RC) and 2) MDS with excessive numbers of myeloblasts (6% to 30% myeloblasts, MDS-EB). The presence of more than 30% blasts indicates leukemia. The most common form of MDS in cats is MDS-EB.64 Regressive FeLV infections have been detected by proviral DNA PCR in some cats with bone marrow disorders,65 but the relationship between the presence of proviral DNA and the pathogenesis of disordered marrow function is unclear.BOX 22-2Mechanisms of Anemia in Cats Infected with FeLVDecreased RBC Production\nPure red cell aplasia (FeLV-C)Aplastic anemiaLeukemia (myelophthisis)MyelofibrosisAnemia of inflammatory disease\nRBC Loss\nThrombocytopenia secondary to immune-mediated or bone marrow disease\nIncreased RBC Destruction\nFeLV-associated IMHACo-infection with hemoplasmas\nIMHA, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.",

Hemorrhage as a result of thrombocytopenia or defective platelet function may also contribute to anemia. Mechanisms of thrombocytopenia include immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) and bone marrow dysfunction. Similarly, neutropenia can result from myeloid hypoplasia, myelofibrosis, myelodysplasia, myelophthisis, or maturation arrest at the myelocyte or metamyelocyte stages.

Positive test results in the absence of FeLV antigen have the potential to occur rarely as a result of operator error or nonspecific reactivity.82 As for FIV infection, it is especially important to immediately confirm positive test results if they are likely to result in euthanasia or rehoming for disease control purposes. There are several options to confirm a positive test result:\u2022Perform another ELISA antigen test using an assay from a different manufacturer. However, it should be remembered that in contrast to FIV infection, cats that test truly positive for FeLV antigen early in the course of infection (i.e., before involvement of the bone marrow) may ultimately control the infection. Thus a single positive test result does not imply progressive infection, even if it is immediately repeatable using a test from a different manufacturer. If the cat has signs consistent with FeLV-related disease, a single positive test result is more likely to mean that progressive infection is present.\u2022Perform an IFA assay on peripheral blood smears, because cats with positive IFA results have infection of the bone marrow and, with rare exceptions, are almost always progressively infected. Cats that test negative with IFA assays may be in a transient viremic phase that may result in either progressive or regressive infection, or they may have progressive infection but the sensitivity of IFA is too low to detect it. In this case, both ELISA and IFA assays, or the ELISA assay alone, could be repeated in 1 to 4 months.\u2022Retest with ELISA 6 months later. If the antigen test remains positive, progressive infection is likely. In some cats, antigenemia persists for 16 weeks before regression occurs, so the test could be repeated earlier than 6 months (e.g., 12 weeks later) or monthly if client finances permit so long as the cat remains healthy.\u2022Perform a full CBC.

Performing IFA on bone marrow rather than peripheral blood may help to overcome this problem. False-positive results can occur when inexperienced laboratory personnel interpret nonspecific fluorescence as a positive test result. They also have the potential to occur when the antibody conjugates bind nonspecifically to eosinophil granules, so eosinophils must be excluded in interpretation of fluorescing cells.83\n",

The clinician needs to understand if the assay used detects proviral DNA, viral RNA, or both (some laboratories run both assays), because the clinical significance of a positive viral RNA assay (i.e., productive viral infection) differs from that of a positive proviral DNA assay (which suggests nonproductive viral infection for cats with negative antigen tests). After infection, RT-PCR assays may be positive several weeks before antigen tests or virus isolation become positive,84 and depending on the assay, PCR for viral RNA can be more sensitive than soluble antigen tests.

However, because vaccination protects cats from progressive infection, it is indicated for all at-risk cats, such as those with outdoor exposure or those that reside in households with other FeLV antigen-positive cats. The American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) highly recommends that all FeLV antigen-negative kittens be vaccinated for FeLV, because of the potential that some of these kittens may escape or become outdoor cats, even when the intention of the owner is to keep the kitten indoors.100 Vaccination is also recommended for cats entering shelters that are likely to be housed with other cats.79 Two doses are given in the left pelvic limb as distally as possible, 3 to 4 weeks apart from 8 to 9 weeks of age, followed by a booster at 1 year and then every 1 to 3 years thereafter, although more information is required on the duration of immunity for FeLV vaccines. The European Advisory Bureau on Cat Diseases (ABCD) suggests a booster every 2 to 3 years for cats older than 3 to 4 years of age, in light of the lower susceptibility of adult cats to infection.101 Annual boosters are required for recombinant vaccines. Acutely ill cats should not be vaccinated, but it is acceptable to vaccinate cats with chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney disease. Testing for FeLV should be performed before each booster if exposure to FeLV was likely before the booster was required (which should apply for most cats vaccinated for FeLV). Vaccination with FeLV vaccines has been associated with injection-site sarcomas, so only cats that are likely to be exposed should be vaccinated.",

Routine hand-washing precautions are indicated for hospitalized cats, and precautions should be taken (such as the wearing of gloves) to protect FeLV-infected cats from nosocomial pathogens. Fomites such as food and water bowls and litter boxes should not be shared between FeLV antigen-negative cats and cats with unknown or antigen-positive FeLV status. Neutering can prevent roaming and reduce the likelihood of FeLV infection. When a cat from a multicat household tests antigen-positive, all cats should be tested and retested and positive cats should be separated from other cats if possible. Euthanasia is recommended for sick, FeLV-positive cats that enter shelters.101 People who adopt cats that have unknown retrovirus status from shelters should be educated about the disease and the need for quarantine and testing after adoption.",

The diarrhea had been present for 3 days and was greenish, mucoid, and occurred once to twice daily. The owner reported that Hamster had vomited yellow fluid at least three times during this period and was completely inappetent. Her urination habits had not changed. Hamster was taken to a local veterinary clinic on the first day of illness, where a physical examination revealed pyrexia (105.1\u00b0F or 40.6\u00b0C). She was treated with clavulanic acid\u2013amoxicillin and a single intramuscular injection of enrofloxacin but there was no clinical improvement. Hamster had tested positive for FeLV antigen 1.5 years ago, after which time she had been housed exclusively indoors. She lived with some caged birds and three other FeLV-positive cats. None of the other cats were ill. Hamster played with elastic bands, but there was no known toxin exposure and no recent changes in her environment. Her diet usually consisted of a commercial dry cat food.Physical ExaminationBody Weight6.9 kgGeneralQuiet, alert, responsive, hydrated, T = 104.4\u00b0F (40.2\u00b0C), HR = 220 beats/min, RR = 36 breaths/min, mucous membranes pink, CRT = 1 s.

The colon was relatively empty with a small amount of fluid. No masses were identified. There was renal asymmetry with poor visualization of the right kidney. Abdominal serosal detail appeared normal.Abdominal SonographyThe right kidney could not be identified. The left kidney appeared normal and measured 4.2 cm in length. A small amount of fluid was present in the colon. The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.Microbiologic and Virologic TestingAerobic bacterial urine culture: negativePoint-of-care ELISA serology for FeLV antigen and FIV antibody: positive for FeLV antigenPCR for Mycoplasma haemofelis and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum (whole blood): negativeDiagnosisProgressive FeLV infection with suspected acute pyelonephritis (characterized by fever, gastrointestinal signs, bacteriuria, neutrophilia with a left shift, and mild thrombocytopenia). Right renal agenesis (likely congenital).TreatmentHamster was hospitalized and treated with intravenous fluids, enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg, slow IV, q24h) and ampicillin (20 mg/kg, IV, q8h) (note that the parenteral use of enrofloxacin in this cat was off-label and has the potential to cause irreversible blindness). Her temperature normalized within 24 hours, and there was no more vomiting or diarrhea. After 48 hours, the hematocrit was 27.6%, neutrophil count was 5759 cells/\u00b5L with no bands or toxicity, and lymphocyte count was 917 cells/\u00b5L. She was discharged from the hospital with instructions to continue antibiotic treatment for 1 month. Two weeks after the antibiotics had been discontinued, she was apparently healthy and a physical examination, CBC, kidney panel, urinalysis, and aerobic bacterial urine culture showed no abnormalities. Her hematocrit was 38.9%, white cell count was 4620 cells/\u00b5L, and platelet count was 220,000/\u00b5L. One year later, she remained clinically healthy and a CBC showed a hematocrit of 38.2%, white cell count of 4500 cells/\u00b5L, neutrophil count of 3362 cells/\u00b5L, lymphocyte count of 905 cells/\u00b5L, and a monocyte count of 45 cells/\u00b5L. Despite the mild cytopenias present, Hamster remained alive and well with a normal CBC 4 years after she was initially seen for gastrointestinal signs. She died 2 years after that, 7.5 years after she first tested positive for FeLV infection.One of the other cats in the household, a 5-year-old, male neutered domestic medium hair cat, was euthanized 1.5 years after Hamster was initially evaluated. He developed severe normocytic, normochromic nonregenerative anemia (HCT 10.5%, with 5200 reticulocytes and 11 nucleated RBC/HPF) with neutropenia (1320 cells/\u00b5L) in association with circulating blast cells.CommentsEven though this cat was initially seen for moderately severe illness in association with progressive FeLV infection, she made a full recovery with treatment and remained alive and well for 6 additional years. The nonregenerative anemia likely resulted from inflammatory disease. The negative urine culture may have resulted from recent treatment with antimicrobial drugs, and renal ultrasound is insensitive for diagnosis of pyelonephritis. The age of this cat, the strain of FeLV involved, and the challenge dose, as well as other environmental and genetic factors, probably all played a role in the course of disease. This case clearly demonstrates that other treatable diseases may be present in FeLV-infected cats and that search for the underlying cause of clinical signs and adequate treatment is always recommended. The second cat in the household likely also had progressive FeLV infection; the development of anemia suggested infection with FeLV-C.\n",

Soluble antigen assays and proviral PCR assays become positive from about the third week after infection, and virus is shed in saliva, tears, urine, and feces.

Cats with focal or atypical infection are never or transiently antigen positive and test negative using PCR assays on blood or bone marrow, but some tissues (such as the mammary gland or bladder) are positive with proviral PCR.
