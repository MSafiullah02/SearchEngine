There is a strong rationale for a universal mask policy. Wearing a face mask will not only prevent airborne viral transmission but also reduce the likelihood of one's hands touching the mouth and nose. It is particularly needed to prevent the transmission from asymptomatic medical professionals to patients and colleagues. Due to the current shortage of masks, it is prudent to conserve masks whenever possible. More than 100 billion masks will be needed for 300 million Americans annually if one person uses one mask per day. Currently this is far beyond the capacity of U.S. face mask manufacturing.",

The filtration layer of masks is made of meltblown polypropylene that determines the pore size of a face mask. An analysis of five different decontamination methods identified dry heat as a preferred method 3 . Although the dry heat approach did not significantly change the filtration efficiency of meltblown polypropylene, it forms crystals at higher temperature 4 Heating at 65-70 o C can be achieved by baking in an oven, incubator, or even a blanket warmer.",

Therefore, surgical masks should not be used when in contact with potential Covid-19-positive patients.",
