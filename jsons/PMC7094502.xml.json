            "text": "Many extreme weather events, such as heavy rains, heat waves and droughts, have increased in frequency or magnitude due to global warming (Rahmstorf and Coumou, 2011). Floods are the most frequent natural disaster and have been more widely documented than any other natural disaster. Their frequency has tended to intensify in recent decades as well as in China, and this trend is projected to increase with climate change (Cao et al., 2013; Milly et al., 2002). Floods are widespread in China, and particularly noteworthy in coastal areas, such as Guangxi, where most of the precipitation is concentrated in rainy seasons. A study suggested that a significantly increasing trend has been observed in the population's vulnerability to floods, and the areas include the southwestern provinces, such as Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan and Guangxi and the central provinces, such as Hubei and Jiangxi (Wang et al., 2014). In Guangxi, the floods between 2005 and 2012 forced an evacuation of thousands of people from homelands, with over 89.65 million people affected (The Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, 2013). The floods hit 5.10 million hectares of crops, of which 2.40 million hectares were demolished (The Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, 2013). The economic damage was estimated at approximately 55.11 billion Yuan (US$ 8.24 billion) (The Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, 2013). Floods not only cause enormous losses of people's lives and property, but also pose a major public health threat. It is important to study the impact of floods on human health for forecasting and informing the population, in order to help minimise negative consequences.",

At present, infectious diseases still represent a significant public health problem in China, with over 7 million cases (incidence rate was 509.54 per 100,000) reported in 2017(Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). The health effects of floods are complex and far-reaching, which may include increased mortality and morbidity from some infectious diseases. Flood disasters may lead to infectious disease outbreaks when they result in substantial population displacement, microbes, vectors and reservoir animal hosts exploit the disrupted social and environmental conditions for disease transmission (Kouadio et al., 2012; McMichael, 2015). Studies at home and abroad show that floods can increase the risk of infectious diseases, e.g., cholera (Rieckmann et al., 2018; Sidley, 2008), bacillary dysentery (Liu et al., 2015, 2017), leptospirosis (Mohd Radi et al., 2018), malaria (Ding et al., 2014) and dengue fever (Dayrit et al., 2018). However, evidence on the association between floods and infectious diseases is far from clear. Few studies have been conducted about the identification of flood-sensitive infectious diseases. To our knowledge, although previous studies have confirmed an increased risk of individual infectious diseases during a flooding, there are few relevant studies on the identification of the spectrum of infectious diseases associated with floods in one area. Flood-sensitive infectious diseases remain unclear in China. At present, further strong epidemiological evidence is still needed to study the impact of floods on infectious diseases.",

There are 111 administrative regions at the county level in Guangxi, including 39 municipal districts, 8 county-level cities, 52 counties and 12 autonomous counties. Two county-level administrative districts were selected for each region as the study sties, and our study areas covered ten county-level administrative districts (i.e., Guiping, Mengshan, municipal district of Nanning, municipal district of Qinzhou, municipal district of Baise, municipal district of Hechi, municipal district of Guilin, Xing'an, municipal district of Liuzhou and Rong'an). The similar geographic locations determine the characteristics of the subtropical monsoon climate in the study sites. The annual average temperature in these study sites is 16.5\u201323.1 \u00b0C, and the annual average rainfall is above 1070 mm. The study sites have clear dry and rainy seasons, with the rainy season from April to September and dry season from October to March. Precipitation in the rainy season accounts for 70\u201385% of the annual precipitation, making them prone to floods.",

There are currently 39 notifiable infectious diseases in China. Epidemiological reviews have suggested that floods may be contributing to the spread of the most notifiable infectious diseases, in addition to blood and sexually transmitted diseases (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, gonorrhoea and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and neonatal tetanus (Ahern et al., 2005; Alderman et al., 2012; Du et al., 2010; Hajat et al., 2005; Ivers and Ryan, 2006; Llewellyn, 2006). Therefore, the blood and sexually transmitted diseases and neonatal tetanus were no longer identified in this study according to the mechanism of disease transmission and biological plausibility of these diseases during floods. Then, the descriptive analysis was conducted to describe the incidence and temporal distribution of infectious diseases. Based on the inter-quartile range, diseases with annual average incidence rates less than the lower quartile were defined as low-incidence infectious diseases. The diseases with low incidence during the study period were not incorporated in the next analysis because a small number of cases of these diseases may result in uncertainty and instability of the study results when assessing the effect of floods.",

Guangxi is located at low latitude with a subtropical monsoon climate. Seasonal variation in Guangxi is not obvious, but dry and rainy seasons are distinct. Hence, the period of April\u2013September between 2005 and 2012 was selected as our study period in order to control for seasonality. The exposure periods were the ten-day period with flooding in the study sites and the ten-day period without flooding or other meteorological disasters (e.g., heat wave) was a candidate for control periods during the rainy season. In this study, the control periods were selected according to the time-stratified approach of a time-stratified case-crossover design (Levy et al., 2001; Lumley and Levy, 2000). Thus, every ten-day period within the same rainy season and year of the exposure period was considered a control period. If more than one flood occurred in the same rainy season, other ten-day periods with flooding were excluded as control periods. Because floods may occur any time during the same rainy season, all control periods may be distributed before one exposure period, or after one exposure period, or before and after the exposure period (i.e., several control periods were randomly distributed, and the exposure period was not fixed at a certain location). A study indicates that this referent selection is not subject to bias resulting from time trend and can be used as a control for seasonality (Janes et al., 2005a). In addition, this referent selection avoids overlap bias associated with a multifactor model (Janes et al., 2005b). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to examine the difference in the ten-day attack rate of infectious diseases between the exposure and control periods with different lagged effects. Relative risks (RRs) were derived by comparing the attack rate of infectious diseases between exposure and reference periods. The optimal lag time was selected based on the maximum RRs because the best estimate of duration had minimal non-differential misclassification at this point (Maclure, 1991).",

Zero-inflated regression is a practical way to model count data with both excess zeros and positive counts, as such models, incorporating covariates, can be estimated simultaneously in the extra zeros and the count distributional components of the model (Carrel et al., 2010; Cheung, 2002). Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) are the two most popular models (Zuur et al., 2009). In our study, we first determined whether zero-inflation existed in the count data of infectious diseases. Then, a likelihood ratio test that alpha = 0 was performed for overdispersion, which compares the sample mean with the sample variance (B\u00f6hning et al., 1997; Xu et al., 2017). If the likelihood ratio test of alpha was not significant, the ZIP was adopted to explore the relationship between floods and infectious diseases; otherwise, the ZINB was adopted. The Vuong test was also performed to determine whether the apparent overdispersion was induced by the extra number of zeros and which regression model was more suitable for this study (Vuong, 1989). In the final models, the ZINB models were selected to examine the relationship between amoebic dysentery, acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), influenza, measles, rabies, Japanese encephalitis and floods; the ZIP models were selected to explore the influence of floods on influenza A (H1N1) and leptospirosis.",

An increased risk of enteric infectious diseases following floods has been reported in some developing countries. For example, a cholera outbreak hit Mozambique after severe flooding in 2008, with many people dying from the disease (Sidley, 2008). During flood-associated epidemics, Vibrio cholerae is the most commonly identified cause of diarrhoea, and rotavirus is the second most frequently identified flood-associated pathogen in Dhaka, Bangladesh (Schwartz et al., 2006). In Bangladesh, approximately two-thirds of the tube-wells and all toilets became unusable during the floods of 1998 and 2004 and approximately half of the affected population suffered from diarrhoeal diseases (Shimi et al., 2010). Even in high-income countries, although the risk of outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness during floods is low, the risk of gastrointestinal illness increases with the severity of the disaster (Reacher et al., 2004; Wade et al., 2004). After floods, there is great concern for respiratory infection from exposures to these extraordinary conditions, especially among those at higher risk of developing illnesses from exposure to respiratory pathogens. Approximately 30% of displaced individuals seeking medical care in Sri Lanka after the 2004 tsunami disaster complained of respiratory problems (Lim et al., 2005). After the 2005 floods in England, many of the respondents had suffered a number of minor ailments, which included recurring flu-like symptoms, such as coughs, sore throats, etc. (Carroll et al., 2010). One study from rural Bangladesh shows evidence of a moderate elevation in risk of acute respiratory infection during the 2 years after flooding (Milojevic et al., 2012). Floods can potentially increase the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as leptospirosis, Japanese encephalitis, malaria, dengue, rabies, etc. (Afzal and Sultan, 2013; Ding et al., 2014; Matsushita et al., 2018; Mohd Radi et al., 2018; Saeed and Piracha, 2016; Smith et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016). Similar findings have been reported in our study. Our study shows that the attack rates of bacillary dysentery, amoebic dysentery, other infectious diarrhoea, AHC, influenza A (H1N1), tuberculosis, influenza, measles, rabies, Japanese encephalitis and leptospirosis in the exposure periods were significantly higher than those in the control periods. The results indicate that floods may play an important role in the risk of those diseases in the study sites. Due to the delayed environmental transport of pathogens and delayed onset of clinical symptoms, this study has identified a lagged effect of floods on bacillary dysentery, amoebic dysentery, other infectious diarrhoea, influenza A (H1N1), tuberculosis, rabies and leptospirosis. The factors that may affect the lagged effect include the growth of pathogens under suitable environmental conditions, spread through contaminated food or water and other health infrastructures, spread through the expansion in the number and range of vector habitats and the incubation period of those diseases. However, this study showed no association between floods and some infectious diseases (e.g., cholera, malaria, dengue fever, etc.), which were linked to floods in the literature review. This may be because the prevention and control of these infectious diseases has high priority in this region.",

In flood conditions, there is potential for increased transmission of enteric infectious diseases, especially in areas where the population does not have access to clean water and sanitation. The underlying mechanisms by which floods influence bacillary dysentery and AHC are not yet clear. We propose that the disruption of sewage systems and contamination of drinking water during floods may contribute to bacillary dysentery and AHC epidemics (Kunii et al., 2002). Heavy rainfalls have also been associated with increases in measurable Shigella and pathogenic viruses (such as Enterovirus 70) in water. One study from Pakistan indicated that twenty percent of the drinking water samples collected during the flood period were contaminated with Shigella and other enter pathogens, including Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterovirus (Khan et al., 2013). In addition, lack of clean water, overcrowding, insufficient understanding of personal and domestic hygiene, nutritional deficiency, and overall poor sanitation are the major contributing factors for the spread of diarrhoeal diseases. A study showed that post-flood resettlement, overcrowding and compromised quality of water and hygiene in Ethiopia contributed to a high incidence of diarrhoeal disease (Wakuma Abaya et al., 2009). A German study also showed that the major risk factor for enteric infectious diseases was contact with floodwater (OR = 5.8, 95% CI: 1.3\u201325.1) (Schnitzler et al., 2007).",

Overcrowding and an interruption in public health campaigns after natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, Tsunami, etc.) can impact the incidence of a number of vaccine-preventable illnesses, including measles, meningitis and influenza (Ivers and Ryan, 2006). According to a systematic review, measles case fatality rates in complex emergencies may be as high as 33%, compared with a mortality rate in stable populations of approximately 1% (Wilder-Smith, 2005). Therefore, we speculate that the possible reasons for the increase in influenza A (H1N1), tuberculosis and influenza caused by floods were: the cold chain work was interrupted by flood disasters, and many vaccination stations stopped their public health services; floods caused a large number of displaced people and resulted in the accumulation of susceptible populations; poor health resources, poor nutrition and irregular life during the floods were also a possible factor to increase the risk of respiratory infectious diseases (Ivers and Ryan, 2006). In addition, the temporary shelters and the humid and crowded living environment where the victims live provide more opportunities for respiratory infections. For example, it was reported in some studies that the humid and crowded living environment were risk factors for tuberculosis (Dheda et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Our results indicate that an increased risk of Japanese encephalitis and leptospirosis was significantly associated with floods in the multivariate analysis models. One Chinese study has confirmed that exposure to floods can increase the incidence of Japanese encephalitis (Zhang et al., 2016). As we know, stagnant water provides a breeding ground for many vectors, such as mosquitoes. This situation can result in an increase of the vector population and potential for disease transmission (Watson et al., 2007). A certain amount of precipitation during the floods not only provides the medium for breeding but also increases the relative humidity that enhances the longevity of adult mosquitoes, which in turn facilitates the transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus to humans (Bi et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2016). Considering the incubation periods of the virus in the mosquito and the human, the lagged time of 0 ten-day periods between floods and increased Japanese encephalitis transmission is not biologically feasible. Therefore, we also assume that the floods could indirectly affect the intermediate stage of Japanese encephalitis virus infection through providing proper environmental conditions (i.e., rainfall, humidity and temperature) for activity of adult mosquitoes, rather from the beginning of the infection process (Zhang et al., 2016). There have been reports of flood-associated outbreaks of leptospirosis from a wide range of countries (Ahern et al., 2005). Leptospirosis is caused by pathogenic spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira. Humans usually become infected through contact with water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals, such as rodents, dogs, cattle, pigs and wild animals (Karande et al., 2003). Leptospirosis has the potential to cause widespread epidemics when large numbers of the population are exposed to wet conditions for prolonged periods (Sehgal et al., 2002). Floods may result in the scattering of garbage, debris and food that may contribute to the amplification of rodent populations. Animal displacement commonly occurs during periods of floods. Displaced domesticated animals, rats, pigs, cattle and reptiles often result in contaminating floodwaters. Therefore, when flood victims were in anti-flood rescue, they directly or indirectly come into contact with contaminated water and then be infected by spirochaetes.",

Secondly, not all environmental factors were considered for analysing the risk of infectious diseases caused by floods. For example, the information about human activities, socioeconomic status, availability of health services, environmental hygiene and the activity and numbers of vector habitats was not available from our data sources and thus could not be included in this analysis. In addition, we chose only ten study sites in southern China to identify flood-sensitive infectious diseases.
