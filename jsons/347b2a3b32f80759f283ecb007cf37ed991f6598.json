Historical laboratory methods, including direct analysis of clinical specimens by transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and inoculation of cultured cells for recovery of infectious viruses have largely been supplanted by rapid immunoserologic and molecular methods that provide definitive answers in as little as a few hours or less. Despite their waning presence in clinical laboratories, these historical methods remain important for the detection and characterization of rare or new viruses and for basic virology research, among other things. The microscopic examination of fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue and fixed cell concentrates also plays an important role in the diagnosis of many viral infections. The recognition of virus infection-associated tissue architectural and cytologic changes (cytopathic effects) and the judicious use of immunohistochemical methods afford anatomic pathologists the ability to provide clinically meaningful information to healthcare providers regarding the type and extent of a viral infection. Chief among the requirements for optimal visualization of virusinduced histopathology and cytopathology is the procurement of high-quality clinical specimens, such as tissue biopsy specimens and body fluids. Sections of tissue destined for histopathologic examination should immediately be placed into an appropriate fixative (e.g., 10% buffered formalin) and allowed to thoroughly fix prior to processing, staining, and examination. Specimens for other viral diagnostic studies, including viral cultures, may not be possible using formalin-fixed specimens; therefore separate sections of tissue should be submitted in transport media appropriate for the desired test(s). The same general considerations should be given when bodily fluids or exfoliated cell preparations are harvested for cytopathologic analysis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In this chapter, representative photomicrographs of histopathologic and cytopathologic features of several viral infections are presented with brief descriptions of the viruses that cause them.

So far, seven distinct viral genome types are known and, to date, all characterized viruses possess one of these seven types. DNA genomes can exist either as double-stranded (dsDNA), gapped-double-stranded (g-dsDNA), or as single-stranded molecules (ssDNA). RNA genomes can also be double-stranded (dsRNA) or single-stranded (ssRNA). ssRNA genomes are further divided into three distinct types, including negative-sense ssRNA (\u00c0ssRNA), positive-sense ssRNA (+ssRNA), and positive-sense ssRNA that is reverse transcribed into a DNA intermediate (+ssRNA-RT). This generalized system for categorization of viruses is the backbone of the most widely used grouping system for viruses, the Baltimore classification system. Viruses are also formally categorized according to conventional Linnaean taxonomic classification into orders, families, subfamilies, genera, and species. As of this writing and according to the latest virus taxonomy release of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, there are seven accepted orders, 122 families (of which 84 are not assigned to an order), 35 subfamilies, and many genera and species. Most of these viruses are not human pathogens, however. Examples of human viruses categorized according to genome type and formal taxonomic naming are listed in Table 3 .1.

Currently, there are 57 HAdV types spanning seven species (Human mastadenovirus A-G) that belong to the genus Mastadenovirus. Like all members of the family Adenoviridae, HAdV possess monopartite, linear dsDNA genomes that are covalently linked to a terminal protein (TP) at the 5 0 -ends of both DNA strands.

Of the 170 types of HPV currently recognized, only a small subset is associated with head, neck, anal, and genital cancers (e.g., HPV 16, 18, 31, 45).

Nascent particles bud from the cytoplasmic membrane, during which they are enveloped; resulting particles are roughly spherical or filamentous.

Included among this group are the filoviruses (e.g., Ebola virus), flaviviruses (e.g., yellow fever virus), hantaviruses (e.g., Sin Nombre virus), and rabies virus (Figs. 3.27, 3.28, 3.29 and 3.30 3 .29 Numerous hantaviruses are known to cause cardiopulmonary disease and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. In nature, these viruses are carried by rodents such as deer mice, and human infections occur by inhalation of virion-laden aerosols generated by disturbance of rodent excreta. Replication of hantaviruses associated with cardiopulmonary disease occurs within pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, pulmonary macrophages, follicular dendritic cells, and within the vascular endothelium of myocardial capillaries. Cytoplasmic inclusions can be seen within pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, but immunohistochemical staining provides a more specific and reliable means for viral detection. The massive pulmonary edema seen in hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome patients is associated with virus-induced impairment of the pulmonary vascular endothelium. Hantavirus particles are enveloped, measure approximately 80-120 nm in size, and contain a tripartite genome composed of linear -ssRNA molecules. The photomicrograph above is that of an H&E-stained lung section from a nonhuman primate that was experimentally infected with Sin Nombre virus, the hantavirus associated with the 1993 Four Corners region hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome outbreak. Nonhuman primate models provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis and pathology of hantavirus infections, and they also recapitulate the disease processes seen in humans with relatively high fidelity. This photomicrograph shows the intra-alveolar edema and fibrin deposition, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial pneumonitis. Rabies virus is a zoonotic virus that is most frequently transmitted to humans by the bites of infected canids, although a small percentage of human infections result from the bites of other infected carnivores and bats, while an even smaller percentage of infections are transmitted by other means, including through allogeneic tissue transplants received from infected donors. Following inoculation, rabies virus can access the central nervous system via infection of peripheral nerves, which serve as conduits through which rabies virus travels to the brain. Myocytes and presumably other cell types at the site of rabies virus inoculation can also host rabies virus infection, but detection of the virus in these cells is difficult. With the exception of limited tissue necrosis, neuronal loss, and the appearance of characteristic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Negri bodies) within infected neurons, rabies virus induces little pathologic change to infected tissues. Rabies virus is a member of the order Mononegavirales, family Rhabdoviridae, and possesses a -ssRNA within a helical nucleocapsid that forms a bullet-shaped particle that is enveloped during budding through the cytoplasmic membrane. The image above is from an H&E-stained cerebellar section from an adolescent patient that died from rabies.
