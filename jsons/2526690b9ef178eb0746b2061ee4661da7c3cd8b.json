As a matter of fact, this study is the first case series conducted globally using a combination of DOXY-HCQ in COVID-19 patients in nursing home settings. We treated our moderate to severe patients in out-of-hospital settings and prevented hospital transfer in the majority of patients. Naive Indirect Comparison showed a better outcome than the data reported in MMWR (reported on March 26, 2020) 17 from a long-term care facility in King County, Washington where 57% of patients were hospitalized and 22% patients died. This effect can possibly be explained by the anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of DOXY-HCQ.",

            "text": "hospitalization, ICU admissions, and mortality. Recently, various drugs have been experimentally used, and the most promising therapy involves HCQ and/or AZ. However, safety concerns are raised due to the potential side-effects profile of both drugs, particularly when used in combination. A recent open-label French study of only six (6) patients in hospital settings showed limited effectiveness (no clinical outcomes reported) of combination of AZ-HCQ in treatment of COVID-19 patients, within six days of treatment 8 . Subsequently, Raoult et al 17 published another case series of 80 patients in hospital settings with AZ-HCQ combination therapy and all but two patients showed clinical improvement. However, 94% of patients were low-severity patients as evidenced by low (0-4) national early warning score (NEWS). The impact of such combination therapy in a high-risk population like ours is unknown. Another recently published Chinese randomized clinical trial conducted in a hospital setting among 62 patients treated with HCQ for 5 days showed improvement of pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, n=25 of 31 patients) compared with the control group (54.8%, n=17 of 31 patients) 6 . 2 patients showed mild adverse events including rash and headache. Detailed demographics of the patient population were not published, however the mean (SD) age was 44.7 (15.3) yrs., much younger than our",
