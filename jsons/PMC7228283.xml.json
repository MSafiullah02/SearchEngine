Three days after admission to the university hospital (approximately one week after initial hospital admission) the patient developed leukocytosis (14.1 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL), with a left\u2010shifted population of neutrophilic cells, prompting peripheral blood smear evaluation. Mild monocytosis (900/\u03bcL) along with the persistent lymphopenia was also noted. The peripheral blood smear was consistent with a leukoerythroblastic picture with normocytic anemia with occasional nucleated red blood cells (Image 1A), mild anisocytosis, and rare dacrocytes. Schistocytes were absent. Neutrophilia with left shifted myeloid cells, including occasional myelocytes and rare promyelocytes were noted (Image 1B\u2010D). Lymphopenia was confirmed with many smudge cells seen. Platelets were adequate with some large platelets seen.",

Few strains of corona virus are known to cause flu\u2010like upper respiratory illnesses in humans, but the current strain, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, was not known to cause any human illnesses prior to this outbreak. Thus, very little information about COVID\u201019's pathogenic role in humans is known. Other coronaviruses have been previously found responsible for infection in both animals and humans, including the viruses responsible for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS\u2010CoV)\n4\n and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\u2010CoV).\n5\n Most of the patient morbidity and mortality attributable to COVID\u201019 has been reported in Wuhan, China.\n6\n Other patients with symptoms of severe infection have now been reported in South Korea, Italy, German, and Iran among others.

Although we are only reporting the findings of a single patient with COVID\u201019, our aim is to describe the unusual finding of leukoerythroblastosis in this viral infection. We cannot definitively conclude that our findings are secondary to infection with COVID\u201019. However, following clinical improvement, the neutrophilia has resolved with the other blood findings slowly improving. With our description of these findings, it is our hope to avoid additional work\u2010up and diagnostic testing in other patients with COVID\u201019, as well as contribute to our understanding of this novel infection.",
