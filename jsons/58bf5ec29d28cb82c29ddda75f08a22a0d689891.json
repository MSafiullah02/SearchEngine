            "text": "A fructan that acts as an anti-influenza A virus substance was isolated from hot water extract of the green leafy part of a Welsh onion (Allium fistulosum L.). The structure of the fructan was characterised and elucidated by chemical and spectroscopic analyses. The fructan was composed of terminal (21.0%) and 2,1linked b-D-Fruf residues (65.3%) with 1,6-linked b-D-Glcp residues (13.7%). The molecular weight of the polysaccharide and polydispersity was estimated to be 1.5 \u00c2 10 3 and 1.18, respectively. Although the fructan did not show anti-influenza A virus activity in vitro, it demonstrated an inhibitory effect on virus replication in vivo when it was orally administered to mice. In addition, the polysaccharide enhanced the production of neutralising antibodies against influenza A virus. Therefore, the antiviral mechanism of the polysaccharide seemed to be dependent on the host immune system, i.e., enhancement of the host immune function was achieved by the administration of the polysaccharide. From our observations, the fructan from Welsh onions is suggested to be one of the active principles which exert an anti-influenza virus effect.",

Of these, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are responsible for approximately 50-70% of all colds. On the other hand, flu is an acute respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses (serotypes A and B). In particular, influenza A viruses (IFV-As) cause recurrent epidemics with substantial human morbidity and mortality, and are associated with pandemics. In fact, a novel swine-origin IFV-A (H1N1) emerged as the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century (Dawood et al., 2009 ). In addition, H5N1 viruses ('avian flu'), which are also currently circulating, are extremely virulent in humans but have not yet acquired the ability for efficient human-to-human transmission. In order to overcome these respiratory infectious diseases, development of novel methodologies for preventing or curing such 'slight' condition is very important.",

Among them, the Welsh onion (Allium fistulosum L.) is a very popular vegetable in East Asian countries, and it has been recorded as a crude drug in oriental medical dictionaries for abdominal pain and phlegmon. In addition, Welsh onion has been used as a folk remedy for the common cold in Japan.

All experiments were conducted in accordance with the animal experimentation guidelines of the University of Toyama under the permission of the Animal Care Committee at the University of Toyama. Mice (n = 10 per group) were inoculated intranasally with 50 ll of viral suspension (2 \u00c2 10 4 PFU/mouse).

Control mice were treated orally with 0.2 ml of vehicle (H 2 O) alone. Body weight change and mortality were monitored for 14 days after virus inoculation. Blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the lung were individually collected after scarification of the animals at 3 (n = 5) and 14 days (n = 5) p.i.

Although host defence mechanisms are complex, it is known that macrophages are key participants in the function of the innate immune system for responding to the invasion of pathogenic organisms. Thus, we investigated the effects of fructan on the activation of macrophages by measuring NO production which is an antiviral mediator (Akaike & Maeda, 2000) . RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells were incubated with the fructan for 24 h, and NO concentrations in the culture supernatants were measured using the Griess reaction.

In particular, macrophages orchestrate a multitude of antiherpetic actions during the first hour of the attack (Ellermann-Eriksen, 2005) . NO may inhibit the early stages of viral replication, and thus prevent viral spread, promoting viral clearance and recovery of the host. Interestingly, the administration of the fructan induced NO production in RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells. Similarly, a fructan from aged garlic has also been shown to possess stimulatory effects on NO production from macrophages (Chandrashekar et al., 2011) . Our results on NO release from macrophages are similar to those seen with other immunomodulating polysaccharides (Schepetkin & Quinn, 2006) .",
