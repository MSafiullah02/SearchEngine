COVID-19 is not usually transmitted directly to the fetus (Kimberlin and Stagno, 2020). Instead, the maternal inflammatory response to the virus is thought to be the pathogenic mechanism underlying effects on the fetus and its support by the placenta (Brown and Meyer, 2018). Common respiratory infections increase the risk for attention deficit disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia, with relative risks ranging from 1.6 to 2.2 (Mednick et al., 1988; Hornig et al., 2018; Dreier et al., 2016). Higher maternal C-reactive protein (CRP) at the beginning of the second trimester is associated with increased risk of schizophrenia in the offspring (Canetta et al., 2014).",

Most of the 43 mothers with viral respiratory infections rated their symptoms as moderate to severe (N = 36, 84%). These self-ratings of symptom severity correlated with the clinical assessment of infection severity in the prenatal clinic medical record (rho = 0.95, P < 0.001). A comparison group of mothers (N = 53) reported no infections. Maternal CRP and choline levels were determined at 16 weeks in both groups. CRP levels remain elevated for up to 10 days after onset of a viral respiratory infection (Melbye et al., 2004).

Regulation includes duration of attention, enjoyment of quiet play, cuddliness and engagement with parents, and soothability; Surgency includes general level of activity and perceptual sensitivity, pleasure in high-intensity activities, vocal reactivity, and smiling and laughter; Negativity includes fearfulness, sadness, and recovery after exposure to a stressor.",

Inhibitory interneurons are being formed in the hippocampus in this gestational window, when they are most vulnerable to maternal inflammation (Vasistha et al., 2019). Fetal development of inhibitory interneuron function, as measured by cerebral evoked potential inhibition in newborns, is associated with the development of infant attention and other self-regulatory behavior as measured with the IBQ-R Regulation dimension (Freedman et al., 2019).",

There are no normal or abnormal values established, but IBQ-R ratings are significantly related to scores on other rating scales as infants reach early childhood (Putnam et al., 2008). Regulation scores predict the child's ability to succeed in early schooling. Lower IBQ-R Regulation at 1 year of age is associated with decreased reading readiness at age 4 years and with problems in concentration, and conscientiousness in children through 7 years of age (Gartstein et al., 2016; Slobodskaya and Kozlova, 2016). In addition, Regulation modulates the child's Surgency and Negativity to meet cultural expectations as the child develops (Ahadi and Rothbart, 1993). Poor attention and social interactions in early childhood are early signs of psychopathology in individuals who later develop severe mental illness as adults (Rossi et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Maternal immune activation models the inflammatory effect of infection in pregnancy in laboratory models. Mice are injected with double-stranded RNA to mimic viral infection or lipopolysaccharide to mimic bacterial infection (Wu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018). Both insults produce maternal inflammatory responses with increased Interleukin-6 (IL-6) that reaches the fetal brain (Smith et al., 2007). The offspring's behavioral deficits include fearfulness, hyperactivity, and decreased learning. Maternal choline supplementation decreases inflammation from maternal immune activation. Fetal brain IL-6 is decreased, and behavioral effects are reversed (Wu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018). Choline is an agonist at \u03b17-nicotinic receptors, which are expressed in large amounts in both fetal brain and placenta (Frazier et al., 1997; Birnbaum et al., 2014; Lips et al., 2005). CHRNA7, the gene that produces the \u03b17-nicotinic receptor, is expressed in fetal neurons, mescenchymal placental cells, and Hofbauer activated fetal placental macrophages (Lips et al., 2005; Kunii et al., 2015). \u03b17-nicotinic receptors regulate activation of Nuclear Factor-\u03ba\u03b2 (NF-kB) and Protein kinase B (AKT) (Zhang et al., 2018; Freedman, 2014). Choline supplementation alters \u03b17-nicotinic receptor expression in the placenta and activates the nF-kB and AKT pathway (Wu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018). Null mutation of CHRNA7 increases the effect of maternal inflammation and blocks choline's promotion of cerebral development (Wu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2003). The effects of choline supplementation in human pregnancy are also associated with CHRNA7 genotype (Ross et al., 2016).",

Of the four double-blind placebo-controlled studies of choline or phosphatidylcholine supplementation in pregnancy, three have found significant effects on infant cognition or behavior (Ross et al., 2016; Jacobson et al., 2018; Caudill et al., 2018); one did not (Cheatham et al., 2012). None reported serious adverse effects. Two of the studies found positive effects of supplementation in women who were not selected for adverse risk factors such as infection (Ross et al., 2016; Caudill et al., 2018). Daily 6300 mg phosphatidylcholine supplements containing 900 mg choline have been used safely during pregnancy from 15 weeks gestation until delivery with subsequent positive effects on the child's attention and social behavior through 3.5 years of age (Ross et al., 2016). The increased significance of effects in mothers with infection in this study likely represents an interaction between the adverse effect of the infection and the positive effect of higher choline levels.",

CRP levels in this study indicate a wide variance in inflammatory reactions in pregnant women in this study, but the range is similar to the range of CRP levels in Chinese pregnant women who were infected with COVID-19. The key finding of this study is that higher prenatal choline levels are associated with decreased adverse effects on the infant's development if the mother has a moderately severe respiratory virus infection. In conjunction with the CDC's current advice on COVID-19's effects in pregnancy, phosphatidylcholine or choline supplements along with other prenatal vitamins may help buffer the fetal brain from the possible detrimental impact of the current pandemic and decrease the risk of the children's future mental illness.",
