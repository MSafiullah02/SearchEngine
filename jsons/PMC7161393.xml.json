The clinical sign is related to an infectious agent that could pass from the animal to the person, with the animal serving as a source for the zoonotic infection risk. An example may be the direct infection of a person tending a calf with cryptosporidial diarrhea after fecal material splashes directly into the person's mouth. The second is as an environmental sentinel event. The clinical signs of the animal disease provide an indication of an environmental hazard, either infectious or toxic, to which human beings may also be exposed. For example, identification of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in dogs has led to the discovery and treatment of disease in a human patient.1 Similarly, a dog that becomes ill after ingesting toxic berries on an ornamental plant signals a potential danger for children who could inadvertently ingest the berries. Elevated blood lead levels in pets are an indicator of lead exposure risk in children living nearby.",

The relevance to animal health professionals of a particular disease or symptom in human beings can be classified into several categories:\u2022\nZoonotic disease acquired from an animal. This may necessitate referral of a person to a health care provider, evaluation of suspect animal(s), and a review of hygienic and biosafety practices and other preventive measures. Immunocompromised persons (e.g., from chemotherapy, chronic debilitation) are at increased risk of severe complications from a zoonotic disease, and there is consequently a need for increased vigilance to prevent zoonotic transmission from a pet-related infection such as diagnosing and treating any animal infections and reviewing infection hygienic practices.\u2022\nReverse zoonoses (disease passing from the human to the animal). This could require screening the animal for infection as well as ensuring that the human being receives appropriate treatment and review of infection control practices and prevention measures.\u2022\nPotential environmental sentinel event. Signaling a risk of biological, chemical, or physical hazards in the environment to which animals or other people may also be exposed and at risk. This should initiate a search for the environmental hazard, examination of the animal(s) to see whether corollary disease is present, notification of the health department and/or state veterinarian's office, if indicated, and consideration of ways to reduce the environmental risk. This category includes allergic disease, neglect, and domestic violence. These possibilities are summarized in Figure 4-3\n.\n",
