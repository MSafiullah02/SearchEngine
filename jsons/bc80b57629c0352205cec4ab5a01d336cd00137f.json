            "text": "American Born Chinese is the most celebrated text to date in a growing sub-genre of Asian American alternative comics (see Sabin (1993 Sabin ( , 1996 and Hatfield (2005) for more on alternative comics). Other Asian American alternative comics include Yang's Gordon Yamamoto and the King of the Geeks (2004a), Loyola Chin and the San Peligran Order (2004b), Tak Toyoshima's Secret Asian Man (1999 Man ( -2010 , Adrian Tomine's Summer Blonde (2003) , Derek Kirk Kim's Same Difference and Other Stories (2004) and Good as Lily (2007), Thien Pham's Sumo (2012) , GB Tran's Vietnamerica (2011) and the collection Secret Identities: The Asian American Superhero Anthology (2009). I will argue that the Asian American alternative comics sub-genre, alongside the popularity of Japanese manga in America since the 1990s, and the increasing visibility of Asian and Asian American creators has coincided with (and perhaps contributed to) progressive depictions of Asians and Asian Americans in American comics. Yang's American Born Chinese embodies many of the progressive aspects of Asian American alternative comics by destabilising concepts of an undifferentiated Asian monoculture. It explores various historical and modern Asian cultures, Asian American identities, and the forms of racism which have been directed toward Asian Americans.",

            "text": "American Born Chinese draws upon a range of literary and linguistic sources. It blends pop culture with classical Chinese literature in a collage of Chinoiserie and Japonism. Yang references the 20th-century Japanese American animation both to provide a recurring metaphor for the text and to explore the multiplicity and cohesion of Asian American identities. He draws upon the 19th-and 20th-century American comics in his exploration of the history of racism toward Asians and Asian Americans. This paper will offer a synthesis and critique of the existing academic literature on American Born Chinese around these themes. It also continues the historical accounts offered by Fu (2007) and Gardner (2010) The stereotypes which Chin-Kee embodies are numerous and contradictory. He speaks broken English, and yet he knows specialised English terms (Smith 2013, online) . These contradictory stereotypes reflect the many ways in which Chinese immigrants have been imagined in American popular culture. During the 19th-century newspaper, cartoons depicted the Chinese as animal-like and violent (see Fig. 3 and Choy et al. 's Coming Man (1994) ). Early American newspapers such as The Wasp (1842-1843) featured racist caricatures of Asians in keeping with this mythology. These early cartoons depicted Chinese immigrants with slits for eyes, wearing coolie outfits and with ponytails. For Fu, Chin-Kee serves as 'an effective way to dispel the century-old image of the \"Heathen Chinese\" ' (Fu 2006, 276) .",

Examples include Smash Comics character Wun Cloo (Smith 2013, online) , the recurring Marvel villain The Yellow Claw and the DC character Chop Chop (Yang 2008, online) . These characters were more wily than their previous incarnations and some even occupied the role of the protagonist, but their caricatured features and coolie dress had changed little since the 1880s. Colour printing also expanded the cartoon language to include sallow skin as an Asian signifier. Yang appropriates this language for Chin-Kee and, to a lesser extent, for Jin (see Boatright 2010, 473) . During World War II, racist depictions of Japanese soldiers in comic books shared a visual language with anti-Japanese propaganda posters (see Dong 2011, 243) . These comics blended and confused all Asians under the generic stereotype of the Oriental man who, amongst other misdeeds, imprisons and sells women (see Fig. 1 ). 2 Chin-Kee, in keeping with this mythology, drools over American women and wishes to bind their feet (Yang 2006, 50) .",

These stereotypes have roots in the 19th-century depictions of the Chinese (see Choy et al. (1994) for examples). Gardner describes modern depictions of Asian Americans as 'mechanised alien robots' (Gardner 2010, 135) . These stereotypes appear most often, he argues, in school newspapers. Yang's Chin-Kee embarrasses his cousin by knowing the answer to every question posed in class (Yang 2006, 111-113) . The most disturbing aspect of Chin-Kee is his similarity to certain modern, and unironically racist, depictions of Asian Americans in political cartoons and televised media. The reference to 'Clispy fried cat gizzard' (Yang 2006, 114) quotes a 2001 editorial cartoon by Pat Oliphant (see Gardner 2010, 132) . Chin-Kee's performance of 'She Bangs' references the performance by Asian American singer William Hung (see Fu 2007, 275; Vizzini 2007, online) . One high schooler is afraid that Chin-Kee's spit will infect him with the SARS virus (Yang 2006, 202) .",

The Monkey King is haunted by the disdain of immortals and gods; he refuses his monkey nature and transforms himself into 'The Great Sage, Equal of Heaven'. At the end of the comic, Wei-Chen adopts a flamboyant style of dress which serves as an armour against racist caricatures. In all three cases, 'Yang's characters themselves attempt to bend their own race into something less offensive/more palatable to the racists who populate their daily environments' (Hahne nd. online).",

The Monkey King, for Fu, offers a Chinese alternative to the superheroes who have dominated the pages of American comic books. Fu's argument is problematic given that the American comic book is a medium which has historically been used to explore the immigrant experience. Superman, the prototypical superhero, is an immigrant, having travelled from Krypton to Earth (see Dooley and Engle 1988) . Like Stan Lee (Leiber), and Jack Kirby (Kurzberg), and like Jin/Danny, a recurring characteristic of the superhero genre is the second identity adopted by a hero in order to survive in American society.

Indeed, as shall now be discussed, Yang uses his medium as a means to explicitly challenge racist stereotypes. The most sustained reference in American Born Chinese is to the story of the Monkey King. The original Journey to the West is a mythical story of how Buddhism came to China from India. Dong asserts that Yang follows in the tradition of many American storytellers who have 'adapted or alluded to the story of the Monkey King and altered his character as well as the story line for their respective political and critical agendas' (Dong 2011, 234) . Yang adapts the tale of the Monkey King not only into a story of self-discovery but also into a Judeo-Christian story. Tze-Yo-Tzuh, who imprisons the Monkey King, is Yang's creation and is more similar to an Abrahamic deity than any figure from Buddhist or Taoist traditions (Vizzini 2007, online) . The story of Journey to the West, in Yang's telling, becomes the story of the Magi (the three kings) who bring gifts to the baby Jesus, signified by the shining star which the Monkey King and Lai-Tsao walk toward (Vizzini 2007, online). Yang has described Christianity as 'the world that I'm a little more familiar with' compared with Chinese religious traditions (Yang in Morton 2010, online) . 4 Yang's blend of Chinese and Western mythologies fuses cultural codes and introduces the theme of transformation into the text. It also serves to destabilise concepts of a monolithic Asian culture by providing an introduction to Chinese mythology. Yang uses these references to distinguish between historical Chinese culture and modern Asian American identities.",

Doughty reads this doubled language as a dramatisation of the internal struggle between Jin/Danny's Chinese and American racialised identities. Chin-Kee, the Chinese blood relative, is the key who can unlock Danny and transform him back into Jin. The repeated strikes which Chin-Kee delivers to Danny's face (and Wei-Chen delivers to Jin's face) represents Jin's internal struggle to come to terms with his own racial identity. Doughty's analysis omits the usual rendering of the English name Danny into Chinese 'big inside/within'. Beneath Danny's seemingly unremarkable White face is a chaotic internal world. On the surface, he appears to be a member of America's racial and religious majority, but on the inside, he struggles to reconcile his American and Chinese identities.",

When Jin arrives at Mayflower Elementary School (a reference, Dong contends, to the Mayflower pilgrim settlement in 1620), he meets Japanese American classmate Suzy Nakamura. Despite differences in language and culture, and a history of tension between Japan and China, Jin's classmates initially assume that the two are related and, later, that they are engaged to be married. As a result, Jin and Suzy spend much of their early years avoiding one another.",

When the teacher tells the class that Wei-Chen is from China, he asserts that he is from Taiwan. The scene doubles the panel in which Jin is introduced to the class and corrects the teacher by asserting that he is from San Francisco, not China. Jin feels an immediate and inexplicable desire to bully Wei-Chen when they first meet. Jin's instant dislike of Wei-Chen reflects both his racial self-hatred and the question, Doughty contends, of Taiwan's political status. Like every other Asian identity in the text, Wei-Chen's Taiwanese identity is not fixed. After Jin makes a failed attempt to kiss Suzy, Wei-Chen's anger is exacerbated by his belief that he and Jin are family. The scene, Doughty contends, reverses the argument often made by certain voices in mainland China that the majority of people who reside in Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestry.",

The insistence of the weak Asian male identity which Chin-Kee forces upon Danny is paralleled by Wei-Chen's over-performed masculine identity at the end of the book.

His street racer/taike identity is supported by his refusal to speak in English. Cheney contends that Wei-Chen takes on the trappings of American Hip Hop culture and thus a style of dress which is more commonly associated with certain African American, rather than Asian American, cultures. Cheney asserts that Wei-Chen's Hip Hop accessories serve to emphasise the degree to which his identity is a performance.

Gardner somewhat overstates his case, however, when he claims that 'comics make impossible [\u2026] unequivocal meanings, and a stable definition of us and them' (Gardner 2010, 142) and that 'the sequential comic is the most powerful [\u2026] medium for embracing the radical consequences of an alterity that disables stereotypes and easy readings of the hegemonic gaze' (Gardner 2010, 147) . If understood as a totalising statement, it is hard to reconcile Gardner's argument with images of Captain America doing battle with Middle Eastern terrorists in the Enemy arc (Cassaday and Rieber 2002a) , a fight which is clearly founded upon concepts of 'us and them' and supported with racist cartoon language. It is also hard to make a case that second-generation Shoah survivor Art Spiegelman's satirical entries for the 2002 Iranian Anti-Semitic cartoon competition fail to complicate racist editorial cartoons because he uses single static images rather than a series of static images (see Spiegelman 2011, 102-103) .",

The irony of Yang's postmodern play with older literary forms may be lost on a readership who have had little exposure to the works he references.

Chin-Kee's presence in Danny's life (and in the text as a whole) illustrates the damage which these stereotypes wreak in the lives of Asian Americans. For Fu and Vizzini, it is the racism of the White characters which is most deserving of attention: '[m]ore disquieting than Chin-Kee himself is the reaction of his American peers. They accept him with blank, idealized political correctness.' (Vizzini 2007, online) . The most harmful violence depicted in the text is not the exaggerated racist caricature Chin-Kee but Danny's classmates who make squinty eyes at when the Asian characters look away. Dong asserts that '[t]he very first morning, though well intentioned, [Jin's] teacher mispronounces his name, misidentifies his origin, and promotes stereotypes about people of Chinese heritage' (Dong 2011, 238) . The Asian American characters arrange their identities around this racism. Danny, Davis argues, is 'haunted by the (literal) spectre of the Asian stereotype' (Davis 2011, 280) . American Born Chinese alerts readers to the ways in which racism has become something performed in whispers to one side or hidden behind a veneer of political correctness and betrayed by slips of speech. The damage of such stereotypes is not that they are used as a weapon against ethnic minorities but that they may be internalised by members of those groups. Jin, Davis argues, 'is a victim of the pervasiveness of racial stereotypes; he suffers from the consequences of their existence at the same time that he accepts them' (Davis 2011, 280 ). Yang's American Born Chinese, alongside the works of his contemporaries, serves as a means to challenge and exorcise the now subtle racism toward Asians and Asian Americans.",

One might argue that Yang's simplistic message (that Asian Americans should accept who they are) fails to match the brilliance of his postmodern historiography of Asian and Asian American identities. In defiance of his moral, Yang makes clear that, for Asian Americans, the issue of 'who you are' is in a state of constant reinvention. Future analysis may challenge and celebrate Yang's message. 5 The existing scholarship on American Born Chinese signals a need for greater recognition of the growing visibility of Asian characters in contemporary comic books and other American media. The examples given throughout this essay are far from exhaustive. Future scholars may consider the Singaporean superhero Jenny Quantum of the Wildstorm Universe and European comic books such as Glyn Dillon's The Nao of Brown (2012). The exorcism of the 'coolie' and the 'yellow peril' from modern American popular culture is still a work in progress, but some hope exists. Comic book creators are increasingly sensitive to the damaging effect of stereotypes, and many are involved in actively reinventing the role of Asians and Asian Americans in American media.",

One tied women up and sold them at slave auctions; the other revered them and placed them on pedestals. (Kabanni 1986, 79) These images have historically served to legitimise colonial rhetoric, inspire of Asian men, and, in the context of World War II comics, to cast the American soldiers in the role of heroes and saviours. 3 The hero who first did battle with the Yellow Claw was not a White man but Jimmy Woo, a character who continues to appear in Marvel comics. Early appearances by Jimmy Woo are, by modern standards, still problematic, but Marvel's decision to lead with an Asian hero was unusual for the time in any popular American medium. 4 The blend of Chinese mythical history with Western spirituality is to be repeated in Yang's Boxers & Saints (2013) , which tells the story of China's 1900 Boxer Rebellion in one volume and the story of a young woman's conversion to Catholicism in the second. 5 Future research might also expand upon Cheney's aside which draws a connection between the Monkey King and Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s work on the Signifyin(g) Monkey. Critics may read Chin-Kee's repetition of racist caricatures as a double-voiced occupation of a White sign. Gardner and Dong both come close to such a reading without drawing explicitly from Gates' critical terminology.",
