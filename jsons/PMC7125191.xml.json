Not as catastrophic as originally feared, Influenza A, which is genetically close to the Spanish flu of the early 20th century, caused 284,000 deaths1, while Ebola caused 11,300 deaths2. The Influenza epidemics, particularly, proved that a highly contagious new virus could rapidly spread to all continents of the earth in less than a year.

The mathematical modeling of dynamical processes on networks has, in the recent years, produced an abundance of results that help to unravel the complexities of epidemic waves and predict the outcomes and risks of transmitting diseases4\u20137. Thus, the physical theory of percolation on networks8 was mapped to the spreading of diseases9. This knowledge has been used to determine transmission rates for which a disease becomes endemic10 by relating the critical infection rate to the threshold of percolation on networks. Moreover, effective immunization strategies to fight the spreading of a disease have been found by identifying individual nodes that should be made immune based on certain network measures7.",

With it, individual nodes are connected frequently in their local spatial areas11,12, yet they are also connected to distant nodes via a small number of intermediated nodes. Transport networks, which are common substrates for infection spreading, were found to possess the small-world property; particularly those that developed in modern times. For instance, for the spread of human diseases it may be important that individuals fly long distances by plane, which makes the human transport grid to be of small-world type13. Similarly, transmission networks of viruses such as the West Nile virus, which are transmitted in short-range by mosquitos and long-range by birds14, likely exhibit the small-world property.",

This particularly holds for epidemics where spatial relations between hosts (e.g., transport between villages, city, or countries) are relevant. Importantly, it was found that generally small-worldness lowers the threshold for percolation and thus also promotes the global contagion on networks with this property5. We here built on this earlier modeling work for epidemics on small-world networks. We assume a network of nodes which are inhabited by individuals (hosts of the pathogen). Because of transport of individuals between nodes, infecting agents can travel with them to a connected node and infect the node\u2019s community. This process is modeled here by the established Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model in which, for simplicity, individuals at each node are collectively in one of three states: susceptible (S), infected (I), or recovered or removed (R).",

Viruses have very high mutation rates15 and several mutations can accumulate leading to substantial displacements in their genotype. In fact, mutation rates are so high that the evolution of a virus is interacting with its epidemiological behavior16. We here investigate the case that pathogens, by a series of random mutations, undergo changes of their genes that affect their infection or transmission probability. Such mutations of the infectivity occur for instance during adaptation to new environments or as response to antiviral or antibiotic drugs17. Recently, the possibility that an adaptive mutation during the West African Ebola epidemic increased transmission between humans was described18,19.",

We find that in networks without small-world links, the probability of an escape to the supercritical state remains small, even if the mutation probability is large. In contrast, if small-world links are present, a supercritical mutation occurs frequently even for moderate mutation rate. The genetic change then entails a transition to a supercritical infection probability, which in turn causes a global infection of almost all nodes of the network. In contrast to the former case of epidemics assisted by small-world links, we here obtain a regime with a high chance of complete infestation of the host species due to the escape process driven by mutations. For larger numbers of long-range links, i.e., for networks approaching the global mixing of random graphs, the sweeping outbreaks disappear again.",

The value of \u03bb is determined by the states \u03b3 of the infected nodes connected to a susceptible node, see Fig. 1b.

Given the phylogenetic data for instance for the case of Ebola epidemic in 2013-2016, it appears that the genetic variability of the entire virus population of the outbreak is much larger than the variability at each infection site or country30. Following this line of thought we consider the limit in which establishment of a strain at each node occurs quickly, so that the local population is collectively characterized by a single virus strain. We will study two scenarios, one for pathogens requiring a small number of mutational steps for adaptation and one for pathogens requiring a large number of steps, where a continuous approximation may be valid:",

However, as a consequence of the mutations, the infection probability changes and enables more substantial evolutions of the epidemic.

This means that in a given run the infection either hits the giant component at, e.g., 50% of all nodes, or the contagion dies out.

SI Appendix, Fig. S1 shows that the probability for supercritical mutations is much smaller for a local network (without short-cuts) even if the mean size of the infected clusters is similarly large as in the small-world case. This suggests that increasing the number of long links in the network helps the mutations by way of (i) increasing the percolation cluster (i.e., lowering the percolation threshold) and (ii) by lifting local blocking of mutated nodes. Thus, we conclude that, besides the increasing percolation cluster, it is the topology of the small-world network that drives the occurrence of mutations and global epidemics in our continuous model.",

The escape to the potentially disastrous supercritical regime is facilitated by a small number of long-range links on the spatial grid of hosts.

In this situation, the non-mutated type indeed covers large parts of the network before the supercritical pathogens can propagate.

In this way the development of isolated regions of the network, where the mutation can proceed without competition, is diminished. Second, after a supercritical pathogen has established, one needs to prevent spreading by removal of links around the supercritical nucleation site. Third, it is also conceivable, that, depending on the topology, an increase of p can result in the spreading of the non-mutated form, thus preventing the infection by the mutated form.

Potentially this question might also determine the chances of a severe mutation of the Ebola virus from a droplet to an airborne transmission route35. It has been argued that within-host selectivity provides a much quicker adaptation than between-host selectivity since the time-scale of selectivity is much shorter within a host than between hosts. In the context of our study, the within-host scenario is one of well-mixed dynamics (large p, see Fig. 4a), where we found a domination of the non-mutated form. Only for intermediate small-worldness do we find the mutated form to be competitive. Our results suggest that the decisive mutation benefits from the small-worldness and may thus arise during the epidemic wave on a network with the suitable properties.
