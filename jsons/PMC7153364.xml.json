Clinicians and clinician-researchers provided the model developers on the data science team with insight into the model inputs and assumptions most subject to variation or inaccuracy and provided adequate ranges of plausible estimates. Through a series of discussions and iterative development of the Web-based tool, CHIME was developed to be as simple as possible while providing actionable information for high-stakes decisions in preparing for the expected COVID-19 epidemic in our region.",

By specifying values of initial disease prevalence, population size, time to recovery, and transmission rate, the SIR model makes deterministic predictions about the number of future infections over time. First, on the basis of published case series from China and other regions reporting on the clinical course of observed patients early in the epidemic (15\u201318) and local information about the regional population (Table 1) served at the 3 hospitals in our health system, we used the SIR framework to model the number and rate of infections in the regional population. Next, we extended these projections of the total number of cases to estimate the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who would require hospital resources (hospitalizations, ICU care, invasive mechanical ventilation). We then conducted a Monte Carlo simulation instantiation of an SIR model with a 1-day cycle with 1000 draws from probability distributions of model parameters. The Supplement (available at Annals.org) provides the details of the equations and parameters underlying the CHIME SIR model.",

Given substantial uncertainty regarding input parameters for more complicated models and the need to communicate and iterate rapidly with decision makers, we opted not to incorporate more transition states to model infection severity, social networks to model transmission dynamics, or geographic information to account for spatial patterns of human interaction. We recognize that these approaches could offer greater fidelity to known epidemic dynamics but would have come at the cost of slower development, be less clinically intuitive or interpretable, and have greater uncertainty in model inputs.",

We used aggregate counts of existing capacity across the 3 hospitals to accommodate anticipated resource allocation and patient diversions between hospitals (18).

This may be particularly important in the case of COVID-19, because of rapidly shifting regional policies on physical distancing, school and university closures, cancellation of public gatherings, and shelter-in-place advisories. Although we could not account for these dynamics directly in the model itself, differences in rates of interpersonal contact and disease transmission attributable to physical distancing policies were indirectly modeled through the broad range of doubling times used in our sensitivity analyses. In particular, the mass action mixing assumption in CHIME, in which all members of the population are assumed to mix homogeneously with each other, may overestimate the final size of the epidemic (26) as well as produce a steeper decline in cases after peak (27).",

Modeling only the needs for patients with COVID-19 would cause these projections to underestimate the total true demand on health system resources. However, other phenomena may cause our approach to over- or underestimate the true demand, including the possibility of different regional outbreaks of COVID-19, varying demand for non\u2013COVID-19-related hospital services with elimination of elective cases, and disruption of usual outpatient care for patients with acute and chronic illnesses. We also expect that the role of suburban hospitals may change as they manage local cases of COVID-19 in less densely populated areas or serve as a reservoir of ICU capacity as regionalization policies seek to offload strain from urban hospitals. These uncertainties will be incorporated into subsequent versions of CHIME as epidemic patterns and local care practices emerge in the coming weeks.",

We will also continue to use data that accrue on the local level to inform iterative model revisions. In addition, we plan to validate the model projections presented here to inform hospital planning strategies in the event of future epidemics. Each day, we will update time-varying parameters, such as the number of cases reported by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the number of infected patients within our health system, to make predictions about future hospital demand at 7-, 14-, 28-, and 56-day time horizons. As we monitor the epidemic progress in real time, including expected changes in the doubling time, we will then assess the performance of these predictions for hospital, ICU bed, and ventilator demand, at each week by using the mean-squared error.",

Thus, CHIME should not be used for estimating the latter types of needs.
