Such large-scale incursion into privacy and data protection is unthinkable during times of normalcy. However, in times of a pandemic the use of location data provided by telecom operators and/or technology companies becomes a viable option. Importantly, legal regulations hardly protect people's privacy against governmental and corporate misuse. Established privacy regimes are focused on individual consent, and most human rights treaties know derogations from privacy and data protection norms for states of emergency. This leaves little safeguards nor remedies to guarantee individual and collective autonomy. However, the challenge of responsible data use during a crisis is not novel. The humanitarian sector has more than a decade of experience to offer. International organisations and humanitarian actors have developed detailed guidelines on how to use data responsibly under extreme circumstances. This article briefly addresses the legal gap of data protection and privacy during this global crisis. Then it outlines the state of the art in humanitarian practice and academia on data protection and data responsibility during crisis.",

Since the virus gained international attention after its rapid spread in Hubei province in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in December 2019, it subsequently appeared in other Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan. While some might argue that it was na\u00efve of the 'Western World' to consider this crisis as a predominantly Asian problem for too long, the shutdown of large parts of society in practically all European countries and increasingly the rest of the world has made clear that this is a global crisis that affects all of us for much longer than expected. In this situation strong and decisive measures to save the lives and livelihoods of people across all parts of the world are needed.",

Amongst others, Big data, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology can concretely help to deal with this emergency . For example, location data from mobile phone companies can help in determining and understanding movement patterns of individuals and groups to potentially give insight into how the virus spreads and whether instructions are complied with . Governments and private corporations are developing apps that allow users to share their whereabouts and social contacts on a voluntary basis (Google Is Now Publishing Coronavirus Mobility Reports, Feeding off Users n.d.; Baharudin and Wong 2020) ; Experts Warn of Privacy Risk as US Uses GPS to Fight Coronavirus Spread 2020). Blockchain technology might be able to help keep a decentralised and cryptographically secure ledger of stocks and medication to create smart supply chain management (Zwitter and Boisse-Despiaux 2018) . VR can help teachers explore new avenues of digital classrooms with new ways of interaction (Checa and Bustillo 2020) . Nevertheless, as promising as the use of these emerging technologies might be, it is important to note that their use comes with a digital footprint that invariably has consequences for data protection and privacyon a global scale (Zwitter 2015) . Furthermore, political and corporate players might use the current situation to justify more intrusive data use for the future and for times after the pandemic is over.",

The insights presented by this app are based on the analysis of location data collected through phone networks, WiFi connections, satellite-based radio navigation system (e.g. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo) and other surveillance assemblages producing data that reveal the location of individuals and crowds. Furthermore, apps with maps to track the disease also became popular very quickly in Hong Kong (Latest Situation of Novel Coronavirus Infection in Hong Kong n.d.), and South Korea (Coronavirus Mobile Apps Are Surging in popularity in South Korea -CNN n.d.). In the PRC, this approach seems to have evolved into the 'Alipay Health Code', a system that classifies residents based on an opaque methodology (Mozur et al. 2020) . Once a survey has been filled out by a user, this data gets combined with other sources such as location data. Once the data has been analysed, a QR code is generated which has one of three colours; green enables its bearer to unrestricted movement, the 'owner' of a yellow code may be asked to stay home for 7 days, and a red QR code results in two-weeks of quarantine.",

Undoubtedly, in times of crisis there is an increased need for governments to monitor and control the public, which might make it necessary to limit individual freedom. Such decisionism characterizes many emergencies. Constitutions and human rights, however, are designed with such crises in mind. Furthermore, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and on the European level the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), are prepared to deal with such situations. Considering such developments from a formal perspective, it is useful to take a look at the legal and institutional framework of the Council of Europe (CoE). This international organization administers and controls one of the most important international human rights treaties guaranteeing individual freedoms, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The CoE has established procedures and case-law for times of crisis like the current one (Mokhtar 2004 ). Furthermore, Article 4 of the ICCPR is similarly worded and beyond that requires state parties to report to all other parties via the UN Secretariat. Certain rights such as the right to life (except in respect of deaths resulting from lawful acts of war), the prohibition of torture and other forms of ill-treatment, the prohibition of slavery or servitude, and the rule of no punishment without law are non-derogable. However, many other rights are subject to derogation, including particularly the right to privacy, freedom of expression, the freedom of movement, as well as the freedom of assembly and association. Such derogations may only be of temporary nature (Zwitter 2012) . Both of these legal frameworks allow states for some flexibility by enabling them to temporarily derogate from some rights.",

Only mentioning the issue of over-dominant corporate power in the form of surveillance capitalism briefly (Zuboff 2019) , data ownership is in principle a matter of contract law and in many cases a question of terms of use that customers have to accept by default when intending to use a service. Particularly now, private corporations hold the key to using Big Data for tackling the corona crisis. Furthermore, typical data protection frameworks such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are focused on individual rights and individual consent.

The right to protection concerns protection from all harms that can arise from the misuse and unintended consequences of data and ICTs, given that crisis-affected populations are particularly vulnerable. Privacy and security as a right refers to internationally recognised legal, ethical and technical standards of data protection and privacy. The right to data agency relates to individual and collective agency with regards to collection, use and disclosure of PII and DII. Finally, rectification and redress of data is also a remedy that pertains to groups and individuals. A key element in all these points is not only the abstract existence and observance of these rights, but to enable effective application procedures for individuals and populations affected by crises. In other words, it obliges humanitarians to establish procedures to give effect to these rights and potential claims of affected people.",

In the absence of such clear and democratically legitimized norms, one can only resort to fundamental rights provisions such as Article 8 paragraph 2 of the ECHR that reminds us that any infringement of rights such as privacy need to be in accordance with law, necessary in a democratic society, pursuing a legitimate objective and proportionate in their application.",

Hence, it is not a question of whether, but when. Therefore, organisations have to prepare sound data retention and deletion policies. data ethics is an obligation to provide high quality analysis; using machine learning and big data might be appealing for the moment, but the quality of source data might be low, and results might be unreliable, or even harmful. Biases in incomplete datasets, algorithms and human users are abundant and widely discussed.
