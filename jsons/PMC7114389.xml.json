            "text": "Viral infections of the respiratory tract represent a major problem for human and animal health around the world. These respiratory infections induce the most common illnesses (Vareille et al., 2011) and are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide, especially children, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals (Cesario, 2012, Ison and Hayden, 2002, Jartti et al., 2012, Sloots et al., 2008). The idea that viruses can cause respiratory tract infections has been demonstrated since the early 1930s (Jartti et al., 2012). Nevertheless, with the help of modern diagnostic tools, a significant number of new respiratory viruses have been discovered since the beginning of the 21st century and it is estimated that there are about 200 antigenically distinct viruses able to cause infection of the respiratory tract, especially in infants and children (Brouard et al., 2007). In fact, it is now believed that viruses cause 95% of respiratory diseases in children and infants and about 30\u201340% in the elderly (Jartti et al., 2012). Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals. Most of the coronaviruses that infect human beings usually reach the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with symptoms of common colds. However, being opportunistic pathogens, they can also affect the lower respiratory tract in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, where they can lead to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Raj et al., 2014, Vabret et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Even though the airway epithelial cells of the respiratory tract represent a first line of defense against pathogens, they can become a target for infection by several different respiratory viruses, as a way for them to penetrate the human host. Several infections of epithelial cells, including those that involve coronaviruses, are self-limited and the infection remains local as the virus will be cleared by the immune system in the respiratory tract, with minimal clinical consequences. However, in some circumstances, opportunistic viral pathogens like the human coronaviruses can avoid the immune response and cause more severe respiratory diseases (Vareille et al., 2011) or even spread to other tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS), where they could induce other types of pathologies (McGavern and Kang, 2011). Human coronaviruses are molecularly related in structure and mode of replication with neuroinvasive animal coronaviruses (Brian and Baric, 2005) such as PHEV (porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus) (Greig et al., 1962), FCoV (feline coronavirus) (Foley et al., 2003), and MHV (mouse hepatitis virus) (Lampert et al., 1973), which have all been shown to invade the CNS and induce different types of neuropathologies. The MHV, represents the best described case of coronaviruses involved in neurological diseases and several excellent reviews have highlighted the importance of both viral and host factors in the process (Bender and Weiss, 2010, Cowley and Weiss, 2010, Hosking and Lane, 2010). MHV can also persist in the mouse CNS and induce a chronic demyelinating disease, which is partially immune-mediated, similar to what is observed in multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans (Hosking and Lane, 2010, Weiss and Leibowitz, 2011). Therefore, the close structural and biological relatedness of human coronaviruses to the neurotropic animal coronaviruses has led to speculation about possible involvement of human coronaviruses in neurological diseases. Because they are themselves also naturally neuroinvasive in humans and mice, a possible association between the presence of ubiquitous human coronaviruses in the establishment or the exarcerbation of neurological human pathologies has over the years been suggested.",

Since the SARS outbreak of 2002, research on coronaviruses have entered a new era, which led to the identification of several new coronaviruses, including three that infect humans. Namely, they are HCoV-NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004) in the genus Alphacoronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, which is part of the Betacoronavirus genus (Woo et al., 2005) and more recently, MERS-CoV, a newly identified Betacoronavirus (Zaki et al., 2012).",

Most of the times, they infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with rhinitis, laryngitis or otitis but, as opportunistic pathogens, in more vulnerable populations such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, they can also reach the lower respiratory tract, where they could instead be associated with bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome (Talbot et al., 2008, Vabret et al., 2009).",

Furthermore, a typical pathological portrait of the respiratory tract showed edema, hemorrhage and congestion of the lungs, as well as pleural effusion in the thoracic cavity associated with infiltration of immune cells (van den Brand et al., 2014).

            "text": "Recently, in the fall of 2012, ten years after the SARS episode, a SARS-like disease affected individuals that traveled from the Arabian Peninsula to the United Kingdom. Using molecular sequencing, it was rapidly shown that this new respiratory coronavirus was genetically different than SARS-CoV and it is now recognized that the new epidemic is caused by a new coronavirus from the genus Betacoronavirus (Zaki et al., 2012), that was first named HCoV-EMC (for Human Coronavirus \u2013 Erasmus Medical Center), human betacoronavirus 2c and NcoV or nCoV (for novel Coronavirus), and that is now known under the official name MERS-CoV: Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (Coleman and Frieman, 2013, de Groot et al., 2013), which is the etiologic agent of a severe lower respiratory tract infection that resembles SARS and which can be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and possible renal failure (Raj et al., 2014). Like other coronaviruses that infect humans, MERS-CoV most likely originated from bats before infecting an intermediary reservoir (probably the dromedary camel in that case), and thus represents a zoonotic transmission to humans. However, human to human transmission has now been demonstrated in several cases (Assiri et al., 2013b, Haagmans et al., 2014, Raj et al., 2014). As of September 18th, 2014, the Public Health Agency of Canada revealed that the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that the MERS-CoV has spread to at least twenty-one different countries, where 841 laboratory-confirmed cases of individuals (including 402 between April 11 and June 9, 2014 in Saudi Arabia alone) have been identified as infected by the MERS-CoV, with 298 being fatal (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2014). As do the four circulating strains of HCoV (Cabeca et al., 2013, Vabret et al., 2009), both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV usually induce more (Assiri et al., 2013a, Hui et al., 2014) severe illnesses in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, infants, immune-compromised individuals or patients with comorbidities (Peiris et al., 2004, Vabret et al., 2009).",

Most infections of influenza virus A are localized to the upper respiratory tract but some more severe cases may result in pneumonia (Nicholson et al., 2003) and even complications involving the CNS (Jang et al., 2009). Several studies have shown that influenza A can be associated with encephalitis, Reye's syndrome, febrile seizure, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and possibly acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in humans (Millichap and Millichap, 2006, Ozkale et al., 2012, Toovey, 2008, Wang et al., 2010, Zeng et al., 2013). Making use of murine models, it has also been shown that influenza A virus could reach the CNS through the olfactory nerve route and alter hippocampal morphology or expression of synaptic regulatory genes while impairing cognition and emotional behavior (Beraki et al., 2005, Jurgens et al., 2012). Influenza A virus was also described as a factor which may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) (Jang et al., 2009).",

One report indicated that experimental intranasal inoculation of HCoV-229E to human volunteers led to disruption of the nasal epithelium, leading to damage of the ciliated cells and to a significant decrease in the number of cells and to a lowered frequency of cilium beating (Chilvers et al., 2001). On the other hand, using primary cultures of cells from the human respiratory tract, Dijkman and collaborators were able to further characterize the interaction between HCoV and epithelial cells and detected no cytopathic effect. Even though they showed that after infection all four circulating HCoV strains were budding and released preferentially on the apical side of the cells, a low but significant amount of virus was also found to be released from the basolateral side (Dijkman et al., 2013). This suggests that, even though HCoV infection are, most of the time, self-restricted to the airway lumen since they do not induce important disruption of the epithelium, they may, under certain circumstances, pass through the epithelium barrier and gain access to the bloodstream or lymph, where they can infect leukocytes and consequently disseminate toward other tissues, including the CNS (Fig. 1A; adapted from Desforges et al., 2007, Talbot et al., 2008) as it has been suggested for other important human respiratory viruses; namely measles virus (Wilson et al., 2013), Nipah virus (Mathieu et al., 2011) and influenza B virus (Xu et al., 1998).",

Since they eventually become macrophages as they invade tissues, this activation suggests that HCoV-229E-infected monocytes would serve to facilitate their passage toward other tissues including the CNS, especially in immune-compromised individuals, as this was observed for murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) (Reuter et al., 2004). The fact that HCoV-229E could only infect partially immune-compromised transgenic mice (Lassnig et al., 2005) suggests that, being an opportunistic pathogen, HCoV-229E could take advantage of an immune-suppressed environment and disseminate to the CNS within susceptible individuals. The establishment of a persistent infection in a human leukocytic cell line (Desforges et al., 2007) is also consistent with the possibility that monocytes/macrophages serve as a reservoir and vector for this neuroinvasive HCoV (Arbour et al., 2000). The SARS-CoV was also shown to infect monocytes-macrophages (Gu et al., 2005, Nicholls et al., 2006) and dendritic cells, where it modulates innate immunity (Spiegel et al., 2006). These cells could also serve as a reservoir for virus to reach and maintain itself in the CNS. Our results indicate that HCoV are able to infect human endothelial cells of the BBB in culture (unpublished data). It has also been speculated that SARS-CoV could do the same after viremia (Guo et al., 2008). Therefore, neuroinvasive coronaviruses that infect humans could use the hematogenous route to penetrate into the CNS.",

Interestingly, the neurotropic MHV strains of the murine coronavirus (MuCoV) also reach the CNS through the olfactory nerve (Barnett and Perlman, 1993). Furthermore, as shown here in Fig. 2\n, once in the brain, HCoV-OC43 is able to disseminate from the olfactory bulb to other regions of the brain, including the cortex and the hippocampus, from which it appears to spread by a trans-neuronal route before it eventually reaches the brainstem and spinal cord (Desforges et al., 2013b). These results suggest that coronaviruses may also invade the human CNS from the external environment through the neuroepithelium of the olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb before infecting the resident cells of the brain, and potentially the spinal cord (Fig. 1B), as reviewed by Mori and colleagues for some neuroinvasive human viruses such as influenza virus, Herpes simplex virus (HSV), and borna disease virus (BDV) (Mori et al., 2005).",

However, research has not yet led to a direct link to any specific virus or other microbes with MS. Association of coronaviruses with MS was suggested in numerous reports that are reviewed elsewhere (Desforges et al., 2013b). One of these reports demonstrated a significant association of colds with MS exacerbations and a significant association of HCoV-229E infection in MS patients (Hovanec and Flanagan, 1983) and another report on the association of viral infections and MS (Sibley et al., 1985) commented that seasonal HCoV infection patterns do fit the observed occurrence of MS exacerbations.",

            "text": "We were previously able to confirm that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E are naturally neuroinvasive in humans. Indeed, viruses were detected in some control brains and in some brains coming from patients different neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, there was a significantly higher prevalence of HCoV-OC43 in brains of MS patients (Arbour et al., 2000) and viral RNA was found more often in female brain samples (Fig. 3A). Even though this observation is only circumstantial, it is interesting to note that MS is more prevalent in women than in men (Bove and Chitnis, 2013). Moreover, this data, in association with the observation that autoreactive T cells were able to recognize both viral and myelin antigens in MS patients but not in controls during infection by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E (Boucher et al., 2007, Talbot et al., 1996), suggest that the immune response may participate in the induction or exacerbation of neuropathologies such as MS in genetically or otherwise susceptible individuals (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, even though the use of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A in HCoV-OC43-infected mice resulted in a faster onset of encephalitis, suggesting a role for T cells in viral clearance and survival with no related immunopathology (Jacomy et al., 2006), it was shown that in recombination activation gene (RAG) knock-out mice, HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis could be partially mediated by the T-cell response to infection (Butler et al., 2006). The participation of different types of T cells has been shown to play a significant role in the demyelinating neurological disease induced by the murine CoV, in particular for strain MHV-JHM (Matthews et al., 2002). Furthermore, used as an experimental model of chronic viral infection associated with demyelination in the mouse CNS, this murine coronavirus has recently been shown to reflect partial oxidative tissue injury found in MS lesion in humans (Schuh et al., 2014), underlining the possibility that long term infection of the CNS by coronaviruses may induce MS-like lesions. This may also apply for persistence of HCoV RNA in the human CNS (Arbour et al., 2000), which in some conditions, could be associated with onset or exacerbation of neuropathologies, including MS.",

The increased cytokine production following infection by the S-mutant viruses may induce direct damage to neurons (Amor et al., 2010) and/or disturb glutamate homeostasis by down-regulating the glutamate transporter GLT-1 on astrocytes that should recapture the excess of glutamate, which may generate glutamate excitotoxicity (Carmen et al., 2009) and thereby contribute to neuronal degeneration (Fig. 4\n; Brison et al., 2011), which can be associated with hind-limb paralysis and possible demyelination (Brison et al., 2011, Jacomy et al., 2010).

            "text": "When present in the murine CNS, HCoV-OC43 infects neurons in different regions of the brain (Fig. 2), before reaching the spinal cord. Infection of these essential cells induces their degeneration as observed by aberrant state of neurofilament phosphorylation (Brison et al., 2011, Brison et al., 2014, Jacomy et al., 2010), a situation that often leads to cell death and that could be directly induced by viral replication. Furthermore, using two model cell lines representing differentiated human neurons, we were able to demonstrate that programmed cell death (PCD) was induced after HCoV-OC43 infection (Favreau et al., 2009, Favreau et al., 2012) and that the inhibition of viral replication was also in direct correlation with increased cell survival, suggesting that infection and production of progeny infectious viruses directly participate in the process of degeneration and eventual death of neurons. Our results indicate that the underlying mechanisms appear to involve different cellular factors and pathways, including caspase-independent apoptosis, parthanatos and necroptosis, three forms of programmed cell death (PCD) reviewed elsewhere by the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) (Galluzzi et al., 2012). These cell death pathways can act separately but may also interact in response to a stimulus (including a viral infection), as they share some of the cellular factors involved in the overall process that leads to cell death and that often converges toward mitochondria (Galluzzi et al., 2012). Fig. 5\nis a tentative representation of the various pathways and cellular factors associated with PCD that may be activated and/or inhibited during HCoV-OC43 infection of neurons. It is based on our data (Brison et al., 2011, Favreau et al., 2009, Favreau et al., 2012, Jacomy et al., 2010) and on the scientific literature that describes some molecular pathways (parthanatos, necroptosis and apoptosis) and cellular factors, including calcium overload, endoplasmic reticulum stress, excitotoxicity, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and calpain involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and eventual neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death (Cali et al., 2011, Galluzzi et al., 2012, Kaiser et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Virus-cell interactions are always important in the regulation of cell response to infection. For HCoV-OC43, we clearly showed that the viral S glycoprotein is an important factor of neurovirulence and neurodegeneration of infected cells (Brison et al., 2011, Favreau et al., 2009, Jacomy et al., 2010). This was similarly shown for the strains MHV-A59 and MHV\u2013JHM of the MuCoV species, the murine counterpart of HCoV-OC43. Indeed, several reports and reviews have, over the years, shown that the S protein of this neuroinvasive and neurotropic murine coronavirus is a major factor associated with neurovirulence during encephalitis and the eventual demyelinating disease in susceptible mice (Bender and Weiss, 2010, Hosking and Lane, 2010). We have also demonstrated that the HE protein is an important factor for the production of infectious HCoV-OC43, suggesting an attenuation of the eventual spread into the CNS of viruses made deficient in fully active HE protein (Desforges et al., 2013a). Therefore, as the infection of neuronal cells and production of infectious virus apparently directly participate in the induction of neuronal death, the HE protein of HCoV-OC43 could play a role in neurovirulence of HCoV-OC43, like it does for MHV (Kazi et al., 2005). In recent years, several coronavirus accessory proteins, including the TGEV protein 7 and the MHV ns2 protein have been extensively studied and are now considered as important viral factors of virulence implicated in pathogenesis as they are able to counteract host-cell response associated with the activation of RNAse L and the type 1 interferon response (Cruz et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2012, Zhao et al., 2011). Our more recent work on the on-going characterization of HCoV interactions with the cells from the CNS has led us to determine that two of these accessory proteins (ns2 and ns5), produced during infection of susceptible cells by HCoV-OC43, play a significant role in virulence and pathogenesis in the mouse CNS (Fig. 6\n) partially by modulating virus production (data not shown).",

Furthermore, the involvement of SARS-CoV in CNS infections was underscored by the findings that made use of transgenic mouse models expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (the cellular receptor used by SARS-CoV to infect susceptible cells). Indeed, using these mice, it was shown that SARS-CoV could invade the CNS after an intranasal infection primarily through the olfactory bulb (Netland et al., 2008) or even after an intra-peritoneal infection (Tseng et al., 2007), with concomitant neuronal loss (Netland et al., 2008, Tseng et al., 2007); a phenomenon that can eventually lead to neurological problems. To our knowledge, there exist no reports on the detection of HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and MERS-CoV in the human CNS. On the other hand, neurological symptoms have been described in association with both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 (Severance et al., 2011) and a recent report, which evaluated MERS-CoV cell tropism, suggest that, among several cell lines representative of different tissues and organs, this virus seems to be able to infect the neuron-committed human cell line NT2 (Fuk-Woo Chan et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Based on several pieces of evidence presented herein, we hypothesize that neuroinvasive coronaviruses could participate in the damage of the human CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses (virus-induced neuroimmunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly induces damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology). In acute encephalitis, viral replication occurs in the brain tissue itself, possibly causing destructive lesions of the nervous tissue (Talbot et al., 2011). As previously mentioned, chronic human neurological diseases may also be linked to viral infection. However, in several cases of these chronic diseases, it is very hard to ascertain a role for any given virus, in part due to the difficulty of establishing the time at which these viruses become involved. Also, the four Koch's postulates dictate whether a particular infectious agent causes a specific disease (Koch, 1942). However, several viral infections, especially slow viral infections related to diseases that are rare manifestations of an infection, represent situations where Koch's postulates need to be modified (Fredericks and Relman, 1996, Hill, 1965). A series of new criteria, adapted from Sir Austin Bradford Hill's for causation (Hill, 1965), was elaborated by Giovannoni and collaborators (Giovannoni et al., 2006) and should replace Koch's postulates when one wants to evaluate the relevance of any given virus in relation to, for example, MS etiology (Giovannoni et al., 2006) or any other long-term human neurological diseases potentially related to a viral infection as well, including infection by human coronaviruses.",

Even though their use of the hematogenous or transneuronal route to gain access to the CNS in human beings remains to be elucidated, their presence in the human CNS is now a recognized fact. Furthermore, knowledge of mechanisms and consequences of coronavirus interactions with the nervous system is essential to better understand potentially pathological consequences and design intervention strategies that are appropriate to encephalitis or exacerbations of other types of neurological diseases for which a given virus is involved. In that regard, the Hill's criteria adapted by Giovannoni and collaborators may represent a highly relevant tool to evaluate the relevance of human coronaviruses as a factor which will influence the development and/or exacerbation of a long-term human neurological disease potentially related to a viral infection. Therefore, collecting new epidemiological data on a larger scale is certainly warranted to establish a more solid and direct link between coronaviruses and human neurological diseases. We have already gathered important and interesting data and identified some viral and cellular factors involved in HCoV/CNS cells interactions. However, further basic research that help decipher complex underlying mechanisms involved in virus-host-cell interactions is warranted and will be instrumental to our understanding of how coronaviruses that infect human beings, given the proper susceptibility conditions and proper virus evolution and infection conditions, may induce neuronal degeneration and could participate in the induction or exacerbation of human neuropathologies.",

(A) Following infection of human airways, human coronaviruses may, in some conditions, pass through the epithelium, gain access to the bloodstream and infect monocytes, which are activated by the infection. Among other factors, MMP9, which increases BBB permeability and TNF-alpha, which leads to up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cells, facilitates the passage of infected and activated monocytes into the CNS. Once in the CNS, these cells produce proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-alpha) that can damage the oligodendrocytes and/or the neurons. Infiltrated infected monocyte-derived macrophages (or microglia) may produce chemokines (CCL-5, CXCL10, CXCL11), which will induce chemoattraction of activated T cells and/or other monocytes. After sensing the infection, astrocytes may also produce other chemokines (CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL12) that will also participate in the recruitment of more infected leukocytes. Human coronaviruses may therefore initiate an aberrant neuroinflammatory loop which will mediate an immune-mediated neuropathology (adapted from Talbot et al., 2008). (B) Following intranasal infection in human, coronaviruses may infect the olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) and pass through the neuroepithelium of the olfactory mucosa to reach the mitral cells and the olfactory nerve (ON) and gain access to the olfactory bulb (OB) and eventually to the hippocampus and other regions of the brain.",

In physiological conditions, glutamate is mainly synthesized by neurons and released in the synaptic cleft as the primary excitatory neurotransmitter of the CNS that activates the ligand-dependant receptor AMPAr (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionoc acid receptor), which allows the entry of sodium ions and the passage of the nerve impulse in the post-synaptic neuron, leading to activation of the NMDA receptor (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) that allows the entry of calcium ions. During infection of neurons by HCoV-OC43, microglial cells detect the presence of virus and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6) that down-regulate the astrocytic receptor GLT-1 (glutamate transporter 1) and prevent the efficient recapture of glutamate. This situation disturbs the regulation of glutamate homeostasis and the excess of this neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft leads to excitotoxicity associated with a massive entry of calcium which eventually leads to degeneration of and death of neuronal cells.",

            "text": "Fig. 5: Pathways of neuronal degeneration and programmed cell death (PCD) activated or potentially inhibited after HCoV-OC43 infection of neuronal cells. Hallmarks of apoptosis, including the relocalization of the activated pro-apoptotic protein BAX (Bcl-2 associated protein X) from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome C release from mitochondria toward the cytosol, DNA fragmentation and activation of caspases-3 and -9, are observed during infection of human neurons. However, even though virus induces Bax relocalization, it may inhibit classical apoptosis by blocking Bax pro-apoptotic function at the mitochondria and/or downstream of caspase activation, suggesting a caspase-independent type of apoptosis. Relocalization of the mitochondrial protein AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) toward the nucleus (truncated tAIF) is observed after infection and participates in DNA fragmentation. AIF is known to be activated during caspase-independent apoptosis. However, AIF is also involved in Parthanatos, another form of PCD potentially associated with neurodegeneration. As they are synthesized by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) during a neuronal stress, including during HCoV-OC43 infection, polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) may relocalize toward mitochondria and participate in the activation and relocalization of AIF toward the cytosol before it reaches the nucleus. Cyclophilin D (CypD) inhibition decreases AIF release from mitochondria and abrogates cell death induced by infection. AIF release from mitochondria may be induced through its truncation (tAIF) by activated calpain, which is usually activated by a rise in the mitochondrial calcium concentration. This increase in calcium concentration may be linked with either an important entry from the extracellular milieu (for instance during glutamate excitotoxicity) or with a release of calcium from the ER following induction of ER stress. However HCoV-OC43 may inhibit the ER stress-related pathway in infected neurons. Infection induces RIP1 gene expression and the knock-down of the receptor interacting protein kinase-1 (RIP-1), significantly increases cell survival, suggesting that necroptosis, a third form of PCD which involves RIP-1 and RIP-3 downstream of the death receptor family, may play a role in HCoV-OC43-induced neuronal death.
