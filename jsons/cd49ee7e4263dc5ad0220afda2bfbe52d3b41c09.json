            "text": ". Large variability in the clinical 4 presentations of COVID-19 disease amongst close contacts and members of the same household have 5 been observed in clinical practice. During my conversations with next of kin of several critically ill 6 patients with COVID-19 at Ochsner Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, USA, similar narratives were 7 brought to my attention-members of a genetically related family suffered similar severity of disease 8 while non-genetically related individuals in direct contact were mildly affected or asymptomatic (for 9 example: spouses). Following my observations of this occurrence in greater than half of the critically ill 10 COVID-19 patients I encountered, a systematic study to investigate this phenomenon in the local 11 population is in process. 12 A recent case of an 83-year-old male who died at home after 1 week of fever, cough, and delirium from 13 COVID-19 further illustrates this phenomenon. At home close contacts included his daughter and her 3 14 adult children who tested positive for COVID-19 and suffered from self-limiting moderately severe 15 symptoms around the same time; and his son-in-law who remained asymptomatic and later demonstrated 16 IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These observations hint at a selectivity of the virus within the 17 human species that is predictive of the induction of clinical disease and the extent of pathogenesis among 18 individuals. Conceivably, such selectivity may be more cogent than the recently reported risk factors of 19 older age (\u226565 years old) and comorbidities (diabetes, underlying heart diseases, hypertension) associated 20 with the development of severe illness 3,4 . It can be hypothesized that the nature of this selectivity hinges 21 on the affinity for select genetic profiles. Relevant to this hypothesis, the genetic underpinnings of the 22 susceptibility to infection may be explained by the polymorphisms of functional receptors needed for the 23 virus to enter host target cells. For instance, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has shown 24 to be involved in the viral genome replication process 5 . Susceptibility to organ injury, including fatal lung 25 2 and myocardial injury, in COVID-19 is thought to be linked to variations in the distribution and 26 functional attributes of ACE2 receptors in the population 6 . 27 Several questions stem from this conceptual approach. These include: (a) Did the selectivity originate in a 28 progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 that, after contact with humans, acquired favorable genetic modifications 29 through adaptation during undetected human-to-human transmission; (b) is this selectivity a manifest of 30 Darwin's theory of Evolution by Natural Selection; (c) is the selectivity fixed or evolving as the virus 31 continues to spread during the pandemic; (d) what are the implications of this selectivity on the 32 development of an effective vaccine. 33 The selectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for human genetic profiles as a factor of the virulence appears 34 to be a novel feature. There are no descriptions of a similar phenomenon associated with the 1918 35 influenza pandemic or the epidemics of widespread respiratory illnesses caused by other coronaviruses. 36Conceivably, this may have been underreported and not investigated systematically in the early to middle 37 20 th century 7,8 . Among the non-respiratory viruses, susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus-1 38 infection was reported to be associated with genetically determined variations in host chemokine 39 receptors 9 suggesting that varied selectivity exists in the virulence behaviors of other viruses in nature. 40",
