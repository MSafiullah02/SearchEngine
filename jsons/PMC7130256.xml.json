Physical examination revealed high fever, left parotid inflammation without erythema, expiratory wheezing and hypoxaemia, requiring admission and treatment with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy. The chest X-ray demonstrated an infiltrate in the right middle lobe. Cervical ultrasound revealed an enlarged left parotid gland, with multiple internal lesions of low echogenicity in relation to intraglandular inflammatory changes. Intraglandular adenopathy and bilateral laterocervical chains were also observed. The blood test showed normal haemoglobin and platelets; 13,000 leukocytes (44% neutrophils); C-reactive protein 41 mg/L and amylase 381 U/L. Blood culture was negative, and a multiplex polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal aspirate taken at admission (CLART\u00ae Pneumovir array assay that identifies adenovirus, metapneumovirus A,B, parinfluenza 1,2,3,4, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A,B, bocavirus, influenza A,B,C, enterovirus and coronavirus 229E, OC43 & NL63) was positive for HBoV.

He was correctly vaccinated and mumps serology showed the presence of IgG titres. Acute EBV infection was also ruled out. The clinical picture evolved favourably and the nasopharyngeal aspirate control was negative two weeks after the acute episode. Although causality of HBoV is difficult to establish, serology has demonstrated that HBoV has a pathogenic role in respiratory infections.8, 9, 10 Unfortunately in our centre we do not have HBoV serology available, but we think that our case adds to those already described to make it consider that it may have an etiological role.",
