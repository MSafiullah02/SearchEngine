In the last century, there have been four significant worldwide outbreaks of influenza A with high mortality rates for humans [4]. To treat influenza, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of oseltamivir, which is a controversial [5, 6] antiviral agent that selectively inhibits the neuraminidases of both the influenza A and B viruses [7]. Viral neuraminidase promotes the release of progeny viruses from infected cells by cleaving the terminal sialic acid residues from carbohydrate moieties on the surfaces of host cells and influenza virus envelopes [8]. Oseltamivir was the best option for treatment and chemoprophylaxis during the influenza A/H1N1 2009 pandemic (influenza A/H1N1-pdm2009) outbreak because it could be administered to patients as young as 1-year old [9]. However, patients treated with oseltamivir have developed adverse reactions such as vertigo, dizziness, sickness, insomnia, headache, behavioural alterations, and numbness [10]. The U.S. FDA reported that oseltamivir\u2019s adverse effects on the central nervous system include delirium, hallucinations, confusion, abnormal behaviour, convulsions, and encephalitis [11] (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm107840.htm). Moreover, oseltamivir treatment has been associated with abnormal behaviour and death in patients from Japan and the United Kingdom [12\u201314]. However, the pharmaceutical industry has reported no adverse events [15]. In Mexico, oseltamivir phosphate was the only pro-drug that was distributed and prescribed for influenza treatment during the influenza A/H1N1-pdm2009 pandemic [16], and no information is available for adverse reactions in the Mexican population.",

Besides, oseltamivir carboxylate not only inhibits viral neuraminidase but can also inhibit human sialidases [21]. The genes that encode for Pept1, CES1, P-glycoprotein, and human neuraminidase (NEU2) harbour SNPs that affect their functions [22\u201329].",

The Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was estimated for all genetic polymorphisms by comparing their genotype frequencies. The associations were assessed using \u03c72 and exact Fisher tests in genetic models (codominant, dominant, overdominant, and recessive) and were validated by logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio was calculated with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The P values were two-tailed and adjusted by Bonferroni correction (Pc). Next, to exclude spurious association the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg test was used for multiple test correction [32]. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD, D\u2032) analysis between polymorphisms and haplotype reconstruction were performed. The associations between haplotypes and ADRs were determined by the Exact Fisher test. The HWE and haplotype reconstructions were performed using SNPstats software (https://www.snpstats.net/start.htm). The association analysis was conducted with SPSS software V.25 (IBM Corp., NY, USA).

In contrast to a previous study that demonstrated that oseltamivir NPAEs might be related to the presence of rs2032582 and rs1045642 ABCB1 gene polymorphisms [26], our data indicated that only rs1045642 was associated with oseltamivir adverse effects.",

PepT1 also plays an important role in the transport of oseltamivir [18]. SLC15A1, the gene that encodes PepT1, presents several allelic forms. In particular, the rs2297322 polymorphism significantly reduces the transport capacity of PepT1 [45]. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether this polymorphism is associated with the adverse effects caused by treatment with oseltamivir. However, the data demonstrate that the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the SLC15A1 gene were not in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium, and analysis of this mutation was therefore omitted from this paper.",

            "text": "In addition to bioavailability alterations, oseltamivir adverse effects have also been associated with deficiencies in its metabolism. CES1, the main enzyme responsible for oseltamivir metabolism [46], presents genetic polymorphisms that change the conformation of the protein, which results in enzymes with slow or no activity. In particular, in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the allelic variant rs71647871 presents a decreased oseltamivir metabolism [19]. As Table 4 demonstrates, the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the CES1 rs71647871 polymorphism in our Mexican population were <1%, similar to the frequencies reported in Americans [47]. Other genetic studies have revealed mutation frequencies in CES1 of 3.7% in white populations, 4.3% in black populations, 2.0% in Hispanic populations, and 0% in Asian populations [47]. Shi et al. suggested that this mutation could explain ~4% of the variability in the activation of oseltamivir [19]. While the rs2233385 NEU2 polymorphism has not been reported in European and African Americans, our results establish that the allelic frequency of this variant in the Mexican population was 7.4%, which is very similar to the frequency observed in Asian populations (9.2%) [29]. However, no association with oseltamivir side effects was found. Additional factors, such as oseltamivir\u2019s interactions with other drugs and alterations of inflammatory cytokines, could influence the activity of receptors and enzymes. These factors might contribute to an increase in the accumulation of oseltamivir, thus increasing the occurrence of adverse effects in humans. The limitations of this study were that it analysed a small number of samples and observed a low number of adverse effects. For these reasons, it is necessary to validate our results in a larger number of samples to suggest to the polymorphism in the transporter as a potential predictive biomarker of ADRs in oseltamivir treatment.",
