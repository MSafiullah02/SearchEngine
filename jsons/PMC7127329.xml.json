            "text": "Livestock sector in India plays a pivotal role in supporting the livelihood of rural masses. This sector alone contributes 4.11% of the total GDP. Economics of any livestock farm dependent on the health of its neonates, which are the future herd [1]. Despite the fact, neonatal calves are abysmally cared, with the result significant morbidity and mortality of these calves incurred huge economic consequences. Amongst various causes, the calf diarrhoea (enteritis) is a commonly reported disease worldwide in cattle. Diarrhoea is a multi-factorial disease, which accounts for 57% of mortality in <1 month old calves [2]. In diarrhoeic calves, although co-infection observed frequently, but at times a single etiology can also be the cause in some cases. Major enteric viral pathogens responsible for calf diarrhoea are mainly Rotavirus and Coronavirus. Of late, newer emerging enteric pathogens such as Torovirus, Norovirus, Nebovirus, Enterovirus, Calcivirus and Parvovirus have also been added to the list of diarrhoea causing agents [3]. Co-infection with more than one pathogen is more frequent and often worsens the symptoms. The tetrad of Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Escherichia coli accounts for 75\u201395% of infection in neonatal calves worldwide, of which especially rotavirus and coronavirus account for 27\u201336% and 20\u201326% infections, respectively [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. Among all pathogens, rotaviruses are the leading cause of calf diarrhoea, and coronaviruses are a major contributor to it [4,5,8,9]. The coronavirus infect both small intestine and large intestine to cause severe disease [10]. In calves, group A rotavirus and coronavirus, either single or in combination, are predominately associated with neonatal (mostly up to 5\u201315 day old) diarrhoea [11]. These pathogens, if not causing death in claves, warrant extra care and sometimes intensive care of calves [12]. The diagnosis of diarrhoea (enteritis) cases is cumbersome due to non specific nature of clinical signs/lesions, interaction of polymicrobial agents and involvement of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors [13].",

Triple protein coat of virus helps them to escape unaffected from the acidic pH of the stomach and the digestive enzymes in the gut. The mature enterocytes of duodenum villi are the first to become infected to release significant number of virions, to favor more severe attack on enterocytes of mid and distal portion of small intestine [14]. Bovine coronavirus is capable of infecting mature epithelium of small intestine and large intestine. Villi of the affected small intestine and colonic crypts become atrophic, and the lamina propria becomes necrotic and lumen of hyperplastic crypts filled with necrotic debris [15]. Necrosis of mesenteric lymph node, payers patches of ileum and formation of cryptic abscesses in colon of calves also the histopathological lesions detected in coronavirus infection [16].The pathological data on bovine coronavirus and rotavirus in India are very limited.We used RT-PCR and IHC to investigate the pathological changes in the of natural cases of bovine rotavirus and coronavirus infected dairy calves.",

In three cases, where rotavirus was identified, grossly the serosa of small and large intestine was severely congested and the lumen filled with blood mixed catarrhal contents. The pin head sized hemorrhagic spots were found on the mucosal surfaces of the jejunum and the ileum. Mesenteric lymph nodes were swollen, severely congested and edematous. Histopathological examination of the ileum showed fusion and sloughing of villi enterocytes and severe engorgement of capillary plexus and mononuclear cells (mainly lymphocytes and few macrophages) infiltration in the lamina propria (Fig. 3\n, a).The crypt epithelium was found proliferated.

Microscopically, the villi of the ileum were sloughed off at several places and their lamina propria was severely engorged/hemorrhagic and infiltrated with mononuclear cells. There was thick homogeneous necrotic material adhered upon upper mucous surface of the colon (Fig. 5, b). Mesenteric lymph nodes showed moderate depletion of many cortical follicles (Fig. 3, d). In other one case, grossly, whole small and large intestinal tract was moderately congested and filled with yellowish faecal material. Mesenteric lymph nodes were juicy, enlarged and slightly congested. Histopathological examination of the jejunum showed severs infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria and crypts showed skipping lesion of microabscesses (Fig. 5, c). Crypt lining cells were slightly hyperplastic. The capsule of mesenteric lymph nodes was thick and lymphoid follicles were necrosed. We observed immunohistochemical staining for coronavirus antigen in all four calves which was positive from RT-PCR. The BCoV antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi, necrotic crypts in the jejunum and cryptic microabscesses in the colon and ileum (Fig. 6\n). We also detected strong immunoreactions in the mononuclear cells of mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 6d).",

            "text": "Diarrhoea in calves is a multifactorial disease that results into hypersecretion of fluid, malabsorption due to disruption of enterocytes, exudation of protein due to increased capillary/epithelial permeability or hypermotility leading to approximately 75% of the calf mortality under 3-weeks-age [19]. The recovered cases of diarrhoea might suffer with production losses even more than anticipated. The diarrhoea due to rotavirus and coronavirus in infants of humans, neonates of mammalian and avian species is a worldwide problem. The age has been found to be the greatest influencing factor in causing rotavirus and coronavirus infections. In our study calves below 1-month of age suffered with these pathogens. The same has been described by previous workers for occurrence of rotaviral and coronavirus diarrhoea in neonatal calves [20]: [21,22]. The reason for high occurrence of these pathogens below one-month of age could be due to less developed immune system in neonates and the lack of adequate amount of maternal antibodies in the colostrum [23], so the free sites are available for attachment of virus to sialic acid or galactosidase receptors of enterocytes. These receptors disappear with the increasing age of neonates [24].",

Similarly, the extra-intestinal lesions in mesenteric lymph nodes (lymphocytes depletion and antigen detection by IHC) were also matched with the findings of previous workers, who described the depletion of lymphocytes from the germinal centers of lymphoid follicles of mesenteric lymph nodes and detection of rotavirus antigen by direct immunofluorescence technique in calves [27,28]: [29]. The rotavirus replication in macrophages have also been demonstrated in such studies, indicating a possible mechanism of rotaviral spread via the lymphatic of lamina propria to extra-intestinal organs.",

The histopathological lesions of coronavirus were colocalized with viral capsid protein in the jejunum and mesenteric lymph nodes, indicated that the lesions observed were due to coronavirus infection and replication. In present study the bovine coronavirus antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi, jejunum, ileum, colon and mesenteric lymph nodes which was accordance with [31]; who demonstrated coronavirus antigen in intestine of calves by immunohistochemistory, which was negative for RT-PCR. It is the first report of BRoV and BCoV antigen demonstration in the jejunum, colon, ileum, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes of naturally infected calves from India by using immunohistochemistory. Overall, the findings suggest that, the BRoV and BCoV caused calf diarrhoea with specific lesions in the intestines (enteritis) and mesenteric lymph nodes. These lesions might have resulted into morbidity and mortality in bovine calves below 3 weeks of age. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis by which BRoV and BCoV spread beyond the intestine and cause disease other than enteritis. Understanding the immuno-pathogenesis at subtle level would further enhance our knowledge in adopting better measures to control the BRoV and BCoV associated diarrhoea in bovine calves.",
