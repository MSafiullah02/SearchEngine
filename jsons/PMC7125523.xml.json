The infectious evidence of Kawasaki disease includes temporal clustering and marked seasonality, geographic clustering, family clustering, a high association between Kawasaki disease and infectious disease surveillance, and age distribution, for which the highest incidence rates are seen among 6 month\u20132-year-old children who have low maternal antibodies and are most susceptible to infections in general.11, 12, 13, 14 We hypothesize that infections with certain viruses may elicit systemic inflammation, and further small and median sized vasculitis, so-called Kawasaki disease, in certain hosts because we found a higher incidence of KD among males, young children, and Asian populations. We thus carried out a prospective case-control study to investigate the association of common viral infections with Kawasaki disease to test the above hypothesis.",

For example, studies from Europe and Canada reported a higher incidence in winter,40 whereas Taiwan and Korea have the highest incidence rates of KD during the summer,11, 41 Beijing and Hong Kong in the spring and summer, and Japan in January and summer.3, 42, 43 Such seasonality and temporal clustering of KD suggests that different infectious diseases in different countries might trigger this clustering presentation. In the summer, enterovirus infection was one of the most common infections in young children in Taiwan. We also detected enterovirus most frequently in KD cases, which links enterovirus with KD in the summer. Other respiratory viruses, such as adenoviruses, may play an important role during other seasons because adenoviruses circulate all year-round in Taiwan. We proposed that it was not the same infectious etiology, but rather heterogeneous infectious agents in different areas and different seasons, which trigger KD; there was no single pathogen reported to be associated with KD worldwide. That is to say, different pathogens might be responsible for KD in different countries or different seasons. This may explain why no single pathogen was consistently found in cases with Kawasaki disease. For example, Jordan-Villegas et al44 reported that 8.8% of KD patients had documented respiratory viral infections including rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. A recent article also reported a case of KD associated with parainfluenza type 3 viral infection,45 and another article reported adenovirus detection in some KD cases.46 However, Kim et al47 reported that there was no significant association between the presence of any of the 15 respiratory viruses and the incidence of KD. New tests or techniques for specific microorganisms may help us find the etiology of KD.48, 49\n",
