In platinum-sensitive relapse, rechallenge with first-line chemotherapy is recommended. In platinum-refractory relapse, oral topotecan is the preferred regimen. Cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine is not recommended as an alternative to topotecan in view of the need to hospitalise the patient.Any third-line chemotherapy should be considered only in fit patients with low risk of complications.\n",

            "text": "Surgery\nConsider delaying surgery for up to 3 months in small tumours that appear not to grow fast; follow up of growth rate with chest CT is recommended [3].Consider stereotactic radiotherapy as an alternative in patients who are marginally fit for surgery, due to comorbidity or limited pulmonary reserve [3].Minimal invasive approaches are preferred over thoracotomy to limit time-in-hospital [3].\nAdjuvant chemotherapy:\nAdjuvant chemotherapy in stage II and III and in some patients with high-risk stage IB leads to 5% improvement in 5-year survival and is therefore recommended.In elderly patients, patients with significant comorbidity or decreased performance (PS\u22652), the possible benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy may be outweighed by the increased risk of complications. Consider omitting adjuvant chemotherapy or stopping early (e.g. after 3 cycles) [3].Consider giving cisplatin/docetaxel to limit time-in-hospital, as it avoids day 8 administration of gemcitabine or vinorelbine, and has equivalent efficacy. In non-squamous NSCLC, cisplatin/pemetrexed is an equally efficacious alternative [8].In patients with an activating EGFR mutation, consider a 1 year course of daily oral EGFR-TKI as an alternative to adjuvant chemotherapy (currently no phase 3 evidence of superiority available).\nRadiotherapy\nConsider delaying curative radiotherapy for small tumours that appear not to grow fast; follow up of growth rate with chest CT is recommended [3].\nConcurrent chemoradiotherapy:\nConsider giving cisplatin/pemetrexed instead of cisplatin/etoposide, or weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel in non-squamous NSCLC to limit time-in-hospital [9].Consider giving adjuvant durvalumab at a dose of 20 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 every 4 weeks instead of 10 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 every 2 weeks to limit time-in-hospital. Phase 1b data have not shown an increase in adverse events [3, 10]\nSystemic therapy:\nEvaluate the indication for palliative chemotherapy, immunotherapy or both with extra care in elderly patients or patients with significant comorbidity, decreased performance (PS \u22652), social isolation, decubitus, urinary catheters, \u2026 especially in second or further lines [3].Consider delaying chemotherapy or immunotherapy in patients who are asymptomatic and have indolent disease [3].Usual recommendations for chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy apply.In patients with increased risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) dose reduction might be an alternative to primary prophylactic use of G-CSF in all patients, given the palliative setting [7].Keep in mind that pneumonitis may also be drug-induced (e.g. chemotherapy, TKI's) or immune-mediated (checkpoint inhibitors).Triweekly chemotherapy is preferred over weekly regimens (e.g. docetaxel) to limit time-in-hospital [4].Consider limiting palliative chemotherapy to 4 cycles and omitting pemetrexed maintenance therapy [3].In patients who are PD-L1 >50%, first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy is preferred over pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy [3].Consider giving nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks instead of 240 mg every 2 weeks to limit time-in-hospital [3, 11].Immunotherapy in second-line is preferred over chemotherapy in patients who did not receive immunotherapy in first line.In case of lack of response to immunotherapy or significant toxicity, early discontinuation should be considered.Third-line chemotherapy is not advisable [3].Consider evaluating the response to immunotherapy or TKI less often in clinically stable patients.\nSupportive therapy/other:\nAdvance care planning should be discussed with all patients in order to avoid admission to hospital [3].Do not resuscitate (DNR) status should be available for all stage 4 patients.Patients receiving denosumab or low-molecular-weight heparin should be taught to self-administer [3].Patients receiving denosumab should not routinely consult a dentist before starting.Avoid transfusion of blood or platelets by using dose reduction or early discontinuation of chemotherapy in palliative patients.\n",
