In available healthcare systems, the mortality of mechanically ventilated patients with community-acquired COVID-19 may be different. Thus, we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and compared them with those with seasonal influenza to better understand the differences between severe COVID-19 and influenza illness. Diagnoses of COVID-19 and influenza were confirmed with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal swab. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings at initial presentation, therapeutic modalities, and 30-day mortality were obtained from electronic medical records of the study population. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS Institute; Cary, NC). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the KNUH.",
