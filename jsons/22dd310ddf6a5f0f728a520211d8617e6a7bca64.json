In this review, the root causes of the spreading of fake news are identified to reduce the encouraging of such false information. To combat the spreading of fake news on social media, the reasons behind the spreading of fake news must first be identified. Therefore, this literature review takes an early initiative to identify the possible reasons behind the spreading of fake news. The purpose of this literature review is to identify why individuals tend to share false information and to possibly help in detecting fake news before it spreads.",

It is the ability of an individual to understand thought and execute valid reasoning and understanding of concept [34] . With an increasing amount of information being shared across social media platforms it can be challenging for social media users to determine which of the information is closest to the original source [22] . The issue of individuals not having the ability to distinguish between real and fake news have been raised in many articles [10] . Users of social media tend to not investigate the information they are reading or sharing [2] . This can therefore lead to the rapid sharing and spreading of any unchecked information across social media platforms [2] . [10] . The trustworthiness of a certain article is based on how successful the exchange of the articles are [12] . The more successful the exchange, the more likely social media users will share the information [12] . Social media users make supposedly reasonable justifications to determine the authenticity of the information provided [35] .",

Some fake news websites or pages are specifically designed to harm a certain user's reputation [5, 10] . Social media influencers influence users' emotional and health outcomes [12] . Fake news creators specifically target users with false information [3] . This false information is specifically designed to deceive and manipulate social media users [21] . Fake news stories like this, intend to mislead the public and generate false beliefs [21] . In some cases, hackers have been known to send out fake requests to social media users to gain access to their personal information [39] . The spreading of hoax has also become a problem on social media. The goal of hoaxes is to manipulate the opinion of the public and to maximize public attention [35] . Social spammers have also become more popular over the last few years with the goal to launch different kinds of attacks on social media users, for example spreading viruses or phishing [2] . Fake reviews have also been known to disrupt the online community through writing reviews that typically aim to direct people away from a certain product or person [2] . Another method used by various malicious users, is to purchase fake followers to spread harmful malware more swiftly [26] .",

Upon retrieving multiple reasons for the spreading of false information, they were categorized into main factors and sub-factors. These factors included social factors, cognitive factors, political factors, financial factors and malicious factors. Considering the rapidly expanding social media environment, it was found that especially social factors have a very significant influence in the sharing of fake news on social media platforms. Its sub-factors of conformity and peer-influence; social comparison and satire and humorous fakes have great influence when deciding to share false information. Secondly, it was concluded that malicious factors like hate propaganda also fuel the sharing of false information with the possibility to financially gain or to do harm.",

It was also evident that social media users may sometimes be ignorant and indifferent when sharing and spreading information. Fact-checking resources are available but the existence thereof is fairly unknown and therefore often unused. Hopefully better knowledge and education will encourage a desire among social media users to be more aware of possible unchecked information and the sources of information and to stop the forwarding of false information. A better understanding of the motives behind the sharing of false information can potentially prepare social media users to be more vigilant when sharing information on social media. The goal of this literature review was only to identify the factors that drive the spreading of fake news on social media platforms and did not fully address the dilemma of combatting the sharing and spreading of false information.",
