The German study showed that in 5% of the cases when an agent was detected there was more than one potential pathogen and in most cases this was Adv with another pathogen 6.

The population of Asia is large and often dense, especially in China and Japan. Consequently, epidemics of ARD caused by Advs occur at high frequency.

But in Hong Kong and Mexico, Adv infections are usually more frequent in winter and spring. The infections were distributed among the different age groups and no differences were found in the respiratory symptoms between the children positive for Adv positive and with ARI without Adv 27, 28. And there were no differences in age and gender distribution of Adv infection children in our study. Other studies found that children between 1 and 3 years of age were the most common age group affected by Adv. It is important to know the occurrence of the virus and the seasonal pattern, then patients can be managed with specific antiviral drugs and even the inappropriate use of antibiotics could be reduced to reduce the extensive burden of disease.
