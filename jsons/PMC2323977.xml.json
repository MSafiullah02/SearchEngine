As shown in Fig. 1B, RLU decreased progressively with increased concentrations of Ben-HCl.

We further demonstrate that Factor Xa also cleaved the S protein in pseudotyped SARS-CoV/HIV. When the pseudovirus was incubated with Factor Xa at room temperature for 2 h, the pseudoviral S protein was partially cleaved, and the cleavage increased with the concentration of Factor Xa (Fig. 2B). When the incubation time was extended to 6 h, the pseudoviral S protein could be almost completely cleaved by 0.5 U of Factor Xa (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the cleavage of pseudoviral S protein by Factor Xa was inhibited by Ben-HCl at the concentration of 80 mM, showing the same pattern as untreated pseudovirus (Fig. 2). These results indicate that both recombinant and pseudoviral S protein can be cleaved by Factor Xa into S1 and S2 subunits, and that the cleavage can be prevented by the inhibitor Ben-HCl.",

Luciferase assay further demonstrates that the infectivity of the pseudovirus SARS-CoV/HIV increased with the extension of incubation and the cleavage of more S protein (Fig. 3B).

This is based on a hypothesis that the inhibitors might inactivate proteases on the cell membrane and thus block the cleavage of the S protein, thereby suppressing viral infection. Our results show that one inhibitor, Ben-HCl, is able to effectively suppress SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1A). Using the pseudovirus SARS-CoV/HIV, we further defined that Ben-HCl inhibits viral entry into the target cells but apparently does not suppress other steps of viral replication (Fig. 1B).",

Our results indicate that one of these proteases, Factor Xa, is able to effectively cleave the full-length recombinant S protein into S1 (\u223c105 kDa) and S2 (\u223c75 KDa) subunits, and that the cleavage can be inhibited by its inhibitor Ben-HCl (Fig. 2A).

Our results demonstrate that: (1) Factor Xa can effectively cleave the S protein in the pseudovirus SARS-CoV/HIV into S1 and S2 subunits and this cleavage is inhibited by Ben-HCl (Fig. 2B); (2) the S protein can be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits when the pseudovrus is incubated with its target cells (293T/ACE2) and the level of the cleavage correlates with viral infectivity (Fig. 3); and (3) the target cells express Factor Xa (Fig. 4), a membrane-bound protease [18]. As a whole, our study suggests a plausible mechanism by which SARS-CoV cleaves the S protein through the protease Factor Xa of infected cells to facilitate viral infection. Thus, the infection of SARS-CoV not only involves the binding of RBD with its receptor ACE2 and the fusion between viral envelope and host cell membrane, but also is associated with the cleavage of the S protein by proteases on the cell membrane, such as Factor Xa. It has been reported that the S protein of SARS-CoV forms trimeric peplomer on the surface of the virion [11]. The cleavage of the S protein may trigger virus\u2013cell fusion subsequent to the binding with ACE2 receptor and the dissociation of trimeric S protein to monomers.",

Antiviral peptides targeting the HR2 region of the S protein can block the entry of SARS-CoV into target cells [21]. Small molecules targeting SARS-CoV proteases, such as main proteases 3C-like protease (3CLpro) [22], papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) [23] and helicase [24], can inhibit viral replication. In addition to these targets, here we have provided the cleavage of the S protein as another crucial target for the development of vaccines and antiviral agents.
