Neuregulins mediate intercellular interactions in the nervous system, heart, breast, and other organ systems. They contribute to the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, adhesion, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. Neuregulin signaling between apposed cells is bidirectional. Forward signaling from a NRg-producing cell to a NRg-responsive cell relies on receptor Tyr kinases of the HER family. Reverse signaling (backward or back signaling) occurs from HER-expressing cells to NRg-producing cells. Neuregulin then serves as receptor and HER as agonist. This bidirectional communication is illustrated by motor neurons that produce NRgs and inform HER-synthesizing Schwann cells and skeletal myocytes. Neuregulins are ligands for HER3 and HER4 receptors. The HER2 receptor 11 is activated on neuregulin binding to HER3 and HER4 receptors. The HER2 receptor is required for neuregulin signaling [318] . Therefore, neuregulins bind to HER3, HER4, or both HER3 and HER4 that then form homoor heterodimers often including HER2 (e.g., HER2-HER4 and HER3-HER4), with which neuregulins interact only after linking to HER3 or HER4 [319].",

FGF3 to FGF8, FGF10, FGF17 to FGF19, and FGF21 to FGF23 are secreted proteins with cleavable N-terminal signal peptides. On the other hand, FGF9, FGF16, and FGF20 contain uncleavable bipartite signal sequences [325] . Isoforms FGF1 and FGF2 might be released by exocytosis.",

Memory consolidation involves synthesis of proteins, especially the transcription factors of the families of cAMP response element-binding proteins and CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins. 36 In rats, IGF2 enhances memory during a specific time window after learning (sensitive period of memory consolidation) [347] . 37 Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP) bind to and modulate the activity of insulin-like growth factors. Insulin-like growth factor binders include 6 members (IGFBP1-IGFBP6; Table 3 .8).). In addition, IGFBPs also have IGF-independent activities. Proteins IGFBP1, IGFBP2, and IGFBP6 are modest Wnt inhibitors, but IGFBP4 is the most potent repressor of the canonical Wnt pathway (Vol. 3 -Chap. 10. Morphogen Receptors). Proteins IGFBP3 and IGFBP5 do not intervene in Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling. Protein IGFBP4 binds and inhibits components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation, independently of IGF1 and IGF2. 38 35 Insulin-like growth factor receptor IGFR2 is also called mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR). It binds with high affinity to IGF2, but not IGF1. It lacks the major intracellular domains used in signal transduction. Its primary function is the inhibition of the action of IGF2 in utero. It controls the interstitial IGF2 concentration, as it fosters its endocytosis and lysosomal degradation [345] . 36 The transcription factor C/EBP\u03b2 is upregulated for more than 28 h after training [347] . 37 The concentrations of IGF2 messenger RNA and protein increase between 20 and 36 h after training, but neither immediately, nor 3 d after training. Enhancement of IGF2-dependent memory requires cytoskeletal-associated proteins and glycogen-synthase kinase GSK3 [347] . Moreover, IGF2 increases the expression of the \u03b1-amino 3-hydroxy 5-methyl 4-isoxasolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptor GluR1 subunit. In the hippocampus, IGF2 promotes a long-term potentiation after weak synaptic stimulation. The effect of the memory enhancer IGF2 is selectively mediated by IGF2R (mannose 6-phosphate receptor), but not IGFR1 receptor. 38 Protein IGFBP4 binds to the extracellular domain of Wnt receptor Frizzled Fz8 and coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein LRP6 [348] . It is expressed in cells adjacent to cardiomyocyte progenitors (paracrine regulation). It competes with Wnt3a to bind to Frizzled-8 and impedes the Fz8-LRP6-Wnt3a-\u03b2-catenin signaling. Proteins IGFBP1, -2, and -6 are also able to bind LRP6 and Frizzled-8, but they are only slightly expressed in heart. ",

Activation of members of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily thus follows their liberation from latency. 43 The prodomain of Nodal, which links to Cripto, is cleaved by peptidases secreted by neighboring cells [351] . Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone is secreted mostly uncleaved; its prodomain potentiates its activity. Protein Lefty is cleaved to enable access of the growth-factor domain to its receptors. 44 Many members of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily remain associated with their prodomains after secretion, such as BMP4, BMP7, BMP10, GDF2, GDF5 and GDF8. Many of these prodomains bind to fibrillin-1 and -2. Binding to LTBPs or fibrillins strengthens the latent prodomain-growth factor complex [351] .",

Seven BMP antagonists of the DAN family have been identified in rodents, such as tumor suppressor DAN, head-inducing factor Cerberus-related protein Cer1, gremlin, protein related to DAN and Cerberus (PRDC). Some members of the Cerberus-DAN family are implicated in left-right patterning owing to their asymmetrical distribution. Unlike Lefty proteins, DAN family members bind directly to extracellular Nodal and prevent signaling. Cerberus-related protein Cer1 51 antagonizes GDF5, GDF6, and GDF7 factors (Table 3 .15).",

Once stimulated by chemicals, VEGF quickly binds VEGFR2, recruiting in particular adaptor NCK\u03b2 to trigger the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; Vol. 3 -Chap. 5. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Modules) pathway. 83 Mechanical stimuli, such as wall shear stress, activate similar plasmalemmal targets (e.g., integrins and VEGFR2) and effectors (e.g., extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases and Jun N-terminal kinases). These convergent modules of the pathway triggered by mechanical and chemical stimuli then require insulation by different molecular complexes to keep their specificity, i.e., to possess divergent modules responsible for the specific response to different stimuli. VEGF, but not shear stress, induces the formation of a VEGFR2-NCK\u03b2 complex (Fig. 3.3) [387]. The wall shear stress activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase via VEGFR2 and recruitment of CBL adaptor, but not NCK\u03b2. 84 It bypasses VEGFR2 phosphorylation for JNK activation, but uses small GTPases Rho, and Src, PI3K, and RoCK kinases. Angiogenesis is achieved by the concerted migration and proliferation of endothelial and mural cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells). Endothelial cells form new vessels, whereas mural cells support and stabilize nascent vessels. However, upon stimulation of mural cells by PDGF to initiate angiogenesis by releasing pro-angiogenic mediators, in the presence of synergistic stimulation of VEGF and PDGF, VEGF is able to impede neovessel maturation, as it can ablate pericyte coverage of nascent vascular sprouts and hence destabilize these nascent vessels [388] . During PDGF-VEGF costimulation, VEGF activates VEGFR2 that suppresses PDGFR\u03b2 signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells, as VEGF induces the formation of VEGFR2-PDGFR\u03b2 complex. Dual expression of PDGFR\u03b2 and VEGFR2 is limited to \u03b1-smooth muscle actin+ perivascular cells. Inhibition of VEGFR2 prevents assembly of this receptor complex. In the case of joint exposure to both VEGF and PDGF, an antagonistic competition occurs between these 2 factors, as they both combine with FGF2. Tumors express high VEGF levels and develop tortuous, leaky, immature blood vessels with minimal pericyte coverage due to coexpression of VEGFR2 and PDGFR\u03b2 on perivascular cells. Anti-VEGF therapy normalizes tumor vasculature, hence accelerating tumor growth, but allows efficient delivery of cytotoxic agents.",

Increased leptin activity in the arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus inhibits the production of neuropeptide-Y in the paraventricular nucleus, thereby reducing feeding. 117 Somatotrope neurons have leptin receptors. Leptin can thus be an autocrine or paracrine regulator. 118 Leptin receptor is expressed at low levels in manifold tissues, but at high levels in the mediobasal hypothalamus, particularly in the arcuate, ventromedial, dorsomedial, and ventral premamillary hypothalamic nuclei [451] .

In addition, leptin increases catecholamine (adrenaline and noradrenaline) secretion by acting on the ventromedial hypothalamus, but not on hypothalamic arcuate, paraventricular, and dorsomedial nuclei, to prime a sympathetic activation [453] . Leptin controls cell metabolism via its actions in the hypothalamus and peripheral organs.

Leptin's excitation modifies glomerular perfusion and sodium excretion. Impaired leptin function in vascular cells can facilitate onset of hypertension. In vitro, leptin stimulates the proliferation and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells and their production of matrix metallopeptidase MMP2. It can then alter arterial wall remodeling.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 contribute in many cell types to IL10 synthesis. In macrophages, positive and negative feedback loops regulate IL10 production [501] . 147 Interleukin-10 hinders the synthesis of T H1 -derived (IL2, Ifn\u03b3, and gm-CSF) and monocyte-derived (IL1\u03b1 and -\u03b2, IL6, IL8, TNF\u03b1, gmCSF, and gCSF) cytokines, but induces IL1Ra production by macrophages. Interleukin-10 can prevent monocyte differentiation into type-1 dendritic cells, the most important antigen-presenting cells. In the presence of monocytes and/or macrophages, IL10 precludes the proliferation of resting T cells, the reduced proliferation being only partially due to decreased IL2 production. Interleukin-10 146 Transcription factors Specific protein SP1, Activating transcription factor ATF1, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein C/EBP\u03b2, cAMP-responsive-element-binding protein (CREB), Ifn-regulatory factor IRF1, nuclear factor-\u03baB, and signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT3 transactivate the Il10 gene in macrophages and T-cell lines [501] . In addition, 2 cofactors of the homeobox (HOX) family, pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor PBx1 and PBX-regulating protein PReP1, cause IL10 expression in mouse macrophages. In TH1 cells, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog SMAD4 and musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma proto-oncogene homolog (MAF) promote IL10 synthesis. In TH2 cells, MAF, Jun and GATA-binding protein GATA3 elicits IL10 expression. 147 Signaling pathways based on kinases P38MAPK and ERKs that provoke IL10 production are controlled by interferon-\u03b3 and IL10 itself. The latter stimulates dual-specificity protein phosphatase DUSP1 that impedes P38MAPK action. On the other hand, IL10 upregulates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase MAP3K8 to amplify its own production. In addition, Ifn\u03b3 can also block the PI3K-PKB pathway, thereby relieving the inhibtion on glycogen synthase kinase GSK3. The latter suppresses IL10 expression via cAMP response elementbinding protein (CREB) and Activator protein-1. ",

It produces interferon-\u03b3 (Ifn\u03b3). Polarization into TH1 is primarily due to interleukin-12 (IL12) and interferon-\u03b3. Repression by TGF\u03b2 of TH1 cell differentiation is associated with reduced expression of IL12 receptor subunit IL12R\u03b22 and T-cell-specific T-box TBx21 transcription factor. The TH2 cell is involved in the elimination of parasitic infections. It synthesizes interleukins IL4, IL5, IL10, and IL13 that stimulate the synthesis in B lymphocytes of immunoglobulin IgE, recruits eosinophils, and promotes mucus production and hypermotility, respectively. Maturation of TH2 cells is primarily directed by IL4. Differentiation of TH17 cells is initiated by IL6 and TGF\u03b2 and mediated by STAT3 agent. Factor STAT3 fosters the production of nuclear receptor NR1f3-2 (or ROR\u03b32) that supports TH17-cell differentiation by stimulating IL23 receptor. The TH17 cell secretes IL17a, IL17f, IL21, and IL22. Agent IL23 contributes to the maturation and maintenance of TH17 cells. Once activated by TGF\u03b2, FoxP3 antagonizes NR1f3-2, which is also stimulated by TGF\u03b2, to inhibit TH17-cell differentiation (in the absence of signaling from IL6 and STAT3). Differentiation into induced FoxP3+, regulatory T cells (iTReg) involves TGF\u03b2 and relies on FoxP3 and SMAD factors. These transcription factors are a major source of active TGF\u03b2 in iTReg cells.",

It also associates with other proteins, such as P21activated kinase, thereby serving as a docking protein to expose the protein to its activators (CDC42 and Rac1 for PAK). Adaptor NCK\u03b2 can then lead to the stimulation of effectors ERK and JNK kinases of the MAPK cascade. 84 Wall shear stress can stimulate ERK via manifold proteins, such as integrins, PECAM1, FAK, Src, and PKC .
