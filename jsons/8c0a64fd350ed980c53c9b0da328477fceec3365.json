Publications change the prior art, thus affecting patentability. Firms publish when they are behind in the race and their rival is close to winning it. Publication sets back both competitors and gives the follower a chance to catch up. Publications prolong the race. Firms are more likely to publish the more patient they are, and the higher their probability of success. Asymmetry between the firms generates additional incentives to publish such as protecting profits from a previous patent and increasing a strong firm's probability of winning. When firms face a joint decision on publications and the intensity of research, publications substitute investment.",

Although patent races have received considerable attention in the economic literature, the strategic use of publications in innovation races has not. This paper focuses on one important reason for public disclosure of research results: defensive publication. Publishing details of their research findings, firms establish new prior art and thus strategically affect the patentability of related innovations. Firms can use publications to defend their own inventions from being patented by another company and to increase their probability of leapfrogging the leader and winning the race.",

            "text": "Typically, profit-maximizing firms either seek patent protection for their innovations or keep them secret from rivals. Detailed technical disclosures may reveal information to rivals without providing the publishing firm intellectual property rights. Interestingly we find that firms' strategic behavior involves publications that disclose research findings. The main novelty of this paper is in identifying a role for publications in a dynamic R&D model. Importantly, and in contrast to most previous economic models of R&D races, in this paper, the state of the prior art is endogenous. 1 A firm's progress is compared not only to its rival's progress but also to the state of the prior art.",

            "text": "Legally, to be entitled for patent protection, claims must define a useful, novel, nonobvious, and enabled invention. An invention must sufficiently improve upon the prior state of the art. Patent examiners review and analyze patent applications in conjunction with the state of the prior art. According to the Manual of Patent Examining Procedures: \"By far the most frequent ground of rejection is on the ground of unpatentability in view of the prior art.\" 2 Detailed publications regarding an innovation become part of the prior art and affect the patentability of related innovation. As a recent New York Times article points out, \"Such disclosure, known as defensive publishing, is an increasingly common tactic for protecting intellectual property.\" 3 As is evident from the existence of commercial services for defensive publications, 4 firms use defensive publishing as part of their business strategy. Many leading companies publish research disclosures. 5 Baker and Mezzetti (2005) in a case study of IBM's disclosures, find that approximately one out of six patents issued to IBM cite as prior art at least one article from the IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin and most of these patents cite articles published less than 5 years earlier. They interpret this finding as evidence that IBM is often disclosing information about patents that it is actively pursuing. 6 Note that during this same time (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) more than 75% of the patents that cited IBM's Bulletin were patents assigned to other companies (e.g. Apple Computers, Compaq Computer Corporation, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Texas Instruments) indicating that these disclosures were also relevant to their competitors' research. 7 Following Baker and Mezzetti's (2005) insight, that prior art references to research disclosures in an issued patent may point to a race with strategic disclosure, we looked for a specific example involving competing innovating firms. Note that if defensive publications are successful, we shouldn't expect to observe preempted patents but rather delayed patents. In 1992 AGFA published in the journal Research Disclosure a disclosure titled: \"A Lithographic Printing Plate.\" 8 In 1997 Kodak filed for a utility patent titled \"Direct write lithographic printing plates,\" which provides a prior art reference to AGFA's disclosure. 9 In 1995, AGFA itself also filed for a related patent citing the same disclosure. 10 The model provides a possible explanation for AGFA's publication. The companies engaged in closely related research. If AGFA suspected that Kodak may be close to patenting the technology, publishing could have forestalled it and thus was worthwhile even though AGFA intended to continue pursuing a patent. 11 According to Eisenberg (2000) who studied public disclosure of genomic information, It might even be possible for a firm that is lagging in a race to forestall the patent claims of a swifter rival through publications that enrich the prior art enough to limit what may be patented in the future. This possibility might explain why it is often the laggards rather than the leaders in DNA sequencing races that sing the praise of the public domain. 12 (p. 72) 7.

Moreover, such disclosure may have been patentable. Nevertheless, for the intuition in this paper to apply the important point is that the \"prize\" from the innovation was to be had only after more significant progress was made and that publication may have prolonged the race This paper models the use of defensive publications in an R&D race. In particular it explains why followers (laggards) publish. In the model two firms are engaged in a multistage patent race. To win the race, a firm needs to be the first to accomplish n discrete steps above the prevailing prior art. The winner of the race enjoys a prize while the loser obtains no payoff but incurs the loss of its R&D investment. Publication alters the state of the prior art so that more innovation steps are required. It sets back both competitors relative to their goal of advancing n steps above the state of the prior art. In other words, the race that we consider has no fixed finish line. Firms' progress and the state of the prior art are observed. There is uncertainty with respect to R&D, which is modeled as a Poisson process. To emphasize the defensive purpose of research disclosure, publications are assumed to have no direct payoff, and firms do not possess market power over an innovation once it is made public.",

In a symmetric race, in a Markov perfect equilibrium a competitor who is behind in the race publishes research results in order to set back the leader when the leader is very close to obtaining a patent. Because publishing prolongs the race and delays the prize, the follower will want to wait for as long as possible before publishing. By doing so the follower avoids unnecessary publications in the event he makes favorable progress in R&D. For the same reason, the follower will choose to publish the least possible to prevent the competitor from winning, and will do so only when he is far enough behind.

This condition holds true when, for example, there is no discounting. As c 0 \u2192 \u221e, the values of the game converge to the values in the fixed hazard rate model. Thus, the follower has an incentive to publish when the leader is close to the end of the race. Intuitively, followers can increase their chances of catching up either by putting in more effort or by publishing. Thus, defensive publications can substitute for investment and are therefore more likely when the marginal cost of R&D is high.

The premise for both papers is that publications increase the state of the prior art, prolong the race, and make patenting more difficult. However, the papers explore the use of strategic disclosure in different environments, and hence reach different conclusions. In Baker and Mezzetti a race between firms M and N takes place in three periods. In period 1, only firm M can conduct research and disclose. In period 2, only firm N can conduct research and disclose, and in the final period, only firm M moves again. Throughout period 2, in which firm N conducts research, obtains results, and decides on disclosure, its rival cannot act. In particular, regardless of how close firm M is to the finish line, its probability of winning in period 2 is zero. Thus, their results are most applicable for situations in which a firm has achieved some nonpatentable progress but expects a delay before it can begin pursuing the next milestone. A continuous-time, simultaneousmove game as in our paper is, we believe, a more natural way to model an R&D race. Here both competitors can revise their actions at any stage of the ongoing race. Baker and Mezzetti's (2005) first proposition states: \"The disclosing firm's optimal level of disclosure increases with m, the knowledge of the disclosing firm. This is true no matter whether the disclosing firm leads or trails in the race.\" This result, which contradicts ours (see Propositions 1 and 3) seems to depend on the fact that in period 2 firm M has a zero probability of success. Consider, for example, a situation in which M is very close to winning the race, and N is behind. According to Baker and Mezzetti the leader M would publish to make it more difficult for N to win in period 2, when only N could win. In our model, the leader has a high probability of winning at any time. Hence, it has no incentive to publish in this situation. In Baker and Mezzetti the follower N would not publish in this situation since the game ends in period 3. In our model the follower, taking into account that the leader is close to winning the race, would gain from publishing.",

They note that \"none of the above intuitions requires any specific assumption as to whether the disclosing firm leads or lags in the race. Thus all of the propositions explicitly apply to both leader and laggard firms.\" In fact, since they analyze a three-period sequential game, it is always firm M (whether leader or follower) that may publish and only in period 1. Its rival firm N can't benefit from publishing since this is its last move before the game ends.

Baker and Mezzetti's (2005) assumptions on the stochastic process are less restrictive. In Baker and Mezzetti information is a continuous variable thus even an infinitesimal level of disclosure raises the patentability bar. In this paper, research progresses in discrete steps so only sufficient disclosure affects patentability. When extending the model to include investment, their work focuses on comparing the amount of information disclosed when investment is and isn't possible. This paper focuses on different issues. We maintain assumptions commonly made in the economic literature on patent races allowing a comparison with the standard literature. We show that publishing can substitute investment as the marginal costs of investment rise. Scotchmer and Green (1990) explain that the social goal of protecting profits is served by a strong novelty requirement while the goal of disclosure is served by a weak novelty requirement. O'Donoghue (1998) also suggests that a strong patentability requirement can stimulate R&D investment and enhance welfare. We showed that a strong patentability requirement may give rise to defensive publications, so that contradicting welfare effects are present: on the one hand, information disclosure, free of market power; on the other hand, possibly less incentive to invest and more inefficient duplication.",

But recently there have been calls to strengthen the patentability requirements. 30 This in terms of our model increases n and could give rise to more defensive publications. Even with a weak patentability requirement, the intuition in this paper can have important implications. Leading firms might prefer not to patent interim technologies 31 but the threat of follower's publications might induce leaders to do so.",

Even if a firm's goal is not to patent an innovation, they likely have the goal of getting \"credit\" for the work (media attention, professional recognition, etc.) and if to get credit you must have a sufficient advance beyond what's already in the public domain, then the basic ideas of the paper would still hold. Consider the following example: two companies share a market for some service and are making zero profits. There is a cost to consumers in switching service providers, thus a firm could capture the whole market only if it offers a sufficiently improved service (n steps). Smaller improvements would not make consumers switch, but can raise the bar. If a leader is close to introducing n steps, the follower would (if he can) defensively improve by a step. The method and intuitions we developed apply also to other versions of our model: one in which any published step sets both competitors back to the beginning, and a new innovation race begins; or one where a minimum of k steps disclosure is needed to raise the bar.",

Firms sometimes obtain information about their rival's research progress, but some level of asymmetric information likely exists. Asymmetric information would be significantly more difficult to analyze since strategies would depend on beliefs that change over time.

If there exists another equilibrium, firms publish more than in the proposed equilibrium. Therefore, at some state for some firm, the expected expenses would be higher.
