As a result, there is a critical need for rapid and continuously updated access to the latest molecular data in a format in which all data can be quickly cross-referenced and compared. We adapted our genome browser visualization tool to the viral genome for this purpose. Molecular data, curated from published studies or from database submissions, are mapped to the viral genome and grouped together into \"annotation tracks\" where they can be visualized along the linear map of the viral genome sequence and programmatically downloaded in standard format for analysis.",

This reference sequence is the RNA genome isolated from one of the first cases in Wuhan and is known as \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome\" . This sequence is widely used as a standard reference, and, because of its early identification, it is used as the root genome in phylogenetic trees produced by Nextstrain (Hadfield et al., 2018) , The COG-UK and the China National Center for Bioinformation project . Above this image are the Navigation controls. Buttons in the navigation controls allow the user to move left and right along the genomic sequence and zoom in and out by various factors. Clicking the zoom factor \"base\" zooms in to show the nucleotide bases in the selected region. The Position Bar shows the current region of the genome being viewed via a red box, and the Search Box allows a user to manually enter a specific position to view. Coordinates in the Position Bar should be entered with the prefix NC_045512v2 (the NCBI RefSeq accession of this genome) followed by the stop and start nucleotide numbers (e.g. \" NC_045512v2:25, 401\") .

In infected cells, the first gene (orf1a/orf1ab) is directly translated and cleaved into proteins that form the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) (Nakagawa et al., 2016) . These RTCs then use the same positive-strand RNA genome as a template to generate negatively stranded RNAs that will serve as templates for additional positive-strand mRNAs. During negative-strand transcription, RTCs will occasionally encounter a body transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-B). These occur at various positions within the viral genome. These sequences work in combination with a single leader transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-L) at the 5' end of the genome. When RTCs encounter a TRS-B sequence, they can \"jump\" to the TRS-L sequence, thereby generating a negative-strand RNA that omits a large portion of the genome ( Figure 3 ) (Sola et al., 2015) . These negative-strand RNAs then serve as templates for transcription of positive-strand subgenomic mRNAs. . Positive-strand subgenomic RNAs created by this mechanism now have downstream AUGs in an optimal start codon context, allowing ribosomes to initiate translation at locations normally not available in the full length genomic RNA. These subgenomic RNAs serve as mRNAs for viral proteins encoded downstream in the genome.",

Although discontinuous transcription is mechanistically quite distinct from eukaryotic splicing, we annotate the \"jump\" from a TRS-B to the TRS-L in a manner analogous to introns, as this allows proper interpretation of the transcript.

These (-) strands then serve as templates for positive transcription from the TRS-L to generate a variety of viral mRNAs that produce different viral proteins. B) A simple, compact and machine-readable genomic visualization for this complex biological process. (Top) All viral mRNA species are shown as annotations on the reference genome. Black bars represent nucleotides present in an mRNA species while arrows represent the sequence that has been skipped during discontinuous transcription. Thick black bars represent the coding sequence predicted to be translated in these RNA species. (Middle) The core TRS motif, ACGAAC, annotated on the genome, corresponds to transcript junctions. (Bottom) Experimental data representing breakpoints that are fusions of TRS-B to TRS-L sequence identified by Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing . High peaks indicate that the 5' TRS-L sequence is found directly upstream of the annotated bases in viral RNAs. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome SARS-CoV-2 proteome consists of 2 polyproteins, 4 structural proteins, and possibly 9 accessory proteins (Brian & Baric, 2005; Fehr & Perlman, 2015; Wu et al., 2020) . The two polyproteins are processed into 16 non-structural proteins, leading to as many as 29 proteins that should be considered when performing analyses ( Figure 4 ). Proteins pp1a and pp1ab are polyproteins that are products of ORF1a and ORF1ab respectively which are both produced by translation of the full length genomic RNA. To generate pp1a the ribosome initiates translation at the AUG at nucleotides 266-268. Translation continues in the canonical manner until a UAA stop codon is encountered at nucleotides 13,481-13,483. That produces the 4405 amino acid pp1a polyprotein. This polyprotein contains within itself two viral proteases (nsp3/PL-PRO) and (nsp5/3CL-PRO) that cleave the pp1a polyprotein into 11 mature non-structural proteins (nsp1-11, see Figure 4 ) (Barretto et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2020 ) (Barretto et al., 2005) . The pp1ab polyprotein is generated by initiating translation at the same start codon as pp1a; however, the viral RNA contains within it a \"slippery\" sequence and structured RNA element that occasionally causes the translation machinery to slip near nucleotide C13468 and therefore read this nucleotide twice: once as the final nucleotide in the AAC codon for amino acid N4401, and once again as the first nucleotide in the CGG codon for amino acid R4402) (Bekaert & Rousset, 2005; Plant & Dinman, 2006) . The result is a \"programmed\" -1 frameshift that means the pp1a \"stop\" codon is no longer in frame, lengthening pp1ab by 2695 entirely different amino acids. These additional amino acids encode essential non-structural proteins, (Figures 3 and 4) , meaning that pp1ab encodes nsp1-10 as well as nsp12-16. In order to properly display this frameshift on the genome browser, we use specialized colored codons that lead to faithful translation of each ORF ( Figure 5 ). (Plant & Dinman, 2006) ) the ribosome will slip due to the highly structured frameshifting element (depicted here as a simple cartoon stem loop) with the bound tRNAs slipping -1 nucleotide, and causing C13468 to remain in the A site of the ribosome. This results in +2 movement along the mRNA and an overall -1 frameshift. Therefore the next codon read is CGG and R4402 is added. Since the pp1a stop codon at 4406 is no longer in frame, ~2700 additional amino acids encoding nsp12-16 are added to the polyprotein.",

C) Structure of the immunogenic peptide YQDVNCTEV in complex with HLA-A*02:01. D614 (red) is nestled within the binding groove, leading to a hypothesis that the G614 mutation may alter binding. Note that although browser-based comparisons of this data lend insight into possible models for the increased frequency of G614, further evolutionary and experimental analyses are required to make definitive statements about the functional consequences of this mutation. (Live Interactive Session: http://genome.ucsc.edu/s/SARS_CoV2/Figure7 ) Comparative Genomics: This group contains two tracks that show multiple alignments built from sequences provided by NCBI/INSDC: 1) \"119 Vertebrate CoVs\", an alignment of 119 sequences, most of which are human coronaviruses (though not necessarily SARS-CoV-2), with various animal viruses and 2) \"44 Bat CoVs\", an alignment of 44 various bat coronaviruses most closely related to human SARS CoV-2. The mutations in the alignments are colored by their effect on the protein (white: no difference, red:nonsynonymous, green:synonymous, blue:noncoding, yellow:missing data due to unalignable, absent or unknown sequence). Analysis of evolutionary rates derived from comparative genomics, including insertions and deletions, can pinpoint functionally interesting sections of the viral genome. For instance, comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with less pathogenic coronaviruses suggest features of the genome that may be related to increased pathogenicity (Gussow et al., 2020) . Features identified in that analysis currently appear in the Crowd-sourced annotations track, but will eventually be displayed in the Comparative Genomics group. Similarly, comparison of coronaviruses across species and across host genomes can clearly illustrate evolutionary features such as accelerated evolution at receptor-spike binding regions (Figure 8 ) (Demogines et al., 2012) .

The tree is shown in pack and squish views. Dense and full mode display the frequencies at which these variants are found (data not shown). In the tree, samples are sorted according to their order in the JSON file produced by Nextstrain describing the phylogenetic tree, and appear in different colors according to clades identified by Nextstrain. Because data were collected by GISAID from labs all over the world the mutation calls do contain occasional errors. To avoid noise in the display, tools are provided to filter these data to show only the well-supported mutation calls. Additional filters allow users to set thresholds for minor allele frequency and to display data for specific clades. Custom tracks: Users can add annotations for their own use or to share with other groups by clicking the \"Custom tracks\" button. Annotation data can be pasted directly into a text box (e.g. entering \"NC_045512v2 509 515 binding-site\" and clicking \"Submit\" will show an annotation at the nucleotide position 510-515 with the label \"binding-site\") or annotations can be uploaded in a standard genomic file format.

The Position Bar shows a highlighted red box illustrating the current portion of the genome being viewed. The Search Box allows users to search for particular features or to move to exact genomic coordinates. The RNA sequence is only shown when sufficiently zoomed in. Annotations are shown for data tracks that have been set to visible. Here, the NCBI Genes track shows the annotation of the end of the Spike (S) protein and the start of ORF3a, as well as the amino acid translation of their codons. Below that a track showing recurrent SARS-CoV-2 variants that have been observed around the world as reported by nextstrain.org. Bar graphs show the frequency of each allele and mouseover gives the counts of each allele. The next track (Bat CoV multiz) shows a multiple alignment of 44 bat coronaviruses aligned to the reference. Overall these viruses align well to this region of SARS-CoV-2 (the dot means the amino acid is identical) although one non-synonymous substitution (S1261P) is observed in one virus, Rs9401. The final track shows a CD8 positive epitope from IEDB (see Figure 7 for additional details). Tracks can be configured with a right-click or alternatively by clicking on their name near the bottom of the page. Only 12 of the 48 currently available track configuration buttons are shown in this figure due to space limitations. Custom data tracks generated by users can be added directly via the \"add custom tracks\" button. Additional options can be set via the Menu bar at the top (e.g. the \"View\" menu allows additional changes to the browser window).

Also shown are two sites in the S (Spike) protein (furin_like_cleavage and fusion_peptide_cleavage) that are recognized by host cellular proteases instead of the above two viral proteases. Cleavage of coronavirus Spike protein generates mature subunits that allow the virus to enter cells. (Below) Cartoon representation showing abstractly the cleavage of polyprotein peptide sequences by the viral proteases to generate mature proteins. The viral polyproteins are cleaved by the PL-PRO protease at 3 locations that match the amino acid pattern LXGGX (X = any amino acid) as indicated; 3CL-PRO cleaves many more sites, typically at the pattern LQSAG as shown.
