Methods and Results: We genetically engineered the L. plantarum strains pPG612-VP2/LP and pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP constitutively expressing the VP2 protein of vvIBDV. We found that the T7g10 enhancer efficiently upregulates VP2 expression in pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP. Orally administered, pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP exhibited significant levels of protection (87\u00c15%) against vvIBDV in chickens, indicating improved immunogenicity. Chickens in the pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP group produced higher levels of interferons (IFN-c) and interleukins (IL-2 and IL-4) than those in the pPG612-VP2/LP group. CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocyte counts indicated greater stimulation in the pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP group (13\u00c13 and 21\u00c10% respectively) than in the pPG612-VP2/LP group (10\u00c14 and 14\u00c10% respectively). Thus, pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP could induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses against vvIBDV. Conclusions: The recombinant L. plantarum that expresses pPG612-T7g10-VP2 is a promising candidate for oral vaccine development against vvIBDV.

IBDV belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus of the family Birnaviridae that are nonenveloped, icosahedral doublestranded RNA viruses enclosing two segments, A and B (Azad et al. 1985) . The short segment B (2\u00c18 kb) comprises viral protein 1 (VP1, 'an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase'; 97 kDa; Macreadie and Azad 1993) , while segment A (3\u00c117 kb) encodes the major components of the virus and contains two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs; Spies et al. 1989; Kibenge et al. 1991 ). The first ORF encodes the nonstructural viral protein VP5 (17 kDa) and the second ORF encodes a polyprotein precursor (pVP2-VP4-VP3, 110 kDa) that can be trans-cleaved by VP4 (28 kDa) to release pVP2 (512 residues, 54\u00c14 kDa) and VP3 (32 kDa) (Lejal et al. 2000) . The puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PurSA) and VP4 cleave pVP2 at its C-terminus to produce the transitional pVP2 (452 residues) (Irigoyen et al. 2012) . pVP2 is further cleaved to produce the mature VP2 (441 residues) (Saugar et al. 2005; Irigoyen et al. 2009 ). VP2 (206 to 350 aa residues) is encoded by the hypervariable region (HVR) of IBDV and is responsible for antigenic variation (Vakharia et al. 1994) . In addition to homologous recombination in segments, mutations in the HVR of VP2 and genetic reassortment events are also responsible for the variation in IBDV (Islam et al. 2001; Wei et al. 2006; He et al. 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 270, "end": 288, "text": "(Azad et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 395, "end": 419, "text": "Macreadie and Azad 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 556, "end": 574, "text": "Spies et al. 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 575, "end": 594, "text": "Kibenge et al. 1991", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 840, "end": 859, "text": "(Lejal et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 995, "end": 1017, "text": "(Irigoyen et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1105, "text": "(Saugar et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1126, "text": "Irigoyen et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1277, "text": "(Vakharia et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1459, "text": "(Islam et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1476, "text": "Wei et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1491, "text": "He et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Replication of IBDV is promoted by chondroitin sulphate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-2 (CSGalNAcT2), a type II transmembrane protein, which is located in the Golgi apparatus and aids viral glycosylation (Zhang et al. 2015) . The structural VP2 protein in IBDV is considered a significant host-protective antigen. Indeed, vaccination with VP2 was able to induce protection against IBDV (Fahey et al. 1989 ). VP2 consists of at least two neutralizing epitopes and assists in the activation of virus-neutralizing antibodies in chickens to protect them from vvIBDV.

Due to the evolution of new strain variants, the traditional practice of using inactivated or attenuated vaccines has become less effective in controlling IBDV. However, compared to traditional vaccines, the recombinant vaccines adopted against IBDV have successfully minimized the risk of induction of bursal pathology or the reversal to virulence. In addition, recombinant vaccines are also helpful in providing protection against multiple infectious agents, reducing stress in vaccinated birds, and decreasing labour and vaccination costs (Mahgoub 2012) . Thus, recombinant vaccines offer several advantages to the poultry industry, where vaccination is practiced extensively. IBDV recombinant vaccines with VP2 proteins have been developed using different methods and expression systems.

A PgsA anchor-VP2 fusion protein of approximately 90 kDa size (45 kDa of the PgsA anchor and 44 kDa of VP2 protein) was detected in both recombinant Lactobacillus strains and compared to the positive control (pPG612-VP2/Lactobacillus casei 393). The highest level of VP2 protein was expressed in pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP followed by the pPG612-VP2/LP strain, and no expression was observed in the pP612/LP (Fig. 2) .

Vaccines available in the market show partial defence against virulent and highly virulent IBDV strains. Previously, several studies have reported that DNA-based vaccines successfully induced cellular and humoral immune responses against pathogens (Kodihalli et al. 1999; Fan et al. 2002; Serezani et al. 2002) . Deoxyribonucleic acid vaccines against IBDV that employed the VP2 protein have been shown to induce antibody production, but the expression and protection conferred have been found to vary (Becht et al. 1988 ). In the current study, we evaluated the immune response to VP2 protein expressed on the surface of bacteria using the HCE-PgsA system, since higher immunological responses have been reported from surface-displayed antigens compared with intracellularly secreted antigens (Stover et al. 1993; Jong-Soo et al. 2000; Grode et al. 2002) . Lee et al. (2006) reported both systemic and mucosal immune responses against acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus with the S antigen (SARS-CoV S) using the PgsA system in the L. casei expression system. OprF (a dominant outer membrane protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa), FadL (an outer membrane protein involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids in E. coli) and PgsA have all been used as anchor proteins (Poo et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2004 Lee et al. , 2005 , but PgsA has been shown to be a better anchor for lactic acid bacteria. However, to date, no candidate vaccine against vvIBDV has been developed using the HCE-PgsA system. Therefore, we tested the PgsA gene product as an anchor for the surface display of antigens. The HCE-PgsA system has been used in vaccine development against tumours and influenza viruses, showing positive results. However, it has been reported that the HCE-PgsA system expresses low levels of recombinant protein ). Therefore, we introduced an extra-ribosomal binding site (RBS) T7g10 (enhancer) in the HCE-PgsA system and compared VP2 protein expression and protection against vvIBDV in the presence and absence of this enhancer. This synthetic sequence was derived from gene 10 of bacteriophage T7 called 'Epsilon' (enhancer of protein synthesis initiation) (Olins and Rangwala 1989) . It has been reported that this sequence can improve the expression of poorly expressed heterologous genes. Studies have proven that the efficacy of gene 10 is due to the presence of a nine-base sequence upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno region. It has been documented that T7g10-derived RBS displays 40-fold greater expression than the typical RBS. Mammalian, plant and bacterial proteins have been expressed at high levels by the construction of a plasmid vector with a T7g10 leader sequence (Olins et al. 1988 ). To express the antigenic protein on the surface of bacteria, antigenic proteins should be fused with an anchor protein that is naturally expressed on the surface of the bacteria. Therefore, we constructed two recombinant surface-displayed expression vectors, pPG612-VP2 and pPG612-T7g10-VP2, expressed in L. plantarum. In this study, indirect immunofluorescence confirmed VP2 protein expression on the surface of the recombinant bacteria. We used the translational enhancer T7g10 to enhance the constitutive protein expression of the vector. Expression analysis by Western blot indicated that pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP expressed higher levels of VP2 protein when compared to pPG612-VP2/LP and pPG612/LP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 335, "end": 358, "text": "(Kodihalli et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 359, "end": 375, "text": "Fan et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 376, "end": 397, "text": "Serezani et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 589, "end": 607, "text": "(Becht et al. 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 881, "end": 901, "text": "(Stover et al. 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 902, "end": 923, "text": "Jong-Soo et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 924, "end": 942, "text": "Grode et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 945, "end": 962, "text": "Lee et al.

In this study, we determined that the recombinant Lactobacillus delivery system induces a strong antibody response in both the pPG612-VP2/LP-and pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LPtreated groups. Moreover, the immune response to pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP was significantly higher (P < 0\u00c105) than to pPG612-VP2/LP. We also determined the bursal/body weight ratio (B/B ratio), survival and protective rates against IBDV challenge. The B/B ratios of the pPG612-VP2/LP and pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP groups were both significantly higher than that of the pPG612/LP group (P < 0\u00c101), and the value of the pPG612-T7g10-VP2/L group was significantly higher than that of the pPG612-VP2/L group (P < 0\u00c105). Although the protection rate of the pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP group was higher than that of the pPG612-VP2/LP group (87\u00c15 vs 75%), no significant difference was found between the two groups, which may be caused by the small sample size in this study. It has been proven that not only the humoral immune response but also the cellular immune response mediated by T cells plays a significant role in the control of vvIBDV infection (Rautenschlein et al. 2002) . During the IBDV replication phase, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells show an influx into the BF (the site of virus replication) and other adjacent lymphoid organs such as the caecal tonsils and the spleen (Sharma et al. 1989; Kim et al. 1999 Kim et al. , 2000 . We examined the effect of vaccination on T-cell responses upon viral attack, showing that the number of T cells significantly increased after virus infection. Cyclosporin A treatment was responsible for reducing circulating T cells and was involved in T-cell mitogenesis, which in turn was responsible for viral burden in the bursae of IBDV-infected chickens . T cell-mediated responses have a significant role in viral clearance and are involved in the recovery from viral infection . The cell-mediated immune system activates macrophages and natural killer cells in response to an antigen (Lukacs and Kurlander 1989; Harty and Bevan 1992) . In IBDV-infected chickens, there was an increase in the number of intrabursal T cells, while the bursae of uninfected chickens had very few resident T cells (Khan and Hashimoto 1996; L\u20ac utticken 1997; Kim et al. 1999 Kim et al. , 2000 . Our results indicate that T7g10 may be responsible for the increased expression of the VP2 protein, thereby increasing antibody production that in turn produces a strong humoral immune response and subsequently maximum protection from viral challenge. Furthermore, a greater amount of VP2 stimulates the cell-mediated immune response, which shows a better CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response. CD8+ T cells are cytotoxic T cells which are involved in the lysis of virally infected cells, tumour cells and allografts, and play a crucial role in the immune response (Sharma et al. 1989) . Upon activation, helper CD4+ T cells function as \"middlemen\" and trigger secretion and proliferation of various cytokines. Cytokine production regulates host responses. Th1 cells are responsible for the secretion of IFN-c and IL-2 cytokines and are involved in effective cell-mediated immunity leading to the successful elimination of intracellular pathogens (Kunzendorf et al. 1998) . Th2 cells are involved in the control of certain parasitic infections through the production of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 (Avery et al. 2004) . The bursa of virally infected chickens is involved in the activation of T cells and upregulates the expression of other cytokine genes such as IL-1b, IL-6 and IFN-c (Eldaghayes et al. 2006) . Cellular immune responses mediated by cytokines against vvIBDV in chickens are poorly illustrated and have not yet been broadly studied. In our study, higher concentrations of IFN-c, IL-2 and IL-4 cytokines were detected in pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP compared to pPG612-VP2/LP; among these, concentrations of IFN-c in pPG612-T7g10-VP2/LP were significantly higher (P < 0\u00c101) compared to pPG612-VP2/LP. IBDV-infected chickens had upregulated gamma interferon gene expression in spleen and bursal cells compared to virus-free chickens (Khan and Hashimoto 1996; L\u20ac utticken 1997) . It has been documented that IL-2 has a significant role in regulating the function and development of T cells (Malek 2003) . In mice, targeted deletion in the IL-2 gene has been shown to affect multiple target organs thus supporting that IL-2 plays a role in immunodeficiency and fatal autoimmune inflammatory disease (Schorle and Hunig 1991; K\u20ac undig et al. 1993; Sadlack et al. 1993 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 90, "end": 101, "text": "(Berg 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1224, "text": "(Rautenschlein et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1440, "text": "(Sharma et al. 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1456, "text": "Kim et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1474, "text": "Kim et al. , 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2095, "text": "(Lukacs and Kurlander 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2117, "text": "Harty and Bevan 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2277, "end": 2302, "text": "(Khan and Hashimoto 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2320, "text": "L\u20ac utticken 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2321, "end": 2336, "text": "Kim et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2354, "text": "Kim et al. , 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2914, "end": 2934, "text": "(Sharma et al. 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 3296, "end": 3320, "text": "(Kunzendorf et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3458, "end": 3477, "text": "(Avery et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3645, "end": 3669, "text": "(Eldaghayes et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 4198, "end": 4223, "text": "(Khan and Hashimoto 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 4224, "end": 4241, "text": "L\u20ac utticken 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4354, "end": 4366, "text": "(Malek 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 4562, "end": 4586, "text": "(Schorle and Hunig 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 4587, "end": 4608, "text": "K\u20ac undig et al. 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 4609, "end": 4628, "text": "Sadlack et al. 1993", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Th1 or Th2 cytokine production in vaccinated chickens is the outcome of an adaptive immune response.

Investigation of IL-4 is required for the understanding of the Th2 phenotype of lymphocytes and for regulating cell proliferation (Luzina et al. 2012 ).
