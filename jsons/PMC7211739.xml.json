The complications due to Covid infection are also more in people having other co morbidities like hypertension and cardio vascular diseases. Due to the pandemic, there has been a tremendous change in the healthcare system. Basic needs including health care supplements of masks, hand wash, hand sanitizers is needed for all and getting medications like OAD (Oral Antidiabetic drugs) and insulin is a challenge for people with Diabetes. Patients are not encouraged to visit the hospital until unless there is an emergency situation. Therefore coping with diabetes is a big task especially for elderly people with Diabetes and children with Type 1 Diabetes. The COVID -19 burdens also increases the anxiety among people with diabetes. The lockdown situation which may lead to unavailability of basic needs coupled with lack of support from their diabetes teams whom they usually meet, makes people with diabetes more vulnerable for stress and anxiety.",

Education among the patients about the use of SMBG and its importance are usually done on every visit of the patient to the clinic. From this study, we highlight the need for regular SMBG especially among patients with diabetes on insulin therapy during periods of pandemic when there is lockdown.
