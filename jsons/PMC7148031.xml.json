            "text": "Dualism denotes the state of two parts. The term was originally coined to denote co-eternal binary opposition and has been especially studied in philosophy. For example, there is duality in ethics (good - bad), in human beings (man - Nietzsche\u2019s \u00fcbermensch or man - god) and in logic (true - false). In addition, dualism determines in a great extent our everyday lives (ugly - beautiful, happy - unhappy, etc.), and our relations with other people (rich - poor, black - white, love - hate, etc.). None of these concepts can be understood without their dual concepts, since this duality and opposition generates their meaning and interpretation. Dualism is also crucial in mathematics and physics (e.g., matter - antimatter), and is the power behind our whole information society and our binary data.",

In general, the selection of the \u201cright\u201d antonyms raises various questions. In many cases more than one antonyms exist, so one should decide which one(s) to select. Sometimes this can depend on the context, e.g., the antonym of \u201caction\u201d is \u201capathy\u201d, but in terms of physics or sociology the dual of \u201caction\u201d is \u201creaction\u201d.",
