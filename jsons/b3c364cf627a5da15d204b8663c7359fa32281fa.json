As the global pandemic ensues, scientist are working to evaluate the virus and develop a vaccine to counteract the deadly disease that has impacted lives across the entire globe. We perform computational electrostatic simulations on multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) variants to examine differences in electrostatic interactions across the various complexes. Calculations are performed across the physiological pH range to also examine the impact of pH on these interactions. Two of six SARS-CoV-2 variations having greater electric forces at pH levels consistent with nasal secretions and significant variations in force across all five variants of ACE2. Five out of six SARS-CoV-2 variations have relatively consistent forces at pH levels of the lung, and one SARS-CoV-2 variant that has low potential across a wide range of pH. These predictions indicate that variants of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2 in certain combinations could potentially play a role in increased binding efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.",

We present results containing the highest and lowest potential differences from pH 4.5 to 9.0 in Figure 3 . This data shows an electric potential difference exists of varying quantity across all complex combinations evaluated. Furthermore, the pipeline data predicts that 's1' of CoV-2 is positively charged throughout the pH range while ACE2 has a transition to negative between pH 4.5 and 5.0 as show in Figure 4 .

Our model is non-specific in that specific interactions involve close-proximity contacts between proteins such as hydrogen bonds, unlike charges, and hydrophobic residue stacking. However, non-specific interactions are not closeproximity, and can be attractive or repulsive beyond the range of 3 angstroms or more. Electric force is a good example of the latter case. Details of the calculation are provided in the Methods section below. Figure 5 is a graph of all complexes that displays the Electric Force from pH 3.0 to 9.0 in 0.1 increments. Positive values indicate a repulsive force and negative values indicate an attractive force. We discard the repulsive forces on the basis that they exist outside the relevant pH range and the amplitude reduces clarity of the significant results. Figure 6 is the same information provided by Figure 5 with the repelling forces clipped. From this representation we can see unique characteristics emerging where a group of complexes stand out from the rest with low potential energy in a smooth curve across the examined range; another cluster of complexes emerges with a higher level of force in a slightly more erratic curve across the range and a group of complexes with a pronounced peak in force across the range of nasal secretions that peaks in the approximate middle.",

Furthermore, these results implicate human ACE2 variations that exacerbate those forces for specific 's1' and ACE2 combinations. Additionally, we point out that three groupings emerge in this analysis showing two 's1' variants with large spikes in force at pH 5.5 to 6.5 associated with nasal secretions. Three 's1' variants have a relatively smooth curve at nominal forces and one variation has a smooth curve with low force and minimal differences across ACE2 variations. While we are limited in the available crystal structures required to analyze through our pipeline, the current level of diversity allowed for detailed analysis adequate to express differences that expose potential alignments of increased force for certain combinations of CoV-2 and ACE2 variants. Additional crystal structures for other CoV-2 and ACE2 variants would allow for more precise predictions in these specific cases.",
