Applying a multivariate analysis to our patient population, patients with a cell dose of >1.0 \u00d7 108 TNC/kg experienced a significantly reduced 100-day mortality compared to those transplanted with a cell dose of <1.0 \u00d7 108 TNC/kg after adjusting for disease status and patient age at transplant. There was, however, no statistically significant difference in long-term EFS or overall survival between the two groups (P = 0.37, P = 0.49, respectively). Although a correlation between the dose of TNC/kg and engraftment with a peripheral blood granulocyte count of >0.5 \u00d7 109 was found (P = 0.01), no such relationship with platelet recovery could be established. Thus, in contrast to the report of Gorin et al46 we could not find any relationship between cell dose and long-term outcome.
