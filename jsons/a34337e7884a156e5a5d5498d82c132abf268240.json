This process uses a background component to represent primary accidents, and a self-exciting component to represent secondary accidents. The background consists of periodic daily and weekly components, a spatial component and a long-term trend. The self-exciting components are decaying, unidirectional functions of space and time. These components are determined via kernel smoothing and likelihood estimation. Temporally, the background is stable across seasons with a daily double peak structure reflecting commuting patterns.",

Nevertheless 1782 deaths and 25,484 serious injuries resulted from accidents on UK roads in 2018 Department for Transport (2019). Aside from the direct human cost of serious accidents, indirect economic costs result even from relatively minor incidents. This is because crashes, collisions and breakdowns can cause severe congestion leading to significant drops in the efficiency of the road transport network. For these reasons, there is a strong imperative to further reduce the accident rate on UK roads.",

Further rate reductions are therefore likely to require targeted interventions. Targeted interventions might try to to improve safety at specific locations where the accident risk is known to be high compared to the baseline or might try to mitigate against particular mechanisms that are known to account for a significant proportion of accidents. Infrastructure modifications to improve the safety of accidentprone junctions is an example of the first type of intervention. The deployment of the Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signalling (MIDAS) system to reduce the number of secondary accidents on motorways is an example of the second. Secondary accidents occur when when a driver fails to react appropriately to the disruption caused by an existing accident leading to a subsequent accident upstream of the first one.",

MIDAS is one component of the UK 'smart motorways' infrastructure, see Highways England (2020) . Smart motorways use modern sensing and communications technology to allow transport system operators to display messages to drivers, dynamically control speed limits and close lanes when needed to aid the control of traffic. Most of the data, including data on accidents and congestion, is publicly available via the National Traffic Information Service (NTIS). In this paper, we use data from NTIS to model the distribution of motorway incidents as a spatio-temporal Hawkes process, a type of self-exciting point process. We focus on the M25 London Orbital, one of the busiest motorways in the UK. The objectives of the study are two-fold. The first is to quantify how accident risk on the M25 varies in space and time relative to the baseline. The second is to use the self-excitation component of a Hawkes process to quantify the likely contribution of secondary incidents to the observed totals. We would like this model to be helpful in addressing the question of how best to target interventions when the baseline accident rate is low in absolute terms. We therefore perform extensive in-sample and out-of-sample validation to verify the models performance on seen and unseen data.",

They then furthered this by incorporating spatial components into an auto-regressive model, finding it improved upon models disregarding the spatial correlation in the data.

Whilst we also consider data from the U.K. we use a different time-period and focus on a much smaller region, a single motorway rather than the entire country. We also aim to model the dynamics as a point-process, not just discover locations of statistically significant clusters. Of-course, from our modelling, we can infer spatially and temporally where events are most common, but fundamentally our approach is different from this work.",

Here, logistic regression and random forest models were used to predict the likelihood of event occurrences. In-particular, the models incorporated a significant variable defined as 'cascading effect' in which the presence of an event showed significant influence on the likelihood of another nearby in space and time. Although a different type of model to the one we use, and different formulation, there is clearly a sense that cascading effects are a real component in some traffic data that one may want to incorporate into a model. It is unclear what time and length scales are associated with this effect however, and if smart motorway features may remove this effect from the data.",

In-particular, the authors considered roadnetworks in Huston, Medellin and Eastbourne and considered what features the data showed. They found statically significant evidence that events on the network did not follow a uniform spatial-temporal Poisson process and that tests indicated favoring clustering of data in space and time. However they focused on urban road networks, where as we focus on highways, in-particular smart motorways. As we consider one continuous ring-road, not an urban network, we can also use a standard distance measure, rather than a graph distance based one as in the cited work. Our choice of dataset is not to simplify the fitting procedure onto continuous space rather than a network, but instead it offers some insight into a much discussed topic of smart motorway safety.",

One application discussed in this review is earthquake modelling, as in Zhuang et al. (2004) , Zhuang (2011) and Kumazawa and Ogata (2014) . This is a natural application for such models, as there is strong evidence that initial large earthquakes lead to aftershocks, and hence there is a clearly interpretable 'self-excitation' component to the application. Another application discussed is crime forecasting, as in Mohler et al. (2011) and Mohler (2014) , where self-excitation can be seen in physical terms as retaliation crimes, among other things.",

There is much discussion as to what functional form the components should take, in-particular for the triggering components. Typically, one supposes some reasonable parametric forms, then determines which is most appropriate through inspection of the log-likelihood value or information criteria. Standard choices include some form of exponential, Gaussian or power-law decay of triggering in time and space. However, recent work in Zhuang and Mateu (2019) showed how one could determine both the background and triggering components in a non-parametric way, through kernel-smoothing of data. In-particular, the authors proposed to model crime data using a background comprised of periodic daily, periodic weekly, long-term trend and spatial components, as-well as triggering in space and time. However, every component is determined without assuming any functional form, instead the authors show how when basing their methods on work in Zhuang (2006) , one can determine which events in the data appear to be background and which appear to be triggered, and then smooth data based on this to reconstruct the desired components. It is on this we base most of our work in this paper, and in section 4 we give an overview of the methodology and how we adapt it for our use.",

However, only simulated data is used, generated from the proposed model, to then show how the fitting and evaluation would work. Additionally, a somewhat similar idea was considered in Lim et al. (2016) , however importantly here the authors considered traffic flow data to be 'events' and tried to use self-excitation to model the idea that often traffic flow occurs in clusters. They then applied the methods to model traffic flow in Sydney, however there was no clear conclusion as to if the model was statistically defensible and captured all features of the data, or if alternative traffic flow forecasting methods were preferable. There is still an enormous amount of work to be done applying this methodology to real-data, and understanding what components of it are important, and the amount of self excitation present in traffic data, along with appropriate time and length scales it occurs on.

Inside NTIS, roads are represented by a directed graph, with edges (referred to as links from now on) being segments of road that have a constant number of lanes and no slip roads joining or leaving. We extract all links that lie on the M25 in the clockwise direction, yielding a subset of the road network to collect data for.

We extract all accidents and obstructions that occurred on the chosen links between September 1st 2017 and September 30th 2018. However, we require more fine-grained location data for events than just the link it occurred on, so we perform further localization by inspecting adjacent loop sensors. To understand why this is needed, one should note that links vary in size from around 500 to 10,000 meters. As a result, the data is not initially appropriate to model with point-processes, however one can use the time-series provided by individual loop sensors positioned along links to determine higher resolution location data for events. The average distance between successive loop sensors is roughly 500 meters, vastly reducing location uncertainty on longer links.

In such a case, there should be very little impact on flow, travel time, speed and so on. Additionally, if a vehicle breaks down and pulls into the hard-shoulder, and the road is nowhere near capacity, we should again see little drop in speed or rise in occupancy.

If this percentage drop is above some threshold, then we say the event caused a significant impact on the traffic state. Further discussion of this simple seasonal segmentation model is given in the supplementary material. Of course, as we raise this threshold we isolate more extreme events but quickly discard so much data that it is no longer reasonable to fit a model. We find that using a threshold above 50% speed drop, we start to discard over 70% of the events data, so consider thresholds between 0 and 50% for analysis. We split our dataset into subsets containing only events that lead to a speed decrease of at-least 0%, 10%, . . . , 50%, then re-run our model fitting on these subsets. The resulting background components are visualized in Fig. 9 . Inspecting Fig. 9a , we see the daily background is reasonably stable across different thresholds of significance. The main difference is that as we require a more extreme speed drop, the morning and evening peak structure becomes more clear, and the periods very early in the morning and late in the day are lowered. From Fig. 9b , we observe that the weekend has a lower intensity than weekdays as we raise the threshold for significance. This is likely due to the fact that demand will be significantly lower on weekends compared to weekdays, and hence when an event does occur, there is less chance of an enormous queue forming simply due to the road being further from capacity than on a weekday. Finally, the spatial background in Fig. 9c clearly shows that the second peak, identified around 140 kilometers along the M25, appears to experience more significantly impactful events than the first peak, observed around 25 kilometers along the M25. This suggests that not only is Potters Bar a 'hot-spot' for events, but also that the events here are some of the more extreme on the network.",

This variation is found to be strongly inhomogeneous. The temporal variation shows a strong daily double peak structure reflecting commuting patterns superimposed in a weaker weekly variation with a peak on Fridays and a trough on Saturdays. This pattern of temporal variation remains stable over the data period. The spatial variation shows two primary peaks in intensity. The first and largest is in the vicinity of the Potters Bar Interchange. The other is in the vicinity of Junctions 5 and 6 where the M26 and M23 join the M25. The peak at Potters Bar appears to increase in intensity during the data period, and is more pronounced when we condition on the most significant events in terms of impact on traffic speed. We find that 6-7% of the observed incidents are most probably secondary incidents under the assumptions of our model. Plausible time and length scales emerge for the range of the triggering effects : 100 minutes in the temporal triggering, and 2 kilometres for spatial triggering. From these figures we conclude that the effects of secondary incidents is a small but detectable feature of the M25 incident data set. Our analysis suggests that, on the M25 at least, the scope to further reduce accident rates by reducing the number of secondary incidents is limited compared to what could be achieved by reducing the peaks at specific times or 'hot-spot' locations.",

We also believe it is important to further validate our methodology for spatial localisation of incidents, ideally against a dataset of true incident locations. One could also consider how to extend our out-of-sample validation methodology to other uses, for example including a simple model that would allow one to extrapolate the trend to allow for incorporation of this component.",

This is a far higher level of detail than initially provided by NTIS events, so we decide to refine our data further by using the time-series provided by the loop sensors. This is not a trivial task however as we do not have labeled data on which we can train a model, and instead must define sensible criteria that indicate the location of an incident.

Generally, we see in Fig. 7a that the daily background component is constant throughout the year, the only variation being in the 3-months of data starting on 03/2018, where the morning peak is a little more pronounced than any of the other datasets, and the evening is a little less. It is difficult to make conclusions about the weekly component, when we have only 12 instances of each day of the week for a given 3-month subset. Of particular interest is the spatial background through time, shown in Fig. 7c, where we see that the peak around 140 kilometers along the M25 actually becomes more pronounced as time progresses. Both the peak at 25 and 140 kilometers are present throughout all subsets of data, but later periods appear to show that the peak around Potters Bar is more significant later in the dataset compared to earlier. It is unclear from a practical perspective if a physical change occurred leading , but would be of interest to investigate with more data. Finally, the temporal and spatial triggering functions are generally quite consistent across all datasets. We still see somewhat of a long decay in the temporal triggering, but time-scales of around 100 minutes remain. Considering the triggering in each of these subsets, we attain\u00c2 values of 0.033, 0.069, 0.068 and 0.075 for the periods starting 2017/09, 2017/12, 2018/03 and 2018/06",
