One aspect of this cooperation has been the international community\u2019s increased use of, and reliance on, event-based information systems such as the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) and HealthMap. Whilst traditional indicator-based surveillance routinely report cases of disease, usually on a weekly or monthly basis, event-based surveillance aims to rapidly detect, report and assess public health events, including clusters of disease and rumours of unexplained deaths. Significantly, event-based systems make judgements about disease risk by monitoring often unverified media sources. Within the extensive literature on the event, this paper is informed by Anderson and Adey\u2019s observation that events may emerge unexpectedly and threaten to disrupt the \u2018complex interdependencies\u2019 that are associated with mobility in the modern world (2012: 27; Cabinet Office, Dillon, 2007, Barker, in press). These events may take the form of infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks, civil unrest and weather-related emergencies (Anderson and Adey, 2012). Crucially, they are located in specific places, detected by information systems, and communicated to other systems to form a network. As a consequence, these places assume a particular significance, as information about the event is broadcast to subscribers to these systems, including international institutions, such as the WHO.",

Yet, little consideration has been given to the operation of individual surveillance systems. Equally, within the domain of global governance, there has been a dearth of analysis into the ways in which the WHO and its member states use the 'informal' information supplied by these systems to make judgements about the spread and severity of global disease outbreaks. In this article, we place the activity of these systems within the context of the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 pandemic, considering how disease risk comes to be represented, and acted upon, across local, national and global scales of governance. Using Margaret Chan\u2019s call for \u2018new\u2019 international health diplomacy, we draw attention to the importance of places, often situated in countries of the global South, in providing the source material for specific global alerts, and we examine the subsequent responses by member states across the global North and South.",

Biosecurity operations are enacted within what Bingham et al. describe as a \u2018complex geography\u2019 where \u2018states and locales are increasingly asked to conform to what is regarded (in the metropolitan core) as a safe world\u2019 (2008: 1529). According to this perspective, it is the \u2018centralised expertise\u2019, often located in the countries of the global North, that press for \u2018globalising biosecurity practices\u2019 (Bingham et al., 2008: 1529), seeking \u2018maximal cooperation from all countries\u2019 (Ingram, 2009: 2). In leading this drive for cooperation, transnational institutions, such as the WHO, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the World Bank have been perceived as enacting measures that, arguably, focus unduly on \u2018problems\u2019 in the global South (Brown and Bell, 2008, King, 2002).",

These networks electronically monitor online news sources and, in the case of \u2018syndromic surveillance\u2019, non-diagnostic information (Fearnley, 2008: 1615)1\n.

It also highlighted the need for more advanced preparedness across national and global scales (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, Fearnley, 2008). Rather than tackling specific dangers, preparedness is concerned with \u2018generic capacities that will enable responses to a broad spectrum of contingencies\u2019 (Ingram, 2010: 296; Fearnley, 2008). At a national scale, preparedness planning has been guided by the framework documentation published by the WHO and adopted by its member states (WHO, 2009a). For example, the UK\u2019s Pandemic Flu: a national framework, published in 2007, detailed various interventions including the stockpiling of drugs, and the imposition of restrictions on internal travel and public gatherings (Cabinet Office and Department of Health (DH), 2007). When one focuses on this national scale, it is apparent that, notwithstanding the drive for global cooperation led by the WHO, practices vary widely between countries, implying that internationally-imposed frameworks for health security may be \u2018more precarious and prone to breakdown than we usually give credit\u2019 (Bingham and Hinchliffe, 2008: 190). The SARS outbreak demonstrated, nevertheless, that, through the influence of global surveillance networks and the information that they supplied, consistencies could be identified in the timing of the interventions by individual states. Building on Ingram (2010), we argue that these networks have come to play an important mediating role in the spaces between preparedness and response.",

According to Keller et al. (2009), almost all major disease epidemics investigated by the WHO over the last decade were first identified through these sources. The WHO claim these networks have proven to be particularly effective in detecting outbreaks among populations that \u2018do not access health care through formal channels\u2019 (2008a: 4). Consequently, biosecurity practices, notably alerts, have become ever more embedded in the work of global surveillance systems. Reports gathered by systems such as GPHIN, coupled with China\u2019s concealment of information during the early stages of the SARS outbreak, provided the impetus in 2005 for approval of the WHO\u2019s revised International Health Regulations (IHR). The IHR \u2013 which came into effect in June 2007 \u2013 gave the WHO a legal basis for greater intervention in the affairs of member states to enable, at least ostensibly, more effective global public health governance (WHO, 2008a). Whereas the previous IHR only named a list of notifiable diseases, the revised Regulations formed another part of the global health security apparatus, with coverage extended to all \u2018public health emergencies of international concern\u2019 (WHO, 2008a). Although Article 6 imposed 'obligations' member states to 'notify' WHO of 'all events' that may constitute such an emergency (WHO, 2008a: 1), Article 9 of the IHR permitted the WHO to take account of information from sources other than official notifications and consultations, allowing it legally to override any national government that tried to suppress data concerning communicable disease. Within the context of international openness, \u2018informal\u2019 information on isolated disease outbreaks occurring in various places was granted a new authority.",

Cooperation with the WHO was deemed, therefore, to be highly desirable. Thus, effective global public health governance, led by the WHO, requires high quality, yet \u2018informal\u2019, event-based information from surveillance networks, together with communications from member states, via both statutory mechanisms such as the NFPs and through less formal personal contacts. The operation of these interactions is examined through case study evidence.",

Singapore was one of many countries that deployed thermal scanners to screen air passengers on arrival, whilst Japan increased the use of pre-existing scanners at Narita International Airport (Reuters, 2009a). Moreover, and in direct contravention of WHO advice, measures were introduced aimed at restricting travel.

Other member states \u2013 such as the UK, Australia, France and Switzerland \u2013 advised against 'non-essential' travel to Mexico (Bone et al., 2009). These actions proved contentious.

Whilst this locational reporting could be used by certain countries to discriminate against selected others, arguably it also influenced the subsequent actions of the WHO which sought to harmonise and integrate national approaches to biosecurity (Bingham et al., 2008).

In the US, the CDC quickly reversed its position on imposing this sanction (Gostin, 2009), whilst in the UK the timing of such shutdowns generated local hostility (Warren et al., 2010).",

At the same time, China continued to quarantine travellers throughout summer 2009 in spite of international criticism (Metzl, 2009). According to Yanzhong (2010), memories of SARS and the high 'political and economic stakes' faced by Chinese politicians in the run-up to the 60th anniversary of the 'People's Republic of China', helped justify their 'aggressive' response to the H1N1 pandemic. Therefore, the financial and diplomatic costs (in terms of strained relations with Mexico, Canada and, potentially, the WHO) were, for Chinese government leaders, 'secondary' to the projection to their population of an image of 'a caring government fully in charge' (Yanzhong, 2010).

In enabling the rapid retrieval of 'informal' information across a range of localities, data collected through these mechanisms has been used by the WHO and its member states to anticipate threats which, to use Ingram's phrase, 'do not yet exist' (2010: 296). In the process, the surveillance systems act as intermediaries, facilitating a local-global dialogue. The technologies are largely deployed and developed by organisations in the global North, yet their success is dependent on the reporting of events in places across the global North and South. Moreover, decisions made by these systems to issue alerts are, in the main, dependant on uncovering largely 'informal' information broadcast through local press reports, news wires and online sources such as discussion sites (Grein et al., 2000). In the case of H1N1, our research has demonstrated that, through a process of \u2018verification\u2019, this information became \u2018formalised\u2019 and established a basis for issuing global alerts. Thus, implicit in this local-global interaction, was detailed analysis derived from information in the public domain, on what was said rather than what was left unsaid. Undoubtedly, there will be selectivity in the reporting process and a partiality in the information derived.",

Arguably, this enhanced the scope of the WHO to issue global public health alerts without necessarily requiring national verification and to secure member state cooperation in global pandemic preparedness.

In our case study, it was clear that the WHO could acquire information from a number of surveillance systems. Furthermore, although it could act without member state cooperation, the WHO publicly praised the Mexican government for demonstrating 'responsibility and transparency' in responding to its enquiries and in sharing its virus samples with WHO Collaborating Centres (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Daily Telegraph, Harris, 2009). Cooperation did exist between the WHO and selected member states over verification of this public health emergency. However, the joint working was complex. It involved anticipation of \u2013 and preparedness for \u2013 an event (an influenza pandemic) that had not yet been detected in some countries. Moreover, for the WHO, the imperative to establish a bridge between preparedness, and response, arguably shaped its interpretation of the information it received from event-based systems. Significantly, during the onset of the H1N1 pandemic, there followed widespread debate in academic and policy circles over what should be a proportionate response (Brown, 2009).",

For example, in East and South East Asia, several countries not only imposed trade embargos, passenger health checks prior to disembarkation and thermal image scanning at major airports, but also implemented varying degrees of quarantine (China, Hong Kong and Singapore) and, in at least one instance, maintained a database of foreign visitors (Thailand) (Budd et al., 2010). These measures proved in the main to be of limited use. Although China credited its \u2018stringent\u2019 quarantine practices with postponing community-level transmission of the virus, their duration was criticised (Metzl, 2009). Moreover, little evidence supported the use of thermal image screening to calculate passenger temperature as a means of identifying travellers suffering from fever (Nuzzo, 2009). In addition, in order to \u2018secure\u2019 their borders, a number of countries explicitly acted against global guidance. For example, legally contentious pork embargos were imposed \u2013 initially against Mexico and parts of the US and Canada \u2013 by 20 countries including Russia, China, Philippines and Indonesia (Gostin, 2009).

Whilst the IHR (2005) provided the WHO with a legal basis for requesting the withdrawal of these unilateral measures, there is no indication that the WHO exercised this redress during the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 influenza pandemic. If global health security is indeed a projection of the \u2018neocolonial\u2019 global North interests as Weir and Mykhalovskiy, 2006, Weir and Mykhalovskiy, 2010 argue, then it is being undermined by selected member states in the global South. Equally, global governance is being challenged by a range of countries across both hemispheres. Thus, whilst Braun argues \u2018biological existence\u2019 in the global South is ever more subject to biosecurity projects that \u2018seek to pre-empt risk through new forms of sovereign power\u2019, we contend that there is scope for autonomy, and independent biosecurity practices by individual countries, within what some critics may perceive as a new manifestation of \u2018empire\u2019 (2007: 25). Granted, the consequences of this autonomy have not been overlooked. Indeed, the WHO Review suggested that the 'impact' of the unilateral border measures adopted by member states be assessed, with a view to producing tighter 'guidance for future events' (WHO, 2011: 14).",

The space between preparedness for, and responses to, global infectious diseases is occupied by \u2018informal\u2019 information gathered by surveillance networks on real-time events. Technologies deployed by systems such as GPHIN are fundamental in identifying, and drawing global attention to, an \u2018event\u2019, situated in particular localities, bypassing national borders in the process. As a consequence of this technological openness, particular locations occupy important positions in the reporting process, and WHO member states are no longer able to withhold information on an 'event' that is in the public domain. National autonomy is reasserted, nevertheless, through the control actions deployed. Moreover, as the experience of Mexico demonstrated, whilst surveillance systems ascribe a new status to the locality, in practice particular places, including entire countries, can be stigmatised through negative representations in the media and the deployment of punitive national health security measures.",

Rather than global health security representing a projection of global North interests, space remained for the exercise of national sovereignty and control. In this supposedly new era of international health diplomacy, the drive for global health governance has prompted a complex range of technological interactions, diplomatic engagements and biosecurity practices across local, national and global scales.",
