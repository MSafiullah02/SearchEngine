IL-1 receptor activated kinases (IRAKs) play crucial roles as mediators in the TLR/IL-1R signal transduction pathways [2]. Moreover, IRAK family member IRAK1 has been identified as a key component of the IL-1R signaling pathway in mammals [3]. Upon ligand binding to TLR/IL-1R, IRAK1 is recruited to the receptor complex to initiate the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, leading to induction of inflammatory target genes such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-12 [4]. Furthermore, IRAK1 is involved in activation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), STAT1 and IRF7 (interferon regulation factor 7), as well as in downstream gene expression [2], [5], [6]. Phosphorylated IRAK1 also undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation or sumoylation resulting in nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of inflammatory target genes [7]. However, little is known about IRAK family member functions in fish, with the exception of zebrafish [8], [9].",

In the last decade, the spread of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) has resulted in significant economic loss for many fish farms [10], [11]. ISKNV is classified in the Megalocystivirus genus of the Iridoviridae family. Thirteen cultured fish species and 39 wild fish species have been confirmed to be hosts of ISKNV-like viruses [12], including the mandarin fish. Infected fish develop serious systemic diseases [13], and ISKNV infection is capable of causing severe epizootics resulting in mass mortalities. Therefore, it is important to study the pathology and immunity of the mandarin fish in order to search for effective ways to protect the fish from diseases. In the present study, we cloned an IRAK1 cDNA from the mandarin fish (named ScIRAK1), and showed that after ISKNV infection, the ScIRAK1 mRNA level was significantly higher in fish with typical disease symptoms than in fish without symptoms or control fish injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Furthermore, overexpression of ScIRAK1 in the 293T cells could induce NF-\u03baB activation. These results suggest that ScIRAK1 may play a role in the pathology of ISKNV infection in the mandarin fish.",

At 15 days post-infection, some fish recovered from the virus infection, and the expression of ScIRAK1 transcript in the blood cells was slightly lower (\u223c0.71-fold) than in control fish, while expression of ScIRAK1 mRNA did not significantly change in the PBS-injected control fish.

Upon ligand binding to TLR/IL-1R, IRAK1 binds to MyD88, which interacts with the receptor. IRAK1 is subsequently phosphorylated and activated by IRAK4. Hyperphosphorylated IRAK1 then leaves the receptor complex and forms a cytosolic IRAK1-TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) complex, resulting in eventual activation of the downstream pathways [2]. Phosphorylation of IRAK1 is a hallmark of IRAK activation. In humans, Thr-209 and Thr-387 in IRAK1 are phosphorylated [18]. These two threonine residues are conserved in ScIRAK1 (Thr-193 and Thr-373, Fig. 1). Therefore, we speculate that ScIRAK1 may be phosphorylated during TLR activation.",

Documented examples of this phenomenon include the following: infection with the West Nile Virus (WNV) leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier, which facilitates entry of the virus into the brain [22]; reinfection with dengue virus results in dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which has been linked to a cytokine storm, ultimately causing an increase in vascular permeability [23]; and infections with viruses such as poxvirus [21], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [24], [25], [26] and influenza virus [27] result in tissue damages as a result of a cytokine storm. IRAK1 has been reported to play important roles in tissue injury related to a cytokine storm. For example, IRAK1 was shown to be a central kinase involved in acute LPS-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction and septic shock [28], [29]. In this study, at the 7th day after ISKNV infection, most infected fish showed typical symptoms, and quantitative RT-PCR showed that the ScIRAK1 mRNA level was significantly higher in the diseased fish than in the fish without symptoms. Further work showed that ScIRAK1 could induce NF-\u03baB activation. Thus, it is possible that upregulation of ScIRAK1 in the mandarin fish after ISKNV infection may activate NF-\u03baB, resulting in a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d and subsequent tissue damage, which is related to disease progression and pathology.",

The expression level of ScIRAK1 mRNA in the spleen was used as the calibrator (set as 1). (B) Quantitative PCR analysis of ScIRAK1 mRNA expression in the blood cells after ISKNV or PBS injection. The expression level of ScIRAK1 mRNA in healthy blood cells (day 0) was used as the calibrator (set as 1). 7S indicates the fish with apparent symptoms 7 days after virus infection; 7NS indicates the fish without any symptoms 7 days after virus infection. \u201c15\u201d indicates the fish that recovered from the virus infection without any symptoms 15 days after virus infection.
