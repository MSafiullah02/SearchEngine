In collaboration with the Pennsylvania HIV Planning Group (HPG) we developed an intersectional stigma measure to examine experiences of stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings among individuals living with HIV (PLWH). This survey is ongoing and aims to assess the prevalence of multidimensional stigma in healthcare settings, characterize intersectional stigma burden, and evaluate the impact of stigma on health among a sample of individuals living with HIV in Pennsylvania who are recipients of the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. In this Note from the Field, we describe the unprompted COVID-related responses we have received since March 4, 2020 until the writing of this Note (April 14, 2020). These responses present an important opportunity to begin to learn about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of people living with HIV and their beliefs and attitudes about their healthcare needs and experiences.",

Of the 16 participants, 94% identified as male; 94% identified as White; and 75% identified as gay. The age of participants ranged from 29 to 72, with a mean age of 58.7.

Also, I am on salvage therapy and my options to treatments are fewer and my hearing bad news becomes more. I feel like a deer facing headlights.\nParticipants expressed fears of how the COVID-19 pandemic will disrupt HIV care services, like the loss of, or restricted access to healthcare services and HIV funding. In addition, the impacts of the current social distancing mandates on mental health and wellbeing is concerning: \u201cGetting by this corona virus period of virtual isolation. Normally, I go the gym twice daily and eat out an awful lot. I, like all, am concerned about how long this situation will continue.\u201d",

These unprompted responses covered several domains of concern including avoidance of healthcare services due to nosocomial risk of COVID infection, social isolation, change in routine, potential mortality, continued access to healthcare services, and management of comorbidities, specifically cancer.

PLWH are navigating their HIV and related healthcare needs in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to navigating COVID-19 prevention and care while living with HIV. Living with a stigmatized chronic infectious disease in the times of a pandemic presents a myriad of challenges. This is particularly true in communities of color and SGM communities who experience systemic social and health inequities [5, 6]. Gross disparities in our society around race, sexual, gender identities, employment, health, and education lead many populations to experience discrimination, unwelcome attitudes, and lack of understanding from healthcare staff [4]. COVID-19 is exacerbating these inequities in terms of housing stability, employment status, healthcare access, and food security. This is further demonstrated in a recent analysis published by the CDC that shows African American are disproportionately in need of COVID-related hospital care [6].",

As PLWH self-isolate to prevent COVID-19, we need to recognize that enforced social isolation in populations who already report stigma, alienation and discrimination may exacerbate underlying psychosocial health conditions. Studies have shown that people living with HIV are already more likely to experience loneliness due to a history of stigma and discrimination, with studies also indicating that higher levels of loneliness and social isolation result in greater negative health outcomes, including a higher likelihood of smoking, at-risk drinking or substance use, higher rates or depression, and lower quality of life [7]. We need work to understand the effects of social isolation on individuals living with HIV, how they are seeking support and how they want to be supported. It is now even more important to work on short-term interventions to increase social connectedness during these times of isolation.",
