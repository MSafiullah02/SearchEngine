Although it seems that children with diabetes have not shown a different disease pattern compared with their non-diabetic counterparts, clinicians caring for diabetic children should not become complacent, particularly in these early days when new evidence is still emerging. We continue to recommend a cautious approach in the management strategies for children with diabetes, as individuals with underlying diabetes are at increased risk of severe pulmonary infections, and diabetes was found to be a risk factor for mortality in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).2\n",

In addition, the general recommendations for infection prevention cannot be emphasized enough during this pandemic. All diabetic patients should receive pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations and be specifically reminded about the importance of good hand hygiene, avoiding touching their faces, and observing appropriate social distancing to reduce risk of infection. We echo the specific recommendations outlined by Gupta et al for diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.3 Specifically, those with type 1 diabetes should adhere to standard \u201csick day\u201d guidelines with increased frequency of monitoring of blood glucose and ketones. In addition, frequent changes in dosage and correction in insulin boluses may be required to maintain normoglycemia. In ill patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage of oral anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin need to be adjusted to reduce the risk of lactic acidosis.",

Although there is some suggestion that ACE-inhibitors may increase the severity of COVID-19, reports are conflicting suggesting both increased ACE level may be a poor prognostic factor for severe pneumonia and that use of ACE-inhibiting agents reduce the severity of pulmonary inflammation.4 The evidence has not been sufficient to change the practice for patients with diabetes thus far, but the endocrine community should remain vigilant for new evidence and guidance as more information on this issue emerges. On a similar note, there is some suggestion that ibuprofen may increase expression of ACE-2 receptor, potentially increasing binding of the virus to target cells and potentiating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.5 Although this theoretical concern requires further substantiation, the advice from the WHO is to use paracetamol over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of fever associated with COVID-19 which is prudent. 5\n",

Moreover, parents of children with suboptimal diabetic control who require closer follow up may postpone their appointments due to fear and anxiety. Where available, these patients should be offered the option of remote teleconsultation with their doctors to review their glycemic control and insulin titration, especially for young children. With many countries instituting policies to mandate home quarantine, clinicians also should be mindful of the potential of changes in dietary habits and available food choices as well as reduction in physical activity, which impact glycemic control.",

Amidst this COVID-19 crisis, endocrinologists can exploit these systems and devices to provide remote care to their patients with diabetes. The use of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) is now the standard of care in many centers worldwide. Closed-loop CGMS systems that incorporate the use of automated decision support systems between insulin pumps and CGMS provide an added benefit, which is that insulin titration can be achieved accurately with good comparability to endocrinologist-decision making.6 This can reduce the need for intensive physician monitoring.6 Home testing of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) will be welcomed by diabetics and their endocrinologists in the face of the COVID-19 crisis. Possibilities exist for home HbA1c testing in which patients need only perform finger-prick sampling similar to a standard blood glucose monitoring procedure. HbA1c readings from finger-prick samples have been shown to agree favorably with gold standard assays using venepuncture samples.7 Collected samples can be submitted via postal mail and assay has been shown to remain accurate up to 4 days post-collection, a feature that can be exploited during a pandemic such as this.7 In addition, state-of-the-art technology for screening complications, such as the hand-held non-mydriatic portable fundus camera linked to a smartphone, has been shown to be reliable for diabetic retinopathy screening.8 \u201cUse of such technology potentially could reduce in person visits for ophthalmologic care and can be implemented easily and with reasonable reliability at least for use during this pandemic. These remote consulting and prescribing services should be made possible through the establishment of telehealth consultation systems. Importantly, although these services should keep patients safe and lighten the ambulatory aspect of diabetes care, families must be made aware they do not replace emergency care, especially if the child is unwell, in which case, a visit to the nearest acute care center would be strongly advised.",
