            "text": "Ten years ago, interferon (IFN)-\u03bb was discovered by two independent groups [1, 2]. IFN-\u03bb forms the type III IFN family, which is composed of three members, IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3, also named IL-29, IL-28A and IL-28B, respectively [1, 2]. Recently, a fourth IFN-\u03bb subtype, named IFN-\u03bb4, has been described in humans [3]. It is expressed in a small fraction of the human population as a consequence of a frameshift occurring in a coding sequence, upstream of the IFNL3 gene. This IFN only bears 29% identity with IFN-\u03bb3 but acts through the same receptor and displays typical antiviral activity [4].",

Type I IFNs use a different receptor (IFNAR), which is composed of subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c. However, upon binding their cognate receptors, type I and type III IFNs trigger the same Jak-STAT signal transduction pathway [5, 8, 9] (fig. 1), leading to the upregulation of many genes, called IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [reviewed in [10]]. More than 300 ISGs have been identified. Their products act to control viral infection, to modulate immune responses or to control mitosis. In addition, some ISGs encode factors that participate in the IFN signal transduction pathway and, therefore, control IFN expression and response through positive or negative feedback loops (fig. 1).",

Next, analysis of IFN-\u03bb antiviral activity in vivo largely benefited from the development of IFN-\u03bb receptor-deficient mice (IFNLR10/0) [12]. By comparing viral infection in wild-type, IFNLR10/0, IFNAR0/0 and double-knockout mice, it was shown that the contribution of IFN-\u03bb to the control of viral infection greatly varied according to the virus [13].

Additional studies showed no protective effect of IFN-\u03bb against infection with encephalomyocarditis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus [8, 12]. Similarly, no antiviral activity of IFN-\u03bb could be detected in mice against hepatotropic viruses such as Rift Valley fever virus, Lassa fever virus or a mutant strain of Thogoto virus (THOV) lacking the IFN-antagonist ML protein (\u0394ML) [14, 15]. The lack of IFN-\u03bb antiviral activity against these viruses was not due to a lack of IFN-\u03bb expression in infected organs since IFN-\u03bb was transcriptionally active in the liver of mice infected with THOV-\u0394ML [14]. Yet, in spite of IFN-\u03bb expression, THOV and Rift Valley fever virus failed to induce Mx1 expression in infected livers of Mx+/+ mice lacking functional type I IFN receptors (IFNAR0/0) [14].",

Additional studies carried out with influenza virus showed variable extents of protection mediated by IFN-\u03bb: two studies reported that IFN-\u03bb was of moderate importance against influenza virus (strains SC35M, PR8-\u0394NS1, A/HH/05/2009 and B/Lee/ 40) [14, 15] and one study observed a major role for IFN-\u03bb (strain A/HK-X31) [16].

Indeed, control of respiratory syncytial virus infection depended equally on the presence of type I and type III IFN receptors. Interestingly, IFN-\u03bb was shown to play a major, nonredundant, role in the protection against rotavirus infection [17]. IL-28R\u03b10/0, and double-knockout mice were highly susceptible to oral rotavirus infection, while IFNAR0/0 and wild-type mice were resistant. Moreover, administration of IFN-\u03bb allowed the control of rotavirus infection in mice, while administration of IFN-\u03b1 did not. IFN-\u03bb thus appears to contribute much more than type I IFNs to the protection against rotavirus [17].",

            "text": "Several studies examined the responsiveness of human and mouse cell lines and primary cells to IFN-\u03bb (table 2). Unsurprisingly, IFN-\u03bb responses correlated with IL-28R\u03b1 expression [11]. Fibroblasts, splenocytes, bone-marrow-derived macrophages and endothelial cells did not respond to IFN-\u03bb, although they responded to IFN-\u03b1. In contrast, mouse melanoma cells and keratinocytes responded to IFN-\u03bb [5]. Further studies demonstrated that epithelial cells are the primary targets of type III IFNs. Analysis of IFNLR1 expression in isolated mouse cells revealed that keratinocytes and vaginal epithelial cells, but not fibroblasts, were responsive to IFN-\u03bb [12]. The first in vivo study of IFNLR1 expression in mice was performed in our laboratory [19]. In this study, the response to circulating IFN-\u03bb was evaluated in vivo in various mouse organs after plasmid-mediated expression of IFN-\u03bb from tibialis muscle cells. The tissues that showed the highest IFN-\u03bb responsiveness - stomach, intestine, skin and lung - were epithelium-rich organs. Moreover, the response to IFN-\u03bb paralleled IFNLR1 expression in analyzed tissues. In this study, the IFN-\u03bb response was analyzed at the cellular level in kidney and brain sections using immunohistofluorescent detection of Mx1, a specific marker of the IFN response. IFN-\u03bb-responsive cells strikingly differed from IFN-\u03b1-responsive cells. After IFN-\u03bb expression, Mx1-positive cells almost exclusively corresponded to epithelial cells. These included cells forming the convoluted tubules in the kidney and the epithelial cells of the choro\u00efd plexus in the brain. In contrast to IFN-\u03bb, circulating IFN-\u03b1 induced a widespread response, which was pronounced in endothelial cells and included most cell types. The epithelial cell specificity of IFN-\u03bb responses was subsequently observed in many other organs, such as the lung, intestine, stomach, skin or liver [15, 17, 19, 20] (fig. 3). In humans, constitutive expression of IFNLR1 was also observed in the upper epidermis [21].",

Likewise, IFN-\u03bb treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or pDCs in coculture with HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells enhanced the production of IFN-\u03b1 [23]. In contrast, two studies failed to show activation of the type I IFN pathway by IFN-\u03bb: after infection with Sendai virus, splenocytes derived from IFNLR10/0 mice did not produce less type I or type III IFN than splenocytes derived from wild-type mice [12]; also, IFN-\u03bb treatment of human airway epithelial cells infected with influenza A did not increase IFN-\u03b2 expression [34].

Side effects, such as aminotransferase, lipase or amylase elevation, were reported. Other adverse events, including fatigue, nausea, myalgia or headache, were reported but seemed to be less frequent than after IFN-\u03b1 therapy.

These SNPs, rs12979860 and rs8099917, are located \u223c3 and \u223c8 kb upstream of IFNL3, respectively [56, 57, 58], and are associated with response of HCV patients to cotreatment with pegIFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin, and with spontaneous HCV clearance [56, 57, 58, 59, 60]. The rs12979860[T] allele is associated with treatment failure in patients of European ancestry, while the C allele is associated with a twofold greater rate of sustained virological response [56]. Interestingly, Ge et al. [56] identified two additional SNPs in the IFNL3 gene (SNPs rs28416813 and rs8103142) that are highly associated with rs12979860. rs28416813 consists of a G\u2192C substitution 37 bp upstream of the IFNL3 start codon, and rs8103142, which occurs in the IFN-\u03bb open reading frame and results in a nonsynonymous amino acid change at position 70, where arginine is substituted for lysine (K70R). Since then, other SNPs have been identified in the region of the IFNL3 gene and associated with sustained virological response to pegIFN-\u03b1/ribavirin therapy. However, the mechanism by which IFN-\u03bb3 polymorphisms affect the efficacy of HCV clearance remains to be determined.",

Importantly, in vivo, the expression pattern of the IFN-\u03bb receptor clearly diverges from that of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor. The IFN-\u03bb response is predominantly observed in epithelial cells, although some hematopoietic cells were also shown to be responsive. IFN-\u03bb thus likely evolved to protect mucosal surfaces against viral infection. This IFN family is probably of utter importance against viruses with a strong epithelial tropism, as was demonstrated in the case of rotavirus [17]. It is worth noting that recent studies show that epithelial cells also act as IFN-\u03bb-producing cells. The IFN-\u03bb system thus likely evolved to offer a local protection that fits epithelium-rich anatomical structures, such as the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract (fig. 4). Protection of epithelial surfaces may also be instrumental in limiting virus transmission by feco-oral or aerosol transmission by reducing both virus excretion and virus entry.",

Viral nucleic acids are recognized by transmembrane TLRs, cytoplasmic DNA sensors and RNA helicases, leading to the activation of kinases. These kinases promote the activation of the NF-\u03baB, IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors and their subsequent translocation to the nucleus where they stimulate IFN gene transcription. IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03b2 gene expression largely depends on IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. Expression of IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3, like that of IFN-\u03b1, depends more on IRF7 availability. Type I IFNs use a dimeric receptor composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c. Type III IFNs signal through a different receptor, which is composed of IFNLR1 and IL10RB. Upon binding to their cognate receptors, type I and type III IFNs induce the same Jak/STAT pathway: the transphosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated Jak1 and Tyk2 leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 transcription factors. Phosphorylated forms of STAT1 and STAT2 further associate with IRF9 to form a heterotrimeric ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. ISGF3 then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to sequences of IFN-stimulated response elements present in the promoter of ISGs to upregulate their transcription. Some ISG products participate themselves in the signaling pathways leading to IFN production and IFN responses thus creating positive (and negative) feedback loops.

By acting on most cells, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 would act in a rather radial way from the infection focus.",
