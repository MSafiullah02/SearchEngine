It has been demonstrated that some microorganisms codify several ABC transporters [18]. E. coli is known to contain more than one active transport system for nucleoside uptake [19]. Therefore, a differential biotransformation capability could be related to the ability of microorganisms to differentially internalize nucleoside analogues with modifications in their natural structure.

Even though higher amounts of biocatalysts (5 \u00d7 1010\n CFU) also showed good yields (Fig. 1\n), such reaction condition was not selected for subsequent assays due to the reaction reversion observed after 6 h as well as the operational difficulties that have already been discussed in similar biocatalytic systems [20].

When microorganisms in stationary phase (12\u201324 h) were assayed, reaction yields were around 70%.

The statistical data analysis by the Duncan test demonstrated that the best condition was 6 h of culture, while between 12 and 16 h no significant changes were observed (Fig. 3\n).

The retardation factor (Rf) of ribavirin is close to 0.5 and different from that of the substrates, such as Urd, used in the bioprocess, allowing to recover the silica gel fraction with the product of interest. Therefore, the natural nucleoside was loaded in contiguous line to the obtained ribavirin as reference. This purification technique allows to obtain 21 mg of purified ribavirin without the presence of substrates or secondary products (see supplementary data).",
