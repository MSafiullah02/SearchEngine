This probe is then added directly to a clinical sample, either a fluid or tissue section. Multiple probes, with different fluorescent tags, can be added to a single sample, allowing for the detection of several organisms in a single assay. This technique of hybridization of a probe to a target sequence in an organism was one of the first applied techniques in human clinical medicine but has not gained widespread use in feline medicine. This technique is still used routinely to monitor the viral load in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus undergoing antiviral therapy. The feline therapeutic correlate, treatment of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), has not advanced to as finely tuned a protocol. Probe hybridization is rapid, user friendly, and simple to perform. This technique also removes the need for specialized culture conditions, but sensitivity of this technique is poor compared with other molecular techniques. Prior enrichment of the sample via microbiological culture improves sensitivity but increases the time needed for the assay and requires knowledge of the microbiological cultural demands of the organisms, eliminating many of the advantages of the technique for clinical application. This technique remains useful for the detection of slow-growing organisms, such as fungi and mycobacteria, in the presence of other more rapidly growing organisms in culture and for the rapid quantification of the organism load in a nonenriched clinical sample.",

This technique uses the same theory as the simple probe hybridization but applies it to tissue samples, allowing the detection of the organisms of interest in association with inflammatory lesions or specific areas of tissue. This technique is useful in situations in which a large number of organisms can be detected, but the organisms may be part of a normal flora, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract. In situ hybridization allows the user to determine if certain bacterial species are associated with inflammation or are beyond the superficial layers of the gastrointestinal tract. Fluorescent molecules are the most common signaling mechanism used, and in this case, the method is abbreviated FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization). The technology is as simple as a solution-based probe hybridization but requires skilled operators because nonspecific background staining can cause false-positive results.",

            "text": "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was first described in 19851 by Kary Mullis and colleagues, for which Mullis later received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This powerful tool uses the cyclic amplification of a strand of DNA using a proprietary enzyme to produce an exponential number of identical copies to a detectable level (Fig. 1\nA). The DNA is then analyzed, usually on a gel, to determine if it is of the predicted size for the reaction (see Fig. 1B). Application of this technique allows for the detection of minute numbers of organisms in a very small sample, an advantage in feline medicine given the size of patients. PCR is superior to probe hybridization techniques in sensitivity because of this amplification. Although the exponential amplification of the original target provides the greatest advantage of this technique, it is also the basis of the greatest downfall, contamination. Initially, PCR was restricted to highly specialized research and diagnostic laboratories. Commercially available kit-based technology now allows for more widespread use of PCR. This technology has decreased cost and improved availability but increases concerns regarding quality control. Strict adherence to good laboratory practice must be observed for credible results. This criterion raises a problem for clinicians because they cannot be aware of the actual laboratory practices of the laboratory supplying the assay. Therefore, it is recommended that if a recently published PCR assay is to be used clinically, the originating laboratory be used if at all possible because the laboratory personnel are familiar with the nuances of the individual assay and have experience with the largest number of clinical samples.",

If multiple targets can be detected in a single assay, the technique is termed a multiplex assay. It is clearly most advantageous to investigate the presence of multiple organisms in a single assay. However, in the PCR assay, each target sequence competes with each other for the common building blocks that allow the reaction to proceed: the enzyme, nucleotide, and various buffers and ions. Therefore, multiplex reactions are frequently less sensitive than singleplex assays and require extensive optimization to be useful.",

Subsequent analysis of the PCR product may then be used to identify the infecting organism much more rapidly than traditional microbiological techniques and may be more sensitive for the detection of fastidious organisms. However, antimicrobial sensitivity is not available while using this technique; therefore, PCR is complementary to traditional culture techniques. However, the use of PCR for the detection of certain genes that encode for antimicrobial resistance is also starting to gain clinical use and may provide additional rapid information before antimicrobial sensitivity results are being available.4\n",

            "text": "The most recent application of PCR in clinical feline medicine has been real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Quantification by traditional endpoint PCR is difficult because after so many amplification cycles, most samples yield essentially the same amount of product because some limiting reagent would have been completely consumed before the final amplification cycles. In 1992, Higuchi and colleagues5 reported a technique for monitoring the production of DNA during each amplification cycle so that the original quantity could be extrapolated by the identification of the logarithmic amplification phase of each individual reaction. This technique uses fluorescent dyes or probes that produce a signal after formation of the product (Fig. 2\n). During each amplification cycle, a detector records the amount of fluorescence in the sample. Gene expression is commonly measured using qPCR and has been used in many disease states in felines to evaluate host response to an infection.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Pathogen detection and load determination are some of the many applications of this technology. This assay has all the advantages of traditional endpoint PCR (sensitivity, specificity), offers a more rapid result, and has the ability to quantitate microbial DNA or RNA load. However, with these improvements additional concerns regarding quality control have been added. The fluorescent dyes and probes used to detect the PCR product allows for even more sensitive assays and susceptibility to contamination leading to false-positive results. Accuracy of quantitation is reliant on the availability of a reproducible high-quality standard curve. In an attempt to regulate this rapidly expanding field, minimum laboratory standards have been proposed.13 Although these guidelines can be used to evaluate the quality of a published protocol, many diagnostic laboratories use proprietary reactions that are not subject to peer review. But because of this practice, the practitioner needs to request the evaluation data from the diagnostic laboratory to evaluate the clinical utility of the assay until it has been evaluated in a peer-reviewed journal.",

PCR assays are also available for the detection of DNA of Tritrichomonas foetus, Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp, Clostridium spp, parvoviruses, and T gondii, and RT-PCR assay is available for coronaviruses. Trophozoites of T foetus can often be detected on wet-mount examination of fresh feces, which can be completed as an in-clinic test. The DNA of T foetus can be detected in healthy carrier cats, and so positive test results do not always prove illness from the organism.20 In cases with suspected salmonellosis or campylobacteriosis, assessment should be done by culture rather than by PCR to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. In dogs, the PPV of Clostridium spp PCR assays on feces is low, and if the assay is used, it should be combined with enterotoxin assays. Information in cats is currently lacking. At present, there is noevidence that parvovirus PCR assays on feces is superior to currently available antigen assays and that currently used PCR assays for panleukopenia virus amplify vaccine strains. Oocysts of T gondii are shed only for about 7 to 10 days, and millions of oocysts are generally shed during this period, making the organism very easy to identify. Thus, PCR assays are usually not needed to diagnose this infection. Because virus isolation is not clinically practical, RT-PCR is used most frequently to detect coronavirus RNA in feces. However, positive test results do not differentiate feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-inducing strains from enteric coronaviruses.",

In at least 2 studies of experimentally infected cats, Mhf was found to be apparently more pathogenic than Mhm. It seems that Mtc has intermediate pathogenicity. Diagnosis is based on demonstration of the organism on the surface of erythrocytes on examination of a thin blood film or PCR assay. The number of organisms fluctuates, and so blood film examination results can be false negative up to 50% of the time. It may be difficult to find the agent cytologically, particularly in the chronic phase. Thus, PCR assays are the tests of choice because of their sensitivity.21 Primers that can amplify the DNA of all the 3 hemoplasmas are available. qPCR assays can be used to monitor copy numbers during and after treatment but do not have greater sensitivity, specificity, or predictive value than conventional PCR assays.22 PCR assays should be considered in the evaluation of cats with unexplained fever or anemia and that are cytologically negative for the hemoplasmas. In addition, the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine recommends screening cats for hemoplasmas by PCR assays for their use as blood donors.23 Many cats are carriers of the relatively nonpathogenic Candidatus Mhm, and so positive test results may not always correlate to the presence of the disease (poor PPV).",

Thus, although the clinical syndromes can be similar, there is neither a single serologic test to document infection nor a standardized serology for cats.

Cats that are culture negative or PCR negative and antibody negative and cats that are culture negative or PCR negative and antibody positive are probably not a source of flea, cat, or human infection. However, bacteremia can be intermittent and false-negative culture or PCR results can occur, limiting the predictive value of a single battery of tests. Although serologic testing can be used to determine whether an individual cat has been exposed, both seropositive and seronegative cats can be bacteremic, limiting the diagnostic utility of serologic testing. Thus, testing healthy cats for Bartonella spp infection is not recommended at present.28 Testing should be reserved for cats with suspected clinical bartonellosis. Because Bartonella spp infection is so common in healthy cats, even culture- or PCR-positive results do not prove clinical bartonellosis. For example, although DNA of Bartonella spp was detected in more number of cats with fever than in pair-matched cats without fever, the test results in healthy cats were still commonly positive.29 A combination of serology and PCR is a rational approach to the evaluation of cats with suspected bartonellosis.",
