            "text": "The initial experimental attempts at lung transplantation date back over a century ago when Guthrie and Carrel implanted the heart and lungs of a kitten into the neck vessels of an adult cat [1]. Forty years later, the Russian physiologist Demikhov developed canine models of combined heart\u2013lung and single transplantation [2, 3]. In the early 1960s, Hardy and colleagues at the University of Mississippi performed the first human lung transplant in 1963 in a 58-year old man with advanced lung cancer. He survived 18 days, but succumbed to renal failure; no acute cellular rejection ( ACR) was found at postmortem examination [4]. The first Canadian lung transplant was performed in 1966. The recipient was a 31-year old man with advanced silicosis and he survived only 7 days. At postmortem, the transplanted lung showed ACR, preservation injury, and necrosis of the proximal bronchus [5]. In 1968, Cooley attempted the first human combined heart\u2013lung transplant on a 2-month old child with complex congenital heart disease, but she died 14 h later from respiratory failure [6]. Shortly thereafter, Lillehi and colleagues performed the procedure in an adult recipient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) and cor pulmonale with survival of only 8 days. Attempts at lung transplantation sputtered over the next decade with many centers abandoning their programs on account of dismal survival results attributable to insufficient immunosuppression and/or technical difficulties such as anastomotic dehiscence [7]. With the initiation of the cyclosporine era in 1980, there was resurgence in interest in combined heart\u2013lung transplantation by the Stanford team and lung transplantation in the Toronto program. This novel form of immunosuppression permitted reduced corticosteroid dosages and led to a reduction in anastomotic complications. Reitz et al. at Stanford [8] overcame a series of technical and immunosuppressive liabilities utilizing a non-human primate model before achieving successful long-term survival in their clinical program. Four of the five patients transplanted for advanced pulmonary vascular disease (either idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ( IPAH) or complex congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger\u2019s physiology) survived beyond a 6-month period of follow-up. Shortly thereafter, Patterson and Cooper [9] at the University of Toronto reported the first successful single lung transplant program for patients with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. The technique for double lung transplant evolved from the en bloc approach with tracheal anastomosis to the current bilateral sequential single lung transplant technique [10]. Lung transplantation in the pediatric population was introduced in 1986 and the first procedure in an infant was reported in 2000. The living-related lobar transplant program was initiated by Starnes and his colleagues in the mid-1990s and has now expanded to cadaveric lobar lung transplantation [11\u201314]. Excellent results have been reported from experienced centers.",

            "text": "Over the last three decades, the indications for\ncombined heart\u2013lung and lung transplantation\nhave expanded. In adults, the main indications are COPD including emphysema and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, suppurative lung disease/cystic fibrosis ( CF), fibrotic interstitial lung disease ( ILD) including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and pulmonary vascular disease including IPAH and Eisenmenger\u2019s physiology\n(Fig. 1) In the most recent published data from the ISHLT registry, there has been a sevenfold increase in the number of lung transplants since 1990, with 33,893 lung transplants reported in 2013 and a total of 51,440 lung and 3820 heart\u2013lung procedures recorded up to mid-2014 [15]. The median survival is 5.6 years with bilateral/double lung recipients having much better median survival rates compared to single lung transplant patients (7.1 versus 4.5 years). Over the last 15 years, there has been a shift from single lung to bilateral/double lung transplant as the preferred surgical procedure. One hundred and twenty four pediatric lung transplant procedures were performed in 2013. In infants and children, there are unique pediatric conditions that require transplantation in addition to the suppurative and pulmonary vascular categories. In infants under the age of 1 year, the most common indications are IPAH or other vascular disorders, congenital heart disease, and surfactant deficiencies, while in the childhood group (1\u20135 years) IPAH and pulmonary fibrosis account for the majority of cases. In children older than 6 years, the most common indication is CF [16]. The median survival is comparable to the adult group at 5.3 years with bilateral/double recipients faring much better than single lung recipients. There has been a steady decline in the number of combined heart\u2013lung transplants in adults since 2000 with median survival rates in patients transplanted in the most recent era now similar to the lung group (5.6 years). Patients with CF, congenital heart disease, and IPAH constitute the vast majority of these cases.\n",

            "text": "Historically, the \u201ctime on the wait list\u201d has been the traditional approach to prioritizing and apportioning lung allografts. In 2005, the lung allocation score (\nLAS\n)\nwas introduced in the United States to prioritize patients on the wait-list for lung transplants based on the urgency of the patient\u2019s condition and the likelihood of survival after transplant [17]. The LAS represents a paradigm shift in transplant medicine utilizing a statistical modeling approach that calculates a \u201cwaiting list urgency measure\u201d and a \u201cpost-transplant survival measure.\u201d A numeric transplant benefit is calculated from the simple subtraction of these entities and then a normalized LAS is enumerated by a mathematical formula. The LAS score then determines the placement with higher scores reflecting sicker patients with greater expected benefit. Although still controversial, there are published data showing reduction of both the number of deaths on the waitlist and waitlist times (from years to months) [18\u201320]. It has also led to an increase in the proportion of patients transplanted for IPF and a decline in those transplanted for COPD [15]. There have been a number of recent studies that have shown that the overall survival time has not changed, reflecting the problem that sicker patients are now being transplanted. Not surprisingly, patients with high LAS scores have higher post-transplant complications [20]. The LAS approach has also had an impact on the selection of transplant procedure (single versus bilateral/double lung transplant) [21]. The impact of organ distribution in the pediatric setting is significantly more controversial, particularly in children under the age of 12 years [22, 23]. In this age group, the combination of group waitlist times and a Priority 1 scoring system is used [23, 24]. The LAS system is utilized for children older than 12 years of age in the US. Infants may be considered for an ABO-incompatible procedure as they have not yet developed preformed antibodies against ABO blood antigens, but there is very little published clinical experience with this approach [25].",

            "text": "The current criteria for donor acceptability were recently summarized by the ISHLT [26]. These reflect in large part the accumulated historical experience of transplant programs and a conservative approach to donor evaluation. Briefly, the \u201c ideal donor\u201d would have most or all of the following characteristics: age under 55 years, ABO blood compatibility, normal chest X-ray, and absence or limited smoking history (<20 pack-years), comparable size matching, graft ischemia time of less than 6 h, and absence of aspiration or septic episodes, prior thoracic surgery, prior malignancy, organisms on a sputum gram stain, or purulent secretions at the time of bronchoscopy. Strict adherence to these requirements has traditionally resulted in limited utilization rates of potential allografts in the range of 5\u201320 %. Over the past decade, a number of studies have questioned some or all of these criteria and many centers have focused on revised criteria to assess and potentially accept more donor lungs. Snell and colleagues have sub-classified this \u201c extended donor pool\u201d into two groups: (1) General medical issues such as prior history or age, and (2) Specific medical issues such as infection, pulmonary edema, etc. [27]. Both categories may have potential clinical consequences for the recipient such as late complications in the first group and primary graft dysfunction ( PGD) and other early complications in the second group. On occasion, the pathologist may be asked to perform frozen-section examination of a pulmonary nodule or consolidation in a potential donor situation. Tissue should be sent for microbiologic testing in all cases and histochemical or immunohistochemical staining for bacterial, fungal, or viral organisms should be obtained on the permanent sections as warranted.",

In addition to the living-related lobar donations described previously, attention is now focused on the potential role of cadaveric donation after circulatory cessation/determination of death (\nDCDD\n)\n. Based on a series of elegant experiments in a canine model by Egan et al. and other investigators, it was determined that the lung utilizes passive diffusion throughout the alveolar parenchyma rather than direct perfusion as a mechanism for aerobic metabolism. As a result, the lung has an extended period of viability following circulatory arrest [28\u201330]. In several centers, this method of organ procurement has been adopted into their clinical programs. There are limited published survival results, but most series suggest comparable or slightly better results at time points in the first 2 years after transplant [31\u201334]. A recent report raised concern for the diminished survival and freedom from bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS) in this group compared to the traditional group and therefore additional medium- and long-term studies are needed [35].",

The technique has been used in selected centers in Europe and North America in both the experimental and clinical settings. Studies by Steen and colleagues in Sweden and Cypel and colleagues in Toronto utilize continuous anterograde perfusion with a hyperoncotic acellular preservation solution and ventilation of the lungs by ventilator at a normothermic setting [36, 37]. Deoxygenation of the perfusate is manipulated by an oxygenator containing hypoxic gas. The technique allows lung perfusion for up to 12 h. Recent studies by the Toronto group have also demonstrated the utility of gene therapy with adenovirus vector encoding human interleukin-10 to reverse the pro-inflammatory milieu of the injured lung [38].

Its severity is variable, but it can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Although some risk factors have been enumerated, there are no specific biomarkers. Recently, molecular techniques have been implemented and show promise for future clinical application. Kaneda and colleagues [42] investigated cytokine mRMA expression from lung biopsy samples obtained before implantation of the allograft. A step-wise logistic regression analysis for 30-day mortality found that the ratio of IL-6/IL-10 was most predictive (p = 0.0013). Using a gene expression profile technique, Anraku and colleagues [43] found that the overexpression of four genes (ATP11B, FGFR2, EGLN1, and MCPH1) was predictive for the development of PGF. In another study from the Toronto group [44], lung allografts with low surfactant protein-A mRNA expression prior to implantation exhibited reduced survival. In their most recent molecular work, pre-implant-elevated levels of IL-6 mRNA correlated with the subsequent development of the BOS component\nof chronic lung allograft dysfunction ( CLAD) [45]. Other molecular approaches to the lung allograft have identified innate immune and inflammatory pathways that may be responsible for post-transplant parenchymal injury [46, 47]. Further studies will be needed to confirm the predictive and prognostic utility of these molecular studies.\n",

Many, but not all, patients will have had video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS) biopsies as part of their diagnostic work-up and it is important to have the biopsy reviewed for accurate classification. There is a difference in the rate of progression and prognosis of usual interstitial pneumonia ( UIP) and NSIP. With the introduction of pirfenidone in the treatment of IPF, the pace of the disease as demonstrated by lung function, exercise tolerance, and survival has been altered [55]. Further, the diagnosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis should warrant a careful occupational, drug, and environmental exposure history to eliminate the risk of disease recurrence in the allograft. In some cases, the diagnosis of ILD is associated with a collagen vascular disorder and patients with scleroderma-associated ILD should be carefully evaluated for concurrent pulmonary hypertension or malignancy.",

In most cases, these are discovered incidentally at the time of transplant during the pathologic examination of the explant [63, 64]. The prognosis depends on tumor stage. With the interest in extended donor and recipient criteria such as older age and light smoking history, the incidence of occult carcinomas is likely to expand. Other clinical scenarios for lung cancer in the transplant setting include lung cancer arising in the native lung after transplant and bronchogenic carcinoma occurring in the transplanted lung. An equally unique but controversial group is the cohort of patients transplanted specifically for pulmonary adenocarcinoma [65\u201370]. Prior to the recently adopted multidisciplinary classification of lung adenocarcinoma, these tumors were all grouped as \u201cbronchioloalveolar carcinoma\u201d or \u201c BAC.\u201d In the new scheme, tumors formerly called BAC are now classified into nonmucinous lesions [adenocarcinoma in situ ( AIS) , minimally invasive adenocarcinoma ( MIA) , lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma ( LPA) ] and mucinous adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2) . The majority of mucinous adenocarcinomas are thought to be invasive based on one or more of the current diagnostic criteria: size (>3 cm), amount of invasion (>0.5 cm), multiple nodules, or lack of a circumscribed border with miliary spread into the adjacent lung tissue [71]. In a recent review of the topic, Kachala and Murthy identify a total of 70 cases: two of the larger series represent a multicenter collection of data collected by the ISHLT Registry or the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database, and most of the reported studies are case reports or small case series [69, 70, 72]. None of the reports had rigorous application of the new nomenclature and applied terminology such as \u201cdiffuse\u201d or \u201cmultifocal BAC.\u201d Nonetheless, there are important points that should be emphasized from the studies. Firstly, although lung transplantation may be considered for highly selected patients with AIS and MIA, there is a significant risk of local recurrence. De Perrot et al. reported recurrences in 13 of the 22 patients who survived the procedure ranging from 5 to 49 month; overall 5-year survival in the group was inferior to the lung transplant group (39 % versus 53 %) [69]. Bilateral lung transplant may be a superior option to limit recurrences. Secondly, the diagnosis must be established by surgical excision and not a small biopsy to firmly establish the pathologic classification ( AIS versus MIA versus PLA). Interestingly, many of the transplant recipients showed a mucinous pattern that would be classified as invasive adenocarcinoma in the current scheme. Thirdly, all patients should be carefully staged to exclude mediastinal nodal involvement. Finally, transplantation should be considered after failure of conventional medical treatment. EGFR mutations can be demonstrated in a minority of young, non-smokers with LPA and this group may benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitor\ns [73].\n",

The explanted lung specimen should be carefully evaluated to establish the primary diagnosis and to exclude secondary complications such as infections or occult malignancies [74, 75]. In the setting of pulmonary vascular disease, the distinction of IPAH from chronic recurrent thromboembolic disease ( CRPE) is important as patients with CRPE are at risk for recurrent injury to the allograft.

Finally, the important role of the postmortem examination for its clinical and educational functions must be emphasized. We attempt to obtain permission for autopsy evaluation of every deceased thoracic transplant recipient and discuss in detail the clinical and pathological findings in a multidisciplinary setting. It is not uncommon to find clinically significant missed diagnoses in postmortem studies. Akindipe and colleagues found a discrepancy between the autopsy findings and clinically suspected cause of death in 20 % of cases: the most common overlooked diagnoses were HAR, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, high grade ACR, and disseminated fungal infection [76].",

While we generally use a similar approach for handling explanted specimens, it is important to review the electronic clinical records and discuss unusual or uncommon diagnoses with the clinicians prior to the gross dissection. Specimen photography can be a helpful adjunct in the evaluation. The lungs are individually weighed and measured and any missing segments or lobes are noted. The lung explant is usually received in the fresh state and is inflated through the bronchus with 10 % neutral-buffered formalin or other standard fixative under slightly elevated passive pressures. We allow overnight fixation. The pleural surface is examined for adhesions, disruptions, cobblestone change, scars, or retractions. Following retrieval of hilar lymph nodes and an en-face section of the proximal bronchovascular margins, we cut the lung in an axial plane to allow correlation with CT imaging. Sectioning along a sagittal plane is alternative approach for cases of pulmonary hypertension as it enhances the gross alterations of the vasculature. Historically, specimen angiograms or bronchograms were performed primarily as a research protocol [77]. We recommend at least one section per lobe, all hilar and peribronchial lymph nodes and multiple sections of any gross abnormality found on examination. We routinely perform a silver stain such as a Gomori-methanamine-silver ( GMS) to exclude fungal airway colonization or active infection. Additional histochemical stains such as elastin and collagen stains for connective tissue or vascular evaluation or stains for microorganisms are obtained on a case-by-case basis.\n",

Liberal use of connective tissue stains to evaluate airways for submucosal fibrous thickening and the vessels for transplant vasculopathy is essential. Further, histochemical staining for fungal and mycobacterial organisms and immunohistochemical staining for viral and parasitic inclusions are routinely performed.

In some centers, asymptomatic patients are followed without protocol TBBx sampling and they reserve the biopsy for clinical indications such as new onset of symptoms or decline in pulmonary function [83, 84]. The goal of surveillance biopsy is the identification of treatable processes such as infection or acute rejection before allograft dysfunction develops, to identify potential risk factors for chronic airway rejection and ultimately to delay or prevent OB. This stems in large part from the poor sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms, radiological techniques and functional techniques in distinguishing acute rejection, infection, and airway anastomotic complications. As a result, the TBBx is widely regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for the evaluation of the pulmonary allograft. TBBx is a safe, invasive procedure in experienced hands, but there are potential serious complications such as bleeding and pneumothorax\n[85]. There are also technical and interpretative issues. Many of the pathologic processes affecting the allograft are patchy in distribution and may be \u201cmissed\u201d by TBBx; these include ACR, LB, and OB\n. The criteria for the diagnosis and reporting of ACR and other forms of allograft rejection were established by the ISHLT and have undergone a series of modifications and revisions by the Lung Rejection Study Group in 1996 and 2007 [86\u201388]. Arcosoy et al. [89] recently reported the interobserver variability for the grading of ACR; a central panel of transplant pathologists reviewed over 1500 biopsies from 845 patients performed at 20 transplant centers. The kappa value for interobserver agreement was 0.183. Cases were upgraded from no rejection to ACR in 9 % of cases, downgraded from treatable rejection categories to no rejection or low-grade rejection in 35 % of cases, and cases of low-grade rejection were downgraded to no rejection in 36 % of cases and upgraded to treatable rejection in 19 % (95 % CI 0.147\u20130.220). In many cases, the biopsies were deemed \u201cungradeable\u201d using the ISHLT criteria. In another interobserver study of 59 biopsies for ACR, only moderate agreement was shown between pathologists (kappa 0.470). There was less robust agreement for the diagnosis of either airway inflammation or OB. Excellent intraobserver agreement, however, was found (kappa 0.795) [90]. In addition to the interpretative challenges, there are a number of technical issues. Tissue atelectasis and artifactual distortion are found to varying degrees with every TBBx sample. Gentle agitation of the biopsy pieces by a swirling motion of the formalin container can reduce atelectasis. The liberal use of leveled sections and connective tissue stains may resolve the problem of crush artefactual distortion and render a biopsy fragment interpretable in some cases.",

Other fixatives such as B5 or Bouin\u2019s may interfere with immunohistochemistry or other ancillary studies and each lab should carefully establish their optimal thresholds. In the 1990 and 1996 versions, it was recommended that each piece should contain bronchioles and greater than 100 air sacs, but this specific requirement was omitted from the 2007 document [86\u201388]. Additional pieces may be necessary if focal processes such as parenchymal nodules or OB are the primary diagnostic considerations. Further, centers that utilize IF staining for the diagnosis of AMR will require one or more additional tissue pieces in saline or another appropriate fixative before snap freezing. Electron microscopy has no role in routine transplant biopsy evaluation, but may be part of research protocols. It is important to emphasize that frequently five pieces alone will not be sufficient as one or more piece is composed of entirely of airway wall, strips of airway mucosa, blood vessel, or thrombus and so generous sampling is encouraged.",

The specific methodologies differ among institutions, but generally small aliquots of normal saline are instilled in the airways and then aspirated by manual or mechanical suction. Fractions of the fluid are sent for microbiological testing, cytopathologic evaluation, and for cell count and differential quantitation. The exclusion of bacterial or fungal infection is important in the early postoperative period and in patients with chronic airway rejection. Viral organisms can be seen on routine Papanicolaou or May-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa-stained preparations and fungal organisms can be visualized with fungal stains such as GMS or predigested PAS (Fig. 4). Some centers analyze the functional characteristics of the cells retrieved from the lavage as an adjunct test for infection and acute and chronic rejection [95]. On occasion, ACR can present with increased levels of eosinophils in the BAL and may predict poorer outcomes [96, 97]. BAL characteristics such as the predominance of lymphocytes or neutrophils, the CD4:CD8 ratio, the mean percentage of neutrophils, and lavage levels of myeloperoxidase have been analyzed as predictors of patient outcomes and in patients with\nBOS [98, 99].\n",

A limited number of studies published in the pediatric and adult transplant populations have shown similar findings [100\u2013103]. The majority of patients underwent OLB by way of a mini-thoracotomy incision and the biopsies were usually performed in the early or late transplant periods. The most common indications were unexplained deteriorating pulmonary dysfunction after thorough clinical, serological, and bronchoscopic evaluation or the onset of new or persistent pulmonary infiltrates or nodules.

There is a role for touch imprints stained with Diff-Quik (Dade-Behring, Newark, NJ) and frozen section examination to provide an initial impression of infection versus rejection versus PTLD and to direct the handling of tissue for special studies such as cytogenetics and molecular analysis. Tissue should always be sent for microbiological cultures. We gently inflate the wedge biopsy specimen with formalin using a 25- or 27-guage needle (Fig. 5). This promotes tissue expansion of the airspaces and airways and prevents tissue atelectasis and architectural distortion. Following adequate fixation time of at least 3 h, the wedge is thinly sectioned and submitted for overnight processing. Complications were reported in 5\u201325 % of cases and ranged from minor issues such as wound infection, postoperative pain, and prolonged air-leaks to more serious problems such as respiratory failure and intra-thoracic bleeding requiring surgical re-exploration. Importantly, resolution of air-leaks occurred in all patients, although the course was protracted in some cases.

Clinically, patients present with abrupt onset of respiratory failure with a sharp increase in mean pulmonary artery and airway pressures, release of copious amounts of bloody, frothy fluid into the airways, dramatic decline in pulmonary compliance, and a drop in both systemic blood pressure and arterial oxygenation.

Currently, the primary goal is prevention of HAR by identifying patients at high risk, e.g., prior pregnancies, transfusions or transplantation, or underlying connective tissue disorders, and depletion of PRA by plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) prior to transplant in presensitized patients.",

Following transplantation extended ventilatory requirements, line placements, nutritional problems, and diminished ambulation contribute to the development of nosocomial infections. Likewise, recipient factors such as paranasal sinus and airway bacterial colonization in CF patients, smoking history, older age, nutritional and functional deconditioning, and the intense level of immunosuppression after transplant are significant risk factors.

Vascular and/or airway complications are often multifactorial, influenced by donor-related, surgical, and immunosuppressive factors. Colonization of the donor airways by bacteria or fungi, size mismatch of donor and recipient airways or vessels, the use of positive pressure mechanical ventilation and the subsequent tension placed on the anastomosis, devitalization of the proximal airways by bronchial artery ligation, and the delay in graft healing due to immunosuppression all play a role in the initiation and progression of anastomotic problems. King-Biggs and colleagues reported high rates of airway dehiscence in patients receiving Sirolimus in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs when initiated early after transplant [137].

The majority of venous difficulties occur early after transplant and present with signs and symptoms of persistent pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, hemodynamic instability, high pulmonary capillary pressure, and parenchymal consolidation [139]. Systemic embolization and stroke are also potential complications of pulmonary vein thrombosis. Complete venous obstruction causes hemorrhagic infarction of the lung if surgical revision of the anastomosis is not performed promptly. Transesophageal echocardiography is an effective modality for assessing the anastomosis and for detecting obstruction. Other techniques that have been used include CT or MRI and CT angiography. Reports of late venous complications have also been reported [140]. Currently, therapeutic options for vascular disruptions range from medical therapy to either catheter-based interventions with stents or surgical revision [141].",

            "text": "The TBBx has come to be regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for the diagnosis and classification of ACR. As previously discussed, TBBx in most centers is performed as part of a surveillance protocol or for clinical indications with the latter typically demonstrating higher diagnostic yields. The\nprincipal histopathologic features\nof ACR center on the presence of mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates in the perivascular tissue planes with/without extension along adjacent alveolar interstitial structures and into airspaces. With increasing grades of rejection, the cellular infiltrates may become more polymorphous with eosinophils and scattered neutrophils and subendothelial mononuclear cell infiltrates or endothelialitis may be observed. Further, the conducting airways including cartilaginous bronchi and bronchioles can have concurrent lymphocytic mural infiltrates that are designated as lymphocytic bronchitis or bronchiolitis. The A grade designates the grade of ACR and the B grade designates the airway inflammation [88] (Table 3) . The immunophenotypic composition of the infiltrate is CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, CD68+ macrophages, and CD21+ dendritic cells; CD138+ plasma cells and CD20+ B-cells are uncommon.\n\nGrade AX (\nUngradeable Specimen\n)\nA numeric grade cannot be rendered because of insufficient (<4\u20135 adequate) pieces of tissue, crush artefactual distortion, etc.\nGrade A0 (No Evidence of Rejection/\nNER\n)\nNo perivascular infiltrates are seen in an adequate biopsy sample.\nGrade A1 (\nMinimal Acute Rejection\n)\nLimited, infrequent circumferential cuffs of mononuclear inflammatory cells around one or a few venules or arterioles. Small and large, transformed lymphocytes with occasional plasmacytoid cells form perivascular rings of 2\u20133 cell layers (Fig. 10). These are generally inconspicuous at low power, but can be detected at high power magnification.\n\nGrade A2 (\nMild Acute Rejection\n)\nPerivascular infiltrates are readily observed at scanning magnifications and are composed of more than three cell layers in thickness. The composition includes small and transformed lymphocytes, macrophages and, not infrequently, eosinophils. The infiltrates are restricted to the perivascular spaces and do not extend along the alveolar septa (Fig. 11). Besides the extent of the infiltrates and the presence of eosinophils in Grade A2, another feature that distinguishes it from Grade A1 is the presence of endothelialitis or intimitis. Further, coexisting airway inflammation is more common in mild rejection than minimal rejection in our experience. The liberal use of leveled sections rather than immunohistochemistry is often helpful in borderline cases. In most centers, ACR Grade A2 is the threshold for instituting augmented immunosuppression on account of concern for immune-mediated damage of the allograft and the risk of developing CLAD [144] .\n\nGrade A3 (\nModerate Acute Rejection\n)\nThe hallmarks of moderate rejection include the frequency and density of the perivascular cuffs and the extension of the inflammatory infiltrates along peribronchiolar alveolar septa and into alveolar spaces (Fig. 12). The latter is often characterized by macrophage and lymphocyte collections within alveolar spaces and type 2 changes of the alveolar epithelium. Endothelialitis is often present and concurrent airway inflammation may also be found.\n\nGrade A4 (\nSevere Acute Rejection\n)\nWe rarely encounter this stage of ACR today. Most patients are symptomatic with marked dyspnea and acute hypoxemia respiratory failure. In addition to the perivascular, interstitial and airspace mononuclear infiltrates and endothelialitis ACR Grade A4 exhibit parenchymal damage such as alveolar damage, hyaline membranes, necrotic cellular debris, alveolar hemorrhage, and often a conspicuous neutrophilic component (Fig. 13). Vasculitis, thrombosis, and parenchymal infarction are seen in the late stages.\n\n",

In CMV pneumonitis\n, however, there is a predominance of interstitial and septal changes over the perivascular findings. Secondly, prominent perivascular edema, small neutrophilic microabscesses, cytological atypia of the alveolar lining cells, and concurrent acute airway inflammation favor infection over ACR [147]. Consequently, the diagnosis of ACR is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be evaluated together with available clinical, serological, immunohistochemical, and microbiologic information. In cases where the distinction remains unresolved, the Lung Rejection Study Group recommends that the pathologist indicates which process is favored and recommend a prompt repeat biopsy after an appropriate period of antimicrobial therapy [87].",

Small vessels in the walls of the airways can display a circumferential inflammatory cell cuff as part of BALT and should not be confused with ACR. In some cases, the use of additional leveled sections is helpful in demonstrating the airway locale; alternatively, IHC shows collections of CD20+ B-cells in BALT foci. The confusion of BALT for ACR accounted for some of the discrepancy in the ACR readings between local and central pathologists in the study by Arcasoy and colleagues [89]. Mononuclear cellular collections within interlobular septa in the absence of a perivascular distribution likewise should not be classified as ACR.

Firstly, it is not uncommon to find different patterns of severity of ACR in a transbronchial or VATS biopsy. For example, one piece of tissue may display a pattern of minimal rejection and another show mild or moderate ACR. The designated grade is based on the most advanced grade of rejection and not the predominant pattern. Secondly, some samples may exhibit ACR, but with less than the recommended five pieces of alveolated tissue. We advocate a descriptive diagnosis such as \u201cMild acute rejection in a suboptimal/borderline adequate sample\u201d and refrain from a numeric grade to alert the clinician to the ACR. The concern for a higher grade of ACR in the lung must be considered in this setting. Thirdly, the diagnosis of ACR requires that the inflammatory infiltrate is completely circumferential around the vessel. The arrangement can vary from compact, \u201ctight\u201d collections to more loosely arranged cuffs. The problem of a partial rather than complete cuff is not uncommon. Additional leveled sectioning of the paraffin block resolves many of these problematic cases. In equivocal cases, we report the findings and recommend careful clinical and microbiological correlation to exclude an infectious etiology. Fourthly, it is not uncommon to find a number of different pathologies in a TBBx sample [148]. For example, we have observed concurrent cases of ACR and OB in patients transplanted more than 1 year. All significant findings should be documented in the pathology report irrespective of the overall adequacy of the sample.",

As described previously, ACR can have concurrent airway mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates. If other etiologies (especially infection) are excluded, the infiltrates represent airway rejection. In the absence of ACR, active small airway inflammation without associated scarring is classified as lymphocytic bronchiolitis, LB. The grading of airway inflammation has been revised and simplified since the 1990 and 1996 ISHLT versions (Table 3). Currently, the previous minimal and mild LB grades (previously B1 and B2) are compressed to low-grade small airway inflammation and the numerical grade B1R is used to indicate the revised grade [88]. Low-grade LB\nis characterized by submucosal mononuclear inflammation. The patterns range from patchy or scattered infiltrates to circumferential bands of mononuclear cells (Fig. 14). Eosinophils are found occasionally, but in small numbers, and by definition, mononuclear cells are not seen within epithelial cells. High-grade small airway disease and its numeric counterpart B2R replaced the moderate and severe LB grades (originally B3 and B4) of the previous grading scheme. It is defined by the presence of dense mononuclear cells in the bronchiolar submucosa including small and transformed lymphocytes admixed with other inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and plasma cells in association with intra-epithelial infiltrates and epithelial injury. The degree of epithelial injury ranges from respiratory cell necrosis and metaplasia to epithelial sloughing, ulceration, and cellular and fibrinous exudates (Fig. 15) . Grade B0 is defined as the absence of airway inflammation and Grade BX indicates that the biopsy specimen is ungradeable on account of absence of airways, tangential sectioning, artifactual distortion of airways, or infection.\n\n",

Neutrophilic capillaritis was defined as patchy or diffuse alveolar septal neutrophilic infiltrates containing cellular karyorrhetic debris with or without microvascular thrombi, alveolar hemorrhage, or airspace accumulations of neutrophils. Neutrophilic margination, in distinction, lacked the injurious components. These patterns were identified as infrequent, but reasonably specific for AMR. Additional morphologic patterns that were reported in AMR included persistent or recurrent ACR, high-grade LB, OB, ALI with or without hyaline membranes. As previously discussed, ALI can be seen in a variety of lung transplant conditions injury such as infection, high-grade ACR, drug toxicity, and ischemic/preservation injury.

Not surprisingly, lung transplant recipients are perhaps the most susceptible of the solid organ transplant group and this risk extends to all pediatric and adult patients.

These include the immunomodulating viruses of the herpes group ( CMV, EBV and others), fungal infections caused by Aspergillus species and Pneumocystis jiroveci, bacterial infections such as nocardiosis and mycobacterial infections, and rarely, parasitic infections [188]. After 6 months, most patients have achieved their lowest maintenance immunosuppression levels and are at risk primarily for community-acquired infections. Importantly, community-acquired respiratory viruses can cause serious clinical infections and trigger acute rejection episodes or promote the development of chronic rejection [189]. Opportunistic infections can also occur in the late period in patients treated with augmented immunosuppression for recurrent acute rejection episodes or to arrest the progression of BOS. With the widespread use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for specific bacterial, viral, and fungal organisms, new patterns and etiologies of infectious complication are now emerging [190].",

Scedosporium species (formally Pseudoallescheria) are indistinguishable from Aspergillus on morphology and by radiological techniques. They cause a similar spectrum of disease and have a poorer outcome. They are resistant to amphotericin-B and other polyene antifungal drugs, but respond to azole compounds. Cryptococcus infection is rare in pediatric lung recipients, but in adults is usually the result of reactivation. Unlike the nodular lesions found in immunocompetent hosts, alveolar or interstitial patterns are common in immunosuppressed hosts\n[200].",

In the latest revision, the concept of partial or complete reversibility is now officially recognized [221]. An essential principle is the exclusion of other causes of airway obstruction such as anastomotic narrowing, infection, acute rejection (ACR or AMR), or recurrent/progressive COPD. The numeric grades of BOS (grade 0\u20133) reflect increasing severity of obstruction. Two patterns have been identified on expiratory phase high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging, which predict to some degree of accuracy the responsiveness to azithromycin therapy. The component of bronchiolitis correlates with air trapping or hyperlucency, peribronchiolar thickening, and tree-in-bud alterations, while the OB-related form shows septal thickening, bronchiectasis, and mosaic patterns of parenchymal attenuation [222\u2013225].",

The\nhistopathologic hallmarks\nof OB are fibro-inflammatory lesions centered on membranous and respiratory bronchioles and mature, eosinophilic collagenous submucosal fibrosis producing partial or complete obliteration of the lumens (Fig. 23). When present, mononuclear inflammatory cells are distributed within the submucosal fibrosis and/or in the peribronchiolar tissue spaces. In early lesions, abundant inflammatory and fibromyxoid aggregates may overlie and even obscure the submucosal scarring. Late OB lesions with complete luminal obliteration may be skipped over on routine stains and connective tissue stains such as elastin-van Gieson (EVG), Masson\u2019s trichrome, or combined Masson\u2019s trichrome/elastic Verhoeff\u2013van Gieson stains are helpful in identifying small airways. In the late cicatricial stages of OB, lumens are filled with mature collagenous tissue. Disruption of the elastic membrane and atrophy of the muscular layer of the airway are also seen (Fig. 24) . The scar tissue can extend distally into the alveolar ducts and sacs and septal scarring is often present. Mucostasis and/or intraluminal foam cells in the distal airways are useful markers of airway obstruction (Fig. 25).

The histopathologic findings have been described by Hwang and colleagues from Toronto [231] from wedge biopsy, postmortem, and retransplant specimens: pleural fibrosis and subpleural fibroelastosis were the most common findings and most patients had concurrent OB either within or adjacent to the fibroelastotic regions and/or regions of DAD (Fig. 26). Paraseptal, centrilobular, and parenchymal fibroelastosis were found in around a third of the cases. There was a sharp delineation of the fibroelastosis from adjacent \u201cnormal\u201d lung tissue with foci of organizing pneumonia/fibroblastic foci in the intervening regions. Although honeycomb change was distinctly uncommon, NSIP-like changes were found in up to a quarter of cases.\n",

The radiologic findings reflected the morphology with ground glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening; peripheral fibrosis and consolidation were each observed in a quarter of the cases. Patients presented with a fulminant clinical course that rapidly progressed to respiratory failure.

Several studies have shown that BAL neutrophilia at 3 and 12 months following transplant is predictive for the development of BOS. The mechanism is likely through repetitive epithelial injury and fibroinflammatory airway injury by neutrophilic release of matrix metalloproteinases, chemokines, growth factors, and oxidative stress. Azithromycin exhibits both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, and in some studies, up to 40 % of patients with BOS showed sustained improvement in their FEV1 of >10 % and a small number of patients reversed their BOS score to BOS 0 [236, 237].

There continues to be refinement of selection criteria and expansion of both the indications for transplant and the overall number of candidates. The need for increasing the donor pool is critical. The use of \u201cmarginal\u201d and reconditioned organs through EVLP has helped to identify organs that previously would have been considered unsuitable for transplant. Currently, there are only a few clinical EVLP programs in Europe and North America. With their continued achievements, the technology should become routine in most centers in the near future. This needs to be balanced with the risks of infection and PGD and their effects on overall survival, morbidity, and the risks for the development of CLAD. The therapeutic armamentarium must be expanded beyond conservative postoperative management for PGD and new interventions besides inhaled nitric oxide, inhaled surfactant, and C1-estaerase-inhibition must be found.",

The role of histopathology and immunopathology in particular is unsettled at this time. To date, there are no diagnostic histopathologic features for AMR and those with acceptable specificity appear to be infrequent. Likewise, C4d immunostaining appears to be an infrequent finding in patients with allograft dysfunction and de novo DSA. A more specific set of pathologic markers will likely be required.
