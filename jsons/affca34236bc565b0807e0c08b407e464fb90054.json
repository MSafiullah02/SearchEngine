These early uses of pooling were necessitated by scientific and technical limitations. Today, pooling experiments are driven by the potential cost savings and precision gains that can result, and they are making a substantial impact on blood screening and drug discovery. A general review of pooling experiments is given here, with additional details and discussion of issues and methods for two important application areas, namely, blood testing and drug discovery. The blood testing application is very old, from 1943, yet is still used today, especially for HIV antibody screening. In contrast, the drug discovery application is relatively new, with early uses occurring in the period from the late 1980s to early 1990s. Statistical methods for this latter application are still actively being investigated and developed through both the pharmaceutical industries and academic research. The ability of pooling to investigate synergism offers exciting prospects for the discovery of combination therapies.",

Examples quoted by Halvorson and Ziegler (1933) include investigations of densities of bacteria in milk and protozoa in soil. Prior to 1915, most dilution methods were inadequate because they failed to account for chance or error in observation. In 1915, McCrady presented a method of estimation based on probability which was then expanded by Halvorson and Ziegler (1933) to provide an estimator of density based on pooled data. Fisher (1921) also used a similar pooling-based estimator.",

In order to determine the absence or presence of bacteria in a fluid, cultures are made of a number of samples (small amounts) of the fluid. Growth of a colony of bacteria within a fluid sample indicates the presence of bacteria and no growth indicates absence of bacteria. The act of culturing this fluid can be viewed as applying a test, the result of which is \"good\" or \"bad\". This test is applied simultaneously to every molecule present in that sample of fluid and the results for all the molecules are pooled. The combined test results (from all samples) are then used to estimate the density of bacteria present in the source fluid. Although it is virtually impossible to perform this test on individual molecules, it is quite simple to ascertain whether a culture from the pooled molecules is free of colony growth.",

This chapter focuses on current usage for populations in which individuals are labeled with respect to one or more traits and where pooling experiments are optional.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive review, but rather a vehicle for highlighting some important aspects of pooled screening in these two areas.",

One application in blood screening requires the identification of individuals with sero-prevalence (detectability in blood) of one or more diseases. Cost effectiveness is important here because a balance must be struck between the cost of testing, which can be high, and the large populations that must be screened. A second issue that arises in blood screening is the need to estimate prevalences, possibly as a function of covariates.",

Estimation involves the use of pooled samples for decreasing the cost-per-unit information when estimating the prevalence of active individuals in a population. These estimation results may then be used as the endproduct of analysis or they may be incorporated into a classification scheme. The estimation results serve as the end-product of analysis when the goal of the study is to estimate the prevalence of active individuals but there is no interest expressed in actually identifying these active individuals. In a classification scheme, the ultimate goal is screening for the purpose of identifying active individuals. The performance of a classification scheme is typically assessed by considering the expected number of tests required to identify active individuals with particular attributes. Drug discovery is considered to be a classification problem, but results from the estimation problem can also be used to inform classification decisions. For blood testing, the application may be either a classification or an estimation problem, depending on the context. The most common assumptions of pooling experiments are briefly critiqued in Section 2. In Section 3, general accomplishments and advances in pooling experiments are reviewed, irrespective of their particular applications. Sections 4 and 5 provide details specific to blood testing and drug discovery, respectively.",

In simple pooling, each individual appears in exactly one pool; see Figure 1 (a), where each circle in the box represents an individual, and individuals in the same column are in the same pool. An active pool response must be followed by individual testing to determine which specific individuals in the pool are active. In orthogonal pooling using d dimensions, individuals appear in exactly d pools; see Figure 1 (b) for d = 2. The determination of active individuals from orthogonal pooling is easier than that from simple pooling. Consider orthogonal pooling over d = 2 dimensions corresponding to rows and columns. If a compound lies simultaneously in an active row and an active column, then it is reasonable to believe that this compound is active and that it should thus be assigned a favorable rank for individual testing. Despite its benefits, orthogonal pooling adds many complexities and is, consequently, not as popular as simple pooling. All further discussion is limited to simple pooling.",

The first assumption is that individuals have equal probabilities of being active.

In drug discovery, it is well recognized that structure-activity relationships (SARs, see Chapter 4), where activity is related to chemical structural features of a compound, lead to nonconstant probabilities of activity; see McFarland and Gans (1986) .",

It is possible, however, that individually inactive compounds can give an active test result when pooled together (Borisy et al., 2003) , thus providing a case of \"activity enhancement\" by pooling. This phenomenon is called synergism and its detection is crucial to the development of combination therapies in the pharmaceutical industry. The reverse situation can also occur in that pooled testing of individually diseased samples can result in disease-free pool results (Phatarfod and Sudbury, 1994) , thus providing a case of \"activity degeneration\" by pooling. This phenomenon is called antagonism or blocking and is considered an undesirable potential effect of pooling in the blood testing application. Blocking relationships that occur in drug discovery applications can have a positive impact on screening outcomes in that they provide further implicit evidence of structure-activity relationships.",

If individuals are pooled into groups of size k and if pooling does not alter the behavior of individuals, then the resulting g = f /k pools will, independently, have the same probability \u03b8 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) k of being active. Hence, the number of active pools, X , follows a binomial distribution with parameters g and \u03b8. Of course, activity of pools or individuals must be revealed by some testing system and for now this system is assumed to be perfect. In other words, sensitivity (the probability that a test will identify, by testing outcome, an individual as active given that the individual is truly active) and specificity (the probability that a test will identify, by testing outcome, an individual as inactive given that the individual is truly inactive) are both assumed to be 1.0.

In other words, his was a classification problem and he wanted to minimize the number of tests required to classify all inductees. All individuals in inactive pools were declared to be inactive, without further testing. All individuals in active pools were subjected to one-at-a-time testing, thus leading to a random total number of tests T = f /k + Xk (where f, k, and X are defined above). Dorfman then needed to determine a pool size to minimize the expected total number of tests. Pooling would only be advantageous if, on average, the total number of tests is less than f, which is the number of tests required by one-at-a-time testing. Dorfman minimized the expected relative cost, for given p,",

For example, by pooling, he obtained an 80% cost savings in tests over one-at-a-time testing when p = .01 and k = 11. The savings decrease as p increases but are still appreciable even for larger p with, for example, 28% savings when p = .15 and k = 3. In fact, pooling, based on Dorfman retesting for classification, is better than one-at-a-time testing when 1/k < (1 \u2212 p) k . The approximation (1 \u2212 p) k \u2248 e \u2212 pk is sometimes used to claim that pooling is better than one-at-a-time testing when p < (ln k)/k. When p and k are both large, many active pools are observed and, consequently, more individual retests are required and this reduces the desirability of pooling. Despite its simplicity, Dorfman's retesting strategy is still very widely used today, especially in blood testing and drug discovery applications. His rough guidelines for choosing k such that p < (ln k)/k, coupled with recommendations by Thompson (1962) , Kerr (1971) , Loyer (1983) , and Swallow (1987) to use an a priori upper bound on p, is also commonly used today. Indeed, the attraction of the Dorfman strategy is its simplicity. Improved methods for classification, some of which are discussed in this article, add various levels of complications that users may not yet be ready to accept.",

The remaining untested individuals are then retested as a single pool and the process is repeated. Sobel and Groll (1959) proposed a retesting scheme based on nested halving procedures. Active pools are subdivided into two pools of size approximately k/2, each of which is tested. Individuals in an inactive subpool are declared inactive but an active subpool is again halved. Halving terminates when pool size becomes one, that is, at individual testing. Sobel and Elashoff (1975) proposed a general nested retesting scheme for estimation, of which nested halving is a special case. They found that a certain class of nested halving procedures is highly efficient and the savings over one-at-a-time procedures is even greater for the estimation problem than for the classification problem. They also found that, when the cost of obtaining individuals relative to the cost of a test is negligible, the optimal testing scheme does not include retesting. Chen and Swallow (1990) confirmed the finding that retesting is not advantageous for estimation when testing costs far exceed costs of obtaining individuals, but they showed that data from retesting can provide useful information for testing model assumptions.",

Thus, the estimation problem was an intermediate step, not the ultimate goal, of the drug discovery applications of these authors. On a related note, Remlinger et al.

The two most common applications are the context of classification, where the goal of blood screening is to identify individuals with seroprevalence of one or more diseases. One classification application arises from the need to screen donated blood and blood products and the other from the need to screen for individual diagnoses. Cost effectiveness, as measured by the reduction in the expected total number of tests, is the most commonly used assessment of pooling methods. The third application is the need to monitor changes in sero-prevalence over time for (possibly) different sets of individuals, where demarcation of individuals may occur along demographic lines or spatial/regional clusters.",

Recognizing that developing countries can ill-afford the cost of 100% one-at-a-time screening, WHO issued recommendations for testing for HIV antibody on serum pools (WHO, 1991) in areas where seroprevalence is less than 2%. In fact, this figure of 2% sero-prevalence is much too restrictive. Many investigators have achieved success with much higher prevalences. For example, Soroka et al. (2003) described the successful use of pooling where prevalence was 9%. It is important to note that, for screening blood supplies, complete identification of sero-positive individuals is not necessary. All that is needed is a method for tracking the complete donated sample, without personal identifiers. This makes pooled screening very attractive for screening blood supplies because donors can be assured that their anonymity will be maintained.",

Gastwirth and Hammick (1989) and Hammick and Gastwirth (1994) approached the blood testing problem with a keen eye towards preserving individual privacy rights. They proposed screening strategies designed for estimating prevalences. Rather than focus on the cost-saving advantages of pooling, these authors selected pooling because of the anonymity it provides to individuals being screened.

Unfortunately, the Western blot is very expensive, difficult to standardize and often results in no clear diagnosis for some individuals (Tamashiro et al., 1993) . To relieve the cost burden, the WHO recommends a series of repeat testing that uses cheaper tests, namely ELISA or simple or rapid tests, to avoid the Western blot while still maintaining testing accuracy. In general, the Western blot best is up to six times as expensive as rapid or simple tests and 18 times as expensive as ELISA; see, for example, WHO (1992) . Rapid and simple tests provide results in less than one hour (less than 30 minutes for rapid tests) and may be performed by personnel having little or no laboratory training.

Specifically, the assay procedure should differ from the first assay procedure in some substantial way; for example, different antigen preparation, different test principle (such as indirect versus competitive) or both.

These probabilities have been a major area of concern in pooling studies for blood testing (WHO, 1991) . The over-arching issue when screening a blood supply is whether dilution effects will cause a single sero-positive individual to be missed when combined in a pool with several (perhaps as many as 14) sero-negative individuals. This issue relates to the false negative predictive value as follows. A predictive value is the probability of truth given an individual's testing outcome; a false negative predictive value is the probability that the individual is truly active but is labeled as inactive from testing; a false-positive predictive value is the probability that the individual is truly inactive but is labeled as active from testing. When screening for diagnostic purposes, the major concern is that sero-negative individuals will be labeled sero-positive; this relates to the false positive predictive value. Repeatedly, however, studies have indicated that, under their worst performance, these possible pooling effects are negligible. In fact, Cahoon-Young et al. (1989) , Behets et al. (1990) , Archbold et al. (1991) , Sanchez et al. (1991) all reported reductions in the number of misclassified sero-negative individuals; for example, Cahoon-Young et al. (1989) found that there were seven misclassified sero-negative individuals out of 5000 tested, but no misclassified sero-negative pools out of 500 tested.",

            "text": "Large false negative predictive values are particularly troubling when screening a blood supply because they allow sero-positive samples to enter the blood supply system, thus leading to possible transmission of deadly diseases. Minimizing the false negative predictive value is probably more important than increasing cost efficiency of pooling for this application. Of course, large false negative predictive values can arise even when screening is accomplished using one-at-a-time testing. False positive predictive values are of greater concern in diagnostic testing because they can cause undue stress for the falsely identified individuals and increase testing costs. Notice that if S e = S p = 1, then FNPV = FPPV = 0 and no misclassifications will occur. Litvak et al. (1994) compared three pooling strategies and one-at-a-time testing with respect to their abilities to reduce FNPV, FPPV, the expected numbers of tests required, and the expected numbers of tests performed for each individual. The first pooling study considered was Dorfman retesting with pool size k = 15; that is, all individuals in sero-positive pools were tested one-at-a-time but no retesting was applied to individuals in sero-negative pools. The pool size of 15 was selected because, at the time, it was the largest acceptable size from a laboratory perspective for maintaining high sensitivity and specificity after pooling. Litvak et al. (1994) called this screening protocol T 0 . Their second pooling protocol, T 2 , was essentially the retesting method proposed by Sobel and Groll (1959) whereby sero-positive pools are recursively halved and testing of the subpools continues until no further splits are possible. In this strategy with k = 15, a serum sample must be positive four or five times before being declared sero-positive. Their third pooling protocol, T + 2 , is similar to T 2 except that each sero-negative pool is subjected to one confirmatory pool test before all its individuals are labeled as seronegative. It was found that T 2 and T + 2 were comparable and that both provided huge reductions in FPPV compared with one-at-a-time testing but smaller reductions compared with T 0 . For FNPV, T + 2 was the best protocol. In short, pooling reduced both false negative and false positive predictive values.",

As mentioned, in earlier sections of this chapter, approaches to solving the blood testing for classification problem do not routinely incorporate covariate information. For the HIV blood testing problem, relevant covariate information for an individual may include the following: number of blood transfusions received, number of sexual partners, number of sexual partners who are HIV-infected, syringe use, drug use, sexual preference, and HIV status of parents. Recent investigations have allowed the estimation of prevalence in different covariate-defined strata, but the number of strata is never large and is quite typically less than 10. In screening for drug discovery, on the other hand, the number of covariates is quite often at least twice the number of pooled responses available. Indeed, the significant challenges that arise from the high-dimensional-with-low-sample-size data sets that usually result from \"high-throughput screening\" in drug discovery present major obstacles to analysis, even for one-at-a-time testing results. These difficulties are magnified in the presence of pooled responses. More information is given by Langfeldt et al. (1997) , Xie et al. (2001) , Zhu et al. (2001) , Yi (2002) , and Remlinger et al.

Synergism has recently become the major supporting argument for pursuing pooling experiments in drug discovery Yi, 2002; Remlinger et al., 2005) . Synergistic relationships can only be discovered through pooling studies where compounds are forced together, and it is these synergistic relationships that form the basis of combination therapies. These therapies involve deliberate mixing of drugs and they are now the standard of care for life-threatening diseases such as cancer and HIV. Current combination therapies were discovered by combining individually active compounds after they had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. By investigating synergistic relationships in vitro, it is expected that one could find a combination where, individually, the compounds are inactive but, when pooled, their activities exceed all other combinations. Borisy et al. (2003) demonstrated this quite nicely using several real experiments. For example, chlorpromazine and pentamidin were more effective than paclitaxel (a clinically used anticancer drug), even though individually neither drug was effective at tolerable doses. Similar ideas were discussed by Tan et al. (2003) .",

Papers from these researchers have been reviewed earlier in this chapter, but a few additional comments are warranted. The bulk of the work has been divided into two major paths. One path concerns the search for the efficient placement of individuals within pools; that is, the design of pooling studies. Because of the very large number of covariates, this is a difficult problem that requires computer-intensive techniques. Remlinger et al. (2005) obtained structure-based pooling designs to assign pool placement in response to covariate-adjusted prevalences. Zhu (2000) developed model-based designs for the same problem.",

Nonparameteric results are based on recursive partitioning on pooled data and require the formation of pooled summaries and decisions of whether and how to include the retested data in the analysis without violating independence assumptions. For the semi-parametric work, Yi (2002) modeled data from pooling experiments as missing data scenarios where missingness occurs at random. This was a novel use of the semi-parametric methodology to an area that had never before been considered. Another interesting finding is that random retesting of both active and inactive pools can lead to improved estimators. Litvak et al. (1994) and Gastwirth and Johnson (1994) were able to improve their estimators in the blood testing problem by retesting inactive pools. Zhu et al. (2001) described a trinomial modeling approach that incorporates the phenomenon of blocking and used this model to develop criteria for creating pooling designs. These fully parametric models were also extended by Yi (2002) who considered pairwise blocking probabilities. Xie et al. (2001) used a Bayesian approach for modeling blockers and synergism. Finally, Remlinger et al. (2005) also considered design pooling strategies, but from a completely structure-based approach.",
