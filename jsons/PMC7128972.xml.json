This framework consists of four functional domains that include clinical care, the internal and macro-environment of the primary care/general practice, and the public health responsibilities of doctors. These functional domains were first identified by the authors through a review of the peer reviewed and gray literature that included strategies relevant to general practice at the time of an influenza pandemic, and the framework was later validated through interviews with general practitioners and practice nurses and senior decision-makers. It was subsequently used to evaluate 89 publicly available jurisdictional plans in five countries.3\n",

In Hong Kong, the Hospital Authority manages all government run GOPCs in primary care in seven geographic clusters. The role of the GOPCs is to provide access to quality clinical care in the form of primary care services to the financially vulnerable, the elderly, and patients with chronic diseases. Most GOPCs are located in the community and are often the first point of contact with public clinics among the elderly and the financially vulnerable.",

These include: (1) changes in clinical services and clinical care for influenza; (2) changes in the internal environment of primary care practice such as preventive behaviors of doctors, including hand washing and wearing a mask; (3) changes in the macro-environment of primary care practice such as the use of guidelines, training, or measures; (4) public health responsibilities such as in primary care; and (5) the impact of influenza A on quality of life, assessed using three questions: \u201cHas influenza affected the quality of your life?\u201d, \u201cDid you feel depressed in the past 2 weeks?\u201d, and \u201cDid you feel emotionally stressed in the past 2 weeks?\u201d. The questionnaire had a multiple choice design and the respondents could tick one or more of the alternatives. Moreover, the primary care practitioners were asked about whether they would be willing to be vaccinated when a vaccine was available. The survey also included questions on demographics such as age and sex, as well as educational background, postgraduate qualifications, and the type of clinic the doctor worked in. A sample of the questionnaire is provided as Supplementary Material. The questionnaire was piloted on 30 primary care practitioners before the actual distribution, and modifications were made as a result of the comments and suggestions received from the primary doctors.",

These findings were further confirmed by the data from our qualitative study. Moreover, the additional reason of thinking that they had already been infected with influenza A H1N1 might have further reduced the willingness to accept the influenza A H1N1 vaccination. These findings among doctors in our study are similar to those recently reported in Hong Kong among hospital healthcare workers, which showed community nurses having the lowest willingness to accept vaccination.11 Starting in 2010, all seasonal influenza vaccines have included the swine flu component. Whether this will help to ease some fear is unknown. Of note, current available surveillance data suggest no increase in adverse events with swine flu vaccines compared to seasonal flu vaccines.12 Acceptability of pandemic influenza vaccination was found to be higher in studies conducted in general practice in France and the Netherlands, at 60% and 80%, respectively.6, 7 Similar to findings from previous studies on the same issue, the major concerns for both nurses and doctors with respect to influenza A H1N1 vaccination were fear of side effects and concerns regarding the efficacy of the new vaccine.6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14 Annual vaccination against influenza has been considered to be the best way to reduce sickness and death from influenza in high-risk populations, to reduce absenteeism from work in healthy adults, and to minimize healthcare-associated transmission of influenza.15, 16, 17\n",
