At large, there has also been a lack of research studies that comprehensively addresses the key challenges of BDA, or which investigates opportunities for new theories or emerging practices.

As at the time of this research, the only study that focuses on evaluation of BDA tools, Hadoop, Spark, and Flink is from performance perspective [16]. This means that the gap remains, which this study aimed to address. Thus, the aim of this study was to propose a solution through a model that can be used to evaluate BDA tools in selecting the most appropriate for organisations\u2019 purposes. Thus, the objectives of this study were: (1) To determine the factors (technical and business) that influence the selection of big data analytics in organisations; and (2) To establish criteria for appropriateness of big data analytics tools in an organisation.",

In this study, criteria consist of two main components, which are the business requirements and IT requirements. Business requirements is mostly connected with the goals, mission and objective, which come from the organisation vision. Business requirements work toward paving and setting what the business seeks to achieve. The IT requirements are based on attributes such as technology types, co-existence and compatibility, capacity, and flexibility of technologies. The IT requirements seek to enable and support the business requirements toward achieving the objectives of the organisation. This also means IT can be a constraint in that deficiency within the IT will have negative impact on the business requirements.",

Another significance factor in creating criteria is that it minimizes the chances of duplicating analytics tools for the same or similar purpose, and it mitigates against risks.",

However, alignment does not refer to being aligned or not aligned, rather it how the relationship needs to be adjusted based on business unforeseen event [44]. Some of the most important and crucial contributors identified in the alignment between business/IT in the selection of BDA tools are communication and uniformity. Communication plays a significance role between the business and IT units in decision making. In addition, the uniformity of how things are done, following processes and policies of an organisation is important.",
