However, the information technology (IT) change has been more rapid outside than within the healthcare industry [44]. The modern medical environment is now experiencing major transformation in its IT base with increasing in technological complexity and handling more patients with fewer resources, and resulting in higher demands on medical practitioners [14]. The information system (IS) discipline confronted similar transformations in other industries and developed theories and methods that should prove useful in healthcare applications [44]. Consequently, this study employed a mature framework available in IS discipline to explain the adoption decision of IT innovation in hospitals.",

A completed EMR should include the authentication of a physician's e-signature and the electronic records of patients that can be transmitted within or between hospitals. Thereby, the lack of standardization of e-signatures impedes exchange and sharing of medical data [40]. There are at least three distinct motivations underlying our study. Firstly, a law pertaining to e-signature was enacted and was formally promulgated in 2002. Secondly, the Department of Health (DOH) of Taiwan adapted Public Key as an infrastructure and set up the Healthcare Certification Authority (HCA) in 2003. A total of 8000 IC cards were issued to medical institutes and more than 30,000 IC cards were issued to medical staff. Thirdly, the astonishing rapid spread of the intra-hospital transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic killed 84 people in Taiwan and speeds up the exchange of EMR between hospitals to track the potential contagion.",

Adopting e-signature is not only a simple activity to purchase the required hardware and software, but rather a social interaction process among users, organizations, and the environment. While implementing IS, organizational managers are suggested to focus on critical success factors for promptly responding to important events [15], [25]. The process of making an innovation adoption decision is essentially an information-seeking and information-processing activity in which the adopter is motivated to reduce uncertainty about the advantages and disadvantages of an innovation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to build an analysis framework to identify the critical factors that affect hospital adoption of e-signature for the further promotion of EMR.",

In the medical industry, adopting e-signature technology allows physicians to sign on medical records in a more timely and efficient manner and hence exchange EMR among different healthcare providers when it is necessary. According to Waegemann [41], when medical institutions attempt to accomplish EMR, they not only need to establish certification, access control, and an e-signature system, but also guarantee the completeness and safety in integrating medical data. In 2002, Lin [24] surveyed all 590 hospitals and 3162 clinics in Taiwan, and found that about 60% of hospital respondents and more than half of the clinic respondents felt that the Law of E-Signature would help develop EMR.",

The measurement of this study was first derived from theoretical bases and references and then followed up by review of the expert panel to ensure the effectiveness of the questionnaire. In addition, discriminant validity focuses on whether one can empirically differentiate the construct from other constructs [21]. Since the sample size is less than 100, it is not suitable for factor analysis, which requires the sample size to be at least 100 or 5 times that of the number of variables to be analyzed [10], [13]. The Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin (KMO) [20] statistical analysis is used instead. The results show that the KMO for the organizational (0.729), environmental (0.812), and e-signature (0.804) dimensions are greater than the threshold of 0.50. Therefore, the factors used in this study are appropriate. Meanwhile, the Bartlett's Test of Sphericity correlative coefficients among measured items can be used to extract factors for factor analysis. In this study, the results of Bartlett's Test of Sphericity are all significant in the three dimensions (see Table 2\n).",

For synchronic discriminant, two important indexes, which explain discriminant analysis results, are discriminant loading and standardized discriminant coefficient [13]. Using discriminant loading can avoid the collinear problem and is relatively stable when analyzing small samples. The standardized discriminant coefficient is used to compare the relative importance of predicting variables [7]. In general, discriminant loading has to be greater than 0.3 to be significant.

This finding is consistent with prior related research [32], [38]. The hospital size effect confirmed the prior research of organization size affecting innovation adoption [36]. According to this study, larger hospitals tend to adopt e-signature more than smaller hospitals do. Although vendor support is also a significant factor to distinguish e-signature adopters and non-adopters as indicated in the prior studies [45], non-adopters in this study value vendor support significantly higher than adopters. The possible reason may be that the adopters have gained experience during the cooperation and therefore rate the vendor support less important compared to non-adopters. Finally, adopters foresaw the impact of government policy higher than the non-adopters and therefore were willing to adopt e-signature. This finding also confirmed the results in the Ho and associates' study [16].",

However, these four factors were not supported in this study which reveals some insights about the nature of the healthcare industry. There are two possible reasons why the findings of this study vary from prior studies. Firstly, previous studies surveyed multiple organizations in multiple industries. Unlike for-profit organizations, hospitals in Taiwan are consistently centralized to a high degree [3] therefore the user involvement is deemed to be less important compared to that in other industries. Secondly, vendors of healthcare technology in Taiwan habitually provide total solution from adding gateways to on-site training or consulting to link the new technology to the buyers' IS. Therefore, all hospitals perceived system complexity is low. In terms of security, all the respondents perceived similar importance with means of 3.99 and 4.03 for adopter and non-adopter respectively. In other words, both adopters and non-adopters considered security indifferently. Summarized from the results of this study, the research model is refined as Fig. 2\nshown below.",

Firstly, the respondents might tend to favor the technology and are therefore more willing to mail back the questionnaire. Secondly, all the variables in our framework are selected from the IS related literature. In other words, the important variables concerning the healthcare industry might not be included in this study. Lastly, this study uses static cross sectional approach, which may not reveal the dynamics of the technology adoption processes. Considering the ability to adopt IT, this study limited the scope to all regional hospitals and medical centers in Taiwan that have an IS department. Meanwhile, the surveyed subjects are executives or directors of each hospital information department. The users in practice that include physicians, system designers, and other employees may obtain different view-points about the technology. Therefore, more rigorous study is needed to further explore issues uncovered by this study. For instance a longitudinal study would provide more insight into the adoption process.",

Suggestions to increase the e-signature diffusion rate are as follows. Firstly, to enlarge hospital size is to increase the number of patient beds, to hire more medical employees, or to increase business volume of a hospital by the definition of this study. However, the number of beds to population in Taiwan is twice that number in the US, which may represent a waste of medical resources [22].

This report also confirmed the effort of the Taiwanese government to build its electronic services infrastructure and the possibility of constructing EMR. Although the SARS threat has subsided provisionally, other epidemics such as Avian Influenza may cause a serious threat anytime and anywhere. This study suggests the government take a stronger position to provide financial aid and educate the non-adopters. Especially for the underprivileged hospitals, such as smaller hospitals without sufficient IS personnel, more cooperation or direct supports from the government are needed in order to help them adopt e-signature. Secondly, reducing uncertainty of policies, not only regulations for e-signature but also the reimbursement related to the promotion of e-signature, is needed. As the majority of hospital funds come from the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) reimbursement, stable and favorable e-signature BNHI policies are very important to a hospital's decision to adopt e-signature. With EMR, a patient who is infected with a disease or who has visited a contaminated hospital can be tracked or identified at the beginning of the medical care process to alert the medical care staff of the need for precaution.",
