Klok et al. [21] have found in a population of 184 ICU patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, a DVT incidence of 27% and 81% of pulmonary embolism (PE). Probably, our lower incidence of DVT than Klok was correlated to the lower number of patients included in the study. Moreover, in our study two cases of PE were incidental; therefore, we cannot really establish the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in these patients.",

Recent evidence showed that \u201ccytokine storms\u201d triggered by COVID-19 infection can cause clotting disorders which may increase the risk of thromboembolism [1]. Sepsis is considered a risk factor for VTE, including upper and lower extremity DVT and PE [22]. The underlying pathogenesis of VTE in sepsis remains incompletely understood but is believed to be the result of multiple factors. In addition to risk factors for hypercoagulability, as originally described by Virchow, incorporating the three original triad (stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability), severe inflammation observed in patient with sepsis and/or septic shock represents the fourth factor for thromboembolic complications [23]. Inflammation increases pro-coagulant factors, and inhibits natural anticoagulant pathways and fibrinolytic activity, leading to DVT and PE [22]. In fact, the inflammatory process initiated by septic shock may be strained by coexisting tissue hypoxia and systemic inflammation leading to endothelial damages and DVT complications.",
