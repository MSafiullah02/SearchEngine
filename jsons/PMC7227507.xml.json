Discovery and development of new molecular entities [29] ultimately requires long and costly clinical trials to gain regulatory approval. The shortest route to potential treatments is the repurposing (repositioning) of existing approved drugs (both legend and OTC) for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis to SARS-CoV-2 or for treatment of COVID-19. The concept presented here is intended to rapidly reveal if any existing drugs have therapeutic potential (or those that could be contraindicated) in treating Covid-19. Drug \u201crepurposing\u201d in this article refers to the use of existing approved drugs for the treatment of a never-considered therapeutic indication - in this case, Covid-19. Just considering unique small-molecule drug entities, the universe of those already approved in the US - for multitudes of different medical conditions - might number several thousand [14]; the numbers of biologics and biosimilars expand this universe considerably [15].",

It is often guided by virtual screening methods such as computational approaches and bioinformatics to reveal possible druggable pathways (e.g., see: [27]; Pizzorno 2019) or even by traditional literature-mining and synthesis (e.g., [7]). But even these approaches often end up selecting potential drug candidates that eventually prove ineffective in subsequent clinical trials. And these approaches are seldom used for predicting drugs that would be contraindicated - in this case, those that could adversely interact with Covid-19 or with co-administered drugs. Computational approaches are also unable to easily identify multiple drugs that might be effective as combination therapies.",

An additional important point is that data mined by this approach during an epidemic could also have the potential to short-circuit imprudent decisions to investigate whether drugs rumored to be effective treatments actually have any potential. During the Covid-19 epidemic, one of the best examples was hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Rumors of effectiveness caused shortages for their approved critical therapeutic uses as anti-malarials and anti-rheumatics [33].",

Opportunities for natural experiments present themselves without active human intervention. Natural experiments can reside in an event where different subpopulations are suspected of experiencing a spectrum of exposures, ranging from none to extensive. The archetype example is the historic 1854 London cholera outbreak, where Dr. John Snow was able to identify the route of transmission and propose the solution for ending the epidemic.",

Many different scenarios can be hypothesized for how drug usage might be associated with Covid-19 clinical outcomes. Consider the two bookend case outcomes for Covid-19: (1) the vast majority that resolve with little to no morbidity and (2) the minority that become acutely serious. The most general hypothesis is that there are drugs (or combinations of drugs) that have protective effects and perhaps others that have adverse effects. To explain the lower incidence of serious Covid-19 outcomes compared with favorable outcomes, perhaps it is the drugs with the lowest overall clinical usage rates that could explain at least a portion of the serious outcomes - especially among clinical cases having no apparent underlying risk factors. It is likely that widespread Covid-19 testing among the general asymptomatic population will reveal that its infected subpopulation is even larger than currently believed for the subpopulation that progresses to serious outcomes. This would point even further to the possibility that perhaps it is the seldom-used drugs that play a role in serious outcomes.",

Initially, the only type of therapeutic drug usage data that would be straightforward to collect would be for drugs used in long-term maintenance therapies (both small-molecule and biologics); vaccines and hormonal agents should also be included. Therapy would needed to have begun several weeks before exposure but exposure dates would almost always have to be inferred. In contrast, drugs used in short-term therapy could be problematic to collect at first because many additional details would be needed: daily dose, duration of therapy, and time-frame of therapy. Many patients may be unable to supply this level of detail. Moreover, the fact that the short-term therapy might overlap with different intervals of the disease progression would make interpretation of collected data much more challenging.",

It might seem that drugs of obvious interest during data collection might be immunosuppressants or antivirals, especially those to be effective against enveloped viruses. But many other drug classes might also be important. A major advantage of NERD would be that the screening process is not guided by known or postulated pathways of exposure, infection, or disease progression, as NERD would essentially test all drugs for which usage data is collected. The importance of avoiding cognitive bias is shown by the evolving knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection, where a major route of infection is believed to be pulmonary (via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 - ACE2 - receptors), leading to severe respiratory inflammation. But ACE2 receptors not only populate alveolar epithelial cells, but also endothelial cells, which means that various organs and blood vessels are vulnerable to inflammatory damage and clotting [21].",

This distinction, however, does not matter for NERD, as all of these cases can be considered positive for infection. So the term \u201casymptomatic\u201d will be used here.(3)The DxUR for each group (and subgroups) would then be statistically compared with each other; alternative comparisons might be with the known rates of general population use of each legend drug, or the estimated population-wide use of each non-legend drug.(4)Potential drug candidates would be revealed by whether DxUR distributions are significantly skewed within the major case test groups (see \u201cOptions\u201d in Table 1). Normalized usage rates that have significant associations with a particular group may have potential for enhancing protection or therapeutic outcomes or, alternatively, the potential for increasing the risk for developing overt signs of infection or exacerbating clinical outcomes. The database would have to be coded to account for patients who receive multiple tests. Because of the natural heightened rate of mutation with RNA viruses, it would be prove important to constantly re-screen the same universe of existing drugs for therapeutic efficacy. This would occur automatically as the database is updated in real time.(5)Interpretation of NERD data and defining the Covid-19 test groups of most use to NERD. There are currently two general categories of tests for Covid-19: tests that indicate active infection and tests that primarily indicate past infection that has resolved. The former currently relies on RT-PCR or antigen testing, and the latter relies on serum testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; conceivable future tests would be those predicting vulnerability to disease progression. These two groups provide complementary information for clinical, epidemiological, and public health purposes. For NERD, however, the drug usage data collected from these two approaches would yield insights for the screening of drugs with a higher probability of success in repurposing.\n",

Important to recognize, however, is that NERD cannot be fully implemented until reliable (low rates of false-negative and false-positive), accurate, standardized, and inexpensive antibody testing becomes widely available in order to perform random serological surveys. Not until 1 April 2020 was the first Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a Covid-19 serological test (for use in clinical laboratories) issued by the US FDA (https://www.fda.gov/media/136622/download); unknown is when any serological test will receive full approval in the US, where validation for specificity and sensitivity are critical. Antibody testing would also have to assume that pre-immunity was not possible (e.g., from exposure to other coronaviruses). There are many unknowns and problems surrounding serologic tests for Covid-19 [10,20].",

In contrast, a negative test for active disease (without any other complementary test) would not be useful for NERD. This is because negative-test cases would aggregate two primary subgroups: (i) those who have never been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and (ii) those who were infected but who resolved the infection via a successful immune response (being asymptomatic or experiencing only mild infection). Both of these subgroups can be disaggregated only by IgM/IgG antibody testing (option #1 or #3); the course of the disease can transition from infection-positive to infection-negative after testing immune-positive. It is only this second negative-test subgroup (i.e., positive serum antibody test) that would be useful to NERD. Antibody tests provide additional opportunity for interpretation in NERD, as they would represent a portion of the population that was most successful in recovering from self-limited asymptomatic or mild infection. But antibody testing could also prove problematic for interpretation because the patient would need to know when they had probably become infected. If this is not known, then the patient may not know what drug usage they had experienced over the time period encompasses pre-exposure and infection.",

But this important aspect of Covid-19 is ignored in the concept of NERD developed here simply because there is no current way to easily determine exposure intensity. It is important to recognize that it is within the actual complexities of the disease, such as exposure intensity, that NERD attempts to reveal drugs that impact the disease.

In particular, the possibility exists for discovering whether such non-drug exposures increase the susceptibility or vulnerability to more serious Covid-19 outcomes. This might be especially germane to explaining cases of serious Covid-19 disease among healthy younger adults and reported gender and racial disparities.

The relatively new monitoring approach called wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been in use for identifying drugs that are collectively consumed across entire communities. One of the primary applications of WBE has been the monitoring of sewage for drugs (or their metabolites) and back-calculating per capita consumption [26]. WBE has also been used for monitoring the presence of pathogens such as viruses (to provide early warnings for emerging outbreaks) and more recently proposed for gauging community-wide overall health ( [2,4] or for gauging community-wide status and trends of infection [5]. WBE could therefore possibly be used to complement and verify the findings of NERD. For example, drugs found by NERD to be predominantly associated with asymptomatic or mild cases of Covid-19 could be targeted for WBE monitoring in communities suspected as having low infection rates; note that the overall rates of community infection could also be gauged by WBE (e.g., see: [18,32]). Conversely, drugs found to be predominantly associated with severe or critical cases of Covid-19 could be targeted for WBE monitoring in communities suspected as having high infection rates. Likewise, WBE could be used to quickly assess which communities may have high infection rates, and then target these communities for testing of asymptomatic individuals.",
