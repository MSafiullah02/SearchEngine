Methods: We utilized Medicaid Extract files from 27 states from 1999 to 2006 linked to the National Cystic Fibrosis Registry to establish a cohort of children 0-2 years with CF diagnosis. Eligible children entered the cohort after CF diagnosis and after RSV season onset, and were followed until season end, second birthday, death, or hospitalizations for reasons other then the study outcome. Two outcomes were examined: hospitalization for RSV infections (RSV-ha), or hospitalization for acute respiratory infections (ARI-ha). Palivizumab exposure was defined based on pharmacy or procedure claims as current (claim date plus 30 days), former (day 31-60 after a claim), and no exposure (days before the first or >60 days after any claim). Both outcomes were examined in a Cox regression model, adjusting for RSV risk factors and CF severity via exposure propensity score. Results: The matched cohort included 1,974 infants (2,875 infant seasons), who experienced 32 RSV-ha and 212 ARI-ha (3.9 and 26.2/1,000 season months, respectively). Compared to periods of no use, the adjusted hazard ratio for current use was 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-1.60) for RSV-related hospitalization and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.59-1.21) for ARI-related hospitalization. Each month of increasing age reduced the ARIha by 5.8%. Conclusion: RSV hospitalization incidence was low suggesting either little contribution of the virus to respiratory infections in patients with CF or lack of RSV testing. Unadjusted and adjusted RSV-hospitalization incidence rates suggested potentially positive effects of palivizumab, but results were inconclusive due to small event rates. Hospitalizations for acute respiratory illness with possible RSV contribution showed no association with palivizumab use, suggesting limited overall effect of palivizumab.

Based on the evidence on palivizumab efficacy from clinical trials 5, 6 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends routine prophylaxis for children with congenital heart disease (CHD), chronic lung disease, and certain preterm infants. 7 For patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a multisystem disease primarily affecting pulmonary function, RSV infection like other viral infections, is implicated in causing respiratory symptoms. 8 Similar to healthy infants, RSV appears to be the predominant viral infection in infants with CF, but limited epidemiologic data exist. 9, 10 Two cohort studies of newborns diagnosed with CF report hospitalizations for respiratory disease with RSV involvement in 7 out of 80 infants over 2 years of follow-up and 7 out of 48 infants over a mean of 28.8 months of follow-up (range 5-59), respectively. 10, 11 Furthermore, one cohort study that followed infants with CF less than 2 years of age for one RSV season found three cases of RSV hospitalization in 30 participants. 9 In comparison, annual RSV hospitalization incidence rates estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the general U.S. population range between 1.3 and 2.6% in children less than 1 year of age. 12, 13 Citing limited evidence for palivizumab efficacy in children with CF, the AAP as well as the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Vaccination Group make no recommendation for the use of palivizumab in infants with CF. 7, 14 The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in the United States recommends that immunoprophylaxis be considered but concurs in the recognition of lack of evidence. 15 Small CF prevalence imposes sample size challenges, resulting to our knowledge in only four controlled studies on palivizumab effectiveness. A systematic Cochrane review 16 detected one randomized controlled trial, which included 186 CF children from 40 centers in the USA who were randomized to receive palivizumab or placebo over five months of one RSV season. 17 Only one participant (1.1%) in each group was hospitalized due to RSV infection, leaving the study inconclusive. A retrospective cohort study evaluating 75 children with CF had similar challenges with sample size with RSV hospitalizations in 3 out of 35 palivizumab recipients and 7 out of 40 non-recipients. 18 Results of a survey ascertaining utilization pattern of palivizumab in CF reported that 14 out of 143 infants with CF received palivizumab across responding CF centers. 19 One of the palivizumab users versus 15 of the 129 non-users had been hospitalized due to RSV. Finally, one study 20 compared 91 CF infants receiving palivizumab in the Palivizumab Outcomes Registry with two historical cohorts. 10, 11 With none of the prophylaxed CF infants hospitalized as a result of RSV, the authors concluded that palivizumab has significantly reduced RSV-caused hospitalizations.

In addition, the use of low sensitivity RSV antigen tests in clinical practice, if not followed up with a high sensitivity viral screen, may also result in lower RSV incidence rates. It is plausible that the severity and clinical importance of bacterial infections in CF patients may have altered the perceived need for viral testing, resulting in the surprisingly low incidence of diagnosed RSV infections. A previous retrospective analysis 18 observed the absence of data regarding the contribution of RSV and other respiratory viruses in a medical records database of CF patients.

Thus, palivizumab users were sicker with respect to a greater propensity for respiratory problems, which, however, did not seem to be true for RSVhospitalizations, further supporting a potentially beneficial effect of immunoprophylaxis. This notwithstanding, it is important to note that palivizumab did not seem to have a noticeable effect on the occurrence of hospitalizations due to respiratory infections in young patients with CF as a whole, suggesting the contribution of RSV (whether diagnosed or not diagnosed) is either subtle or the effectiveness of palivizumab in reducing RSV infections is only moderate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Since immunoprophylaxis is targeted to prevent RSV-related hospitalizations, we did not consider less severe forms of RSV infections reported at the level of physician office or emergency department visits. While milder forms of RSV infections could improve the number of study endpoints, the propensity to test for RSV in ambulatory practice is even smaller, which would have resulted in an even less specific outcome measure. Furthermore, it is not known what impact less severe RSV infections have on lung health and CF progression and thus hospitalization-related outcomes were preferable. 24 Although our study did not show a significant reduction in RSV-related hospitalization, previous in-vitro studies 24 demonstrate that in normal healthy lungs, RSV could induce the production of chemokines such as IL-8 by the airway epithelial cells, that may in turn participate in the recruitment of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells known to aggravate pulmonary exacerbations. It should be noted that the lung epithelia in patients with CF are normal at birth and decline over time, which might support the notion that patients with CF in infancy have similar RSV risk than healthy children. 8 Conversely, it has been shown that RSV can serve as a coupling agent between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the lung epithelia suggesting a possible role for the increased risk of early acquisition of P. aeruginosa infections in early infancy. 25 Our study does have one additional important finding. We observed that with increasing age, there was a linear drop in the risk for ARI-related hospitalizations, similar to other epidemiologic reports of respiratory infections in infants and young children. 26 Even though CF progresses with increasing age, these effects are not noticeable during the first 2 years of age resulting in similar age-related infection profiles as found in healthy children.
