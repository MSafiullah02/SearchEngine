Proper personal protective gear does an acceptable job of preventing exposure and limiting spread.11 However, reports are flooding the media documenting that many institutions do not have enough personal protective gear to appropriately protect their staff and healthcare professionals, which changes the ethical dynamic. We must keep in mind that certain populations (such as those over 60 years of age), providers with underlying chronic conditions, and pregnant caregivers are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19.12 These clinicians represent vulnerable subsets among us who are risking more by caring for patients when they lack appropriate protective gear.",

For example, for a patient without active cardiac disease, whose hemoglobin is greater than 7g/dL, no blood transfusion is indicated whether we are trying to conserve resources or not. Guidelines that recommend not transfusing blood above this threshold are based on well-structured studies and show significant increase in morbidity and mortality when not followed.

In shared decision making, treatment plans are developed to which patients contribute their subjective values and goals and providers contribute their professional and scientific expertise.27 Hence, in shared decision making, only interventions for which the expected outcome aligns with the patient's personal values and preferences are implemented. However strongly an outcome may be desired by a patient, if that outcome is extremely unlikely to be achieved, we call that intervention medically nonbeneficial. As with observing guidelines of transfusion thresholds established as standards of care, and in order to abide by the ethical obligation of nonmaleficence, medically nonbeneficial treatments should not be offered to patients, whether we are in the midst of a pandemic or not.",

First, in line with standard of care, one must address the likely medical benefit of resuscitation to the patient and offer CPR only if the particular clinical scenario suggests a medically defined benefit. Second, providers should be required to perform CPR only if adequate protective equipment is available to them; however, if protective gear is available, then the duty to perform CPR should strictly be dictated by its likely medical benefit. Finally, the question of allocation of resources should be considered separately from the CPR question and should follow the algorithms outlined above for allocation of scarce nonfinite resources in general. When CPR is deemed to be medically nonbeneficial, this decision must be promptly communicated to the patient and the patient's family. Palliative measures should be offered without delay.",

Our triaging decisions should change in correspondence with the dynamic availability of scarce resources. As our social distancing eventually diminishes, our ability to honor individual patient preferences should inversely expand. Frequent reassessment of our methods of triage is therefore a must, and newly learned lessons from our caregivers on the front lines should be incorporated into our evolving methodology.",

Exponential population growth coupled with social interdependence and unlimited movements, along with our significantly increased longevity and access to life-prolonging technologies, have fundamentally redefined the limits of any one person's claims on our society's means. As providers, any intervention that we perform on a patient affects not just that patient but every other potential patient as well. It is no longer \u201cLive free or die\u201d; rather, it is \u201cLive free with consequences to the lives of others.\u201d As the pandemic rages and we struggle to keep up, perhaps we may find some instruction on how to care for our shared wealth of individual and societal health.",
