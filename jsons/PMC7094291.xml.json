Five antimicrobials are approved, labeled, and allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration to be used in medicated milk replacer for the control of bacteria; however, maximum effort should be made to avoid routine administration of antibiotics because of the risk of antimicrobial resistance (van den Bogaard and Stobberingh, 2000).

In this study, the hypothesis behind the microbiome investigation was that lesser secretion of water during an event of secretory diarrhea would lead to a more stable microbiome, possibly favoring beneficial bacteria that could lead to improved performance. During events of diarrhea triggered by E. coli, rotavirus, and coronavirus, the intestinal lumen can create a favorable environment for overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria (Tzipori et al., 1981, 1983; Kaske, 1993). The neonatal calf intestinal microbiota is dynamic during the first week of life, and different intestinal microbiota profiles can be associated with disease and weight gain (Uyeno et al., 2010; Oikonomou et al., 2013; Malmuthuge et al., 2015). In neonatal calves, the beneficial effects of decreasing diarrhea incidence and improving weight gain in calves have been reported when a higher prevalence of certain bacterial genera exists; namely Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Fecalibacterium (Abe et al., 1995; Foditsch et al., 2015). In the current study, fecal swabs were collected during treatment days for metagenomic sequencing, and no differences in relative abundance between treatment groups were detected for the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Fecalibacterium. Fecal swabs were also collected on d 20 and 25; a difference was observed on d 20 only for Bifidobacterium between treatment groups, where calves in the SB-300 group had a higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium than calves in the control group. However, by d 25, no differences were reported.",

Control calves suffered more from severe dehydration and had more intravenous fluid therapy interventions. No effects of treatment on average milk intake, calf starter intake, or ADG were observed. Besides a single increase in Bifidobacterium observed at d 20 for the SB-300 group, no differences in fecal microbiome profile were detected between treatment groups.
