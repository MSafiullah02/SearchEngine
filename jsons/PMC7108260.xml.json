Since the sensitive molecular methods for detection of viruses are more and more common, several recent studies highlight the clinical importance of respiratory viruses especially during exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or CF [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. In addition, viruses that were not previously sought are now detected, such as human rhinoviruses (HRVs) within the Picornaviridae family. Among the HRV genus, a new species of viruses named HRV-C has been described recently, is involved in severe respiratory infections in elderly and in immunocompromised patients [5], [10], [11], [12]. Furthermore, HRV-C has been described in patients with CF exacerbation but the real impact in the progression of the lung disease remains unclear [7].",

All patients had a well-documented diagnosis of CF with either the mutations identified in the CFTR gene or an abnormally high sweat chloride test. They were included by physicians according to the same criterion (an annual check-up or an exacerbation situation that required an expectorated sputum sample that allowed us to search also for bacterial and fungal microorganisms). Clinical data including spirometry, therapeutic, radiological and biological data were collected by clinic staff at each time of the visit. At each sampling time, the clinical status of the patients was defined as pulmonary exacerbation or stable period according to the physician defined requirement (i.e. recent changes in clinical parameters and/or modification of the pulmonary function provide criteria of exacerbation according to ERS statement) [13].",

A majority of patients (82%) were homozygous or heterozygous for the del-F508 mutation in the CFTR gene associated with an abnormally high sweat chloride test (median \u00b1 SD: 112 \u00b1 58.6 mmol/L). Our population was composed of patients with moderate CF disease, during a state of clinical stability (31 episodes) and during acute exacerbation (33 occurrences) according to ERS statement [13]. Most subjects had exocrine pancreatic dysfunction (88.4%), while diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance was observed in 37.2%, in agreement with published data [17]. All, but one (a 22 year-old woman), patients had microbial colonization in their sputa as determined by culturing. Colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was mainly detected (53.1%); Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans were observed in 45.3% and 68.7% of patients respectively, as previously published [1], [2], [17]. Regarding therapy management, most of the patients received rhDNAse (65.6%) and/or 70.5% inhaled steroids; 70.0% received low dose of azithromycin. Whereas oral antibiotic regimens remained the most often prescribed therapeutics (86.9%), intravenous regimens of antibiotics were prescribed in 75.0% of episodes. Antifungal drugs were prescribed for 11 (18.0%) of cases in agreement with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) diagnosis [18]. In 28 cases (45.9%), patients were under systemic steroids. None other systemic immunosuppressive therapy was used.",

Four HRV sequences were identified as belonging to HRV-A species, 4 to HRV-C species and 1 to HRV-B species. The 8 samples that were assigned to HRV-C or HRV-A species were characterized further by sequencing the 5\u2032UTR region (nucleotide position 178\u2013477; Fig. 2B). Using a bootstrap value of 70% or greater to define clades, topologies of the trees constructed from VP4/VP2 and 5\u2032UTR regions were in agreement with previous published results [19], [20], [21]. Surprisingly, the 4 sequences obtained classified as HRV-C by comparative analysis of VP4/VP2 sequences were related more closely to HRV-A strains when their 5\u2032UTR regions were analyzed. All query sequences grouped within the HRV-A clade, with bootstrap value of 90 and 84% (Figure 2), and belong to HRV-Ca variants, according to recent published data [19], [20], [21], [22].",

Our screening for respiratory viruses showed the presence of coronavirus in samples collected both from patients with exacerbation and from patients during stable disease. However, the presence of coronavirus in samples is not associated with the occurrence of an exacerbation, according to previous study [30], [31]. We detected influenza A virus in only one case, and therefore did not confirm the link between influenza infection and the occurrence of an exacerbation in CF previously described [29]. Due to the potential severity of influenza infection in CF, it is recommended to vaccinate patients against influenza viruses, but the patient positive to A/H1N1 detection did not follow this recommendation and was not vaccinated. The low influenza A virus detection frequency observed here might be linked to the good matching of the influenza vaccine to the circulating influenza viruses during our study period, even if the vaccination status of our CF patient cohort was not documented. Consistent with previous studies, we detected coronaviruses preferentially during the cooler months, HRV-A mainly in spring and autumn, and HRV-C variants preferentially during the autumn and winter months [15], [32], [33].",

Whereas the physiopathology of virus-induced exacerbation in CF remains unclear, we established a significant association between HRV detection and respiratory exacerbation, confirming the results of recent studies [7], [32], [33]. The detection of HRVs is more frequent in nasal swabs, especially in patients in a stable phase of CF [9]. However, our results show that the detection of HRV in sputum is associated with the occurrence of an exacerbation suggesting that the analysis of sputum could be more relevant than nasal swabs when a viral cause of pulmonary exacerbation is suspected. Some recent studies have shown that HRV-C are involved in severe respiratory infections especially during exacerbations of asthma [34], [35]. Numerous findings underscore the polymicrobial nature of respiratory tract as well as the importance of lung microbiota as a distinctive feature of tissue compartmentalization, but viral microbiota (or virome) has been poorly studied in respiratory tract [22], [36]. Respiratory virome appears composed of three major virus families: Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae or Picornaviridae for which a novel type of Rhinovirus C was identified [36].",

            "text": "Here, we performed sequence-based typing of 9 HRVs resulting in 1 HRV-B, 4 HRV-A, and 4 HRV-C. As previously described, HRV-A and HRV-C were the most frequently detected viruses compared to the frequency of HRV-B detection [37]. Recent studies have shown recombination between the 5\u2032UTR region of HRV-C genome and the coding region of HRV-A genome leading the authors to propose a new classification of HRVs in two subspecies, HRV-Ca and -Cc [15], [19], [20], [38]. Occurrence of such recombination was then confirmed, HRV-Ca and HRv-Cc being detected in various upper respiratory diseases [37]. Here, we identified all the HRV-C isolates as belonged to the sub-species HRV-Ca by sequencing both the VP4/VP2 and 5\u2032UTR regions. To our knowledge, the present study describes for the first time the presence of HRV-Ca subtype in patients with CF. Although the clinical significance of such recombination is still matter of debate, our results confirm the well-known recombination ability of enteroviruses (notably HRVs); a fact of particular relevance when phage community represents a key point in the lung microbiota analysis as well as in the improvement of resistosome concept [26], [35], [38], [39]. In Fact, human microbiota represents a huge reservoir of mobilizable genes, as proposed by Rolain and co-workers [39]; some of those genes encoding antimicrobial resistance that the authors named \u2018resistome\u2019 [39]. This concept is based on few metagenomic studies that have analyzed viral and bacterial communities in CF sputum samples, revealing the presence of an important bacteriophage community containing genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, and demonstrating these bacteriophages are consistent with the characteristics of multidrug-resistant microbial communities that are commonly observed in CF patients [26], [35], [38], [39].",
