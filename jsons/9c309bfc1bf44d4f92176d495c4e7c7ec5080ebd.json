In the article, Patel et al 3 cited the co-occurrence of 14 COVID-19 infected medical workers and a COVID-19 affected patient with pituitary adenoma who underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery in our department, and stated the safety issue about the transsphenoidal surgery in this emerging COVID-19 situation. However, what was described does not accord with the facts.",

It is not accurate. At the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, we had 1 patient who underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery on January 6, 2020 and was diagnosed with COVID-19 13 d later. Among the infected medical workers, 10 nurses and 4 neurosurgeons were diagnosed and only 4 nurses contacted the COVID-19 patient directly.",

However, according to our retrospective survey on our case, none of medical staff who participated in surgery were diagnosed with COVID-19 until March 31, 2020. Today, all the infected medical staff have recovered. More importantly, the medical workers diagnosed with COVID-19 in our department later were the staff who were outside the operation room. As for the infected neurosurgeon in our department, it's conceivable to be deemed as postoperative transmission rather than intraoperative transmission.",

So, compared to droplet transmission, contact transmission may be an important factor of transmission in medical workers which more likely we ignored at the early stage. Therefore, it is very important to wash hands and clean the surface of objects in wards and living areas. What's more, it is vital to make sure that once COVID-19 patients are confirmed, strict isolation measures must be taken as soon as possible.",

However, from our case, we have learned that intraoperative aspirator, protective clothing, N95 mask, and face shield can provide sufficient protection to our medical staff in the surgery room.

No convincing evidence exists to show that there is an increased possibility of infection from the endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery under the above protective measures. At this emerging COVID-19 situation and for patients' safety, our advice is to avoid selective endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery unless in an emergency case, in which situation level-3 protection is definitely needed and a negative pressure operating room is recommended.",
