            "text": "Approximately 71.8% of emerging infectious diseases have originated from wildlife (Jones et al., 2008). Bats have been involved in outbreaks of emerging diseases around the world and are known reservoirs of coronaviruses (CoVs) capable of crossing the host\u2013species barrier (Calisher et al., 2006). One example is the 2002\u20132003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV outbreak. After the subsequent finding that bats constitute this virus\u2019 natural reservoir (Lau et al., 2005), several research groups have detected \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010CoVs in a variety of bat species throughout the world (Drexler et al., 2014). Also the newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV depicts limited sequence similarities with CoVs found in bats (Annan et al., 2013). Around 33% of overall bat species and 75% of the known 113 bat genera are found in the neotropics (Osborne et al., 2011). Costa Rica exhibits an extraordinary bat diversity with more than 109 recorded species so far, representing 10% of the total bat diversity worldwide (Timm and LaVal, 2000). In this study, the diversity of bat coronaviruses in neotropical bats was assessed by analysing putative phylogenetic relationships with previously detected RdRp sequences around the world.",

Bats were sampled between 2012 and early 2014 at 11 distinct locations in Costa Rica (Fig. 1a) subjected to different levels of human intervention, that is minimal (site A Palo Verde 10\u00b021\u203214.2\u2033N 85\u00b019\u203245.7\u2033W, Site G Santa Rosa 10\u00b050\u203208.5\u2033N 85\u00b037\u203227.2\u2033W), agricultural/rural with patches of forest (site B Virgen del Socorro 10\u00b017\u203231.9\u2033N 84\u00b007\u203221.3\u2033W, site C Tirimbina Biological Station 10\u00b025\u203201.4\u2033N 84\u00b007\u203225.4\u2033W\u00b0, Site E Nandayure 10\u00b003\u203225.6\u2033N 85\u00b015\u203255.2\u2033W, Site F Sarapiqui 10\u00b024\u203211.0\u2033N 84\u00b008\u203201.6\u2033W, Site H Bolson 10\u00b021\u203205.6\u2033N 85\u00b025\u203205.8\u2033W, Site J Parrita 9\u00b0 32\u2032 26.0\u2033 N 84\u00b0 24\u2032 02.5\u2033 W) and urban (site D San Jos\u00e9 9\u00b056\u203219.3\u2033N 84\u00b002\u203242.8\u2033W, Site I Puntarenas 9\u00b0 58\u2032 39.4\u2033 N 84\u00b0 50\u2032 16.7\u2033 W, Site K Nicoya 10\u00b0 8\u203235.64\u2033N, 85\u00b026\u203247.33\u2033W). Bats were captured using three mist nets at a height of 2 metres (Platt et al., 2000) set at each location in open areas near drinking or feeding sites, to maximize capture success (Newman et al., 2011). Once captured, bats were collected and transported to the field laboratory. Bats were examined for signs of disease and taxonomically classified (Timm and LaVal, 2000). Anal swabs or faecal pellets for a total of 421 bats were collected and dissolved in 400 \u03bcl of RNA stabilizing reagent (RNAlater\u00ae, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and promptly transported at 4\u00b0C to the laboratory. TRIzol method (Invitrogen\u2122 Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for RNA extraction, and reverse transcription was conducted using a commercially available kit (Thermo Scientific RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, Waltham, MA, USA). CoV screening was performed by a previously described pancoronavirus RT\u2010PCR assay (Poon and Peiris, 2008). Sequencing reactions were prepared using Big Dye\u00ae Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit version 1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) and sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3130 Automated Capillary DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences derived during this study (n = 4) were aligned with 40 Bat CoV RdRp sequences from Genbank using Megalign software (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA) and then trimmed to a common length of 440 bp. Sequences in the data set where chosen based on length, region of the RdRp, geographical location, CoVs of significance for public health and CoV sequences derived from bats found in America. All duplicate sequences were removed. A Bayesian inference (BI) tree using Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain method was constructed using 4 million generations in MrBayes software version 3.2.1. under the general time reversible (GTR) substitution model and a discrete Gamma distributed with invariant sites (G+I) across\u2010site rate (5 categories). The best\u2010fit models for the tree was selected by a model test in MEGA6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013). To attempt coronavirus isolation, CoV RNA\u2010positive faecal samples were inoculated after debris and bacterial clarification in Desmodus rotundus embryo primary kidney\u2010, fibroblasts\u2010 and intestinal\u2010cell\u2010derived confluent monolayers. Briefly, low passage cells were seeded in 24\u2010well plates with D\u2010MEM 10% NCS and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere until 70% confluence. Cell culture medium was then removed, and cells were inoculated with Log10 diluted samples. After a 2\u2010hour virus adsorption period, D\u2010MEM 2% NCS was added. Cells were daily observed during 22 days to detect any changes in cell morphology (CPE). Cells and supernatants were analysed for CoVs presence by RT\u2010PCR at days 7, 14 and 21 post\u2010inoculation.",

The overall finding for the targeted RdRp sequence was approximately 1% (4 of 421 bats). Four bat species Artibeus jamaicensis, Carollia perspicillata, Carollia castanea and Glossophaga soricina were found to be CoV positive, but none showed any obvious signs of disease, consistent with other reports (Tang et al., 2006; Dominguez et al., 2007). The finding of CoV positivity in these species may be related to the fact that these bats are highly adaptable, resistant to habitat fragmentation and widespread throughout Costa Rica (Medell\u00edn et al., 2000; Timm and LaVal, 2000). Genera found previously positive such as Mollossus sp (Lima et al., 2013) were negative. This suggests that bat CoV prevalence might be low, although relative sampling for this species in this study was high.",

Our C. perspicillata CoV and C. castanea sequences (KC779225 and KM215147, respectively) clustered with previously published Carollia CoVs from Brazil, Costa Rica and Trinidad with 99% posterior probability. The sequence from C. perspicillata has 96.8\u201397.8% nucleotide sequence identity and shows 1 or 2 amino acid differences (98.6\u201399.3% amino acid sequence identity for the RdRp) with the Carollia sp. sequences described by Corman et al. (2013). The sequence of C. castanea CoV has a nucleotide sequence identity of 92.5\u201392.9% with the other Carollia sp. CoVs detected in the country by us and by Corman et al. (2013), which represents an amino acid identity of 98.6% with only two amino acid substitutions. This is the first detection of CoV in C. castanea so far reported. All Carollia sp. CoV sequences found to date cluster together in a genus\u2010specific monophyletic clade. The A. jamaicensis CoV sequence (KC779226) was most closely related to A. jamaicensis CoV II found in Panama by Corman et al. (2013) (JQ731784), having 97.3% nucleotide sequence identity and clustering together on a branch with 100% posterior probability. The observed nucleotide sequence difference translates into 4 amino acid substitutions resulting in an amino acid identity of 96.8%. Finding the same species of bats carrying similar CoVs even when geographically distant suggests for species specificity of bat CoVs (Corman et al., 2013). Therefore, these findings support the theory that CoVs coevolve with individual bat species or genera.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the G. soricina CoV RdRp sequence (KM215146) represents a divergent sequence. In fact, the highest homology (76% sequence identity) corresponds to an Australian Rhinolophus megaphyllus bat CoV (bat coronavirus R.meg/Australia/CoV100/2007 EU834953.1) and one found by us in a Costa Rican A. jamaicensis bat (KC779226). Its sequence identity to CoV sequences from the same species of bat [G. soricina in Trinidad EU769558 (Carrington et al., 2008)] is only 70% at the nucleotide level and 79.4% at the amino acid level. Posterior probability of 73% makes the placing of this bat CoV sequence in the phylogeny uncertain. Also, our G. soricina bat CoV sequence did not cluster near previously reported CoVs from the same species of bat in Trinidad (Carrington et al., 2008). Nonetheless, the detection of such a divergent sequence of CoV in G. soricina suggests that the diversity of bat CoVs in a given species may be greater than previously known. It is tempting to speculate that nectivorous bats could be more exposed to different CoVs because of their feeding habits (Corman et al., 2013). Additionally, G. soricina is known to roost with bats of eight different families (Alvarez et al., 1991), which presents a plausible scenario of virus exchange among different species.",

The phylogenetic analysis performed in the current study show that the derived bat CoVs are unrelated to coronaviruses from other animals or humans, suggesting that recent zoonotic spillover events have not occurred. For an accurate understanding of the events involving an emergence of a non\u2010described pathogen, for example a bat coronavirus, more profound ecological and taxonomical studies in their natural hosts have to be performed. These studies will support a more accurate surveillance and proper conservation management for these mammals. Moreover, because Latin America has been suggested as an emerging disease hotspot (Jones et al., 2008), more studies on these rich biodiversity countries are encouraged, as it might aid in the forecasting readiness of emerging infectious diseases.",
