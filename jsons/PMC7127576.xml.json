Answers in real time can direct agent-specific therapy and avoid overuse of precious broad-spectrum antibiotics. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and molecular tests, which have been developed for the past 20 years and have been coexisting with routine microbiology culture, have not been widely adopted, contributing little to rapid decision making for patient care, especially for bacteria, because many of them are laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), which are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared or commercially available. Urinary pathogen nonmolecular FDA-cleared diagnostic assays for S pneumonia and Legionella are an exception, because their results are rapidly available.10, 11\n",

It provides an overview of the FDA-cleared rapid nonmolecular tests compared with the new rapid molecular tests for the diagnosis of influenza, other respiratory viruses, and bacteria, with less emphasis on those molecular tests that are not FDA-cleared, because they offer clinicians less acute medical management tools, except in research studies.

Additionally, the nonmolecular assay, the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test using monoclonal antibodies on direct patient viral transport culture sediments, has been used for rapid identification of influenza and other viruses and is still popular. The molecular tests for influenza and viruses are used the most and are FDA-cleared and have been the subject of the most advancement in diagnoses, with the exception of several newer ones for Mycobacterium tuberculosis,19, 20 including the recently FDA-cleared FilmArray (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT) for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and B pertussis.21 There are many non-FDA cleared assays (LDTs), but their use has been mostly limited to research studies.22, 23 For actual use for the management of CAP, nonmolecular and molecular FDA-cleared assays are the ones most valuable for patient care.",

Another cell spot is stained with a monoclonal for hMPV. If the pool stains positive by fluorescent microscopy, the cell pellet is stained individually with each monoclonal to determine which virus is staining in the pool. This is a very efficient, rapid (\u223c2\u20134 hours), and cost-effective method to screen respiratory samples because about 90% are negative. The disadvantage is that a fluorescent microscope and a skilled microscopist are required. Sensitivity is approximately 80% to 85% and specificity is excellent in a skilled laboratory. An advantage is that all the negative samples can be screened in one pool with a single microscopic visual screen with the pool reagent. It is difficult to use as a POC test unless the laboratory is in very close proximity to the ED or clinic.",

It is FDA-cleared for nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal washes, or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. It requires roughly 8 to 10 hours processing and running the assay. There is a second-generation assay called RVP FAST (Luminex) only available in Europe (not FDA-cleared in the United States) that reduces the number of steps and the time to results by 3 to 4 hours. This assay is intended for use in only CLIA high-complexity laboratories. It has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific for respiratory viruses.31 It has been compared with the FilmArray respiratory panel.32\n",

This test was replaced by the automated Verigene Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acid TestSP, a CLIA moderately complex test microarray-based sample-to-result that is FDA-cleared for the identification of influenza A, influenza B (types A, Flu An H1, Flu A-2009 H1N1 Flu A-H3, and B inclusive) and RSV (A and B) from nasopharyngeal swab specimens placed in viral transport media. The Verigene System consists of two instruments (the fully automated Verigene Processor and the Verigene Reader) and single-use test cartridges, random access work flow. The entire test process only requires one user pipetting step, less than 5 minutes of technical hands-on time, and a sample-to-result turnaround time of about 2.5 hours. Test sensitivities and specificities for the detection of influenza A were 100% and 99.8%, respectively; for influenza B they were 100% and 99.1%, respectively; and for RSV they were 95.7% and 98.2%, respectively. This assay is CLIA moderate complexity, and a trained laboratory technician must perform the test. It is adequate for small- to medium-sized laboratories. Limitations of the assay include the single-test format that requires a dedicated processor for each sample for 3 to 3.5 hours.33 The H275Y mutation for oseltamivir resistance panel is only available outside the United States.",

After extraction of nucleic acid, a nested PCR reaction is performed within the pouch in an entirely closed system. The first-step PCR is a multiplexed reaction containing primers for all of the viral and bacterial targets; the amplicons from the first PCR are then diluted, and a second round of PCR reactions is performed in a multiwell array, each well containing a single primer set targeting a specific pathogen. Both amplification and melt curve analysis allow the FilmArray software to generate a result for each target.34 The system is very robust, detecting a low concentration of pathogen in the presence of a high concentration of a second pathogen, with results available in 1 hour. The respiratory panel detects 15 respiratory viruses and B pertussis, C pneumoniae, and M pneumoniae.

The evolution of the noncleared PCR assays and the challenges in the interpretation of these assays are discussed in an excellent review by Blaschke.23 Early assays targeted the pneumolysin gene, but showed rather poor sensitivity and specificity because of cross-reactivity with viridians streptococci.88 A comparison of several genes as targets for PCR indicted that the autolysis (lyt) gene was the most specific target.89 Sheppard and colleagues90 demonstrated the specificity of this target in clinical samples. Progress is being made with regard to distinguishing carriage or colonization from pneumonia by detecting the colonization density using real-time PCR.91\n",
