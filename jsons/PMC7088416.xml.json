These enzymes are activated either by the presence of double strand RNA or by single strand RNA with secondary structure, and catalyze the oligomerization of ATP into 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates. These, in turn, bind to and activate the latent ribonuclease L (RNase L), which degrades viral and cellular RNA and blocks protein synthesis. In line with this function, human OAS1 and its murine ortholog, Oas1b, modulate the susceptibility to viral infections (Lim et al. 2009; He et al. 2006; Hamano et al. 2005; Mashimo et al. 2002; Perelygin et al. 2002). In particular, variants in human OAS1 have been associated with West Nile Virus and SARS infection (Lim et al. 2009; He et al. 2006; Hamano et al. 2005), and with liver fibrosis progression in HCV infected individuals (Li et al. 2009).",

The A allele abrogates the production of OAS1 p46 isoform which displays high antiviral activity (Bonnevie-Nielsen et al. 2005) resulting in the production of the p48 and p52 isoforms (Fig. 1). Additionally, alternative splicing of OAS1 transcripts originates a p42 isoform which displays an alternative exon 5, and a p44 product deriving from skipping of exon 6 and inclusion of a downstream alternative exon (Fig. 1). A recent study indicated that the different protein products display variable activity in blocking Dengue virus replication via activation of RNase L (Lin et al. 2009).\n",

Interestingly, viral agents have been proposed to trigger or exacerbate both diseases. The association between OAS1 polymorphisms and T1D is still controversial, with discordant results obtained in different studies (Qu et al. 2009; Smyth et al. 2006; Tessier et al. 2006; Field et al. 2005). In the case of MS, OAS1 SNPs and haplotypes have been associated with both disease susceptibility and severity (Fedetz et al. 2006; O\u2019Brien et al. 2010). In particular, the A allele of rs10774671 (the splice-altering variant in exon 6), which originates protein isoforms with lower antiviral activity, was shown to confer both an increased risk to develop MS and a higher likelihood to have a more severe form of disease in a population from Ireland (O\u2019Brien et al. 2010). Conversely, a previous study in a Spanish cohort found no association between this variant and MS susceptibility, although the authors found a rare haplotype to be more common in patients versus controls (Fedetz et al. 2006).",

Our previous data (Fumagalli et al. 2010) suggest that some overlap may exist among genes subjected to virus-driven selective pressure and loci involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Population genetic analyses of candidate gene regions can be regarded as instrumental to the identification of selection targets and, consequently, of functional polymorphisms with an effect on phenotypic traits. Here we analysed two gene regions in OAS1 and verified that while the region carrying the functional splice-site altering variant is neutrally evolving, long-standing balancing selection has shaped nucleotide diversity in a gene portion encompassing the alternative exon 7. A case/control association analysis indicated that variants in this downstream region, but not the splice-site altering variant, are associated with susceptibility to MS in an Italian cohort.",

Estimate of the time to the most common ancestor (TMRCA) was obtained using a phylogeny-based approach implemented in NETWORK 4.5 using a mutation rate based on the number of fixed differences between chimpanzee and humans. An additional TMRCA estimate derived from application of a maximum-likelihood coalescent method implemented in GENETREE (Griffiths and Tavare 1995; Griffiths and Tavare 1994). The method assumes an infinite-site model without recombination; therefore, haplotypes and sites that violate these assumptions need to be removed: for the analysis of OAS1\nr2 we removed 1 variant. Again, the mutation rate \u03bc was obtained on the basis of the divergence between human and chimpanzee and under the assumption both that the species separation occurred 6 MY ago (Glazko and Nei 2003) and of a generation time of 25 years. The migration matrix was derived from previous estimated migration rates (Schaffner et al. 2005). Using this \u03bc and \u03b8 maximum likelihood (\u03b8\nML), we estimated the effective population size parameter (N\ne) which resulted equal to 22,838. With these assumptions, the coalescence time, scaled in 2N\ne units, was converted into years. For the coalescence process, 106 simulations were performed.",

D\nT tests the departure from neutrality by comparing \u03b8\nW and \u03c0 and positive values indicate an excess of intermediate frequency variants. Fu and Li\u2019s F* and D* are also based on SNP frequency spectra and differ from D\nT in that they also take into account whether mutations occur in external or internal branches of a genealogy. Since, population history, in addition to selective processes, is known to affect the SFS, the significance of neutrality tests was evaluated by performing coalescent simulations with population genetics models that incorporate demographic scenarios (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). As above, we also applied an empirical comparison by calculating the percentile rank of D\nT, F* and D* in the OAS1 regions relative to 5 kb reference windows. Neutrality tests for OAS1\nr2 region indicated departure from neutrality with significantly positive values for most statistics in CEU and EAS (Table 1). In line with these findings, D\nT, as well as Fu and Li\u2019s F* and D* calculated for OAS1\nr2 rank above the 95th percentile of the distribution of 5 kb reference windows in these two populations. Conversely, no departure from neutrality was observed for OAS1\nr1 (Table 1) with the exception of CEU where D\nT and F* were significantly high. Yet these values are calculated over a very small number of segregating sites (n = 4) and are likely due to LD with OAS1\nr2.",

Indeed, our data (Table 1) indicate that nucleotide diversity indexes are extremely high for OAS1\nr2 in CEU and EAS. Yet, polymorphism level also depends on local mutation rates; therefore, under neutral evolution, the amount of within- and between-species diversity is expected to be similar at all loci in the genome (Kimura 1983). The multi-locus HKA test was developed to verify this expectation (Wright and Charlesworth 2004). We applied a multi-locus MLHKA (maximum-likelihood HKA) test by comparing polymorphism and divergence levels at the OAS1\nr1 and OAS1\nr2 genomic regions with 16 NIEHS genes resequenced in YRI, CEU and EAS. As shown in Table 2, a significant excess of polymorphism compared to divergence is observed for CEU and EAS in OAS1\nr2, while no deviation from expectations is detectable at OAS1\nr1.\n",

We therefore analysed a population of 660 subjects suffering from MS and 503 sex-matched healthy controls (HC). All subjects were Italian of Caucasian origin and were genotyped for two SNPs: rs10774671 (located at the splice-acceptor site of exon 6) and rs11352835 (the A ins/del polymorphism in the alternative exon 7) (Fig. 1). This latter was selected because of its putative functional role and as a consequence of its location in the haplotype phylogeny. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2, rs11352835 is located on the basal branch of the haplotype network, suggesting that it may represent (or be in full LD with) the selection target. The two SNPs we selected for genotype analysis are in relatively tight LD (r\n2 = 0.87) and both complied to Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium in both cases and controls. We found the allele frequency of both SNPs to be significantly different in MS compared to HC (Table 3), but only rs11352835 withstood Bonferroni correction for multiple tests (Fisher\u2019s exact test, Bonferroni corrected p = 0.010, OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.072\u20131.513). Comparison of genotype frequencies in the MS and HC samples indicated no significant difference for rs10774671 (Table 3). Conversely, the genotype distribution of rs11352835 was significantly different in the two cohorts (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.030, Table 3). The odds ratio for a recessive model with the deleted allele predisposing to MS was 1.41 (95% CI 1.103\u20131.811, p = 0.0051). Haplotype analysis identified no significant association.\n",

This is likely even more true for immune response genes, which are more frequently engaged in alternative splicing events compared to other functional classes (Modrek et al. 2001). Several studies have addressed the evolutionary forces underlying the appearance and fate of alternatively spliced exons in inter-specific comparisons (Xing and Lee 2005; Lu et al. 2009a, b; Ke et al. 2008; Zhang and Chasin 2006; Plass and Eyras 2006; Chen and Chuang 2006; Ermakova et al. 2006). Conversely, fewer analyses have focused on the selective patterns shaping the intra-specific diversity of alternatively spliced genes. Here we selected for analysis the two gene regions in OAS1 that encompass alternatively spliced exons. As mentioned above, at least five transcripts originate from OAS1, one of these is genetically determined by the presence of a splice-acceptor variant and gives rise to protein products with different antiviral activity (Bonnevie-Nielsen et al. 2005; Lin et al. 2009). The splice-acceptor polymorphism has also been associated with altered susceptibility to viral infections (Lim et al. 2009), indicating this region as a possible selection target. Surprisingly, our resequencing analysis in three human populations showed that OAS1\nr1 is neutrally evolving, as all tests failed to reject the null hypothesis of selective neutrality. Low diversity indexes were observed for this region in YRI, but the MLHKA test revealed that polymorphism levels were not exceptionally low compared to inter-specific diversity; moreover, calculation of Fay and Wu\u2019s H (Fay and Wu 2000), which detects an excess of high-frequency derived alleles, in both OAS1\nr1 and OAS1\nr2 yielded results consistent with selective neutrality in YRI (not shown), suggesting that weak negative selection (as opposed to positive selection) may be acting on OAS1\nr1 in African populations.",

            "text": "Conversely, data herein indicate that the region encompassing the alternatively spliced exon 7 has been a target of long-standing balancing selection in Europeans and Asians. Inclusion of this exon in the OAS1 transcript originates a p44 isoform (Fig. 1) whose antiviral activity has been poorly characterized. A recent report indicated that, among all OAS1 isoforms, only p42 and p46 display strong antiviral activity against Dengue virus (Lin et al. 2009). The reason for the differential activity of OAS1 proteins is presently unknown, as all isoforms display the catalytic OAS domain (which is located at the N terminus). Our analysis indicated that an A insertion/deletion polymorphism (A/-, rs11352835) is located on the major branch that separates the two haplotype clades, indicating that this variant, or one in linkage to it, may represent the selection target in OAS1\nr2. The derived deleted allele determines a frame shift that is predicted to result in the inclusion of 22 additional amino acid residues compared to p44. Given the differential activity observed against Dengue virus for p42 and p44 (which only differ by 35 terminal amino acids) (Lin et al. 2009), it is tempting to speculate that similarly, such a minor change in sequence composition may alter the antiviral potential of OAS1. One interesting possibility is that the different composition of the C terminus affects the specificity of OAS1 against different viral species. An alternative explanation for our findings is that the selection target is accounted for by a regulatory variant/haplotype with a role in transcription modulation, as several expression QTLs for OAS1 have been identified in the gene region encompassing exon 7 (http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/).",

            "text": "Although further analyses will be required to identify the selection target in OAS1\nr2, our data provide evidence that a functional polymorphism is located within this region, as signatures of long-standing balancing selection are expected to extend over relatively short genomic regions (Charlesworth 2006). Thus, we reasoned that a susceptibility variant for MS might be located in this region, as well, possibly explaining the previous contrasting results obtained for the splice-acceptor SNP in different MS cohorts. Indeed, while a strong relationship was recently described between the G allele of rs10774671 and protection from MS in a population from Ireland (O\u2019Brien et al. 2010), a previous report in a Spanish sample revealed no such association, despite similar cohort sizes in the two studies (about 400 cases/controls) (Fedetz et al. 2006). Our results on an Italian sample indicated that the A allele of rs11352835, but not the splice-site variant, is significantly associated with protection from MS. Given that the two variants have very similar frequency in the Italian sample, the estimated power to detect association is also comparable, and reaches 78% assuming an OR of 1.27 and a sample size as the one we analysed. The relatively tight LD of the two SNPs (r\n2 = 0.87) suggests that association between rs10774671 and MS susceptibility is driven by rs11352835. Therefore, minor differences in the level of LD in cohorts with distinct geographic origin might account for the contrasting results previously observed for the splice-site polymorphism. In this respect, it is also worth mentioning that insufficient sample size is regarded as a major explanation for several inconsistent associations reported in the scientific literature. This consideration may apply to previous studies on the role of OAS1 in MS, which relied on relatively limited patient/control samples (Fedetz et al. 2006; O\u2019Brien et al. 2010). Here we genotyped larger MS/HC cohorts compared to previous studies; our data confirm that OAS1 represents an MS susceptibility gene, and refine the association signal to a variant different from, but in linkage with, the one previously described to associate with disease.",

Conversely, a new MS susceptibility variant was identified within or in proximity to the alternatively spliced exon 7, a region targeted by balancing selection. In line with previous reports (Grossman et al. 2010), our work demonstrates that population genetic approaches can be regarded as instrumental to the identification of selection targets and, consequently, of functional polymorphisms with an effect on phenotypic traits. This observation suggests that the ever-increasing availability of resequencing data, obviously including the 1000 Genomes Project (http://browser.1000genomes.org/), can be exploited to identify selection signatures at the genome-wide level and this information, in turn, may be used to prioritize variants to be typed in association analysis for complex diseases and traits.",
