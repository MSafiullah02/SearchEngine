However, probable person-to-person transmission in hospitals and among fam-ily members was also provided under detail epidemiological investigations. In person-to-person transmission, most primary-index cases were fatal with a high viral load in blood. Secondary cases were infected with the virus through the direct contact of the mucous membranes or fragile skin with blood or bloody secretions of the primary cases without effective personal protection. Several reports revealed that the viral strains isolated from the secondary cases were identical to the sequence of the virus isolated from the primary-index case by complete genomic sequencing (Yu et al. 2011; Bao et al. 2011) .

Thus, these persons have high opportunities of the close contact with blood and/or bloody secretions, suggesting that they may be high risk population for person-to-person transmission.

Taking account of these data, SFTSV is not likely to be transmitted among humans. No stockbreeding-and/or slaughteringassociated professional infections of SFTS have been reported (Gong et al. 2015) , although the transmission route is highly likely as in the case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.
