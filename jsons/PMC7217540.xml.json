To validate that power-law distributions are indeed due to criticality, one needs to perform other tests [4], including testing finite-size scaling relations [4,20] and performing collapse of temporal profiles [4,20,21]. However, these techniques cannot determine what mechanisms or conditions keep or pose the system in the critical regime or if/how the system may lose its criticality. Nevertheless, other approaches can be used to demonstrate mechanisms or conditions that can lead to criticality of biological systems [22] or mechanisms (especially in living systems) other than criticality that can lead to power-law distributions [23\u201329]. In particular, Friedman and Landsberg [22] considered a simplistic model for neuronal dynamics and introduced a mechanism through which the hierarchical structure of neuronal networks can generate power-law distributions even far from criticality. The importance of network structure underlying neuronal dynamics for the generation of power laws has been also reported in other studies [18,19].",

To do so, we consider a simplified model of neural dynamics on networks, and show that, for some scale-free networks, avalanche sizes obey power-law distributions even in subcritical dynamical regime. Moreover, in other cases in which the avalanche size distribution is a power law with exponential cut-off, we disclose what structural parameters determine the cut-off size and show that even in such cases it is possible to observe distributions that are approximately power law over several orders of magnitude. In addition to numerical evidence, we provide an analytical description of the phenomenon relying on techniques borrowed from the theory of percolation [30] and branching processes [31\u201333]. We believe that our findings may have important implications in understanding properties of dynamics on real-world networks that have heavy-tailed degree distributions [2,5,34\u201337].",

            "text": "As mentioned above, we consider a simplistic model of neural avalanches for which we can show lucidly the impact of the network structure. In our model, an avalanche starts with a single activated neuron and, at each time step, every one of the active neurons fires a signal that stimulates all of their neighbors. This stimulus activates with a probability p each neighbor that has not been already activated. The avalanche of activities continues until no new neuron can be activated. This model is identical to the so-called independent cascade model, often considered in the context of opinion spreading in social networks [38\u201340]. For neural dynamics, it is a more realistic version of the Friedman-Landsberg model (FLM) [22] as in our model each time a neuron receives a stimulus it has the chance to become activated while in the FLM the activation does not depend on the number of stimulations. In spite of its simplicity, our model captures the fast timescale behavior of integrate-and-fire models [41,42]. This fact follows from the simplifying assumptions that repetitive activation is neglected and the stimulations that activate a neuron (by increasing its potential to above its firing threshold) are set at random [19,22,43,44].",

This quantity depends on \u03c1s, the probability that following an edge of the network we reach an avalanche (cluster) with size s\n[30,49,50,56]. To calculate these quantities we will need to work with their generating functions defined as, respectively, H0(z)=\u2211s=1\u221e\u03c0szs and H1(z)=\u2211s=0\u221e\u03c1szs.

We use this fact to extend the governing equations that Newman derived for H0 and H1 in the absence of percolation [50] to our case; thus we get\n(3)H1(z)=zG1[1\u2212p+pH1(z)],\n(4)H0(z)=zG0[1\u2212p+pH1(z)].The first difference between our calculations and the method of Refs.

According to the asymptotic properties of generating functions [48,54,55], the first form gives a \u03c0s with a power-law tail and the second form results in a power law with exponential decay. In particular, for \u03bb~>3 and non-scale-free networks, \u03c0s=R1s\u22123/2 at the critical point (pc) and \u03c0s=R1s\u22123/2e\u2212s/s* in the noncritical phases; however, for 2<\u03bb~<3, \u03c0s=R2s\u2212[1+1/(\u03bb~\u22121)] at pc (see Supplemental Material [48] for the definitions obtained for R1 and R2\n[59]). For these cases, Refs. [51,52] reported the same results for the functional form of \u03c0s; however, the equations they used [instead of Eqs. (3) and (4)] underestimate the prefactors [48]. We also retrieve the result s*\u221d\u03b4\u22122 calculated previously for UNs (using another method [51]) and we discover that a similar relation also holds for DNs; furthermore, we find that the exponential decay factor s* is also controlled by the skewness of the degree distribution according to s*\u22482p2\u2329k\u232a\u2329k3\u232a\u03b42\u2329k2\u232a2 for UNs and s*\u22482p2\u2329k\u232a\u2329jk2\u232a\u03b42\u2329jk\u232a2 for DNs. This indicates that even for skewed non-scale-free networks it is possible that a power-law distribution of avalanche sizes, expanded for several orders of magnitudes (i.e., as long as s\u226as*), emerges.",

Then as we know that in the supercritical phase H1(1)<1, for z values close to 1 (or z\u22501\u2212w with w\u226a1) we can write\n(10)H1(z)=h~+\u03b5=1\u2212\u03b7+\u03b5,where h~,\u03b7<1 and \u03b5\u226a1. Thus, in the right-hand side of Eqs. (3) and (4),\n(11)1\u2212p+pH1(z)=1\u2212p\u03b7+p\u03b5\n(12)\u2250\u03b7\u00af+p\u03b5,where \u03b7\u00af=1\u2212p\u03b7=1\u2212p(1\u2212h~)=1\u2212p+ph~. Now, we can write\n(13)H1(z)=zG1(\u03b7\u00af+p\u03b5)\n(14)=zG1(\u03b7\u00af)+G1\u2032(\u03b7\u00af)p\u03b5+12G1\u2033(\u03b7\u00af)p2\u03b52+\u22ef.Therefore, according to Eqs. (10) and (14),\n(15)h~+\u03b5=z[a0+a1\u03b5+a2\u03b52+\u22ef],where a0=G1(\u03b7\u00af)=h~ [see Eqs. (3) and (10)], a1=G1\u2032(\u03b7\u00af)p, and a2=12G1\u2033(\u03b7\u00af)p2.

(3) and (12) according to the prescription described in Sec. S3.2.d of [48]. Figures 2(e) and 2(f) show that Eq. (22) performs well in describing the distribution of avalanches with finite (nonextensive) sizes in the supercritical regime of 2<\u03bb~<3. It is worth noting that, in the supercritical regime, extremely large avalanches do also exist; such avalanches have a size that scales linearly with the network size. Hence, in the thermodynamic limit where the network size N\u2192\u221e, their size also diverges. In finite networks, the effect of such avalanches on the distribution of avalanche sizes can be observed as a bump (in DNs) or a single point (in UNs) in the tail of the distribution. As the system moves further from the critical point this bump (or point in UNs) separates and moves away from the rest of the distribution [Figs. 2(a)\u20132(d)].\n",

This finding may help us to better explain the emergence of power-law neuronal avalanches with exponents different from 3/2 observed in experiments [64,65] and in realistic computational simulations [19]. Moreover, critical systems are known to have crucial advantages such as optimum information transmission, capacity, and stability [1,13,15\u201317] because of their power-law avalanches. Thus the existence of power laws in other dynamical regimes implies that some noncritical systems may benefit from similar advantages due to divergence of the mean values and scale invariance of their power-law distributions [13]. Furthermore, the emergence of such noncritical power laws introduces new challenges for accurate detection of criticality in experimental setups due to the finite size of the commonly used samples. In addition to the importance of these findings in the context of neuronal systems, the insights on percolation properties of networks that this Rapid Communication provides may find applications in topics such as network robustness [56,66], epidemic spreading [50,67,68], and stability of biological systems [69].",
