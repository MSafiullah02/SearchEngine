            "text": "The direct contact of the lung surface with the air exposes this organ to numerous environmental dangers and pathogens. Apart from the physical damage, evaporation of the surface and the underlying tissue or possible infections of the lung by various pathogens are the biggest problems. To prevent these complications, the surface of the lung alveoli is covered by a complex mixture of lipids and proteins with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) as the major lipid component [1]. This mixture, called pulmonary surfactant, is essential for the normal respiratory mechanism. Complications within this mechanism cause severe diseases like the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2] or even complete respiratory failure [3, 4]. Surfactant proteins (SP) considerably influence characteristics and stability of this lipid system. Accordingly, the extensive investigation of SPs is of great interest to develop new therapies against diseases or aftercare medication for operation or transplantation patients of respiratory medicine. Four SPs are known so far, which differ significantly in their characteristics. Surfactant proteins A and D are members of the C-type lectin family, which show immunological properties [5, 6]. SP-A and SP-D can interact with carbohydrates on the surface of different bacteria, protozoans, fungi, and viruses which leads to an accelerated immune defense and opsonization [7, 8]. In contrast to that, the small and very hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C are essential for the stability of lipid monolayers at air-fluid interfaces [9\u201311]. They can control the surface tension and fluidity of the layer and regulate the insertion of new lipids into an existing system. To achieve their full functionality, these proteins are modified highly posttranslationally [12, 13] and are able to interact with other surfactant proteins. For example, protein cooperation was demonstrated for SP-A and SP-B [14]. All four proteins were initially identified within pulmonary surfactant, but recently, they were also detected on the eye surface and in different tissues of the ocular system [15, 16].",

            "text": "By means of whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic sequence analysis, two additional potential SPs named SP-G [17] and SP-H [18] could be identified. Their amino acid sequences have an identity of 23 % and can be found in the UniProt database (accession codes Q6UW10 and P0C7M3) [19]. Their length of 78 amino acids for SP-G and 94 amino acids for SP-H is too short to show any similarity to the group of huge and hydrophilic SPs (SP-A, SP-D). Their sequence length indicates that SP-G and SP-H belong to the SP group of small and hydrophobic proteins (SP-B, SP-C), but they do not share any domains with the members of this group and the sequence identities are very low (about 10 %). Unfortunately, there was no further information about these proteins available prior to the presented studies. Their 3D structure was not known, no characterization of the proteins was done and their detailed localization or function was still completely undiscovered. With these few facts about the proteins, choosing the right experimental work for their further characterization is very difficult. Fortunately, computational chemistry methods like 3D structure modeling or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can help out in those situations. There are many studies reported in the literature where modeling and MD simulations led to new insights which could promote research and gave valuable suggestions for further experimental studies. MD simulations showed the detailed interaction of SP-B with different lipid species [20, 21] and demonstrated the orientation of SP-B in the vicinity of a lipid layer [22, 23]. For SP-C, the stability of the protein fold was shown [24] and an important role for the formation of bilayer reservoirs [25] was verified in silico. Furthermore, the cooperation of SP-B and SP-C in an MD simulation caused an increased fluidity of a membrane system [26] and was crucial for the preservation and formation of a stable lipid layer system on air-fluid surfaces [26, 27]. As a prerequisite for these protein-lipid simulations, the possibility to reproduce a protein-free monolayer system consisting of lung surfactant lipids in an MD simulation was also described in the literature [28]. Finally, the immunological activity of SP-D was also demonstrated by simulation studies investigating the binding affinity of different sugar moieties, including glycans presented on the surface of the influenza A virus [29, 30].",

For the protein-lipid simulations, a basic DPPC lipid layer system mimicking the lung surfactant was established. The findings obtained during the modeling and simulation process were used to design and support experimental studies, for example the generation of specific antibodies for SP-G and SP-H and the localization of both proteins in different tissues by immunohistochemical methods [31, 32].",

For this reason, comparative modeling was not possible and the protein sequences were sent to the ab initio folding server ROBETTA [33]. This computationally expensive method was able to produce protein structure models for SP-G and SP-H with promising overall quality. The stereochemical quality was evaluated by PROCHECK [34] after minor model optimizations with YASARA [35, 36]. PROSA II [37] was used to determine the quality of the entire protein fold based on the statistical analysis of well resolved protein X-ray structures. Furthermore, the model quality was assessed with ERRAT [38] and PROQ [39]. To check the stability of the protein models, 20 ns MD simulations were performed with YASARA and the YASARA2 force field [36]. For the simulation, each protein model was placed separately in a water box with a physiological NaCl concentration of 0.9 %. The final models were deposited at the Protein Model DataBase PMDB [40] for public download and received the PMDB id PM0078341 for SP-G and PM0079092 for SP-H. Additionally, these final models for SP-G and SP-H were extended by posttranslational modifications (PTMs), which were predicted by sequence-based prediction tools. Different statistic-based programs were used from the ExPASy bioinformatics resource portal [41]. The protein sequences were scanned for acetylation, N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation with N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and phosphorylation with NetAcet [42], NetNGlyc [43], NetOGlyc [44], YinOYang [45], and NetPhos [46], respectively. Furthermore, the possibility of palmitoyl chains bound to free cysteine side chains was checked by CSS-Palm [47]. Predicted modifications were added manually to the protein structure models, followed by an energy minimization in YASARA. The final modified protein models were deposited at the Protein Model DataBase PMDB [40] as well and received the PMDB id PM0078342 for SP-G and PM0079093 for SP-H.

            "text": "To simulate the SP-G and SP-H models in a natural environment, a basic DPPC lipid layer system was established. DPPC is the most abundant lipid in the pulmonary surfactant [48, 49] and for MD simulations described in the literature, DPPC-only lipid layers are often used to investigate different aspects of lung surfactant research [26, 50\u201352]. All simulations in this work were carried out with the GROMACS package version 4.5.4 [53, 54] and the united-atom G53a6 force field [55]. The standard parameter set of the force field for DPPC was slightly modified after Kukol [56] to produce a reliable lipid system. The initial bilayer consisting of 128 DPPC molecules per layer was built with the CELLmicrocosmos MembraneEditor 2.2 [57]. The bilayer was placed in the center of a simulation box and solvated with water (Fig. 1a). A simulation of 75 ns length indicated that the chosen lipid parameters and simulation settings are able to reproduce a stable lipid bilayer system. The MD simulation was performed with the Nos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat [58, 59] at 323 K and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat [60, 61] with semi-isotropic coupling and a reference pressure of 1 bar. The LINCS constraint algorithm [62, 63] was used to fix the stretching of all bonds, allowing a time step of 4 fs. Electrostatic interactions were calculated with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm [64, 65] as implemented in GROMACS with a cutoff at 1.2 nm, the van der Waals potential was switched off between 1.2 and 1.3 nm. The neighbor list was updated every five steps, energy and pressure dispersion correction was applied. The last 25 ns of the simulation were used to calculate area and volume per lipid, lateral diffusion coefficient and area compressibility. In order to estimate the simulation quality, these values were compared to literature data (area and volume per lipid [66], lateral diffusion coefficient [67], and area compressibility [66, 68]). The last snapshot of this 75 ns MD simulation was used to build the DPPC monolayer system. The membrane layer with the lipids 1\u2013128 was rotated by 180 degrees so that the polar lipid head groups were facing each other. Afterward, the layers were separated from each other generating space between the lipid head groups. Two systems were generated, one with lipid layers approx. 6.5 nm apart (hereafter referred to as \u201csmall system\u201d) and one with approx. 9.5 nm space between the DPPC layers (hereafter referred to as \u201cbig system\u201d). Both systems were placed in a simulation box with the lipid layers parallel to the x-y-plane. The z dimension of the box was set big enough to generate a 4\u20135 nm vacuum phase between the hydrophobic lipid tails due to the applied periodic boundary conditions. The space between the lipid head groups was filled with water molecules. A 25 ns MD simulation was performed to equilibrate the monolayer systems and check their stability. The compressibility of the systems in z direction was set to zero for these simulations to preserve the vacuum layer between the lipid tails. Apart from that, the simulation settings were identical to the bilayer calculations. The resulting monolayer systems were used to build the initial protein-lipid simulation layouts by placing the protein models in the water phase between the lipid head groups (Fig. 1b).\n",

For this purpose, the force field was further modified with parameters for the attached PTM residues, namely phosphorylated serine, threonine and tyrosine, palmitoylated cysteine, serine or threonine residues that are O-glycosylated with GlcNAc or GalNAc and N-glycosylated asparagine. The N-glycosylation residue consists of a pentasaccaride core with two GlcNAc and three mannose moieties (\u2212GlcNAc-GlcNAc-mannose-(mannose)2). The parameters for these residues were taken from original building blocks of the G53a6 force field (for example glucose or mannose building block) and combined with standard amino acid building blocks to describe the whole modified residue. Missing values for the connection between those parts were complemented manually with parameter sets also available from the original force field. A derivation of novel force field parameters was not necessary. In the case of the phosphorylated amino acids, parameters were taken from the G43a1p force field [69]. The equilibrated protein models were placed in arbitrary orientations in the water phase between the DPPC monolayers. This resulted in six different starting orientations per model, each system containing only one copy of the respective protein model. From these six starting orientations per model, four systems were built based on the \u201csmall system\u201d and two were based on the \u201cbig system\u201d. As a special feature, in one starting structure based on the \u201csmall system\u201d for each modified protein, the model was manually positioned in a way that the palmitoylated cysteine residues are interacting with the lipid layer. That is, for the SP-G model with PTMs the palmitoyl moiety of Cys76 is in contact with the DPPC 1\u2013128 layer and the palmitoylated Cys45 and Cys56 are already interacting with the DPPC 129\u2013256 layer for the modified SP-H model at simulation start. Hydrogens were added to all structures according to pH 7 with an automated routine implemented in YASARA [70]. All 24 starting orientations (simulation systems) were neutralized with counter ions (Na+/Cl\u2212) and submitted to a 250 ps equilibration run with NVT ensemble and the Berendsen thermostat at 323 K, followed by a 250 ps equilibration run with NPT ensemble and the Berendsen thermostat at 323 K and barostat at 1 bar. Afterward, a 50 ns production run was performed for all 24 orientations. The LINCS constraint algorithm [62, 63] was applied on all bonds involving hydrogens and the simulation time step was set to 2 fs. The Nos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat [58, 59] at 323 K and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat [60, 61] with semi-isotropic coupling and a reference pressure of 1 bar were used for temperature and pressure coupling. Similar to the monolayer equilibration MD, the compressibility in z dimension was set to zero to maintain the simulation box layout. Electrostatic interactions were calculated with a cutoff at 1.2 nm with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm [64, 65], the van der Waals potential was switched off between 1.2 and 1.3 nm. The neighbor list was updated every 10 steps and no dispersion correction was applied. Trajectories of the system were saved every 10 ps.",

The analysis of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the protein backbone atoms revealed that both protein models reach a stable conformation within a reasonable simulation time (Fig. 2a, black plot for SP-G, Fig. 2b, black plot for SP-H). The secondary structure element percentages of 47 % helix, 19 % sheet, and 34 % coil for SP-G and 50 % helix, 8 % sheet, and 42 % coil for SP-H remain unchanged during the simulation, which also indicates a stable protein fold. The protein models resulting from these simulations were completed by posttranslational modifications, which were determined by various statistic-based online prediction tools. For the manual attachment of the modifications, only predictions with high probability were considered and in the case of more than one predicted modifications for a position, only the modification with the highest probability was added to the protein model. According to Table 1a, two phosphorylations, three O-glycosylations with GlcNAc, one palmitoylation, and one N-glycosylation were added to the SP-G model. For the SP-H sequence, six phosphorylation sites, six O-glycosylations (two GlcNAc and four GalNAc) as well as two palmitoylations were predicted and attached to the protein model as stated in Table 1b. After the manual addition of the posttranslational modifications, the protein models were submitted to a 20 ns MD simulation in YASARA to check the influence of the attached modifications on the protein model stability in comparison to the unmodified models. Again, the RMSD values show a stable protein structure for SP-G (Fig. 2a, gray plot) and SP-H (Fig. 2b, gray plot), and no unfolding or major loss of secondary structure elements are visible.\n\n",

First protein-lipid interactions are visible after three ns of MD (Fig. 5a, gray plot) and increase quickly thereafter. Unfortunately, the interaction energy is not stable at the end of the simulation and may have been even stronger if the simulation had proceeded. The fact that the RMSD plot does not equilibrate after 50 ns (Fig. 5b, gray plot), reflects this as well. Conformational changes of the protein to adapt to the layer surface and optimize atomic interactions cause fluctuations in both graphs. However, the interaction energy of about -1800 kJ mol-1 at the end of the simulation with PTMs attached to the SP-G model is already significantly stronger than the energy observed for the best SP-G model simulation without PTMs. This low interaction energy is also apparent from the protein-lipid interaction site (Fig. 6b). Compared to the results of the unmodified SP-G model, the number of interacting amino acids is increased (nine instead of five, interactions of Gly2, Ser3, and Glu46 are not shown in Fig. 6b due to clarity reasons). Hydrogen bonds are the dominant interaction type and Lys31 alone is responsible for interactions to fatty acid carbonyl groups of three different lipids. However, only one modified residue (phosphorylated Ser17) is interacting with a lipid, all other PTMs are interacting with the water phase.",

In detail, especially the 27 N-terminal and nine C-terminal amino acids are in close contact with the lipid layer. Accordingly, the interaction energy plot shows a steady decrease following the very early first contact at two ns until reaching a plateau after 40 ns at circa \u22122300 kJ mol-1 (Fig. 5c, black plot). The protein model, meanwhile, is strikingly stable in this simulation. There are no major fluctuations of the RMSD plot later than 10 ns and the model can be denoted as equilibrated after 20 ns (Fig. 5d, black plot). The reason for the model stability could be the numerous interactions between amino acids and lipid head groups, which fix the protein on the lipid surface (Fig. 6c). Positively charged amino acid side chains form three of nine observed interactions (Arg2, Gln23, Glu27, Met88, and Leu89 are not shown in Fig. 6c due to clarity reasons) and serve as \u201canchors\u201d in the ester bond region of the lipid layer.",

In this case, the residues 32\u201351 also form numerous interactions. The first interaction energy between protein and lipids can be spotted after 16 ns (Fig. 5c, gray plot) and is quickly decreasing to a value comparable to the simulation without PTMs (-2300 kJ mol-1). Unfortunately, it is clearly not stable at the end of the calculation, but stronger than for all of the other five simulations with the SP-H model and PTMs. This instability is also reflected in the RMSD plot (Fig. 5d, gray plot), which shows significant fluctuations until the end of the simulation at 50 ns. The extension of this simulation until 100 ns showed a stable interaction energy at about \u22122300 kJ mol-1 and an equilibrated protein model with respect to the RMSD after 60 ns (data not shown). This indicates that there is nearly no difference in the best interaction energy between the SP-H model without and with PTMs. However, the strong positive side chain interactions observed in the protein-lipid interaction of the model without PTMs are absent for the model with PTMs (Fig. 6d). This is compensated by a significant increase of the interaction count from nine to 14 (interactions of Arg24, Trp28, Leu31, Thr42, Arg49, Glu50, glycosylated Ser39, and Ala94 are not shown in Fig. 6d due to clarity reasons).

Polar PTMs like phosphorylations or glycosylations enhance this effect. In contrast, these PTMs increase the fluctuation of their attached protein parts if they are oriented toward the water phase. The area per lipid was also monitored for all simulations, but there was no case where the binding of the protein model to the lipid layer introduced any significant change in the area per lipid plot. For all simulations, this value reaches approximately 0.54 nm2, with a fluctuation of about +/\u2212 0.02 nm2, which can be ascribed to the MD methodology.",

A typical feature of surfactant proteins is their ability to interact with lipids, as reported by previous studies especially for SP-B and SP-C [25, 26, 73, 74]. Correspondingly, the SP-G and SP-H models were simulated in the presence of a DPPC monolayer. This meets the current understanding of the pulmonary surfactant layout and DPPC as major lipid component of the pulmonary surfactant [48, 49] was already shown to adequately reproduce the surfactant system of the lung in simulations [26, 50\u201352]. Parameters and settings for MDs with similar systems were extensively studied in the literature and needed only minor adaptions for the PTMs attached to the protein models. All calculations were performed at a temperature of 323 K, which is above the phase transition temperature of DPPC at 314 K [75, 76]. This ensured that the lipid system was present in the biologically relevant fluid L\u03b1 state instead of the more ordered gel or subgel state of a lipid layer [77]. To estimate the influence of the higher temperature on the protein stability, MD simulations of all models were performed in a water box at 298 K. The calculations showed no significant changes in stability or structure of the protein models (data not shown). In contrast to other studies, the lipid layer system for this work was built from scratch to obtain a lipid layer patch with the appropriate dimensions for the protein sizes. Literature values for comparable systems were reproduced successfully.",

The literature suggests that longer simulations in the microsecond range may be required to observe protein mediated events like lipid layer folding or lipid vesicle fusion [26, 74]. Such long simulations would be computationally too expensive for the here used united atom approach. A method called coarse-grained simulations [78, 79] with reduced complexity developed especially for long-term simulations would be the technique of choice for future experiments. For this, knowledge about the 3D protein structure is very important and a required input, because currently the most commonly used MARTINI coarse grained force field is unable to model conformational changes of a protein [78, 80]. The simulation results of this work demonstrate the stability of the protein fold in most cases, even during the formation of interactions between protein and lipid layer. Therefore, the here performed calculations provide the requirements for coarse-grained simulations.",

This process was traceable by monitoring the protein-lipid interaction energy. In this way, it was possible to discriminate between different interaction scenarios and visualize the influence of polar amino acids and PTMs on the interaction strength. However, the here used energies calculated based on force field parameters can only give a rough estimation of in vivo energies, since the accuracy of force fields reproducing intermolecular (i.e., non-bonded) interaction energies is limited [81]. For more detailed insights, advanced computational chemistry techniques like semi-empirical [82] or QM/MM methods [83], or experimental studies like the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC [84]) would be advantageous. However, the fact that all 24 performed simulations showed a clear interaction between protein model and lipid layer strongly supports the hypothesis that SP-G and SP-H are indeed able to interact with lipids and may be capable of surface-regulatory features.",

            "text": "Although both proteins were annotated to the surfactant protein family due to bioinformatics prediction [17, 18], their actual family membership was questionable on the basis of the available data. The results of this work provide several indications that SP-G and SP-H are indeed surfactant proteins. Their high grade of modification is similar to the already known surfactant proteins. Apart from polar modifications like phosphorylations and glycosylations, they also show hydrophobic modifications. This could allow SP-G and SP-H to present an amphiphilic protein surface, as is typical for surfactant proteins [12, 13]. Previous attempts to produce specific antibodies for localization studies failed. However, with the here obtained knowledge about the 3D structure and modification pattern, it was possible to identify PTM-free protein surface regions. Their use as antigen peptides led to specific antibodies for SP-G and SP-H. The successful production of these antibodies on the one hand indicated a high reliability of the protein models and on the other hand allowed localization studies. Immunohistochemical staining showed that SP-G [31] and SP-H [32] are present in tissues of the human lung and eye, mostly membrane associated. These are tissues where the already known surfactant proteins are also present and play a crucial role [5\u201311, 15, 16]. Furthermore, the antibodies allowed first functional studies, which showed that inflammatory cytokines could influence the SP-H expression [32]. This could indicate an immunoregulatory function of SP-H comparable to SP-A and SP-D [5, 6]. Finally, the simulations showed the potential of SP-G and SP-H to interact with lipid systems as described for SP-B and SP-C [9\u201311]. Altogether, these points strongly support the hypothesis that SP-G and SP-H are indeed part of the surfactant protein family.",
