Meanwhile, an economic crisis and resistance to the strict intervention measures are rising. Some researchers proposed intermittent social distancing that may drive the outbreak of Covid-19 into 2022. Questions arise about whether we should maintain or relax quarantine measures. We developed novel artificial intelligence and causal inference integrated methods for real-time prediction and control of nonlinear epidemic systems. We estimated that the peak time of the Covid-19 in the US would be April 24, 2020 and its outbreak in the US will be over by the end of July and reach 1,551,901 cases. We evaluated the impact of relaxing the current interventions for reopening economy on the spread of Covid-19. We provide tools for balancing the risks of workers and reopening economy.",

However, public health interventions have restricted economic activities and caused high unemployment. Some investigators who published their mathematical projection of the dynamics of Covid-19 in Science suggested \"prolonged or intermittent social distancing\" which may drive the outbreak of Covid-19 into 2022 (1) . Meanwhile, MIT researchers questioned the \"intermittent social distancing\" policy and worried that relaxing public interventions may cause an exponential explosion of Covid-19 (2) . Now it is a critical decision point as to whether public health intervention measures should remain in place or should be lifted for reopening economy. Can we simultaneously improve both public health and economy? A key to correctly answering this question is to reconstruct the complex epidemic dynamic systems from the data, precisely predict the extent or duration of COVID-19, and develop a causal inference framework for devising practical implementable public health interventions to control the spread of Covid-19 in the US.",

Although these epidemiological models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission, and evaluating the impact of intervention strategies, they have some critical limitations (7, 8) . First, the SEIR models assume a homogeneous population which is evenly mixed. Second, the epidemiological models consist of ordinary differential equations that have many unknown parameters. These parameters are not identified (9) , which leads to low accuracy and a wide range of predictions. Third, most models assume that some control parameters are constant and are not time varying and system dependent. This will dramatically limit our ability to simulate interventions and improve prediction accuracy.",

A value of 1 for intervention indicates that intervention is the strongest and reproducing number R is close to zero. A value of zero for intervention variables indicates that no restrictions on social-economic activities are imposed. We assume that the time varying intervention variable is system dependent and can be automatically adjusted. As shown in Figure S1 , the IAE determines the intervention response (similar to counterfactual outputs) for a set of time varying and system adjusted interventions and evaluates the impact of different intervention strategies and their implementation times on curbing the spread of Covid-19 and provides timely selection of an optimal sequence of intervention strategies to balance public health and economy reopening.",

Figure 3 showed that the intervention curve started with a low intervention measure and then the trend of the intervention curve was, in general, increased until the end of February, 2020, when Spring break began. Spring break substantially reduced prevention measures and caused a large-scale outbreak of Covid-19 in the US. Then, the government implemented strict quarantine and social distance policies, and hence the intervention measure increased again. The average intervention measure of the US, 50 states and 5 other regions at the peak time was 0.54 (Table 1 and table S4 ). In other words, when the intervention measure was close to 0.5, interventions were sufficiently strong to decrease the number of new cases of Covid-19. Finally, the intervention measure steadily and quickly increased to 1 when the number of new cases rapidly deceased and the spread of Covid-19 was completely stopped. Figure 3 also showed that even if the intervention measure was assumed to decrease 40%, the intervention measure could still quickly and steadily increase to 1 and then the spread of Covid-19 would stop.

We used counterfactual outcome as a general framework for modeling health intervention plan and making multi-step prediction of the response trajectory of Covid-19 over time with a sequence of public health interventions. As illustration, we evaluated four scenarios of interventions and predicted that if we relaxed 40% of intervention measure, the spread of Covid-19 would be over on August 7, with 1,869,185 cumulative cases (increased 317,284 cases or 20.4% of cumulative cases than following the current intervention measure) of Covid-19 in US. However, if we increased 20% of the intervention measure, for example, by increasing the ratio of coronavirus tests, the spread of Covid-19 would be over on July 23, with 1, 296,487 cumulative cases (reduced 16.5% of cumulative cases than following the current intervention measure).",

First issue is low forecasting accuracy of the classical epidemiological models due to the unidentifiability of the model parameters. The classical epidemiological models often give a wide range of predictions of the future trajectories of the epidemics, which causes difficulties for public health intervention planning. As an alternative to epidemiologic mode, we developed data driven IAE for real-time prediction and control of nonlinear time-varying epidemic dynamic systems. The prediction accuracy of the IAE was very high. The 10-step forecasting error of IAE was 0.0012. Second issue is how to formulate the real-time forecasting and designing intervention strategies for controlling the spread of Covid-19 as a causal inference problem. The data collected for Covid-19 are observational data. It is infeasible to collect the transmission dynamics data from the experiments. These data for both the total US and individual state can be observed only once. Dynamic responses of epidemics under multiple intervention scenarios are counterfactual.

Question is how many number of tests is needed to ensure the curbing the spread of Covid-19 without intriguing the second wave of the outbreak. The IAE model with the ratio of the test as input provides tools for evaluating a sequence of strategies for safely reopening the economy.
