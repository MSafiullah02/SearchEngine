            "text": "Influenza infections occur in seasonal outbreaks during the winter period related to cold or humid weather conditions and are associated with an excess hospitalization and an increase in overall mortality [1, 9]. Due to a lack of accurate diagnostic tools in the past the cause of death might often have been inaccurate and the influenza-associated mortality underestimated [1, 2, 8]. While studies show pneumonia and influenza excess mortality during influenza seasons, the all-cause mortality in the same period is also 3.8 times higher [1]. High virulence and insufficient vaccination response result in up to 109 cases of influenza virus infections yearly [3\u20135]. Until recently laboratory tests for influenza diagnosis have been reserved for monitoring epidemics and clinical trials. This lack of confirmation renders the diagnosis relying on clinical parameters often inaccurate since the manifestations of influenza may vary greatly depending on patient characteristics, especially age and comorbidities [2, 6]. Particularly in high-risk hospitalized patients the diagnosis may be missed due to exacerbation of symptoms of pre-existing diseases or atypical presentation bearing the risk of inadequate treatment [7\u20139].",

This ensures correct management of influenza virus infections including prompt initiation of antiviral treatment, preventing onward transmission and avoiding overuse of antibiotics [16\u201320].

The department consists of 2 wards with 28 beds each and an intensive care unit with 10 beds. The hospital has an isolation policy for influenza positive patients. Patients presenting at the emergency department with influenza-like illness undergo POCT for influenza virus infections with the AlereTM i Influenza A & B assay (Alere, Waltham, MA, USA) performed by trained professionals. The AlereTM i Influenza A & B assay uses rapid nucleic acid amplification and was chosen as it produces reliable results within 15 min [12\u201315]. The time until the test result is available is an essential factor in this organizational setting. Influenza virus positive patients who needed in-patient treatment were transferred directly to the isolation ward. Whether a patient had to be admitted to this ward or could be treated on an outpatient basis had to be decided by the physician at the emergency department. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Approval number EK 18-106-VK) and due to the retrospective nature of this study informed consent was not necessary.",

Patients with influenza A tended to be younger and were more likely to have dyspnea and higher fever. Patients with influenza B had atypical presentations more often including vomiting and a partial absence of respiratory symptoms, which are classically associated with influenza. Mortality rates tended to be numerically higher in influenza A versus B. In previous studies comparing demographic attributes of patients with influenza A and B, a higher age for patients with influenza A was described although this may vary according to influenza A strains. Patients with H3N2 were shown to be older than influenza B patients while patients with H1N1 tended to be younger than patients with influenza B [21\u201323]. A French study by Chagvardieff et al. analyzed patients presenting at an emergency department and similarly to the present results influenza B patients were significantly older [24]. The age difference therefore seems to depend on the study population as well as the dominant influenza A subtype. Unfortunately, no information was available about influenza subtypes in the current population; however, during the season concerned influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B/Yamagata were the dominant subtypes in Austria [25]. It has been shown that patients with influenza A suffered more often from chronic diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders [22, 27]. Furthermore, patients with influenza A were more likely to be smokers. In patients suffering from influenza B infections chronic kidney disease was more frequent. A non-statistically significant trend towards a higher proportion of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease in the history of patients with influenza B was observed in this study population, which could be explained by the higher mean age of this group. In this population influenza A patients presented with a higher body temperature and with dyspnea statistically more often. Influenza B infections were associated with vomiting. A Japanese study with adults who consulted a medical center with influenza infections combined gastrointestinal symptom (e.g. nausea, diarrhea, epigastric pain) with one parameter and showed that they are more common in influenza B. Matching the present findings they also showed a higher body temperature in influenza A infected patients [26]. Other studies with a younger population and outpatient treatment did not show any differences in clinical presentation [21, 23].",

In this study the rate of ICU admission and respiratory failure was higher in influenza A but this did not reach statistical significance. Pneumonia was the most common complication (24%) and equal in both groups. There was a trend towards a higher proportion of acute kidney injury in the influenza B group, which probably could be attributed to the higher age, higher amount of chronic kidney disease and vomiting as a common symptom in this population. Despite the fact that the influenza A patients were younger, they had a longer median in-hospital stay (8 days vs. 7 days). This might reflect the fact that patients with influenza A were sicker and had a prolonged recovery.",

Of the studies one analyzed community and healthcare-acquired influenza infections and described an in-hospital mortality rate of 10%. The reason for this discrepancy is not known but may be due to the dominance of H3N2, which caused approximately 60% of the influenza infections in this study [33]. In the present population influenza B accounted for 75% of the infections and most of the influenza A infections were most likely caused by H1N1 [25]. In this study the 90-day mortality increased further to 9.4% with no difference between influenza A and influenza B, which represented a twofold increase in mortality. This was not surprising as there is an increased risk for complications leading to death after influenza infections as previously described [29].",

Almost 75% were infected with influenza B therefore the results may not be generalized to influenza A dominant seasons. The study did not differentiate between H1N1 and H3N2 and analyzed the two strains as one group. The symptoms on admission were not collected via a standardized questionnaire which may explain why mild common influenza-like symptoms, such as sore throat and coryza were underreported, especially in patients presenting with severe symptoms, such as dyspnea to the emergency department.
