Caliciviruses have a T=3 icosahedral capsid assembled with 90 dimers of VP1 which is composed of three domains; the N-terminal arm (NTA), the S (shell) and the P (protruding) domains (Ng and Parra, 2010, Prasad et al., 1999). The P domain of VP1 forms the spike on the virion and is composed of P1 and P2 subdomains. The P2 subdomain is located within the P1 subdomain and contains a conserved region flanked by the hypervariable domains (Prasad et al., 1999). The hypervariable domains are mostly involved in receptor binding (Bhella et al., 2008, Bhella and Goodfellow, 2011, Chen et al., 2006). The function of VP2, a minor structural protein, is not well known but it was reported that VP2 is required for the production of infectious feline calicivirus (FCV) (Sosnovtsev et al., 2005), interacts with VP1 to increase stability of norovirus capsid and is likely to be associated with packaging of RNA genome (Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2003, Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2002.",

Noroviruses and sapoviruses cause enteric infections in humans and animals (Green et al., 2001). Lagoviruses and vesiviruses mainly cause oral, respiratory and sometimes systemic infections in animals (Green et al., 2001). Noroviruses account for about 58% of foodborne human illnesses causing about 21 million cases of gastroenteritis and 800 deaths annually in the United States alone (http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/overview.html). Despite the importance of norovirus in public health, research on understanding norovirus biology and development of antiviral drugs has been greatly hindered due to the inability to grow human noroviruses in cell culture. Therefore, easily cultivable murine norovirus (MNV) (Wobus et al., 2004) and FCV (Luttermann and Meyers, 2010), in the family Caliciviridae, have been used as surrogate viruses for studying noroviruses.",

Virus uncoating may occur at the plasma membrane for direct penetration, or at the endosomes or other cellular compartments (Marsh and Helenius, 2006). Viruses utilize a number of different entry processes, including clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway, clathrin-independent endocytic pathway that involves caveolar or lipid, or other yet poorly defined entry pathways (Mercer et al., 2010). In clathrin-dependent endocytosis, viruses taken up by clathrin-coated vesicles travel through the endocytic compartments from where virus must escape before the increasingly harsher environment of maturing endosomes irreversibly degrade viruses. The journey of viruses following virus uptake to virus uncoating and genome release is less well understood for viruses that utilize clathrin-independent endocytosis (Grove and Marsh, 2011, Marsh and Helenius, 2006). However, there are reports that subsequent sorting of endosomal cargo such as viruses in different endocytic pathways may overlap in the early or late endosomes (Naslavsky et al., 2004, Sharma et al., 2003).",

            "text": "In the endosomal compartments, host enzymes including cathepsins are reported to be involved in virus fusion and/or uncoating of virus capsid for some viruses (Grove and Marsh, 2011). The cathepsin family of proteolytic enzymes contains several diverse classes of proteases including cysteine (cathepsins B, L, H, K, S, and O), aspartyl (cathepsin D and E) and serine (cathepsin G) proteases (Vasiljeva et al., 2007). Among them, cathepsin L, B, or S have been reported to be associated with entry and replication of some viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, reovirus and Ebola virus (Bosch et al., 2008, Brecher et al., 2012, Ebert et al., 2002, Mainou and Dermody, 2012, Qiu et al., 2006, Schornberg et al., 2006). Cathepsin L and B are shown to cleave Ebola virus glycoprotein, leading to exposure of putative fusion domain required for fusion of viral and endosomal membranes (Schornberg et al., 2006). Cathepsin L is also reported to cleave the spike protein of SARS coronavirus for fusion competence (Bosch et al., 2008). In addition to the enveloped viruses that require cathepsin for virus fusion and uncoating, some non-enveloped viruses are also shown to rely on host cell proteases residing in the endosomes for uncoating of virus capsid. Reovirus disassembly in the endosomes is reported to be mediated predominantly by cathepsin L and less efficiently by cathepsin B, generating infectious subvirion particles that are capable of penetrating membranes and deliver core particles into cytoplasm (Ebert et al., 2002, Mainou and Dermody, 2012). Virus entry mechanisms for caliciviruses including MNV-1, and porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC) or human norovirus are not well understood to date, although it has been shown that clathrin-dependent endocytosis and pH-dependent entry is important in FCV replication (Kreutz and Seal, 1995, Stuart and Brown, 2006). For MNV-1, it was reported that MNV-1 entry is not mediated by clathrin or caveolae, but dependent on dynamin and cholesterol (Gerondopoulos et al., 2010, Perry et al., 2009, Perry and Wobus, 2010), but detailed entry mechanism still needs further elucidation.",

The PEC levels in absence of bile acid and MNV-1 levels in cyclohexamide-treated cells indicate the levels of internalized viruses (Fig. 1A and B).

However, no statistically significant inhibitory effect was observed when chloroquine was added during the later phase of virus replication cycle (at 6 h PI) (Fig. 2A). Similar inhibitory effect of chloroquine was observed for MNV-1: a 1334.9-fold reduction in viral load was observed when chloroquine 70 \u00b5M was present continuously in the media, but chloroquine 50 \u00b5M did not significantly reduce MNV-1 replication (Fig. 2C).

The Western blot analysis on the samples incubated with cathepsin L or B showed that neither enzyme cleaved PEC VP1 (Fig. 3). However, a band that corresponds to a full length PEC VP2 (18 kDa) disappeared only in the samples incubated with cathepsin L, suggesting cleavage by the protease (Fig. 3). For MNV-1 and FCV, incubation of virus and cathepsin L produced multiple bands in the Western blot analysis: antibodies against FCV VP1 detected multiple fragments of approximately 59 kDa (corresponding to a full length VP1), 36 kDa, 34 kDa and 23 kDa (Fig. 4), and antibodies against MNV-1 VP1 detected two bands of approximately 59 kDa (corresponding to a full length VP1) and 40 kDa (Fig. 4). However, cathepsin B did not cleave FCV and MNV-1 VP1 (Fig. 4). Cleavage of virus proteins was prevented by the presence of cathepsin L inhibitors (Z-FY-CHO or MDL 28170) in the cathepsin L cleavage assay (data not shown). FCV and MNV-1 VP2 cleavage by cathepsin L or B was not studied due to unavailability of antibodies against VP2 of FCV or MNV-1.",

            "text": "PEC replication in cell culture is dependent on the presence of bile acids in the media (Chang et al., 2005, Chang et al., 2004). However, the mechanism of bile acid-supported PEC replication has not been understood. In our recent report, we demonstrated that the absence of bile acids (GCDCA) in cell culture or inhibition of endosomal acidification by chloroquine led to accumulation of PEC in the endosomes, while PEC disappeared from the endosomes within 1 h of virus infection in bile acid-supplemented cell culture (Shivanna et al., 2014). These results suggest that PEC failed to escape from the endosomes in the absence of bile acids or when endosomal maturation is inhibited. In this study, we observed the similar phenomenon with cathepsin L inhibitor treatment of the cells, indicated by colocalization of fluorescently labeled antibodies against PEC with Rab7, (Fig. 5). Rab7 is a GTPase of a low molecular weight and mainly localized in the late endosomes/lysosomes in mammalian cells, although it is also associated with the early endosomes (Chavrier et al., 1990, Soldati et al., 1995). The confocal images of PEC in cell culture in the absence or presence of bile acids and chloroquine were included as a reference in Fig. 5 (Shivanna et al., 2014). The cells infected with PEC in the presence of GCDCA showed no or little fluorescence staining of PEC VP1 at 1 h PI, while relatively abundant fluorescence for PEC VP1 was detected in the cells infected by PEC without GCDCA and in the cells treated with chloroquine or a cathepsin L inhibitor Z-FY-CHO (Fig. 5). Confocal microscopic analysis using MNV-1 also revealed similar results to those shown with PEC infection. In RAW267.4 cells, no or little MNV-1 were stained in the cytoplasm at 1 h PI (\nFig. 6). However, in the presence of Z-FY-CHO or chloroquine, MNV-1 VP1 was detected at high abundance in the endosomes at 1 h PI (Fig. 6), a similar observation made in PEC-infected cells (Fig. 5). These results suggest that MNV-1, as well as PEC, failed to escape from the endosomes in the presence of a cathepsin L inhibitor or chloroquine. For quantitative statistical colocalization analysis, single channel images were auto thresholded by Costes\u05f3 auto threshold method and Mander\u05f3s split correlation coefficients and Pearson\u05f3s correlation coefficients for the endosomal marker Rab7 and MNV-1 or PEC were calculated to quantify the degree of colocalization of viral proteins with Rab7 for all fluorescence confocal microscopy images. The calculated Mander\u05f3s split correlation coefficients and Pearson\u05f3s correlation coefficients were higher than 0.90 for all analyzed images.",

In the limited number of studies available on the entry process of caliciviruses, FCV entry has been relatively well known, but the studies on the entry of other caliciviruses such as human norovirus, PEC or MNV-1 have been limited (Kreutz and Seal, 1995, Perry et al., 2009, Perry and Wobus, 2010, Shivanna et al., 2014, Stuart and Brown, 2006). In this study, we demonstrated that cathepsin L plays an important role in the replication of PEC, FCV and MNV-1 by showing that inhibition of cathepsin L, but not cathepsin B, led to a significant reduction in the replication of PEC, FCV and MNV-1 in cell culture. It has been shown that cathepsin enzymes are involved in entry and replication of some enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including SARS coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, reovirus and Ebola virus (Bosch et al., 2008, Brecher et al., 2012, Mainou and Dermody, 2012, Qiu et al., 2006, Schornberg et al., 2006). However, the function of cathepsin in calicivirus entry has not been previously reported. Once we found that inhibition of cathepsin L function significantly reduce the replication of the tested caliciviruses, we determined if endosomal acidification is important in the replication of PEC and MNV-1, since cathepsin L requires acidic pH for optimal activity, which may reflect their primary location in the late endosomes/lysosomes (Honey and Rudensky, 2003, Turk et al., 2000). For FCV, it was previously reported that maturation of the endosomes is important in FCV replication (Kreutz and Seal, 1995, Stuart and Brown, 2006), and we confirmed that FCV entry is dependent on acidic pH (data not shown). PEC entry has not been previously studied for chloroquine susceptibility and this is the first report that PEC entry requires acidic pH. Of note, MNV-1 entry was previously reported to be pH-independent by other researchers (Gerondopoulos et al., 2010, Perry et al., 2009). Our finding of the dependency of MNV-1 replication on acidification of the endosomes is contrast to previous reports, and the reason for this discrepancy between our finding and others is not clear, although thoroughly removing residual viruses after virus infection was important for observing the inhibitory effects of chloroquine.",

Based on Western blot analysis, cathepsin L cleaved VP2 of PEC and VP1 of FCV and MNV-1 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Although we do not know the significance of FCV and MNV-1 VP1 cleavage by cathepsin L at the present moment, we may speculate that VP1 cleavage by cellular enzymes such as cathepsin L contributes to virus capsid uncoating process to allow release of viral genome for virus replication. Our finding of cleavage of VP2 of PEC by cathepsin L was an unexpected finding. The role of the minor capsid protein VP2 is not clearly understood so far, however, VP2 is implicated in the assembly of virus particle by correctly forming capsid and/or increasing the stability of VP1 of FCV and human noroviruses (Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2003, Di Martino and Marsilio, 2010). Therefore, it prompts us to speculate that VP2 cleavage by cathepsin L may contribute to destabilization of capsid. Although the uncoating process of non-enveloped viruses is poorly understood, reovirus, non-enveloped virus in the Reoviridae family, has been studied well. Reovirus entry and productive replication is dependent on cathepsin L and B for cleavage of outer capsid proteins during entry, which leads to virus disassembly and productive replication (Ebert et al., 2002, Mainou and Dermody, 2012). We were not able to study the effects of cathepsin enzymes on VP2 of FCV and MNV-1 for the lack of specific antibodies, thus it remains to be determined if FCV and MNV-1 VP2 is also processed by cathepsin L or other cellular enzymes. It also needs to be determined if PEC VP1 is processed by other cellular enzymes.",

PEC replication is known to be dependent on the presence of bile acids in cell culture, although the role of bile acid in PEC replication has not been clear (Chang et al., 2005, Chang et al., 2004). In our recent report, we demonstrated that bile acids are required for PEC escape from the endosomes, and endosomal acidification/maturation is also essential for the function of bile acid in the endosomes and/or is independently contribute to virus endosomal escape (Shivanna et al., 2014). In this study, we observed similar phenomenon of virus entrapment of MNV-1 and PEC on confocal microscopy: inhibition of cathepsin L or endosomal acidification led to accumulation of MNV-1 or PEC in the endosomes, preventing virus endosomal escape to initiate virus replication (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). These results demonstrate that cathepsin L activity in the low pH environment is important for calicivirus entry and subsequent replication, and are consistent with the findings of a significant reduction of virus titers by treatment of cells with cathepsin L inhibitors or chloroquine in the cell culture.",
