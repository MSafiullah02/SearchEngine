            "text": "The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan-China was recently discovered in December 2019. By the date of Mar 5th 2020, a total of 49,797 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 had been reported, and 2328 people had died of such infection in Wuhan. 1 COVID-19 has spread around world rapidly, with the number of reported confirmed cases reaching a total of 14,053, 2 imposing a threat to the global public health. Based on the understanding of the pathogen, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, the National Health Committee decided to include COVID-19 pneumonia as category B infectious diseases according to in the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, and to control it by taking prevention and control measures of Category A infectious diseases. 3 People know little about COVID-19 although a series of related studies have been reported. Moreover, there were fewer reports on COVID-19pregnant women and their outcomes. The pathophysiological changes of SARS and MERS during pregnancy are more likely to lead to severe adverse pregnancy outcomes. 4 , 5 Currently, there are insufficient data to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their outcomes. 6 , 7 During the outbreak period, prevention and control of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and new-babies are becoming more important, especially when they undergo delivery during hospitalization. In order to control COVID-19 infection, the isolation suites in our hospital were set up, including outpatient suite, operation room, labor and delivery room, maternal suite, new-baby suite and suite for treating suspected pregnant patients. In order to address the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19, we retrospectively reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings and chest CT scan results of 55 suspected pregnant patients who were admitted to Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, from January 20th to Marth 23th, 2020.",

During hospitalization, if the suspected patients were laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 infection via throat swab test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) by using of quantitative RT-PCR(qPT-PCR), 9 they would be transferred to designated hospital for further treatment. If they were tested negative for more than twice, they could continue to stay in our isolation maternal suite, then go home for isolated observation for two weeks. Additionally, if the cases were not timely diagnosed for suspected COVID-19 on admission, they could be transferred to isolation suite anytime for observation based on symptoms such as fever and/or cough, chest CT scan, and laboratory finding.",

According to the standard of Treat Plan for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) 11 that pleural effusion is rare. It can be seen from Table 2 that the proportion of pregnant women with pleural effusion in the imaging manifestations was 29.1 (16/55), which was significantly higher than that of non-pregnant patients. The pleural effusion reviewed for the first time after delivery has an increasing trend, which may be related to the increase of reactive inflammatory exudation, and the latter stage is characterized by gradual absorption. Certain trend changes presented in the pulmonary lesions. When lung imaging findings reflected as grinding glass sample lesions and patch-like shadows, the frequency of occurrence is gradually decreased with the extension of time. Some cases of pulmonary lesions disappeared, and fiber cable and pleural thickening frequency increased with the extension of time. Pulmonary CT scan on admission was carried out for all 55 cases, among them 3 patients were normal, 52 cases were found abnormal in different degrees including ground-glass opacity, patch-like shadows, fiber shadow, pleural effusion and pleural thickening, and there was no different between the two groups (p < 0.05) as shown in Table 3 .",
