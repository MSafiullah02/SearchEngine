Patients who are very young, elderly, or immunocompromised may present atypically and can have a paucity of these symptoms; however, studies consistently report that the vast majority will have at least one traditional finding [4], [8]. Other classic associations include Brudzinski's and Kernig's signs. The former is seen when the clinician flexes the patient's neck and this, in turn, causes the patient to flex his or her hips. The latter can be observed with the patient lying supine in hip flexion at 90 degrees. The patient will resist the clinician's attempt to fully extend the knee secondary to pain [9]. Patients can also present with photophobia, sore throat, and a rash [10]. A classic petechial rash is most commonly associated with Neisseria meningitidis but can also occur with Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria. The same is true for an often associated complication of meningococcal meningitis, the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. It manifests as meningococcemia (or pneumococcal meningitis [6]) with hypotension and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. In general, an adverse outcome and increased mortality have been observed in persons aged more than 60 years and in patients who initially present with seizure activity or severely altered mental status [4], [5].",

Bacterial meningitis is a rapidly fatal infection; therefore, empiric intravenous antibiotic treatment is appropriate and necessary. The drawback is the increasing antimicrobial resistance, especially among pneumococci [11]. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and the involvement of inflammatory cytokines in the disease process has led to the use of corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment. Although early reports stated that steroids did not affect overall mortality, it was soon recognized that they decrease the rate of complications associated with bacterial meningitis, especially sensorineural hearing loss [3]. Other sequelae include brain damage, learning disabilities, and mental retardation [5], [14]. In 2007 the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews stated that the use of corticosteroids in community-acquired bacterial meningitis reduced mortality, hearing loss, and other neurologic complications in children and adults [15]. As a result, dexamethasone is the drug of choice to be given before or with the first antibiotic dose [12], [15].\nTable 3 shows the current recommendations for antibiotic treatment in suspected bacterial meningitis cases [11], [12].",

In one case report, improvement was observed secondary to immunotherapy [26]; however, the majority of patients in another study actually did worse when compared with patients who were not treated with any steroids or anticonvulsants [19]. Although there is no treatment, fast diagnosis is essential, especially if it involves index cases.

Reports have suggested a mortality rate of 30% to 70% despite aggressive treatment [35] TSS is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococcus. S aureus TSS has a strong association with tampon use, intravaginal contraceptive devices, nasal packing, and postoperative wound infections, whereas group A streptococcus TSS has been linked to minor trauma, surgical procedures, and viral infections, particularly varicella [36]. Of the total cases of S aureus TSS, 93% percent involve women [37]. Group A streptococcus TSS affects all ages and genders equally. The last active surveillance performed in the United States in 1987 by the CDC showed an annual incidence of 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 population in women aged 15 to 44 years; however, the current incidence is likely much lower after the withdrawal of highly absorbent brands of tampons from the market in the late 1980s. Cases of menstrual-related S aureus TSS accounted for over 90% of total TSS cases in 1980 and have significantly decreased to 59% in 1996, with a predicted annual incidence of 1 case per100,000 women [38]. The incidence of group A streptococcus TSS has maintained a consistent level of approximately 3.5 cases per 100,000 people since the 1980s [39]. Menstrual-related cases are more likely to occur in women who use higher absorbency tampons, who keep a single tampon in place for a longer period of time, and who use tampons continuously for more days in their cycle [40]. Nonmenstrual TSS is quickly gaining ground on menstrual-related cases. Women account for 76% of nonmenstrual cases, perhaps because many cases are related to postpartum wound infections and mastitis. Other causes include surgical wounds, sinusitis, burns, respiratory infections, and skin infections. The number of postsurgical-related cases increased nearly twofold from 1986 to 1996, now accounting for 27% of all cases of nonmenstrual-related TSS [37], [41].",

Superantigens activate large numbers of T cells to produce cytokines, including interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon, which results in capillary leakage and tissue damage and development of the signs and symptoms of TSS. In contrast to typical antigens, superantigens do not need to be processed by an antigen-presenting cell to produce the T-cell activation cascade, allowing them to activate many T cells at once and in a very short period of time [42]. S aureus produces TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1) and various enterotoxins, whereas group A streptococcus produces an assortment of pyrogenic exotoxins [43], [44], [45], [46]. The M protein of group A streptococcus is an important virulence factor and gives the organism antiphagocytic properties. Serotypes of group A streptococcus are based on their M type. Those most commonly associated with TSS are M types 1, 3, 12, and 28.",

Despite the fact that studies suggest a decrease in the recurrence rate with antibiotics, episodes are shown to resolve without antibiotics [54]. Clindamycin has been used for the treatment of S aureus TSS since the syndrome was initially defined. Its use is hypothetically supported by its suppression of protein synthesis and, hence, toxin synthesis, and it has been shown to suppress TSST-1 synthesis in vitro by 90% even at levels below inhibitory concentrations [55]. The same study showed that beta-lactam antibiotics actually increased levels of TSST-1, most likely because of their mechanism of action on the cell wall leading to cell lysis or increased membrane permeability resulting in increased release of toxin. A more recent 2006 in vitro study showed that clindamycin and linezolid completely suppressed TSST-1, whereas maximum toxin production occurred with nafcillin and vancomycin [56]. The most appropriate treatment regimen can be selected based on culture and sensitivity results. Patients with suspected S aureus TSS should be treated empirically with clindamycin plus vancomycin or linezolid. If sensitivity results show methicillin-sensitive S aureus, vancomycin can be changed to oxacillin or nafcillin.",

Unfortunately, complicated group A streptococcus infections are shown to have a high mortality rate despite aggressive antibiotic therapy, and penicillin has been shown to have limited effects if not initiated early in the disease. Studies suggest that penicillin loses its effectiveness once large numbers of group A streptococcus are present. This loss is attributed to the fact that penicillins and beta-lactams work best against rapidly growing bacteria. Once concentrations of group A streptococcus build up, replication slows down, reducing the effectiveness of the antibiotic [57]. Clindamycin is now used as an alternative to penicillin for several key reasons. First, clindamycin is not affected by the number of group A streptococcus or the stage of growth. Second, as mentioned previously, clindamycin suppresses protein synthesis, including toxins. Third, it allows phagocytosis of group A streptococcus by inhibiting M-protein synthesis [58], [59], [60]. In addition, clindamycin has a longer postantibiotic effect than penicillin and suppresses the production of tumor necrosis factor. Current guidelines for antibiotic regimens for group A streptococcus TSS are based on limited retrospective trials, which suggest use of a protein synthesis\u2013inhibiting antibiotic (eg, clindamycin) with a cell wall\u2013inhibiting antibiotic (eg, beta-lactams) [61].",

Shortly after its introduction, outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections began to appear [66]. MRSA began primarily as a hospital-acquired infection; however, it is quickly becoming a common community-acquired pathogen. In fact, the rate of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is increasing so rapidly that it now accounts for the majority of community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections and approximately 5% of all community-acquired pneumonias. Necrotizing pneumonia is caused almost exclusively by the CA-MRSA strains. The exact prevalence of necrotizing pneumonia caused by MRSA is unknown; however, the mortality rate of documented cases is significant (30% to 75%) [42], [50], [63], [64]. The prevalence of CA-MRSA colonization and soft tissue infections which include pneumonia is more extensively studied.",

MRSA was present in 59% of cases, and 97% were consistent with CA-MRSA strains [67]. In 2005, a case-control study was conducted to determine the rate of MRSA carriage by performing surveillance cultures on more than 700 patients at hospital admission. Fifty-three percent of the patients were positive for MRSA, and the risk factors associated with colonization included recent antibiotic use (within 3 months), hospitalization within the past year, skin or soft tissue infection on admission, and HIV infection [68]. A 2003 meta-analysis study found that the CA-MRSA prevalence among total hospital-diagnosed MRSA cases was 30.2% in 27 retrospective studies and 37.3% in five prospective studies [69]; however, study samples obtained from community members outside of the health care setting showed a colonization rate of only 1.3%. In addition, studies that excluded people with any health care contacts had an MRSA prevalence of only 0.2%, suggesting that the distinction between hospital-acquired and CA-MRSA is becoming blurred. The term CA-MRSA is now defined by the genetic traits of the strain rather than the means by which colonization or infection occurred.",

Of the 17 case patients identified, 5 died (median age, 28 years), and only 1 had underlying illness. Most died within 1 week of symptom onset. Most infections were caused by MRSA (76%), 85% had the PVL genes, and all were uniformly resistant to macrolides [75]. Another study of 10 cases of CA-MRSA pneumonia occurred in association with the influenza season in 2006 to 2007 [76]. Sixty percent of the patients who were co-infected died of their illness. Various mechanisms by which influenza interacts with S aureus to increase the risk of co-infection have been suggested. They include an influenza-induced increase in S aureus adhesion to the respiratory tract and an increase in S aureus proteases which leads to a synergistic increase in severity of both the influenza and S aureus infection [78], [79], [80].",

Most antimicrobial studies are performed on hospital-acquired MRSA infections, making antibiotic decision making difficult for CA-MRSA pneumonia. Linezolid is a bacteriostatic choice with activity against MRSA that is relatively new to the market. Some studies suggest that linezolid and clindamycin are superior to vancomycin due to their ability to inhibit exotoxin production, specifically PVL [81]; however, an open-label trial of linezolid versus vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia showed equivalent rates of clinical cure (75% versus 75%) [85]. A retrospective analysis of two prospective double-blind clinical trails of hospital-acquired pneumonia suggested that cure rates of linezolid were superior to that of vancomycin (59% versus 36%); however, no differences in outcomes for patients with concomitant bacteremia were appreciated [81], [86], [87], [88]. To date, no study has demonstrated superiority of linezolid over vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia; therefore, the choice remains one of physician preference. Other antibiotics, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and daptomycin, have undergone limited trials with poor demonstrable efficacy.",

No randomized control trials are available at this time that address antiviral therapy. According to WHO guidelines, oseltamivir should be used for antiviral therapy. Anecdotal data suggest that it can reduce mortality. In patients with severe disease, amantadine or rimantadine can be added to the oseltamivir regimen. These drugs should not be used alone. Corticosteroids should only be considered in patients with septic shock and possible adrenal insufficiency. If adult respiratory distress syndrome develops, lung protective mechanical ventilation should be used [102].",
