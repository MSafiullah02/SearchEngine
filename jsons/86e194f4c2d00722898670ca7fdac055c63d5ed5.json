In about a fifth of all patients, this requires aggressive treatment such as mechanical ventilation. Even then, many of these people die.",

For people over 65 years of age, more than half of those infected will die. Just about any lung ailment complicates the disease, and conditions such as emphysema are more common in the elderly. Other concurrent infections may also be involved. Although it is now well established that the SARS virus can kill on its own 8 , other viruses that have been isolated from patients with SARS 9 could exacerbate the illness.",

By the time that most of the lung damage occurs, the amount of virus circulating in the blood has already peaked 10 , suggesting the latter. And the pattern of damage is consistent with an overload of cytokines 9 -biochemical messengers that rev up our immune responses. But for the time being, pathologists are recording an open verdict.",

Those previously identified in people cause nothing nastier than common colds, but some of the coronaviruses that afflict livestock and pets cause more serious conditions. Analysis of the complete genome sequence of the SARS virus, published in May 11 , suggests that it is not closely related to any of the three previously identified coronavirus subfamilies, nor does it seem to have arisen through a chance genetic recombination between known coronaviruses12. \"Its unique sequence suggests that it has evolved independently from the other members of the family, in some animal host, for a long time,\" says Malik Peiris, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong.",

Comparison of the sequences of the viruses found in different animals should make it possible to trace the evolution of the SARS virus and determine which animal passed the disease to humans. Yi Guan, another member of the Hong Kong team, says that related viruses have so far been found in about half-a-dozen species -which he declines to name until the work has been published.",

For example, when the previously unidentified Nipah virus began causing fatal encephalitis in livestock and people in Malaysia in 1998, about one million pigs were slaughtered. Later the virus was found to reside in fruit bats 13 , so farmers could take measures to isolate their livestock from this natural reservoir. \"Once you find the source, you can find out how to manage it better,\" says John Mackenzie, a virologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.",

Recent investigations by researchers at the China Agricultural University in Beijing, for instance, have failed to find SARS-like coronaviruses in 732 animals from 54 wild and 11 domestic species in southern China, including palm civets. As with efforts to investigate the epidemiology of SARS in people, progress may depend on the development of improved diagnostic tests. But potentially, Guan warns, revealing the origins of SARS could require decades of painstaking fieldwork. Southern China's status as the world's primary breeding ground for new strains of flu is explained by the fact that its people, pigs and domestic fowl, which all harbour influenza viruses, live cheek-by-jowl, increasing the likelihood that two strains will recombine genetically to produce a deadly new variant. \"The animals walk in and out of their houses,\" says Kenneth Shortridge, who led the University of Hong Kong's efforts to monitor avian viruses in southern China until his retirement last year. Preliminary evidence suggests that SARS followed a different model, apparently crossing over to people from wild animals, rather than livestock. But this, too, is not terribly surprising, given that the southern Chinese make widespread use of wild species for food and traditional medicine -practices that Chinese health officials are now trying to discourage.",

For instance, in many parts of the country, the diet is lacking in the trace element selenium. A team led by Melinda Beck of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that when the coxsackievirus B3 infects mice deficient in selenium, it mutates at a much higher rate and can become more virulent 14 . Beck suspects that this phenomenon may explain the high incidence of Keshan disease, a weakening of the heart muscle, in some Chinese populations 15 . She has also observed increased mutation rates in flu viruses infecting selenium-deficient mice 16 . \"The fact that China has widespread selenium-deficient areas may play a role in the emergence of new viral strains,\" Beck claims.",
