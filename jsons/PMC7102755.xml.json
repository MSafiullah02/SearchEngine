Cysteine's importance in protein structure is related to the presence of a sulfur-containing thiol group in its side-chain. The thiol group of one cysteine residue is capable of combining with the thiol group of another to form a disulfide bridge, either linking two peptide chains together, as in the case of insulin, or causing a single peptide chain to fold back on itself, making a loop. The unique thiol side-chain (volume 219.43 \u00c53) of this amino acid is often heavily involved in maintaining the proper configuration of both structural proteins and enzymes. Because of its pK\na and ability to form (weak) hydrogen bonds, cysteine has been considered to be a \u201chydrophilic\u201d amino acid. It has a sulfhydryl (SH) group and is found in most proteins.",

In addition, they can be used in chelating metal ions, e.g., in metallo enzymes, iron\u2013sulfur clusters (F2S4), which is important in enzymatic and nucleophilic functions. When two cysteines are bonded by an S\u2013S bond, the resulting molecule between the two protein chains is called cystine. The formation of disulfide bonds between cysteines present within proteins is important to the formation of active structural domains in a large number of proteins. However, they are found mostly in hydrophobic environments, either in free cysteine form (SH) or in disulphide form (SS). Recently, our lab has been involved in studying 3CL proteases which employ cysteine and histidine residues as catalytic dyads in the catalytic site. Around 4% of cysteine residues were observed in our protein sequence which showed a much higher fraction of amino acids within proteins than was expected.",

An analysis of cysteines has enabled us to define their association in a sequence alignment by grouping residues into families. Supplementary research included a consensus approach to cysteine residues within the 3CLpro and extended it to a number of other proteins. The identification of the free cysteines, combined with classification based on functional features and spatial schematics, provides a basis for experimental validation and association of new molecules involved in cysteine activities. Since neighboring residues share physical characteristics (Zvelebil et al., 1987), we have undertaken a more detailed study of the surroundings of cysteine residues in protein structures. The patterns discerned in the distribution of various residues and their constituent around cysteine should be useful in improving our understanding of protein stability, molecular recognition and binding.",

Residues comprising the nine coronavirus main proteases are illustrated in Fig. 1\n.

The presences of 28 cysteine residues (around 9%) in well-conserved positions were also noticed.

We carefully examined some other non-membrane proteins. Approximately 62% and 60% of the aromatic ring faces of phenylalanine and tyrosine, respectively were clustered contiguously to the sulfur atom of cysteins, contrary to the way tryptophan (W) behaved. See Fig. 6\n. This might be because tryptophan not only has the largest nonpolar accessible surface area, but also observed less frequently in our selected proteins. In this regard, further investigation to provide a quantitative explanation is needed.",

Conserved residues mapping on certain characteristics may likewise identify a key site or perhaps a sensible function. Accordingly, the approaches we have presented were based on the structures. Although spatial contacts have been studied to derive contact potentials for the different amino acid interactions (Brocchieri and Karlin, 1995, Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1996, Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1999), the common strategy is to study the number of contacts within a given distance cut-off. To our knowledge structural bioinformatics detection of the cysteines has not been attempted previously. This study has revealed, for the first time, the discrimination of structural versus active free cysteines based on local environment analysis. The computational prediction and annotation of free cysteines in the protein environments has been described through analysis of 3D spatial correspondences.",
