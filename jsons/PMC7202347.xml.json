Similarly, in patients with resistance or intolerance to the current TKI, it is not advisable to delay a change in therapy since the results may be compromised. In case of severe SARS-CoV-2, TKI interruption should be discussed on a case-to-case basis.",

            "text": "In the context of the current pandemic, it is essential to note that TKIs have previously been shown to be effective against other coronaviruses. In 2014 a paper was published in which 290 compounds were screened for antiviral activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Twenty-seven compounds were identified to be active against both strains. Among those, three inhibitors of the kinase signaling pathway were present, two (imatinib mesylate and dasatinib) that are active against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and one (nilotinib) that inhibits SARS-CoV only. The authors suggested that the ABL pathway may be essential for the replication of many different virus families and, therefore, inhibitors of this pathway have the potential to be broad-spectrum antivirals. Mechanistic studies revealed that Abl1 tyrosine kinase regulates budding or release of poxviruses and the Ebola virus. These results demonstrate that c-Abl1 kinase signaling pathways play a critical role in viral egress and suggest that these pathways may also be important in coronavirus replication.13 Follow up research also identified the mechanisms by which TKIs act during coronavirus infection. This work showed that all enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, must first fuse with cellular membranes or with endosomes prior to injection of viral RNA into the host cytoplasm for replication and that TKIs inhibit this process.14",

In the early phases of infection, it inhibits virion fusion with the endosome and subsequent release into the cytoplasm, thus preventing viral entry and viral replication via Abl-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement. In a later phase of the infection, Abl2 protein expression, which is inhibited by both imatinib and dasatinib, enables SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication. These data suggest that Abl2 is a novel host cell protein required for viral growth.15",
