In this study, AZ2-LLV2 was tested in swine as a live or chemically inactivated vaccine. Animals vaccinated with chemically inactivated A12-LLV2 or wild-type (WT) virus in oil adjuvant developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies and were protected from FMD upon challenge. Animals vaccinated with live A12-LLV2 did not exhibit signs of FMD, did not spread virus to other animals, developed a neutralizing antibody response and antibodies to nonstructural protein 30, and were partially protected from FMD. Animals given a similar dose of chemically inactivated A12-LLV2 in the absence of adjuvant developed a poor immune response and were not protected from FMD, indicating that limited replication was responsible for the improved immune response found in animals vaccinated with live A12-LLV2. The results demonstrate the potential of A12-LLV2 as a live-attenuated vaccine as well as a safe source of antigen for chemically inactivated vaccines. 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a debilitating disease of cloven-hoofed animals including swine and cattle. The disease is highly contagious and characterized by fever, vesicular lesions (mainly on the feet, but also on the mouth, nose, and sometimes teats), as well as abortions, and neonatal deaths. Infected animals rapidly spread the virus via aerosol to others, resulting in a dramatic loss of production by the herd. FMD outbreaks are so devastating that countries which do not have the disease restrict the importation of animals and animal products from countries where the disease is present. When FMD is found, infected and exposed animals are slaughtered and ring vaccination surrounding the affected area may be implemented'.'. Vaccines prepared by chemical inactivation of FMDV have been used to successfully control FMD3. However, there is an association of disease outbreaks with incomplete chemical inactivation and escape of USDA virus from vaccine manufacturing facilities4.'. Furthermore, this conventional vaccine induces relatively short-lived immunity and some vaccinated animals can develop a carrier state following contact with FMDV6.'. Over the last 20 yr, a number of alternative approaches in FMD vaccine development have been examined. One of the approaches we have examined is the liveattenuated vaccine. A vaccine based on stably attenuated FMDV could provide improved safety over the existing product?.",

In spite of the evidence of virus replication, vaccination with live A12-LLV2 did not produce signs of disease and A12-LLV2 did not spread to control animals. These results together with our previous results in cattle (see Section 1) demonstrate the safety of A12-LLV2 as a live-attenuated vaccine candidate for livestock. However, an extensive study involving animals of various ages and immune status is required to unequivocally address the safety of this type of vaccine candidate.",

We have taken the approach of deleting the entire L coding region of FMDV to produce an attenuated virus suitable for use as a live vaccine. This virus has a deletion of a complete coding region which significantly reduces the risk of reversion to virulence as compared to attenuated viruses produced by conventional means. M.oreover, we have demonstrated that this virus can be used as a source of antigen in traditional BEI-inactivated vaccines; since A12-LLV2 is non-pathogenic and does not spread between animals, its use in vaccine production could reduce the risk associated with current vaccine manufacture.",
