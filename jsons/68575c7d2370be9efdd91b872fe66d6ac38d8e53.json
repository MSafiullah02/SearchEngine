Intervening measures to eradicate such infectious diseases rely on the methods used to evaluate the outbreak when it occurs. Any outbreak in a country or province usually occurs at different levels of magnitude with respect to time i.e. seasonal changes, adaptation of virus over time. Usually patterns exhibited in such scenarios are non-linear in nature and this motivates us to design the system that can capture such non-linear dynamic changes. With the help of these non-linear systems, we can describe the transmission of such infectious diseases. In [1] [2] a transmission model for malaria and in [3] a mathematical model for analysing dynamics of tuberculosis has been developed to study the transmission using mathematical models. In [4] a laplacian based decomposition is used to solve the non-linear parameters in a Pine Witt disease. A modified SIRS model in [5] successfully helped to control the syncytial virus in infants. Similarly mathematical models presented in [6] , [7] helped clinicians to better understand the characteristics of human liver and transmission of dengue outbreak.",

R0 forecasts the number of people can get the infection from the infected person. In this model, an extra weight is applied to the person who never infected the current disease nor vaccinated. If the value of R0 of a disease is 10, then the infected person will spread the disease to 10 other people surrounding him. In [11] authors used R0 method to find the infection rate of novel virus on diamond princes cruise ship [11] . However, in such method it is difficult to find the starting point of the infectious disease by identifying patient zero and the people he interacted with during his incubation period. It is worth noting that mathematical models presented in [12] , [13] , [14] can be used to solve the complex non-linear patterns of infectious diseases.",

In the world of smart devices, data is being generated in the unprecedented way than ever before and promoted the role of machine learning in healthcare [16] . The world today is more connected than ever before this helped to share the real time infectious data between the countries. The distinctive feature of artificial intelligence is its flexibility, domain adaptation and economical to integrate with existing systems. Over the last few weeks, many researchers came up with several mathematical models to predict the transmission of novel corona virus [17] [18] . The major drawbacks of the existing models are linear, non-temporal and several assumptions while modelling the network. First of all, the covid-19 is a time series data set and it is highly recommended to use the sequential networks to extract the patterns from it. Second of all, the data we are dealing with is dynamic in nature so by using statistical and epidemiological models, results are often vague [19] [20] . In [21] , [22] , [23] , [24] researchers used deep learning based LSTM networks to forecast COVID-19 infections. The LSTM models used in the above networks could not able to represent the spatio-temporal components simultaneously. In this paper we addressed the above problem by modifying the internal connections. In our modified LSTM cells, We have established the alternative connections between the input and output cells. This type of connections not only helps the networks to preserve spatio-temporal components, but also to transfer the historical information to the next units.",

Previous studies on COVID-19 predictions, did not considered the recovery rate while developing the model. In this research, we considered the recovery rate as one of the features while building our model.

Data collected over regular intervals of time is called time-series (TS) data and each data point is equally spaced over time. TS prediction is the method of forecasting upcoming trends/patterns of the given historical dataset with temporal features. In order to forecast COVID-19 transmission, it would be effective if input data has temporal components and it is different from traditional regression approaches. A time series (TS) data can be break downed into trend, seasonality and error. A trend in TS can be observed when a certain pattern repeats on regular intervals of time due to external factors like lockdown of country, mandatory social distancing, quarantines etc. In many real-world scenarios, either of trend or seasonality are absent. After finding the nature of TS, various forecasting methods have to be applied on given TS Given the TS, it is broadly classified into 2 categories i.e. stationary and non-stationary. A series is said to be stationary, if it does not depend on the time components like trend, seasonality effects. Mean and variances of such series are constant with respect to time. Stationary TS is easier to analyze and results skilful forecasting. A TS data is said to nonstationary if it has trend, seasonality effects in it and changes with respect to time. Statistical properties like mean, variance, sand standard deviation also changes with respect to time.",

The rate of infections in USA, Italy and Spain are growing exponentially meanwhile, the number of infections in Canada are increasing linearly in figure 3. If Canadians follow the regulations strictly, the number of confirmed cases will soon decline. In our LSTM model-1 we trained and tested our network on Canadian dataset; the RMSE error is 34.83 with an accuracy of 93.4% for short term predictions in Canada. Meanwhile, based on our testing/validation dataset the RMSE error is about 45.70 with an accuracy of 92.67% for long term predictions. The predictions of LSTM model are shown in 4 with solid red line. It shows that our model was able to capture the dynamics of the transmission with minimum loss. From the figure 4 we can say that Canada witnessed linear growth in cases until March 16 2020 after its first confirmed case. The current epidemic in Canada is predicted to continue until June 2020. Our second LSTM model-2 is trained on Italian dataset to predict short-term and long-term infections in Canada. For short term predictions, the RMSE error is about 51.46 which is higher than previous model. Accord-COVID-19 forecasting using LSTM Networks ing to this second model within 10 days, Canada is expected to see exponential growth of confirmed cases. It was a challenging task to forecast the dynamics of transmission based on small dataset. Even though COVID-19 outbreak started in Canada around early January, the consistent epidemiological data wasn't released until early February. Because of small dataset several statistical models struggled to select the optimal parameters and several unknown variables led to uncertainty in their predictions. LSTM model is different from statistical methods in many ways for instance, the proposed LSTM network fits the real-time data and without any assumptions while selecting hyperparameters. It was able to overcome the parameter assumptions using cross validation and achieved better performance by reducing the uncertainty. After reaching the inflection point, the recovery rate will start decrease rapidly and death rate may increase at the same time as shown in figure 5 . In order to find the trend of the infections we decomposed the given series and the trend of infections is increasing with respect to time. Further, number of infections followed increasing trend from Sunday to Tuesday and followed decreasing trend until Saturday as shown in figure 6 .",
