            "text": "Virus\u2013host interactions have long been studied since the first discovery of Tobacco Mosaic Virus in 1898. However, due to the limitation of experimental tools to investigate the mass interacting networks was not always simple. The investigation became more productive upon the technical development of protein biochemistry, nucleic acid sequencing, and several high-throughput screening systems. Three common methods used for high-throughput protein interaction analysis are yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system, affinity purification, and protein chip [1]. Y2H was first described in 1989 for identifying and analyzing various protein\u2013protein interactions in the yeast model [2]. The GAL4 based Y2H system relies on the GAL4 transcription activator, which consists of a DNA binding domain (BD) and a transcription activating domain (AD). The yeast strain used in this system contains several nutrient gene mutations and without adding these nutrients into the culturing media, these yeast cells will not grow. Successful introduction of separate bait and prey plasmids into the mutant yeast strain will provide the lacking nutrients hence the yeast cells will survive. One or more reporter genes will be cloned under the control of the UAS-GAL4 promoter. If the BD-bait fusion protein interacts with the AD-prey fusion protein, the GAL4 activator becomes functional and binds to the GAL UAS promoter region, then activates the reporter gene(s). The expression of one or more reporter genes thus indicates that there are protein\u2013protein interactions between the target protein (bait) and the others (prey). The activation of reporter genes provides a platform to select the yeast clones that have protein\u2013protein interactions. Most reporter genes used in this system are the complements of the mutated nutrient genes, e.g., Histidine, or an enzyme that catalyzes a color change reaction, e.g., LacZ. Figure 1 gives a schematic view of the yeast two-hybrid system. High-throughput screening of cDNA library by Y2H system provides a fast and comprehensive way to identify the possible proteins in the library that could interact with the bait protein. The yeast clones containing the interacting proteins will survive in a nutrient lacking medium due to the activation of the reporter gene.\n",

            "text": "The identification of virus\u2013host interactions could facilitate the understanding of viral strategy to manipulate cellular functions for its survival or to know how the host controls and eliminates the pathogens. Several studies have used Y2H techniques to study the protein\u2013protein interactions between viruses and host cells [3\u20136]. A list of the interacting cellular proteins can be established after screening using a viral protein as the bait, providing a framework for further study on the relationship between the virus and the host. However, there are several limitations in this strategy that must be considered. First, due to the modular nature, the fusion proteins are sometimes not folded in a native form; second, the posttranslational modifications of some proteins in mammalian cells are not present in the yeast system, if the interactions between proteins are dependent on these modifications, false-negative results would be observed. In Y2H systems, both the BD-fused and AD-fused proteins must be targeted to the nucleus; therefore, extracellular proteins or organelle targeted proteins may not work in this system. The protocol written in this chapter is used to study protein\u2013protein interactions of cytosolic proteins. Protocols used to study interactions between membrane proteins were depicted previously [7, 8]. We have used the protocol to identify many cellular factors interacting with different viral proteins [9\u201311], including SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein [12].",

            "text": "To obtain a more reliable result of the protein\u2013protein interactions, further experiments should be carried out to verify these interactions, e.g., co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy analyses. After Y2H screening, co-immunoprecipitation is a biochemical method often used to verify whether the identified prey protein physically interacts with the bait protein in cells. Figure 2 shows a schematic summary of the co-immunoprecipitation assay. Specific antibodies against X protein or tag 1 peptide will first be coupled to Protein A/G beads, if the X protein is immunoprecipitated, then the Y protein which interacts with the X protein should be precipitated along with it. If the paired proteins of interest (X-Y) are indeed interacting with each other in cells, then these two proteins should also be co-localized in cells. Confocal microscopy analysis is used to verify the co-localization of the two interacting proteins. The co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy analysis protocols written in this chapter have been used in our lab to study several protein\u2013protein interactions [9, 11\u201316].\n",

            "text": "\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a single-cell eukaryote frequently used in scientific research. The laboratory yeast strains usually carry several nutrient gene mutations; therefore, complementation of exogenous amino acids could provide the nutrients for yeast cells to survive. Two most common media used in the Y2H system are the full medium (YEPD) which contains all the nutrients for yeast, and the selection medium which contains only several selective amino acids added to the minimal medium.Yeast cells used for transformation should be in log phase. Transformation efficiency in this phase is better than that in stationary phase.Positive and negative controls should be included in all tests.Addition of 10 % DMSO will increase the transformation efficiency.Whenever Western blotting analysis was conducted to verify protein expression, adding protease inhibitors in the samples could prevent the degradation of protein samples.Self-activation should be tested before using the bait proteins for library screening to avoid false-positive clones. It is not necessary to test the self-activation of prey proteins.In the GAL4 based two-hybrid system, LacZ and His3 genes are usually used as reporter systems to verify the protein\u2013protein interactions. In our lab, 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) is added to the selection plate as a competitive inhibitor of the His3-gene product. Results of yeast growth in plates with different concentrations of 3AT are shown in Fig. 3. X-Gal filter lift assay is also serves as a double confirmation test to avoid false-positive clones [10].If Y protein interacts physically with X protein, Y protein will be immunoprecipitated by anti-X antibody in the presence but not absence of X protein. To avoid the cross-reaction of anti-X, a negative control should be included, i.e., Y protein in the cell lysate without X protein would not be precipitated by the anti-X antibody.When co-IP is performed (Subheading 3.9), add 9/10 of the protein samples for the immunoprecipitation assay (the 12th step). 1/10 of the protein samples serve as an input control for Western blotting analysis.It is annoying to have the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins in the background of Western blotting analysis following immunoprecipitation, especially when the size of the target protein is close to that of the heavy chain or light chain. Cross-linking of the antibody to protein A/G beads using a cross-linker, e.g., disuccinmidyl suberate, should prevent the co-elution of heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins. Alternatively, a commercial immunoprecipitation kit, like EasyBlot (Genetex), provides a secondary antibody which specifically reacts with the native, non-reduced form of IgG. This will decrease the interference of heavy chain and light chain of IgG.If the primary antibodies against two proteins (or peptide tags) are derived from the same animal species, it is necessary to conjugate a fluorescent dye directly to one primary antibody. Incubate the other primary antibody without a conjugated fluorescent dye first, followed by the secondary antibody against this primary antibody. Then, add the primary antibody with a conjugated fluorescent dye to the sample for incubation.\n",

Three different colonies picked from the \u2212W\u2212L\u2212H+G plate while screening for pBDGAL4-X binding proteins (BP) using cDNA library were then seeded onto selection plates with different concentrations of 3AT (50 or 100 mM). On the plate with 50 mM 3AT, yeast with BP1 and BP2 but not with BP3 survived. Therefore, BP1 and BP2 showed stronger interaction with protein X than that of BP3. In the plate with 100 mM 3AT, BP2 showed stronger interaction with protein X than that of BP1. BP3 was identified as a false positive by this selection system",
