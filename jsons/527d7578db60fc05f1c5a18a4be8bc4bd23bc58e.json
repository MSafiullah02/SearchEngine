The 14 author presents a telemedicine case in which a patient developed varicella zoster virus 15 reactivation of the V2 dermatome during the course of COVID-19 infection. In addition, the 16 patient developed severe acute herpetic neuralgia despite the early initiation year-old otherwise healthy female was seen by telemedicine consultation for a 20 new facial rash. She reported that over the past week she had felt unwell, with one episode of 21 fever to 38.8\u00b0C, which quickly defervesced. She also experienced aches and chills, headache, 22 and profound fatigue. She denied sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, anosmia, or ageusia, 23 and had no history of diabetes, hypertension, or cardiac disease. On the 7 th day of symptoms, 24 she developed a mildly itchy rash on the trunk. The following day several dysesthetic papules 25 and vesicles appeared on her left upper cutaneous lip, and over the next 24 hours edema and 26 similar lesions appeared throughout the V2 dermatome. Based on the patient's self-27 photograph (Figure 1), a presumptive diagnosis of herpes zoster was made, and the patient was 28 started on valacyclovir 1 gram three times daily within 12 hours of the initial eruption. The 29 patient was also advised to present for consideration of COVID-19 testing based on her other 30 symptoms. On follow-up telephone visit 48 hours later, she noted that her COVID-19 RT-PCR 31 test was positive. The eruption was slow to respond to therapy and persisted after 7 days of 32 treatment (Figure 2). During this time, the patient developed sensations of skin burning and 33 3 allodynia, as well as sinus and tooth pain.
