Occurrence of ALI and ARDS can be due to exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), endotoxins produced by Gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies have found that focal aggregation of lung fibroblasts occurred prior to formation of fibrosis [5], implying that aberrant proliferation of fibroblasts takes place in the early stages of ALI/ARDS. Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by fibroblast proliferation and differentiation to myofibroblast that are responsible for production of collagen [6,7]. Our previous studies have shown that LPS was able to directly induce secretion of collagen in primary cultured mouse lung fibroblasts via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated activation of the phosphoinositide3-kinase-Akt (PI3-K-Akt) pathway [8,9]. LPS was also reported to induce fibroblasts proliferation [10], down-regulate phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression [11,12].",

Downregulation of PTEN expression and suppression of its dephosphorylation activity induce proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of glioma cells through activation of the PI3-K-Akt-glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) pathway, suggesting that PTEN may be involved in inactivation of PI3-K signaling [14]. PTEN restoration was also related to the inhibition of differentiation of human lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts through extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/Akt inhibition [15]. The negative regulatory role of PTEN on the PI3-K-Akt pathway suggests that, without LPS stimulation, PTEN prevents the proliferation of lung fibroblasts, and that overexpression of PTEN might abrogate the fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, activation of PI3-K-Akt-GSK3\u03b2 and collagen secretion induced by LPS. Thus, the mechanism by which PTEN is directly involved in LPS-induced fibroblast proliferation through regulation of the PI3-K-Akt-GSK3\u03b2 pathway requires further elucidation.",

PTEN, a tumor suppressor, is involved in the proliferation of various cells [19-23]; a decrease in PTEN expression results in the activation of the PI3-K-Akt signaling pathway [24]. Therefore, further study exploring the mechanism by which PTEN influences LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation and differentiation has important clinical implications. Our results in the present study indicate that LPS-induced downregulation of PTEN is directly involved in fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion by way of the PI3-K-Akt-GSK3\u03b2 pathway, and could be overcome by the overexpression of PTEN. This suggests that PTEN may be a potential intervention target for pulmonary fibrosis.",

Protein products of the PTEN gene can inactivate PI3-K activity with its dephosphorylation activity [40]. We previously showed that blockade of PI3-K using a pharmacological inhibitor (Ly294002) decreased lung fibroblast collagen secretion [41]. As a downstream molecule of PI3-K-Akt, GSK3\u03b2 is also involved in cell growth and other cell cycle-related biological functions [42-44]. Activation or phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 was found to be a factor in LPS-induced or TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in immune cells [45-47]. In the current study, we found that overexpression of PTEN enhanced the inhibitory effect of Ly294002 on cell growth, differentiation and collagen secretion concomitant with suppression of phosphorylation of Akt. Our results also suggested that activation of GSK3\u03b2 was involved in the LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion. Considering GSK3\u03b2 was found to be an important downstream molecule of PI3-K-Akt in our previous studies [48] and that of others [49], we reasoned that the activation of PI3-K-Akt-GSK3\u03b2 complex signaling pathways played important role in mediating the LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion.",

This implies that the dephosphorylation activity of PTEN is more crucial in the regulation of lung fibroblast functions than PTEN expression. These findings were in accord with one study using lung cancer cells [51]. More experiments using PTEN short interfering RNA (siRNA) are required to further confirm the role of PTEN in affecting lung fibroblast functions. In addition, whether LPS-induced Akt phosphorylation or GSK3\u03b2 expression is the major cause of fibroblast proliferation needs to be determined. Other studies have shown that TSC-2 [52], PRAS40 [53], mTORC [54], GSK3 [55] and FOXO [56] are involved in the phosphorylation of Akt, cell proliferation, and survival pathways. Thus, further determining the role of Akt using Akt siRNA or GSK3\u03b2 siRNA in lung fibroblast proliferation may be required.",
