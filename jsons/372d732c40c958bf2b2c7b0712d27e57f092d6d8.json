To rule out the possible effect of number of referrals to the emergency department in different periods, we calculated incidence corrected for number of patients seen at the emergency department. We found that in the past 5 years, from January, 2015, to December, 2019, 98 572 patients had been evaluated, with a mean of 1642 (SD 280) per month, compared with 283 patients per month during the study periodapproximately six-fold lower. With these figures, the incidence of Kawasaki disease in group 1 was 0\u00b7019% (95% CI -0\u00b7002 to 0\u00b70019), compared with 3\u00b75% (-3\u00b75 to 3\u00b76) in group 2 (odds ratio 184; p<0\u00b70001; figure). To rule out the possible effect of a change in the geographical catchment area in the prepandemic (group 1) versus the pandemic (group 2) period, we reviewed the place of residence of all our patients with Kawasaki disease and drew a referral map, showing that all but one came from the Bergamo province (appendix p 1).

The most accepted hypothesis supports an aberrant response of the immune system to one or more unidentified pathogens in genetically predisposed patients; 21-23 however, the search for the infectious triggers has been disappointing. 24 In Japan, during three epidemics recorded in 1979, 1982, and 1986 , the highest Kawasaki disease incidence was seen in January, potentially suggesting that factors during winter months may trigger Kawasaki disease. 25, 26 In 2010, the incidence of Kawasaki disease in Japan was 239\u00b76 per 100 000 children younger than 5 years, compared with 20\u00b78 per 100 000 in the USA. 27 A 2-year retrospective survey done in northeastern Italy calculated an incidence of 14\u00b77 cases per 100 000 children younger than 5 years. 28 We report a high number of Kawasaki-like disease cases in the Bergamo province following the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, with a monthly incidence that is at least 30 times greater than the monthly incidence of the previous 5 years, and has a clear starting point after the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in our area. Group 2, diagnosed after SARS-CoV-2 appeared, showed evidence of seroconversion to the virus in the majority of patients. A serological test was not done. This report was followed by commentaries expressing a mixed sense of interest and scepticism. 30 The arguments against this association were expressed by a group from Japan, who did a retrospective study [31] [32] [33] on nasopharyngeal swab samples from 19 children with Kawasaki disease and 208 controls with respiratory tract infections, and found RNA sequences of HCoV-NH in five (2%) of 208 controls versus zero of 19 children with Kawasaki disease.",

It is possible that in the remaining two patients, who both had a negative serology, con founding factors played a role. One patient was tested just after an infusion of high-dose immunoglobulins. Additionally, qualitative antibody testing is reported to have a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 85-90% when compared with PCR test by nasal swab. It is also possible that this patient represents an usual presentation of Kawasaki disease outside of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, as seen in previous years. Only two patients in group 2 presented a positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sampling for SARS-CoV-2. This finding and the positivity of IgG antibodies suggest a late onset of the disease compared with the primary infection, due to the host immune response. This might be the reason why, in the past, no active viral infection could be shown in this disease. All these results and considerations support the hypothesis that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a Kawasaki-like disease in susceptible patients.",

This estimate is based on the limited data from the case series in this region.",

Patients diagnosed with Kawasaki-like disease after the viral spreading revealed a severe course, including KDSS and MAS, and required adjunctive steroid treatment.
