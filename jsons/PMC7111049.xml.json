The predicted S gene is located from nucleotide 21,492 to 25,259 in the SARS-CoV genome. In order to clone S gene, the 3580-bp DNA fragment containing whole S gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into prokaryotic vector pET-28(+). The deduced amino acid sequence of S protein is shown in Fig. 2\n. S gene had an ORF of 3768 nucleotides, capable of coding for a 1255-amino-acid polypeptide of about 138 kDa. The amino terminus of SARS-CoV S protein contained a short type I signal peptide (residue 1\u201313) composed of hydrophobic amino acids that are presumably removed during cotranslational transport through ER. The carboxyl terminus (residue 1196\u20131255) consisted of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail rich in cysteine residues. Twenty-three potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted among SARS-CoV S protein. Together these data predicted that SARS-CoV S protein is a type I membrane glycoprotein with the N-terminus and the majority of the protein (residue 14\u20131195) on the outside of virus particle, in agreement with other coronavirus S protein data (Fig. 1B).",

Alignment of these sequences produced a low level of similarity (20\u201327% pairwise amino acid identity) between the predicted amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV S protein and other coronavirus S proteins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the species formed monophyletic clusters consistent with established taxonomic groups. However, SARS-CoV S protein sequences segregated into a well-resolved branch, indicating that SARS-CoV S protein is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronavirus S proteins. Although overall sequence conservation was low, the C-terminus, consisting of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail, was highly conserved. Putative cellular receptor-binding sites (residue 757\u2013761) of SARS-CoV S protein [19] were not conserved compared with other coronaviruses. The antigenic sites of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus S protein [20], [21] were also varied among these coronaviruses. These data suggested that comparison of primary amino acid sequences does not provide insight into the receptor-binding specificity or antigenic properties of SARS-CoV S protein.",

The antigenicity of SARS-CoV S protein was further analyzed based on three aforementioned criteria, and the regions in which antigenic index exceeds 1.3 are shown in Fig. 4B. Most of the putative antigenic sites were located at outer membrane regions, in which residue 1\u2013100 and 401\u2013500 exhibited the highly antigenic potential. Because most T cell and B cell epitopes contain a sequence of 6\u201320-amino acids [25], [26], we further analyzed the antigenicity using a window of 15 residues. Residue 12\u201350, 426\u2013456, 478\u2013494, 541\u2013564, and 922\u20131118 of SARS-CoV S protein displayed the highly antigenic potential.

We expressed the S protein from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain transformed with a pET plasmid carrying S gene. After induction with IPTG, a product with 138-kDa was observed by SDS\u2013PAGE analysis (Fig. 5\n). The amount of induced S protein was consistent when the bacteria were refreshed to 0.45\u20130.6 OD600 and the recombinant S protein was expressed in the soluble form in bacterial cells. The soluble S protein was further purified by affinity chromatography using His-Bond resin. No detectable S protein was purified, suggesting that the histidine tag is folded into the interior of S protein (data not shown). We therefore denatured the S protein by urea, purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, and renatured the protein by dialysis. The amount of recombinant S protein recovered was approximately 0.2\u20130.3 mg/100 ml of bacterial culture (Fig. 6\n).",

The binding ability of S protein to cell extract was evaluated by OD405 value in ELISA. Fig. 8A\nshows that the binding ability of S protein to BSA was very low. However, S protein significantly bound Vero cell extracts with the OD405 exceeding 0.9.
