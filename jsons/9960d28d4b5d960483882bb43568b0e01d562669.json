In the 1940s, Medawar reported that allografts in the CNS survived longer than those in other tissues (Medewar, 1948) , which led Barker and Billingham to coin the term immune privilege to describe such sites (Barker and Billingham, 1977) . The concept of limited immune responsiveness in the brain was interpreted as being consistent with the overriding need to control inflammatory reactions and their potentially damaging consequences to neuronal networks with low regenerative capacity. The absence of a lymphatic system within the CNS and the presence of a specialized blood-brain barrier (BBB) in most CNS compartments suggested immune isolation achieved by restricting entry of blood-born molecules such as immunoglobulins, as well as leukocytes, albeit by mechanisms that are under constant revision (Bechmann et al., 2007) . With several decades of more detailed observations of immune responses in the CNS, it is now clear that both protective (e.g., antiviral) and pathogenic (e.g., autoimmune) immune responses can and do occur in the CNS, but these may be quantitatively and qualitatively different to those occurring in other sites. In a reappraisal of CNS immune privilege (Bechmann et al., 2007) , many compelling arguments were made for a redefinition of privilege, underlining that it is a relative state, and only applicable to the parenchyma of the intact, noninflamed brain.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 301, "end": 316, "text": "(Medewar, 1948)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 408, "end": 437, "text": "(Barker and Billingham, 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1030, "text": "(Bechmann et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1410, "text": "(Bechmann et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immune Privilege and Cancer Immunosurveillance"}, {"text": "Moreover, perhaps in view of the longstanding, oversimplistic interpretations of immune privilege, one of the cornerstones of modern tumor immunology, the cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis of Burnet and Thomas (Burnet, 1970) was not immediately seen to directly concern brain tumors. The theory proposes that the immune system continually surveys the organism and recognizes and destroys abnormal cells. Recognition of cancer certainly occurs, but it is now clear that the outcome of such detection is not always protective immunosurveillance. This led to a refined theory of immunoediting (Dunn et al., 2006) in which different outcomes are described following cancer and immune system interaction: namely, elimination, equilibrium, and tumor escape. Analysis of mouse models with clearly defined immunodeficiencies shows that both innate and adaptive immune responses influence tumor outgrowth: mice lacking T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and those with deficiencies in Type 1 or Type 2 interferons (IFNs) have higher tumor incidence. Moreover, analyses of large cohorts of immunosuppressed patients show that incidence of not only virally associated cancers but also cancers with no known association with infection is increased. However, to date, brain tumors have not been among the tumors noted to occur more frequently. This is likely due to the lower expected frequency of these malignancies, but it may also be because brain tumors are rarely eliminated spontaneously, and more likely persist in equilibrium with the host. Or else they rapidly escape immune control, as would appear to be the case once malignant gliomas are detected. In this case, the notion of immunoediting predicts that outgrowing tumors will have been sculpted by interaction with the immune system, for example, by selection of tumors able to neutralize immune effector mechanisms, as will be discussed (see below).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 227, "text": "(Burnet, 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 593, "end": 612, "text": "(Dunn et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immune Privilege and Cancer Immunosurveillance"}, {"text": "It should be noted that these ideas are in the context of spontaneous immunity against spontaneous cancers.

Immunotherapies must reinforce, reproduce, or substitute for each of these phases. We will outline the general features of how and where the stages of an idealized spontaneous antitumor immune response occur, indicating the particularities of the CNS. The first step in tumor immunity is alerting the immune system to the presence of tumor; this is achieved by innate immunity. The innate immune system comprises soluble factors such as components of the complement system, but more important for tumor immunity are the cells, such as the macrophages/ microglia, granulocytes, NK cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). These cells Fig. 48 .1 The stages of T-cell mediated tumor immunity. The tissue damage and stress associated with tumor growth will alert cells of the innate immune system, including microglia. Resident or recruited APC (i) phagocytose tumor-derived antigen (e.g., cellular debris) and transport it to LNs (ii). Tumor antigens can also arrive in the LN following peripheral vaccination (iii). Immigrant DC or LN resident DC presents antigen to na\u0131\u00a8ve T cells, leading to their activation and clonal expansion (iv). Activated T cells exit the LN and infiltrate the site of tumor growth (v) to exert their effector functions efficiently detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns by means of germlineencoded pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) that include the toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, their role is now understood to be wider than merely detecting infection by a pathogen; they can also detect perturbations to the organism that can be considered ''dangerous'' (Matzinger, 1994) , and PRR can also be viewed as ''pattern'' recognition receptors able to deliver danger signals. For example, endogenous ligands have been identified for all human TLRs except for TLRs 5 and 10. These include the heat shock proteins (HSPs) upregulated by stressed cells (binding to TLRs 2 and 4) and nucleic acids released by dying tumor cells (binding to TLRs 3, 7, and 9) (Barrat and Coffman, 2008 ; Barton and Medzhitov, 2002; Pulendran, 2005) . Detection of cancer will be initially mediated by tissue-resident sentinel cells of the innate immune system, which for most tissues are the DCs and the macrophages. But for the brain, DCs are not resident in the parenchyma (although they may appear at later stages of a response), and the most important endogenous sentinels are the microglial cells (Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007) . These specialized brain macrophages are widely distributed throughout the brain parenchyma and may actually be recruited to the site of glioma occurrence, where they can represent up to a third of the cells composing the tumor (Graeber et al., 2002) . Microglia express several TLRs, including TLR 4 that is proposed to bind several factors produced by dying cells in the glioma microenvironment (Hussain et al., 2006) . If TLR ligation leads to full activation of the microglial cell, subsequent functions potentially include phagocytosis, chemokine and cytokine release, antigen presentation, and even tumor cell killing. However, other less useful outcomes have been suggested, including neurotoxicity and enhancement of tumor invasiveness through the upregulation of metalloproteinases. These contrasting functions may be attributed to the extreme plasticity of microglia in response to their local milieu. Indeed, the brain microenvironment in which they must function is also comprised of astroglial cells which exhibit characteristics of innate immune function, including PRR expression, activation to a reactive state, and secretion of cytokines and chemokines (Farina et al., 2007) . Furthermore, in the case of malignancy, microglial function will also be subject to modulation by the local tumor microenvironment (Hussain et al., 2006; Markovic et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 942, "end": 949, "text": "Fig. 48", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1907, "end": 1924, "text": "(Matzinger, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2325, "text": "(Barrat and Coffman, 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2328, "end": 2355, "text": "Barton and Medzhitov, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2372, "text": "Pulendran, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 2726, "end": 2756, "text": "(Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2986, "end": 3008, "text": "(Graeber et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 3155, "end": 3177, "text": "(Hussain et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 3928, "end": 3949, "text": "(Farina et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 4083, "end": 4105, "text": "(Hussain et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 4106, "end": 4128, "text": "Markovic et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 303, "end": 312, "text": "Fig. 48.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "The Stages of Tumor Immunity"}, {"text": "In a protective antitumor immune response, once the endogenous sentinels of innate immunity are alerted, there are two subsequent events: to limit (or eliminate) the source of danger by innate effector functions of resident cells and to recruit further resources (particularly T cells, as discussed in the next section). For glioma, there is little in vivo evidence to suggest that tumoricidal microglia spontaneously restrain brain tumor growth (Graeber et al., 2002) . The other innate effector cell that has the potential to recognize and kill tumor cells is the NK cell, which has been the subject of intensive investigations to characterize the receptors that regulate its function. In order to mediate cytolysis, NK cells must receive a signal through one of their activating receptors such as NKG2D, but to result in activation, there must be an absence of signaling through inhibitory receptors (e.g., members of the CD158 family of receptors) (Lanier, 2008) . Expression of ligands for NKG2D is low on normal cells, but upregulated on cells subjected to genotoxic stress, as occurs in neoplastic transformation. Indeed, certain human glioma fulfill the requirements for NK cell recognition and activation, with expression of the NKG2D ligands MICA/B (major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-chain-related molecules A and B) and UL16-binding proteins (ULBP) 1-3 (Eisele et al., 2006) , and a downregulation of some HLA molecules which are ligands for the CD158 inhibitory receptors (Facoetti et al., 2005) . NK cells are not only cytotoxic but also an early source of IFN-g, which can be angiostatic and can amplify T-cell mediated tumor immunity. However, little is known about the NK cells or their potential impact at the tumor site in human glioma; although in a murine intracranial tumor model (B16 melanoma), interactions between DCs, NK cells, and T cells facilitated protective tumor immunity (Prins et al., 2006c) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 446, "end": 468, "text": "(Graeber et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 952, "end": 966, "text": "(Lanier, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1398, "text": "(Eisele et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1520, "text": "(Facoetti et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1916, "end": 1937, "text": "(Prins et al., 2006c)", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Innate Immune Functions"}, {"text": "Brain Tumors: From the Brain to the Lymph Node", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Induction of Adaptive Immune Responses Against"}, {"text": "Although macrophages and microglia are the major components of the immune infiltrate in brain tumors at every stage of the response, after initial detection of the malignancy they will be joined by T lymphocytes, which are responsible for the cell-mediated immune responses of adaptive immunity.

On the other hand, antibodies administered therapeutically have important applications in glioma therapy and will be covered elsewhere in this book (see Chapter 36). In this chapter, the focus is on T cells (both CD4 and CD8 subsets), which once activated have the potential to infiltrate tumors and mediate potent effector functions including cytotoxicity and local cytokine release.

Such atypical T-cell trafficking probably does not account for a significant proportion of T cells under normal conditions and may even be associated with tolerance induction rather than induction of efficient antitumor immunity. Therefore, for understanding the generation of efficacious tumor immunity, the ''conventional'' trafficking and activation of T cells in LNs will be considered here. A large number of T cells are generated in each individual, with each bearing clonally distributed antigen receptors that are generated by somatic rearrangement of a limited number of gene segments. These encode a heterodimeric T-cell receptor for antigen (TCR) comprised of a and b chains for the main T-cell population that will be discussed here, and of g and d chains for receptors used by a minority gd T-cell population. The ligands for the TCR of CD8 T cells are short peptides of around 8-10 amino acids bound to class I MHC molecules, whereas CD4 T cells recognize slightly longer peptides ($13-17 amino acids) bound to MHC class II molecules. Since TCR are randomly generated, the repertoire potentially includes receptors of any conceivable specificity, but the frequencies of na\u0131\u00a8ve T cells expressing a TCR of a given specificity in the whole T cell population are very low (in the order of 1 in 10 6 cells), necessitating significant clonal expansion in order for T cells to achieve a biological effect in vivo.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 155, "text": "(Brabb et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Generation of Na\u0131\u00a8ve CD4 and CD8 T Cells"}, {"text": "If na\u0131\u00a8ve T cells receive only a single signal via ligation of their TCR by an MHC/ peptide complex, they may become anergic, i.e., without effector function and refractory to further stimulation.

Activation of na\u0131\u00a8ve T cells (priming) by APCs within the secondary lymphoid tissue triggers clonal expansion of T cells and a differentiation program that will influence the magnitude and quality of the antitumor immune response, i.e., T-cell effector functions (cytotoxicity, cytokine release, suppression), tissue tropism, and persistence as T effector or T memory cells. Although this is occurring in the LN, these factors are principally predetermined by the innate immune reaction, upstream at the tumor site (or at a vaccination site). The resulting clonally expanded T cells (now highly enriched for tumor antigen specificity) can then exit the LN via the efferent lymph, enter the bloodstream, and traffic more or less efficiently to the tumor site, depending upon the pattern of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors (their ''homing phenotype'') with which they have been programed to express by the DC.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 512, "end": 520, "text": "(Fig. 48", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Na\u0131\u00a8ve T-Cell Activation Requires Two Signals"}, {"text": "the Na\u0131\u00a8ve T Cells in the Lymph Node?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "How Does Antigen from the Tumor Site Reach"}, {"text": "The best understood route for antigen transport to the LN is via DCs, which are able to phagocytose tumor-derived antigens, then migrate via lymphatic vessels to the T-cell zones of draining LN, wherein they can await encounter with a recirculating na\u0131\u00a8ve T cell with specificity for the captured antigen bound to an MHC molecule. For brain tumors, this scenario is complicated by the particularities of CNS cellular composition and anatomy: there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain, and there are no resident DCs in the healthy brain parenchyma. Nevertheless, several different experimental approaches all now confirm that functional antigen drainage from the brain parenchyma to lymphoid tissues occurs, principally to the cervical LNs (Cserr and Knopf, 1992) . 2 T-cell activation in the lymph node. Na\u0131\u00a8ve T cells are activated (primed) in secondary lymphoid tissue by DCs that are able to present tumor antigens (i.e., exogenous antigens) on MHC class I (cross-presentation) and MHC class II molecules to CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively. In addition, all DCs present endogenous antigens to CD8 T cells.

More recently, particulate material was also shown to reach cervical and submandibular LN after intracerebral injection (Walter and Albert, 2007) . These studies confirm functional drainage in the absence of lymphatics, but they do not adequately explain the initiation of adaptive immunity. For this to occur without induction of immune tolerance, there must be not only antigen presented to T cells in the cervical LN but also a second signal indicating danger or infection.

The microglia are the most abundant phagocytes in the brain, and they can be induced to express costimulatory molecules, and they can present antigens to MHC class II restricted CD4 T cells in vitro (Aloisi et al., 2000) . The more demanding function of cross-presentation, i.e., uptake of exogenous antigens and presentation of processed peptides derived therefrom on MHC class I molecules, has only been reported in one in vitro study using ovalbumin as antigen (Beauvillain et al., 2008) . Whether these in vitro results apply to microglia in vivo is debatable, partly because of the criteria used to define microglia, such as morphology, anatomic location, and level of expression of macrophage associated markers, and even function (Davoust et al., 2008) . Indeed, efficient antigen presentation in vitro requires a phenotype and function of a reactive, or activated microglial cell, which is virtually indistinguishable from any activated macrophage. The final function necessary for in vivo initiation of T-cell immunity is migration to the LN.

Many of the underlying concepts of immune cell entry into the CNS are based on CNS autoimmune conditions, principally multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice (Engelhardt, 2006) . This precious information may also apply to cerebral malignancies but will require validation. Indeed, there is a preponderance of information on CD4 T cells in EAE, but less on CD8 T cells, and furthermore, certain molecular considerations of homing are proposed to be influenced by the mouse strain, and the precise CNS region, factors that have not yet been addressed for tumors. Nevertheless, several key findings do now appear to apply to different strains, species, and neuropathologies (Table 48 .1).

Integrins are expressed as heterodimers and a 4 partners with either b 1 (CD29) or b 7 integrin chains. For the CNS, the a 4 b 1 integrin (also called VLA-4) and its interaction with VCAM-1 on endothelial cells are central. In EAE, a 4 b 1 may facilitate both lower affinity rolling interactions and higher affinity arrest, according to the particular CNS microvasculature involved (Engelhardt, 2006) . In mouse brain tumor models, a 4 b 1 integrin was also shown to be a key molecule for T-cell entry to the tumor site. We found that high levels of a 4 b 1 integrin are induced on tumor-specific CD4 T cells (PRW and PYD unpublished data) and CD8 T cells (Calzascia et al., 2005) , when they are primed by endogenous APC in the cervical LN of brain tumor-bearing mice. This was functionally relevant since a 4 -specific blocking antibody significantly reduced brain entry of these T cells. Further exploration of the role of integrins in brain tropism has been performed on CD8 T cells polarized toward different cytokine-secreting profiles. Mouse CD8 T cells with a type 1 profile (IFN-g-secreting) expressed higher levels of a 4 b 1 integrin and trafficked to the brain more efficiently than type 2, interleukin (IL)-4 secreting CD8 T cells . This finding is particularly relevant for brain tumor immunotherapy, since T cells receiving the same in vitro or in vivo stimuli can manifest two key characteristics for efficacious antitumor function: appropriate tissue tropism and cytokine expression. The same key a 4 b 1 integrin is also implicated in CNS entry of T cells in humans. Patients with MS receiving a novel treatment in which a 4 integrins were targeted using the humanized antibody natalizumab had reduced levels of inflammatory leukocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid, and generally showed some clinical improvement (Stuve et al., 2006) . Taken together, the results from these different studies unequivocally establish an important role for a 4 b 1 integrin in T-cell homing to the CNS. However, this should not be interpreted to mean that a 4 b 1 specifically targets T cells to the brain, since most of the studies have analyzed a single tissue, the brain. Rather, it is likely that if a 4 b 1 integrin is abundantly expressed by a T cell; this molecule can facilitate entry to the CNS. Nevertheless, since the inhibition or blocking of a 4 b 1 does not totally abrogate T cell entry to the CNS, other molecules are probably also involved and may either substitute for or synergize with a 4 b 1 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 522, "end": 540, "text": "(Engelhardt, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 796, "end": 820, "text": "(Calzascia et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1989, "text": "(Stuve et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of Integrins in CNS Tropism"}, {"text": "To date, there are mixed findings for the involvement of non-integrin adhesion molecules in T-cell entry to the CNS.

However, in vivo experiments with blocking antibodies and CXCR3 deficient mice have yielded conflicting results, probably because CXCR3 influences EAE at multiple levels (e.g., IFN-g production) and not just at the level of trafficking. Similar considerations exist for CCR5 and its ligand CCL5, which are suggested to have roles in CNS viral infection (including West Nile virus, HIV, and coronavirus) but probably relate to T-cell function rather than trafficking. Another chemokine receptor expressed on T cells, CCR7, and its ligands CCL19 and CCL21 may have multiple roles in CNS pathologies. The cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS and brain lesions of mice with progressive EAE accumulate CCR7-expressing T cells. Moreover, in addition, two ligands of CCR7, CCL19 and CCL21, are expressed at the BBB in brain of mice with EAE and at least in vitro, can mediate adhesion of CCR7 + T cells.

Nevertheless, the level of infiltration of tumor-specific T cells will be a factor that will limit the efficacy of immunotherapies. Many current tumor T-cell immunotherapy protocols are adapted directly from therapies being tested for tumors in other sites, and yet the tumor pathology is fundamentally different. The lethality of most extracranial tumors is due to metastases, and the goal of T-cell immunotherapy will be that therapeutic T cells can reach the many sites of tumor dissemination. For primary CNS malignancies such as malignant glioma, the situation is different; these tumors are unique in oncology because they very rarely metastasize from their tissue of origin. The immunological problem for such tumors is thus strictly one of regional immunity. Thus, promoting efficient brain tropism of protective immune cells will undoubtedly benefit future glioma immunotherapies. For this it will be necessary to not only understand and induce the key molecules for T cell-entry to the CNS but also avoid induction of a homing phenotype that may lead to their entrapment elsewhere (for example, the mucosal surfaces if there is high a 4 b 7 and CCR9 expression). In this regard, preclinical models in which multiple sites are studied will be helpful (Calzascia et al., 2005) , for which the emerging technology of whole body imaging will be particularly appropriate (Prins et al., 2008b) . A further refinement would be to ensure infiltration of only protective T cells, since a gross augmentation of any inflammatory infiltrate will be inappropriate and dangerous for the brain.

This occurs in some preclinical brain tumor models, and to date, possibly for a minority of malignant cells forming the intracranial tumor mass in patients with glioma. If the CD8 T cell has been fully activated in the periphery, the tumor cell needs only to express MHC class I/peptide (costimulatory molecules are not essential at the effector stage) for it to become a CTL target. Cytotoxicity occurs by the polarized exocytosis of the contents of cytotoxic granules into the immunological synapse formed between the CTL and the tumor target, and it is exquisitely specific, with no bystander killing. The granule contents include perforin and granulysin that perturb the tumor cell membrane and serine proteases known as granzymes that induce tumor cell death mainly through caspase-dependent pathways. Secondary cytotoxic mechanisms also exist, through cell-associated or cell-secreted cytotoxic molecules, including Fas ligand (CD95L), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and lymphotoxins (LTs). Antitumor effects can also be mediated by CD8 T cells after indirect recognition of tumor derived antigenic peptides on MHC class I molecules of an APC, i.e., by cross-presentation. As already discussed, the role of APCs in priming CD8 T-cell responses in the LN is essential, but they may also have a role at the effector stage of the response. Indeed, local APCs can potentially amplify T-cell-mediated antitumor effects occurring at a low level after direct T celltumor cell contact (Karman et al., 2006; Masson et al., 2007) , or they may substitute for this contact in the absence of direct antigen presentation by the tumor cell, for example, because of MHC downregulation.

Indeed, we observed retention of tumor-specific CD8 T cells in the brain in a mouse model designed to address the issue of cross-presentation . In this model, intracranially implanted MT539MG astrocytoma cells were unable to directly present a defined tumor antigen, and so the presentation of this tumor antigen to T cells in the brain was occurring solely through cross-presentation, although the identity of the APC in this study was not determined.

T regs function by an array of cell contact and cytokinemediated mechanisms to suppress T cells, B cells, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs at both the induction and effector stages of immune responses. In the context of malignancy, T regs accumulate in many tumors, including human glioma (El Andaloussi and Lesniak, 2007; Fecci et al., 2006a; Hussain et al., 2006) , and T reg depletion or inhibition in murine brain tumor models can reveal spontaneous tumor immunity, or enhance induced immunity (Curtin et al., 2008; El Andaloussi et al., 2006; Fecci et al., 2006b; Grauer et al., 2007) . While the importance of T reg in the antiglioma immune response is widely accepted, there are many challenges in identifying and modulating these cells. Foremost is the lack of a unique marker to identify T regs . Most markers are shared with activated effector T cells (e.g., CD25), and the best specific T reg marker in mice (the transcription factor Foxp3) is intracellular (and so inaccessible to antibodies in vivo), and expression is not restricted to T reg in human T cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 204, "text": "(Sakaguchi et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1037, "text": "(El Andaloussi and Lesniak, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1058, "text": "Fecci et al., 2006a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1080, "text": "Hussain et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1234, "text": "(Curtin et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1262, "text": "El Andaloussi et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1283, "text": "Fecci et al., 2006b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1304, "text": "Grauer et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunosuppressive Cells"}, {"text": "Advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the induction of an immune effector response against the tumor, and how it may sometimes be compromised, is only possible if we are able to define the specificity of tumor immunity.

Furthermore, recent progress in our understanding of tumor immunology can link the information generated from gene-expression profiling of CNS tumors to the identification of precise immunogenic epitopes that can serve as useful targets for specific immunotherapy (Freije et al., 2004) . For instance, since T cells can only recognize antigens in the context of MHC, tumor-associated genes can be scrutinized for amino acid sequences that can interact with relevant MHC molecules and efficiently bind via the proteosomal degradation system. Candidate tumor-specific peptide epitopes for CTLs can now be identified using available computer algorithms that predict the MHC binding affinities of specific peptide and epitope sequences (http://bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/ hla_bind/, http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/kxi/). By subsequently testing the stability of MHC molecules with candidate tumor-specific peptides in vitro, an estimation of the potential immunogenicity of an in silico-identified antigen can be determined (Maecker et al., 2001) . The immunogenicity of human cancer genes or their predicted CTL peptide epitopes can also be assessed in animal models using HLA transgenic mice (Butterfield et al., 2001) , providing even better estimates for immunotherapy targets in vivo.

This approach was not clinically applicable until the discovery of IL-2 and other cytokines that modulate T-cell growth and survival. Before that time, it was not possible to obtain sufficient numbers of immune cells and maintain them in culture during the in vitro sensitization period. IL-2, originally called T-cell growth factor, is a cytokine that mediates lymphocyte activation and stimulates division.

Adoptive Transfer The introduction into the patient or animal of biological material (usually cells) of autologous, syngeneic, or allogeneic origin. For tumor immunotherapy, adoptive transfer offers the possibility of administering cells enriched for specific cell types (e.g., CTLs) or specificities (e.g., for tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens) by appropriate in vitro stimulation and expansion. T-cell activation Resting T cells do not proliferate and exert their immunological functions (cytotoxicity, cytokine release) until their TCRs engage their cognate ligand (antigenic peptide associated with an MHC molecule). The initial antigen-specific activation of mature T cells is referred to as priming and requires particularly stringent conditions to occur. These are generally only achieved by professional APCs (e.g., DCs) which express costimulatory molecules in addition to MHC-peptide complexes. The optimal and most clearly understood conditions for T cell priming are in secondary lymphoid tissues. The conditions for subsequent activation of a T cell that has already been primed (i.e., in a secondary immune response, sometimes referred to as re-activation or re-stimulation) are less demanding and can be achieved by various cell types (including tumor cells) that express the appropriate MHC-peptide complex, without costimulation, and in nonlymphoid tissues including the CNS. Allogeneic The cells, tissues, and histocompatibility molecules derived from a genetically different individual (cf. syngeneic, allogeneic). Anergy A T cell (or a B cell) that is unable to respond to its specific antigen.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "One way in which this may occur is when antigen is initially presented in the absence of costimulatory molecules; this can limit autoimmune reactions but may also limit antitumor reactions. Antigens Material that can be recognized by the T and B lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system via their antigen receptors. The portion of the material that bound by the antigen receptors is the epitope (see also tumorspecific and tumor-associated antigens) Antigen processing and presentation Antigen processing and presentation are divided into three major categories. In the first, exogenous antigens in the extracellular milieu such as cellular debris and opsonised microbes are taken up by antigen presenting cells (APCs), then degraded within acidic endosomes to generate short peptides, certain of which bind to MHC class II molecules and reach the cell surface to be recognized by CD4 T cells. In the second major route, endogenous antigens (i.e., normal, viral, or aberrant proteins synthesized within the cell) are degraded by the proteasome within the cytosol then transported into the endoplasmic reticulum wherein peptide binding to MHC class I molecules can occur, followed by transport to the cell surface for recognition by CD8 T cells. A third category of antigen presentation called cross-presentation is important in tumor immunology and immunotherapy. Cross-presentation is the pathway in which exogenous antigen is taken up by professional APCs, then processed (degraded into short peptides) and presented at the cell surface bound to MHC class I molecules. The most important cell responsible for cross-presentation is the DC. Crosspresentation is particularly important when malignant transformation occurs in parenchymal cells, rather than in professional APCs. For CD8 T cells to be alerted to such threats requires the intervention of an adjacent professional APC such as a DC, which can acquire material derived from the transformed cell (e.g., from dying cells or cellular debris) and cross-present this exogenous antigen to activate na\u0131\u00a8ve CD8 T cells. Tumor vaccines used in immunotherapy need to exploit the cross-presentation pathway in order to activate tumor-specific CD8 T cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abbreviations"}, {"text": "Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) Cells capable of presenting peptide antigens bound to MHC molecules to T cells. The so-called professional APCs (DCs, macrophages, B cells) also express costimulatory molecules and are capable of activating na\u0131\u00a8ve T cells. The most potent professional APCs are the DCs which (unlike the other professional APCs) have no other major biological function. Autoimmunity A T-or B-cell mediated response directed against antigens of the individuals own body. B cells or B-lymphocytes Lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system that develop in the bone marrow, which express clonally distributed antigen receptors, and which are stimulated by antigen in secondary lymphoid organs to differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies. Costimulatory molecules and signals For activation of na\u0131\u00a8ve T cells, they must receive a first signal from MHC-peptide antigen, and a second costimulatory signal delivered by costimulatory molecules on the APC. CD80 and CD86 are major costimulatory molecules on APC, which bind to CD28 on T cells, which then transduces a costimulatory signal to the cell. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) Fully activated CD8 T cells able to kill target cells expressing their cognate MHC-peptide antigen. A major cytotoxic mechanism (shared by NK cells) is the polarized release of the contents of lytic granules stored within the effector cell directly onto a target cell (e.g., a tumor cell). The principle cytotoxic molecules are perforin, granzymes, and granulysin, and they function by inducing apoptosis in the target cell. Other cytotoxic mechanisms can include cell surface molecules such as Fas ligand, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor. Dendritic Cells (DCs) The most efficient professional APCs, of bone marrow origin, which have a branched, dendritic morphology. They fulfill different functions according to their differentiation state. In nonlymphoid tissues, DCs are efficient at phagocytosing and processing antigens and are termed immature. Upon activation via receptors such as TLRs, DCs become mature and migrate to secondary lymphoid tissue, they express high levels of costimulatory and MHC molecules, and they efficiently activate na\u0131\u00a8ve T cells. Epitope The part of an antigen that is bound by an antibody molecule (a B-cell epitope), or that can bind to an MHC molecule and stimulate T cells (a T-cell epitope). HLA transgenic mice Transgenic mice that express a human histocompatibility molecule. These models allow in vivo studies of mouse T-cell immune responses specific for antigens defined in humans of the same HLA-type. Immunological Synapse The immunological synapse is the stable interface between a T cell and target cell presenting cognate MHC peptide. It forms through cell-cell interaction of adhesion and signaling molecules. Polarized release of cytokines or cytotoxic molecules into the space formed at the synapse can ensure antigen specificity of T-cell effector function even when mediated by antigen non-specific molecules.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abbreviations"}, {"text": "Innate Immunity Host immune defenses that react rapidly to infection or danger by means of germline-encoded pattern or pathogen recognition receptors. In contrast to adaptive immune responses, innate improve responses do not become more efficient upon repeat exposure to the original stimulus. Lymphocytes A class of mononuclear leukocytes capable of migrating in blood, lymph, lymphoid, and nonlymphoid tissues according to their state of activation or differention. The small lymphocytes of the blood encompass the B and T cells of the adaptive immune system, which bear clonally distributed antigen receptors. Mature lymphocytes are termed na\u0131\u00a8ve before they are stimulated by antigen. Large granular lymphocytes are the NK cells of the innate immune system. Lymphoid Organs Primary lymphoid organs are the organized tissues where lymphocytes are formed, i.e., the bone marrow (for B cells) and the thymus (for T cells). The secondary lymphoid organs are the main site of encounter between APC and na\u0131\u00a8ve T and B lymphocytes, and subsequent lymphocyte activation. The principal secondary lymphoid tissues are the spleen, lymph nodes (LNs), and the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (such as the tonsils and Peyer's patches). Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) A cluster of genes encoding MHC molecules, a family of polymorphic cell surface glycoproteins called HLA molecules in humans, which are responsible for presenting peptide antigens to T cells. MHC class I molecules present peptides to CD8 T cells and are constitutively expressed on most cells of the body (but notably, are absent or at low levels on astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons). MHC class II molecules are mainly expressed on professional APCs and present peptide antigens to CD4 T cells. Macrophages and microglial cells Macrophages are a family of large mononuclear phagocytes that can exist in many forms in different tissues and pathologies. They derive from blood monocytes which are in turn derived from the bone marrow. They can function as APCs (although they do not migrate to lymphoid tissue like DCs), they can exert effector functions against pathogens and tumors, but they can also promote tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Macrophages associated with the CNS can be distinguished according to the compartment in which they are found. Macrophages in the perivascular space, the leptomeninges, and the choroid plexus are phenotypically very similar to other tissue macrophages. Macrophages of the brain parenchyma on the other hand express only low levels of most classical macrophage markers under non-inflammatory conditions and have a ramified morphology. These cells are referred to as microglial cells, and upon activation they can differentiate to acquire macrophage phenotype and function and may even express the DC marker CD11c under some conditions. Natural Killer (NK) Cells These cells are large, granular, cytotoxic lymphocytes, but unlike the T and B lymphocytes, they mediate innate immune responses. Their most important functions are cytotoxicity and IFN-g secretion, which are regulated by the balance of signals transduced through activating and inhibitory receptors expressed at the NK cell surface. Pathogen/Pattern Recognition Receptors These receptors are germline encoded and detect conserved patterns present on pathogens, as well as material from stressed or dying cells. Cells of the innate immune system always express some of these receptors, but they are present on other cell types as well. They include the toll-like receptors (TLRs). Serological Identification of Antigens by Expression Cloning (SEREX) A technique by which patient antibodies from serum can be used to screen tumor cell proteins for those which elicit immune responses. A cDNA expression library is initially made of a tumor. This library is subsequently probed in an unbiased fashion with autologous patient serum to search for tumor proteins that elicit host immune responses. Syngeneic The cells, tissues, and histocompatibility molecules derived from a genetically identical individual (cf. syngeneic, allogeneic), such as an identical twin, or fully inbred strains of laboratory animals. T Cells or T lymphocytes Lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system that mature in the thymus from bone marrow-derived progenitors, which express clonally distributed antigen receptors, and which are stimulated by APC in secondary lymphoid organs to express different effector functions. The two major populations of T cells are based on the expression of CD4 or CD8 cell surface glycoproteins. CD4 T cells recognize peptide antigen associated with MHC class II molecules and are subdivided into subsets based largely on cytokine secretion profiles for the T-helper cells: T h 1 (IFN-g), T h 2 (IL-4), and T h 17 (IL-17). For T reg , the definition is based on a range of phenotypic markers (including Foxp3) and function (suppression of other immune cells). CD8 T cells recognize peptides bound to MHC class I molecules and generally have cytotoxic potential (see CTLs) but can also secrete cytokines (especially IFN-g). T-Cell Receptor for antigen (TCR) A highly variable receptor expressed exclusively by T cells, in a clonally distributed manner. It is not germline encoded but is generated by somatic rearrangement of gene segments. The ligand is a short peptide epitope bound to an MHC molecule expressed at the surface of another cell. Tolerance Immunological tolerance refers to the unresponsiveness of T and B cells to a particular antigen. Central tolerance is established in the bone marrow for B cells and in the thymus for T cells, wherein cell highly reactive with self-antigens (autoreactive cells) can be eliminated. Residual populations of autoreactive cells that escape deletion are restrained by different mechanisms of peripheral tolerance. Tumor immunotherapy often aims to exploit these cells that may react to tumor expressed TAAs and may thus need to attempt to ''break'' tolerance. Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). These antigens are expressed by malignant cells but also by normal cells. They may still be useful targets for immunotherapy because tumor cells may express the TAA at a higher level than normal tissue, or because normal cells express the TAA only at a certain stage of development, or in specific sites that may be shielded from immune attack (e.g., the so-called cancer-testis antigens). These antigens may be common to many patients, facilitating defined targeting and immune monitoring. However, since TAAs are self-antigens, it may be difficult to induce effective immune responses because of partial or complete immunological tolerance, and if this is overcome, there is a risk of inducing autoimmune pathology. Tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) These antigens are only expressed by malignant cells (e.g., following mutations). They present advantages for immunotherapy because the patient should have no central tolerance to these antigens, and there is no risk of immune effector mechanisms damaging normal tissues because they do not express the antigen. However, many of these antigens are unique to individual patients, meaning that defined targeting and immune monitoring would need to be personalized.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abbreviations"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Combined immunostimulation and conditional cytotoxic gene therapy provide long-term survival in a large glioma model", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Ali", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["D"], "last": "King", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Curtin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Candolfi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Xiong", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Liu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Puntel", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Q", "middle": [], "last": "Cheng", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Prieto", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Ribas", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Kupiec-Weglinski", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Van Rooijen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Lassmann", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Lowenstein", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Castro", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Cancer Res", "volume": "65", "issn": "", "pages": "7194--204", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Regulation of T-cell responses by CNS antigenpresenting cells: different roles for microglia and astrocytes", "authors": [{"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Aloisi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Ria", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Adorini", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2000, "venue": "Immunol Today", "volume": "21", "issn": "", "pages": "141--148", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Spontaneous cytotoxic T-cell responses against survivin-derived MHC class Irestricted T-cell epitopes in situ as well as ex vivo in cancer patients", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Andersen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": ["O"], "last": "Pedersen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Capeller", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Brocker", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Becker", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Thor", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2001, "venue": "Cancer Res", "volume": "61", "issn": "", "pages": "5964--68", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Dendritic cells pulsed with tumor extract-cationic liposome complex increase the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in mouse brain tumor", "authors": [{"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Aoki", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Mizuno", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Natsume", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Tsugawa", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Tsujimura", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Takahashi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Yoshida", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2001, "venue": "Cancer Immunol Immunother", "volume": "50", "issn": "", "pages": "463--471", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Immune stimulatory effects of CD70 override CD70-mediated immune cell apoptosis in rodent glioma models and confer long-lasting antiglioma immunity in vivo", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Aulwurm", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Wischhusen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Friese", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Borst", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Weller", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "Int J Cancer", "volume": "118", "issn": "", "pages": "1728--1763", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Ex vivo expansion of tumor-draining lymph node cells using compounds which activate intracellular signal transduction.
