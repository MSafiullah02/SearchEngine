In principle, the system consists of a translation competent cell-lysate supplemented with ER-derived membrane vesicles referred to as microsomes (5), and a synthetic protein-encoding RNA. The cell-free translation system has been found to accurately reproduce the steps involved in translation, translocation, as well as co- and posttranslational protein modifications that occur in vivo and therefore has become a standard assay system to study those processes. Because secretory as well as transmembrane proteins were found to use the same translocation machinery in the ER membrane (3,6,7), the lysate system proved suitable to study both types of proteins.",

In addition, the system is readily accessible to scientific manipulations. Other advantages of this method include speed, a relative ease to interpret results because only one or a small number of known RNA species are present and will be translated, simple detection of the synthesized radiolabeled proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, no detectable endogenous protease activity, and a wide range of co- and post-translational protein modifications, as the system is derived from eukaryotic cells. The system, however, is not suitable for the production of large quantities of protein. Yields of protein obtained with this method will be only in the picomole range. In addition, the standard cell-free translation system will not allow the study of processes occurring in intracellular compartments downstream of the ER, although a modification of the method has been described in which the microsomal vesicles are replaced by detergent-permeabilized whole cells (8). Transport through the Golgi apparatus, as well as insertion into the plasma membrane, was observed in this modified system.",

            "text": "Synthetic RNAs can be synthesized as capped, as well as uncapped RNAs. While capping is required for transfection of mammalian cells (13), uncapped RNAs will be translated efficiently in the lysate system. A somewhat higher translation efficiency of capped RNAs is in general compensated by the more efficient synthesis of uncapped RNAs. Poly(A) tails are also not required for efficient translation in lysate systems.\nAlthough the vectors contain a transcription termination signal downstream of the cloning site, linearization of the plasmid downstream of the inserted cDNA is desirable and substantially increases the yield of RNA copies. Standard procedures for synthetic RNA synthesis are supplied in Promega Biotech\u2019s Technical Manual \u201cTranscription in vitro Systems\u201d (part no. TM016).\nA typical transcription reaction used for the synthesis of connexin cRNAs (14\u201316) is as follows (see\nNote 2): 10 \u03bcL of 5\u00d7 transcription buffer 5 \u03bcLof 0.1M DTT 10 \u03bcLof2.5mM rNTPs 1 \u03bcL of 1 mg/mL of acetylated BSA 1 U/\u03bcL of transcription volume RNasin 0.3 U/\u03bcL of transcription volume SP6-polymerase 0.1\u20131 \u03bcg of linearized plasmid DNA Water to 50 \u03bcLMix at room temperature and incubate at least 1 h at 40\u00b0C.If the synthetic RNA is to be synthesized with a 5\u2032 CAP structure, only the concentration of rGTP is decreased fivefold, and 1 \u03bcLof1 mM CAP analog (m7G[5\u2032]ppp[5\u2032]G) (Pharmacia) is added to the transcription protocol given previously.Synthesized RNAs can be used without further purification in following translation reactions. However, if additional background bands appear on the gels, phenolchloroform purification, followed by ethanol precipitation (17) is recommended (see\nNote 3).Efficiency of RNA synthesis, and quality of the RNA transcripts can be checked by electrophoresing a small aliquot (1\u20132 \u03bcL) on a freshly prepared standard agarose gel prepared with TAE or Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer. To recognize the newly synthesized RNA on the gel and to avoid confusion with the linearized DNA that was used as a template and is also present in the transcription reaction, a lane containing linearized plasmid alone should be electrophoresed as a control in parallel as well.RNA can be visualized by standard ethidium bromide staining (17) (see\nNote 4).\n",

Reticulocyte lysate is prepared from the red blood cells of rabbits that have been injected with phenylhydrazine to destroy their mature red blood cells, and wheat germ extract is prepared from sprouting wheat seeds. Both extracts are depleted of endogenous RNAs and produce only minimal amounts of endogenous proteins. However, it is always advisable to run a control translation reaction without adding any synthetic RNA with each new batch of lysate. Translation in wheat germ lysates is sensitive to the concentration of potassium and magnesiumions and their concentration has to be optimized for each RNA. For most RNAs optimal potassium ion concentrations range from 120\u2013160 mM, and optimal magnesium ion concentrations range from 1.5 to 4 mM.

A careful analysis of the cleavage reaction revealed that the relatively weak hydrophobic character of the first transmembrane spanning domain, which acts as internal signal anchor sequence, is responsible for this inappropriate cleavage. Our results indicate that the connexin signal anchor sequence is aberrantly recognized and positioned as a cleavable signal peptide within the endoplasmic reticulum translocon, and that this mispositioning enabled signal peptidase to access the cleavage sites (16). These observations provide direct evidence for the involvement of yet uncharacterized cellular factors in the membrane integration process of connexins that are absent or inactive in the standard cell-free translation system (14,16).\n\n",

After the digest is completed protected polypeptide domains can be characterized by immunoprecipitation analysis using domain- specific antipeptide antibodies (ref.\n14, and Subheading 3.3.2.).",

This approach is based on the activity of oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) that is present in the lumen of the ER and within microsomes. The enzyme transfers mannose-rich carbohydrate moieties onto asparagine residues that are part of N-glycosylation consensus sequences (Asp/X/Ser or Thr) (30). Since glycosylation can occur only at sites located at the lumenal face of the ER (or the microsomes), glycosylation at any given site can be taken as proof of the ER lumenal localization (which coincides with the extracellular face) of that polypeptide domain. Each core glycosylation group added to the polypeptide chain increases its molecular mass by ir~2.5 kDa. The accompanying reduction in electrophoretic mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels is generally large enough to be readily visible with proteins up to ir70 kDa in size.",

In general, between 2000 and 15,000 counts per minute (cpm) are obtained per 5S peak fraction.The cpm recorded in each fraction are corrected by the background activity (fraction with the lowest cpm), and plotted in percent activity per fraction (Fig. 7).Aliquots of all fractions are also analyzed by immunoprecipitation (see\nSubheading 3.3.2.) using connexin-specific antibodies.To verify assembly of connexins into connexons, control aliquots of the translocation reactions are solubilized in 0.1% SDS to resolve the oligomeric assemblies and analyzed in parallel as described previously, except that the gradients are prepared with 0.1 % SDS, and run at 20\u00b0C to prevent precipitation of the SDS in the gradients.\nThe refractive index of each fraction is measured using a refractometer and converted into the corresponding sucrose concentrations using a standard conversion table.Standard proteins with known sedimentation coefficients (myoglobin, 2S; ovalbumin, 3.5S; BSA, 4.3S; catalase, 11.5S) and gap junction connexons consisting of \u03b11Cx43, \u03b21Cx32, or \u03b22Cx26 expressed and purified from baculovirus infected insect cells (42) are analyzed on separate gradients to compare the connexin specific S-values with corresponding sucrose concentrations.Dependent on the detergent used for the solubilization of microsomes, up to 32% of the membrane-integrated connexin polypeptides were recovered as hexameric connexons (ref. 15, and Fig. 7).\n",

            "text": "\nBacteriophage RNA polymerases are active for several hours and yield of RNA transcripts increases with longer incubation times.If several different transcripts will be synthesized, it is desirable to mix all components except the individual cDNAs to reduce pipetting steps, then aliquot the mix, and finally add cDNAs.Shorter RNA transcripts (1\u20132 kb in length) can be frozen and thawed several times without significant degradation. Longer transcripts (5\u201310 kb) are best used fresh to avoid degradation by the freeze-thaw cycle.Great care has to be taken to avoid any possible contamination with RNases. Only autoclaved materials should be used, and tubes and pipet tips should not be touched with bare hands. All electrophoresis equipment needs to be cleaned thoroughly immediately before use, and buffers should be prepared fresh to reduce cRNA degradation.When purchased, microsomes are relatively costly. I have prepared microsomes from fresh canine pancreas following the protocol of Walter and Blobel (21) with great success. The prepared microsomes had at least a similar translocation efficiency, and low backgrounds comparable to those of purchased microsomes, and were very efficient in connexin protein integration. Inside-out microsomes were not detected in the preparations (see\nFig.2).Microsomes are quite stable when stored at \u221270\u00b0C (2\u20133 yr). However, they should not be thawed and refrozen more than once or twice. Therefore, when first used, aliquoting them out into smaller volumes is highly recommended.To investigate if the membrane translocation of a protein is dependent on signal recognition particle (SRP) wheat germ extract has to be used as a lysate, in combination with SRP-depleted microsomes and purified SRP. SRPs present in the wheat germ lysate do not interact with mammalian microsomes. Although we have used this methodology to prove that the membrane integration of connexins into microsomes is SRP-mediated (14), details of this specific application are not described in this more general chapter. However, protocols for the high-salt extraction of microsomes and the preparation of SRP are described in several publications by Peter Walter and co-workers (University of California, San Francisco).To reduce background, a highly purified methionine, such as SJ1515 (Amersham Biotech) should be used in the translation reactions. Translabel (ICN) was found to produce additional bands, and therefore should be avoided for this application.To avoid nonspecific aggregation of connexin polypeptides that failed to integrate into microsomes during translation and are detected as a protein band on top of the separating gel, shorter incubation times of only 30\u201345 min are recommended.The posttranslational membrane integration of \u03b11Cx43 and \u03b22Cx26 recently reported by two laboratories (27,28) is solely based on the results obtained by pelleting microsomes through sucrose cushions, and a protease protection assay using an inadequate protease (Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease; see below). Therefore, the observation may reflect a strong adhesion of these connexin isotypes to the outer microsomal membrane surface owing to their strong overall hydrophobicity, rather than real posttranslational membrane translocation. Further experiments using adequate technology (see\nSubheadings 3.2.1.-3.2.3.) and control proteins are required to convincingly demonstrate a posttranslational ER membrane integration of connexin polypeptides.Proteases with a very low specificity, such as proteinase K or trypsin, are recommended for this assay because exposed polypeptide domains should be degraded completely. More specific proteases, such as Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, which cleaves only peptide bonds C-terminally at glutamic acid and with a 3000-fold lower rate at aspartic acid (44) that have been used in connexin protease protection assays previously (44) are not suitable. The large polypeptide fragments generally produced by V8 protease do not make it possible to determine if a detected polypeptide fragment was indeed protected from proteolytic degradation and located inside the microsomal vesicle, or simply did not contain a protease V8 specific cleavage site (see\nref. 47 for further reading).Protease activity has to be blocked completely before the microsomes are resolved in protein sample buffer; otherwise the protected polypeptide fragments will be degraded. This is especially important when the protected fragments will be characterized subsequently by immunoprecipitation. Proteinase K is extremely active, exhibiting residual activity even in protein sample buffer. A combination of either DFP or PMSF, together with SDS, and heating to at least 80\u00b0C as described above was found to efficiently block proteinase K, as well as trypsin activity.The main disadvantage of protease protection assays is that sometimes the protease concentration cannot be increased high enough to obtain a complete digest of exposed polypeptide domains, before encountering leak of protease activity into the lumen of the microsomal vesicles. As a result, exposed but tightly membrane-associated domains may remain undigested. This was observed, for example, with a large portion of the C-terminal domain of the coronavirus glycoprotein E1 (13). Although potentially accessible to proteolytic degradation the intracellular loop region of connexins was found to be relatively resistant to protease digestion (48,49), which resulted in the precipitation of connexin polypep- tide fragments that included the intracellular loop domain in such protease protection assays (see\nFig. 7 in ref. 14). This result intially misled us to believe that the transmembrane topology of connexins integrated into microsomes may be partially inverted (50). The assumption was revised (14), and the correct trans- membrane topology of connexins integrated into microsomes was proven (16).\nPreviously, 3\u20135 mM (final conc.) oxidized gluthatione (GSSG; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) added to the translation reactions was described to promote proper folding of membrane proteins by maintaining oxidized conditions in the translation reactions (34,51). However, addition of GSSG was not found to be necessary for connexon assembly.Several researchers have used chemical crosslinking to detect connexin-connexin interactions (39,41,45). However, because this technique requires a chemical alteration of the polypeptides that may produce misleading results, especially if the concentration of the connexin polypeptides is low compared to the amount of total protein present in the microsomes, this technique was not further developed for the assembly analysis of cell-free expressed connexins.Antibodies are used in combination with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). However, the cleanest immunoprecipitations are obtained with connexin-specific antibodies covalently bound to protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). To link the antibodies to the beads, 1 mL of protein G bead slurry is washed and incubated in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, with 15 mg of monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at room temperature with continuous rocking. Antibody-bead complexes are washed twice in 0.1 M sodium borate, pH 9.0, and bound antibodies are covalently crosslinked to the Protein A with 20 mM dimethyl pimelimidate \u00b7 2HCl (DMP, Pierce, IL), in 0.1 M sodium borate, pH 9.0, for 30 min at room temperature with continuous rocking. The reaction was quenched by washing twice with 0.2 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 1 h. Antibody-bead complexes were resuspended in 1\u00d7 PBS, 0.01% Thimerosal and stored at 4\u00b0C until used.Cell-free expressed connexons were found to be functional by means of channel activity. Single-channel activities were characterized by electrophysiological analysis of channels obtained after fusion of microsomes containing cell-free expressed connexins with planar lipid membranes. This method requires special experimental setup and is not described in this chapter. However, the experimental conditions are described in detail in Buehler et al. (52) and Falk et al. (15).\n",
