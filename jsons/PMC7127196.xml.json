Incineration has become the main method for disposal of hospital solid waste in China since the nation-wide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003(Zhao et al., 2010). It is estimated that currently there are over 300 centralized incinerators and the number is still increasing (Zhao et al., 2008). Although incineration can destroy pathogens and reduce the weight of waste by more than 70%, a large amount of hospital solid waste incinerator (HSWI) fly ash (3% of the original mass) has been generated (Bo et al., 2009). HSWI fly ash contains heavy metals and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), which is classified as hazardous wastes.",

            "text": "Recent reports have shown that the fly ash from HSWI is quite different from that from municipal solid waste incinerator (Bo et al., 2009, Yan et al., 2011). Firstly, hospital solid waste contain more chlorine-containing scrap plastics like polyvinyl chloride compared with municipal solid waste, therefore the HSWI fly ash usually generally has a higher level of chloride and organic pollutants like PCDD/Fs (Wu et al., 2011). The total toxic equivalent (TEQ) values of PCDD/Fs in some HSWI fly ash exceeded 20 ng I-TEQ/g (Chen et al., 2008). In addition, a lot of powder activated carbon was sprayed into exhaust gas before entering a bag filter for absorption of PCDD/Fs from flue gases to meet much more strictly emission regulations of the hospital solid waste incineration (<0.05 ng I-TEQ/Nm3) (Chen et al., 2009). Yan et al. (2007) found that carbon content in some of HSWI fly ash reached the range of 11.40\u201391.0% due to activated carbon injection. Both injected powder activated carbon and unburned carbon in solid waste were identified as the main carbon sources of fly ash (Kakuta et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The characteristic of high chloride and carbon content in HSWI fly ash make the tradition processes such as cementation, melting which are effective for municipal solid waste incinerator fly ash be inefficient for HSWI fly ash. Cementation is the most popular and inexpensive method for stabilizing fly ash, but it is difficult to solidify a HSWI fly ash since chlorides and activated carbon hinder the hydration of cement and bring a decrease of compressive strength (Colangelo et al., 2012, Zheng et al., 2011). Melting can also provide an alternative because it can destroy PCDD/Fs at high temperatures and make various heavy metals inert through their incorporation into the glass matrix. This technique is also limited, however, because most chlorides are too volatile at high temperature over 1000 \u00b0C to be confined into the vitreous products, which causes secondary pollution (Jiang et al., 2009). Meanwhile, high carbon content in fly ash would accelerate the electrode erosion of plasma or arc melting furnace (Liu et al., 2011). Recent reports have found that the water washing pre-treatment for fly ash can reduce undesirable side effect from high chloride in fly ash (Jiang et al., 2009, Zheng et al., 2011, Huang et al., 2011). The appropriate water washing condition is washed twice in distilled water at a liquid-to-solid ratio of 10 or 20 for successful processing (Chiang and Hu, 2010, Liu et al., 2009). However, water washing pre-treatment cannot separate activated carbon from HSWI fly ash.",

Therefore, it is necessary to explore a physical method to separate carbon constituent in HSWI fly ash. The modern floatation technology was introduced to mineral industries in early 18th centuries. At present, the flotation technique has been applied not only in the mineral industry, but also pulp mills, rubber, waste battery, and environment engineers (Naik et al., 2005). Column flotation is a sophisticated froth flotation technique, which has been developed as an alternative to the conventional, mechanically agitated flotation (Finch et al., 1995, Hasan and Hale, 2007). Column flotation is the most effective method of separating the carbonaceous material from coal ash (Altun et al., 2009). Atsushi et al. (2005) found that column flotation can clean up and reduce the PCDD/Fs-contaminated soil by removing selectively unburned carbon including a high PCDD/Fs concentration of incineration fly ash. Huang et al. (2007) successfully used column flotation to remove 64% of the unburned carbon, 41.9% of total PCDD/Fs and 40.8% of coplanar PCBs from MSW incinerator fly ash. These studies mostly pay attention to the removal of unburned carbon from MSW incinerator fly ash, few concern the fate and disposal of the final product after flotation.",

X-ray diffractograms of the raw fly ash and conditioned fly ash are shown in Fig. 1\n. Comparing the two diffractograms, it can be found that large amounts of soluble compounds like NaCl, were removed during the conditioning process. These results are consistent with XRF analysis of raw fly ash and conditioned fly ash. High amount of NaCl which bring on the increasing of electrolyte concentration in the slurry, which will affect zeta potential, the electrical double-layer interaction between bubbles and particles as well as flotation performance (Harvey et al., 2002). The effect of NaCl salt on floatability of carbon constituent needs further study in detail. The weight loss reached about 64% due to solubilization of chloride and at the same time, carbon constituents were concentrated in solid phase during the conditioning process, the two results caused LOI of the conditioned fly ash to increase to 31.6%. The change of weight loss and LOI may also have noteworthy effect on the subsequent flotation.",

Therefore, 0.05 kg/l was determined as the slurry concentration, taking the flotation performance and water conservation into consideration.

However, differences in the carbon removal and LOI in the tailings were not observed when the kerosene dosage exceeded 12 kg/t. Accordingly, the optimal kerosene dosage was 12 kg/t. The collector amount is high compared with the coal fly ash and MSW incinerator fly ash (Eisele and Kawatra, 2002, Huang et al., 2003b), there are two reasons for this result, one is that the high-carbon ash required a significantly higher collector and frother dosage than did the low-carbon ash, the other one is related with the extended surface area, micro-porous structure and high adsorption capacity of the activated carbon particles that soaks up much of the reagents.",

This trend is similar to the observations reported by Hacifazlioglu and Sutcu (2007).The reason is that there was turbulence through the column axial and the froth balanced was disturbed at excessive air flow rate.

There is a high carbon removal compared with the removal of unburned carbon from MSW incinerator fly ash (Huang et al., 2003b). Since the surfaces of the unburned carbon particles are commonly oxidized, which tend to reduce their natural hydrophobicity. After weathering of MSWI fly ash, more oxygen-containing functional groups on the unburned carbon surface easily came into being and accordingly made them more difficult to remove by froth flotation (Huang et al., 2003b). In addition, powder activated carbon in HSWI fly ash is naturally hydrophobic due to their hydrocarbon nature and this hydrophobicity increases with an increase in carbon content.",

The total PCDD/Fs in the raw fly ash after flotation was decreased from 78.8 ng/g to 16.7 ng/g in the tailings. We extrapolated that the reason is the PCDD/Fs are hydrophobe and easily captured by kerosene and carried upward by gas bubbles during flotation process. In addition, PCDD/Fs may also be removed following to powder activated carbon because PCDD/Fs have a considerable tendency to adsorb on the surface of porous activated carbon. The TEQ of the raw fly ash was decreased from 5.61 ng-TEQ/g to 1.47 ng-TEQ/g in the tailings, which is less than 3 ng-TEQ/g. In general, the ratios of PCDD/Fs dissolved in the aqueous phase are much lower than those in the froth and residue, because the PCDD/Fs are strongly hydrophobic. Therefore, the PCDD/Fs were enriched into froth products. These results indicate that the flotation process can be successfully applied to reduce substantially the amount of carbon constituents and the PCDD/Fs in HSWI fly ash.",

Generally, HSWI fly ash needs to be detoxified by treatment prior to landfill. By employing column flotation, PCDD/Fs and carbon constituents will be enriched and separated from HSWI fly ash, at the same time chloride will be washed out. After separation, the froth product could be subject to further treatment such as recirculation in the combustion chamber of incinerator, which can serve a dual purpose: almost complete destruction of the toxic organics pollution such as PCDD/Fs and energy recycling by recovery of combustible part (Samwel et al., 2011). The volume and toxicity of the tailings would be decreased greatly, therefore, the tailings could be directly landfill disposed. Additionally, the flotation column is simple and easy to operate, requires only electricity, cheap and commercially available reagents and eventually water, which would greatly reduce the operating costs in an industrial situation. Among them, the total energy consumption of the flotation column system is below 4 kW/ton of fly ash, and the water consumption can be reduced by recycling some of waste water (Altun et al., 2009). On the contrary, melting technology involves extensive equipment and high energy input. Cementation of HSWI fly ash need above 40% of cement and 20\u201330% of water added unless dechlorinating (Liu et al., 2010). Therefore, the technological and economic advantages of floatation are over the conventional methods such as melting and cementation.",

LOI of the fly ash rapidly increase because of solubilization of large amounts of NaCl by conditioning during the slurry preparation process. The optimum flotation conditions were found as follows: slurry concentration 0.05 kg/l, kerosene dosage 12 kg/t, frother dosage 3 kg/t, air flow rate 0.06 m3/h. Under these conditions, a froth product with 92.7% carbon constituents\u2019 removal and a tailings product with less than 5% of LOI carbon were obtained. After flotation, the froth product is enriched with the PCDD/Fs and has calorific values of 12.5 MJ/kg, which make it suitable for recirculation as fuel of the incinerator and realization the decomposition of PCDD/Fs. At the same time, the TEQ of PCDD/Fs in remaining fly ash could be decreased to lower than the standard of landfill site of municipal solid waste (3 ng-TEQ/g). It was confirmed that applying flotation process can simultaneously remove carbon constituents and PCDD/Fs from HSWI fly ash. Moreover, flotation technology has relatively low operating costs, which make it be one of the most promising alternatives for the treatment of HSWI fly ash.",
