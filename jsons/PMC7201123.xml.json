All faculty and fellows were trained emergently to perform virtual medicine through video and phone visits. Our inpatient consult service changed shape as well; the requested consults ran through an algorithm based on the need for physical examination, and the risk to COVID-19. Faculty volunteered in COVID-19 telemedicine clinics, which provided a unique opportunity to augment our typical curriculum evolving COVID-19 guidelines. The insight gained was tremendously helpful, not only for referring potential COVID-19 cases but also for understanding the impact of this infection on allergic conditions. The changes and strategies implemented by our division are summarized in Table I.",

Previous reviews have found that supervision using telehealth can be an effective method of clinical training.1\n,\n2 Both faculty and fellows were trained and provided with adequate information technology support. Faculty, who had previous experience with telemedicine visits, supervised the fellow\u2019s telehealth training. Fellows were instructed via university-provided Web-based sessions, through both prerecorded and live interactive sessions, on virtual visits. After these tutorials, fellows were directed to use the virtual hospital desktop. The virtual desktop can be accessed remotely by their office or home computer, in conjunction with a smartphone- or tablet-based video-conferencing application to perform visits. After Web-based tutorial training was completed, the fellow\u2019s first virtual visit occurred in a cleaned patient room while the patient was at home. These ad-hoc offices improved social distancing for the fellows. After the review, the supervising attending allergist joined the patient and fellow in a concluding group virtual visit. The first virtual visits allowed the supervising allergist to help the fellow navigate the electronic medical record, trouble shoot, and fix any problem in person. Once the fellow was comfortable, we allowed fellows to work from home.",

These factors include overloading of the daily clinic schedule with telemedicine training, the rapid publication of key COVID-19 articles, and social distancing. To address these challenges, the weekly calendar was revised. The training program created a new detailed, shared calendar to follow and document all the fellows\u2019 educational and clinical activities. The new calendar reduced scheduling conflicts. Given the rapidly developing crisis and publication of important findings, journal club required an expansion. An online, expanded journal club schedule was embedded in the above schedule. Faculty and fellows were assigned to cover allergy- and immunology-related articles with focus on COVID-19. Example was a 90-minute journal club through which 5 fellows thoroughly discussed the new practice parameters guidelines on COVID-19 pandemic contingency planning published by the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.4 This journal club was followed by a divisional meeting to reinforce some of the changes that needed to be implemented in our clinical practice according to this publication. Similarly, social distancing required the in-person discussing of interesting or challenging cases be transformed to conference calls, with emphasis on cases related to COVID-19 infection.",

As schools and daycares closed, those with young children faced difficulties to coordinate their personal lives. Unfortunately, grandparents were the high-risk population and not suitable babysitters in the COVID-19 pandemic. Performing telehealth visits, or participating in remote journal club, immunology lectures, and training sessions from home was not always easy. We addressed these issues with provisional planning and changing schedules whenever needed. The fear and uncertainty of the unfolding pandemic was particularly unsettling for fellows in training. An open dialog was essential to allow trainees to voice concerns regarding how this national emergency may impact their individual experience. The availability of program directors and their rapport with fellows to address their concerns and provide reassurance on an almost daily basis were essential and helpful to address some of these challenges. Some other changes were made in response to fellows\u2019 concerns. For example, the traditional call schedules were reordered to share the responsibilities, and messages and phone calls were placed in clinical pools as the volume of patient questions increased in the face of the pandemic.",

Given the recent history of other epidemics (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1, ebola, and Middle East respiratory syndrome), it is unlikely that this will be the last epidemic/pandemic crisis. This type of crisis requires allergy divisions and training programs communicate by virtual global assemblies. Communication between program directors and fellows across different programs can provide support and solutions, which can be adapted at each division on the basis of their needs and resources. The entire specialty should unite with the societies such as the World Allergy Organization, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology in these difficult times to share experiences and knowledge to overcome present and future difficulties.",
