Common indications for lung transplantation are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Other less common indications include end-stage sarcoidosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis/granulomatosis (PLCH/G), and other interstitial lung diseases. Either single or bilateral lung transplantation can be performed. Bilateral transplantation is required for patients with suppurative lung diseases including cystic fibrosis and most patients with PAH. While suitable outcomes may be achieved with single lung transplantation for other diagnoses, there is a trend in recent years for use of bilateral transplantation, largely related to a suggestion of better long-term survival seen in registry data [1] . Specifically, according to the 2014 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) registry report, the median survival for all adult recipients is 5.7 years, but bilateral lung recipients appear to have a better median survival than single lung recipients (7 versus 4.5 years, respectively) [1] . Overall survival after lung transplantation has improved due to refinement in surgical technique, improvement in organ procurement and preserving techniques, and advances in medical management and immunosuppression. The most common cause of mortality in first 30 days after lung transplantation is primary graft dysfunction.

CT protocols should be tailored to suspected complications such as performing inspiration and expiration CT when chronic allograft dysfunction is suspected and performing CT angiogram when vascular complications are suspected. Accurate tailoring of CT protocols increases the yield of imaging and is useful in appropriate retrieval of specimens/samples from abnormal airways and pulmonary parenchyma in identifying the specific pathology.
