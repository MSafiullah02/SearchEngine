It is estimated that tens of millions of people with psychiatric disorders in China are at risk of infection with the COVID-19 virus. More than one hundred patients with psychiatric disorders in Wuhan city have been infected with the virus. Psychiatric medical staff are faced with the task of treating psychiatric patients infected with COVID-19. The virus is highly infectious and has a fatality rate of about 4% in China (Chen et al., 2020b). Because of the high risk of infection, psychiatric medical staff must work under great pressure when dealing with these patients. The knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in Chinese psychiatric hospitals regarding COVID-19 are important in achieving victory in the battle against the epidemic.",

Hidiroglu et al. (2010) reported that it is important to empower healthcare workers by supporting their ability to acquire and use evidence-based information. Other studies have suggested that the implementation of appropriate education and protective measures improved staff members\u2019 willingness to work (Stergachis et al., 2011; Qureshi et al., 2005). Our study also revealed that advanced training was an independent variable associated with a greater likelihood to be willing to care for psychiatric patients suffering from the COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend that psychiatric hospitals in China should strengthen the training of staff on COVID-19-related information and practice. Some psychiatrists learned about COVID-19 from medical journals. Many research studies of COVID-19 have been published since the outbreak began (Bai et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan , 2020) and psychiatrists can better understand the etiology, pathology, and treatment of COVID-19 from these reports. In addition, we must better understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19.",

Psychiatrists provided support mainly through the psychological intervention hotline during this period (Liu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020a; Duan and Zhu, 2020) since psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses lacked the clinical experience and skills to combat the epidemic.",

This percentage differed from other studies on this subject in China. Ma et al., reported that more than 82% of respondents were willing to care for H1N1 patients. Compared with the H1N1 epidemic, COVID-19 has shown more infectivity and a higher fatality rate (Luo et al., 2020). In addition, the detailed characteristics of COVID-19 are currently unknown. These reasons may explain why more than 20% of the interviewed medical staff expressed a reluctance to treat psychiatric patients with COVID-19 infection. Notably, the most common reasons for unwillingness to care for the patients included a concern about infection of family members and themselves. With a deeper understanding of COVID-19, we believe that the number of medical staff who are willing to treat these patients would gradually increase.",

However, we enrolled the participants through Wechat, the most widely used social tool in China, which has a powerful friend\u2019s network. This makes it possible to administer questionnaires via WeChat using a convenience sampling method (Zhang et al., 2017). Second, this study was conducted in two psychiatric hospitals, possibly limiting the generalization of findings to other hospitals, for example, the psychiatry departments of general hospitals. Finally, the results of this study are based on a self-reported questionnaire. Previous studies have suggested that self-reported practice might not represent actual practice (Brunkhorst et al., 2008). Therefore, more research is needed to confirm the findings of this study.",
