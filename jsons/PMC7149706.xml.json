However, early civilizations also established that certain foods confer additional health benefits to humans as they can prevent and treat various diseases (Aluko, 2012). Therefore people have tried to achieve a better quality of life by eating more vegetables, fruits, and other plant foods; taking dietary supplements or nutraceuticals; or using nutritional therapy or phytotherapy to replace official medicines. Moreover, the availability of regional regulatory bodies has spurred intense global research and development with the aim of identifying new bioactive compounds that could be used to formulate functional foods and nutraceuticals (Pisanello, 2014). Hence the demands for nutraceuticals, phytonutrients, and their therapeutic services; manufacturers; marketers; and related licensed professionals have also increased accordingly (Bagchi et al., 2004).",

Nutraceuticals were described as \u201cfood or part of a food that provides health benefits and are used for prevention or treatment of a disease\u201d (Srivastava et al., 2015). They currently represent the fastest growing segment of the food industry with a market estimate of USD 6\u201360 billion (Prabu et al., 2012), growing at 5% per annum; however, this is unfortunately likely to attract irresponsible market entrants and products that do not deliver. Nutritionists must therefore ensure that the correct balance is struck between the exploitation of this lucrative business and adequate consumer protection. There is still much ignorance and confusion about nutrition in the minds of the general population. In the Western world \u223c70% of the population would buy specific foods to reduce the risk of diseases; however, they do not want to be faced with constant decisions about the health benefits of different foods or diets. Many are unwilling or unable to follow dietary guidelines, which is perhaps not surprising as dietary reference values take little or no account of today\u2019s busy lifestyles (Hardy, 2000).",

            "text": "The concepts of nutraceuticals, dietary supplements, functional foods, medical foods, and dietary supplements are confusing and the terms are often used interchangeably. Nutraceuticals are described as products extracted, purified, or produced from a plant, animal, or marine source (e.g., antioxidants from blueberries, elk velvet, or fish oils), or produced from dried, powdered, or pressed plant material. They have a demonstrable physiological benefit or provide protection against chronic diseases (Prabu et al., 2012; Srivastava et al., 2015). Dietary supplements have more defined health roles, as vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, and other dietary substances are intended to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake of these ingredients (Roberfroid, 2002). Dietary supplements are not intended to treat or cure disease (Gibson and Makrides, 2000) whereas nutraceuticals are used in the prevention or treatment of diseases. The concept of functional foods is different from that of nutraceuticals and they can be defined as food products that are used in the standard diet to provide beneficial health effects in addition to the traditional nutritional effects (Whitman, 2001). It is possible to link the key concepts (i.e., health, technology, and nutrition) with the main players in the functional food research and development process (i.e., food technologists, nutritionists, and specialists) (Fig. 9.1\n). The combination of skills possessed by these different players is essential for the development of innovative nutraceutical products. These products must present higher quality standards (and organoleptic properties) compared to corresponding conventional products and aim to maintain well-being (Bigliardi and Galati, 2013).",

In plant biochemistry these molecules are secondary metabolites (i.e., chemical compounds produced within the plants that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development, or reproduction of the organism). Some are found to defend against diseases, predators, ultraviolet radiation, parasites, and oxidants; some facilitate the reproductive process (e.g., serving as attractive smells and coloring agents); and others are important for interspecies competition (Kaur and Das, 2011). These same metabolites provide beneficial health and wellness effects in humans and animals. Evidence from epidemiological, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies has consistently demonstrated that a diet rich in plant foods can reduce the risk of some degenerative diseases including diabetes, obesity, inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular complications, and cancer (Cheung and Mehta, 2015).",

            "text": "Inflammation is a protective measure produced by an organism to eliminate an injurious stimuli. The use of antiinflammatory substances can be an effective tool in the therapeutic treatment of diseases; in this context, medicinal plants and their isolated compounds are used globally in folk medicine to treat different inflammatory conditions (De Cassia Da Silveira et al., 2013). In the continuous search for new natural bioactive antiinflammatory molecules, fruits are increasingly being seen as a rich source due to their essential oils and their isolated components, the monoterpenes (Dell\u2019Agli et al., 2013). Moreover, polyphenols are the most abundant bioactive compounds reaching values of 1 g/day in the diet, approximately 10-times higher than vitamin C intake (Arts and Hollman, 2005, Scalbert et al., 2005). The quantity and quality of polyphenols in plant foods may vary significantly according to intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as plant genetics, soil composition, growth conditions, stage of maturity, and postharvest conditions (Jeffery et al., 2003). The dietary intake of phenolics is greatly affected by the eating habits and preferences of individuals (Shahidi and Ambigaipalan, 2015). Simple phenolics (i.e., hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates and flavonoids) are important constituents of fruits, vegetables, and beverages. These compounds show a wide range of antioxidant activities in vitro and are thought to exert protective effects against major diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease (Rice-Evans et al., 1997). In the plant kingdom, antioxidant compounds can range from simple molecules (e.g., vitamin C and phenolic acids) to highly polymerized compounds (e.g., tannins). Phenolic compounds can be divided into many different classes (Fig. 9.2\n); however,\nflavonoids and phenolic acids are the most abundant in plant materials (Tabart et al., 2011, Tabart et al., 2012). These low molecular weight secondary metabolites exhibit excellent antioxidant properties. Moreover, organic acids are also considered as antioxidants with multiple uses in pharmacology (Eyduran et al., 2015); however, their specific mechanisms of action can vary depending on both the structure and the chemical environment (Komes et al., 2011).",

It belongs to the Annonaceae family, which includes 120 genera and over 2100 species. A. triloba is the only temperate species as the rest of the family thrives in tropical or subtropical climates. During the growing season, the pawpaw has a whitish to light-green color that turns yellow\u2013brown at maturity (Donno et al., 2014). The ripe fruit is highly aromatic and the banana-like flesh surrounds two rows of large bean-shaped brown seeds. Pawpaw fruits were traditionally consumed by Native Americans, then by European explorers and settlers, and today they are consumed by local populations in rural areas. Despite some consumer and professional interest, the high perishability of the fruit has been a major factor in slowing the development of this fruit in a larger market (McLaughlin, 2008).\n",

Native American communities also prepare a tea from the twigs to administer to women after birth, while a tonic from the bark is given to women after delivery to hasten discharge of the placenta. Moreover, several cultivars of Amelanchier spp. were found to possess free radical scavenging activity (due to their relatively high anthocyanin content) and antiviral activity against enteric coronavirus.

            "text": "Qualitative and quantitative studies of bioactive compounds mostly rely on selecting the proper extraction method (Smith, 2003). Extraction is the first step in the study of bioactive compounds and is crucial to the final result. The five main objectives of extraction are: (1) to extract targeted bioactive compounds from complex samples, (2) to increase the selectivity of analytical methods, (3) to increase the sensitivity of bioassays by increasing the concentration of targeted compounds, (4) to convert the bioactive compounds into a more suitable form for detection and separation, and (5) to provide a strong and reproducible method that is independent of variations in the sample matrix (Nedovi\u0107 et al., 2015). Therefore extraction should be carefully optimized and performed. The polarities of the different bioactive compounds, which vary significantly due to their conjugation status and their association with the sample matrix, determines the solvents to be used in the extraction (Sasidharan et al., 2011). When selecting solvents for the extraction of bioactive compounds, the molecular affinity between the solvent and solute, mass transfer, use of a cosolvent, environmental safety, human toxicity, and financial feasibility should also be considered (Nedovi\u0107 et al., 2015). Optimizing the extraction parameters not only increases the extraction efficiency of the analyte of interest but also reduces the solvent consumed and the waste generated during the extraction process, thus making it more environmental friendly (Chemat et al., 2012). Specific pretreatments (e.g., storage under modified atmosphere, microbial and chemical acidification, pasteurization, and utilization of depolymerizing enzymes) are sometimes needed to preserve the raw materials and extract biomolecules; moreover, additional procedures (e.g., rotary shaking, stirring, and sonication) can also be used to improve the extraction (Laufenberg et al., 2003).",

Spectroscopic methods usually permit crude identification of the bioactive compounds present in food, but in most cases the specific composition can remain obscure. However, spectrophotometry remains very useful for the evaluation of antioxidant activity (Table 9.1\n). Detailed information about the composition of food requires additional methods, such as chromatography and mass spectrometry, to fully characterize the structures of the molecules in the samples (Nedovi\u0107 et al., 2015). Technological innovation in analytical instruments has allowed increasingly sophisticated qualitative and quantitative assessments of the chemical composition of nutraceutical foods (Cordell, 2011). Chromatographic techniques are mainly used to analyze fresh foods and derived products. Chromatography offers a very powerful separation ability, such that the complex chemical components in the extracts can be separated into many relatively simple subfractions. Furthermore, the recent approaches of applying hyphenated chromatography and spectrometry such as high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013diode array detection (HPLC\u2013DAD), gas chromatography\u2013mass spectroscopy (GC\u2013MS), capillary electrophoresis\u2013DAD, HPLC\u2013MS, and HPLC\u2013nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), can provide additional spectral information. This is very helpful for qualitative analysis and for online structural elucidation (Liang et al., 2004, Steinmann and Ganzera, 2011). More specifically, HPLC is currently the most widely used analytical method when combined with different detectors (e.g., diode arrays, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence) (Donno et al., 2012). It is regarded as the gold standard in the authentication of nutraceuticals, functional foods, pharmaceuticals, and herbal medicines due to its precision, sensitivity, and reproducibility despite its high instrumental cost, relatively long analytical time, and large organic solvent consumption (Donno et al., 2015b).",

The active compounds are responsible for the intended pharmacological activity or synergistic therapeutic effects (Ong, 2004). It is necessary to determine most of the phytochemical constituents of analyzed products to ensure the reliability and repeatability of pharmacological and clinical research, as well as to understand the bioactivities and possible side effects of active compounds and to enhance quality control (Liang et al., 2004). Chromatography combined with a suitable detection technique offers a powerful tool for separating the individual compounds and developing a characteristic profile of the sample, otherwise known as a fingerprint. Combining a chromatographic separation system online with a spectroscopic detector has become the most important approach for identifying or confirming the identity of target and unknown chemical compounds (Cuadros-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2016).",

To analyze the large amount of generated data, a variety of analytical methods have proven to be useful and versatile tools for the extraction, visualization, and interpretation of the information. In particular, pattern recognition methods as a principal component analysis allows better visualization of the information included in the fingerprints. The original variables are transformed into latent variables to summarize the systemic patterns of variation between the samples (Ieri et al., 2013).

The origin of LCA can be found in the late 1960s within the context of American industry (Hunt et al., 1996) and numerous studies have been carried out to adapt this method to the agricultural sector (Audsley et al., 2003). LCA is now considered a useful tool for comparing alternative food products, processes, or services, and as the background for environmental product declaration (Schau and Fet, 2008). The results of LCAs are commonly presented as impacts in a range of different categories such as global warming, acidification, nitrification, ozone depletion, and toxicity (Pennington et al., 2004). Nevertheless, more importance and consideration is being given to the results in single impact categories. One example is the carbon footprint, which in the LCA approach corresponds to the \u201cglobal warming potential.\u201d This category expresses the number of CO2 equivalents (CO2eq., a collective unit for all molecules with a global warming potential) that are associated, directly and indirectly, with all stages of development of the system under consideration. The term CO2eq. is intended to express all greenhouse gases, with each being weighted according to their global warming potential. The advent of the carbon footprint has made LCA results available to a wider audience (Weidema et al., 2008).",

Even different varieties of the same species may have unique requirements in terms of fertilizers, pesticides, water, plantation strategies, and field management, which may result in different environmental burdens (De Gennaro et al., 2012). One exemplary case is the growing of ancient cultivars or forgotten fruits with high nutraceutical values (Donno et al., 2010, Donno et al., 2012). Ancient cultivars are bound to the area they are grown through centuries of slow adaptation to the pedoclimatic conditions, thus resulting in lower agricultural inputs compared to introduced cultivars (Bisht et al., 2007, Jarvis et al., 2008). A lower agricultural input theoretically produces a lower environmental impact; however, in order to be sure about this it is necessary to apply an environmental impact assessment method. A didactical case study was reported by Cerutti et al. (2013), in which the authors investigated the environmental burden of ancient varieties of apple in North West Italy. Hundreds of different cultivars of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) were grown in Italy until the 1950s. After this time the proliferation of commercial cultivars caused the local germplasm to lose importance and be forgotten by growers and consumers. Many ancient cultivars were gradually replaced by commercial ones with low phytochemical and nutraceutical traits. The Italian fruit-growing scene underwent significant change and Golden Delicious is now the most cultivated variety (more than 70% of total orchards); however, the genetic diversity has fortunately been largely preserved thanks to germplasm repositories (Donno et al., 2012).\n",

The study was performed in accordance with the ISO 14040:2006 standard series guidelines and with the cradle-to-gate approach as the basis for the life cycle inventory (LCI) (International Organization for Standardization, 1997). Data regarding orchard structure, agricultural inputs, resource consumption, and orchard management practices were obtained directly from the growers who filled in a questionnaire for the 2011 season. In order to consider minor geographical differences, the LCI for each cultivar included the average of three orchards spread throughout the two provinces. Environmental impacts were calculated according to several functional units. Considering the impacts for growing 1 hectare of orchard, the Golden Delicious cultivar showed the lowest environmental performance emitting 6.5 t CO2eq.; conversely, less emissions were observed in the life cycle of the three ancient cultivars (average 4.9 t CO2eq.). This result confirms that if low-input agricultural systems are managed properly, and are producing high-value products (including high levels of nutraceutical components), they can be more sustainable than high-input systems (Cerutti et al., 2013).",

This will permit their increased use in foods (instead of artificial drugs), which will in turn increase their quality and added value. New methodologies for the extraction, purification, identification, and quantification of biomolecules using ecofriendly analytical techniques will need to be developed to improve the extraction yields (Chemat et al., 2012, Oroian and Escriche, 2015). With the advent of high-throughput technologies and their applications in food science, the food and beverage industries have been taking steps to transform their traditional R&D and product development processes. The food and beverage industries are now faced with a situation in which they should quickly adapt to new market demands and regulatory updates and be prepared to make expensive and risky decisions as to whether they should proceed with significant investments in the development of functional products (Younesi and Ayseli, 2015).",

Once this source has been identified, a constant and stable supply of plant material should be secured. This means that an agronomic system for biomass production should be developed in order to allow the full expression of the genetic capability of the cultivar (Kerslake and Menary, 1985, Khan, 2006). Moreover, climate and soil conditions should fit with the species requirements. The impact of fertilization and irrigation on the biomass production and its chemical constituents should be understood and the economic growth and cultivation of the raw material should generally be explored (Lakusic et al., 2011). In the future, a plant production of secondary metabolites may be controlled with different growth regulators according to good agricultural practices used in this agronomic production (Donno et al., 2013a). The successful production of biomass should include the development of appropriate harvest techniques and storage processes and mechanization of the harvest process should be addressed in order to maintain an economic system of production (Spinelli et al., 2012). The integral exploitation of the entire food production supply chain could have economic benefits to producers and a beneficial impact on the environment, leading to a greater diversity of products for human consumption. These products represent a new class of functional foods that have not been completely exploited and that could also contribute health benefits to consumers. Due to the safety and limitations surrounding the use of synthetic antioxidants, natural antioxidants and nutraceuticals obtained from edible sources (i.e., underutilized fruit species and derived products) are alternative sources of interest (Shahidi and Zhong, 2015).",
