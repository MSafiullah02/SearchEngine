In social network topology, we observed the network is consisted of many nodes with small connectivity and a few high-degree nodes. In the small connectivity part, there are many nodes which have only one degree. Most of past social network models can not generate this part. In this paper, we proposed a social network model based on topology vision and with tunable high hub connectivity. At the same time, we suggested a new characteristic of social network, condensed clustering coefficient, to replace the original clustering coefficient. Finally, this study also includes the analysis of real social network data.",

The relationships include friends, co-authorships, human sexual relations, and other interactions between people. In this study, an individual person is as a node and the relationship between two persons as an edge. If there is any relationship between two persons, one edge is added between the two nodes. Therefore, a social network is constructed. Recent research about social network analysis [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] focused on observing clustering coefficient property, and power law degree distribution phenomena.

In condensed clustering coefficient C', the suitable f is 0.20, and x is from 0.05 to 0.20. In shortest path L and s-metric S, all parameters are suitable. The tail index \u03b3 of the OAC is 1.439, but our model only generates 1.52 to 1.68 under the parameters. The one degree in the network O of the OAC is 0.339, but our model only generates 0.19 Fig. 3 . The clustering coefficient C with node N=2000, degree k=4 to 9, parameter f=0.5, and parameter x=0 to 1 to 0.24 under the parameters. The reason is that we use only two parameters to tune our social network, and that is a little difficult to control six characteristics. In this simulation, we choice f=0. 15 and x=0.20 to plot the degree distribution as Fig. 2 , and it demonstrates scale-free property. Furthermore, we used other parameters to simulate the social network. The parameters in Fig. 3 , 4, 5, 6 and 7 are node N=2000, degree k=4 to 9, and parameter f=0.5. Fig. 3 shows the clustering coefficient relation with parameter x=0 to 1, and when x is large, C is large. The reason is that, when x is large, there will generate more high-degree nodes. The more high-degree nodes cause higher clustering coefficient since the neighbor nodes of high-degree nodes maybe become their neighbors' neighbor nodes. Fig. 4 demonstrates the tail index relationship with the same parameters of Fig.3 . The more x makes, the less \u03b3 is. The reason is that, the large x is, the larger hubnodes become. The more large hub-nodes make, the less tail index \u03b3 is. Fig. 5 shows the s-metric relationship with the same parameters of Fig. 3 , and this is absolutely for large x made large S. Fig. 6 displays the one degree in the network relationship with the same parameters of Fig.3 . The more x makes, the more O is. Since the more x makes more hub-nodes, and cause the other nodes have less degree, and the more O is. Fig. 7 demonstrates the condensed clustering coefficient relationship with the same parameters of Fig. 3 . This figure is like Fig. 3 , and then divides by (1-O) . That presents the clustering coefficient eliminates the nodes which only have one degree. Fig. 7 .
