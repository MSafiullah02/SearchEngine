            "text": "The unprecedented circumstances of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have proven to be particularly challenging due to a lack of established therapies and treatment guidelines. Although highly contagious, infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seems to be less virulent than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in terms of morbidity and mortality [1]. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in infected individuals ranges from asymptomatic or mild disease to critical illness with rapid deterioration, and death [1]. As such, the treatment of patients varies based on disease severity and consideration of underlying medical conditions (Table 1\n). Several drugs have emerged as candidates for treatment, including nucleotide analogs (remdesivir) and anti-malarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) [2]. Protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir) and interferon-\u03b2 have also been included in ongoing clinical trials, but are not recommended for treatment at this time [2]. There have also been increased concerns regarding the potential for increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in patients taking medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists, that upregulate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [3]. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19, as a resource for health care professionals as we await the results of ongoing clinical trials around the world.",

It is an experimental drug that has demonstrated antiviral activity against several RNA viruses including Ebola, SARS, and MERS in vitro and in non-human primates [1,4]. In a case report, a US patient with COVID-19 was recently treated with remdesivir on a compassionate use basis due to worsening clinical status and his condition improved remarkably [5]. Within 2 days of initiating treatment, he no longer required supplemental oxygen and his only symptoms were a dry cough and mild rhinorrhea [5]. There was an additional case reported in which remdesivir was used and the patient recovered [6]. Although the data are limited to case reports, remdesivir may be a potential candidate for therapy. Non-human primates with MERS-CoV treated with a combination of remdesivir and interferon- \u03b2 were found to have improved pulmonary function and reduced lung viral loads, when compared to those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon- \u03b2 [7]. The most common adverse effects reported were gastrointestinal in nature, as well as elevation in transaminases and infusion site reactions (Table 2\n).",

Ritonavir is also a protease inhibitor, but its primary role is to boost lopinavir concentrations and prolong its half-life via cytochrome P450 inhibition. A study conducted in 2004 found that patients with SARS-associated coronavirus treated with a combination of these protease inhibitors and ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, were found to have decreased viral loads, rising peripheral lymphocyte counts, and significantly lower adverse events (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death) [15]. Patients treated with this combination therapy were also found to have a decreased need for corticosteroids and reduced risk of nosocomial infection, when compared to patients given standard care (ribavirin only) [15]. This study prompted a clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of using lopinavir/ritonavir to treat COVID-19, which concluded that there was no observed benefit of using this combination therapy in the treatment of severe COVID-19 infection [16]. Subsequent studies, however, suggest that early administration of lopinavir/ritonavir is effective in reducing viral load and improving clinical outcomes in patients with mild to moderate disease [17,18]. The effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19 is controversial at this time. Overall, lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse effects compared to standard care and in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, 13.8% required discontinuation of therapy [15]. The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir is also known to cause QT prolongation and there is concern regarding the multiple drug-drug interactions associated with ritonavir in particular (Table 2) [9].",

A study conducted in 2005 found that chloroquine's ability to elevate endosomal pH and therefore inhibit pH-dependent steps in the viral replication process, was effective in mitigating the spread of infection to other host cells [21]. Chloroquine has also been found to have some immunomodulatory effects through the suppression of Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 and IL-6 release, which may help prevent the cytokine storm that leads to rapid deterioration of patients with COVID-19 [1,22]. Furthermore, chloroquine was found to show some efficacy in treating COVID-19 associated pneumonia in a multicenter clinical trial with >100 patients in China [23]. Subsequent studies have found that hydroxychloroquine has increased potency and a more tolerable safety profile when compared to chloroquine [24]. In a recent nonrandomized clinical trial, 14 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine alone and 6 patients were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [25]. A substantial reduction in viral load and more rapid virus elimination was seen in patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; however, the majority of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone continued to display symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract infections [25]. While the data supporting the use of these drugs are limited at best, media coverage surrounding this treatment has prompted self-medication with compounds that contain chloroquine in an effort to prevent COVID-19 infection. It should be noted that when used inappropriately, chloroquine and to a lesser extent hydroxychloroquine, are very toxic and can cause fatal dysrhythmias and electrolyte shifts (Table 2) [26].",

A study conducted in China found that the use of methylprednisolone decreased risk of death in patients with COVID-19 who develop ARDS [31].

The mechanism by which NSAIDs increase ACE2 expression is not well understood; however, fever has been reported as one of the most common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, are often used for their anti-pyretic and anti-inflammatory effects in the setting of infection [38]. Although there is a lack of evidence supporting the potential risks of NSAID use in patients with COVID-19, it may be prudent to use alternative anti-pyretic medications such as acetaminophen, until more concrete data are available [39]. Interestingly, a study conducted in 2006 found that the NSAID indomethacin was a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-1 replication in dogs, suggesting that it could be a beneficial therapy for SARS infection [40]. However, no evidence exists as to the effects of indomethacin in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The WHO initially recommended against the use of ibuprofen, but has since revised its statement and states that either acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be used [39]. Additional studies are required to determine what risk, if any, NSAIDs pose in the setting of COVID-19 infection.",

In fact, abruptly discontinuing treatment with these anti-hypertensives or switching to other hypertension medications may increase the risk of adverse clinical outcomes associated with uncontrolled hypertension. Leading cardiology organizations advise against the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs and recommend that physicians assess the clinical condition of individual patients before making any changes to their treatment regimens [41]. Recently, it was found that a recombinant protein made by attaching the extracellular domain of ACE2 to the Fc region of IgG, was effective in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [42]. Although more research is needed on the efficacy of this fusion protein in humans, this could represent a viable option for the treatment of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Although there are currently no available therapies that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2, several medications have emerged as potential treatments. Due to the low cost, easy accessibility, and lack of alternative treatment options, treatment with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is often considered for hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. It should be noted that the use of antimalarials for COVID-19 is based on a single study with a small sample size, non-randomized control group, and significant drop out in the treatment group [25]. As such, the efficacy of this treatment is still questionable, and the risk of significant adverse effects should be considered prior to initiating treatment with these drugs. Among antivirals, remdesivir could be a promising candidate and may be more widely available in the upcoming weeks. Passive immunization has been successfully used in the past; however, the efficacy of convalescent plasma in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is still largely unknown. Many institutions are beginning to use this treatment as more individuals recover from the disease and convalescent plasma becomes available. Although there were many concerns regarding the use of medications such as ibuprofen and RAAS antagonists in patients with COVID-19, current guidelines state that ibuprofen may be used and recommend against the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. We must continue to reevaluate current treatment recommendations as new data emerges and discourage inappropriate prescribing and hoarding of medications. At the same time, parallel efforts are also focusing on vaccine development, infection control measures, as well as optimal respiratory and supportive care. (Table 1).",
