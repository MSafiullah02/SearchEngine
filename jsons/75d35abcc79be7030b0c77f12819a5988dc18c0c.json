To tie our model to empirical estimates of R 0 for COVID-19, we wish to compute a scaling factor \u03b2 for the matrix C which gives rise to an exponential growth in n j=1 I j (t) which corresponds to the empirical R 0 value computed early in an epidemic (before a substantial fraction of the population is infected), given an infection distributed according to the early-stable proportion vector \u03b3. For the vector \u03b3, multiplication by CM \u03c1 is equivalent to multiplication by the eigenvalue \u03bb 1 , thus for an infected population with age distribution proportional to \u03b3, and writing I for n j=1 I j , the dynamics near t = 0 reduce (1) to a standard single population SIR model with the infected population governed by the equation",

(In particular, if all groups were equally likely to interact, [6] would report a contact matrix in which each row was equal to the populationproportion vector for the age groups). The dynamics we describe in (1), etc., already account for the proportion of the susceptible population which belongs to each age group, thus we process the contact matrix by dividing column by the proportion of the population in the corresponding age group. This results in a nearly symmetric matrix, which we symmetrize by taking the average of pairs of elements reflected across the diagonal. We also bin the 5-year age groups used in [6] to correspond to our 10-year age groups, and treat the 80+ and 70-79 groups identically for the purposes of the contact matrix, since [6] does not provide separate contact data for the 80+ age group.",

At the same time, we see that the best strategies for age-targeting are sensitive to the fraction of the younger population which can be released. In general, if too few people are released initially, a second wave occurs when transmission levels return to normal. Conversely, if too many are released, ICU utilization is high in the first wave. Thus the optimum choice for the age cutoff depends on the fraction of people we expect below the age cutoff to actually be released.",
