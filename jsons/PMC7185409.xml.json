            "text": "Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a general illness in children which usually is caused by some human enteroviruses (Cherry, 1992). There were many reports which indicated some pandemics of HFMD were associated with EV71 infection in the Asia-Pacific area (AbuBakar et al., 1999, Chumakov et al., 1979, Fujimoto et al., 2002, Ho et al., 1999, Lin et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2000, Zheng et al., 1995). EV71 belongs to members of the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family and is a positive-strand RNA virus with a genome size of about 7500 bp. The two non-translated regions (5\u2032-NTR and 3\u2032-NTR) flank the single open reading frame (ORF) of EV71 virus genome. The coding sequence encodes one polyprotein that is cleaved by viral proteases to generate 11 proteins, namely VP4, VP2, VP3, VP1, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D. The structural proteins VP1-3 are exposed on EV71 surface. The VP1 gene contained the major antigenic sites and genetic diversity associated with serotypes (Oberste et al., 1999a, Oberste et al., 1999b). Non-structural proteins were involved in polyprotein processing, RNA replication and the shut-down of host cell protein synthesis. In addition, recombinations are well known to result in a genetic diversity and evolution of enteroviruses (Chan and AbuBakar, 2004, Chen et al., 2010, Yoke-Fun and AbuBakar, 2006). Due to various genetic diversities of EV71, the effect of the vaccine is limited to prevent children from EV71. This situation has made researchers aware of the importance of analysis of EV71 genetic diversity (Bible et al., 2008, Cardosa et al., 2003, Herrero et al., 2003, Huang et al., 2008, Lewis-Rogers et al., 2009, McMinn, 2002, Sanders et al., 2006). It is noticed that nucleotide composition comprising of EV71 coding sequence with various genetic diversities is selective rather than random, because the natural selection from host is responsible to select various strains shaped by mutation. In previous reports, translation selection and compositional constraints under the mutational pressure are thought to be the major factors accounting for codon usage variation among genomes in microorganisms (Gu et al., 2004, Karlin and Mr\u00e1zek, 1996, Lesnik et al., 2000, Liu et al., 2010, Zhou et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2010). In some RNA viruses, compared with natural selection, mutation pressure plays a more important role in synonymous codon usage pattern (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003, Levin and Whittome, 2000). Although it is known that compositional constraints and translation selection are the more generally accepted mechanisms accounting for codon usage bias (Coleman et al., 2008, Karlin et al., 1990, Zhi et al., 2010, Zhou et al., 1999), other selection forces have also been proposed such as fine-tuning translation kinetics selection as well as escape of cellular antiviral responses (Aragones et al., 2008, Aragones et al., 2010, Karlin et al., 1994, Sugiyama et al., 2005). Thus, the codon usage pattern may be important to disclose the molecular mechanism and evolutionary process of EV71 avoiding host cell response. To our knowledge, it is the first study that the synonymous codon usage pattern and evolutional dynamics of EV71 were systemically analyzed and the relationship between codon usage pattern of EV71 and that of its host was also analyzed.",

Among these virus examined, the ENC value for EV71 is highest, suggesting that EV71 has a most weak codon usage bias. In addition, we set up a plot which showed the relationship between GC3% and ENC values of all viral proteins (excluding the very small 3B protein) of EV71 virus, and found that the plots of coding sequences for VP1, VP2, VP3, 2A, 2C, 3A, 3C and 3D aggregated around the expected curve, but the plots of coding sequences for VP4 and 2B scattered highly under the expected curve (Fig. S4a\u20134c). It may be explained that the codon usage bias of VP4 and 2B genes is influenced by their small size. In addition, there is no obvious geographic factor in influencing codon usage bias of the coding sequences of EV71, implying that the natural selection from the geographic factor does not affect the codon usage patterns of specific coding sequences of EV71, but shape the pattern of the whole sequence of this virus. Furthermore, we found that some specific non-optimal codons are preferentially chosen in some coding sequences of EV71. In details, three non-optimal codons (UUA, CUA and GUU) are chosen in the VP4 gene, UUG in the VP3 gene, CUU in the VP1 and 3A genes, UUU, CUU and GUU in the 3C gene. It is also found that all coding sequences of EV71 contain some preferential codons.

            "text": "The pattern of codon usage is a genetic characteristic of various organisms. Previous reports have been focused on viruses in Picornavirdae family, such as FMDV, HAV, Poliovirus (Aragones et al., 2008, Aragones et al., 2010, Coleman et al., 2008, Zhong et al., 2007). Because A%, U%, G3% and C3% play roles in the formation of the different optimal codons with any nucleotide-ended, the codon usage pattern of EV71 is likely influenced by composition constraints. The codon usage pattern of PV is mostly coincident with that of its host, while the codon usage pattern of HAV is antagonistic to that of its host (Mueller et al., 2006, S\u00e1nchez et al., 2003). The codon usage pattern of EV71 is a mixture of the two types of codon usage. The coincident portion of codon usage pattern of EV71 enable the corresponding amino acids to be translated efficiently, the other antagonistic portion of codon usage pattern of EV71 may enable viral proteins to be folded properly, although the translation efficiency of the corresponding amino acids decreased. In Epstein-Barr virus latent genes deoptimize codon usage in order to evade competition for host protein translation (Karlin et al., 1990) and attenuation of PV activity was performed by rare codon pairs inducing poor translation for sequences of viral proteins (Coleman et al., 2008). These results suggest that disfavored codons coding for amino acids may not be deleterious factor for viruses to adapt to host cells. For codon usage patterns of the coding sequences of EV71, the VP2, 2A, 2B, 2C and 3D genes possess only some preferential codons and none of non-optimal codons is preferentially used, implying that translation of the whole coding sequence of EV71 is possibly regulated under the translation selection. Furthermore, the alternative translation is the possibility of fine-tuning the kinetics of protein translation by a combination of rare and optimal codons (Aragones et al., 2010, Komar, 2009). For codon usage patterns of VP4, VP3, VP1, 3A and 3C genes of EV71, these genes possess combination of some non-optimal codons and optimal ones which are preferentially used, implying that translation of the coding sequences of EV71 is possibly regulated under fine-tuning translation kinetics selection.",

By analyzing the codon usage pattern of the whole coding sequence of strains from different areas, genetic diversity resulting from geographic and social factors is likely observed. The genetic diversity of the most strains from China-Mainland could indicate that a relatively independent area with geographic, public health and personal communication that enables the genetic diversity of EV71 to be sustained with little outside influence. Compared with the genetic diversity of strains from China-Mainland, that of strains from China-Taiwan and Malaysia also indicated that social factors play an important role in shaping the codon usage patterns of these strains. Based on the genetic diversities of China-Taiwan and Malaysia, social factors may play important roles in shaping codon usage patterns of EV71 from the two areas. These genetic diversities of EV71 strains from different areas give a sign that geographic and social factors should be noticed at genetic diversity of virus from different areas.",

As for RNA viruses, previous study reported that the major factor in shaping codon usage patterns appears to be mutation pressure rather than natural selection (Liu et al., 2010, Zhao et al., 2008, Zhong et al., 2007, Zhou et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2010). However, the genetic characteristics of EV71 suggest the interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection, although ENC values for the whole coding sequence of EV71 suggest mutation pressure is a factor in influencing codon usage pattern. Furthermore, in Fig. S4a\u20134c, the relationship between ENC data for EV71 proteins and CG3% indicated that natural selection probably play roles in genetic diversity of EV71 strains except for mutation pressure in order to adapt to host. A general mutational pressure, which affects the whole genome would certainly account for the majority of the codon usage among some RNA viruses (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003).",
