            "text": "A nation's culture refers to the shared psychological meanings and collective practices that distinguish one nation from another (Hofstede, 1980). The shared cultural meanings have been operationalized in various ways, such as cultural values (Hofstede, 1980; Schwartz & Bilsky, 1987; Triandis, 1995), self-construals (Markus & Kitayama, 1991), thinking styles (Ji, Nisbett, & Su, 2001; Nisbett, Peng, Choi, & Norenzayan, 2001; Spencer-Rodgers, Williams, & Peng, 2010), regulatory focus (Higgins, Pierro, & Kruglanski, 2008; Kurman & Hui, 2011), and so on. Given that members from the same nation are socialized to use their culture-specific orientations to guide their daily coping processes, there are significant cross-cultural differences in individuals' appraisals of stressors, choices of coping strategies, and indicators of adaptive outcomes (Heppner, 2008; Wong & Wong, 2006). In this section, we discuss how culture plays a pervasive role in shaping the ways people assess and cope with career-related stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic emerges as a stressful and even traumatic event that requires individuals to make sense of the new situation and choose appropriate coping actions. Since cultural values reflect the desirable end states that are worth pursuing (Hofstede, 1980; Schwartz & Bilsky, 1987; Triandis, 1995), they are likely to influence members' attentiveness to and prioritization of stressors in the appraisal processes. For example, in a country that values individualism (vs. collectivism), people tend to form an independent (vs. interdependent) self-construal (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) and prefer to use ideal self (vs. ought self) to guide their behaviors (Higgins et al., 2008; Kurman & Hui, 2011). These cultural orientations will direct members' attention to stressors closely related to their personal career development (Heppner, 2008), such as job insecurity, difficulties of working from home, emergence of new career opportunities, and so on. In contrast, in a collectivistic culture, people's attention may go beyond their personal career development considerations to include issues related to their work groups, organizations, and social networks (Guan et al., 2015; Guan, Deng, Risavy, Bond, & Li, 2011; Wong & Wong, 2006). Based on different appraisal processes, the choices of coping strategies and their effects may differ (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), which will be discussed below. As individualism, self-construals and regulatory focus only represent limited aspects of cultural influence, future research should adopt a more comprehensive framework of cultural orientations (e.g., Schwartz & Bilsky, 1987) to advance existing literature on cultural differences in appraisals of stressors.",

            "text": "To cope with the various stressors associated with COVID-19, individuals may choose to use primary control (e.g., directly solving the associated problems) or secondary control (e.g., accommodating and reappraising existing problems) strategies (Rothbaum et al., 1982). The choices of coping strategies have also been found to be shaped by national culture (e.g., De Vaus, Hornsey, Kuppens, & Bastian, 2018; Heppner, 2008; Weisz, Rothbaum, & Blackburn, 1984). For example, through comparing Japanese and American cultural traditions and practices, Weisz et al. (1984) found that primary control strategies are heavily emphasized in American society whereas secondary control strategies are more valued in Japanese society. Evidence points to cultural differences in thinking styles (Ji et al., 2001; Nisbett et al., 2001; Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2010) helps to account for such Eastern-Western differences in coping strategies. Specifically, Easterners (e.g., Chinese, Japanese) are more likely to use holistic (vs. analytical) and dialectical thinking styles than Westerners (e.g., Americans), which are characterized by the emphasis of context (vs. objects) as the determining forces, the expectation of constant changes (e.g., bad things can be transformed into good things), as well as the tolerance of contradiction (e.g., opposite characteristics or elements can coexist with each other). Although the primary control strategies are generally preferred by Westerners, the holistic and dialectical thinking styles give rise to the tendency of valuing the secondary control strategies and using both among Easterners (De Vaus et al., 2018; Heppner, 2008), which helps to explain the high levels of resilience, or even optimism, of Easterners when facing difficult situations (De Vaus et al., 2018; Ji, Zhang, Usborne, & Guan, 2004).",

Smith et al. (2002) found that managers from high power distance cultures are more likely to seek guidance from vertical sources (e.g., superiors, authorities) rather than lateral sources (e.g., peers). Similarly, the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE, House et al., 2004) study of 62 societies shows that people in low (vs. high) power distance cultures tend to endorse participative leadership (i.e., leaders include others in decision-making processes). These findings suggest that in high power distance cultures (e.g., China, Singapore, Saudi Arabia), a centralized decision-making process dominated by top leaders is more likely to be viewed as a legitimate way to formulate and implement collective coping strategies, whereas in low power distance cultures (e.g., USA, UK), participative decision-making process that involves stakeholders from diverse backgrounds is preferred. For example, in China, the central government requires all schools to be closed to prevent the spread of the virus; while in America, this is not unanimously decided by the Federal government but is individually assessed by each school, at least at the beginning (Sawchuk, 2020). These distinct ways of decision-making have a great impact on the progress of curbing COVID-19 at the national level, which will consequently impact members' individual coping processes.",

It has been found that cultural tightness is positively related to more political forces to suppress dissent and control social order (Gelfand et al., 2011). Accordingly, in tight cultures (e.g., Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea and China), governments tend to make strict behavioral guidance for the public (e.g., social distancing, wearing masks, tracking individual health conditions) and closely monitor and punish deviance (e.g., Brueck, 2020).",

Those workers contribute to minimizing the collective damage and securing the national interest, at the potential expense of their own physical and mental well-being (e.g. Heren, 2020).

The excessive work stress and risks during the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to decreased self-regulation strengths or even traumas (Fouad & Bynner, 2008; Guan, Arthur, Khapova, Hall, & Lord, 2019). On the other hand, this work experience may also arouse a strong sense of pride and highlight the meaningfulness and significance of their profession. It may also help them build feelings of emotional bonding and connections with peer doctors who fight side by side with them, creating opportunities for new career skill development and future career opportunities (Fouad & Bynner, 2008; Guan et al., 2019).

However, the permission of more individual liberty may influence the efficiency and effectiveness of collective coping policies against the COVID-19 due to the lower compliance (e.g., social distancing).

From a social identity perspective (Tajfel & Turner, 1986), an important individual moderator for the impact of national culture is a member's cultural identification, which refers to the extent to which a member considers national culture as an important component of his/her self-concepts. In all cultures, there are members who have a low level of identification and they may disagree with the shared norms and collective actions of a nation. For example, even in a collectivistic culture, there are individuals who prioritize personal interests over public benefits and defy collective coping actions, such as escaping from quarantine, hoarding essential hygiene products or concealing health information (e.g. Yiga, 2020).",

For example, people who identify with certain cultural groups may perceive other groups as a threat, leading to intolerance and aggressive behaviors against other groups (Russell, 2020), which may further escalate into a larger-scale social crisis. Governments and social institutions should seek guidance from cultural and intergroup theories to effectively prevent these incidents. Previous research has shown that it is possible to shift members' representations of group boundaries and guide them to include another group into a more inclusive, super-ordinate group (Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000; Guan et al., 2011). For example, by sending strong signals of \u201cshared similarity\u201d or \u201ccommon fate\u201d (Drury, 2018), governments and social institutions can promote cultural members' perceived similarity and common goals with other groups, to transcend the barrier of group membership.",

This polyculture perspective suggests that nowadays individuals are capable of developing multiple cultural identities, and these identities can be primed and activated by relevant cues to help individuals adapt to the changing situational demands (Oyserman & Lee, 2008). This approach will not only help to understand cross-cultural differences in coping strategies and career management strategies under the COVID-19 pandemic, but will also provide important guidance for individuals to develop a more flexible and adaptive way to cope with the emerging challenges in their career development (e.g., Cheng, 2009). This dynamic view of culture also carries important implications for the cultural adaptation and career management strategies of sojourners, expatriates, immigrants, and so on (Guan et al., 2018).",

In addition to national culture, other characteristics of a nation, such as economical, geopolitical and historical factors, also play important roles in shaping members' behaviors, which should also be taken into consideration in future research (Tsui, Nifadkar, & Ou, 2007). As culture can be manifested at different levels, future research should adopt a multi-level approach to examine how national culture, regional culture, professional/occupational culture and organizational culture interplay with each other in influencing individuals' coping and career management strategies (Leung et al., 2005). Lastly, although national culture is often viewed as a relatively stable factor, it is also subjective to change (Hamamura, 2012; Huang et al., 2018). Whether the COVID-19 pandemic and the individual and collective actions aiming to cope with this crisis would lead to significant changes to culture is an important question that needs to be answered in future research.",
