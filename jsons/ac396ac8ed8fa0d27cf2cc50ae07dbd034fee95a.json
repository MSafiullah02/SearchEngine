The present aim was to propose an hypothesis that there is a potential association between mean levels of vitamin D in various countries with cases and mortality caused by COVID-19. The mean levels of vitamin D for 20 European countries and morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19 were acquired. Negative correlations between mean levels of vitamin D (average 56 mmol/L, STDEV 10.61) in each country and the number of COVID-19 cases/1 M (mean 295.95, STDEV 298.7, and mortality/1 M (mean 5.96, STDEV 15.13) were observed. Vitamin D levels are severely low in the aging population especially in Spain, Italy and Switzerland. This is also the most vulnerable group of the population in relation to COVID-19. It should be advisable to perform dedicated studies about vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients with different degrees of disease severity.",

ACE2 is the host cell receptor responsible for mediating infection by SARS-CoV-2. From this perspective it might be apparent that the risk of infection can be higher. However, vitamin D has multiple roles in the immune system that can modulate the body reaction to an infection. Abu-Amer et al. have described that vitamin D deficiency impairs the ability of macrophages to mature, to produce macrophage-specific surface antigens, to produce the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase, and to secrete H 2 O 2 , a function integral to their antimicrobial function [12] . This might explain, in part, why Martineau et al. have observed that vitamin D was protective in cases of hypovitaminosis [5] . Crucial in the innate immune response are the toll-like receptors which recognise molecules related to pathogens and when activated release cytokines and induce reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, cathelicins and defensins. Several of the toll-like receptors affect or are affected by vitamin D receptor induction [3] .",
