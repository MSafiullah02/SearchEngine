Reports of malaria peaked in 2000 one year after the new law enactment and steadily decreased to the same level before 1999. On the other hand, Dengue fever is increasing. It is not possible to determine whether the reporting rate of malaria has decreased recently or not, it will be necessary to evaluate the surveillance system including assessment of missed opportunity for diagnosis and treatment.
