Less than half the episodes in children of ILI (26 out of 59, 44%) had a respiratory sample sent. This reduced sampling is probably due to the added burden on parents of sample collection (and posting) while a child is ill. In addition, as the childcare centres were in the suburbs with relatively lower Socio\u2010Economic Indexes for Areas\n35\n (and also involved larger families), this, too, may have limited parental cooperation. The participants were only followed from the 2nd half of August when the 2007 season was peaking, so some may have thought that sample collection in September or October was too late. Given the limited data that were collected on symptomatology and the relatively small number of specimens, it was not possible to do an extensive analysis comparing symptoms by virus type to address if there are differences in symptoms among various viruses. Furthermore, the demographic data (e.g. sex, age range) of those who did not participate in the study were not collected; therefore, it was not possible to identify if there was any recruitment bias. Greater efforts are required for future studies in (i) improving the proportion of swabs collected and sent by initiating ILI follow up before the influenza season starts and findings better ways to overcome parents\u2019 reluctance in submitting swabs; (ii) obtaining more detailed data on symptomatology of respiratory infection; and (iii) collecting de\u2010identified demographic data on those who are not enrolled in the study.",
