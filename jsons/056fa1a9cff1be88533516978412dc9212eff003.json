While governments and businesses are eager to enjoy the benefits of AI innovations, the mixed impact of these autonomous and intelligent systems on human well-being has become a pressing issue. This article introduces one of the first international standards focused on the social and ethical implications of AI: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineerings (IEEE) Standard (Std) 7010-2020 Recommended Practice for Assessing the Impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems on Human Well-being. Incorporating well-being factors throughout the lifecycle of AI is both challenging and urgent and IEEE 7010 provides key guidance for those who design, deploy, and procure these technologies. We begin by articulating the benefits of an approach for AI centered around well-being and the measurement of well-being data. Next, we provide an overview of IEEE 7010, including its key principles and how the standard relates to approaches and perspectives in place in the AI community. Finally, we indicate where future efforts are needed.",

Issues such as algorithmic bias and lack of transparency in facial recognition, natural language processing, and criminal justice [17] , [18] have captured public interest, along with the role of AI in targeted advertising and political misinformation [19] , [20] . Privacy [21] , inequality [22] , social cohesion [23] , and labor displacement [24] are among the many social and ethical risks to human well-being associated with AI. In response, governments, corporations, and NGOs have proposed new ethical codes, principles, frameworks, industry standards, and policy strategies [25] - [27] . Assessments of AIs impact on human and societal well-being are relatively new, and there is not much known about how to incorporate a well-being orientation and measurement into organizational or public settings. Thus, we suggest that IEEE 7010 offers initial guidance and sets the stage for increasingly robust and rigorous development, deployment, and evaluation of AI in the future.",

The urgency of well-being in the autonomous/intelligent systems era Well-being is a complex, multidimensional, and occasionally contested subject studied for almost half a century by scholars in psychology, management, economics, and policy [10] , [30] , [31] . Some scholars of well-being distinguish between hedonic, eudaimonic, and social dimensions of wellbeing. Hedonic well-being emphasizes immediate subjective experiences, such as positive and negative affect and life satisfaction (National Research Council 2013), while the eudaimonic dimension of well-being takes into account a broader definition of flourishing [32] . Well-being also has both objective and subjective components, where the former refers to traditional economic metrics like health and income, and the latter to internal subjective experience [33] , [34] . The Organization for Economic Co-operation (OECD) (2011; 2013) conceives of well-being as incorporating numerous domains of social and economic life such as education, economy, environment, health, government, community, culture, work, psychological well-being, and human settlements and encompassing both subjective and objective components. Well-being incorporates an orientation towards human rights, one which enjoys wide support and is deeply grounded in legal systems [35] , as well environmental sustainability, now maturely incorporated into industry standards and processes [36] . Over time, the study of well-being has matured into an increasingly comprehensive, theoretically and empirically rigorous, and applied field, that is gaining traction among researchers as a perspective and in public policy [9] , [31] .",

Stout [43] as well as Tepper and Hern [44] emphasize recent trends in corporate governance, arguing that corporations which prioritize short-term financial gain too often fail to protect the public. These concerns have given rise to calls for increased corporate social responsibility and governmental action that protect human and societal wellbeing. Movements focused on corporate social responsibility that incorporate environmental sustainability and human wellbeing [45] - [47] are gaining purchase as a variety of new conceptual and organizational strategies have surfaced. These include the Beyond GDP [48] , triple bottom line [49] , and social enterprise models [50] , now enhanced via formal certification of socially responsible organizations as B Corps [51] and through legal incorporation as public benefit corporations [52] .",

Measurement allows organizations to evaluate successes and failures, which can be used in goal setting, prioritization, and management. \u2022 Developing infrastructure: incorporating well-being helps organizations build the necessary infrastructure for thinking about, analyzing, and responding to well-being data. Developing infrastructure includes processes for integrating well-being considerations into data collection, decision-making, identifying roles and responsibilities, and business use case development, all areas that require organizational infrastructure. \u2022 Managing risks: well-being measurement and reporting helps organizations and society both individually and collectively assess the risks of various AI products and services. Managing risks safeguards employee, customer, user, and public well-being, protects against reputational and brand threats, and aids in anticipating and responding to regulatory and legal requirements. \u2022 Improving well-being: awareness, evidence, infrastructure, and risk management jointly enable organizations to convert learning about well-being into positive improvements to AI design.

The annexes and introduction provide additional guidance around the core components of IEEE 7010, the WIA. The WIA focuses on five activities, each broken down into several tasks, as depicted in 1. These activities and tasks are grounded in stakeholder engagement and an iterative process. Activity 1. Internal analysis and user and stakeholder engagement: The first activity of the WIA focuses on internal evaluation of an AI product or service and information gathering from users and broader stakeholders regarding its possible impacts. In terms of the internal analysis task, organizations should answer five questions involving 1) the nature of the AI system, 2) the needs it meets or problems it solves, 3) who the users (intended and unintended) are, 4) who the broader stakeholders might be, and 5) the likelihood of possible positive and negative impacts, and how can they be considered and mitigated. The internal analysis task allows organizations to have a broad and thoughtful conversation about the purpose and impacts of its AI. This goes beyond considering user experience, as it requires considering the full range of possible impacts for users and stakeholders. (Stakeholders are defined as any individuals or groups who are or might be affected by the AI.)",

These tasks include asking users and stakeholders about how they use or intend to use the AI, and what possible impacts, benefits, and harms they experience or anticipate. The user and stakeholder engagement tasks of IEEE 7010 asks that organizations go well beyond typical user experience and product testing processes, and evaluate the full implications of the AI across its use and lifecycle. For example, organizations that develop AI products for K-12 education should expect to engage with students, teachers, parents, administrators, and potentially other stakeholders. An organization that sells AI products to government entities for use in the criminal justice system should be prepared to engage with government employees and individuals in the criminal justice system.",

Importantly, this first activity and three associated tasks are centered at acquiring evidence surrounding the well-being impacts of a specific AI product or service. As such, organizations should be deliberate about a wide range of possible impacts. To do so, they look to the well-being indicators described in IEEE 7010. The role and selection of well-being indicators is described below. Activity 2. Development and refinement of well-being indicators dashboard: IEEE 7010 identifies indicators of human and societal well-being across multiple dimensions of wellbeing, divided into twelve domains. These domains are affect, community, culture, education, economy, environment, health, human settlements, government, psychological/mental well-being, and work. IEEE 7010 provides sample indicators associated with each domain as well as additional resources through which to identify additional indicators. The well-being indicators within IEEE 7010 are sourced from mainstream evaluative tools for well-being, and are validated by rigorous research. This is a hallmark feature of IEEE 7010.",

IEEE 7010 recognizes that existing indicators of well-being may not adequately reflect the impact of a given organizations AI product or service on human or societal well-being. For example, some indicators focus on measurement of an aspect of well-being at the national level, whereas an AI may impact a smaller number of individuals. IEEE 7010 allows for customization and flexibility when appropriate, while aiming to stay as close as possible to scientifically valid well-being indicators. Activity 3. Data planning and collection: As IEEE 7010 is at heart a WIA, data collection is important. The third activity follows the development or refinement of the wellbeing indicators dashboard. Based on the identified indicators and domains, an organization articulates a data collection plan. This includes collection of both baseline data and data over time, allowing changes in well-being indicators to be assessed over time. The data collection plan task involves organizations describing what data will be collected and how. This includes identifying sources (e.g., which users or stakeholders), methods (e.g., surveys, product metrics), and the frequency and timelines associated with data collection.",

Next, data are collected over time, after users and stakeholders engage with a given AI product or service. Collecting data from multiple populations and over time allows for assessment of actual impacts. IEEE 7010 recognizes that collecting data and associating changes over time with a particular AI product or service is conceptually and empirically challenging. However, the challenge of identifying specific causal impacts should not lead to the abandonment well-being impact assessment, but instead to refine and improve it.",

Data analysis can also illuminate unexpected uses, behaviors, and impacts, and to document how a particular AI product or service was used in real-world settings. Analysis helps determine if an AI does have negative impacts, or if efforts to mitigate negative impacts or increase positive impacts are successful. Importantly, analysis then feeds into improvements to AI design, development, assessment, monitoring, and management. IEEE 7010 does not specify all of the actions that an organization should take, as how an organization learns from the WIA and data depends on the specific product or service, its impacts, and organizational circumstances. However, there are some actions IEEE 7010 recommends towards refining well-being impact assessment, described in activity five. Activity 5. Iteration: IEEE 7010 presents activities that should be performed in an iterative fashion. There are deliberate feedback cycles built in. Assessment of the wellbeing impacts of an AI product or service should not be a one-time effort and should be ongoing. Organizations can use lessons learned from the user and stakeholder engagement process and data analysis to improve the implementation of the well-being assessment process. They should also refine the well-being indicators dashboard as their understanding grows. Improving the assessment process also means strengthening data collection and analysis plan. Over time, organizations should develop capacity towards streamlining WIA, learning how to conceive of impacts more robustly, capture and analyze data more accurately, and efficiently implement changes into engineering, software, and business processes. Finally, organizations can report both internally and externally to users and stakeholders, in order to help assess and communicate progress and opportunities for improvement.",

It has been applied to AI recently by scholars [35] , [80] and IEEEs Ethically Aligned Design includes human rights as indispensable (The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems 2019). IEEE 7010 is consistent with and embraces a human rights perspective. It incorporates assessment of human rights indicators within the domain of government. 4) Fairness, accountability, and transparency: Fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics are referred to as FAT, FATE, FEAT, or similar acronyms. These approaches typically emphasize ethical issues in algorithm design that are seen as technically tractable, especially algorithmic bias and transparency [81] , [82] . This approach is popular amongst computer science and AI ethics researchers, such as the Academy of Computing Machinerys FAccT conference and community. Recently, these communities are opening up to broader perspectives, such as social science, law, and policy [69] . Scholars and practitioners interested in this perspective may find that IEEE 7010 can serve as an important extension to their toolset, one that allows them to conceive of AIs impacts on human and societal well-being more broadly. For example, practitioners of FAT can apply IEEE 7010s WIA and then apply FAT tools and methodologies based on impacts through the WIA and data. 5) Algorithmic impact assessments: Algorithmic impact assessments are sometimes focused on the downstream effects of AI as well as ethical issues during the design stage, as they often heavily feature aspects of FAT. These assessments are promoted by scholars and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) [5] , [83] , and are being considered as part of regulatory frameworks. The European Commission proposed elements of algorithmic assessment within its most recent guidance for the EU [84] , [85] , and the United States has proposed the Algorithmic Accountability Act [86] . IEEE 7010 is highly concordant with this perspective, as it is centered on impact assessment. IEEE 7010s WIA could serve as a tool for policymakers to look to in the near future.",

Other standards, such as those created by national standards bodies, may be legally mandatory. However, voluntary standards can play a role in legal frameworks and have political legitimacy [87] , [88] . For example, adherence to an industry standard can demonstrate good faith efforts beyond minimal levels of compliance and can reduce a companys liability. Moreover, governments and courts of law sometimes give consideration to companies adhering to industry standards when contracting or grant making. For example, the 2016 U.S. National Research and Development (R&D) Plan states that Industry and academia are the primary sources for emerging AI technologies and considers Updating acquisition processes across agencies to include specific requirements for AI standards in requests for proposals [89] . IEEE 7010 may provide a means for companies to demonstrate readiness to adhere to future laws and regulations.",

We recommend that such an IC group be created to help translate the IEEE 7010 standard into practice. 4) Shared language of well-being.

To encourage consensus-building, we further recommend that researchers and practitioners that focus on a single dimension or subset of dimensions of well-being identify their scope of study within this multidimensional definition of well-being. 5) Expanded understanding of well-being. AI creators, managers and investors develop an understanding of the definition of human and societal well-being conceptually and in terms of measurement and data. They should develop a deeper understanding of the impacts on human and societal well-being from AI in general and related to their specific AI work. We further recommend that leading individuals and organizations in the AI field bring conversation about the impacts on human and societal well-being from AI to the forefront through publications, conferences, competitions, and other means. 6) Increased research on AI and well-being. Researchers and practitioners develop the field of knowledge about the impacts of AI on human and societal well-being gathering and analyzing well-being data from users and stakeholders of specific AIs, as well as the general population. We further recommend that AI creators, managers, and investors cooperate with researchers in the gathering and analysis of well-being data and that researchers and practitioners cooperate with each other through sharing of data. We also recommend that researchers, practitioners, and AI creators jointly contribute to the formation of best practices, such as to evolve IEEE 7010 and similar efforts. 7) Educational efforts focused on well-being. Universities develop courses, centers, research programs, and other means of teaching and developing skills for future AI creators, managers, and investors. We recommend that professors and instructors currently teaching AI integrate IEEE 7010 into their curriculum and that university and other educational institutions develop programs and courses which integrate IEEE 7010, with the aim of developing future AI creators, managers, and investors capacity to integrate well-being metrics and goals into their future work. 8) Regulation of AIs impacts on well-being. Governments formulate regulations and standards to contribute to securing and protecting the well-being of humans and society in light of the impacts of AI. We recommend that governments collaborate in the formulation of such standards or regulations as well as develop these independently. We also recommend that international non-governmental organizations facilitate this effort through promulgation of model codes and regulations, as well as issuance of proclamations and resolutions reinforcing their importance, and the coordination of efforts at high-level meetings, summits, and conferences aimed. We recommend that governments adopt a process similar to or based on IEEE 7010 for any development of or investment in AI. Finally, we recommend that governments consider adoption of IEEE 7010 as part of grant making procedures and to demonstrate regulatory compliance.",
