            "text": "Two years after Mom\u2019s death I found myself in Durban, South Africa, on my way to the XIII International AIDS Conference. It seemed like I could not stay away from my connection to HIV/AIDS for very long. Previously, about a year after Mom died, I randomly paid a visit to the hospital where she had spent her last months. The hospital was also home to most of the HIV services in Melbourne, including Positive Women, the first stop on my visit. As I entered the new offices of Positive Women I felt a strange familiarity despite being greeted by a strange face. A new woman was running the organization and for the first time in the organization\u2019s history it was headed by a non-HIV+ woman. We had a long chat and as it turned out that conversation had a profound impact on us both; Stephanie was new to the job, trying to find her way, and I found myself reconnecting. There was a brochure in the office with a group photo of some of the members and I pointed out Mom in the photo. Many of the old faces from Positive Women were still around, including Sonia, a woman whom my Mom had a very close friendship with. From that day onward I started to be involved again in Positive Women\u2019s community activities. The only problem was to logistically work out how I, as a non-HIV+ young woman who was the daughter of a previous member of the organization, could fit in! The rules and regulations of the HIV/AIDS networks had all been put in place to support PLWHAs and to try to provide them with environments where they could feel safe and respected. The problem is that these rules that are meant to provide confidentiality and privacy can often end up adding to the isolation of PLWHAs and widen the divide between their friends, families, and others who genuinely want to be involved.",

The most profound aspect of the conference was realizing that although I had a deep and intimate connection to the issue, my understanding of HIV/AIDS was from a very Australian perspective and I really did not know very much about AIDS in the world. While at the conference I met a young South African man, Neo, who was the first person I had ever met close to my age who shared my same story; he had lost his mother to AIDS. However, the main difference was that Neo\u2019s story was so common in his local community that for him it was hard to find someone who did not share his story. By the end of 2001, the estimated number of adults and children living with HIV in South Africa was five million, while in countries like Australia where the spread of HIV had been relatively contained, a total of approximately 14,000 people living with HIV had been reported by the end of that same year (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS & World Health Organization 2004), Neo was one of many people I met at the conference who had a personal connection to HIV and I saw how many of these people were dedicating their time and efforts to setting up HIV awareness programs to raise awareness in their communities.",

It was the lessons learnt from that experience, however, that facilitated a new way forward for youth involvement at future international gatherings. A Youth Declaration (see Appendix 1) was produced as a result of the forum and was later adopted by UNICEF as a reference in addressing the needs, concerns, and ideas of young people across the Pacific in relation to HIV, their sexual health, and life development opportunities. The greatest lesson learnt was my own: recognizing that I have a place in all of this; and by that I mean I realized that I was going to dedicate a great deal of my energy to improving the opportunity for young people to respond to HIV/AIDS, but I did not realize the shape or depth that commitment was going to take in the years ahead.",

            "text": "Since my first conference experience in Durban I had been contemplating the lack of exposure to HIV/AIDS information within the broader Australian community. In Durban I had been inspired by a small group of young people from South Africa who I had met during the conference. They had developed their own youth peer HIV/AIDS education program because quite simply they were desperate to protect themselves; they were watching their parents, teachers, and whole communities die in front of them. They knew what HIV was and truly believed they could do something about it. Over the next few years that passed since the conference in Durban, I became aware of an increasing number of youth-focused organizations raising awareness around HIV/AIDS. At a point it seemed to me that almost every country I could think of \u2013 and even some I had not geographically heard of before \u2013 were setting up specific programs to educate their youth (that is with the exception of Australia). Historically, Australia had incorporated broad based public awareness of HIV with targeted campaigns as part of its response to the epidemic. But now, it was 2001, and it had been 14 years since the last Australian national HIV/AIDS media campaign had been aired on major commercial radio and television stations. I asked myself: What do the young people who were born after 1987 know about HIV/AIDS, locally and globally? Why does Australia not have a targeted program to deliver HIV/AIDS education to all young people, their parents, teachers, and the media?",

My first thought was of my own experiences: of how I had grown up in a family affected by HIV, of my connection to groups and organizations bound by their common experience of HIV. In terms of the youth in Australia, I knew there were many more young people like me out there, most of whom probably had not had the chance to connect to either the local or the global issues of HIV/AIDS. I also saw the lack of support available to help someone like me through the experience of losing family members to AIDS as unacceptable and thought that maybe my role was to set up a support network for young people in that situation. So, I invested my energy into setting up something that could give young people the tools to understand the issues of HIV and AIDS and know how to respond to them, how to protect themselves and others. I felt this type of community-based service would have greater impact in improving community attitudes to HIV rather than establishing a support service for those young people who had lost someone to HIV/AIDS.",

Although a not-for-profit company is different from a profit based company, both types are registered under the Corporations Act 2001 and have to comply with the regulations and guidelines of the Act (see Appendix 2). The goal would be to register YEAH as a charitable health promotion organization with a deductible gift recipient tax status that would allow the organization to collect donations over AU$2.00 that were tax deductible. The lawyers advised me on how lengthy and tedious the process to obtain this type of company registration and tax status can be and suggested a short term alternative that would allow YEAH to begin operating and raising funds: find a pre-existing organization that already had this type of structure that would be willing to auspice YEAH as a project.

He informed me that Japan was set to host the seventh ICAAP and that the local organizing committee had decided that including a youth component in the conference to build on what was started in Melbourne was an important element of the conference program. The young man invited me to visit Japan some months prior to the conference to assist them with the development of the youth forum and raise awareness amongst Japanese youth to get involved in the program. I made my way to several universities across the country making presentations and running workshops on HIV/AIDS awareness, including information on general issues relating to sexual health. I was already sharing my plans for developing YEAH and my belief in the importance of country-based, youth-run, youth-focused HIV awareness organizations. Several months later I returned to Japan to prepare for ICAAP; however there was an international alert of an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an infectious disease that had spread across several countries in Asia and resulted in a number of reported fatalities. Despite no reports of SARS in Japan, the outbreak became fuel enough for authorities to call for a postponement of the Seventh ICAAP. So it was official \u2013 an infectious disease postponed an infectious disease conference and all those involved in organizing the conference program flew to Japan to see what could be done about the re-scheduling of such a major event.",

YEAH\u2019s relationship with JSA has always illustrated to me the importance of community partnerships and truly reveals corporate responsibility in action.

Jacqui had been a close family friend and was deeply connected to my experience of growing up in a family affected by HIV/AIDS. To watch Jacqui in action was inspirational; she juggled and managed so many people from all walks of life and brought them together to create community events that raised the profile of her cause. A few years earlier it was Jacqui\u2019s guidance that had helped me to see my own capacity in running a series of small HIV/AIDS awareness events at a local homeless shelter. So, naturally, I asked her for her thoughts and advice on coordinating the art auction. It was Jacqui who taught me to think outside of the box, and I remain thankful to her for that gift to this day. I had already approached all of the major art venues in Melbourne, the National Art Gallery and Melbourne Museum to name but two. It seemed that unless you were booking a venue of that scale years in advance, not one site was available. It was early 2004 and I intended to have the show up and running for World AIDS Day, December 1 of that year; time was one thing I did not have on my side.",

I went back to several of the same venues that had already turned me down and after persisting I managed to get a meeting with the manager of Melbourne Museum, Brett Dunlop. This man was clearly willing to give YEAH a chance and we began to explore the options of using alternative areas such as foyer space to host the show.

So, like any good sales person I developed my pitch line, but there was merit in my pitch. I decided that if I expected artists to go out on a limb and support an unknown, yet to be officially founded charity then I should acknowledge their efforts and in turn offer to split the proceeds.

Given that most HIV/AIDS services and organizations are situated close together in each of Australia\u2019s states and territories I thought it would be important for YEAH to be based in and around other health promotion organizations. I wanted to build a reputation in the community that our focus was on health promotion and disease prevention and that HIV/AIDS is an issue that can be dealt with in the same context as other broader health issues, and not just in the isolated context traditionally attached to HIV/AIDS. I approached Professor Rob Moodie, who I had first briefly met at the Sixth ICAAP meeting in Melbourne where he was the co-chair of the conference. At this time Rob was the CEO of VicHealth, the Victorian Center for Innovative Health Promotion. I was well aware that Rob had spent a great deal of his early career working within major international health networks including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and had extensive expertise and a passion for issues around HIV and AIDS.",

As one of the major local hosts, VicHealth was preparing for the upcoming International Conference on Health Promotion and Health Education. Rob was clear that he thought the concept of YEAH as a youth HIV education service was a much needed approach to HIV prevention in Australia. He then introduced me to a small team of young people who were preparing a number of youth-focused activities for the conference and suggested that I play a role in helping set up a youth forum to take place on a number of health issues during the conference program. It sounded familiar and so with great enthusiasm I set to work on coordinating a youth health promotion forum. It was a new experience to be in charge of arranging a forum that would not only have a youth focus but would be covering many health issues from body image to physical and mental health. Sexual health and HIV were of course part of the final program. In hindsight, being in a position to coordinate the forum opened my eyes up for the first time to many core concepts of health promotion; something I was sure I wanted to do through my work with YEAH but until then really had little insight into what it really was; after all I had no academic training and little background in these areas up until this point.",

It was then that I decided to defer my studies and take on a full time voluntary role running YEAH. My decision was driven by the simple fact that if YEAH was to survive and succeed as a community organization it needed someone to run it. The only reason I was able to commit to volunteering full time for a year was that my Mom had left me a small inheritance when she died. Although this was meant to be my safety net to ensure I always had my basic needs covered, I used part of this to financially support myself while I worked without earning a salary. 2005 was the first year of YEAH\u2019s operations, and a number of volunteers assisted me from time to time in the basic running of the organization. But as I have come to learn, despite volunteers being an incredible support, they still require an enormous amount of time to train, monitor, and manage. Given that I was learning the ropes myself, I often found this aspect of managing volunteers a very difficult and exhausting process despite my deep gratitude for their efforts.

I had returned from a trip to Japan in mid-2005 where I finally had the chance to assist with running the Seventh ICAAP youth forum that had been postponed 2 years earlier. By this stage, I was presenting sessions on YEAH\u2019s development as a community-based NGO and in particular the unfolding of the A Closer Walk project. Kate had given me a sense of security in leaving the office unattended for a number of weeks when I needed to and did an incredible job of managing things in my absence. By October 2005, the study guide I had been researching and developing to accompany the DVD release of A Closer Walk was complete. YEAH launched the film with two public theatre screenings in Melbourne and Sydney. Both were followed by question and answers sessions with a panel of people representing various aspects of the Australian HIV/AIDS sector. I was at the Melbourne screening where the panel for the question and answer session included a secondary school teacher and a year 10 student (equivalent to a fourth year high school student). To this day, I remember the impact that their responses to the film had on the audience and I recognized the importance of talking about HIV in a way that the public could connect to, and not just always relying on the experts in the field, despite their extensive knowledge.",

Gina had worked for many years with young people around issues of sexual health and sexuality. She was coordinating a small support network for HIV+ young people in Victoria and was a passionate supporter of YEAH\u2019s work.

The reasoning was simply numbers; Australian statistics showed that although there was a high number of STIs amongst young people, HIV rates were relatively low. The debate and dialogue that I participated in was making it clear to me that simple strategies to improve sexual health, especially amongst young people, needed to be implemented. These were approaches that I had learnt a great deal about though my experience in youth programs over the past seven years, as well as through the work of YEAH. The key point I raised was the government\u2019s absence of youth participation in the dialogue around youth sexual health issues. They simply did not have any type of mechanism to support youth participation in that area. I recommended that empowering young people to be involved in the decision making process of new sexual health strategies could provide the government with insight and understanding into the issues affecting them and their sexual health. On almost every other level, the very people at risk of STIs and HIV have been engaged directly by government; MSM, IDUs, PLWHAs, sex workers. So, where were the young people? I pointed out that the \u201cyoung people\u201d we were all talking about were significantly younger than me; that people in their teenage years, who I work with, even look at me in my 20s and think I am old! My message was clear: it\u2019s time to engage young people in letting \u201cus\u201d know what their needs, concerns, and ideas are in relation to their sexual health. It is time to empower them to own the rights and responsibilities for their sexual health and to move away from negative messages telling them what, when, and how they should approach their sexual development. This was my platform for introducing YEAH to a vast range of key stakeholders. I provided the evidence as to why prevention targeting young people on all sexual health issues, including HIV, was vital for Australia to sustain a strong response to its share of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. After all, it had been 20 years since the government had rolled out its Grim Reaper Campaign, Australia\u2019s infamous HIV/AIDS awareness campaign that had been aired on national radio and television.",

The Board knew that spreading ourselves so thinly across too many initiatives and projects was having a detrimental impact on the work that we were capable of doing well, and therefore the board decided to go through a major strategic review process. The first step was to start by reviewing YEAH\u2019s documentation. Although YEAH had already developed a strategic plan, a board policy, and a number of other core documents, it became clear that many of these had been drafted very early on before YEAH had the chance to experience and experiment with different approaches to delivering its work effectively in the community.",

A typical example of this is the number of undergraduate university students who have completed placements for their health promotion programs/courses working with YEAH. My lack of experience in not knowing how to best utilize the skills of these incredible students (like Kate, Gabby, and Melanie) has been frustrating. These are individuals who have continued to volunteer with YEAH well beyond the end of their placements with the organization. In 2007, I had a new type of volunteer experience, one that had a profound and lasting impact on both YEAH and me personally. Christine Baker had returned to Australia from England and was looking to volunteer her time in an organization during the last few months of her pregnancy. The difference was that Christine had an immense amount of experience in the field of public health and specifically, sexual health. She had worked on a major national sexual health program in the UK and also brought with her a level of professionalism that had been lacking in YEAH\u2019s approach to administration. Her presentation and timing to assist YEAH\u2019s Directors in our review of core documents was perfect. Over several months Christine worked with the Board of Directors and assisted the Board in drafting a complete operations manual. The process was not simply about documenting the history and work procedures of YEAH, but was also a learning process whereby we all had to detail every activity, right through to the high level structure and governance of the organization. The process took the Board on a path from reviewing our goals, through to the delivery mechanisms that would allow YEAH to achieve these goals. The process was extensive and exhausting and worth every minute when I look at the end product. The document that was produced continues to make me proud when I see how it reflects all the work, past and present, which YEAH has been involved with. The Board and all who come into contact with YEAH can be grateful to the wonderful guidance that Christine was able to provide. So my reflection on Christine\u2019s brief but intense involvement with YEAH left me with a sense that miraculous things can happen when the right person presents in the right place and everyone involved is able to recognize that it is the right time.",

I had deferred my medical science degree to set up YEAH and did not have any formal academic qualifications to speak of. Early in 2007, I decided to go back to study; I applied to start my Masters in Public Health, despite not having finished my undergraduate course, and was fortunate to be granted a place. As I began studying epidemiology, statistics, public health, and the social sciences, I realized just how connected all my experiences were to the material we were covering in class. In our tutor groups, I always seemed to have stories to share about experiences that reflected the topics we were discussing: biomedical approaches to health versus psychosocial models; the impact of culture and social class on health; anthropology; social movements; health promotion; professional care; chronic illness narratives; stigma in health; research methods in public health; evidence-based medicine; and the list goes on! All the while I was engaging and learning the material, I was also having a profound realization: I did not know the theory, but in many cases I knew the content. I had lived many of these experiences. I had worked in an area that had allowed me to witness many of these experiences. I have a great deal to still learn, that is for sure.

It was through one such network, Leadership Victoria, that YEAH was able to successfully appoint Peter Caillard as the new Chairperson of our Board of Directors. Peter, a former recipient of Australia\u2019s corporate lawyer of the year award brought with him a level of professionalism and energy that has both complemented and elevated YEAH\u2019s capacity around governance and strategic direction. The positive experience of advertising for the position of Chairperson prompted YEAH to use similar methods to advertise for the role of treasurer. In late 2008, Amanda Campbell, a Charted Accountant and Director of a major consultancy firm was successfully appointed to the role and the addition of the two new directors culminated in a feeling of achieving a new balance of skills represented at the board level. In addition, YEAH\u2019s Directors decided to invite Sue Podhorsky, the volunteer who had been tirelessly taking YEAH\u2019s board minutes for the past year, to officially accept the role of Secretary; and so, in a matter of months, the board had not only grown but had developed into a robust and reinvigorated team.",

The lessons that had been learnt during the appointment of our two new board members made me realize there was an opportunity to approach volunteer recruitment in the same way; to advertise specific position descriptions that would attract the right candidates with appropriate skills and time to commit to the role. This approach proved to be extremely effective and for the first time, it was YEAH that was driving the direction of our volunteers, not simply me trying to create opportunities for people who wanted to be involved. This is clearly how the commercial world works; by advertising employment opportunities that fit within the company\u2019s strategic direction and growth; therefore why should not the community sector embrace the same approach (albeit without the financial remuneration)?

This project is intrinsically linked to the Board\u2019s decision to consider a range of ways to improve the opportunity for community involvement in the decision making processes of YEAH. One such option currently under review is the implementation of a public membership program. While this is currently in a research phase, the concept would allow individuals, educational institutes, organizations, and other stakeholders to become members of YEAH, giving members the right to vote on strategic decisions and ensuring a strong community voice in shaping the future direction of YEAH. The research phase of the project is being lead by Dr. Andrew Smith and Denis O\u2019Hara, members of Leadership Victoria\u2019s Experience Bank program. The program centres on connecting senior practitioners from across a range of industries and professions with opportunities to share their expertise with community-based organizations.
