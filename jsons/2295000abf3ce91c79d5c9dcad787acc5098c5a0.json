            "text": "Advances in diagnostic testing for transplant-related infections, particularly molecular viral diagnostic assays, constitute one of the most notable changes in transplant infectious disease over the last two decades [1, 2] . This chapter discusses recent developments in diagnostics for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), BK virus (BKV), community respiratory viruses (CRVs), parvovirus, hepatitis viruses, HIV, and other viral agents of importance in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The recent debate regarding the extent of nucleic acid amplification (NAT) testing for HIV, HBV, and HCV in proposed transplant donors is reviewed [3] . Different uses for molecular viral tests in the transplant recipient are discussed, ranging from facilitation of antiviral preventive strategies to determination of length of therapy for active infections. The advantages and disadvantages of single vs. multiplex assays are explored [2] . Challenges in this field include interlaboratory variation [4] , management of false-positive and discordant test results, and need for consensus on which patients should receive which testing, at what intervals, and for what period of time. Despite these challenges, molecular viral diagnostics have clearly contributed significantly to the reduction of infectious morbidity, by enabling early diagnosis and intervention, resulting in such notable examples as the reduction in severe CMV disease [5, 6] and in kidney allograft loss due to BKV [7] . Future clinical trials in the field of transplantation should incorporate accepted definitions of infection and practices of viral monitoring for transplant-associated viruses [8] .",

            "text": "The term \"serology\" or \"serologic test\" refers in general to an assay which detects an antibody to a specific pathogen, usually IgG or IgM. A panel of serologic tests is performed on both donor and recipient prior to transplantation. The results may be used to disqualify a prospective donor or to restrict the use of the donor to a specific subgroup of recipients or more commonly may be used for risk stratification and posttransplant management for particular infections (e.g., the donor-seropositive, recipient-seronegative or D+/Rgroup which is the subgroup at the highest risk for both CMV and EBV, respectively, in solid organ transplantation) [9] . Serologies are of limited value in diagnosing active infections in the posttransplant patient, since immunosuppressed patients may not mount an IgM response even in the setting of an active infection and some recipients with de novo posttransplant hypogammaglobulinemia have globally low IgG levels [10] . IgG serology remains positive for life, and pathogen-specific IgG titers do not usually correlate with the activity of infection, so obtaining an IgG level (for CMV or EBV, among others) is not generally helpful in diagnosing an acute illness in a transplant recipient (an exception is when the clinician wants to know if a previously seronegative patient has seroconverted, which might have prognostic value, for example, in predicting ongoing risk for recurrences of CMV viremia) [11] .",

            "text": "Antigen-based testing, such as the pp65 antigenemia test for CMV, does have a potential role in posttransplant recipients, as this is a direct detection of the virus and not a reflection of the patient's immune response to the virus [12, 13] . However, in most cases, antigen detection is semiquantitative and does not provide an exact viral load to follow over time. In addition, some antigen tests (such as the pp65 antigenemia test for CMV) decay with time, and thus lose sensitivity, if the sample is mailed into a central laboratory or if there is a delay between obtaining the blood sample and laboratory performance of the test. Molecular testing has revolutionized viral diagnosis in transplantation [14] [15] [16] . Molecular diagnostic tests are generally highly sensitive assays that directly detect the virus' genetic material such as DNA or RNA (depending on the type of virus) and can be qualitative or quantitative. There are a variety of methodologies, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technologies, hybrid capture assay, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), transcriptionmediated amplification (TMA), and others [1, 2, 17, 18] . Performance characteristics of some of these tests in comparative studies are shown in Table 49 .1. Testing may be monoplex (a single pathogen tested at one time) or multiplex (which refers to several or many pathogens tested in one sample).",

A list of potential uses for quantitative molecular diagnostic tests is shown in Table 49 .2.

This assay is specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and avoids false-positive results due to BCG vaccination, as with the tuberculin skin test [20] . Similar assays for CMV and BKV have been an area of intense research interest. Recent results suggest that measurement of CMV-specific immune function is useful in risk stratification of high-risk organ transplant recipients [21] and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [22] . It is likely that these tests will be more commonly used in the future in transplant virology, with an eye to devising personalized prevention programs using assessments of individual patients' pathogen-specific immunity. However, testing for virus-specific cell-mediated immunity has not yet become widely performed at the time of this writing, so the current chapter will focus mainly on molecular diagnostic testing.",

            "text": "CMV remains one of the most common viruses to reactivate in the posttransplant patient. In the early years of transplantation, diagnosis of CMV infection relied on detection of viral growth in tissue culture, which was laborious and could take several weeks for a positive result to be obtained, particularly if the samples have low viral load. The advent of shell-vial centrifugation culture methodology shortened the turnaround time from 4-5 days to 48 h, but this test was less sensitive at lower viral loads and did not provide quantitative results [13] . The pp65 antigenemia test was then devised, and multiple studies have validated its utility in posttransplant monitoring and as a basis for preemptive therapy [12, 13, 23] . The pp65 antigenemia test detects CMV-infected white blood cells in peripheral blood using a fluorescent assay which requires the laboratory technician to visually scan the slide and to report the number of positive (infected) cells per unit of area. It is thus a semiquantitative test. Although this does give some idea of the magnitude of the viral load, it is not as definitive in viral load measurement as quantitative molecular tests, which are usually expressed as DNA copies/ml or, most recently, in international units. The pp65 antigenemia assay is laborintensive for the laboratory and thus may be problematic for transplant centers with very high volumes of tests. In addition, the results decay after obtaining the blood sample, so it is less suitable for mailing in to a central laboratory from patients who live a long distance away from the transplant center. Molecular diagnostic tests for CMV have largely supplanted previous tests at many centers. Their quantification of the blood viral load, ease of handling high volumes of samples, and lack of decay with time if properly handled make the CMV DNA by PCR a useful choice for a transplant center with high volumes of samples and/or patients outside the immediate area. Quantitative viral loads often correspond to severity of disease, although interlaboratory variation has hampered the attempt to describe universal cutoff values for clinical categories and decision-making [4, 24, 25] . In solid organ transplant recipients, tissue-invasive CMV episodes generally have the highest viral loads (e.g., >50,000-100,000 copies/ml); asymptomatic viremia has the lowest viral loads (e.g., <5000 copies/ml); and the intermediate category of \"CMV syndrome\" has viral loads in between the other two categories, although exceptions may occur. However, widespread adoption of the WHO standard should allow for more reliable, shared correlations between viral loads and clinical manifestations, after the initial period of clinician adjustment to a new scale [25] . The quantification of the viral load also allows for following levels over time, so that treatment decisions, including when to initiate antiviral therapy, when to discontinue antiviral therapy, or when to switch from fulldose therapy to secondary suppressive dose prophylaxis, can be based on serial results of these quantitative tests (Table 49. 2). A notable example of the use of sequential viral load measurements is the use of a risk-adapted, CMV viral load-based preemptive therapy program for CMV prevention in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, utilized at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center [26] .",

A highly developed system must be in place, particularly for preemptive therapy, for the loss of even one sample or failure to act upon one sample result might lead to full-blown symptomatic infection. But perhaps the most problematic aspect is that of interlaboratory variation [4, 24, 25] , depending on the use of whole blood versus plasma; commercial versus individually developed assays, different reagents, and primers; and a host of other factors. The American Society of Transplantation (AST)'s Infectious Disease Community of Practice, together with the Canadian Society of Transplantation, published an interlaboratory comparison of CMV PCR testing involving 33 laboratories, showing wide variation in results (between a 2-and 4-log 10 copies/ml difference in some cases) and need for more standardization [4] . The World Health Organization (WHO)'s standardization initiative should help to ameliorate this situation and to improve the comparability of viral loads obtained in different laboratories. As of 2010, the WHO announced an international standard for CMV molecular testing, which enables laboratories to calibrate their assays and which involves reporting in international units per mL [25] . Another recent development, in 2012, was the first FDA approval of a quantitative CMV PCR test (the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan CMV test or CAP/CTM CMV test) which is a fully automated test, and the one copy of CMV DNA (as defined by the COBAS\u00ae AmpliPrep/COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae CMV test) is equivalent to 0.91 international unit (IU) on the First WHO International Standard for Human Cytomegalovirus for Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NIBSC 09/162) [19, 25] . An international multicenter comparison of the CAP/CTM CMV test in five laboratories at transplant centers compared the performance of this test with local assays, using blinded samples and clinical specimens [19] . This study showed high interlaboratory agreement of the CAP/ CTM test and quantification differences using local assays [19] . It has been suggested that this test might serve as the basis for more widely accepted cutoffs for prediction of CMV disease and thresholds for preemptive therapy [25] .",

CMV antiviral resistance commonly occurs in two sites, known as UL97 and UL54 [27, 28] . UL97 relates to the ability of a viral-encoded thymidine kinase to initiate triphosphorylation of ganciclovir to its active form, and thus UL97 mutations confer resistance to ganciclovir but not to foscarnet or cidofovir. UL54 mutations, on the other hand, affect the viral DNA polymerase and so may confer resistance to ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir or more than one of these [27, 28] . Phenotypic resistance testing is less commonly used now, as it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Genotypic resistance testing should be obtained in any clinical situation where resistance is suspected, such as a persistently high CMV viral load, failure of the viral load to decrease on therapy, or clinical lack of response to therapy after sufficient time has elapsed.",

            "text": "The utility of EBV serologic testing such as EBV VCA-IgG is principally in the pretransplant period, establishing whether or not the donor and the recipient have ever been infected with EBV. Most adults, 90% or greater, are EBVseropositive, although pediatric transplant recipients are more likely to be seronegative [29] . As with CMV, the donor and recipient serogroups carry differential risks for the development of serious infections. In the case of EBV, the main issue is risk for EBV-related posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The highest-risk category in solid organ transplantation is the EBV D+/R-category; as similar to the case of CMV, there is no antecedent immunity in the recipient, but a viral load is acquired from the donor at the time of transplantation [29] . Knowledge of this D+/R-status may allow for closer surveillance, modulation of immunosuppression, and, at some centers, serial monitoring of the EBV DNA viral load [30, 31] . There are several different EBV serologies that are commonly performed: the Epstein-Barr nuclear antibody (EBNA), Epstein-Barr early antigen (EA), viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, and VCA-IgM. Of these, the VCA-IgG is the most reliable test for assessing whether or not the patient is seropositive (i.e., whether they have ever had EBV infection), while the VCA-IgM correlates better with current or recent disease although IgM response may be blunted in an immunocompromised host, so there is limited utility in ordering EBV serologies in patients following transplantation. For the diagnosis of active EBV infection and the assessment of PTLD risk, obtaining quantitative blood PCR testing is more helpful than serologies [29, 30] . EBV DNA viral loads may be performed on plasma or on whole blood. As in the case of CMV, interlaboratory variation also exists with respect to EBV DNAemia measurement [24] . EBV DNA viral loads may be followed over time in high-risk patients and may be useful as a gauge of the degree of success of interventions such as reduction of immunosuppression, which should be followed by a corresponding decrease in the EBV DNA blood viral load, unless the patient has active PTLD. Green et al. have demonstrated the predictive value of this monitoring [30] , and McDiarmid has shown the utility of EBV DNA monitoring, coupled with reduction of immunosuppression and ganciclovir therapy, in the reduction of PTLD risk (from 10% to 5%) in a cohort of pediatric liver transplant recipients [31] . Successful therapy of PTLD with rituximab or rituximab plus combination chemotherapy is often associated with a rapid fall of the EBV DNA blood viral load to undetectable levels. However, later rebounds of EBV DNAemia may occur and do not necessarily portend recurrences of PTLD [30] .",

Between the time that HBsAg becomes undetectable and anti-HBs appears, there is a \"window period\" during which time neither is detectable, but the HBV core IgM antibody (anti-HBc IgM) and HBV DNA are detectable. After natural infection, the anti-HBc IgM disappears and the anti-HBc IgG appears, so persons in whom HBV infection has been successfully controlled by the immune system generally are positive for both anti-HBc and anti-HBs, but negative for HBsAg. In about 10% of infected individuals, antibody seroconversion does not occur and the HBsAg is persistently positive in chronic infection. Such individuals may progress to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma and may require a liver transplant with the goal of eradicating HBV infection, utilizing posttransplant prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) and an anti-HBV antiviral agent such as entecavir.

The risk of transmission of HCV from a seropositive donor to a na\u00efve recipient varies in different series, but has been reported to be as high as 75% in some studies [48] . An HCV-seropositive, HCV RNA-negative donor appears to be less likely to transmit HCV than a donor with detectable HCV RNA, but further data are awaited. Unlike the HBV core-positive donor, until recently the risk could be mitigated by prior immunization since there is no vaccine for HCV. Thus, transplantation from an HCV-seropositive donor to an HCV-seronegative recipient (HCV D+/R-) was usually reserved for situations where other donor offers were unlikely, with stringent informed consent [9] . However, the advent of effective HCV therapy is expected to change practice rapidly.",

These recipients are chosen because their kidney or liver disease is more clinically significant than their HIV-related illness, they have not had certain HIV-related opportunistic infections, and their HIV viral loads are well controlled except in the case of some liver candidates who could not tolerate antiviral therapy in the setting of end-stage liver disease.

In recent years it has become possible to perform this testing in the rapid time frame needed for making decisions about whether or not to accept a deceased donor, including nights and weekends. The availability of NAT has spurred a national debate in the United States regarding whether all potential deceased donors should be subjected to NAT for HIV/HBV/HCV or just those in the CDC-specified high-risk categories including sexual promiscuity, injection drug use, incarceration, and other categories of behavioral risk. A survey of OPOs revealed a heterogeneity of practices in this regard, with some OPOs performing NAT on all donors, some on a subset of donors, and some not at all [64] . In 2010, an expert consensus panel recommended restricting NAT to donors in the above risk categories, citing concerns about false-positive testing that could lead to discarding otherwise potentially acceptable donors and thus leading to increased deaths on the waiting list for transplantation [3] . Then in the fall of 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Public Health Service (USPHS) published a comprehensive guideline which recommended NAT of all deceased donors and also retesting of potential living donors shortly before intended donation. After discussion within the transplant community, these recommendations were revised, and the current guidelines call for HCV NAT testing of all donors, with HIV NAT testing only of PHS/CDC high-risk donors, and with a revised list of risk categories [65] . All parties in this discussion are interested in protecting potential organ recipients from harm; the differences in opinion arose in balancing the risks of donor-derived transmission versus the risks of disqualifying donors through false-positive testing.",

In addition, the existence of a large number of respiratory viruses that produce similar symptomatology makes the use of a respiratory virus multiplex a natural one [2] . Potential advantages of a multiplex assay on blood or plasma would include the following: less blood drawn from the recipient for blood assays, detection of unsuspected coinfections, and rapid and sometimes quantitative results to facilitate preemptive strategies. The cost-effectiveness of multiplex testing has been evaluated in a study by Mahony et al., in which four strategies were compared for diagnosis of respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients (direct fluorescent antibody or DFA alone, DFA plus shell-vial culture, the xTAG RVP test alone, or the xTAG RVP test plus DFA) [66] .

Potential disadvantages of multiplex testing of disparate viruses, for example, a panel that includes CMV, EBV, and BK virus and others, also include the clinical quandary of what to do with low-level positive results or results in a subgroup of patients in whom a particular virus is of less clinical importance like BKV in non-kidney organ transplant recipients. For certain subgroups of patients, all of the assays on a multiplex test might provide valuable information; but for others, the clinicians may be interested in only one or two viruses. In that situation, should the information on detection of the other viruses be routinely provided in laboratory reports? These and other questions remain to be fully addressed. The issue of cost also needs careful scrutiny. Costs could potentially decrease because of ordering fewer tests if the clinicians intended originally to monitor more than one virus, but costs could also increase if the cost of the multiplex assay exceeds that of the single-virus assay for clinicians who intended to monitor only one virus. Mahony et al. reported the cost-effectiveness may also depend on the prevalence of the viral infections being tested and so may vary from one region to another or one season to another [66] .",

The utility of quantitative molecular testing is supported by a variety of studies and facilitates the timing of starting and stopping antiviral therapy, assessing the effectiveness of therapy, monitoring for recurrences of viremia, and deciding when to test for antiviral resistance. Multiplex testing for panels of respiratory viruses has demonstrated utility and cost-effectiveness in certain scenarios. The use of NAT in potential deceased and living donors is promising for reduction of donor-derived transmission from donors in the window period of HIV, HBV, and HCV infection, but the recent vigorous national debate, regarding whether all or a subset of potential donors should be subjected to NAT, reflects the complexity of the issues involved.
