Checkley and associates demonstrated that prenatal maternal supplementation with retinol improved lung function in their offspring.8 A meta\u2010analysis of vitamin A supplementation identified nine clinical trials in children aged 6 months to 7 years old, and only two studies demonstrated that vitamin A supplementation protected against the lower respiratory tract infection.9 Other studies showed an adverse effect of vitamin A supplementation on respiratory tract infection.10 A more recent meta\u2010analysis showed that lower vitamin A intake was associated with increased odds of asthma and wheezing.11\n",

We hypothesized (a) that adequate vitamin A is required for airway epithelial repair after injury and (b) that the effects of VAD may be more readily discerned in an acute illness which primarily involves the conducting airways (rather than the alveolar region as in pneumonia). To address this hypothesis we studied children age 3 through 7 in a region of Brazil where children are at risk for VAD. The primary outcomes were the level of total respiratory resistance (TRR) during and its normalization after recovery from an acute upper respiratory illness. Serum retinol and the modified relative dose response (MRDR) were determined during the acute illness, to assess the relationship between vitamin A status and changes in pulmonary function during an upper respiratory infection). We found that children with lower vitamin A had a lag in normalization of airway resistance after an upper respiratory infection (URI).",

Two pediatric pulmonologists enrolled all of the subjects, administered the questionnaire, and confirmed that those enrolled met all of the enrollment criteria. The children comprised three groups: (a) acute upper respiratory infection (URI, n = 74), the URI children had symptoms of sore throat and or pharyngeal erythema within 7 days prior to enrollment and were without signs of pneumonia or wheezing on physical examination; (b) upper respiratory infections and wheezing (URI\u2010wheezing, n = 52) children with symptoms of URI and wheezing on presentation; and (c) healthy controls, who had no respiratory symptoms for 4 weeks prior to enrollment (n = 51). Controls were children who came to the clinic with their parent or guardian, accompanying another child who was seeking medical assistance. The control children did not have any immediate health complaints and had no symptoms of a respiratory illness during the last four weeks. The required number of subjects per group was estimated, based on the prevalence of sub\u2010clinical vitamin A deficiency in this population and on predicted changes in the total respiratory resistance (TRR). The original estimate predicted that 65 cases and controls were required to achieve a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. We ultimately enrolled 51 controls and 74 URI\u2010without wheezing patients. After most of the patients in these groups had been enrolled, it became apparent that very few URI\u2010without wheezing patients had a TRR > 150% predicted. Therefore a third group was enrolled, comprised of 52 children who had wheezing at initial presentation with a URI and whose TRR was significantly elevated. A questionnaire addressing respiratory health, history of atopy,15 home environment was completed by the caregiver of the children. The subject and their accompanying caregiver were asked to report what the child had eaten for each meal during the prior 24 hr, and specifically questioned whether they consumed foodstuffs that contain retinol or carotenoids (milk, margarine, carrots, a particular squash available in Northeast Brazil, eggs, fruit juice, meat, and green leafy vegetables).16 Anthropometric measurements were obtained and a complete physical examination was performed. The analog balance and stadiometer that were used to assess weight and height were produced by Filizola Co. (Brazil) and were graduated in 100 g and 1 mm, respectively. The children were weighed by a trained nursing assistant and their clothing was not removed prior to weighing. Children with a diagnosis of pneumonia (based on rales, fever and/or chest radiograph, vitamin supplementation within the prior 6 months, or oxygen saturation <92% were excluded. This protocol and consent documents were reviewed and approved by the Human Subjects Committee at the University of Iowa (the awarded institution), the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte Ethical Committee (CEP\u2010UFRN 96\u201003) and by the Brazilian National Ethical Committee (CONEP 808\u20102005). Guardians of the participating children provided consent on behalf of the participants.",

The blood was kept on ice, protected from ambient light, and serum was frozen at \u221280\u00b0. Five hundred microliters of serum were supplemented with retinol acetate as an internal standard. After deproteination using ethanol, the serum was extracted twice with 0.75 ml of hexane. The extract was dried under a stream of nitrogen in the dark. After dissolving the lipid extract in ethanol, retinol, didehydroretinol and retinol acetate were resolved using isocratic HPLC.18 Retinol and didehydroretinol standards were prepared from retinol acetate and DRA, respectively and used to calibrate each run.

The subjects in the URI group without wheezing, whose MRDR was >0.06, did not show a reduction in TRR after resolution of symptoms, whereas subjects whose MRDR was <0.06 had a significant reduction in their TRR after their symptoms resolved (Table 6).",

In the URI group only 18.8% had retinol <20 \u00b5g/dl, but the MRDR exceeded 0.06 in 58% of the subjects, indicating low liver reserves. The MRDR and retinol were both normal in the control group. Observing a group mean MRDR in a vitamin A\u2010sufficient range but mean serum retinol in a deficient may represent a decline in retinol related to the current URI. We observed a weak, although significant, inverse linear relationship between RBP and CRP when the URI and URI\u2010wheezing groups were combined (P = 0.0285, R = 0.27). This suggests that the lower retinol in these groups correlates with lower availability of its serum carrier protein (RBP). There was a significant positive correlation between albumin and RBP (P = 0.023, R = 0.331) in the URI\u2010wheezing group, suggesting that these subjects had a decline in a second liver\u2010derived protein, in addition to RBP. Therefore diminished synthesis may have contributed to the lower RBP in the URI\u2010wheezing group. Others have shown that serum retinol may decline because of a short\u2010term increase in renal clearance (even if the CRP remains <5 mg/L), without depletion of the larger retinyl ester storage pool in the liver.25 The percentage saturation of transferrin with iron showed a trend towards being lower in the URI\u2010wheezing group, although the iron content did not differ from the control and URI\u2010groups.",

The overall mean MRDR for the URI\u2010wheezing group was similar to controls, but more children in the URI\u2010wheezing group had retinol between 10 and 20 \u00b5g/dl than in the other two groups. In children hospitalized for pneumonia, Stephensen and associates observed that a smaller percentage of children with a CRP exceeding 10 mg/L exhibited lower estimated liver stores (by the relative dose response test) than did children with CRP <10 mg/L.33 Thus others have encountered disparities between liver stores and circulating retinol during a more severe respiratory illness.",

A less severe acute illness may account for the observation of a normal mean retinol. Fifty\u2010eight percent of the children without wheezing had a MRDR > 0.06 during the URI, whereas this was observed in only one child with wheezing, and in none of the controls. As an assessment of liver stores, the MRDR is a time\u2010average of vitamin A intake over months rather than weeks or days. Only two children in the URI\u2010group and two in the URI\u2010wheezing group had symptoms for more than 7 days, making it unlikely that liver stores diminished during the acute illness. Therefore, estimated liver stores in URI\u2010children were chronically lower than in the URI\u2010wheezing and control groups. Because this was unanticipated, we evaluated several potential explanations. No children were supplemented with vitamin A during the 6 months prior to enrollment, and 29.4% and 16.0% of children in the control and URI\u2010groups, respectively, had received vitamin A between 6 and 12 months prior to enrollment. Differences in diet, not discerned by the 24\u2010hr recall may have contributed. Most of the children in the URI\u2010 and URI\u2010wheezing groups were enrolled during the rainy season (April through August). However the peak enrollment for the control group was during January through March. Seasonal vitamin A\u2010rich fruits and vegetables may have been more readily available during October through January, just prior to enrollment of the majority of the control children. We also assessed the correlation between the MRDR and absolute blood eosinophil count. A larger fraction of the children in the URI group had eosinophils at the high end of the range compared to the other two groups (see E\u2010Figure 1). This suggests that intestinal helminthes may have been more prevalent in children of the URI group. Intestinal helminthes deplete hepatic vitamin A stores, resulting in increased MRDR which can be normalized by deworming.34, 35\n",

Similar to others, we observed a coefficient of variation (CV) for the combined R5Hz (TRR) measurements in all subjects of 9%.37 The mean change in TRR between the first and second encounter was 34% for the URI\u2010wheezing and 19% for the URI groups respectively, which is greater than the CV of the within the same day measurements.

Although TRR remained within the normal range for all children with URI and without wheezing, it decreased significantly during recovery only in children in the URI group whose MRDR was <0.06. In the URI\u2010group, children with the most elevated MRDR had the smallest decline in TRR during convalescence (Table 6). However, within the URI\u2010wheezing group, the convalescent decline in TRR was not less in those children with lower serum retinol. The lower retinol in the URI\u2010wheezing group may result from an inflammatory response. Children in the URI\u2010wheezing group with the highest MRDR did not show a diminished normalization of TRR after recovery from their URI symptoms. Two factors may contribute to this variance from the group of children with URI but without wheezing. First, there was only one child in the URI\u2010wheezing cohort whose MRDR exceeded 0.06. And second, the convalescent incremental decrease in TRR was much greater in the URI\u2010wheezing group. This suggests that in this group, in which nearly all children had a prior history of asthma, other contributors to airway inflammation and wheezing, may have obscured a more subtle effect of vitamin A. An alternate interpretation of our findings is that the lower mean MRDR (and presumably more abundant vitamin A reserves) in the URI\u2010wheezing compared to the URI group predisposes the children to wheezing, as others observed in mice, which were sensitized to ovalbumin.14 Although airway eosinophils increase in asthmatics during a URI, neutrophils and Th1 T\u2010cells also increase, which differs from the ovalbumin model in mice where changes are almost exclusively observed in airway eosinophils.38, 39\n",

However our findings may be interpreted in light of recent findings about how retinoids influence the airway immune response. Allergic, Th2\u2010driven inflammation is a hallmark of asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity. Studies in mice suggest that retinoic acid (RA, an important biologically active vitamin A\u2010metabolite) establishes and maintains forkhead box (Fox)P3+ regulatory T\u2010cells (Treg).40 Along with transforming growth factor \u03b2 and rapamycin, RA can reprogram Th2 cells into FoxP3+ Tregs, and reduce airway inflammation. A recent study of Ecuadorian children showed that circulating FoxP3+ Tregs diminish prior to age 5 years as differentiated CD4 and CD8 T\u2010cells increase.41 Poor vitamin A nutriture during the first 5 years of life may enhance the loss of Tregs and afford reduced protection against airway reactivity.",
