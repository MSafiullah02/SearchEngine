After my experience rounding on critically ill patients with H1N1 in Mexico and several South American countries in 2009 ( 3 ), I proposed a new definition of pandemics -a response to an infectious threat that requires International surge capacity ( 4 ) . An implication is that countries share data comfortably, so that we'll have baselines for every emerging pandemic. Two key elements of pandemics are efficient transmission and disease severity. I could imagine 3-4 grades of pandemics, based on metrics such as the incremental surge capacity needed for personal protective equipment, diagnostic testing, ventilators, medical personnel, percent of GDP and others.",

Author Nissan Taleb would say that we shouldn't try to predict when or how severe the next pandemic will be, but instead to build robustness into the system. Based on his assessment of the tragic Fukushima nuclear accident (built to withstand the worst reported earthquake in japan, but not the 9.0 category one that surprisingly hit), he would say, don't try to prepare for the worst pandemic experienced, but imagine the next one worse than any seen previously (1).",

We still don't know what parts of social isolation work, how effective surgical masks vs N-95 masks are, and when and where each should be used. What are the proportional sizes of droplets expelled by infected patients when they cough, sneeze, talk? How far do they travel, and do all large droplets (over 10 microns) fall to the ground or evaporate before six feet? Could some patients produce prominent aerosols, facilitating their being \"super spreaders\"? What proportions of transmissions occurred from aerosol vs larger droplets? How important is the contaminated environment? Our failure to learn from prior experiences has handicapped us. A research rapid response team with predesigned outlines of protocols to be implemented early in a pandemic would be invaluable. Avedis Donabedian, the father of quality health care suggested the pillars for grading our efforts: structure, process, and outcome ( 5 ). To achieve optimal outcomes, we should institute robust structures and efficient and effective processes to respond next time: reinstate the disbanded Predict Program, the systematic surveillance and cataloguing of new viruses that might leap to people; design a large surge capacity for ventilation equipment, personal protection equipment, testing kits; and reinstate a form of the disbanded White House pandemic response team. A careful review of the budget for CDC would help assure the adequacy of public health response to new pandemics.",

In receiving reports, citizens want the facts, and most appreciate the limited data available -what is and isn't known, but they need to learn what assumptions are driving current policy. The communicator needs to be skilled in the nuanced lexicon of uncertainty. Rigorous training sessions with mock pandemic responses should be repeatedly rehearsed. We should be able to answer who's in charge, who's the primary communicator, and what measures are in place to measure the incremental surge capacities needed.",

He responds, \"This whole thing is not about heroism...it may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency...doing my job.\" ( 2 ) Whenever Covid-19 is declared over, we'll have much to celebrate about individual decency and courage as we in the field of Infectious Diseases incorporated cherished values : Truth, Empathy, Ethics, and Justice. But as a nation, with respect to structure, process, outcomes, and values, let's ask ourselves, How Did We Do? Are we ready for tomorrow's pandemic?",
