Diagnostic utility of serum albumin to globulin ratio for the diagnosis of FIP was greater than of the utility of serum total protein and \u2425-globulin concentrations. Diagnostic utility of these variables was higher when performed on effusion. On effusion, positive and negative predictive values of Rivalta's test, a test that distinguishes between exudates and transudates (0.86 and 0.97), anti-coronavirus antibody detection (0.90 and 0.79), and immunofluorescence staining of coronavirus antigen in macrophages (1.00 and 0.57) were investigated. The positive and negative predictive values of presence of anti-coronavirus antibodies were 0.44 and 0.90, respectively, antibody concentrations (1 : 1,600) were 0.94 and 0.88, presence of immune complexes measured by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were 0.67 and 0.84, and detection of viral RNA by serum reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were 0.90 and 0.47. Effusion RT-PCR was performed in 6 cats; it was positive in all 5 cats with FIP and negative in the cat with another disease. Diagnostic assays on the fluid in cats with body effusion had good predictive values. Definitive diagnosis of FIP on the basis of measurement of various variables in serum was not possible. Serum tests can only be used to facilitate the decision for more invasive diagnostic methods.",

            "text": "F eline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common disease and a frequent reason for referral; approximately 1 of every 200 new feline cases presented to American Veterinary Teaching Hospitals represent cats with FIP. 1 FIP is a fatal, immune-mediated disease, triggered by infection with a feline coronavirus (FCoV). 2 FCoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, a group of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that are frequently found in cats. Coronavirusspecific antibodies are present in 80-90% of cats in catteries and in 10-50% of those in single-cat households. [3] [4] [5] [6] However, only 5-10% of FCoV-infected cats develop FIP in a cattery situation; a much lower incidence occurs in single-cat households. 3, 7 FIP is a deadly disease with no effective long-term management. A rapid and reliable diagnosis is critical for prognostic reasons to lessen suffering of affected patients while avoiding euthanasia of unaffected cats. Difficulties in definitively diagnosing FIP arise from nonspecific clinical signs, lack of pathognomonic hematological and biochemical abnormalities and low sensitivity and specificity of tests routinely used in practice. Diagnostic value of most of the described variables is only known in experimental settings, and some tests have not been widely used in clinical patients. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values, of different clinicopathologic variables and virological methods used to diagnose FIP in clinical cases.",

Buffered solution was pipetted into a microtiter plate containing a FIP-producing FCoV strain (DF-2 WT FIPV) and was incubated.

The rationale for including surviving cats in the control group was the fact that a cat suffering from clinically evident FIP will not live for 12 months, as there is no effective treatment 24 and the course of disease results in death within this time period. In previous retrospective studies to identify serologic, biochemical, and hematological markers of FIP, there were differences in the way the data were evaluated and in the prevalence of disease in the populations examined. 18, 20, [25] [26] [27] [28] In this study, cases in which FIP was considered a major differential diagnosis were selected as control for comparison. As a consequence, the prevalence might be different than in other studies, a fact that dramatically alters the predictive values. The purpose of this selection was to identify predictive values that mimic the real situation in which a clinician has FIP as a differential diagnosis in mind. This is more representative than studies in which the whole clinic population, or healthy cats, or cats with 1 specific disease other than FIP are used as control groups.",

Antibody titers and hypergammaglobulinemia show a linear correlation, but the wide variation in anti-FCoV titers at a given concentration of \u2425-globulins indicates that additional (immune-mediated) reactions occur in the pathogenesis of FIP 34 and that other mechanisms like IL-6-induced activation of plasma cells contribute to the hypergammaglobulinemia. 35 In this study, comparison (ROC curve analysis and LR) of total serum protein concentration, \u2425-globulin concentration, and albumin to globulin ratio revealed that the albumin to globulin ratio has better diagnostic utility than the 2 other variables. An optimum cutoff value (maximal efficiency) of 0.8 was determined for the albumin to globulin ratio (DPR curve analysis). Other studies suggest similar cutoff values. In a study of Shelly et al., 25 a cutoff of 0.8 also was proposed, whereas Duthie et al. 28 determined a cutoff of 0.7. Although the cutoff established by DPR curve analysis gives the optimum discrimination value (on the basis of both specificity and sensitivity), in FIP, high PPV is more important than high NPV because, in most cases, diagnosis of FIP leads to euthanasia. A decrease of the cutoff value for the albumin to globulin ratio could increase the PPV (eg, if the albumin to globulin ratio is \u03fd0.5, the likelihood of FIP is 68, 86, and 96% in populations with a FIP prevalence of 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, respectively) but would decrease the NPV.",

            "text": "Although effusions of clear yellow color and sticky consistency are often called ''typical,'' the presence of fluid in body cavities alone is not diagnostic. Only about half of the cats with effusions suffer from FIP. 36 Even if the fluid seems to be typical, other diseases (eg, heart failure) cannot always be easily excluded. A simple test, the so-called Rivalta's test, has been used to differentiate transudates from exudates. 10 This test, however, is not sensitive to detect exudates in dogs. 37 It is not only the high protein content, but high concentrations of fibrin and inflammatory mediators that induce a positive reaction. Therefore, this test seems to be useful in cats to differentiate between effusion from FIP and effusions caused by other diseases. In this study, Rivalta's test had a PPV of 0.86 and a NPV of 0.97, both very high. There were some false-positive results in cats with bacterial peritonitis. Those effusions, however, are usually easy to differentiate (through macroscopic examination, cytology, and bacterial culture). Some cats with malignant lymphoma also reacted positively in the Rivalta's test, but many of them can also be differentiated cytologically by the presence of malignant lymphocytes. Overall, Rivalta's test is an easy, inexpensive method that does not require special laboratory equipment and can be easily done in private practice. It provides very good predictive values and therefore is a helpful diagnostic parameter. Antibody titers measured in serum are an extensively used diagnostic tool. 4, 38 However, in view of the fact that a large percentage of the healthy cat population is FCoV antibody-positive, that high and rising titers are frequently found in asymptomatic cats, and that most of those cats will never develop FIP, antibody titers must be interpreted extremely critically. 5, 6, 18 From the time the 1st FIP antibody test was described more than 2 decades ago 3 to the present, the inadequacies and pitfalls of the test have been the topic of continuous discussions and controversy. Meanwhile, the so-called FIP test is referred to as ''feline coronavirus antibody test,'' emphasizing that the latter more correctly describes the detection of antibodies that react with a large group of closely related coronaviruses. 31 One purpose of this study was to examine whether anti-FCoV antibodies have any diagnostic value. It is suggested that medium titers do not have any value to diagnose FIP, as was confirmed in this study in which low and medium titers (1 : 25, 1 : 100, 1 : 400) had low predictive value and were therefore not statistically evaluated. However more specifically, the likelihood that a negative titer excludes FIP was investigated. Also, the question was raised whether there is any predictive value if the highest measurable titer is reached (which was 1 : 1,600 in this study). And finally, diagnostic value of antibody detection in fluids other than serum (eg, effusion) was determined.",

If the anti-FCoV antibody test was negative, 90% of the cats did not have FIP. This means, that 10% of the cats without antibodies actually had FIP. In these cats, antibodies were probably bound in antigen antibody complexes and therefore were not detectable. It has been shown, for instance, that in cats with fulminant FIP, titers decrease terminally. 31 Therefore, even negative test results do not exclude FIP. In addition, it is important to mention that the tests that are used in a specific laboratory will affect the results markedly. The antigen used in a test can play an important role in test sensitivity and specificity. In this study, the antigen was derived from TGEV, a pig virus, and this could lower the sensitivity of the test compared to tests in which a feline antigen is used. Thus, it is essential that antibody results interpreted and compared by the clinician are always obtained with the same method performed by the same laboratory, and it is essential to use antibody (and RT-PCR) tests validated by the scientific community.",

Serum RT-PCR was not better (LR 4.4) than antigen antibody complex detection (LR 5.3). There are several plausible explanations for false-negative RT-PCR results. First, serum was used in this study. A higher success rate might have been obtained if plasma had been used instead. A dilution experiment in which plasma and serum samples from the same cat were compared showed that RT-PCR with plasma is more sensitive. 14 Although a direct comparison of RT-PCR in serum or plasma versus whole-blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells has not been published, it could be argued that this would have given even better results. Second, the assay requires reverse transcription of viral RNA to DNA before amplification of DNA, and degradation of RNA could be a potential problem because RNases are virtually ubiquitous. Third, there may be sufficient strain and nucleotide sequence variation such that the target sequence chosen for this assay might not detect all strains of FCoV. However, the PCR assay used was targeted to the 3\u0408-UTR of the viral genome. Because the nucleotide sequence of this region is highly conserved among various FCoV isolates, 42-44 the RT-PCR should detect most FCoV strains circulating in the cat population. There is also a number of explanations for false-positive serum RT-PCR results. First, the assay does not distinguish between ''virulent'' and ''avirulent'' FCoV strains, nor will it discriminate FCoV from canine coronavirus (CCV) and TGEV. Although the role of these viruses in the field is unknown, cats can be experimentally infected with CCV and TGEV [45] [46] [47] ; these infections could result in a positive PCR result. Second, recent studies support the hypothesis that viremia not only occurs in cats with FIP but also in healthy carriers. FCoV RNA could be detected in the blood of cats with FIP but also in healthy cats that did not develop FIP for a period of up to 70 months. 14,48-50 In a study of Gunn-Moore et al., 30 it was shown that in households in which FCoV is endemic, up to 80% of the cats can be viremic, irrespective of their health status, and that the presence of viremia does not appear to predispose the cats to the development of FIP. Therefore, the results of serum RT-PCR tests must be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical findings and cannot be used as the sole criteria for determining FIP. It also has to be considered that although the cats of the control groups in the present study did not show signs of FIP at postmortem examination, there is no reliable means to prove that they did not have early subclinical infection with a mutated FCoV. It is possible that the cats were infected before clinical evidence of FIP and that the stress of another chronic illness allowed sufficient viral replication to be detected in the assay.",

This is considerably less than the PPV of the highest (1 : 1,600) antibody titer (PPV 0.94); this titer, however, was only present in 36 cats.",

            "text": "In effusion, all 3 tests compared in this study provide useful tools to diagnose FIP. If immunofluorescent staining of intracellular FCoV antigen is positive, it is diagnostic for FIP. The Rivalta's test is simple and inexpensive and should be performed in any case of effusion in cats. Anti-FCoV antibody test in effusion also had high PPV and NPV and can be recommended. In addition, RT-PCR in effusion showed promising preliminary results. Therefore, if a clinician suspects FIP, the 1st diagnostic step should always be to look for effusion radiographically and sonographically before submitting expensive blood tests. Diagnostic tests that can be performed in effusion have higher predictive values than tests that can be performed in blood. Unfortunately, if no effusion is present, diagnostic options are lim-ited. Serum RT-PCR cannot be considered a useful tool to diagnose FIP because it is very sensitive and detects lowgrade viremia in cats that don't have FIP and will never develop FIP. Antigen antibody complex detection is a very interesting approach, but unfortunately not specific and sensitive enough in a clinical setting. Anti-FCoV antibodies should be tested in a cat with signs of FIP but should be interpreted very critically because negative titers don't exclude FIP. Only quantitative titer assays should be used and only the highest titer has useful predictive values. All the tests (serum RT-PCR, antigen antibody complexes, anti-FCoV antibodies) should never be the sole criteria for diagnosing FIP and the decision of euthanasia, but they can help facilitate the decision for more invasive diagnostic methods like exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy and histology of organ biopsies that might lead to the final diagnosis.",

The only way to definitively diagnose FIP is histopathology or the detection of intracellular FCoV antigen by immunofluorescent or immunohistochemistry staining. It was shown in this study that a positive staining of macrophages in effusion predicts FIP 100%. The same seems to be true for immunohistochemical staining of tissue macrophages, 52 although not evaluated in a high number of clinical cases. This tool should be used whenever possible. If no effusion is present, the statement that Barlough 54 established more than 15 years ago that ''organ biopsy is the only test procedure that can be used to definitely diagnose FIP in the living animals'' is still true despite the many new tests and molecular biology methods that are available.
