Moreover, 31.56 % of patients received Ribavirin, 59.11 % of patients received Abidol, and 61.33 % of patients received Oseltamivir. Methylprednisolone was administered in 44.44 % of cases, and anti-inflammatory drugs and supportive care were used for some patients. One or two weeks later, patients' respiratory symptoms began to improve, the infiltrates in the lung began to absorb gradually, and the counts of white blood cells (WBCs) and lymphocytes returned to normal values. Twenty of non-severe COVID-19 patients recovered and were discharged. As of February 29, 2020, there were only two cases of death (0.89 %) with an underlying disease or bacterial co-infection.",

Fever, cough, multiple patchy glassy shadows on CT images of the peripheral and posterior lungs, and normal or decreased white blood cells are the common clinical feature of COVID-19, while some of patients showed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or death. Early epidemic investigation showed that the Wuhan Huanan seafood market may be the first identified source of infection7, but solid data have shown the possibility of a person-to-person spread [10,11]. None of the patients included in the current study had any direct or indirect connection with the Huanan seafood market. It has been known that the SARS coronavirus utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the cell [12]. ACE2 receptor is a relatively new member of the renin-angiotensin system, and the maintenance of normal ACE2 levels in the lung promotes resistance against inflammatory lung disease [13]. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus and the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 viruses enter and damage the cells is still unclear. The studies of Huang et al. [14] and Zhang et al. [15] have found that, respectively, 6 of 41(15 %) and 42 of 140 (30 %) COVID-19 patients have hypertension. In the present investigation, the incidence of hypertension was 45.95 % (17of 37patients) in the severe COVID-19 group compared to 15.96 % (30 of 188 patients) in the non-severe group. This finding is consistent with the notion that hypertension is a high risk for COVID-19 patients. However, the mechanism underlying this link is unknown. The possibility can be raised that high blood pressure may damage ACE2 receptor-expressing endothelial or alveolar epithelial cells in the lung.",
