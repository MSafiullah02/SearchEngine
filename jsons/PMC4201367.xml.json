            "text": "Although it is attractive to speculate that failure of normal endogenous airway stem cell reparative function may contribute to chronic acquired lung diseases such as emphysema, evidence for this remains sketchy at present. More suggestive information is available for the genetic lung disease, cystic fibrosis (CF). Airway epithelium in CF patients contains primitive cuboidal cells that express primitive cell markers, including thyroid transcription factor and cytokeratin 7.44 Neuroepithelial cells also express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), the defective protein in patients with CF that seems to play a role in neuropeptide secretion.45, 46 CFTR \u2013/\u2013 mice also contain fewer pulmonary neuroendocrine cells during embryonic development but increased numbers of these cells postnatally.47 This suggests that endogenous airway progenitor cell pathways in CF lungs may be altered, but this has not been extensively investigated. Recently, another population of putative airway progenitor cells expressing CCSP, SCA-1, stage-specific embryonic antigen 1, and the embryonic stem cell marker Oct-4 have been identified in neonatal mice.48, 49 These cells were able to form epithelial colonies and differentiate into both type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. Interestingly, these cells were susceptible to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus raising the possibility that endogenous lung progenitor cells may be specific disease targets. Comparably, the basal epithelial cells of the trachea and upper airways seem more susceptible to infection with the common cold rhinovirus.50 Endogenous progenitor cells may also be attractive candidates for targeting with gene transfer vectors that provide sustained expression. Variant Clara cells seem to be specifically targeted by recombinant adeno-associated vectors in adult mice.51 The possibility remains that other endogenous stem or progenitor populations exist, and there is much room for additional information on regulatory mechanisms and pathways as have been elucidated in other epithelial progenitor cell populations.52\n",

Cancer stem cells have been defined in transplantation assays as the critical cells from tumors that are capable of propagating disease and are hypothesized to be the cells that maintain tumor progression and disease resistance.53, 54 Best described in breast and other solid cancer, increasing evidence suggests there may be multiple lung cancer stem cells.55, 56, 57 Given the heterogeneity of lung cancers, this may not be surprising. BASCs have been suggested to have a role in development of lung cancer in mice, but their role in tumor maintenance has not been established, nor has the human correlation been demonstrated. Side population CD45-Hoechst-effluxing cells have been identified in several human lung cancer cell lines and exhibit tumorigenic properties when subcutaneously implanted into NOD SCID mice.58 Side population cells have also been identified in clinical lung cancer specimens.58 Several recent reports implicate CD133+ cells as both conferring resistance to chemotherapy and having tumor initiating properties for lung cancers.59, 60, 61, 62 Recent studies have begun elucidating cell signaling and gene expression pathways including Wnt, hedgehog, c-kit, Akt, and others that may play roles in transformation of endogenous progenitor cells into lung cancer cells.60, 61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68 Despite growing data, additional work is needed to clarify the connections between endogenous lung progenitor cells and their potential roles as lung cancer stem cells and to determine their potential role as therapeutic targets.",

            "text": "Progress using ESCs for lung regeneration or repair has been slower to develop. In studies during the past approximate 5 years, several laboratories have demonstrated that both mouse and human ESCs can be induced in culture to acquire phenotypic markers of type 2 AEC, including expression of surfactant proteins and lamellar bodies, and even form pseudoglandular structures.69, 70, 71, 72 In general, this occurred at a low level unless the ESCs were genetically engineered to select for surfactant protein-expressing cells.73 More recent protocols and manipulation of cell signaling pathways guiding embryologic lung development and development of definitive endoderm have yielded more robust in vitro derivation of cells with phenotypic characteristics of type 2 alveolar epithelial cells from murine ESCs (Fig 3\n).74 Derivation of airway epithelial cells from ESCs has proven even more elusive although development of cells with phenotypic markers of airway epithelial cells has been demonstrated after culture of the ESCs under air\u2013liquid interface conditions.75, 76 Moreover, there are still only limited available studies of effects of ESC administration to lung in vivo. Endotracheal administration of mESC-derived type 2 AEC to fetal mice resulted in survival of the cells in the lungs and maintenance of pro-SPC expression during a 24-hour period.74 Whether the cells truly engrafted or had functional significance was not determined. Most recently, transduction of one of the approved human ESC lines developed at the University of Wisconsin (line H9.2) with an SPC-promoter-driven neomycin expression cassette was used to develop a >99% pure population of ESC-derived cells with phenotypic characteristics of type 2 AEC, including surfactant expression and presence of lamellar bodies (hES-ATII).77 Intratracheal administration of the hES-ATII cells 1 or 2 days after induction of acute lung injury following intratracheal bleomycin administration to immunocompromised SCID mice resulted in a substantial number of hES-ATII cells seeming to have engrafted in lung with persistent SPC expression up to 9 days later. Up to 20% of the total SPC-expressing cells seemed to be of hES-ATII origin. A small number of hES-ATII cells also seemed to have differentiated into type 1 AEC in vivo. No apparent engraftment was observed if hES-ATII cells were administered to na\u00efve uninjured mice or if a control monocyte population was administered. In parallel, bleomycin-induced lung injury was significantly reduced in mice receiving hES-ATII cells but not monocytes or vehicle control. Reduced injury was measured by both qualitative and quantitative measures, including functional measurements of tidal volumes and arterial oxygen saturations. Whether the observed amelioration of lung injury resulted from structural engraftment of the administered cells or reflected a previously unsuspected paracrine effect of the hES-derived cells is not yet clear. Nonetheless, these results have several ramifications, including the study and potential use of ESCs in genetic lung diseases as human deltaF508 embryonic stem cell lines have been established in England and Belgium.78, 79 These cells exhibit normal morphology and protein expression compared with other hES cell lines but have not been studied in detail. With the new loosening of restrictions on study of human ESCs in the United States, it is anticipated that there will be further rapid advances in study of ESCs for lung injury and repair.",

As such, a sizeable literature has developed over the past approximate 10 years predominantly based on studies in mice using techniques that evaluated histologic demonstration of tagged donor-derived marrow cells in recipient lungs after systemic or more intratracheal administration of tagged donor marrow cells. Experimental approaches have included use of donor marrow cells from transgenic GFP expressing mice or use of sex-mismatched transplantation (ie, male donor cells into female recipients) and subsequent identification of donor cells using fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect the Y chromosome (reviewed in Reference 80). Lethal irradiation and myeloablation of the recipient mouse bone marrow prior to cell administration was frequently but not always used. Notably, prior lung injury, including radiation-induced lung injury resulting from myeloablative total body irradiation, was usually required to observe engraftment although lung injury did not always result in apparent increase of engraftment.81, 82, 83\n",

            "text": "However, it has become apparent that engraftment of exogenously administered adult stem cells as airway and alveolar epithelial cells is generally a rare occurrence of uncertain physiologic significance.84, 85 Several technical issues contributed to misinterpretation of results in the earlier reports including inadequate microscopic techniques in which donor-derived cells superimposed on resident airway or alveolar epithelial cells were not effectively discriminated. Furthermore, a variety of leukocytes, notably airway and alveolar macrophages, reside in the lung. Many of the early reports did not use antibodies directed against CD45 or other leukocyte markers to exclude the possibility that cells of donor origin detected in airway or alveolar epithelium were donor-derived leukocytes rather than epithelial cells. Other tools, such as detection of GFP by direct fluorescence as a marker of donor-derived marrow cells, can be subject to error in the presence of autofluorescent cells resident in the lung, notably alveolar macrophages.86 Furthermore, fusion of marrow-derived cells with resident organ cells, rather than phenotypic conversion of the marrow cells, has been demonstrated in several organs, notably liver and skeletal muscle, but also in lung.87, 88, 89 The extent of fusion in lung after sex-mismatched transplantation may be underestimated as the Y chromosome may be lost from the heterokaryon cells resulting from fusion of donor-derived marrow cells with type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in mouse lungs.89 A smaller body of literature in human bone marrow and lung transplantation that had also demonstrated apparent chimerism in lungs of the transplant recipients has also been called into question for the same reasons (reviewed in Reference 80).90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97\n",

            "text": "Nonetheless, recent studies with more rigorous techniques continue to demonstrate that engraftment of airway and alveolar epithelium, as well as of pulmonary vascular endothelium and of lung interstitium, with adult bone marrow or cord blood-derived stem cells, although rare, can occur under certain conditions, usually after previous perturbation through induction of lung injury.17, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106 Interestingly, several recent reports suggest that chronic or progressive lung injury may result in more substantial engraftment of type 2 AECs and of interstitial and pulmonary vascular cells with donor-derived cells in mouse or rat models.101 However, not all chronic lung injury models resulted in substantial epithelial engraftment.107 Notably, engraftment of pulmonary vascular endothelium and stimulation of no-angiogenesis by exogenously administered EPCs has fostered recent clinical trials for treatment of pulmonary hypertension (as will be discussed further).108, 109, 110 However, there are many variables still left to be explored that may increase epithelial, interstitial, or pulmonary vascular engraftment with circulating or donor-derived cells. For example, the types of marrow-derived, cord-blood-derived, or fully differentiated nonpulmonary cells that might engraft as lung epithelium, interstitium, or pulmonary vasculature remain to be fully explored. In addition to existing studies of HSCs, MSCs (of bone marrow and cord blood origin), EPCs, and fibrocytes, the possibility remains that there may be other cell populations that could be recruited to the lung or localized to the lung after systemic or other routes of administration.111, 112 A population of circulating bone-marrow-derived CD45+/CXCR4+/cytokeratin+ cells has been described to participate in re-epitheliazation of denuded tracheal xenografts.113 Most recently, a population of CCSP-expressing marrow cells has been suggested to engraft as airway epithelium.114 Other sources of stem or progenitor cells, such as umbilical cord blood or adipose tissues, also have not yet been extensively characterized for ability to engraft as lung tissue 115, 116, 117 The effect of age of either donor cells or of recipients is also less well explored, although one report demonstrated that transplantation of whole marrow into 1-day-old mouse pups, using a variety of conditioning regimens, did not increase the number of bone-marrow-derived cells over that observed after total marrow administration to adult mice.105 Furthermore, the route of administration of donor-derived cells is less well characterized as most studies have investigated engraftment after systemic administration of donor cells. Direct intratracheal administration of MSCs may enhance retention of donor-derived cells in the lung and possible epithelial engraftment.8, 114 However, this area is controversial and remains under-explored.",

Comparably, intratracheal administration of neonatal mouse lung fibroblasts resulted in apparent alveolar and interstitial engraftment and engraftment was higher in areas of elastase-induced lung injury.119 Systemically administered skin fibroblasts, transduced ex vivo to express angiopoietin-1, protected against lung injury produced by intratracheal endotoxin administration in rats.120 These results suggest that lung injuries might be amenable to cell therapy approaches using a variety of cell types other than stem or progenitor cells.",

Systemic administration of MSCs 4 hours after lung irradiation resulted in apparent engraftment of cells as epithelial and vascular endothelial cells.124 However, MSCs administered at later time points seemed to engraft as interstitial cells and to participate in the development of fibrosis.124, 125 As with engraftment, several factors including age of donor or recipient, type of cell administered, and route of administration might affect recruitment to lung.",

            "text": "MSCs were first described in 1968 as an adherent, clonogenic, nonphagocytic, and fibroblastic-like population of bone marrow cells.130 Since then they have been isolated from many other tissues including adipose tissues, cord blood, placenta, and amniotic fluid.59 MSCs are multipotent and can differentiate into cells of mesodermal, endodermal, and ectodermal lineages.80 Furthermore, these cells also have the ability to regulate hematopoietic cells and to secrete multiple regulatory molecules such as growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines that can modulate immune responses.131 The mechanisms of MSC actions on inflammatory and immune cells are not well understood but likely involve both secretion of soluble mediators as well as cell\u2013cell contact (Fig 4\n). Although the frequency of MSCs in the adult bone marrow is low (less than 0.1%); once isolated, MSCs can be expanded ex vivo, which makes it possible to manufacturer these cells for potential therapeutic purposes. Furthermore, MSCs can easily be transduced or genetically manipulated to deliver or to secrete selected disease-modifying molecules. Moreover, MSCs also seem to be relatively immunoprivileged because of their low constitutive expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) type 1 and lack of constitutive expression of MHC type 2 and the costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD40.132 This allows administration of allogeneic MSCs without significant host responses. Overall, these properties of MSCs make them an attractive therapeutic tool as a vector for treatment delivery or as immunomodulatory agents. As such, MSCs have now been used in clinical trials for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as graft versus host and Crohn\u2019s diseases as well as in acute myocardial infarction.133 As will be discussed, immunomodulation and amelioration of lung injury has now been demonstrated in a variety of mouse models and suggests the most direct translational route toward clinical trials of cell therapies in lung diseases. As such, a trial of allogeneic MSCs in patients with moderate\u2013severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been started in the United States.",

The LPS administration results in acute lung inflammation that begins several hours peaks between 24 and 48 hours and resolves after that.134 Both systemic and intrapulmonary administration of bone-marrow-derived MSCs have been demonstrated to result in improved mortality, improvement of alveolar fluid clearance, and attenuation of inflammation and lung injury despite minimal, if any, engraftment of MSCs in the lung. Several paracrine mechanisms have been proposed for the MSC effects in this model including release of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10, angiopoetin-1, and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). Moreover, MSCs engineered to further express angiopoietin-1 potentiated the protective effect of MSCs.116 The MSCs themselves may be influenced by the specific inflammatory environment in the injured lung. For example, endotoxin can act on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) expressed by the MSCs resulting in increased production of cyclooxygenase-2 and subsequent increased production of the anti-inflammatory agent prostaglandin E2 by the MSCs.15 Similar anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs have been found in endotoxin-treated isolated perfused human lungs.138 Another interesting study performed by Zhao et al showed that the protection of lung injury prevented endothelial leakage by strengthening of the endothelial adherent junction barrier through activation of RhoGTPase Cdc42.139 Altogether, these studies demonstrate the potent immunomodulatory effect of MSCs in mouse and isolated human lung models of acute lung injury and provide important preclinical data for potential clinical trials of allogeneic MSCs in ALI and ARDS.",

However, studies using cell therapy as preventive modality for development of fibrosis (ie, after irradiation-induced lung injury) are needed. For example, administering marrow-derived cells early after radiation-induced lung injury in mice was protective, whereas administering the cells later resulted in the cells contributing to the radiation-induced damage.124 One potential therapeutic avenue for fibrotic lung diseases is to inhibit the fibrocytes. Alternatively, these cells might be excellent vectors to deliver therapeutic agents directly at the site of fibrosis (ie, fibroblastic foci).",

In particular, a study in Tsk mice that had already developed emphysematous changes at the time of transplantation demonstrated a reversal of these changes such that the lungs resembled those of age-controlled normal mice with nonsignificant engraftment of donor-derived cells in chimeric mice lungs.87 Another study in rats was done to specifically evaluate the role of bone marrow stromal cells in irradiation and papain-induced emphysema.14 In this study, plastic adherent bone marrow cells (bone-marrow-derived stromal cells) were systemically administered immediately after irradiation (7.5 Gy total body irradiation) and intratracheal instillation of 8% papain (0.05 mL/100 g body weight). Lungs were harvested after 28 days and demonstrated a reduction in air-space enlargement, as quantified by mean linear intercept, and apoptotic cells in the bone-marrow-derived stromal cells treated group as compared with the controlled irradiated, papain-treated group.14 Minimal engraftment by donor-derived cells was observed. These data suggest that bone-marrow-derived stromal cells can protect against progression of emphysema. The potential mechanism is likely through paracrine effects resulting in decreased alveolar apoptosis after injury. However, there is much yet to be learned about anti-inflammatory effects of bone-marrow-derived and other stem cell populations in models of COPD.",

The primary goal of the trial is to determine the safety of MSC infusions in patients with lung disease. The secondary goal is initial estimation of the potential efficacy of MSCs for decreasing the chronic inflammation associated with COPD, thus improving both pulmonary function and quality of life. The trial has recruited 62 patients in 6 participating U.S. sites. In the 6-month interim data analysis, no infusional toxicities or significant adverse events were reported. Notably, a significant decrease in the circulating inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, which is commonly increased in COPD patients, was noted in treated patients as was a trend towards improvement in quality of life indicators.165 The trial ends in the fall of 2010, and further results will be forthcoming.",

            "text": "CF is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the CF transmembrane CFTR resulting in abnormal ion transport across the respiratory epithelium leading to CF lung disease. The initial cell therapy approach for CF in mouse models was based on the concept of replacing defective airway epithelial cells with wild-type donor cells containing the correct CFTR gene. However, only rare engraftment (<0.025% of total airway epithelial cells) of airway and alveolar epithelium with adult bone-marrow- or cord-blood-derived stem cells with corresponding CFTR protein expression has been found (Fig 5\n).17, 80, 104, 105 This was despite using naphthalene to denude the airway epithelium and conceivably enhance donor cell engraftment. In one study, intestinal engraftment was also assessed, and despite being rare, functional CFTR activity was detected by potential difference measurements in the rectal mucosa of recipient mice. This observation remains unexplained, as it is difficult to reconcile the rare engrafted cell observed with a physiologic change in potential difference. Transplant of whole marrow into 1-day-old CFTR knockout mice also did not increase the number of donor origin cells engrafted as either respiratory or intestinal epithelium.104 These studies suggest that systemic administration of adult bone-marrow- or cord-blood-derived progenitor cells do not result in significant structural engraftment as CFTR-expressing cells as either airway or intestinal epithelium in mouse models. Although not yet investigated in CF mouse models, several recent studies have also found only low levels of airway epithelial engraftment after direct airway administration of donor marrow-derived cells in mice.8, 103 Overall these observations suggest that, unless significant advances are made in understanding the mechanisms by which cells are recruited to airway epithelium and induced to undergo phenotypic conversion to functional airway epithelial cells, correction of CF lung disease by structural engraftment of adult marrow- or cord-blood-derived stem cells is not likely at present. In contrast, as CF lung disease is characterized by chronic neutrophilic airway inflammation and high expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines,166 a potential therapeutic role of MSCs to abate inflammation in CF lung disease is suggested. However, there is no available information concerning the immunomodulatory effects of MSC in CF lungs. This would seem a promising area for study.",

Systematic or intratracheal MSC administration can attenuate MCT-induced increase in pulmonary artery pressure and improve pulmonary vascular resistance.19, 20 The protective effects of MSCs in this model occurred even when cells were administered systemically 7 days after MCT administration.21 MSCs express several growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factors that promote neovascularization, and this might be one of the mechanisms by which MSCs protect against development of PH. Furthermore, EPCs can be transduced to express pro-angiogenic factors such as endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS) or inhibitors of smooth muscle cell proliferation such as calcitonin gene related peptide, which further improve right ventricle function.21 Several studies in mice and dogs have demonstrated a role for exogenously administered EPCs in vasculogenesis and vascular repair in experimental models of pulmonary hypertension.108, 170, 171, 172 EPCs can also preferentially localize to areas of injured lung after systemic administration and may also have paracrine effects to decrease inflammation.173 As such, two pilot trials of autologous EPC administration for primary pulmonary hypertension conducted at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in both adult and pediatric patients demonstrated an increased 6-minute walk capacity and improved hemodynamic variables, including mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and cardiac output, 12 weeks after systemic administration of autologous EPCs with conventional therapy compared with patients receiving conventional therapy alone.110, 174 Importantly, no adverse effects of EPC administration were noted, although long-term follow-up is pending. A therapeutic trial of administration of autologous EPCs transduced to express eNOS for patients with pulmonary hypertension, the Pulmonary Hypertension and Cell Therapy (PHaCeT) trial has been initiated at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. As of March 2010, the PHACeT trial has completed enrollment of the first 2 dose-panels with 3 patients receiving a total of 7 million early growth EPCs transfected to overexpress human eNOS in panel 1 and three more patients receiving 23 million cells in panel 2 (information courtesy of Duncan Stewart, MD, FRCPC). The cell delivery procedure was well tolerated, and there were no safety concerns. Notably, the first 6 patients showed a remarkable reduction in total pulmonary vascular resistance during the course of the 3-day delivery period, which might represent the effect of increased nitric oxide (NO) release by the engineered EPCs within the pulmonary microcirculation. The trial\u2019s Data Safety Monitoring Board has approved moving to panel 3, which calls for a total of 50 million cells, again in 3 divided doses over 3 days. Completion of the third dose panel will be followed by enrollment of an additional 3 patients at the highest tolerated cell dose, which should provide sufficient support to move forward with the design of a randomized controlled trial that can assess potential efficacy of this cell therapy approach in pulmonary artery hypertension.",

In parallel, increased numbers of circulating EPCs also portended worse survival among those with non\u2013small-cell lung cancer. Thus, circulating stem or progenitor cells may serve as useful biomarkers for lung cancer response to therapies.",

A population of cells described as adult lung somatic progenitor cells isolated from adult sheep lungs cultured in synthetic polymer constructs resulted in expression of airway and alveolar epithelial markers by the cells.196 Structures resembling lung airways and parenchyma developed when impregnated constructs were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice or inserted into the wound cavity after wedge lung resection in sheep. Adipose-derived MSCs, cultured ex vivo in sheets of polyglycolic acid and then applied to wound edges after lung volume reduction surgery in rats, accelerated alveolar and vascular regeneration.197 Successful engineering of a portion of a bronchus and subsequent transplantion into a patient with bronchial stenosis has also been reported.198 In this particular study, autologous bone-marrow-derived MSCs were cultured and differentiated into chrondroblasts prior to seeding onto a de-cellularized allograft section of bronchus along with the patient\u2019s epithelial cells. By applying appropriate growth factors and physical force, a functional bronchus resulted and was used in transplantation.
