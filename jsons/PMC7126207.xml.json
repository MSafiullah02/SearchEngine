Moreover, other than the models about three assessments above, a significant difference is detected in the contribution of symptom patterns for the prostate volume assessment between TCM and WM therapies, as indicated by the Chow test (p\n < 0.01).

In our study, there are no significant differences in QOL and the maximum UFR between both TCM (HST) and WM (THH) treatment groups (Table 1), which indicate that herbal Saxifrage may serve as a potentially efficient medicine for BPH and may contribute to the therapy of BPH.

Moreover, we employed the Chow test for roughly evaluating the two linear regression models about TCM and CM. Analysis showed that there are significant differences in the contributions of non-urethra-related symptoms for the prostate volume assessment between TCM and WM therapies (Table 3), suggesting that the different non-urethra-related symptom patterns might have a certain relation to the assessment of treatment, for example, prostate volumes of BPH. In this sense, symptom patterns could be worthy of further understanding the complex manifestations of BPH. As we have known, the treatments of BPH in TCM are based on the rule of differentiation of ZHENG.9, 10 Therefore, the effects of TCM and WM, which are associated with different symptom patterns, might indicate different strategies for the treatment of patients with BPH.",

BPH causes significant pathologic changes in the urethra of some patients and symptoms in others.26 The symptoms and/or pathologic effects of BPH are the results of its secondary effects on the bladder and kidneys. Finally, the principal symptoms that draw attention to a significant urethra problem from BPH may be due to the secondary phenomena such as chronic or recurrent bacterial urethra infection or to symptoms resulting from impaired kidney function.26 The stimulus to seek an evaluation of voiding dysfunction possibly caused by BPH has traditionally been the presence of lower urethra symptoms. The results indicate that BPH may have the same pathologic change with diverse clinical manifestations and the integrity dysfunction could not be reflected entirely by the objective measurements alone. Thus, we should be well aware of the psychological and the integrative impacts of BPH for the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluations of BPH. The current criteria might be incapable of evaluating the integrative function in BPH patients and the corresponding effects of TCM.",
