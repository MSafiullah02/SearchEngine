            "text": "Although few patients require a prolonged length of stay (PLS) in an intensive care unit (ICU), these patients account for considerable numbers of ICU bed days (Pollack et al. 1987; Namachivayam et al. 2012; Marcin et al. 2001). In pediatric ICU (PICU) settings, PLS is considered a critical issue because the affected children face higher risks of comorbidities and mortality and a poor quality of life while consuming substantial patient care and financial resources (Pollack et al. 1987; Namachivayam et al. 2012; Marcin et al. 2001; Gonzalez-Cortes et al. 2011). Therefore, it is imperative to balance the needs of patients in this population with available resources to optimize the efficiency and quality of critical care. In the literature, the reported prevalence of long-stay patients varies because of differences in the lengths of stay (LOSs), which may differ because of variations in factors such as illness severity, diagnostic diversity, and institutional practices (Straney et al. 2010; Ruttimann et al. 2000; Ruttimann and Pollack 1996). Additionally, these patients tend to receive complicated long-term care in the ICU (Namachivayam et al. 2012).",

However, the rates of PICU utilization and resource consumption among long-stay patients have not been characterized recently, and research is needed to describe the current statuses and effects of patients with a PLS. Previous studies have reported that predictors of a PLS include younger age, chronic illness, and emergent admission (Pollack et al. 1987; Straney et al. 2010; Marcin et al. 2001; Ruttimann and Pollack 1996). Nevertheless, many factors remain controversial, including the admission source, admission category (cardiac versus non-cardiac), and severity of the condition (Marcin et al. 2001; Ruttimann and Pollack 1996). Additionally, although previous long-term follow-up studies have reported a poor quality of life and increased mortality among long-stay patients (Pollack, et al. 1987; Namachivayam et al. 2012; Marcin et al. 2001), few have addressed whether long-stay patients face an increased risk of infectious complications during a PICU stay (Gonzalez-Cortes et al. 2011).",

During the study period, discharge from the PICU was discussed during daily morning rounds, and final decisions were made by the attending intensivists. Indications for PICU admission included airway obstruction, acute respiratory failure potentially requiring respiratory support [e.g., humidified high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, and mechanical ventilation (MV)], cardiovascular dysfunction, a deteriorated level of consciousness, and a requirement for heavy nursing care and meticulous monitoring. PICU patients were transferred to wards or other hospitals when relevant indications were addressed. The operation room (OR) was the most common origin of admission.

However, a contemporary multicenter study conducted in the USA reported a PLS prevalence of 2.3%, which is strikingly similar to our finding (Pollack et al. 2018). Therefore, we believe that our findings may provide a reasonable approximation for settings in developed countries. Second, the limited sample size underpowered our risk factor analysis. As we expected limited cases with PLS a priori, we decided to focus on descriptive rather than multivariable analysis. Consequently, we could not draw conclusions regarding the correlations and modifications among the possible risk factors for PLS. Third, the study outcomes may have been influenced by institutional practice and physician\u2019 preferences, given the considerable variability in decisions regarding discharge from the PICU. As with previous studies, we could not identify the criteria determining admission to and discharge from the PICU. Future studies are needed to determine the indications for a PICU stay.",
