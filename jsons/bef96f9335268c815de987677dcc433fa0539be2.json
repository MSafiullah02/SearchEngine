As of April 7, 2020, it has reached 184 countries and territories, infecting more than 1.4 million people worldwide with more than 82,000 deaths. 1 The situation in China has improved significantly since December 31, 2019, when the outbreak in the city of Wuhan was first reported. 2 Owing to the unprecedented and effective quarantine measures taken across the country, Chinese health authorities reported on March 18, 2020 , that for the first time since the outbreak no new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases had been reported, marking a major turning point in the fight against the highly contagious coronavirus. 3 Since then, the daily number of new cases in mainland China has dropped to double digits, with new infections primarily originating from incoming air passengers from outside China. 4 With the easing of the COVID-19 public health emergency in China, many of the stringent measures implemented during the crisis are gradually being relaxed, and the country is cautiously and methodically preparing to begin a post-pandemic return to normality. As part of the effort to restore societal activities suspended due to the virus outbreak, hundreds of thousands of primary, secondary, and high schools across the country, closed in January in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, have begun to reopen and resume their regular academic and physical education curricula, especially in lowrisk regions (i.e., in communities free of the disease).",

Sanitize all surfaces and equipment regularly at the school, including sports facilities and equipment. Restrict physical activities that involve body contact and the sharing of sports equipment, as well as water bottles. Choose drills and exercises that encourage social distancing. Avoid sport activities involving body contact between students or contact with shared equipment (e.g., balls), especially when resuming physical activity programs. Contact the student's parents immediately if a student experiences any abnormal respiratory symptoms. Isolate the student and anyone who may have been exposed to the virus. Plan physical activities that accommodate children with special healthcare needs, 20 including children who have chronic illnesses (such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, or heart disease) or immune or neuromuscular problems. Avoid continuous vigorous activity for these children. Create innovative teaching strategies as needed, including Internet-based, virtual delivery of classes in order to minimize direct student-to-student and student-to-teacher contact.",
