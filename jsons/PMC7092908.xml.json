            "text": "To screen and identify the effective RNAi probes more robustly and cost-effectively, we have developed a reliable and quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system required only a short synthetic DNA fragment. This system is composed of a short synthetic DNA fragment and two expression vectors for targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expression (Fig. 1\n). The short synthetic DNA fragment is formed by annealing two complementary sense- and antisense-oligonucleotides, which contain a unique RNAi targeting sequence with 19-nt in length flanked by five consecutive adenosine and thymidine residues (As and Ts) at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends as an effective termination signal for transcription of the antisense- and sense-RNA, respectively (Fig. 1B). The unique RNAi targeting sequence is selected and designed from protein coding region of the target gene according to the sequence-specific characteristics of the effective siRNAs as described in Introduction. To construct the targeting reporter vector, a short synthetic DNA fragment containing a unique RNAi targeting sequence of interest is fused with a reporter gene at the 5\u2032-, 3\u2032-UTR or is inserted within the reporter gene without interfering in its activity (Fig. 1A). To make the greatest value and utility of this short synthetic DNA fragment, simultaneously, it is also cloned into a specific triggering siRNA expression vector that contains two functional convergent RNA Pol III promoters (Fig. 1C). Efficacy of the siRNAs is measured by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporter gene, which contains the corresponding short synthetic DNA fragment, with easily quantified readouts including EGFP or firefly luciferase. In addition, to make this system complete, it is convenient to include an excellent in vitro cell model, which not only provides an easy cell culture system but also has high transfection efficiency. Because this system is used for screening the highly effective RNAi probes directly against genes with wide range of biological functions, it is better to perform the screening in a non-human and non-mouse cell line. To fit these criteria, the baby hamster kidney fibroblast BHK is chosen as an in vitro experimental model. Moreover, to standardize the experimental procedures, including cell culture conditions and transfection protocols, have been optimized.",

For this purpose, we have particularly constructed four effective shRNA and siRNA expression vectors for inhibiting EGFP (pHsH1-shEGFP and pDual-siEGFP) and firefly luciferase (pHsH1-shLuc and pDual-siLuc) expression that could serve as references for positive controls.

To determine the inhibition effects of pHsH1-expressed shsAg1 (or shsAg3) and pDual-expressed sisAg1 (or sisAg3) on HBsAg expression, human hepatoma cell line Huh7 cells were cotransfected with HBsAg expression vector p(3A)SAg-luc+ or p(3A)SAg-EGFP and shsAg expression vector pHsH1-shsAg1 (or shsAg3) or sisAg expression vector pDual-sisAg1 (or sisAg3). The expression levels of HBsAg, firefly luciferase, and EGFP in total protein extracts were determined at 48 h posttransfection.

BHK cells were cotransfected with targeting reporter expression vector (pEGFP-3UTR-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-2, siAKT1-3, siAKT1-4 or siAKT1-5; pLuc+-3UTR-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-2, siAKT1-3, siAKT1-4 or siAKT1-5) and triggering siRNA expression vector (pDual-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-2, siAKT1-3, siAKT1-4 or siAKT1-5). The expression levels of EGFP, GST, firefly, and Renilla luciferases were determined at 48 h posttransfection. As the results shown in Figs. 6\nA, C, and E, the siAKT1-1, siAKT1-3, and siAKT1-5 only induced low to medium levels of inhibition on expression of the targeting reporter EGFP or firefly luciferase expressed from pEGFP-3UTR-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-3 or siAKT1-5; pLuc+-3UTR-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-3 or siAKT1-5. In contrast with the siAKT1-1, siAKT1-3, and siAKT1-5, the siAKT1-2 and siAKT1-4 triggered strong inhibition effects as compared with two standard positive controls, siEGFP and siLuc, expressed from pDual (Figs. 6B and D). According to the results indicated, the RNAi targeting sequences siAKT1-2 and siAKT1-4 exhibited inhibition effect with efficacy more than 90%. To further confirm these results, HeLa and HEK293 cells were transfected with triggering siRNA expression vector, pDual-siAKT1-1, siAKT1-2, siAKT1-3, siAKT1-4 or siAKT1-5. Consistent with the results obtained from the reporter-based siRNA validation system, the selectively active siAKT1-2 and siAKT1-4 expressed from pDual indeed exhibited high inhibition effects on endogenous AKT1 expression; in contrast, the partially active siAKT1-1, siAKT1-3, and siAKT1-5 had inhibition effects with efficacy of about 60\u201370% (Fig. 6F). These results clearly indicated that this reporter-based siRNA validation system could robustly and efficiently screen highly effective RNAi probes for either reverse functional genomics or gene silencing-based therapeutics.",

It has been shown that fusion of the targeting reporter gene with the different length of RNAi targeting sequence either 19- or 38-nt exhibits no significant difference on inhibition effects induced by the corresponding siRNAs [35]. These results clearly indicate that the 19-nt sequence in an active siRNA is enough to serve as a functional RNAi targeting sequence for achieving the reporter-based siRNA validation assay. As an ideal and workable system, the RNAi targeting sequence is conveniently and efficiently fused at the 3\u2032-UTR of the targeting reporter gene with no regard to its open reading frame and no effect on its translation.

Once the highly effective RNAi probes are identified, one could easily establish the specific gene knockdown in the in vitro cell lines or in vivo animal models that provide a loss-of-function mutation in the novel or putative genes.

Inhibition of virus-specific genes by siRNAs has proven to be a potential therapeutic strategy against virus induced diseases. For instance, inhibition of virus replication and gene expression by directly introducing siRNAs into the cells has been reported for numerous viruses [47], [48], including several important human pathogens such as poliovirus [49], HIV-1 [22], [50], hepatitis C virus [51], influenza virus [52], dengue virus [53], and hepatitis B virus [37], [54], [55]. A number of extremely virulent viruses including Ebola, Lassa, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1), West Nile, and smallpox viruses are highly infectious and cause extraordinarily deadly diseases [56], [57]. Furthermore, there are currently no vaccines or effective therapies available, and in particular these viruses require special containment for safe research. To develop an extremely potent RNAi-based therapeutics for these virulent viruses with safety, this reporter-based siRNA validation system could provide a simple and powerful approach for screening and identification of highly effective siRNAs directly against viral gene expression without the need of direct virus culture. Currently, we have successfully screened and identified several highly effective RNAi probes potentially against these virulent viruses by simply using the rational design strategy and this reporter-based siRNA validation system (C.-F. Teng, unpublished data).",
