Following acute infection spontaneous resolution can occur while infected individuals that fail to clear the virus develop a chronic infection leading to liver disease, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Estimates of spontaneous clearance rates range from 14 to 45% depending on the population studied (3). One of the major risk factors for chronicity is HCV genotype. Currently, seven genotypes and multiple sub-types of HCV have been identified (4). Most patients are infected with only one genotype rather than multiple genotypes and within an individual the virus will mutate to form multiple genetic variants, called a quasispecies (5).",

It has been possible to reconstitute the replication cycle of HCV in human non-hepatic cells such as 293T cells in vitro (6), and even in mice (7). Both of these approaches required the addition of extra host factors; both 293T cells and mice required the HCV entry factors claudin-1 (CLDN1) and CD81, in addition, 293T cells required occludin (OCLN), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and the human micro RNA miR-122, while effective HCV RNA replication in mice also required the knockdown of murine innate immune mediators (7\u20139). Key to the replication in non-human cells seems to be the expression of the human micro RNA miR-122 (9). miR-122 has been shown to bind to the 5\u2019 UTR of HCV and to enhance translation and replication of HCV RNA (10\u201314), thus, enhancing HCV propagation (15).",

Historically, HCV was first propagated in permissive human hepatoma cell lines derived from Huh-7. Initially, only low-level replication was possible, but selection using interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) allowed for the isolation of cell lines that were highly permissive for replication, producing high-viral titers, including Huh-7.5 (16, 17). Key to the progression of HCV research was the development of HCV replicon systems (18). These consist of a minimal HCV genome (NS3 to NS5B non-structural genes flanked by the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs) combined with a selection marker and/or reporter gene that is incapable of producing infectious virus but is capable of RNA replication in vitro. Another great leap occurred in 2005 when a number of groups (19\u201321) advanced the replicon system to show that HCV could undertake a full cycle in cell culture to produce infectious virus. This followed the identification of an HCV isolate that was replication competent without requiring tissue culture-adapting mutations (22).",

There are multiple type I IFNs, including multiple sub-types of IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, -\u03b5, -\u03ba, and -\u03c9, and all signal through the IFNAR complex (36). In contrast, Type II IFN comprises only one molecule, IFN-\u03b3, which signals through the IFN-\u03b3R complex (37). Receptor binding stimulates a cascade of signal transduction events, discussed in detail below, and triggers an expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that mediate a host of antiviral effects [reviewed by Schoggins and Rice (38)].",

            "text": "Signal transduction in response to Type III IFNs is similar to that seen with Type I IFN [reviewed by Au-Yeung et al. (52)], and is summarized in Figure 2. When Type III interferon binds to IFN-\u03bbR1, a conformational change allows the binding of IL-10R2 activating the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) to cross-tyrosine-phosphorylate the IFN-\u03bbR1/IL-10R2 receptor complex allowing the recruitment of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 2 via its Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain. Further JAK tyrosine-phosphorylation of STAT2 allows the binding of the SH2 domain from cytoplasmic STAT1, resulting in the formation of a STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer. STAT2 is normally bound to IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) in the cytosol, where it shuttles between the nucleus and cytosol. The addition of IRF9 to the complex forms a heterotrimeric transcription complex called IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). IFN-\u03bb may also activate STATs 3\u20135, although the significance of this activation has not been studied (53). Once assembled, ISGF3 relocates from the cytosol to the nucleus where it binds to interferon stimulated response elements (ISREs) upstream of ISGs [reviewed by Reich (54)], encoding proteins such as myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (MX1), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), and 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS). The IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb induction of these ISGs is reduced in STAT1 deficient hepatocytes, consistent with the requirement of STAT1 for formation of the ISGF3 complex (50). In HepG2 cells, induction of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 is not seen when cells are stimulated with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb but these same cytokines do induce IFN-\u03bb (55). Therefore, in contrast to the Type I IFNs, Type III IFNs are themselves ISGs.",

            "text": "Although most of the above-mentioned studies show similar gene expression repertoires after stimulation with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb, the kinetics, and magnitude of induction are different. In a study comparing global transcriptional profiles over time, Bolen et al. identified a difference in the scale of ISG induction between different cytokines in both Huh-7 cells and primary hepatocytes (62) with IFN-\u03b2 > IFN-\u03b1 > IFN-\u03bb3 > IFN-\u03bb1 > IFN-\u03bb2. In this experiment, the same set of genes were induced with all the cytokines but whereas IFN-\u03b1 stimulated gene expression wanes after approximately 6 h, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1\u20133 stimulated gene expression continues at a high level for >24 h. The greater specific activity (ISG induction) of IFN-\u03bb3 over other Type III IFNs as shown by Bolen et al. has also been replicated by Dellgren et al. (63) who showed that IFN-\u03bb3 is 16-fold more active than IFN-\u03bb2 and 2-fold more active than IFN-\u03bb1. A recent comparison between IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN-\u03bb4 has shown comparable specific activity (44). One possible explanation for the differences in the scale of ISG induction between IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb may be due to transcription factor binding differences. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that less efficient remodeling at promoter sites occurs following stimulation by IFN-\u03bb compared to IFN-\u03b1 (48). Blocking signaling through the Type I receptor, IFNAR, does not abrogate the activity of IFN-\u03bb (50). IFN-\u03bb signaling was shown to be enhanced by HCV infection of Huh-7.5 cells, an observation, which has been attributed to up-regulation of IFN-\u03bbR1 and prolongation of JAK-STAT signaling within those cells (60).",

Although expression of both IFN Type I and III are triggered in similar ways, differential expression can clearly be seen in organs such as the brain and central nervous system where IFN Type III expression is minimal compared to Type I IFN expression, following viral infection (47). Dendritic cells (DCs) can express IFN-\u03bb on stimulation with double-stranded RNA and TLR3 ligand (66).",

Until recently, it was not possible to distinguish a particular cytokine expressing cell within a population. However, in an elegant set of experiments carried out by Sheahan et al. (31), the expression profiles of individual fetal hepatocytes were determined following laser capture micro-dissection. Type III interferon induction was observed only in HCV-infected FHH cells and not by surrounding bystander cells. Furthermore IFNL1 expression was found to be dependant on HCV replication as blocking viral replication using 2\u2032CMA (a viral replicase inhibitor) abrogated IFN-\u03bb1 protein secretion (31).",

IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 are the most similar, with approximately 96% amino-acid identity (seven amino-acid differences) within their coding sequences and virtually identical within their non-coding upstream and downstream flanking sequences (41). Despite this similarity between IFN-\u03bb2 and -3, it is remarkable that there is a 16-fold difference in specific activity (63).

This uncertainty may be due to the wide range of cell lines used, induction protocols, and the species of IFN-\u03bb used. Knockdown of the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB decreased IFNL1 transcription in response to HCV and PolyI:C, whereas NF-\u03baB was dispensable for the expression of IFNL2 and IFNL3 (72). Lee et al. suggested that this differential requirement for NF-\u03baB could be the basis of the differential expression of the IFN-\u03bb gene family.

IFN-\u03bb can then act in an autocrine fashion, stimulating the expression of ISGs (30, 82). Exogenous addition of IFN-\u03bb to hepatocytes inhibits replication of both HCV replicons (49, 58, 59, 84, 85) and cell culture-derived HCV (30, 31, 60, 70, 72, 82). In HCV replicon cell lines, recombinant IFNL1 had a greater effect on HCV replication than IFNL2 and IFNL3 (85). IFNL1 also induces STAT1 phosphorylation more readily than IFNL2/3 (49, 85), while no differences are seen between IFNL3 and IFNL4 (44). This is not the case when comparing IFN-\u03bb activity against EMCV in HepG2 cells. Dellgren et al. (63) showed that against EMCV, IFNL3 was the most active of IFNL1\u20133. Concomitant with a reduction in HCV replication, IFN-\u03bb also suppresses the microRNA miR-122 (72). The addition of both IFN-\u03bb and the miR-122 inhibitor (miRIDIAN) increased the suppression of HCV replication (72).",

Unfortunately, these regimens were poorly tolerated and often ineffective, with treatment efficacy varying among different HCV genotypes and among patients of different ethnic backgrounds or different comorbid conditions (86). Treatment with Peg-IFN and RBV results in sustained virologic response (SVR) in approximately 40\u201350% of genotype 1-infected people and 80% in those infected with genotypes 2 or 3 (2). HCV treatment is evolving rapidly, and current regimens for genotype 1-infected patients include either telaprevir or boceprevir, first-generation direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). These protease inhibitors (PIs) need to be administered in combination with Peg-IFN and RBV in order to reduce the likelihood of viral drug resistance. The addition of PIs leads to an increase in the likelihood of SVR to between 63 and 92% (2).",

As reports from in vitro studies suggested that HCV was sensitive to IFN-\u03bb, there was hope that IFN-\u03bbs could be used therapeutically to combat HCV. Those hopes have largely been realized following Phase 1 trials looking at the use of pegylated IFN-\u03bb in the treatment of genotype 1 chronic HCV infection (87, 88). The Muir et al. study compared treatment regimens consisting of Peg-IFN-\u03bb or Peg-IFN-\u03bb + RBV in IFN-\u03b1 treatment-relapsed patients (patients who had relapsed following at least 12 weeks treatment with Peg-IFN-\u03b1 + RBV) and Peg-IFN-\u03bb + RBV in treatment-na\u00efve patients. Although SVR was not evaluated in this study (being only 4 weeks long), the majority of patients displayed antiviral activity with a >2-log10 decrease in HCV RNA; in the case of treatment-na\u00efve patients, 2 out of 7 achieved transient undetectable HCV RNA. Encouragingly, the administration of Peg-IFN-\u03bb was well tolerated in both of the phase 1 trials with few adverse events. A possible reason for this effect with Peg-IFN-\u03bb is that unlike IFN-\u03b1, which can produce a long-lasting refractoriness in JAK-STAT signaling (89), the use of Peg-IFN-\u03bb induces signaling even following multiple or prolonged stimulations (90) and may also be able to overcome pre-existing refractoriness due to previous treatment with IFN-\u03b1.",

In a similar manner, individuals with two copies of the beneficial rs8099917-T (T/T) allele respond better than those individuals with one or no copies of the non-beneficial T allele (T/G or G/G) (94). As the rs12979860 and rs8099917 SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other, favorable rs8099917 alleles are also more prevalent in Europeans/Asians compared to Africans. Although Melis et al. did not look at patient data they have developed a method to analyze both rs12979860 and rs8099917 (101), which may provide greater predictability in treatment outcomes.",

            "text": "Recently, two groups identified a possible causal SNP upstream of the IFNL3 gene, rs368234815 (TT or \u0394G) (originally designated ss469415590) (41, 46, 99). This SNP results in a frameshift mutation leading to the polyI:C mediated transient expression of a new IFN-\u03bb, now termed IFNL4 (41). The IFNL4 protein is made in IFNL4-\u0394G carriers but not IFNL4-TT homozygotes. In addition, due to its location within a CpG island upstream of IFNL3, the TT/\u0394G polymorphism is responsible for the methylation of a cytosine residue, which may influence gene expression (99). IFNL4-\u0394G is strongly associated with impaired spontaneous clearance. In African-Americans, the IFNL4-\u0394G SNP has been shown to be a better marker for predicting response following Peg-IFN and RBV than rs12979860 (41, 102). This is in contrast to European- and Asian-Americans where the two SNPs are equally informative (41). This discrepancy is due to the differences in the degree of LD between these SNPs within these populations (99). Recently, another possible causal SNP was detected, rs8103142 (98). This polymorphism is present within the second exon of IFNL3 and changes the amino-acid lysine at position 70 to arginine (K70R). Interestingly, this amino-acid is one of only seven that are different between IFNL2 and IFNL3 (73). Given that IFNL3 has a 16-fold greater specific activity than IFNL2, a number of groups have studied the functional consequences of this substitution in vitro (85, 103, 104); however, they were unable to show any difference in anti-HCV replicon activity or in the stimulation of its activity.",

            "text": "The molecular mechanism for the association between treatment outcome and IFN-\u03bb SNPs is not known. The positions of these SNPs, in the vicinity of IFNL3 and IFNL4, suggest that they may be involved in transcriptional regulation although the evidence for this is conflicting. Ge et al. (91) were unable to detect a relationship between IFNL3 mRNA levels and rs12979860 polymorphism in PBMCs from non-HCV-infected patients; Urban et al. showed that there was no significant difference in IFNL2/3 mRNA expression in HCV-infected liver tissue (103). In contrast, the presence of the non-beneficial G allele for SNP rs8099917 was associated with lower levels of IFN-\u03bb expression in PBMC taken from HCV-infected patients (95) and also whole blood from healthy individuals (94), but there was no significant difference in IFNL3 mRNA expression between rs8099917 genotypes in a study carried out by Honda et al. (105). Conversely, carriers of the protective rs12979860 C allele were shown to have higher serum protein levels of IFN-\u03bb (70), although this may be due to LD with the IFNL4 associated SNP, rs368234815. In a publication by Bibert et al., PBMCs from individuals carrying different allelic combinations of rs12979860 and rs368234815 were stimulated with polyI:C and the expression of IFNL3 mRNA was measured. Their study showed lower expression of IFNL3 mRNA in PBMCs from individuals carrying one or two copies of the mutant \u0394G allele but not by rs12979860 (99). This study also showed that the plasma level of the ISG, IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), was reduced in individuals carrying the rs368234815 non-beneficial allele but not in those carrying the rs12979860 non-beneficial allele. Another mechanism may be the alteration of IFNL3 transcript stability via the action of HCV induced miRNA targeting of the polymorphic region of the IFNL3 3\u2032 UTR (106).",

            "text": "As previously mentioned, miR-122 may play an important role in HCV replication (10). No correlation between expression of miR-122 and SNP rs12979860 genotype was seen in human liver biopsies by Urban et al. (103) although a correlation was seen between SVR and miR-122 expression with greater expression of miR-122 in responders compared to non-responders (NR) (103, 107). In contrast, Estrabaud et al. showed that there was a significant increase of miR-122 at baseline in rs12979860 CC genotype patients regardless of their response status (108). The authors argue that the larger numbers of patients in their study may explain this discrepancy (108). As miR-122 stimulates HCV replication in vitro, and antagonism of miR-122 by the oligonucleotide SPC3649 results in a decrease in serum HCV RNA in vivo (109), the finding that a beneficial allele may increase miR-122 is surprising. In the case of rs12979860, genotype C/C patients have a lower baseline ISG expression (103, 105, 110), and hence a stronger ISG activation upon infection. This innate activation may swamp any effect on HCV replication brought about by an increase in miR-122 (108).",

            "text": "In the case of IFNL4, the frameshift produced by the unfavorable, non-protective \u0394G allele causes the production of IFN-\u03bb4 protein. This protein was postulated to have a weak signal peptide (SP) and subsequent poor secretion (41) but subsequent experiments have shown that the SP functions correctly and that poor secretion is due to the lack of N-linked glycosylation (44). IFN-\u03bb4 is active without glycosylation as Escherichia coli expressed protein is able to induce ISGs in HepG2 cells to a similar level as IFN-\u03bb3, and addition of recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 to Huh-7-Lunet and HepG2 cells inhibited HCV replicon replication (44). The presence of an IFN-\u03bb4 protein that is able to induce ISG expression, is active against HCV, yet is associated with poorer HCV clearance rates is counter-intuitive. Various theories have been put forward for this effect including intracellular accumulation of non-glycosylated IFN-\u03bb4 could be cytotoxic and result in cell death, or that IFN-\u03bb4 could impede signaling by other IFN-\u03bbs by blocking the IFN-\u03bb receptor and causing exhaustion of the IFN response pathways (46). IFNL4 transcripts were exclusively detected in chronic HCV liver biopsies and not in control uninfected, HBV infected, and inflammatory liver diseased liver biopsies (111), suggesting that the IFNL4 gene is specifically activated in HCV infection. In addition, Amanzada et al. were able to show a positive correlation between HCV viral loads and the amount of IFNL4 transcripts. As expected, IFNL4 transcripts were detected in all IFNL4 SNP rs368234815 genotypes but IFN-\u03bb4 protein can only be produced in those patients with the \u0394G genotype.",

This geographical selective force probably occurred after the colonization of the New World (92). Candidates such as hepatitis B and HIV have been discounted as they do not show any association with the known IFN-\u03bb SNPs (112\u2013114).

Though some authors have demonstrated both IFN-\u03bbR1 mRNA and cell-surface expression in T-cells, others have not been able to replicate these findings (117).
