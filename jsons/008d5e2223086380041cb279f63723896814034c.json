            "text": "During the early phase of infection with an extremely neurovirulent murine coronavirus, cl-2, the ER-TR7 antigen (ERag)-positive fibers (ERfibs) associated with laminin and collagen III show a rapid increase in expression levels in the meninges, followed by an appearance of the antigens in the ventricle and brain parenchyma. Then, cl-2 invades the ventricle and ventricular wall along the newly assembled ERfibs after infection, using them as a pathway from the meninges, the initial site of infection. In the lymph nodes and spleen, ERag is mainly produced by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), which play a key role in nursing the ERfibs to form a fibroblastic reticular network (FRN). The FRN functions as a conduit system to transfer antigens, cytokines or leukocytes in the lymphoid organs. In the brain parenchyma, astrocytes were found to produce the main components of mature ERfibs, such as collagen, laminin and ERag, which have been identified in the lymphoid organs. The producibility of these extracellular matrices (ECMs) by astrocytes was further confirmed by primary brain cultures, which disclosed the dissociation of laminin and ERag production, and the close association of ERag production with that of collagen, forming a fibrous structure. The pattern of ECM production in vitro indicated the process of forming mature ERfibs in the brain, that is, fibers made of collagen fibers and ERag are wrapped by laminin prepared as a sheet structure. In addition, the brain parenchymal cells that produce interferon \u03b2 after infection in spite of their residence away from the sites of viral invasion were surrounded by ERfibs, which were closely associated with astrocytic fibers. These findings indicate that astrocytes play a central role in forming the astrocytic reticular network (ARN) in the brain parenchyma, as FRCs do to form FRN in the lymphoid organs.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION cl-2 virus (cl-2) is an extremely neurovirulent murine coronavirus, replicating rapidly in the brain after infection. 1 Infected mice fall into a morbid state within 48 h postinoculation (hpi), and die within 72 hpi with many infected neurons in the brainstem and cortex. The less virulent viruses srr7 virus (srr7) 1 and Mu-3 virus (Mu-3) 2,3 have been isolated from cl-2 and srr7, respectively. Most mice infected with srr7 survive for 8 days after infection. The viral antigens are predominantly detected in the white matter, and neurons are not infected. 1, 4, 5 The virulence of Mu-3 is intermediate between that of cl-2 and srr7, showing a mixed pattern of the neuropathologies of cl-2 and srr7. 6 The viral antigens are detected in both the white matter and neurons. 3 Typical neuropathological change observed in the mice infected with Mu-3, and not with cl-2 or srr7, was apoptosis-induced in the CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus at 4 days post-inoculation (dpi). In spite of these differences in virulence and neuropathological findings, the viruses exhibit a similar pattern of viral spread during the initial phase of infection. Between 12 and 24 hpi, viral antigens are detected only in the meninges, followed by viral spread into the ventricular wall at 24 to 48 hpi before invasion into the brain parenchyma, indicating that the viruses use a passage between the meninges and ventricular wall as an entry route into the brain parenchyma. [3] [4] [5] At 48 hpi, the passage was found to be constructed by the extracellular matrix (ECM) between the ventricle and meninges at the cerebellopontine angle. 7 The ECM includes an antigen recognized by Erasmus University Rotterdam-thymic reticulum antibody 7 (ER-TR7). 8 ER-TR7-antigen (ERag)-positive fibers (ERfibs) associated with laminin and collagen III function as a conduit system for viral entry into the brain parenchyma from the meninges. 7 Studying the initial phase of infection in our previous report, 7 the formation of ECMs other than ERag were detected in the ventricular and paraventricular zone, and around the blood vessels, but it was not prominent in the brain parenchyma in vivo. Therefore, in this report, we studied ECM formation in the brain during the later phase of infection at 72 hpi.",

The ERfibs in the lymphoid organs have collagen fibers as a core, which is wrapped in an ERag-rich matrix, and further by the laminin-rich basement membrane at the outermost surface. 11, 14 These components in lymph nodes are produced by the stromal cells, which include FRCs, lymphatic endothelial cells, blood endothelial cells and contractile pericytes. 13 In the brain, especially in the brain parenchyma, we propose that astrocytes play a central role, like FRCs in the lymphoid organs, in ERag-positive reticular formation after infection, because we found that astrocytes produce the main components of ERfibs, such as ERag, laminin and collagen, in response to viral invasion.",

This effect may be due to physical stress during cell preparation for culture, because physical treatment causes an increase in ERag in vivo. 18 However, the fibrous extracellular structure of ERag was not as clear in the uninfected culture as in the JHMV cl2-infected culture ( Fig. 1B -F) and a deposition of bulky ERag + fibers was found to surround the infected areas (Fig. 1B) . Thus, the expression levels of ERag were increased in the infected culture when analyzed by the average fluorescence intensity (AFI) (Fig. 2 ). Immature forms of ERfibs, detected in vivo 7 as solitary ERag expression without an association with other components of ECM such as laminin and collagen, were also observed in the brain mix culture. Especially, the co-localization of ERfibs and laminin + fibers occurred infrequently (Fig. 1C) . Also, a large population of laminin-producing cells was found to surround a small cluster of ERag-producing cells, whereas there were only a few laminin-producing cells in the areas with a large cluster of ERag-producing cells (Fig. 1D ). In addition, laminin was found to be extracellularly secreted to form a sheetlike structure, which was observed when an image was taken in different focal planes (Fig. 1E4 ).

At 24 and 48 hours post-infection (hpi) (V (24 hpi) and V (48 hpi), respectively), culture slides were processed to detect ER-TR7 antigen (ERag) (Er), mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM virus (JHMV) (V), laminin (La), and collagen III (Col). Hoechst 33 342 (H) was used for nuclear counter-staining. E: A Z-stack study with a 0.5-\u03bcm step size, as illustrated in E4, revealed La-positive (La + ) lace curtain-like structures in E3 at the 12th step (z12), which is located 4 \u03bcm above z8 (E1). At a higher resolution in E than that in C and D, only a minor population of La + fibers was found to co-localize with ERag-positive fibers (ERfibs), in contrast to the high numbers of Col + fibers co-localized with ERag (F). G: A cluster of cells producing both ERag and Col is shown, which also contrasts with an image of La production (D). Long arrows indicate a fiber with co-localization of ERag and laminin. Short arrows in E3 indicate holes in the laminin sheet. The arrowhead indicates the nucleus. Single and double bars indicate 50 and 20 \u03bcm, respectively. expression is not prominent except for as a partial colocalization with the bold ERfib indicated by long arrows. At a position 2 \u03bcm above the image shown in Figure 1E1 , ERag \u00c0 laminin + sheets (Fig. 1E3) , with small-diameter holes (short arrows) compared with the size of the nucleus (Fig. 1E2 ), appeared to cover underlying ERfibs. The ERag \u00c0 laminin + sheets showed a lace curtain structure hanging from the mature ERag + laminin + ERfibs (arrows in Fig. 1E1-3 ). In contrast, collagen fibers were associated with ERfibs more closely (Fig. 1F ) than laminin. Furthermore, an area of clustered cells that produced both collagen and ERag was observed (Fig. 1G ).",

ERag appeared in the brain parenchymal area close to the meninx or ventricle (Fig. 3B) , and was found at a distance from the viral antigens (arrows in Fig. 3B1, B2) , as we previously reported. 7 However, laminin expression was observed in wider areas compared with ERag expression, with fine fibrous structures in the brain parenchyma (Fig. 3C1-3) . The colocalization of laminin and GFAP was observed in the areas near the meninges and ventricle (Fig. 3C3-5) , where structures of blood vessels were accompanied by laminin expression (Fig. C3) . Some of them were wrapped by laminin-positive (La + ) astrocytic fibers (Fig. 3C3, C4 ), but many were free of La + foot process of astrocytes at a low magnification (Fig. 3C3) . However La + GFAP + dot-like structures on the outer surface of blood vessels were noted at a higher magnification (Fig. 3C5) .",

The co-localization of GFAP and ColI or ColIII was clearly detected apart from in the structures of blood vessels (Fig. 3D,E) . However, ColIV was not co-localized with GFAP (Fig. 3F) , and was mainly detected in the structures of blood vessels (Fig. 3F1, 3F3 ) and arachnoid cells (Fig. 3F1, 3F3 ). ColI and ColIII were distributed in a similar manner except for their association with blood vessels. Intensive expression of ColIII in the wall of blood vessels was observed (Fig. 3E1, E3, E4) , whereas the association of ColI with the structure of blood vessels was not marked (Fig. 3D) . A low-level expression of laminin and collagen in the brain parenchyma of sham-infected mice has been reported. 7 Here for a comparison, we present the results of studies on ColIII and ColIV in the sham-infected mice (Fig. 3G) , which were not shown in our previous report. In the brains of sham-infected mice, low-level expression of ColIII was detected in a line of arachnoid cells. Activated astrocytes that produced ColIII were not observed, and ColIII + GFAP + figures were obtained only as dot-like structures (Fig. 3G1 ) in the sham-infected mice. ColIVexpression in the brain parenchyma of sham-infected mice was also not marked (Fig. 3G2 ). In the present study, we did not perform a statistical analysis of the relationship between viral antigens and ECM expression, because the areas we examined are not the main viral entry site into the brain parenchyma. 4,5,7 However, we found a tendency whereby a higher ECM expression occurred in the areas where viral antigens were detected (Fig. 3H ).",

            "text": "A question that arises is why these astrocytes are producing several kinds of ECMs after infection. In order to answer this, we focused on the expression of IFN\u03b2, a type I interferon, among several cytokines. Reportedly, MHV infection in vitro inhibits IFN\u03b2 production, although the level of IFN\u03b2 is elevated in the brain after infection with neuropathogenic MHV strains. 19, 20 A reason for this discrepancy was clarified by our in vivo study. The infected cells in the ventricle and ventricular wall during the early phase of infection did not produce IFN\u03b2, but the cells surrounding the infected cells did (Fig. 6A1) . Furthermore, deep in the brain parenchymal area of the pons where no viral antigens were detected, IFN\u03b2-positive cells were found (Fig. 6A2) . How did these cells, away from the infected site, get the information on infection? We propose that astrocytes form an astrocytic reticular network (ARN), which creates a conduit system in a similar fashion to FRN found in lymphoid organs, by producing ECMs including ERag, a maker of FRN. 21 In support of this, a fine astrocytic network was found to surround the IFN\u03b2-producing cells deep in the pontine parenchyma (Fig. 6B) , where no viral antigens are found during the early phase of infection, 4, 7 and tissue destruction has yet to occur (Fig. 6C) . Furthermore, spotty ERag + areas were connected by astrocytic foot processes (Fig. 6C ).",

            "text": "Using the brain primary culture, we confirmed the findings of a previous report 7 that showed the in vivo production of ERag by many types of cells in the CNS during the early phase of infection with cl-2. In addition, we showed that the neuro-virulent viruses can induce the production of ECMs other than ERag in the brain parenchymal cells, especially astrocytes, producing major components of mature ERfibs including ERag, laminin and Col. Studies in vivo on the later phase of infection at 72 hpi, where an enhanced expression of ECM in the brain appeared compared with that in the earlier phase, enable us to see more clearly that the areas of laminin expression were more widely spread than the ERag-positive areas, compared with our previous study. 7 Although the interaction of astrocytic laminin and surrounding conditions, mainly in the areas of the blood brain barrier (BBB), [22] [23] [24] or in the developmental brain, 25 has been studied, the interaction of laminin and ERag expression has not been clarified, because astrocytic ERag production has not been reported except in our previous study. 7 The earlier production of laminin by astrocytes prior to ERag expression 7 might have stimulated ERag production through autocrine effects on the function of astrocytes, because astrocytic laminin is necessary for some of their functions, shown by the fact that a lack of the laminin \u03b12 subunit produced by astrocytes induces hypertrophic endfeet of astrocytes and obstructs appropriate polarization of aquaporin 4 expressed on astrocytes in the BBB. 22 Furthermore, the modulation and organization of astrocytic laminin levels mediate glianeuronal commitment. 23 Another possibility is that astrocytic laminin restricts ERag expression, leading to narrower areas of ERag expression compared with laminin-positive areas. Astrocytic laminin prevents the differentiation of pericytes, which have been shown to express ERag in the 6 Frozen sections were prepared from the pons of mice infected with cl-2 at 48 hours post-infection (hpi) when viral invasion into the brain parenchyma is still not prominent, 4, 6 and were processed to detect mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM virus (JHMV) (V), interferon \u03b2 (IFN\u03b2), GFAP (Gf) and ER-TR7 antigen (ERag) (Er). IVv and Mx indicate the fourth ventricle and meninx, respectively. IFN\u03b2 production was observed either in the ventricle near viral antigens (A1), in the area away from the ventricle where no viral antigens are detectable at 48 hpi shown as dotted area in A1 and at a higher magnification (A2), or in the middle of the pons in the area of the gigantocellular reticular nucleus away from both the ventricle and meninx (B). C: Long arrows indicate blood vessels surrounded by astrocytes with ERag expression (C1), which do not show any connection with one another in the image with ERag-staining alone (C2). The areas with low expression levels of GFAP or ERag indicated by boxed areas in C1 with an arrowhead and short arrows are shown at higher magnifications in C3 and C4, respectively, which revealed that ERag expression near (C4) and away from blood vessels (C3) is connected with fine networks of astrocytic fibers. Single and double bars indicate 100 and 20 \u03bcm, respectively. brain after infection, 7 from the resting stage to contractile stage. 24 It is noteworthy that the contractile pericytes are one of the ERag-producing cell types in lymph nodes. 13 In constrast to laminin expression, Col expression was more closely associated with that of ERag, taking the form of a fibrous structure. The ERfibs in the lymphid organs have collagen fibers as a core that are wrapped by ERag-positive ECM, and finally surrounded by laminin at the outermost surface. 26 The findings in the primary cultures indicated the process of forming mature ERfibs in the brain. That is, immediately after the secretion of collagen and ERag from astrocytes, or before the secretion, they form intimate contact with each other, and form a fibrous structure. Subsequently, the fibers are packed in the astrocytic laminin prepared in the form of a membranous sheet structure.",

In brain primary cultures, there are clusters of neuronal cells, which disappear after infection leaving scattered neuronal cells. 17 Another discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro studies is that we did not find ColIII-producing astrocytes in vitro, while astrocytic ColIII was clearly detected in vivo after infection. However, Heck et al. demonstrated that astrocytes secrete fibrillar ColI, III and V in culture, while they found no astroglial collagen expression in vivo in normal rats. 27 They adopted different procedures from ours for primary culture, obtaining a large population of astrocytes in the culture, and continued cultures for a longer period than we did. The finding that they did not detect astrocytic Col in vivo using immunofluorescence, which led to their interpretation of why previous neuroscientists had concluded that the brain is the only organ that lacks fibrillary elements such as collagen fibers, 28 corresponds to our previous report 7 that showed ColIII expression was low-level in the brain except for the meninges and ventricles during the early phase of infection. Since ColI expression in the astrocytes was more intensive than that of ColIII, ColI may be a better marker for studying ECM production in the brain parenchyma after brain injury.",

            "text": "Like laminin, collagen is considered to be an indispensable ECM for CNS functions and morphogenesis, including that of astrocytes, neurons 28, 29 and oligodendrocytes. 30 If so, Col and laminin should exist in the brain parenchyma besides the meninges or perivascular areas of animals in the normal state. A limitation to detect a small amount of ECM using the available techniques ,including a light microscopical approach, had led to the misinterpretation by neuroscientists as Heck et al. pointed out and as described earlier. 28 The reticular fiber that comprises the FRN in the lymph nodes is around 1 \u03bcm in diameter. 26 We detected the fine network of astrocytic fibers and ERfibs only at a high magnification of a confocal laser scanning microscope, which has insufficient resolution to trace the initial conduit that transfers the message of viral invasion deep into the brain parenchyma. One thin line of ERfib might function as a conduit to activate astrocytes deep in the parenchyma after the recognition of viral invasion at the ventricular wall or brain surface facing the arachnoid membrane. Although it is important for medical treatment to handle an initial immune response after infection in the brain, little is known about how the immune network is constructed in the brain. Our experimental model using an extremely neurovirulent viral clone, cl-2, and an attenuated mutant, Mu-3, provides an opportunity to investigate reticular network formation after infection in the brain.",

At 24 and 48 hours post-infection (hpi) (V (24 hpi) and V (48 hpi), respectively), culture slides were processed to detect ER-TR7 antigen (ERag) (Er), mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM virus (JHMV) (V), laminin (La), and collagen III (Col). Hoechst 33 342 (H) was used for nuclear counter-staining. E: A Z-stack study with a 0.5-\u03bcm step size, as illustrated in E4, revealed La-positive (La + ) lace curtain-like structures in E3 at the 12th step (z12), which is located 4 \u03bcm above z8 (E1). At a higher resolution in E than that in C and D, only a minor population of La + fibers was found to co-localize with ERag-positive fibers (ERfibs), in contrast to the high numbers of Col + fibers co-localized with ERag (F). G: A cluster of cells producing both ERag and Col is shown, which also contrasts with an image of La production (D). Long arrows indicate a fiber with co-localization of ERag and laminin. Short arrows in E3 indicate holes in the laminin sheet. The arrowhead indicates the nucleus. Single and double bars indicate 50 and 20 \u03bcm, respectively.",
