PRRSV is the cause of severe respiratory and reproductive disease in swine worldwide. The virus emerged as a swine pathogen in North America and Europe nearly simultaneously in the period 1980\u20131990 (Zimmerman et al., 2012). Quickly, nucleotide sequence comparisons of the prototypical isolates Lelystad virus and VR-2332 revealed that the European (EU) and North American (NA) isolates were only distantly related. Later, the EU and NA genotypes were officially designated as Type 1 (PRRSV-1) and Type 2 (PRRSV-2), respectively (Faaberg et al., 2012). Following the expansion of our understanding of arterivirus evolution and discovery of many new genera in the family of Arteriviridae, it was recently proposed to separate PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 into two different species (Kuhn et al., 2016).",

Similar differences in APPs profiles displayed by four PRRSV-1, subtype 1 strains were recently described by Saco et al. (2016) who identified strong correlation between APP (in particular Hp) concentration in serum and the severity of clinical signs. Clinical scores in pigs exposed to EU-17 PRRSV-1 strain inducing highest Hp response, and to JA142 PRRSV-2 strain inducing highest CRP response, where highest (Saco et al., 2016). In our study, BOR59 infected pigs showed the earliest increase in CRP levels but both BOR59 and ILI6 infected pigs had significantly higher levels of CRP at 10 DPI compared to pigs infected with the 18794 strain. Striking differences were observed in Hp levels where BOR95 pigs showed an unusual early response at 3 DPI while the response in other groups was absent or minimal (Fig. 3). It corresponds well with the previously reported greater and more common responsiveness of CRP than Hp towards PRRSV infection (Heegaard et al., 2011, Saco et al., 2016). This observation indicates that BOR59 infection is able to stimulate a rapid Hp response, possibly by activating neutrophils to release pre-stored Hp. Such a mechanism has been described for Hp (Theilgaard-Monch et al., 2006) but not for CRP. This finding is another indication that BOR59 is more virulent than ILI6 (and 18794).",

Nevertheless, despite wide range of lesions in each of the experimental groups, BOR59 infected pigs (especially those necropsied at 17 DPI) had generally most evident microscopic lung lesions. As with clinical signs, the lack of gross lesions together with the minor microscopic lesions could result from lack of co-infections in the used pigs of very high sanitary status.",

These cells produce eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), which can damage the RNA virus, they are also able to present antigens to other cells and capable of phagocytosis and cytotoxicity (Giembycz and Lindsay, 1999, Gleich et al., 1986, Jacobsen et al., 2007). On the other hand, eosinophils may modify inflammation in the lungs through cytokines release and they can also promote fibrosis of the lungs by producing factors participating in transformation of fibroblasts into fibrocytes and myofibrocytes (Akuthota et al., 2010, Giembycz and Lindsay, 1999, Jacobsen et al., 2007). In general, the amount of eosinophils in lung tissues was small but highest in pigs infected with BOR59 strain.",

The results indicate that the strain BOR59 can be considered a high pathogenic PRRSV-1 virus, similarly to previously evaluated Belarusian Lena and SU1-bel (Karniychuk et al., 2010, Morgan et al., 2013). Pathogenicity of BOR59 for conventional pigs, as well as a deep genetic characterization of this strain, remains to be assessed. More efforts should be made in Europe and elsewhere to study complete genomes of PRRSV-1 and to study the genetic characteristics of unusually virulent strains, especially from Eastern European genetic subtypes.",
