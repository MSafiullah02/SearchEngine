While the quest for novel potent antiviral agents continues, the strategy of combined antiviral therapy with available antiviral drugs is potentially beneficial, and has, in fact, proven its usefulness for a number of viral dis-eases. Enhanced antiviral efficacy of combined treatment is mediated by synergistic or additive activity of the combination, antiviral activities in a broad range of viral reservoirs, broad coverage of established resistant viral populations and prevention of antiviral resistance. In addition, combined treatment with two synergistically active drugs may enable dose reduction of the toxic components of the combination.",

In view of the rapidly evolving field of antiviral therapy, a second edition of this successful meeting was organized by The Macrae Group in Barcelona, Spain on September 8 10, 1996. Again, leading researchers in the laboratory and clinical fields reviewed the successes and limitations of current antiviral monotherapy and the status of combined therapy. This article provides a review of the information presented at this symposium, and where appropriate, the consensus reached in certain areas based on this information.",

Secondly, the role of the immune system in the disease process is not well understood. The secondary effects of the inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, which lead to the symptoms of disease may actually be more problematic than the virus infection itself. Thirdly, easily administered, cost-effective and efficacious antiviral agents are not widely available, with the possible exception of amantadine and rimantadine for influenza A virus infections. Finally, the significant mortality of respiratory virus infections in highrisk populations has only recently been appreciated.",

For this purpose, new improved vaccines and adjuvants are available, as well as a variety of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for passive immunoprophylaxis.

Topically administered GG167 has been shown to be highly effective as a prophylactic agent . For therapeutic purposes, a reduction in viral titers and symptomatology was observed only when the drug was given within 24 h after the onset of symptoms . No differences between GG167 and placebo in viral titers or symptoms were observed when the drug was administered at a later timepoint. Another drawback, which may limit the use of this agent, is the poor bioavailability of the drug. Antiviral effects are only observed when the drug is administered topically.",

Viral resistance against ribavirin has not been observed, presumably due to the multiple mechanisms of action of this agent (Patterson and Fernandez-Larsson, 1990 ). However, the antiviral potency of the drug is limited, and the role of ribavirin treatment remains controversial (Levin, 1994) . Current standard treatment of severe RSV disease in high-risk children consists of aerosolized ribavirin at a dosage of 20 mg/ml given over 12-18 h daily. The long duration of administration has a number of disadvantages, including compliance problems, health hazards from exposure of the drug to personnel, and contamination of the environment. For this reason, the safety and efficacy of high dose treatment during 6 h/day has been studied, and was shown to be safe and equally effective when compared to the standard regimen, while environmental contamination was reduced.",

Improved treatment strategies are thus clearly needed in this patient population. Combined treatment with ribavirin and immunoglobulins, if instituted early during the course of infection, has shown promising results (Whimbey et al., 1995) . In a small uncontrolled study, hospitalized bone marrow transplant-recipients with RSV pneumonia were treated with aerosolized ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulins. The mortality rate was 100% in untreated patients and patients treated late in the course of infection, i.e. patients who were already ventilation-dependent or were approaching this stage. Strikingly, in patients treated early in the course of disease, the mortality rate was reduced to 22%. Preliminary results show a similar trend in leukemic patients with RSV pneumonia.

In this patient group, the virus load is high, spontaneous clearance is slow, and the manifestations of infection can be severe.

For CMV retinitis, all three drugs have been shown to be effective as monotherapy in prolonging the time to recurrence ( Van der Meer et al., 1996) . However, despite chronic maintenance therapy, relapses of retinitis almost invariably occur. In part, this may be due to the acquisition of suboptimal intraocular drug-concentrations during systemic therapy. While the problem of drug delivery can be circumvented by intravitreal administration, this does not protect against the development of retinitis in the contralateral eye or of CMV disease elsewhere. Another important cause of failure of maintenance therapy is the development of viral resistance. The emergence of virus variants with reduced susceptibility to foscarnet and ganciclovir during prolonged monotherapy is well documented, and is associated with increases in plasma CMV load during treatment (Boivin et al., 1996) . Ganciclovir resistance is conferred by specific mutations in the UL97 gene, which encodes for the viral phosphotransferase responsible for the first phosphorylation step. Resistance can also result from mutations in the gene encoding for the viral DNA polymerase. Since foscarnet does not require phosphorylation for its activity and cidofovir is already monophosphorylated, resistance to these drugs is conferred by amino acid changes in the viral DNA polymerase only. Dual, and even triple resistance to the respective drugs is commonly observed (Knox et al., 1991; Sarasini et al., 1995; Baldantini et al., 1996; Van der Meer et al., 1996) . It has been shown that high level, but not low level, ganciclovir-resistant virus variants are cross-resistant to cidofovir, indicating that specific mutations in the polymerase-gene are required for both cidofovir-resistance and high levels of ganciclovir resistance. In addition, reductions in foscarnet-susceptibility have been reported in ganciclovir-resistant virus isolates, and resistance to foscarnet seems to develop more rapidly in patients pretreated with ganciclovir, suggesting a degree of cross-resistance between ganciclovir and foscarnet as well. Interestingly, foscarnet-resistant virus appears to remain sensitive to cidofovir, as is the case for low level ganciclovir resistant virus.",

HHV-8 sequences have been detected in KS lesions of all forms, including classic-, African endemic-and HIV-associated KS, as well as in the blood, lymphoid tissue, and unaffected skin of KS patients (Ambroziak et al., 1995; Boshoff et al., 1995a,b; De Lellis et al., 1995; Huang et al., 1995; Schalling et al., 1995; Bigoni et al., 1996; Humphrey et al., 1996; Noel et al., 1996; O'Neill et al., 1996) . Longitudinal studies suggested that the presence of HHV-8 in the blood is predictive of subsequent development of KS, which is supported by recent serologic studies (Lefrere et al., 1996; Lennette et al., 1996) . Beside KS, the presence of HHV-8 is also associated with lymphoproliferative malignancies, especially primary body cavity-based lymphomas, angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy, and Castleman's disease (Cesarman et al., 1995; Soulier et al., 1995; Luppi et al., 1996a,b; Nador et al., 1996; Otsuki et al., 1996; Robert et al., 1996; Said et al., 1996; Sander et al., 1996) . Epidemiological studies using serology suggest that sexual transmission of HHV-8 is likely, consistent with the reported detection of HHV-8 sequences in semen and prostate (Gao et al., 1996; Kedes et al., 1996; Lennette et al., 1996; Monini et al., 1996) .",

Epidemiological studies and a small number of uncontrolled case histories suggest that foscarnet may reduce the risk of developing KS and result in remission of established KS (Morfeldt and Torssander, 1994; Glesby et al., 1996) . Based on these reports, several studies are currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of foscarnet in the treatment of HIV-associated KS.

As progression of liver disease is driven by viral replication and immune-destruction of hepatocytes, treatment may be targeted at both the immune system and inhibition of viral replication. The only approved treatment for chronic hepatitis B is interferon alpha, which predominantly appears to act by amplifying the existing immune response, resulting in immune lysis of infected hepatocytes, but also has antiviral activity. Only approximately 40% of patients with chronic HBV hepatitis and 35% of cirrhotic patients respond to interferon therapy, as measured by clearance of HBV DNA. Patients with active hepatitis, as reflected by increased serum transaminase levels, detectable hepatitis Be antigen, low HBV DNA levels, and active liver histology generally show the best responses to interferon therapy, while very few responses are observed in the immunotolerant phase of infection with minimal hepatitis (Brook et al., 1989) .",

Combined treatment with interferon alpha and levamisole or interferon gamma have not proven to be beneficial (Fattovich et al., 1992; Bosch et al., 1993; Ruiz-Moreno et al., 1993) . There is no consensus on the role of pretreatment with prednisone before interferon therapy (Cohard et al., 1994) . Due to its immunosuppressive activity, treatment with prednisone allows for increased viral replication, resulting in increased expression of antigens and, on stopping, rebound immunity, which can lead to enhanced elimination of infected hepatocytes during subsequent interferon therapy. While several studies have indeed shown enhanced viral clearance during interferon therapy after withdrawal of prednisone, a metanalysis suggested that these benefits are re-stricted to patients with low ALT levels (Cohard et al., 1994) . Furthermore, the risk of side effects is higher and cases of hepatic decompensation during this regimen have been described. Since HBV-infected individuals who eliminate the virus after infection clearly differ from those who do not with respect to the CD8 lymphocyte response to HBV, immunostimulants which specifically enhance the TH1 cytotoxic immune response, e.g. interleukin-12, are potentially beneficial in the treatment of HBV infection (Milich et al., 1995) . Phase I/II studies with this cytokine are currently ongoing.",

Lamivudine (3TC), penciclovir and PMEA are nucleoside analogue inhibitors of the viral polymerase with potent antiviral activities in vitro (Heijtink et al., 1993; Shaw et al., 1994) . In clinical studies, 100% suppression of HBV DNA levels is observed in virtually all patients treated with lamivudine at dosages in excess of 100 mg/day, accompanied by clearance of HBe antigen in some patients (Benhamou et al., 1995; Dienstag et al., 1995) . However, as observed in 6-month studies of lamivudine treatment, relapses of viral replication usually occur following cessation of therapy. The high relapse rate can be explained by the stability and persistence of the covalently closed circular intermediate of HBV DNA (cccDNA), which, if unaffected, acts as a transcriptional template following withdrawal of therapy. In animal model studies, it has been shown that the level of cc-cDNA is only minimally affected when total viral replication is suppressed less than 90%. In pekin ducks, greater than 90% suppression of total HBV DNA levels, accompanied by declines in the amount of cccDNA, was only observed during treatment with penciclovir or high doses of PMEA, and not with lamivudine. However, even after 6 months of penciclovir therapy, minimal amounts of cccDNA could still be detected in the duck-hepatocytes, which rapidly returned to pretreatment values following therapy withdrawal.",

In vitro, the antiviral activity of interferon alpha is enhanced by lamivudine (Korba, 1996) . However, in clinical studies of this combination, interferon alpha does not appear to confer a marked additional benefit when compared to lamivudine alone, which may be explained by the lamivudineinduced reduction in antigen-expressing cells. Theoretically, immune amplification may nevertheless be important for curative therapy, especially in chronic persistent hepatitis. Studies of the viral dynamics of HBV infection indicate that the half-life of infected cells during active disease is only approximately 10 days due to immune lysis (Nowak et al., 1996) . Based on this short half-life, it can be estimated that, in case of complete suppression of viral replication by antiviral agents, eradication of HBV would require approximately 1 year of treatment, which could theoretically be shortened to less than 1 year if immunomodulatory agents were to be added. However, during chronic persistent hepatitis in which immune lysis does not occur, the half-life of infected cells has been calculated to be markedly longer, ranging from 10 to 100 days. With this long half-life, curative therapy would require many years of treatment, and modulation of the immune system to enhance immune lysis theoretically seems important.",

Several factors have been correlated with increased severity of disease, including the age, sex, and MHC class II phenotype of the host, and the genotype and quantity of the virus (Sherlock, 1995) . However, these factors have not proven to be particularly useful in the management of individual patients. Although there is no consensus on the issue of when and whom to treat, it may be recommended to monitor patients regularly, including histologic examination at 2-3 yearly intervals, and to focus treatment on patients who progress to moderate hepatitis. At later stages of the disease, when cirrhosis has developed, the rate of response to treatment is severely reduced. While the response rate to interferon in HCV infection is relatively low, it would also be helpful to predict which patients would benefit from treatment. Again, several host and viral factors are associated with poor responses to interferon treatment, but none of these are helpful in the individual patient. However, it has been shown that the early changes in plasma HCV RNA load during the first week of treatment are predictive of the response to treatment. While HCV RNA levels generally decline to below detectable levels within a few days in responders, non-responders show sustained levels during the first weeks of treatment. In the latter group, treatment could be stopped after 1-2 weeks of treatment. The occurrence of a relapse after withdrawal of therapy in initial responders cannot be predicted. However, since relapses generally occur within 6 9 months after completion of treatment, the response in patients who are still in remission at this stage will most likely be sustained.",

Coupled with the high mutability of HIV-1 RT, these persistent high levels of viral replication allow for the continuous generation of mutations in the viral genome, including those conferring drug-resistance (Coffin, 1995) . Since drug-resistant virus populations will thus be present before treatment is started, an important rationale of combined antiviral therapy is the activity against a broad range of these pre-existing mutants. An equally important reason for combined antiviral treatment is to improve suppression of viral replication, thereby diminishing the likelihood of the emergence of resistance-conferring mutations dur-ing treatment. Drug resistance will not develop when viral replication is completely suppressed, which is the ultimate goal of antiviral treatment.",

This is followed by a second slower phase, during which the virus load declines to below detectable levels.

In view of their carcinogenic potential, the identification of antiviral agents against HPV is desirable. However, progress in this field is hampered by the lack of a tissue culture system for screening of compounds. While inhibitors of viral replication have not been identified to date, treatment strategies may emerge with the increasing knowledge on the pathogenesis of HPV infections. These include the potential use of interferones, anti-oxidants, retinoids and a number of cytokines which may interfere with viral replication by affecting transcriptional pathways (Kelloff et al., 1995) .",

These include hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by Hantaan-, Seoul-, and Puumulaviruses, and the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), caused by the recently discovered Sin Nombre virus. In the treatment of HFRS, intravenous ribavirin has been proven effective in reducing the risk of reaching the oliguric phase, as well as the risk of hemorrhage and the mortality (Huggins et al., 1991) . In a small uncontrolled study comparing supportive care with ribavirin in the management of HPS, no beneficial effect of ribavirin treatment was observed (Anon., 1993) . However, possibly due to a diagnostic delay, virtually all clinical events had occurred before sufficient ribavirin levels were attained. The rarity of this syndrome since the outbreak in 1993 has precluded further evaluation of ribavirin treatment for HPS. Beside ribavirin, other antiviral agents against hantaviruses have not been identified.",

In addition, small outbreaks of Ebola virus infections have been documented in the US and Italy, which were all caused by imported primates, the source of which could be traced to a single primate exporter in the Philippines. Research on the development of antiviral agents against Ebola virus is currently ongoing in the US Army Medical Research Institute. Random screening of compounds against Ebola virus is hardly feasible because of the high laboratory biosafety level (level 4) required for filovirus research. For this reason, other viruses were sought which could be predictive of the antiviral activity of compounds against filoviruses. In view of their similar molecular organization, paramyxoviruses, including parainfluenza virus and RSV, were proven to be good candidates for this purpose. Using this method, several classes of compounds with potential anti-filovirus activity were identified, including RNA polymerase inhibitors and inhibitors of the enzyme s-adenosylcysteine hydrolase. The latter class of agents has especially been subject to extensive research. In a newly designed mouse model for Ebola virus, high dose prophylaxis with this class of compounds was shown to be protective of infection with Ebola virus. The prophylactic efficacy of high anti-Ebola IgG titres was also evaluated in this model, and showed a 25% increase in the survival. While the efficacy of both treatment strategies was markedly less in primates, which obviously are more similar to humans with respect to pharmacokinetics and the pathogenesis of disease, the results of this challenging research are interesting, and may point the way to effective intervention or prophylaxis against this deadly virus.",

The considerable progress in the field of antiretroviral therapy has even ignited cautious optimism about curative therapy of HIV-1 infection. However, the long-tern follow-up of treatment with current potent antiretroviral regimens needs to be awaited, and several questions regarding the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection still need to be addressed.",
