Recent emergence events, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and most recently Influenza A H1N1 (swine flu), have captured the popular imagination for their perceived (or actual) threat to humanity. Given that direct-contact transmitted HIV has caused around 60 million infections and 30 million deaths [2], the fear of a highly pathogenic airborne pathogen is justified. Because of the potential for a devastating pandemic, EVs have been identified as an existential threat to civilization [3].",

The latter focuses on the behavioral, environmental and genetic influences on population-level patterns in disease manifestation. Although these approaches have been, in many respects, tremendously successful, one shortcoming is that they are largely responsive, rather than predictive, and thus cannot distinguish potential epidemics from sporadic, spillover diseases [5].",

            "text": "A new approach, called evolutionary epidemiology, is based on virus evolutionary ecology and has greater potential to generate predictive models of virus emergence 4, 6. This approach assumes that disease processes are the products of fundamental biological variables. An explosion of theoretical studies has emphasized such parameters as mutation rate, gene flow, contact rate, duration of infection and host population dynamics 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Many of these theoretical studies point to virus basic reproductive ratio, R\n0, as the single most important epidemiological parameter. R\n0 is defined as the mean number of secondary cases a typical single infected case will cause in a population 18, 19. Theoretically, if virus R\n0>1, then the virus will tend to spread epidemically, and if not, the virus will disappear (Box 1\n).Box 1Epidemiology and population biology of infectious diseasesIn population biology, the change a population of size, N, is expressed similarly by the differential equation,(1)dNdt=(B+I\u2212D\u2212E)Nwhere B=birth, I=immigration, D=death and E=emigration rates, respectively. These terms are usually subsumed into one parameter, the per capita growth rate r, such that(2)dNdt=rNIn biology, r is significant because it is a measure of absolute fitness if construed for a particular genotype. In ecological theory, a source population is defined as one where r\n > 0, whereas a sink shows r<0. As defined, a source exhibits positive population growth and will continue to grow insofar as resources are available. By contrast, a sink shows negative population growth and will decline to eventual extinction unless rescued by either migration or adaptation.Classic epidemiological models divide populations into compartments representing susceptible (S), infectious (I) and removed (R, i.e. recovered or dead) individuals (Figure I\n). The compartments are dynamic in that individuals are entering and egressing each compartment over time. The change in the number of susceptible individuals over time depends on host birth rate and recovered individuals losing immunity. Passage from susceptible to infectious compartments depends on \u03b2, the rate constant of infectious transfer of viruses. Individuals are removed from the infectious compartment either by dying or recovering and gaining immunity. The removal rate is expressed by the variable \u03b3. A set of three differential equations describes these transitions,(3)dSdt=\u2212\u03b2SI\n(4)dIdt=\u03b2SI\u2212\u03b3I\n(5)dRdt=\u03b3IThe most important epidemiological parameter is the basic reproductive number, R\n0\n[18], which is given by the equation(6)R0=\u03b2N\u03b3If R\n0\n \n>\n 1, then the pathogen spreads epidemically; if R\n0\n \n<\n 1, then the pathogen will die out.Epidemiological theory overlaps population biology because it is here that R\n0 can be connected to source/sink theory as follows,(7)r=ln(R0)tThis overlap permits application of the broader tenets of evolutionary ecological theory to infectious diseases, and, more specifically, can guide the investigation of disease emergence.",

The conventional wisdom is that, if we want to understand emergence, viruses should be studied in vivo or in mammalian cell culture models. However, from an evolutionary epidemiological standpoint, this approach is often impractical. In general, mammalian cell culture is somewhat trickier and more expensive than bacterial culture (even with regard to the relatively simple culture of HeLa) [20]. Cultured cells grow slowly and are prone to degeneration [21], contamination 22, 23, contact inhibition and differentiation [20] confounding results. Other factors include the fact that most primary cells have a limited lifespan (hence the requirement for immortalized cell lines) and are less amenable to reverse genetics. Multihost cell systems only compound these issues. Finally, cell culture removes cells from the whole organism context, thus negating one of its supposed advantages.",

To understand this process, a systematic exploration of the sequence space of EVs might be required. For any particular virus\u2013host association, how many mutations permit emergence, and what are the fitness consequences of those mutations on native and novel host types?

DNA sequencing revealed that, out of 40 isolates, 39 possessed a mutation in the gene coding for capsid spike protein P3, which is implicated in host attachment. Of these 39 isolates, 16 were unique substitutions. Using a statistical procedure based on the coupon\u2013collection problem of probability theory [26], Ferris et al. estimate that 55 out of 4380, or 1.3%, of the possible nonsynonymous mutations in the P3 protein permit phage \u03a66 to infect P. glycinea\n[25]. This specific prediction can be tested by collecting and sequencing a large pool of host range mutants. Currently, the model takes into account differential mutation probabilities (e.g. transitions more likely than transversions) but refinement is probably required. For example, the model can be further constrained by considering codon bias.",

Founder effects commonly include reductions in fitness and genetic diversity [27]. The primary means of recovering genetic diversity is by mutation, but it has been shown that the majority of new mutations are deleterious [28]. Thus, the effects of emergence under these conditions could be analogous to a mutation\u2013accumulation experiment. Here, organisms are serially passaged with severe bottlenecking on each passage such that ability of natural selection to remove non-lethal deleterious mutations is abolished. Bottlenecking inherent in the virus transmission process is probably exacerbated for EVs where within-host reproduction is low [29]. Such bottlenecking has been demonstrated to significantly reduce fitness with the phage MS2 [30]. Here, 20 passages with bottlenecking were sufficient to reduce phage fitness by almost two orders of magnitude. Given that each round of bottlenecking led to a fitness loss (up to 16% in some cases), within-host reproduction is expected to be reduced, thus probably increasing the bottleneck for future transmission events.

Excessive virulence will lead to host death before transmission is effected and therefore leads to reductions in virus fitness. Empirical data from bacteriophage support this point. In phage \u03a66 infections of P. phaseolicola, a negative correlation was observed between initial viral inoculum and virus growth rate [36]. The presumed mechanism for this result was a \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d phenomenon where the renewable resource (bacterial hosts) was killed off before they had an opportunity to reproduce, thus reducing system-wide phage productivity.

This phage establishes persistent infections of Escherichia coli cells where progeny are extruded from infected cells. Host cells suffer reduced growth, but are not killed, thus phage can also reproduce via vertical transmission. Messenger et al. experimentally manipulated the rates of horizontal and vertical transmission [37]. In the vertical transmission treatment, secreted phages were prevented from infecting new hosts. In the horizontal treatment, persistently infected cells were removed from lysates containing secreted phage. Following 24 days of treatment, phage and bacterial reproductive rates were assayed. Results indicated that natural selection favored increased virus virulence in horizontal treatment and decreased virulence in vertical treatment, corresponding to the expectations of the tradeoff hypothesis.",

Because of their tractability, phage studies have contributed significantly in this regard and have shown that fitness consequences of host range expansion mutations can be broad 25, 38. In human viruses, some circumstantial evidence points to frequent mismatches between virus growth and transmission. An anecdotal view seems to point to EVs frequently showing excessive virulence. For example, Ebola virus has been relatively unsuccessful perhaps because of its excessive virulence [39]. Other emerging pathogens, such as those causing avian influenza and SARS, were also highly lethal, and perhaps for this reason, did not spread widely. Perhaps intuitively this makes sense because the new hosts are not yet adapted to the emerging pathogen, but this argument cuts both ways. Pathogens are not yet evolved to new hosts. Moreover, this view is obviously skewed in that relatively benign EVs might not have achieved high visibility precisely because of their lack of virulence. Interestingly, studies show that most host range mutations in phages reduce virus growth rates 25, 40. The usual supposition is that virulence and lytic phage growth are directly correlated, although this might not be strictly true for other organisms [41]. Nevertheless, we can speculate that the inability of a virus to productively replicate in a new host might reduce its ability to reduce the fitness of a host. As such, we might expect that the majority of EVs could actually be relatively non-virulent. This conjecture is supported by mathematical modeling suggesting that less virulent pathogens are more likely to emerge [8]. Without further research, however, we cannot do more than speculate about the average virulence of EVs and their propensities to fully emerge.",

Likewise, a newly emerged virus usually experiences a reduction in fitness on its original host 38, 46 but has not yet had an opportunity to adapt to its new host. In fact, circumstantial evidence suggests that the basic reproductive rate, R\n0 is <1 for most EVs (Box 1) 47, 48. This relative lack of local adaptation, and other factors such as demographic stochasticity, mutation accumulation and competition, might make it difficult for EVs to spread widely beyond their initial appearance. Thus, most emergence events probably are temporally transient [5]. An important consideration is that, because of fitness tradeoffs, most EVs are poorly adapted to novel hosts relative to native hosts. As such, EVs can initially show R\n0<1, but to fully emerge, their R\n0 must surpass 1.",

Unfortunately, few experimental studies have explored how adaptation occurs in multihost habitats. If a fitness tradeoff encourages host specialization, how do viruses \u201cdecide\u201d which host to focus on? This question is addressed in studies of phage T7 infecting E. coli where Heineman et al. apply optimal foraging theory to phage host range evolution [58]. Their results showed that T7 rapidly evolved to discriminate among different E. coli strains when one host strain was engineered to kill infecting phages but the other remained productive. In further experiments, the T7 study showed that host ratio and quality were important factors in determining whether host specialization was favored among phages. Host specialization was favored when better quality hosts were common and when there were large differences in host quality.",

Their model suggests that host range should be negatively correlated with host abundance. That is, when hosts are abundant, it pays for phage to specialize on a single host type. Guyader and Burch confirm the predictions of their model using phages \u03a6X174 and G4, a generalist and a specialist, respectively. When the density of E. coli C and Salmonella typhimurium was high, the specialist G4 (infecting only E. coli C) was selectively favored. When host densities were low, \u03a6X174, a phage able to infect both host types, was competitively superior. However, neither phage was able to evolve the alternate strategy when experimentally evolved under conditions favoring that strategy. When G4 was evolved at low host densities, it did not gain the ability to infect S.\ntyphimurium, nor did \u03a6X174 evolve a reduced host range when passaged at high host densities.

Some viruses can undergo an additional process termed reassortment owing to the segmented nature of their genomes. In reassortment, hybrid progeny are created when two or more viruses infect the same cell. In the cell, replicated segments are packaged into capsids regardless of the parent of origin, thus progeny can contain segments from both parents (Figure 1\n).

The accelerating effect of migration is predicted to be particularly important in cases where local fitness is positively density-dependent. Here, migration increases resident genotype productivity by inflating local population density [52]. That is, if population growth of the pathogen is positively density-dependent, then migration can actually facilitate adaptation by enhancing local fitness of the pathogen.

All else being equal, the lower the initial fitness of the EVs is in the sink, the more difficult full emergence might be [71]. If most novel beneficial mutations are limited in their impact on fitness, then it might take considerable time for enough beneficial mutations to accumulate to permit sink escape. The longer r<0 (Box 1), the greater the probability of extinction. However, there is some evidence of increased numbers of mutations of large effect when fitness is low [72]. The consequence of large effect beneficial mutations is that they might have multiple pleiotropic effects across the phenotype of an organism, which means it might be hard to predict precisely how EVs will differ from their ancestral progenitors. Virus fitness can also vary with host condition. If host immune systems are compromised in some way, then the initial r of the pathogen is higher, so initial adaptation might be quicker, and also the descendent emergent strain might be more similar overall in its properties to the ancestral strain.",

Spatially restricted migration led to the evolution of reproductive \u201crestraint\u201d, whereas unrestricted migration selected for \u201crapacious\u201d phage. In the latter treatment, phage that excessively exploited their habitat fell prey to the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d by eliminating their resource (i.e. lysing bacteria before they had opportunity to reproduce), thus slower phage growth was selected for. By contrast, the former treatment reduced the chance of population extinction by providing phage greater opportunity for fresh resources. These results are generally supported by theory suggesting that increased population viscosity favors cooperation [81].",

One interesting approach uses insects, such as Galleria mellonella and Drosophila melanogaster, as models for current and emerging diseases [83].

In other words, the approach taken here is \u201cnecessary, but not sufficient\u201d for a broad understanding of the evolution of disease emergence. Phage/bacteria systems are limited in their ability to capture the complexities of within-host growth typical of metazoan systems. Specifically, the interplay between various metazoan cell types and tissues and metazoan viruses cannot be captured in prokaryotic systems. Coevolution concomitant with viral within-host population dynamics and host immune response are important in humans for instance, but can be more safely ignored in bacteria because of the ability to store bacteria in frozen stasis. Such coevolutionary processes could provide important constraints to virus evolutionary ecology, impacting their between-host dynamics. Another important limitation is that it is difficult to precisely simulate with bacteria the degrees of mixing that occur between different host species of metazoan viruses. For instance, avian influenza could result from very limited contact between avian and human species such that a single or few human hosts (super spreaders) can have a disproportionate influence on viral emergence [84]. Bacterial populations in laboratory settings, by contrast, are relatively homogeneous.",

Population characteristics, such as host density, host frequency, contact rate, spatial/temporal heterogeneity and community structure, should figure prominently in the persistence or extinction of new virus genotypes. These parameters are much more amenable to manipulation in bacteriophage systems. The hope is that bacteriophage research can identify important themes and parameters for viral persistence and identify areas worthy of significant effort for more sophisticated model systems. This effort is not without additional benefit. Bacteria are also a major source of infectious disease. Most studies overlook the impact of bacteriophages on bacterial population and evolutionary dynamics. Ongoing evolutionary dynamics among bacterial strains and their phages could be an important \u2018hidden player\u2019 in many infectious disease systems that are as yet poorly understood.",
