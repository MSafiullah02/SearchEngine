According to Gilbert (2005), the basic feature that distinguishes compassion from other similar concepts such as empathy, sympathy and altruism is that it has the desire to resolve the pain, the cognitive process of understanding the source of pain and the behavioral process related to performing compassionate actions (Gilbert 2005). At the same time, compassion is formed by a combination of motive, emotion, thought and behavior. In the studies of Sprecher and Fehr (2005), compassion is conceptualized as compassionate (sensitive) love. Compassionate (sensitive) love is defined as an attitude toward humanity that involves behavior, feeling and thinking that focuses on concern, caring and support for humanity, as well as a motivation to understand and help humanity when they are most in need (\u0130\u015fg\u00f6r 2017b; Akdeniz and Deniz 2016).",

Self-compassion is defined as the self-attentive and understanding of the individual instead of criticizing himself in pain and failure situations, the understanding that the negative factors experienced by the individual are part of the common experiences of all people and the search for logical solutions rather than overcoming negative feelings and thoughts.",

Trust, honor, respect, effective communication skills, cooperation with patients and their families are concepts that are intertwined with the concept of compassion. These concepts are necessary for providing compassion, communication and high-quality care. For this reason, nurses should develop sufficient knowledge, technical skills, attitudes and interpersonal relationships for care and also have compassionate care (U\u011furlu and Aslan 2017; \u00c7ing\u00f6l et al. 2018). Nurses, who have been together with the patients for the longest time and who build more face to face communication, are the first applied profession group on all kinds of questions of the patients and their relatives. For this reason, it is important for nurses to show sensitive and compassionate behaviors toward patients and their relatives when they provide diagnosis and treatment services (Polat and Erdem 2017; Pommier 2011).",
