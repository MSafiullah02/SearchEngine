All these are examples of infectious diseases which are difficult to control, as they require real-time reporting to alert relevant surveillance systems.

Nevertheless, most infectious diseases are still being traditionally monitored by passive and reactive public health surveillance systems, which are officially maintained by national public health authorities. These traditional surveillance systems depend, to a large degree, upon data submitted to public health authorities by health professionals such as hospital physicians, laboratories, public health practitioners, and other health-care providers.",

Moreover, the substantial lags between the occurrence of an event and its official notification is common among public surveillance systems due to a number of reasons that govern traditional surveillance systems performance, including the rigid hierarchical structure and verification process dealing with receiving and notification of infectious and communicable diseases. These reasons, among others, led to late or failed reporting of the event to those in charge to take the right action for containment and control of the spread of infectious diseases.",

It has been reported that there is, on average, a lag time of at least 2 weeks from receipt of the infectious disease event to dissemination of the data by traditional surveillance systems (Cheng et al. 2009) while the availability of data on the internet and social media has been viewed as playing a better role in accelerating the process of informing both the public and governments about any looming public health threat, especially relating to infectious diseases.

Surveillance capacity for such detection can be expensive, and many countries lack the public health infrastructure to identify outbreaks at their earliest stages. The Internet is revolutionizing how epidemic intelligence is activated, and it offers solutions to some of these challenges. Social media and freely available web-based sources of information may allow us to detect disease outbreaks earlier with reduced cost and increased reporting transparency (Wilson and Brownstein 2009). Furthermore, the search and exchange of health information on the Internet and social media has been viewed as an opportunity to improve public health surveillance (Velasco et al. 2014; Kass-Hout and Alhinnawi 2013), and to monitor and predict emerging infectious diseases (Milinovich et al. 2014a, c).

Systems using informal electronic information have been credited with reducing the time to recognition of an outbreak, preventing governments from suppressing outbreak information, and facilitating public health responses to outbreaks and emerging diseases. A huge amount of real-time data and information about infectious disease outbreaks is found in various forms of web-based data streams (Brownstein et al. 2008; Freifeld et al. 2008; Brownstein and Freifeld 2007). The web-based data sources exist outside traditional reporting channels; therefore, they are invaluable to public health agencies that depend on timely information flow across national and subnational borders. These information sources, which can be identified through Internet-based tools and social media, are often capable of detecting the first evidence of an outbreak, especially in areas with a limited capacity for public health surveillance (Yang et al. 2013). For example, the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network rely on reporting data for day-to-day surveillance activities (M\u2019Ikanatha et al. 2004, 2006). The figure above shows the percentage of population who use the Internet by country.\n",

Recently, researchers have begun to leverage sensor network for public health: preventing, detecting and fighting infectious diseases. Researchers have shown, for example, that Twitter postings can be used to track and predict influenza (Krieck et al. 2011; Sadilek et al. 2012).

By manually examining a large number of tweets, they showed that self-reported symptoms are the most reliable signal in detecting if a tweet is relevant to an outbreak or not. Researchers have also tried capturing the overall trend of a particular disease outbreak, typically influenza, by monitoring social media (Culotta 2010). Other researchers focus on more detailed modeling of the language of tweets and their relevance to public health in general (Paul and Dredze 2011) and to influenza forecasting in particular (Paul et al. 2014; Broniatowski et al. 2013).",

The results of extensive data analytics and data mining need data visualization to enhance the presentation and communicate information clearly and efficiently to users via statistical graphics, plots, information graphics and charts. Effective visualization helps users in analyzing and reasoning about data and evidence. It makes complex data more accessible, understandable and usable.

When compared with the traditional surveillance systems, they found that people search more about a particular disease during an epidemic of the said disease. Thus, this pattern causes the emergence of Google Trends that counts how often people search for particular infectious disease related activity. Through this they estimate the burden of that particular disease in different countries.",

            "text": "Utilizing social media in the prevention and control of infectious diseases can be cost-effective. Social media has the unique advantage of being rapid and can be updated in a timely manner. If properly and scientifically utilized, social media can provide a sensitive and user friendly tool to monitor the distribution and determinants of epidemics both locally and at a global level. For example, systems like GT, present a novel and free tool that allows users to search for information with ease on the internet. This tool can also provide useful clues for understanding characteristics of the disease and the health-related behavior that influences its occurrence (Nuti et al. 2014). The use of social media in infectious disease epidemiology is, however, a new method of surveillance that is emerging. However, with advances in its use, it has the potential of providing an accurate and rapid estimation of the progression of diseases within communities. In addition, social media can be a valuable tool in providing values in distinct climatic and socio-economic context (Gluskin et al. 2014). Most developing countries do not have a periodically maintained and updated surveillance system for infectious diseases. Countries that own a functioning surveillance system suffer from delay in reporting and many sentinel sites miss out reporting of cases annually or periodically. Lack of resources in most developing countries also hinders communication, training of staff and provision of proper equipment (Madoff et al. 2011). Thus systems like GT, social media and other internet sources can provide a rapid method of surveillance that predicts the real time burden of disease and hence can guide preventive and curative strategies. Systems like GT could also work as a complementary system along with the traditional surveillance system in countries which have already established such systems.",

Firstly, most of the information provided is on social media and the internet not moderated by professionals before it gets disseminated online. Reliability of the data is also questionable as the source of information could be from trusted health specialists or from unofficial sources. Lack of standardization for frequency of updates further causes the problem to exacerbate, as too much information becomes available with questionable authenticity. Furthermore, applying algorithms and proper statistical techniques before making it publically available are not usually achieved. Robust monitoring and evaluation of the quality of data needs consideration for its proper usage of information retrieved from social media. (Velasco et al. 2014)",

(Velasco et al. 2014) Moreover, strategies and tools should be formulated to compare the traditional system with the online surveillance system, as some diseases can vary drastically. (Keller et al. 2009) Protection and privacy of data should be kept in mind by public health authorities before utilization. This is becoming more important, particularly when the surveillance tools that processes Internet or social media data are within governmental institutions. (Thompson et al. 2011). Future research should focus on factors that hinder the use of social media and internet-based data by health agencies. Social media, weblogs, scientific forums and other electronic communications also have unforeseen social aspects that need to be studied as it can affect human behavior. This in turn has an influence on the information generated by social media and the Internet in general. (Velasco et al. 2014)",
