Because vaccines are designed to induce protective immunity by mimicking infections in the human body, both live and inactivated vaccinations can theoretically trigger the development of ITP [15]. Researchers have investigated associations between multiple vaccinations and ITP risk, but findings regarding inactivated vaccinations were inconsistent [16\u201320]. However, because many vaccines are administered to children in infancy, an epidemiological study for vaccine safety conducted some time after a single vaccine dose is difficult to design. Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the ITP risk associated with live and inactivated vaccines.",

Early research reported that parents were concerned about the efficacy of simultaneous immunisation [26]. However, experimental and clinical epidemiological studies provided a scientific basis for the efficacy of this practice [27]. Recently, the focus of interest in simultaneous vaccination has moved from questions of efficacy to questions of safety [28\u201330]. If a vaccination has adverse reaction risks, these risks may accumulate in simultaneous vaccination [31]. However, no research has compared the risks when administering vaccines simultaneously versus separately in the same population.",

McNemar\u2019s OR is suitable for matched case\u2013control design. Briefly, in this calculation method, vaccination histories for case\u2013control pairs were grouped into four profiles: (1) vaccination ( +) for a patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (case) and vaccination ( +) for a patient with other diseases (control); (2) vaccination ( +) for case and vaccination ( \u2212) for control; (3) vaccination ( \u2212) for case and vaccination ( +) for control; and (4) vaccination ( \u2212) for case and vaccination ( \u2212) for control. In calculating McNemar\u2019s ORs, only two of these profiles (2 and 3) were used based on an assumption of the binary distribution. For example, if the number of the case\u2013control vaccination profile 2 equalled that of profile 3, McNemar\u2019s OR = 1 (null hypothesis) [45]. If the former number of profile 2 doubled the latter number of profile 3, McNemar\u2019s OR = 2. This calculation method originated when McNemar\u2019s OR was developed to evaluate the results of a matched case\u2013control study. Subsequently, conditional logistic regression was developed to further adjust for covariates.",

A Canadian surveillance study (1992\u20132001) identified eight ITP cases after DTP or DTaP \u00b1 IPV \u00b1 Hib vaccinations, three after hepatitis B vaccination and two after influenza vaccination in 12 paediatric hospitals [18]. An Italian post-licensure prospective study involving a large number of older adults conducted from 2006 to 2009 reported 13 cases of ITP after seasonal influenza vaccinations [19]. A study using a Taiwanese national database found an incidence rate ratio for ITP of 1.09 (95% CI 0.65\u20131.85) following pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccination without adjuvant versus non-vaccination among people aged 0\u201342 years, and of 1.05 (95% CI 0.41\u20132.85) among children [20].

Previous research suggests that among Japanese children, the peak age of ITP onset is < 2 years [48]. The ORs for inactivated vaccination could, therefore, be overestimated in this study because most data used for their estimation included data for infants aged < 1 year, who frequently receive inactivated vaccines and have a relatively high incidence of ITP. Therefore, we interpreted the McNemar\u2019s OR of 1.00 (Table 2) and common OR of 0.99 (Table 3) among children aged < 2 years as indicating that this study did not detect ITP risk in inactivated vaccination.",

However, vaccination has three types of benefits: direct effects (immunity of the vaccinated person), indirect effects (herd protection of non-vaccinated people) and reduction in the risk for developing ITP caused by infection with viruses or bacteria. The third type of benefit could be rephrased as the observation that the incidence of ITP following vaccination is lower than the incidence of ITP after infection with wild viruses [50]. The incidence of ITP development in children immunised with MMR is reportedly around one in 30,000, whereas it is approximately one in 3000 following natural rubella infection and approximately one in 6000 following measles infection. Another report suggested that the incidence of ITP caused by MMR vaccination is 10\u201320 times lower than the incidence of ITP following natural infection [6]. As is inherent with a single outcome (in this case, the development of ITP), the present findings of ORs greater than 1 do not consider the third type of vaccination benefit. In other words, it is difficult to investigate the long-term effect of vaccination on preventing ITP development from the perspective of the third type of benefit\u2014if it exists\u2014in cohort or case\u2013control studies.",

The point estimate of the OR was larger than that of single vaccination (1.38 among children aged < 12 years and 1.21 among children aged < 2 years; Table 3) in children of each age group. Few studies have investigated the risks associated with simultaneous vaccination. A randomised controlled trial involving people receiving simultaneous influenza vaccination reported increased haemagglutinin inhibition titre, seroconversion and seropositivity rates, suggesting that the immune response was boosted [57]. Because vaccine efficacy and immune-related adverse reactions have the same origin [15], the rate of ITP development may increase depending on the administration method.

First, the sample size meant the study was underpowered because we adopted a matched design to adjust for several confounders between cases and controls. This sample size also made it difficult to estimate ORs separately by age group. To compensate for this limitation and present additional results, we calculated common ORs using all available data, although adjustment for confounders might have been insufficient for this analysis. Second, we could not adjust for infection history as a confounder. Although we aimed to measure infection history in the questionnaire, we did not obtain sufficient data. Third, because the investigation depended on the voluntary replies of physicians by post, reporting bias might have occurred. Physicians who were interested in potential adverse events might have been more likely to participate in this study, which could have led to an overestimation of the ORs. A national surveillance system of adverse events following vaccinations in Japan is needed in an era when people are concerned about drug-induced diseases. Fourth, each case was matched to one or two controls. This method might have resulted in an imbalance in the weight of samples for the primary outcome.

The use of physician-registered cases enhanced the internal validity of this investigation. This validity would not be possible in a large database study. Second, the data were gathered from hospitals across Japan. The reported ITP risks, therefore, reflect a broad area, suggesting relatively high external validity. Third, the analyses included detailed results stratified by age group and type of vaccine. This information will be informative for researchers and clinicians seeking to assess the potential risks for adverse events for their patients.",
