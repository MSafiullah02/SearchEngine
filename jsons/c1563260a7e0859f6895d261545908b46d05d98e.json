Bats have been recognized as potential reservoirs of novel viruses, with some viruses being regarded as a possible zoonotic threat to humans. In this study, we report the detection and analysis of adenoviruses from different bat species in northern Italy. Upon sequence and phylogenetic analysis, based on a short diagnostic fragment of the highly-conserved DNA polymerase gene, we identified potential novel candidate adenovirus species, including an avian-like adenovirus strain. An adenovirus isolate was obtained in simian cell lines from the carcass of a Pipistrellus kuhlii, and the complete genome sequence was reconstructed using deep sequencing technologies. The virus displayed high nucleotide identity and virtually the same genome organization as the Pipistrellus pipistrellus strain PPV1, isolated in Germany in 2007. Gathering data on epidemiology and the genetic diversity of bat adenoviruses may be helpful to better understand their evolution in the mammalian and avian hosts.",

The genome of adenoviruses is organized in at least 16 clearly defined genus-common genes, including the polymerase, and in a set of more variable genes, genus-specific, mainly located near the ends the genome [3] . Adenoviruses are classified into five genera by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), namely Atadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Ichtadenovirus, Mastadenovirus, and Siadenovirus [4] . The genus, Mastadenovirus, includes adenoviruses that infect only mammals, including humans, causing ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases [5, 6] .",

The mechanisms driving their evolution include the accumulation of punctate mutations, homologous recombination, gene capture, and inter-species transmission [3, 8] . Evolutionary analysis of adenoviruses of African non-human primates has unveiled that human mastadenovirus B (HAdV-B) circulating in humans are of zoonotic origin, suggesting that multiple independent HAdV-B transmission events to humans occurred more than 100,000 years ago [9] . Adenoviruses have long been considered as host specific viruses that co-evolve with their hosts [3, 7] . However, recently, some adenoviruses have been shown to emerge through cross-species transmission, thus highlighting the potential threat of animal-to-animal or animal-to-human circulation of adenoviruses [26] [27] [28] . In this study, we investigated the circulation of BtAdVs in Italy. A BtAdV isolate was obtained from Pipistrellus kuhlii (Kuhl's pipistrelle) and the full-length genome was sequenced.",

The sequences were 99.3% identical to each other at the nucleotide level. The full-length sequence of the adenovirus isolate displayed a genome organization similar to that of the reference PPV1 strain, with an average G + C content of 53.5%, an inverted terminal repeat (ITR) of 205 bp, and 31 predicted genes ( Figure 2) . The three E1 genes (E1A, E1B 19K, and E1B 55K) were present in the Italian isolate ( Figure 2 ). The 16 genus-common core genes, located in the central part of the genome, were conserved [3] .

JN252129), forming a separate cluster and suggesting a potential novel BtAdV species. More interestingly, a BtAdv strain (PA21/16 PS), detected in Pipistrellus spp., rooted tightly with a unique adenovirus found in South American fur seals (SAFS) pups (Arctocephalus australis) in Per\u00f9 (GenBank accession number MF175113), and with avian adenoviruses (genus Aviadenovirus). The SAFS adenovirus was identified during a surveillance study for adenoviruses in breeding colonies of SAFS and Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) in Southern America. In the Southern American study, four mastadenoviruses, four aviadenoviruses and a siadenovirus were detected in SAFSs, whilst three mastadenoviruses, two aviadenoviruses, and three siadenoviruses were identified in Humboldt penguins that shared the same reproductive area in the Peruvian coast [38] . These findings are intriguing, as they indicate the possibility of inter-species transmission between avian and mammalian species and in our study this could have been accounted for by the fact that bats and birds may reach/occupy the same ecological niches (i.e., terminal branches of trees, rocks, or caves) due to their flying abilities. The possibility of a shift between avian and mammalian hosts for adenoviruses is not considered a common event, since adenoviruses are considered highly species-specific [3, 7] . Yet, members of the Atadenovirus genus have been identified in distantly related animal species, including ruminants, poultry, reptiles, and a marsupial [39] . An additional hypothesis is that avian adenovirus DNA may contaminate bat food and that the detected virus was not replicating actively in the animal. Regardless, the resolution of the DNA polymerase region fragment targeted by the consensus PCR is likely not sufficient to discriminate firmly among the adenovirus genera and species and this preliminary piece of evidence should be confirmed by gathering larger, more informative sequences or, possibly, the full-length genome.",
