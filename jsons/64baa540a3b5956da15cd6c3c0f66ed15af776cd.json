ATA, a Salicylic Acid Derivative, With a Myriad of Antiviral Effects ATA (Fig. 1) is a heterogeneous mixture of polymers formed when salicylic acid is treated with formaldehyde, sulfuric acid, and sodium nitrite. 5, 6 ATA is often incorrectly represented as a triphenylmethane dye (Fig. 1 ) rather than as a polymer (Fig. 1 ). 7 While ATA had been known for a long time to interact with a number of enzymes including DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase), aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, ribonucleotide reductase, and ribonucleases (as reviewed by Cushman et al. 7 ), it was considered as a nonspecific enzyme inhibitor, 8 simply because ATA, being a polycarboxylate, would bind by electrostatic interactions to any protein that contains positively charged residues. [The use of ATA as an inhibitor of nucleases during nucleic isolation was advocated at a certain time. 9 ] Interest in ATA revived when it was shown to inhibit the cytopathogenicity of HIV in cell culture. 10, 11 ATA was then shown to specifically interact with CD4, the cell's principal receptor for HIV, as it selectively prevented the binding of OKT4A/Leu-3a monoclonal antibody to the CD4 cell receptor. 12 In further studies, ATA also appeared to block the binding of monoclonal antibody to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120. 13 The lower molecular weight fractions of ATA bound to gp120, but not CD4, and, as they prevented the cytopathicity of HIV-1 and HIV-2, it could be concluded that the ATA fractions bound more avidly to gp120 than to CD4, and that the binding of ATA to gp120 in the absence of CD4 binding was sufficient for anti-HIV activity. 7 After a number of ATA monomer analogues (such as the triphenylcarbinol and triphenylmethane) had proven to be virtually inactive against HIV-1, 14 interest in ATA, as a potential lead compound for the treatment of HIV infections, largely waned.",

In fact, ATA would be able to interfere with various signaling pathways: viz. the ERK pathway, 18 the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, 19 and the insuline-like growth factor 1 signaling pathway. 20 being responsible for anchoring the compound into the cell membrane. Why cholestane was, as such, not further developed for its anti-HIV properties, has remained unclear (to me), but, instead, it opened the way to the ADAM derivatives, as potential NNRTIs, thus joining the wide array of NNRTIs (HEPT, TIBO, nevirapine, BHAP, TSAO, a-APA, etc.) described at that time. 26 The ADAM derivatives were from the very beginning recognized as genuine NNRTIs, as, for example, suggested for 3 0 ,3 00 -dibromo-4 0 ,4 00 -dimethoxy-5 0 ,5 00 -bis(methoxycarbonyl)-1,1-diphenyl-1-heptene (compound 8 in Cushman et al. 27 ; or compound 5 in Cushman et al. 26 ) (Fig. 2) , although structurally little resemblance could be observed between the ''classical'' NNRTIs (HEPT, TIBO, y) and the ADAMs, particularly with regard to the paradigmatic ''butterfly'' structure assigned to NNRTIs such as TBZs. 4 Starting from the original ADAM derivatives, 27 new ''ADAMs'' were derived with optimized potency, 28 exhibiting an EC 50 of 0.013 mM and a selectivity index of 2430 [i.e. methyl-3 0 ,3 00 -dichloro-4 0 ,4 00 -dimethoxy-5,5 00 -bis(methoxycarbonyl)-6,6-diphenylhexenoate]. 29 This potency was even further increased to 0.0013 mM (EC 50 ) and the selectivity increased to 10,000, if the chlorines were replaced by bromines, as in methyl-3 0 ,3 00 -dibromo-4 0 ,4 00 -dimethoxy-5 0 ,5 00 -bis(methoxycarbonyl)-6,6-diphenyl-5-hexenoate (Fig. 2) 30 [solid-phase synthesis of the ADAMs was described by Xu et al. 31 ].",

However, other potential applications of the ADAMs should not be ignored. They may not have much potential as PDE4 inhibitors [phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) belongs to the phosphodiesterase family of hydrolases responsible for regulating cellular cAMP levels, PDE4 playing a role in HIV infections, and PDE4B2 being specifically involved in inflammation], as they have only weak, if any, activity against PDE4B2. 39 However, two distantly related ADAM derivatives, i.e. compounds 15 and 16, 40 like colchicine, proved active as tubulin polymerization inhibitors (IC 50 of 3.7 and 2.8 mM, respectively). This makes them worth pursuing as potential anticancer drug candidates.",

While first demonstrated for L-731988, 48 this proof of principle has been extended to various related compounds, i.e. L-870810 (a naphthyridine carboxamide) 49 and L-870812 50 which proved efficacious in vivo against retroviral (simianhuman immunodeficiency virus) replication in vivo (rhesus macaques).",

It was, therefore, interesting to ascertain whether elvitegravir, being both a ''diketo acid'' and a ''quinolone'' should behave as an INI or transcription inhibitor. Unlike WM-5, but like L-870810, elvitegravir behaved as a genuine INI. 57 Elvitegravir is a more potent INI than raltegravir, 58 but its mechanism of action, i.e. inhibition of the strand transfer function of integrase must be similar, as both drugs exhibited a parallel resistance profile, the Q148 K and T66I mutations conferring the highest resistance to both drugs. 58 In addition to the Q148 K and T66I mutations, a few other mutations, i.e. E92Q, L74 M and S230N have been shown to confer resistance to elvitegravir and, where examined, other INIs (i.e. L-870810 and raltegravir) as well. [59] [60] [61] While, on the one hand, the clinical relevance of these mutations remains to be demonstrated, i.e. with regard to possible reduced fitness of the viral mutants, they should, on the other hand, help in gaining further insight in the mode of action of INIs and, eventually facilitate the design of new INIs. which had been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and cellular stress response. 63 Moreover, LEDGF was found to robustly enhance the strand transfer activity of HIV integrase in vitro, and Cherepanov et al. 63 concluded that LEDGF may constitute a novel target for anti-HIV drug therapy.",

These tantalizing perspectives have not deterred several investigators to launch a search for small molecule PPI inhibitors (already nicknamed as SMPPIIs) 70 or to screen for smallmolecule inhibitors of the HIV integrase-LEDGF/p75 interaction by a luminescent proximity assay. 72 A first (apparent) success has already been reported: that of D77, a benzoic acid derivative (Fig. 4B ) that would function as a novel HIV-1 inhibitor targeting the interaction between the integrase's CCD and the LEDGF's IBD 73 [D77, as shown in Figure 4B , would (principally) interact with the CDD domain of the integrase]. This approach opens a wealth of possibilities, i.e. structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, pharmacokinetics and toxicity, and, particularly, confirmatory studies to validate the presumed target of action and provide the ultimate proof-of-concept.",

Although highly contagious, the ''Mexican'' H1N1 influenza variant has so far not proven more pathogenic than other seasonal influenza A H1N1 variants (although it started its journey in the off-season).

Crystal structure analysis shows that binding of oseltamivir requires a rotation of the Glu276 residue away from the hydrophobic pentyloxy group of oseltamivir, which then makes hydrophobic contact with a methylene group on Glu276 (Panel C). However, binding of either sialic acid (the natural substrate) or zanamivir does not require a change in the position of Glu276. The His274Tyr substitution in the neuraminidase active site pushes the Glu276 further into the binding site and disrupts the hydrophobic pocket that is required only for oseltamivir binding. According to Moscona. 117 collected for oseltamivir, Skehel and colleagues considered it prudent for pandemic stockpiles of oseltamivir to be augmented by additional antiviral drugs including zanamivir. 106 To stockpile oseltamivir (tamiflu) as a precautionary measure against an influenza pandemic is both risky and costly. It is recomforting, therefore, that intensive efforts have been made to improve the synthesis of oseltamivir [the starting material is shikimic acid normally obtained from the Chinese star anise 107 ] and these efforts have indeed allowed a more practical and, at the same time, high-yielding synthesis of oseltamivir. [108] [109] [110] [111] An environmental issue, linked to its chemical stability, is that oseltamivir would not be easily removed or degraded in normal sewage water. 112 This not only points to the stability of the compound, but also its propensity to contribute to far-reaching anti-influenza virus drug resistance.",

Palivizumab has been approved for use in these patients. 135 Children who experience RSV lower respiratory tract infections early in life have high rates of subsequent recurrent wheezing. Palivizumab, by ameliorating or preventing this lower respiratory tract infection in preterm infants may reduce subsequent recurrent wheezing. 136 Wu et al. 137 described the selection of ultra-potent anti-RSV antibodies for preventing RSV infection. They applied an iterative mutagenesis approach, and were able to identify palivizumab Fab variants with up to 1500-fold improvement and palivizumab IgG variants with up to 44-fold improvement in the ability to neutralize RSV. Recently, a new, ultra-potent antibody, motavizumab, has been developed for the prevention of RSV infections. 138 Motavizumab binds to RSV F protein 70-fold better than palivizumab, and it reduced pulmonary RSV titers to up to 100-fold lower levels than did palivizumab.",

JNJ-2408068 is highly potent (EC 50 : 0.16 nM) but according to Douglas, 150 it has limited oral bioavailability. Like VP-14637, JNJ2408068 was found to protect cotton rats from experimental RSV infection. 151 BMS-433771 [1-cyclopropyl-1,3-dihydro-3-[[1-(4-hydroxybutyl)-1H-benzi-midazol-2-yl]methyl]-2H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-2-one] is another example of anti-RSV agents targeted at the F protein. 152 [To confirm that the mechanism of action was through inhibition of fusion, the K394R virus mutant was selected for resistance to BMS-433771 in vitro, and found refractory to BMS-433771 in vivo.] It proved orally efficacious against RSV infection in Balb/C mice and cotton rats. 153, 154 Numerous structural variants of BMS-433771 have been synthesized [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] but, most likely, BMS-433771 still excelled in potency and oral bioavailability.",

            "text": "Following up on the work of Beauchamp et al. on a series of acyclovir derivatives with modifications in the heterocyclic base (which did not yield significantly active compounds), 164 we (Bozenna Golankiewicz, Jerzy Boryski, and I) started a new program around new acyclovir derivatives with one or more nitrogen centers blocked by methylation or incorporated into an additional ring structure. Marked activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2), comparable to that of acyclovir, was obtained with 1-methyl-9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine and 9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-1,N-2-isopropeno-guanine (Fig. 7) , compounds 2 and 5, respectively, in the original publication of Boryski et al. 165 While N-1 methylation allowed the antiviral activity of acyclovir to be preserved, it was virtually abolished following N-3 methylation. 166 The earliest report on 1,N-2-etheno derivatives of guanine has been that of Sattsangi et al. 167 on 1,N-2-ethenoguanosine. 1,N-2-ethenoguanine was not only successfully implemented in acyclovir but also in ganciclovir. The resulting tricyclic analogue of ganciclovir (compound 2b in the original publication) (Fig. 7) proved markedly active not only against HSV-1 and HSV-2, but also varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus 168 Further substitution of the methyl group in the 1,N-2-isopropeno moiety by a phenyl group as in 6-phenyl-TACV (tricyclic acyclovir) and 6-phenyl-TGCV (tricyclic ganciclovir) (Fig. 7) , compounds 7 and 13 in the original publication 169 give rise to fluorescent antiviral compounds which, on the one hand, showed an antiviral activity profile similar to that of their parent compounds (acyclovir and ganciclovir), and, on the other hand, showed relatively strong fluorescence, making them useful for the noninvasive diagnosis of herpesvirus infections. 169 This line of research was then extended to 6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-TACV and 6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-TGCV (compounds 8 and 27 in the original publication) as fluorescent tricyclic analogues of acyclovir and ganciclovir. 170 Yet further extension of the 6-side chain in TACV and TGCV yielded the 6-[4-(phenoxycarbonyloxy)phenyl]substituted derivatives (compounds 11 and 19 in the original publication) 171 (Fig. 7) with, again, combination of high antiherpetic activity and strong fluorescence. Similarly, the 6-(4-biphenylyl)substituted TACV and TGCV derivatives showed high selectivity against HSV-1 together with fluorescent properties. 172 Introduction of a fluorine i.e. in the 6-phenyl part of the structure may make the tricyclic acyclovir and ganciclovir analogues amenable to 19 F NMR studies. 173 Meanwhile the fluorescent tricyclic acyclovir and ganciclovir derivatives had demonstrated a pronounced cytostatic activity (accompanied by a pronounced bystander effect) in HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) gene-transduced tumor cell lines. 174 The importance of this particular observation should be viewed in the context of our earlier observation that tumor cells transformed with the HSV-1 TK gene become highly sensitive to the cytostatic effects of anti-herpetic drugs such as ganciclovir. 175 In 1992 Culver et al. reported that rats bearing glioma tumors could be successfully treated with ganciclovir following in situ transfection by the HSV-1 TK gene. 176 This combined gene/chemotherapy approach for cancer has been further elaborated by Degre`ve et al. 177 The fluorescent tricyclic acyclovir and ganciclovir may well fit in this approach as being fluorescent they could be readily monitored in biological fluids and tissues, and being more lipophilic than acyclovir or ganciclovir themselves they may better taken up from the blood into the central nervous system. 174 Following acyclovir, ganciclovir, the relatively unknown 9-f[cis-1 0 ,2 0 -bis(hydroxymethyl)cycloprop-1 0 -yl]methylgguanine and especially its 1 0 S,2 0 R enantiomer A-5021 served as the starting point for implanting the 1,N-2-etheno bridge. Although A-5021, quite unfortunately, has not been further pursued as an antiviral drug (candidate), its credentials have been known since the late 1990s. [178] [179] [180] [181] I have, personally, always emphasized the potential of A-5021 as an antiviral drug, 182 and, therefore, I favor the use of the scaffold of A-5021 when building it up to tricyclic analogues, reminiscent of the tricyclic derivatives of acyclovir (TACV) and ganciclovir (TGCV) (see supra). The tricyclic analogues of A-5021 reported by Ostrowski et al. 183 confirm the potential of this approach.",

She was (and still is) at the Gause Institute of New Antibiotics of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences at Moscow (Russia). We decided to work on antibiotics, not as antibacterial agents, but as cytostatic agents, and from our original collaboration resulted several papers describing the cytostatic activity of a number of anthracycline (i.e. daunorubicin) derivatives [185] [186] [187] [188] as well as streptonigrin derivatives. 189, 190 [Incidentally, Ferenc Sztaricskai (see infra) was a co-author on the latter paper.] None of these compounds or any of their derivatives was further explored for their antiviral potential; and so was the antibiotic arcyriarubin. 191 Yet, antibiotics belonging to this class of compounds (such as arcyriaflavin) have been reported to exhibit potent and selective inhibition of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication, 192 and bisindolylmaleimides such as arcyriaflavin A (Fig. 8) may even have potential usefulness as anti-hepatitis C virus agents. 193 In the mean time, novel derivatives of the antibiotic olivomycin 194, 195 and novel anthracene-9,10-diones 196 were reported, although they were considered only as cytostatic, and, regretfully, not as (potential) antiviral agents.",

As these compounds had lost their antibacterial activity (i.e. ability to interact with the peptidoglycan glycopeptidyl transferase) they may be expected not to lead to bacterial resistance even after prolonged administration. Glycopeptide aglycon derivatives such as 5a 198 and 62 197 may therefore be considered promising candidate drugs for the chemotherapy and/ or-prophylaxis of HIV infections. Numerous glycopeptide antibiotics, primarily derived from eremomycin and teicoplanin, have been described for their antibacterial activity. [199] [200] [201] [202] [203] [204] [205] As shown earlier with regard to their anti-HIV activity, 197, 198 many of these compounds also showed activity against the coronaviruses feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and human SARS CoV, i.e. compound (Fig. 8) . 206 Although the mode of anti-coronavirus action could, like the anti-HIV-1 mode of action, be attributed to an inhibition of the viral entry process, there was, in general, no close correlation between the EC 50 values of the compounds for HIV-1, FIPV, and SARS CoV. 206 Whether any of the above mentioned glycopeptide aglycon derivatives would have any anti-influenza virus activity is not known (and has probably never been assessed). It therefore came as a surprise that one particular glycopeptide aglycon derivative, namely aglycoristocetin with cyclobutene dione carrying an hydrophobic side chain (Fig. 8) , compound 8e in the original publication, showed a specific, consistent and selective activity (EC 50 : 0.4 mM) against various influenza A and B viruses. 207 Again the mode of action of compound 8e was assumed to be associated with the influenza virus entry process. 207 This signals that (many of) the glycopeptide antibiotic derivatives reported by Maria Peobrazhenskaya and her coworkers should be revisited for their potential anti-influenza virus activity, and, vice versa, the compounds from Ferenc Sztaricskai and his coworkers should also be looked at for their potential activity against HIV and SARS CoV. 209 Here, I address further case reports that have appeared within the past 5-year period on the potential usefulness of cidofovir in the treatment of polyomavirus-associated infections.",

In the treatment of HC after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, cidofovir may even to be instilled directly into the bladder, as this regimen has been shown to decrease BK viral load and significantly improve the clinical outcome. 214 Whether cidofovir, in addition to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), would give an additional benefit, as compared with HAART alone in the treatment of PML in HIVinfected patients could not be proven. 224 The usefulness of cidofovir in the treatment of PML has continued to be controversial since my previous review in 2003. 209 Cidofovir would be helpful in the treatment of PML according to some reports 225, 226 but not according to others. 227 The favorable response of PML, as visualized by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, to treatment with cidofovir (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) in combination with cytarabine (2 mg/kg/day for 5 days every 3 weeks) is illustrated in Figure 9 .

LEDGF as Cellular Cofactor for HIV Integrase: An Attractive Target for anti-HIV Drug Design?The LEDGF ''story'' started in 2000, when Peter Cherepanov and his coworkers 62 demonstrated that using a synthetic gene, efficient expression of HIV-1 integrase was achieved in human cells. Cherepanov et al. then found in the nuclei of human cells stably expressing the HIV integrase that it formed stable tetramers associated with the LEDGF/p75, a protein",
