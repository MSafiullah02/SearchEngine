            "text": "T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cell is a recently discovered T regulatory (Treg) cell subset with critical roles in regulating germinal center responses and modulating the immune environment in the lymph nodes [1]. Tfr cells present features of both T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and Treg cells, including CXCR5, PD-1, ICOS, CTLA-4, and Foxp3 expression [2]. Currently, it is thought that Tfr cells differentiate from Treg cells that gain access to the B cell follicles in the spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer\u2019s patches [1, 2]. Following interaction with cognate B cells in the germinal center and the B cell follicles, these Treg cells gain fully differentiated Tfr phenotype with PD-1 and ICOS expression, and may stay in the B cell zones, exit the lymphoid tissues and enter circulation, or infiltrate the peripheral tissues [3, 4]. Representing approximately 1% of the total CD4+ T cells, and 6% of total Treg cells in draining lymph nodes, Tfr cells are a small but critical population in the development of antibody responses. In mice, Tfr cell depletion resulted in elevated numbers of GC B cells, antigen-specific B cells, and plasma cells, and increased serum antibody titer [2, 5, 6]. Sorted human Tfr cells (CD4+CXCR5+CD25+CD127\u2212 T cells) were shown to suppress antibody production in vitro [7]. Mechanistically, Tfr cells can suppress Tfh cell expansion and cytokine production in a CTLA-4-dependent fashion [8]. Interestingly, CTLA-4-deleted Tfr cells promoted the production of low-affinity antibodies [8], suggesting that Tfr cells likely improved the quality of the antibody response by preventing overactive Tfh-mediated antibody secretion. Recently, studies demonstrated that Tfr cells were dynamically regulated in acute and chronic virus infections. During influenza infection or LCMV infection, Tfr cells in the lymphoid organs presented a drop in frequency, and it is possible that this drop was required for the generation of virus-specific antibodies [1]. In contrast, Tfr frequency appeared to increase in chronic HIV infections, as well as in chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients [9, 10]. The frequency and function of Tfr cells in other settings have not been extensively investigated.",

Despite years of research, ARDS remains a life-threatening condition with only palliative treatments available [12]. Activation of effector immune cells and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines are found in the lung of ARDS patients, both of which can increase alveolar membrane permeability and coagulation in a perpetuating positive feedback loop [13]. On the other hand, Treg cells in humans and murine acute lung injury (ALI) models can disrupt the proinflammatory process, reduce disease severity, promote injury resolution, and accelerate healing [14\u201317]. In addition, we previously showed that early recruitment of IL-10-producing Breg cells and elevated IL-10 secretion could suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines and predicted better survival in ARDS patients [18, 19]. The role of Tfr cells, on the other hand, has not been elucidated in ARDS patients.",

The frequency of Treg cells and Tfr cells was examined in the mini-BAL samples by flow cytometry (Fig. 2a). First, we observed that the Foxp3 expression level in mini-BAL samples was not significantly different between Tfr cells and non-Tfr Treg cells (Fig. 2b). Also, the Foxp3 expression by Tfr cells from the PBMCs was not significantly different from the Foxp3 expression by Tfr cells from mini-BAL samples (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). In most ARDS subjects, the frequencies of Treg and Tfr cells presented an increasing trend (Fig. 2c).

We sorted Tfr cells as CD4+CD25+CXCR5+ T cells, and non-Tfr Treg cells as CD4+CD25+CXCR5\u2212 T cells from PBMCs of healthy controls ARDS patients, and ARDS mini-BAL samples were sorted using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The cells were then lysed for the collection of mRNA. The expression levels of CTLA-4, IL-10, and TGF-\u03b2 were analyzed by RT-PCR. The expression of CTLA-4 in non-Tfr Treg cells and Tfr cells from ARDS PBMCs and ARDS mini-BAL was significantly higher than the expression of CTLA-4 in non-Tfr Treg cells and Tfr cells from healthy control PBMCs (Fig. 3b). The CTLA-4 expression in non-Tfr Treg cells and Tfr cells from ARDS mini-BAL was further increased compared to the CTLA-4 expression in non-Tfr Treg cells and Tfr cells from ARDS PBMCs. Tfr cells from ARDS mini-BAL presented lower CTLA-4 expression than non-Tfr Treg cells.

Three major discoveries were made: first, both the Treg cells and the Tfr cells were significantly enriched in ARDS patients compared to in healthy controls; second, compared to the non-Tfr Treg cells, the Tfr cells were slightly less effective in some, but not all, aspects of suppression; and third, compared to non-Tfr Treg cells, the Tfr cells were more effective at promoting IL-10 expression in B cells.

Hence, the functional difference between non-Tfr Treg cells and Tfr cells may become critical in the determination of disease outcome. A number of mysteries remain. First, since there was no mini-BAL sample from controls, it is yet unclear whether Tfr cells also infiltrate healthy lungs. Second, Tfr frequency in mice increased significantly in the lung draining lymph nodes and in blood following influenza infection, which was another disease that involved significant inflammation in the respiratory tract and the lung [3].

Possibly, the common CXCR5 expression by Tfr cells and B cells allowed both to localize close to each other, thus increasing interaction. Whether Tfr cells may represent a specialized Breg-helper cell type requires further investigation. Of note, the experiments were performed in vitro, where Tfr cells, non-Tfr Treg cells and B cells were placed in the same tissue culture. In vivo, the requirement for common CXCR5 expression might be much higher for colocalization of T cells and B cells to occur. In chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients, the frequencies of IL-10+ Breg cells and Tfr cells were both upregulated [10].
