The VAP-1 molecule induced in .skin diseases is identical in size to that found in tonsil HEV and is also modified with abundant sialic acid residues. VAP-1 in inflamed skin is functional since inhibition with an anti-VAP-l mAh IB2 causes a 70% reduction in lymphocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium.

            "text": "Measles remains to be one of the most important child health problem in developing countries. Studies of protective immune responses and identification of relevant B-and T-cell epitopes are required for a better understanding of immunity to measles. We have established techniques to measure antigen specific T-cell responses in whole-blood cultures from capillary specimens. These techniques were used to study proliferation and TH1/TH2 heterogeneity in response to various measles antigens when stimulating lymphocytes from immune adult donor's or from children before and after vaccination. Separated lymphocytes from adult immune donors proliferated in response to crude measles antigen, i.e. Complement Fixation Antigen (CFA), but not to control antigen. However such response was not detected when stimulating whole-blood cell cultures obtained from vaccinated children. T-cell activation can be manifested by cytokine secretion rather than proliferation, we therefore measured IFN-7 in supernatants from cell-cultures stimulated with CFA. Increased, dose dependent, IFN-y production was detected by ELISA in cultures with separated lymphocytes from adult immune donors, as compared to control antigen and medium alone. Whole-blood cultures from vaccinated children are presently being examined in the same way. We are currently refining the technique for detection of low amounts of IL-4. Fetal Antigen 1 (FAl) was first described by Fay et aL 1988 Eur.J.Obstet.Gynecol.Repro.Biol. 29, 73-85 , and has recently been characterized with respect to primary structure and glycosylation by Jen. sen etal, 1994 Eur.J.BioI.Chem. 225. 85-92. In the context of diabetes there are striking similarities between human FAl and the 38 kDa insulin secretory granule protein isolated from the rat (Roep etal, 1990 Nature 345, 632-634) with respect lo Mr and the tissue expression. The 38 kDa has been described as a major autoantigen in IDDM. We have established a murine animal model for the study of the biological significansof FAl including: (i) purification of mFAl, (ii) production of antibodies, (iii) immunohistochemical location studies, (iv) establishment of ELISA technique.",

Iscoms and its matrix have been reported to induce the production of cellbound and secreted IL-1. Purified components of Quitlaja extracts have been used to develop novel adjuvant fomiulations based on iscoms. We studied the capacity of four new matfix formulations to stimulate production of IL-1 ifi an in wYro system. Murine peritoneal cells were cultured with various concentrations of the matrixes and the supernatants were tested for IL-1a by immunoassay. The most efficient fofmulation was 7.0.3. The influence of the physical conformation of the adjuvant on the capacity to stimulate APC was evaluated by the production of IL-1 mediated by 7.0.3 either in iscom form (containing influenza antigens), or in matrix form or as free component. Iscom was the most efficient form. The matrix and free components also stimulated IL-1 secretion but at lower level and highef concentrations were required. The in vitro results were confirmed by in wVo experiments. A significant pfopoftion of IL-1a+ splenocytes were detected by FACS in mice following treatment with iscoms. CD30 is a 120 kDa surface antigen expressed by Reed Stemberg cells of Hodgkin s disease, as well as by activated B and T lymphocytes. The immunologic function of CD30 is not yet determined It is known, however, that 85 % of the CD30+ T cells co-express the T-iielper (Th) marker CD4 To investigate whether CD30 defines a subtype of T helper cells, seven Pifyrosporum orbiculare specific CD4+ T cell clones from a patient with atopic dermatitis were assessed for CD30 surface and gene expression. The clones were activated with 0KT3 (anti-CD3 antibodies) and defined as Thl {n=2), ThO (n=2), and Th2 (n=3), according to their cytokine mRNA production detected by RT-PCR 0KT3 activation induced CD30 expression on more than 85% of the cells in all clones within one day as measured with tlow cytometry using fluorescein-conjugated anti-CD30 (Ber-H2, Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) . A difference between the clones was noted in that the Th2 clones remained highly positive in CD30 reactivity whereas the other clones started to decline from day 3 Fourteen days after stimulation the Th2 clones expressed CD30 on 69 % of the cells, Ihe ThO clones on 15 % and the Thl clones on 6 % of the cells. Still, 24 day5 after stimulation, we determined approximately 40 % CD30+ cells among the Th2 clones but only 5% or less in the ThO and Thl clones The gene expression for CD30 as detected by RT-PCR correlated well to the cell surface expression of CD30. These data indicate that CD30 identifies activated CD4+ T cells and is sustained expressed in Th2 cells-CA^* MOBIUZATION tN PHYSIOLOGICALLY STIMULATED SINGLE T CELI5 CORRELATES WITH T CELL RECEPTOR SURFACE EXPRESSION. E. Blichfeldt, L.A. Munthe. J.S. R0tnes, B. Bogen. University of Oslo, Norway. Fax: +47 2285 1209. We have investigated the relationship between TcR expression and * signaling. Intracellular free Ca^* concentration li) was monitored, by use of an imaging system, in single Fura-2 loaded CD4* T cells stimulated with their physiological ligand, i.e. antigenic peptide bound to MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells. 6 Thl clones derived from mice transgenic for the a^ TcR {Vol. Jal9; Vp8.2, D9I, J0L2) of the CD4* BALB/c T cell clone 4B2A1 were used. The specificity of the transgenic receptor is towards the 91-101 fragment of the MOPC315 Xl L-chain. presented on the MHC class III-E** molecule. The different Thl clones express varying levels of the transgenic TcR as detected by staining with the clonotype-specific mAbGBIB. Such nonhomogenousexpression of tbe transgenic TcR among the clones is due to endogenously rearranged TcR genes; i.e., most of the clones express two distinct TcR's. The relative intensity of staining of the Tbl clones varied from 56 % (3G11, a clone also expressing TcR V^S) to 100 %. compared 10 4B2A1 (the donator clone of the transgenes, expressing only one receptor). Both the maximum and mean [Ca^*]i increase evoked in the various cloned T cells by 91-101(>.2\"')pulsed, I-E'* expressing L cell fibroblasts correlated linearly with the relative intensity of GB113 staining. This indicates that quantitative differences in TcR levels may be an important factor in T cell activation. After preparing and characterizing dextran-cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) conjugates, we studied their immunogenicity in mice following systemic or mucosal immunizations Dextrans of different molecular weights were conjugated via adipic acid hydrazide and N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyritiyldithio) propionate (SPDP) to CTB Intranasal immunizations with conjugates evoked local IgA antibody responses against dextran in the lung and perora! immunizations did the same in the small intestine. Intranasal immunizations also elicited serum antibody titers that were significantly higher or equal to those afler subcutaneous immunizations. The antibody responses were dose-dependent. We have also studied the effect of preexisting antibodies to CTB on the magnitude of the anti-dextran response The results show that it is possible to evoke a local as well as systemic antibody response against a polysaccharide by conjugating it to CTB and using an appropriate route of immunization.

Methods: Healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were inoculated i.v. with 5 superantigen producing 5. aureus strains and one nonsuperantigen producing 5. aureus control strain. The animals were assessed with regard to clinical course, and serum levels of lL-6, immunoglobulins and rheumatoid factors (Exp I). Rats inoculated with S. aureus AB-1 producing staphylococcal enterotoxin A were further analyzed by the use of histopathology and immunohistochemistry <Exp II). Furthermore, the clinical course was assessed in rats treated with anti-TCR monoclonal antibody R73 in connection with inoculation with S. aureus AB-1 (Exp 111). Results: Superantigen producing S. aureus strains induced arthritis in almost all rats. wherea.s the non-superantigen producing control strain only induced mild transient arthritis in 20% of rats. Semm IL-6 levels increased significantly in rats inoculated with superantigen producing S. aureus. In contrast, irrespective of staphylococcal strain used, there was similar polyclonal B cell activation. Histopathology showed erosive arthritis in a majority of tats within 11 days. Staining of arthritic joints revealed that 12% of infiltrating cells were CD4+ cells, many of which were activated. Blocking of the TCR led to a milder course of arthritis. Conclusions: Polyclonal B cell activation does not seem to correlate to neither arthritis nor superantigen production. Bacterial superantigen production is a virulence factor in septic arthritis probably through stimulation of T cells. T lymphocytes actively participate in the development of arthritic lesions.",

Brockdorff, J,, Nielsen, M., ''Svejgaard, A,, Oduin, N. from The Ceil Cybernetics Laboratory, University of Copenhagen Fax:+45 35327851 and \u00a7Tissue Typing Laboratory, State University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. Besides its function as a growth factor for T lymphocytes, interleukin-2 {IL-2) induces LFA-1 mediated adhesion, migration, and extravasation of T lymphocytes, it is, however, largely unknown, how IL-2 receptors {1L-2R) are coupled to the LFA-1 adhesion pathway. Here, we show that calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases PP1/2A, strongly inhibited IL-2 induced proliferation and homotypic aggregation in CD4 T cells In contrast, ligand induced down regulation of IL-2 receptors was not inhibited In in vitro assays, calyculin A inhibited PP1/2A-mediated dephosphorylation of phosphoryiase A, a physiological substrate for PFI/PP2A phosphatases Likewise, in vivo pretreatment with calyculm A mhibited PP1/PP2A phosphatase activity by aproximately 70 %. Inhibitors of other protein phosphatases, such as cyclosporm A, had no effect on IL-2 induced homotypic adhesion or proliferating In contrast, cyclosporm A almost compleately blocked CD3 mediated proliferation m parallel experiments In conclusion, we provide evidence that protein phosphatases PP2I/PP2A play a critical role in IL-2 induced, LFA-1 dependent adhesion The amino acid structure of RF produced in healthy immunized donors, patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and patients with lympho-proliferative diseases were compared. Of 13 RF all using the DP-10 VH and Kv325 VL germline gene the usually extremely diverse CDRH3 regions show a remarkable restriction in length and sequence. Two pairs of RF have a particularly high homology in this region. The CDRH3S of RF-MR1 from a healthy immunized donor and Bor, a mixed cryoglobulinemia RF, have only two amino acid differences. Further, the CDRn3s of two sets of clonally related RF, one found in a patient with RA and one found in a healthy immunized donor have only three amino acid differences from each other. Even more restriction was seen in the CDRH3 in three RFs, one from each of these three conditions, using another heavy chain germline gene, DP-54. The homologies seen in the V regions of these RF in both health and disease, suggests that they have been selected against a very similar, if not identical epitope at some stage in B cell development. In the present study, the V8 and VY segment usage of-yB T cells in PB and ainong intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) of non-inflamed and inflamed intestine of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was analyzed. Cell surface expression of the protein and gene transcription was assayed by using flow cytometry using a panel of V gene subtype specific mAb and PCR analysis using V gene specific primers. The T6 T cell receptor (TCR) expressing cells were increased in PB of patients with Crohn's disease (CrD), but not in patients with ulcerative colitis (UlC). In patients with IJIC, higher frequency of ^5 T cells was found in the non-inflamed than in the inflamed intestine. In IBD patients, the V51 subset was clearly dominant among i^ T cells in the intestine both as analyzed by flow cytometry and by PCR analysis. A major fraction of ^6 T cells expressed VY8, but a significant fraction was stained also with mAb directed against Vyl, VY3 and Vy^ products. In normal PB the V78 subset was a minor subset only expressed on approximately 5 % of the 75 T cells, whereas in PB of IBD patients the VY8 subset was highly increased and constituted around 25 % of all 76 T cells. Furthermore, the V51 subset was highly increased in PB of IBD patients. These results indicate that there is an expansion of i6T cells in PB of IBD patients which resemble the dominant \"gut-like\" phenotype. Interestingly, we found some patients with acute IBD of short disease duration, who had an extremely large proportion of ^5 T cells in PB expressing two distinct Vy proteins on the cell surface.",

            "text": "In vitro secretion of Interleukin-4 and Interferon-7 in response to specific allergens in peripheral mononuclear cells frotn atopic and non-atopic individuals. CD4+ T cells can be divided into two major subsets, T helper (Th)l and Th2 cells. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is produced by Th2 cells and Induces switching to Immunoglobulin E which induces histamine release from mast cells in allergy. Interferon-y (IFN-y) produced by Thl cells counteracts the effects of iL-4. In this study we wanted to investigate whether the elevated specific IgE-Ievels in allergic patients were reflected by an increased number of IL-4 producing cells in response to allergens. The number of IL-4 and IFN-y producing cells (ELISPOT) in response to specific allergens (birch polleji and hair from cat) in peripheral mononuclear cells from atopic and healthy individuals were compared. In the atopic donors there was an increase in the number of IL-4 producing cells in response to specific antigen as compared to healthy donors (p<0.(101). When the allergen was combined with a suboptimal dose of PHA, there was a synergized increase in the number of IL-4 producing cells in the atopic donors, which was not seen with the number of IFN-y producing cells. In conclusion, these data indicate that the elevated IgE levels in atopies are reflected by an increased number of allergen specific IL-4 producing cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the immune response in rats orally fed ovalbumin (OVA) compared to control rats fed a normal diet after immunization with OVA and an orally challenge with a bacterium producing OVA. Rats were made partially tolerant by feeding an OVA-containing diet from weaning for one to four consecutive weeks. Controls were weaned onto a standard diet without OVA. One week after ending OVA feeding, the animals were immunized with a mixture of OVA and human serum albumin (HSA) in Freiind 's complete adjuvant (FCA) ai one site of the back. Blood was collected two weeks later and the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response was evaluated by challenging the rats with OVA and HSA in the ears. Five days thereafter the animals were ihen orally challenged by colonizing wiih an Escherichia coli producing OVA. All rats fed OVA showed a significantly suppressed DTH response to OVA compared to the rats fed standard diet. Funhermore only lhe rats fed OVA. showed bystander tolerance i.e. had a significantly lower DTH response to HSA than the controls fed a normal diet. Immunohistochemistry of sections from the intestine showed a significantly higher IL-2 receptor expression, mainly in goblet cells and greater MHC class II expression both in the villous core and epithelium in the controls than in lhe rats fed OVA. Results from the present study showed that rats partially tolerant to one antigen can show a suppressed T-ccU response to an unrelated antigen given simultaneously. This also leads to a reduced local inflammatory response when colonized with a bacterium producing OVA. Efficient production of protective anti malaria antibodies requires an intact and functional T-cells system. In mice, regulatory CD4+ T-cells can be divided into two functionally distinct subpopulations denoted THI and TH2 cells based on the cytokine profiles they produce. In human, recent studies also suggested functional lieteiogeneity of CD4+T-cells. THI cells produce IL-2 and IFN-Y and TH2 cells produce IL 4. lL-5 and IL-13. THI cells mediate DTH and aie involved in inflammatory reactions, while TH2 cells regulate specific antibody production. We have reported earlier that, in individual donors. iL-4 secretion was not associated with either proliferation or IFN-y production, but was well correlated with elevated concentrations of serum anti-malaria antibodies (IgG) to the same peptides u.sed for T-cell activation. Since IL-4 is an important factor involved in immunoglobulin class switching from IgM/IgG to IgE. it was of interest to study the role of IL-4 in the regulation of anti-malaria IgE production. For this purpose, two groups of donors were selected. One with high and the other with low serum anti-malaria IgE antibody levels. Cells from the donor group with high serum anti-malaria IgE antibodies produced significantly higher IL-4 in response to a recombinant P155/RESA and a crude P.falciparum extract. Similarly individuals from this group had a higher potential to produce IL 4. The levels of serum anti-malaria IgE antibodies were well conelatcd with the capacity of cells to produce IL-4. These findings suggest a regulatory role of IL-4 in the production of anti-malalia IgE antibodies. The role and biological significance of these antibodies in malaria are presently under investigation. The enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was used to enumerate the number of IFN-y and IL-4 producing cells after in vitro stimulation with the malaria antigen Pfl55/RESA or synthetic peptides corresponding to its major T-cell epitopes. Two groups of naturally primed individuals living in rural areas of Burkina Faso were studied. The donors comprised one group of healthy (non-parasitemic) mainly adult people and one parasitemic mainly younger people. IL-4 producing cells were detected in response to PHA but no such cells were detected in response to the malarial antigens. The most frequent IFN-y responses were seen with Pfl55/RESA. Thus, after stimulation with this antigen 52% of the donors responded positively in the ELISPOT assay, while only 27% responded to the synthetic peptides, suggesting that the r-Pfl55/RESA contained T-cell epitopes not covered by the peptides used in this study.The number of IFN-Y producing cells in response to the malarial antigens did not differ between the two groups. However, IFN-y levels found in sera from the parasitemic individuals were significantly higher than in those from healthy donors. This latter finding and the lack of differences seen in the number of IFN-7 producing spots in the two groups indicate that IFN-Y producing cells may have sequestered to other organs in the parasitemic group. Collagen-induced arthritis{CIA) is an experimental model for Rheumatoid Arthritis. In the DA rat it is induced with rat collagen type II(CII) which gives a chronic disease dependent on both B-and T-cells.The aim of this study was to investigate the antibody reactivities and the cellular picture in the synovial flutd(SF) and compare them with RA data. CIA was induced in DA rats by intradermal injections of Cll. At the peak of disease, SF was withdrawn and synovial tissue(ST) dissected. ST sections and SF cell smears were stained, and SF was tested in ELISA for antibodies to Cll and to heat shock protein(Hsp). In addition, we investigated the presence of Rheumatoid factors(RF) and gamma interferon(g-INF). The major cell population in SF was granulocytes, but plasma cells and lymphocytes could be detected. High anti-CII-and RF-ievels were observed both in the SF and systemically. Notably. RF levels were also increased in normal DA rats. A moderate increase in anti-Hsp antibody levels were recorded in arthritis both in SF and systemically. No detectable levels of g-INF were seen in SF. In conclusion, the appearance of cells in the SF is similar in CIA in rats and in human RA. The antibody production data indicate an unusually high production of RF in the arthritis-prone DA rat, but gives no support for a strong production in SF of anti-Hsp or anti-Cll antibodies. No detectable levels of g-INF were recorded in SF. The murine dendritic cell line D2SC/!, immortalized with relrovirus, was stimulated by the viruses Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Sendai virus (SV) and the bacteria E. coli and S. aureus Cowan I (SAC). All induced production of IFN-a and -3 in the D 2SC/1 cells, determined at 24 h by immunoassays. IFN-p levels were usually higher than IFN-a level.s. The HSV was clearly the most efficient inducer. Precultivation of D2SC/1 cells with mGM-CSF (24 h) and mlFN-jJ (2 h) markedly enhanced IFN-a/p production, except for SV. The latter inducer therefore uses another mechanism than e.g. HSV. Cells containing IFN-a and -|i mRNA at 6 h were identified by in situ hybridization with 35Slabelled cRNA probes. Most cells showed a relatively low and uniform IFN-a/p mRNA expression, but infrequent cells (<l/1000) had a very high IFN-a/p mRNA expression. Priming with GM-CSF and IFN-p increased IFN-o/p mRNA levels. The pattern of IFN-a/p responses in D2SC/1 cells resembles that of human and porcine Natural Interferon-a/p Producing (NIP) cells, which have many characteristics of dendritic cells. The fact that they both produce IFN-a/p when exposed to microorganisms further indicates a function of these cytokines early in immune responses. The D2SC/I cells also offer unique possibilites to study tbe regulation of IFN-a/p responses. The bacterial superantigen Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) is a highly potent activator of cytotoxic T cells when presented on MHC class II molecules of target cells. Our earlier .studies showed that such SEA-directed T cells efficiently killed chronic B-lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. With the ultimate goal to replace the natural specificity of SEA for MHC class il molecules with the specificity of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), we initially made a mutated protein A-SEA (PA-SEAm) fusion protein with > 100-fold reduced binding affinity for MHC class II compared to native SEA. The fusion protein was successfully used to direct T cells to B-CLL cells coated with different B lineage specific (CDI9. 20) or associated (CD37. 40) mAbs. The PA-SEAm protein was lO-IOO-fold more potent against mAb coated compared to uncoated HLA class Il-t-B-CLL cells. No correlation was seen between the amount of mAb bound to the cell surface and sensitivity to lysis. Preactivation of B-CLL ceils by phorbol ester increased their sensitivity, and lysis was dependent on ICAM-1 molecules. However, no preactivation of the target cells was needed when a cocktail of 2 or 4 mAbs was used. Circulating leukemia and spleen cells were equally well killed. We conclude that tbe natural target specificity of SEA -MHC class IIcan be reduced by mutagenesis and novel binding specificity can be introduced by linkage to tumor reactive mAbs. Our findings encourage the construction of recombinant SEA mutant fusion proteins for specific T cell therapy of hematopoetic tumors such as B-CLL. CRP is the prototypic aciJte-phase serum protein in man. Biological effects of CRP include its interactions with wide ligands spectrum including phosphorilcholine containing molecules, some sera proteins, nuclear material and so on. We have found that IgG immobilized on the solid phase binds soluble hiiman CKV. The binding of CRP by IgG was relatively sensitive to ionic concentration, being maximal at physiological NaCl concentrations and low pH and was calcium-independent. Dissociation constant of this interaction was about 5,910\"^ M. The interaction depended slightly on IgG subclasses and IgG species. The immune complexes ofrabbit IgG antibodies to numan albumin with this antigen immobilized on the solid phase also bound CRP. It is possible tbat all or most of the CRP-binding capacity was localized on Fc-fragment of IgG. That is confirmed by the following facts: 1) (Fab')2 fragments bound CRP very slightly; and 2) interaction of IgG antibodies to albumin with this antigen was not inhibited by CRP. From the other hatij soluble aggregated IgG inhibited binding CRP with solid phase immobilized IgG. Also CRP changed complement activation ability of aggregated IgG. It possible that CRP may be involved into immune complexes formation via IgG and change the immune complex methabolism.",

DSS was administered in the drinking water to specific pathogen free CD-1(BR), CD-1 (BR) nu/nu and CB-17 SCID mice. The mice were killed after 7 days and their intestines were cut out. Colon length and fecal water content were recorded and the colon was cut into small pieces and placed in 2% saponin buffer for extraction of cytokines. The cytokine content in the extract was measured using ELISA methods specific for IFN-y, IL-6 and TNF-a. Colitis in euthymic and athymic animals, presented as shorteriing of the colon and diarrhea, was associated with elevated levels of IL-6 and to some extent IFN-y and TNF-a in colon tissue.

We have used two different expression systems for the production of an 80 aminoacid sequence from the C-terminus of the Flasmidium falciparum blood stage antigen Ffl55/RESA in an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium Aro A vaccine .strain. Upon expression, the malarial sequence is targeted either to the periplasm as a soluble fusion protein containing two igG-binding domains from the staphylococcal protein A (ZZ) or to the bacterial surface, inserted into the outer membratic protein A (OMPA) derived from Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae. Both ZZM3 and 0MPAM3 were stably expressed in the periplasm or on the surface of Salmonella respectively, but the ZZ expression system yielded 100 times more malarial immunogen than the OMPA system. Live recombinant Salmonella expressing ZZM3 or 0MPAM3 were used to immunize mice. The ZZM3 hybrid induced antibodies to M3, ZZ and to Pfl55/RESA whereas, 0MPAM3 induced similar levels of antibodies reactive to M3 but not to Pfl55; neveitheless, both recombinants induced a memory response to M3 and lo Pfl55/RESA. The high levels of M3 produced by the ZZ system make it suitable for the expression of heterologous antigens in Salmonella. However, in spite of the quantitative difference in M3 expression, both the ZZ and OMPA carriers provided comparable immunogenicity to M3. indicating that the display of M3 on the surface of Salmonella is equally efficient in priming the immune system as is periplasmic targeting. IgE antibodies are able to enhance the specific antibody response in mice via the low affinity receptor for IgE (CD23). B cells and foliicular dendritc cells (FDC) are the only murine cell types expressing CD23, and one of the suggested modes of action of IgE/CD23 is to increase the ability of B cells to present antigen to T cells. Another possibility is that FDC capture the IgE/antigen-complcxes and present these directly to B cells. One approach trying to differentiate between these two cell types is to make use of the MHC restriction of the IgE-mediated enhancement. Mouse strains with the H-2b haplotype are nonresponders in this system, wliereas H-2''.M-k.s.p are responders.",

CD8+ ap IEL dominated in jejunum while cells with the unusual T cell phenotype, CD4-CD8'TCRap+, constituted a major population of colonic lEL. CD4\"*\" aP IEL were equally represented as a minor population, at all three levels of the gut. These data suggest that y8 IEL are involved in surveillance of the epithelial cells whereas ap IEL may participate in immune responses to luminal antigens.",

Furthennore. expression of recombinase activating gene-1 (RAG-1) mRNA was detected in jejunal but not in colonic IEL as determined by RT-PCR. RAG-1 expression was confined to jejunal IEL with immature phenotypes (CD2\"*'TCR/CD3' and CD3'*\"/rCR\" IEL). This strongly suggests that human small intestinal epithelium is a site for extrathymic T cell maturation. Recent reports have suggested interleukin-4 (IL-4) as a selective inducer of VCAM-! on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). VCAM-1 is an endothelial ligand for VLA-4 (CD29CD49d) expressed on lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils but not on neutrophils. IL-4 could thus serve to recruit selectively VLA-4-expressing leukocytes into areas of inflammation without attracting neutrophils. In a new culture system for human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC, in press. Gut) we arrive at a different conclusion. Protein expression was examined by cell-ELISA and flow cytometry. mRNA was examined by reverse transcription-PCR. Adhesion of leukocytes was measured in an fluorescence based multiwell assay (Calcein-AM). VCAM-1 was upregulated in a dosedependent fashion on HIMEC after stimulation with LPS (0-1 f4g/m\\). IL-lp or TNF-a (both 0-1000 U/ml) and displayed characteristic time kinetics similar to HUVEC. IL-4 (0-1000 U/ml) on the other hand appeared lo exert only a negligible stimulatory effect on HIMEC compared with HUVEC. However, IL-4 induced raised mRNA levels compared with unstimulated controls. Adhesion studies were performed to evaluate the functional implications of these findings. Our data show that IL-4 is not able to induce VCAM-1 selectively in HIMEC. Preferential recruitment of mononuclear cells to the gut may thus be mediated by other hitherto unknown mechanisms. The role of infected monocytes in measles pathogenesis i. *; still poorly understood. We studied measles virus (MV) infection in cells of the human myelold lineage with different matunilion stages, from human bone marrow granulocyte/macrophage progenitors to macrophages. MV was able to infect myeloid progenitors CFU-GM (granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units), monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophngcs. MV infection in granulocyte-macrophage colonies of progenitor ccll.s was productive, unlike in monocytes and macrophages. which supported virus RNA and protein .synthesis without releasing infectious virus. Stimulation of infected monocytes by inlerleukin-3 and/or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor was not sufficient to change a restricted infection to a productive one. Maturation of infected monocytes to macrophages did not enhance measles virus production either. In contrast to the results obtained with monocytic cells, human promyelocytic and promonocytic cell lines HL-60, U-937 and THP-1. each of which represents a different stage of maturation, supported virus replication, and TPA (12-0tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate) -induced maturation of the cells to the macrophage-Uke did not markedly alter virus replication.

This nonresponsive phenotype is recessive because it is lost when the animal is crossed with a responder strain.

However, it is still not known how mercury ions primarily activate the immune system Previous studies tTom our lab have shown that in vitro mercuric chloride induce a high proliferative immune response in mercurysusceptible mice, i e A.SW and Balb/c mice, in which both CD4' and CDS' T cells were activated, while in resistant mice as DBA/2 mice, a low proliferative response was induced and only CD8* T cell were activated. We expanded the studies and found mercuric chloride induced a high proliferative response in other mercury-susceptible mice like SJL mice (high responder). and always a very low response in resistant mice like A/J mice or CBA mice (low-responder). After culturing spleen cells from low-responder mice with mercury for certain period of time, we washed the mercury away and the recovered cells were incubated for one day or two days more. We found that a high proiiferative response was restored in these low-responder mice, i e. DBA/2, A/J and CBA mice The restored proliferative response was higher in DBA/2 than CBA and A/J mice The phenotype analysis showed that in the restored response both CD4' and CD8^ T cells from low-responder mice were activated to proliferate. Our results suggest that in vitro spleen lymphocytes from both in vivo mercury-susceptible and resistant mice have the potential to respond to the mercury primarily. Acute P. falciparum is associated with a pronounced reduction in the ability of peripheral T cells to respond to antigenic stimulation in vitro, while the mechanism behind this T-cell dysfunction is not fully understood. One possible cause is in vitro production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, previously implicated in peripheral T-cell non-responsiveness in acute visceral leishmaniasis. In the present study we have examined the role of IL-10 in malaria induced T-cell non-respon^ivetiess. Our preliminary results indicate that: L In vitro proliferation can nol be restored by addition of a blocking monoclonal antibody to IL-10. 2. No inverse relation between IL-10 production and proliferation in vitro can be detected. 3. Significant reduction of in vitro lymphoproliferation of healthy T cells requires tnuch higher levels of IL-10 than those measured in patient T-cell supernatants. These results indicate that the well-established in vitro nonresponsiveness of peripheral T cells from acute P. falciparum malaria patients is unlikely to be due to IL-10 produced in vitro. Results of these and further experiments oti the mechanisms in malaria-induced T-cell noti-responsiveness will be discussed. Psoriasis vulgaris has HLA associations. We have previously defined certain HLA risk haplotypes for psoriasis. The aim was now to see if the risk haplotypes correlate with the clinical disease. The series consisted of 64 patients and the clinical parameters were age of onset, family history of psoriasis, arthritis and clinical treatment periods at hospital. The HLA risk haplotypes including Cw6, DR7 and DQAl*0201 have heen foimd in 30% ofthe patients. The presence of these risk haplotypes correlated with earlier age of onset (P=0.027) and family history of psoriasis (P=0.022) but not with arthritis or the number of clinical treatment periods. Conclusion: HLA haplotypes with Cw6, DR7 and DQAl*0201 increase the penetrance of psoriasis genes in the family. The risk haplotypes precipitate the onset of psoriasis at an earlier age.",

Interestingly all proinflammatory cytokines were also detected in high numbers in acute monophasie EAE at height of the disease While TGF-P and IL-10 raised during recovery' phase of acute monophasie EAE, In contrast these two c>iokines as well as IL-4 were almost absent in SPR-EAE in remission.

The human SStissue presented a very diversified Fas staining pattern. The distribution of fas-positive cells among the infiltrating mononuciear cells was also disparate ranging from very few but mostly -30 % of the MNC. In the human SS tissue staining was mostly confined to acinar and ductal epithelium, but also very intense in the intcrstitium indicating presence of soluble Fas. Despite mutation of the Fas gene in the MRL/lpr strain, there was an expression of lhe apoptosis related Fas protein increasing with age in salivary glands of these mice (~1-3% of the MNC). Furthermore, specific antibody therapy against oligoclonally expanded TCR Vp families did not significantly influence the Fas expression. Overall, the Fas expression was much lower in the autoimmune mice than in humans. The pattern of fas expression in glandular tissue in SS suggests an involvement of this apoptosis-signalling receptor molecule in the pathogenesis and/or lymphoid cell accumulation. We have developed an unbiased single-sided specific PCR technique to study the expressed human kappa immunoglobuiin liglit chain genes iu mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (MNC). Approximately 50 gene products from a MNC pool from 11 individuals and 50 from a single individual were cloned from cDNA, sequenced, and assigned to the germline gene with the closest over-all homology. Some V^ families and genes were found to be used more often and some less often than expected from their occurence in the germ-line. Thus, family Vglll was found to be the most frequently expressed followed by V^l. The repertoire expressed in the pool was more versatile than in the single individual, but in both cases three germline genes {A27 (Hum k\\'32S), L6 (T'^) and A3/A19) were dominating. Overall, approximately 80 % of the sequences could be assigned to eight germline genes. The Jg proximal Vg genes was preferentially used. In the pool }^3 was expressed rarely. The sequences were very mutated with an average homology to the closest germline gene of only 93 %. N-additions were found in about half of the sequences. Unexpected lengths of CDRl were found in a few of the sequences assigned to germline genes belonging to family VKIII. Thus a sequence assigned to the L6 gene had five additional codoiis between codon 27 and 28. The sympathetic nervous system has been shown to influence inflammation and immune responsiveness. The aim of this study was to investigate if lymphoid cells are able to produce catecholamines and if catecholamines, once secreted, influence the immune reactivity. Mclhods: The dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) content in mouse spleen cells, peritoneal macrophages and T and B cell hybridomas v^as examined by capillary electrophoresis. Tbe impact of L-DOPA. DA and NE on proliferation, measured as thymidine uptake, and differentiation, measured as cytokine and immunogiobiilin production, was studied in vitro in mitogen driven cell cultures. Spleen cells were cultured with L-DOPA and caiecholamines and induction of apoptosis was studied by propidium iodide labeling and FACS detection of hypodiploid cell nuclei. Results: DA was detected in spleen cells, peritoneal macrophages, B cell hybridomas and 2 of 3 Tcell hybridomas in concentrations varying between 7x10'^''and 7x10''^ mole dopamine/cell. Also NE was found in a T cell clone and splenocytes. L-DOPA, dopamine and norepinephrine dose-dependently inhibited Con A and LPS stimulated proHferaiion, immunoglobulin production and formation of lL-2. INF-y and IL-6 by spleen cells. L-DOPA, DA and NE dose-dependently induced apoptosis of splenocyles. Conclusion: Since lymphocytes a) produce DA and NE, b) are suppressed by catecholamines and c) express catecholamine receptors there are biological prerequisites of an autocrine regulation of the activity of lymphocytes by catecholamines.",

Coculture of TEC and mature CD4+ T cells showed that TEC are able to present both alloantigens and superantigens to the CD4+ T ceils, as measured by increased proliferation of the T cells. The presentation is dependent on expression of MHC class II and possibly other costimuiatory adhesion molecules on TEC. TEC express ICAM-1, LFA-3 and CD40, TEC themselves are not stimulated to increased proliferation, but production of cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) from TEC enhances the CD41 T ceU respons. TEC do not express B7-1 but show a low expression of B7-.2 and the SAg presentation can be further increased by the addition of monoclonal antibody against CD28. TEC also present SAg to subpopulations of human thymocytes: CD4+8+. CD4+ and DN CD3 positive thymocytes. Thus TEC act as antigenpresenting cells but less eftective than professional antigenpresenting cells, due to the absent or weak expression of B7. This may support, that TEC are more important in positive than in negative selection. Oral tolerance was induced in Wisiar rats by feeding ovalbumin (OvA)-cont3ining pellets during 2 weeks. Two weeks after the end of feeding the rats were imrnunised with a mixture of OvA and human serum albumin (HSA) in Freund's complete adjuvant. Every fourth day between day 7 and day 26. the popliteal lymph nodes (draining the immunisation site) was removed. The enlargemenr of tbe lymph nodes, the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and tbe expression of TGF-p and IFN-y in the lymph node was monitored. In a parallcll set of rats, lhe specific antibody production was nionilored for 18 weeks afler immunisation. In lhe OvA-fed rats there was no size-increase of the draining lymph nodes afler immunisation, while tbe nodes of the control rats were heavily enlarged from day 13 to day 24 after immunisation. Furthennore, from day 7 lo day 15 scattered TGF-p expressing cells were present in the T-cell area of the lymph nodes of OvA-fed rats only. Tbe anti-OvA levels in sera from the rats revealed an initial B-cell priming of the OvA-fed group, with levels higher than [be control group during the Tirst to weeks. Tbereafter. suppression governed lhe respon.se, and from week 4 to 18 lhe anti-OvA levels were considerably lower ihan the controls. The suppression also affected, lhe response to the by.stander antigen HSA. as even the anti-HSA levels were lower in the OvA-fed group than in the control group.

By making use of Oiiidiii Cazeneva enigma, tlie sharing of idiotypic determinants by antibodies directed tn non-cross reacting epitopes [2], they further led to the concept of content-addrrstiable immune meinoiies [3] . This concept is especially interesting, since it ex* plains the structure behind the ability of pattern completion abilities of the immune system. In this study, we develop further the model introduced by Seiden and Celada [4] in order to study the pattern storage capacities of tlie immun*? systetn. This model is based on a non-standard rpllular automata. The results obtained shows clearly that the Ouidin-Cazenave enigma enables the pattern completion ability of the immune system.

The mucosal Ig response (numbers of IgA-, IgM-and IgGproducing immunocytes per defined mucosal length unit) as well as the local IgA subclass distribution were studied in by-passed jejunal segments with bacterial overgrowth and compared with normally functioning segments in adults. Sterile ilea! urinary conduits were likewise examined by immunohistochemistry in children; the mucosa showed metaplasia and glandular atrophy, but the median numbers of IgA, IgM and IgG immunocytes per mucosal length unit only tended to be decreased, Tbe jejunal segments with bacterial overgrowth showed minor histological changes and contained fairly normal numbers of IgA and IgG immunocytes, but there was a significant reduction (p<0.05) of IgM immunocytes (12 cells/length unit) compared with control mucosa (24 cells/length unit). The subclass distribution of IgA ininiunocytes showed for lgA2 tbat the median number per mucosal length unit was significantly decreased (p<0.01) in ileal conduits (7 cells or 30% of total IgA) but increased {p<0.05) in jejunal segments with bacterial overgrowth (42 cells or 43% of total IgA) compared with Ihat in normal ileum (15 cells or 40% of total IgA) and jejunum (24 cells or 23% of total IgA), respectively. These data suggested an association between intestinal bacterial load and topical IgA subclass production. Inierferon gamma and IL-4 have been found to play major regulatory roles in Thl and Th2 CD4 T cell differcniiation and therefore also crilically niiay affect mucosal immune responses. Since IFN-y production is abundant in mueosal tissues and lias recently been aseribed A critical role in epithelial cell functions, including llic expression of SC and irancylosis of secretoiy igA, we addressed whether lack of IFN--)' functions would afTect IgA responses following oral immuni/ations. Wild lype and IFN-y receplor (IFN-yR ) gene knockout mice were immunized pcrorally with KLH and cholera to.\\in (CT) as lhe mucosal adjuvanl. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of an impaired response lo oral immunization in IFN-yR deHcienl mice. Similar numbers of anti-KLH IgA SFC were recorded in wild type and IFN-yR deficient mice. However, at the systemic level signiricantly reduced specific lgG2a and IgG3 serum aniibody levels were observed in IFN-yR deficient mice. Also, in vitro stiniiitalions of perorally primed T cells with recall antigen gave 2-3-fold stronger proUferative responses ;ind liiglier IFNy production as compared to wild t>pc T cells. IgA B cell differentiation and epithelial trancytosis of secretory IgA appeared normal in IFN-yR deClCTcnl mice with comparable levels of lotal IgA and anu-CT IgA in lavage in immunized mice. Indeed, the local gut mucosal immune response was functional because antitoxic protection as analyzed by the ligiited loop test did not differ between wild lype and IFN-yR deficient mice Finally, we tested whether oral tolerance may be stimulated in the absence of IFN^. Consistently, we found strong suppression of systemic anti-KLH antibody responses if IFN-yR deficient mice fed KLH prior to the parenteral immunization We conclude that mucosal IgA imnuiiiity and oral tolerance appear to be unaffected by the lack of lFN-y function, suggesting that other factors such as IL-4 may compensate in vivo, Experiments in IFN-yR/lL-4 double knockout mice are underway. The levels of IgM and IgG antibodies to Re glycolipid of Salmonella minnesota strain Re 595 was determined in the blood sera of 56 children aged 4-12 years with chronic pyelonephritis by enzyme immunoassay <EiA) techniques, in cases of the exacerbation of the disease the level of IgM antibodies was elevated in 3 out of 6 children and the level nf IgG antibodies, in 1 child. At the stage of incomplete remission the proportion of positive sera was 67% and 45% (6 out of 9 ana 4 out of 9) respectively. During r^emission an elevated level of ^M antibodies was registered in 15 out of 40 sera (36%). The same number of sera had an elevated level of IgG antibodies. In the control group of children without any symptoms of infectious inflammatory processes no sera with elevated levels of IgG and IgM were detected. Thus, at the incomplete stage of remission patients were shown to yield positive reactions more often than at the period of exacerbation, while at the time of complete remission the number of patients yielding positive reactions decreased. It should be pointed out that at the stages of exacerbation and incomplete remission the number of sera with an elevated level of IgM antibodies considerably prevailed over the number of sera with an elevated level of IgG antibodies. The determination of the levels of IgM and IgG antibodies to Re glycolipid of Gram-negative bacteria was useful for the study of the specific features of serological reactions in renal and urinary tract diseases. In the early postnatal development of rats fed artificial milk diet gliadin induces proliferation of intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes similar thiii found in coeliac disL-ase. To study the effect of gliadin on bnisli-border inembrano enzyme activities the rat pups (inbred strain AVN) were since their birth nourished by intr:iga.sirically applied artificial tnilk diet. The first group of pups received in addition every other day gliadin, staning day 0, the second group was given gliadin troni day 7 and the third group, serving as conirol, recieved human albumin. On day 21 the rat.s were sacrified and the activities of sucra.se, lactase, glucoamyla.se and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were determined in isolated bnish-border membrane of jeiunal and ileal enterocytes. The activity of lactase of jejuna I and ileal brush borders of the first group was significantly decrea^sed while that ot* the second group increased in comparison with the control. The activities of sucrase and tilucoamylase were increased especially in the jejunum in both gliadiii-treated groups. DPP IV activity markedly decreased in the ileiiiu brush borders of the first group of ral pups. We conclude that gliadui-lreatment does not negatively affect the expression of typical developmental and diferenciation markers, such as sucrase and glucoamyla.se, during the first three weeks of pasttiatal life of the rat.",

Tbe A6H monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) raised primarily against human Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) has previously been shown to bind strongly to RCC. to a certain degree to colon carcinoma but only marginally to a variety of normal tissues, lmmunohistochemica! analysis of RCC tissues, containing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, revealed that A6H stained both tumor cells and lymphocytes. FACS analysis of human peripheral blood cells demonstrated that A6H mAb stained 85-90% of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not granulocyles, monocytes, NK-cells or Bcells. Furthermore 85-90% of naive and memory T helper cells were stained with A6H. suggesting that the A6H mAb defines unique subsets within these T cell populations. Dual staining showed that the A6H mAb bind to an antigen clearly distinct from a number of other cell surface molecules on T cells, including CD28. CD29. CD26. CD44 and ICAM-2. A6H mAh binding induced a second signal in anti -CD3 mAb activated T-celts. resulting in cell proliferation IL-2 receptor expression and vigouros production of IFN-y and TNF and minor amounts of IL-2. Immunoprecipitation with A6H mAb indicated a molecular weight of 120-140.000 on both T cells and RCC. We suggest thai the A6H niAb defines a unique T cell surface antigen, which is involved in signal transduction and is expressed on subsets of human T cells. Tbe coexpression of A6H on T celts and tumor cells suggests a possible function related to common properties among Ihese cells. The Leishmattia parasite is an intraceliular pathogen living inside human macrophages. The most abundant protein on the surface of Leishtruinia promastigotes is Ihe protease GP63. We have previously shown that T cells incubated with GP63 lose their ability to bind a pane! of monoclonal antibodies directed against Ihe CD4 antigen. CD4 is an important costimulatory molecule present on the surface of a subset of T cells. In this study we investigate whether this cleavage has a detrimental effect on the T celt function. Human T cell clones or PBMCs were preincubaled with GP63 (0-100^g/ml) and added to antigen pulsed antigeo presenting cells, where after proliferation, cytotoxicity, and expression of cell surface molecules were measured. Surprisingly, [he proliferative response of antigen stimulated T cells treated with GP63 was equivalent to that of untreated cells. We have analyzed the CD4 molecule of cells treated with GP63 using SDS-page and western blot. Results from these and other experiments will be presented. Membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), decay-accelerating factor (DAF. CD55), proteclin (CD59) and clusterin {SP40.40) are complement regulatory proteins with wide tissue distribution. In this study the presence and localization of these glycoproteins were investigated with respect to their roles in the protection of cells in exocrine glands from complement attack. Whole saliva and salivary gland tissues of patients with primary Sjdgren's syndrome (SS) were compared with similar specimens from control subjects. The presence of the soluble form of these proteins in saliva specimens was detected by Western blot and dot blot techniques. Expression of these proteins in tissue was assessed by immunoperoxidase staining. CD55, CD59 and SP40,40 were detected in saliva samples, and their estimated molecular mass was in the range previously reported. CD46 was not detectable in saliva. With respect to salivary gland specimens, staining was more widely distributed in inflamed salivary gland tissue than in normal tissue. Immunostaining of CD46, CD59 and SP40,40 was strongly positive, but staining of CD55 was weak. For normal specimens, staining was mainly confined to the luminal surface, in ductal walls, and in connective tissue. In the inflamed salivary glands these proteins were intensely expressed on acinar and ductal epithelium, with a high proportion of positive mononuclear lymphoid cells in tbe foci. These findings suggest that SS tissue exhibit enhanced complement activation. Expression of these proteins may be an important determinant of the severity of tissue injury produced by complement-fixing salivary gland (auto)antibodies in SS. Previously investigated vegetable oils have all been iriglycerids. In contrast, jojoba oil consists mainly of long straight-chain esters of C-20 and C-22 fatty alcohoh and acids. Another major difference is that jojoba oil is not readily catabolized in mammals as are the iriglycerids. !l was possible to prepare aqueous emulsions with jojoba oil and mannide monooleate (Arlacel A) without the use of co-stabilizing agents. Jojoba oil emulsions were shown to stimulate the humoral response to albumin in BALB/c mice and in guinea-pigs. In C57BU6J mice jojoba oil emulsions stimulated lymphocyte proliferation as measured by 'H-lhy uptake and the production of IFN-gamma and IL-6 when given with mycobacterial culture filtrate antigens. However, in all the experiments undertaken the stimulation achieved using jojoba oil emulsion was inferior to the performance of FIA. In BALB/c mice i.p. injection of mineral oil alone induced a much higher incidence of asciles production and mortality than injection of jojoba oil. It is concluded that jojoba oii emulsions are active as adjuvants for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. However, Iheir performance as such is inferior lo FIA. It is further concluded ihat low degradabiiily of the oil in an emulsion adjuvant is not in itself enough to explain the high efficacy of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Comparison was made of the deposition of anti-C3c-and anti-C3d-reactive fragments on normal B cells and the B celMine, RAJI, after exposure to normal human serum in the absence and presence of 5 mM MgCl2/20 mM EGTA, to block the Ca^^-dependent classical activation pathway.",

The implications of these findings will be discussed. This project is based on a well-studied interaction of a particular T ceil receptor which is specific for a peptide {9M0I(yl2-\"'')) bound to MHC class II (I-E\"). The A2^\" peptide constitutes one of the antigen binding loops (CDR3) of an antibody light chain, and loops corresponding to the CDRs are present in all Ab domains. To study how antigen presentation of the peptide is dependent on its position in different protein contexts, we u.sed in vitro mutagenesis to move the epitope to loops in the human IgG3 heavy chain. Three different mutants were made, each with one of the three CDR-corresponding loops of the Cul domain replaced with the A2 \" peptide. These mutants were transfected into an I-E * fibroblast cell line, and the resulting clones assayed for ability to stimulate A2\"^ specific T cells. It appears that the mutated heavy chains are retained intracellularly in the transfected fibroblasts, nevertheless, presentation on class II is obtained. We observe different efficiencies of antigen presentation when the epitope is inserted in different positions in the heavy chain. Cytokine mRNA expression in freshly isolated intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), in in vitro stimulated IEL and in subfractionated IEL was determined using RT-PCR. Freshly i.solated IEL from different levels of the intestine showed strikingly similar cytokine profiles. Thus. IEL from jejunum, ileum and colon expressed mRNA for CD45RO as well as for IL-ip, lL-2, lL-8, IFN-yand TNF-a. IEL from ileum also expressed TGF-p 1. /\u00ab vitro activation of IEL from small intestine induced expression of IL-10, TNF-p, TGF-Pl, IL-2, IFN-yand TNF-a. Taken together the cytokine profile suggests that IEL are involved in cell mediated cytotoxicity and suppressor functions in vivo. Cytokine analysis of subfractionated IEL showed that the three major subpopulations, TCR-^+, TCRap+ and TCRXDl + IEL, all expressed IL-2, IFN-yand TNF-a which is consistent with TH I and/or cytotoxic effector functions.

Small intestinal epithelial cells may therefore funclion as antigen presenting cells. However, they only expressed mRNA for IL\" I p, IL-8 and occa.sionally TNF-a suggesting that antigen presentation by epithelial cells may lead to anergy in IEL. The X5 gene is expressed only in pre-B cells. The 5' region of the X5 gene can be divided into 2 regions; Bx5 which allows expression only in pre-B cells and Ax5 which acts as promoter, contains all transcription initiation sites and is active in ail cell types. Two Ax5-derived oligonucleotides (Inrx5:i and Inrx5:2). each with a transcription start site, promote transcription in transient transfection assays, while a third oligonucleotide (+90X.5), without a transcription initiation site, is inactive. The Inrx5:] and Inrj.5:2 oHgonucleotides, but not +90x5, form a DNA-protein complex containing c-myc and myn (murine homologue of Max) in gel retardation analysis. The myc and myn/Max proteins bind also to several other initiator-like sequences present in genes expressed early in B cell development. Transient transfection analysis suggest that, in this system, transcription depends on a transcription initiation site and appropriate flanking sequences. The significance of c-myc binding to these intitiators is not clear, however, overexpression of c-myc in co-transfection assays represses the transcriptional activity of the X5 initiator. Genetically detennined factors may be imponani for the response to vaccines. Outbred mice do nol exhibit the extent of genetic variation found in a human population. Inbied strains of mice may show large, genetically detennined differences in their immune response. As part of the Dutch-Nordic Vaccine Consortium's effons to develop a new pneumococcal polysaccharide proteinconjugate vaccine, we studied the response to s.c. immunization with a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax'^N) in two inbred .strains of mice, BALB/cABom and C.*i7BL/6JBom, and in ombred Hsd:NIHS mice. Tlie IgM antibody response 6 days after vaccination measured in an RUSA assay with tlie vaccine as antigen, was largest in BALB/c mice aiui lowest in C57BL/6J mice. After 13 and 30 days. BALB/c and NIHS mice showed .similar antibody levels, whereas C57BL/6J mice continued to show a lower response. The outbred NIHS mice showed great variation in their response serotype 6B. BALB/c mice showed a faster response to this serotype after vaccination than C57BL/(iJ mice. The response to lliree other serotypes. 14, 19F and 23F. was viiiniiUy absent in all the mouse strains. Low levels of IgG antibodies were detected only in some NIHS mice. Thus, BALB/c. C57BL/6J, and NIHS mice differed markedly in their response to a conventional polysaccharide vaccine. Acquisition of peripheral tolerance is unclear but at tfie T cell level, anergy has been suggested as tfie main mechanism of peripheral toleraice. Anergy is attained by viable cells afler exposure to an aj^ropriate signal. These cells are thought not to be deleted but are rendered anergic upon stimulation with tfie same signal. Many experiments studying peripheral tolerance have been carried out in vivo In our laboratory two metfwds are carried out to study tfiis mechanism in viim. Both methods are based on providing a negative signal to the niunne T cell neceptor region(TCR), Vp8. Afler receiving a subsequent second signal ftoni a polyclcnal activator like Con A, the VpS family would not increase in numbers despite the presoice of otfier transformed and proliferating T cells. The importance of the second signal is to induce proliferation because prolonged stimulation with tfie first signal appears to result in cell deatfi TCR monoclonal antibody. F23.1 (aiti-Vp8.1,2,3) and a superantigen, Staphyloccal Enterotoxin B, (SEB). were used to provide tfiis negative signal to the Vp8 region of tfie TCR In tfie first system, cetls were cultured witfi eitfier the soluble or immobilised fomi of F23.1 monoclonal antibody. The soluble fomiof F23 1, significantly reduced the Con A induced proliferation. In tfie second system, SEB was cultured with pure T cells {>80% purity) 0/N then recultured witfi Con A. Reduction in T cell proliferation with Con A stimulation can be seen in purified T cell cultures (day I to 2 but txjt on d^ 3). The presence of remaining APCs mi^t cause interference at tfie presentation level i.e. SEB would be presented to T cdls leading to proliferation instead of anergy.

Methods: Cynomolgus monkeys were inoculated with a SIVSM stock propagated in vitro on cynomolgus monkeys PBMCs. Tenfold serial dilutions of stock virus ranging from 10\"' to 10\"3 was autraniatic applicated intrarectally (iR) in 6 monkeys (2 animals for each dilution). Infection was monitored by virus isolation and PCR{gag, pol, env, LTR). Virus specifc immunity was investigated by ELISA, Western blot, T-cell proliferation(HIV-2 viral lysate, SIV env synthetic peptides) and CTL{gag/pol, nef). Results: Infection was demonstrated by positive virus isolation and PCR and by se reconversion in two of Iwo monkeys given the 10\"' dilution and 1/2 became infected given the 10\"2 dilution. The remaining three IR inoculated animals did not become infected as shown by negative virus isolation, serology and PCR but showed SIV specific gag/pol and nef CTL and T-cell proliferation against SIV env synthetic peptides. Conclusions: Monkeys exposed to low concentrations of SIV developed SIV specific CTL and T-cell proliferation but no demonstrable viral antibodies. These animals have recently been rechallenged with a higher dose to determine if the cellular immunity can confer protection against challenge. In previous studies in this laboratory preformed IC were employed in flowcytometrical analyses of the distribution of immune complexes (IC) on blood cells and the buffering capacity of erythrocytes (E). In an effort to approach more closely physiological conditions, we have chosen to examine the binding to whole blood celts of IC formed in situ from FITCconjugated tetanus loxoid (TT) and natural anti-TT antibodies contained in the donor serum. To this end, the anti-TT levels of a range donors were assessed by ELISA, and selected donors were employed in the investigations.",

The T-cell hybridomas recognize the immunodominant peptide 011(256-270). and are either reactive with the naked peptide or demands the presence of hydroxylysine-linked carbohydrates within this determinant.

Development of an inflammatory self-limiting polyarthritis can be provoked in DA rats by Freunds incomplete adjuvant (FIA), Rats from the same strain develop a more severe and chronic arthritis when rat type II collagen (RCII) is administred with FIA. If an irrelevant antigen is added to these arthritogens. in this case ovalbumin (Ova), the development of arthritis is completely inhibited. This inhibition is disease-specific and long-lasting. To investigate mechanisms responsible for induction, as well as inhibition of arthritis, a kinetic study of local cytokine production in lymph nodes has been performed in rats immunized with the above mentioned agents. By using in situ hybridization techniques, the mRNA expression of TNFa, IL2, IFNy and IL4 was determined. A rapid and pronounced expression of TNFa mRNA was recorded in RCII/FIA and FIA immunized rats, already 2 hours after immunization. This pronounced expression was not observed in Ova/FIA injected animals, which instead were the only animals where the IL4 gene was expressed. The expression of IPN7 mRNA was limited in RCIl/FlA-and FIAimmunized rats, whereas IL2 mRNA expression was only detected after RCII/FIA injection. Lymph node cells from RClI-immunized animals generated a high amount of TNFa after restimulation with RCII. whereas restimulation with the mitogen Con A generated a cytokine mRNA response dominated by IL2 and IFNy. These and other results indicate that a strong local expression of TNFa, induced by arthritogenic stimuli, may be important for the induction of athritis. Moreover, the elicitation of an immune reaction to an irrelevant antigen, may inhibit arthritis development by modulating the arthritis associated cytokine response.

IL^ and IL-10 mRNA in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 77 patients with MS, 23 with optic neuritis (ON) and controls The MS patients had elevated numbers of blood MNC expressing all 6 c>tokines both when enumerated without previous culture and after culture with myelin basic protein (MBP), IFN-y, TNF-a, TGF-P and IL-4 were further enriched in the CSF of MS patients. Numbers of TNF-a niRNA expressing blood MNC correlated positively with the severity and progression of MS, In contrast, TGF-P and lL-4 were significantly higher in patients with shorter duration and minor disability, suggesting beneficial downregulating effect of IL-4 and TGF-p in MS, Patients with ON. in many instances representing early MS. had similarly augmented numbers of TNF-a, TNF-p and IL-10 positive blood MNC as clinically definite MS, ON patients examined within one month after onset had lower numbers of MBP induced IL-10 mRNA expressing cells compared to remission, indicating a possible protective role of IL-10, The results suggest that IFN-y.

These cytokines may further enhance the inflammatory process, but organ-specific differences must be taken into account. Methods: To evaluate cytokine profiles of putative importance for the development of inflammatory bowel disease, we examined human intestinal microvascular endothelial cell (HIMEC) mRNA expression for 12 cytokines with reverse Iranscriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). The cytokine profiles were compared with those obtained in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Cells were cultured to confiuence in I3-weIl plates and then stimulated for 4 h with rh IL-1 p (100 U/ml) or rh IL-* (100 U/ml). Different cytckine mRNAs were delected by cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification of polyA RNA isolated from cultured cells. Results: Unstimulated HIMEC expressed low levels of mRNA for IL-ip, IL-6 and TNFa. However. IL-lp, and to a lesser degree IL-4, increased mRNA for these three cytokines. We were unable to detect mRNA for ILla. IL-2. IL-3. IL-4. IL-5. IL-10 or IFN-y in HIMEC. By comparison, in HUVEC IL-lp stimulated mRNA for IL-1 a,IL-lp and IL-6, but not for the other cytokines.

They have also been ascribed a role m controlling myelopoesis and lymphocyte development. We set out to investigate if NK cells have a role in controlling the intensity of in vivo inflammatory responses. Methods: In outbred SWISS mice, NK celts v\\ere depleted by repeated intrapcritonca! injections with an antibody to the NKl.l. antigen, derived from the mouse hybridoma PK136. Controls received an antibody to Herpes virus. Granulocyte mediated inflammation was induced by injection of 30 microliters of olive oil intradcrmally in the hind ftxjtpad. 24 hours later, swelling of the footpad was registered. In other experiments, mice were immunized and boostered with oxa/.olonc to asess delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH). Results: Granulocyte mediated inflammation was not significantly changed 24 hours after NK cell depletion. Alter 8 days, a significant (p < 0,05) increase of swelling was registered. Concomitantly. there was a tendency towards increased numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes and granulocytes. In the DTH model, a tendency for increased reaction was seen in NK cell depleted mice. Conclusion: Our results ptimt to an important role lor NK cells in regulating the intensity of inflammatory response. However, we believe that the NK cells down-regulate the development of effector cells, neutrophils and possibly also monocytcs/macrophagcs. rather than excerting suppression during the inflammatory response itself. A new hypothesis based on experimental work with various non-specific immunological stimulators is presented for better characterization and deeper understanding of the underlying processes in immunologiac response. Nocicepsis is the description of the disturbance of cell surface homeoslasis by intimate physicochemical force leading to nerve cell stimulus. Nocicepsis can also be applied to the ignition pbe nomeon in the lympho-reticulo-endothclial defence mechanisms. The triggering force in the contact of intruding microtie.pollen or other non-self moiety with the responding L-RES cell is exe cuted by the electrochemical differnce in the intimate cell surface milieu. This nonspecific electrochemical shock brought by the intruding agent leads then to revealing and aclivalion of more specific signal mechanisms. This primary triggering is a well conserved unicellular phanomenon in contrast lo the sequelae, where the functioning is dependenl sophisticated cell lo cell contacts and interactions. Such evolutionally younger interaction mechanisms include various adhesion and immunological rcseptors as well the array of local and more general modifying mechanisms served by cyto kines.inflmmalory,allergic and neural mediators and various hormones. Their eletncntary function is to inhibit the spreading of tlie harmful element by needed amplification or suppression of various required cell poplations in a regulated manner leading in the end to extermination of the intruder.

Overlapping synthetic peptides covering the respective HSP sequences were then used to map epitopes of the HSP reactive T cell lines or clones identified whereas a combination of blocking and panel studies were applied to identify the HLA molecules presenting the individual epitopes. Two epitopes of the HSP18 molecule presented by HLA-DR4,Dw4 and DRl, respectively, was identified. T cells recognized the mycobacleriai HSP65 antigen in the context of HLA-DR 1, DR2, DR5, DR7, and interestingly DR4 (Dw4 and Dwl4).

In addition the proliferating T cells activated via CDG and CD28 expressed lL-2 mRNA. The CD6/TPA-induced T cell proliferation was completely inhibited by cyclosporin A, however the proliferative response after crossiinking of CDG and CD28 was partially inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug. Our data provide evidence for a pathway of antigen-independent T cell activation via CDG and CD28 , which is lL-2 dependent.

This approach does not cover noncaDsuIar strains, which makes if difficult to study the role of these forms of bacteria, as well as fonns with a small capsule, in human pathology-\\ye analyzed variability of pneumococcal strains from me international collection by the Isolation of immunochemically active pneumococcal proteins. The protein preparations of 46 \u00a7 neumococcal strains of known serotypes were subiected to DS get electrophoresis with subsequent immuno^blptting. Immunochemically active components were detected with the use of blood sera from patients with bacieriologically identified pneumococcal infection, as well as blood sera from clinically healthy adults. The presence of immunochemically active proteins with mol. wt. between 50 and 95 kD, as well as protein with a mol. wt. of ca-80 kD, common for all strains under study, was established. Some of these proteins were common for strains of different serological tyDes (strain 77/64 of type 22A and strain 39/57 oF type T?), while some of them exhibited an identical pattern for one serperoup strains of one serogroup (strains 55/51 and 52/57, serogroup 35). The possibility of using this active protein antigens as markers of pneiimococcal infection is considered. We could ihus distinctly differentiate S.pnenmoniae strains by some features other than the size of their capsules and their type. It would be interesting to find out the existence of epidemiqlogical correlation Detween protein types and the morbidity rate and severity of pneumococcal infection. Malaiia infections mean long lasting antigenic exposure of the human host. Sucli persistant stimulation affects the balance between CD4+ cells of Tli 1 and Th2 type with consequences for the course and final outcome ofthe infection. Th2 cell produced lL-4 Is responsible for the switch of the immunoglobulin isotype production of B cells from IgM/IgG to IgE. Besides being the major immunoglobulin causing allergic reactions, IgE elevation is also a hallmark of helminthic infections. However high IgE levels have recently also been encountered in protozoal diseases, for example in Leishmania infections. More recently, we and others have also fotind significantly elevated levels of total as well as IgE anti-malarial antibodies in F.falciparum malaria. That IgE is indticed by the malaiia parasites is supported by the finding of elevated IgE in mice experimentally infected with F.chabaudl where the final clearance of the infection has been shown to be dependent on a Th2 response. In contrast we saw no elevation of IgE in mice infected with F.vinckei vinckei where immunity is dependent on a Thl response. The influence of host genetic factors is suggested by the remarkable stability of the IgE antibody profiles over time and irrespective of season in an area with high and perennial Uansmission . Significantly higher IgE in Gambian children with cerebral F.falciparum disease than in uncomplicated cases might suggest that IgE is pathogenic in malaria-However IgE mediated reactions involving cells equipped with Fcg receptors have been shown to efficiently kill helminthic pai'asites in vitro. Further studies will hopefully give insight in the question of IgE's role for protection and/or pathogenesis in malaria.

The differential expression of homing receptors on circulating ASC from different mucosal sites was also demonstrated, supporting a degree of compartmentalization of the mucosal imtnune systems of the upper versus the lower aerodigestive tract. Human y-globuHn (HGG) was used as a model protein antigen for covalent coupling to CTB and LTB respectively, and subsequent comparision of these conjugates for oral-mucosal immunization or tolarization respectively.

In contrast to native SEA no deletion of CD4+ cells expressing the SEA reactive TCR Vp 3 or 11 was observed after repeated injections of C215Fab-SEA. On the contrary, a 10 fold increase of CD4+ TCR Vp 3+ cells was observed.

Several of these factors have considerable homology in amino acid sequence, eg. in the N-terminal end A CFA/I subunit MAb specific for the N-terminal end of CFA/1 can inhibit attachment of both homologous and heterologous ETEC strains to enterocytes. Methods: A peptide of the 25 N-terminal aminc acids of the CFA/I subunit protein was synthesized. Coupling to BSA was done by using the SPDP method, The accessability of the peptide epitope on the conjugate was assessed by EUSA using the peptide-specific MAb Rabbits were immunized four times s c. with 500 )ig of either uncoupled or coupled peptide using adjuvant The sera tested in ELISA for reactivity with CFA/I peptide and several different purified CF fimbriae. Functional analyses were done by hemagglutination inhibition and by inhibition of binding to isolated human small intestinal enterocytes. Results: Immunization not only with the conjugate but also with the unconjugated peptide resulted in equally high specific antibody titres against the CFA/1 fimbriae and against the peptide The titres against several other fimbriae were also increased but only against those with a related sequence. Interestingly, only antiserum against the coupled peptide could inhibit binding of ETEC bacteria to the cells.

This phenomenon has been linked to ihc MHC, and in particular, to lhe al/a2 domains of the MHC class 1 molecules. Here, we have addressed the role of MHC class I bound peptides in NK cell-mediated Fi-hybrid anii-parentai rejection by studying the resistance of F)-hybrids between B6 and differcnl bm muiant strains to B6-dcrived RBL-5 lymphoma cell line. Tumor development occurred at a similar frequency in all combinations of (B6Xbm)Fi mice and control B6 mice. These results suggest ihat absence of a specific MHC class I presented peptide repertoire on grafted cells is not sufficient lo induce NK cell-mediated Fl-hybrid anti-parental rejection responses.",

Class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) affect target cell sensitivity lo natural killer (NK) cell lysis, and influence the development of the NK cell repertoire. In the mouse, absence of MHC class I molecules on target cells is associated with an increased susceptibility to NK cell mediated lysis, while syngeneic class 1 molecules confer protection. In contrast to the protective role of syngeneic class I molecules, less is known about the interaction between murine NK cells and allogeneic class 1 MHC molecules. In theory, such could either be triggering, inert or inhibitory. To directly address the role of allogeneic class I in Interaction with NK cells of the mouse, a panel of polyclonal allogeneic murine NK cells were exposed to H-iP class I positive or negative target cells, and susceptibility to lysis was assessed. For all effectors studied, regardless of H-2 haplotype or genetic background, a preferential killing of class I deficient targets was observed. This pattern was observed JH vitro with tumor as well as lymphobiast targets, and in vivo in rapid elimination studies of radiolabeled tumor cells. The results demonstrate that protection from murine NK celt mediated lysis can be conferred by the expression of allogeneic class I molecules. No evidence for a triggering effect caused by the expression of allogeneic class I molecules was observed. The data are discussed in relation to current models on NK cell/MHC class 1 interactions, alloreactivity mediated by NK cells, and the role of NK cells in allogeneic graft rejection responses.",

Cross-linking of MHC Class I molecules (MHC-l) induces signals in human T-cells. We have studied the biochemical signal-pathway that leads to IL2 production and IL2 receptor (CD25) upregulation. Our results suggest that MHC-I signaling iniiially is dependent on tyrosine kinase activity whicli induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-yl, leading to a rise in the intracellular free Ca^* concentration. MHC-I signal transduction is dependent on surface expression of the TCR/CD3 and CD45 molecules.

Eight children with asthmatic symptoms and one adult with atopic eczema were tested. Allergens were the most common ones in the living environment of the patients: dog, cat, horse, timothy grass, birch, fish, egg and milk. Skin tests were performed with routine prick testing. sLT were released from isolated leucocjrtes in the presence of allergen and measured by a novel test (Buhlmann Laboratories, Basel, Switzerland), the Cellular Allergen Stimulation Test (CAST-ELISA) hased on the detection of LTC4, LTD4 and LTF4 by a monoclonal antibody. Correlation between skin tests and sLT production: sLT production Infection of inbred C57BL/6 mice by asexual blood-stages of P. berghei malaria parasites invariably results in a fata! disease course. However, there are two distinct clinical syndromes, related to the size of the infective inoculum.'Either death occurs during the second week of infection with marked neurological symptoms (known as experimental cerebral malaria or ECM), or several weeks later as the result of gross anaemia and hyperparasitaemia without any apparent neurological involvement. We have investigated in detail how the course of infection in this system depends on the size of the infective inoculum. Mice were infected intraperitoneally with 1x10^ to 1x10^ blood-stage P. berghei Kt73 parasites, and the course of Infection was followed daily by measuring parasitaemia, reticulocyte count, and rectal temperature. Low infection doses resulted in ECM in all mice, while no mice developed ECM after high dose infection. Intermediate dose infection caused some but not al! mice to develop ECM. Detailed results of these experiments will be presented, and the possible background for the dependency of the clinical outcome on the size of the infection inoculum will be discussed. Coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) induces an actJte and fatal diarrhea in newborn piglets, as well as an intense and early production of interferon u (IFN-\u00ab). We have previously shown that in vitro Indudble porcine IFN-u secreting cells {IFN-ix SC) were present in pig fetal hematopoietic organs at early stages of gestation (Splichal et al.,Immunol. Letters, 1994, 43. 203-208) . In the present study, miniature pig fetuses were treated by TGEV via umbilical cord vein injection after laparotomy and uterotomy of anaesthetized pregnant sows. Control fetuses were subjected to the same surgery. All fetuses were delivered 20 hrs after surgery. Cell suspensions from blood, liver. bone-martow and spleen were incubated fcr 10 hrs in tissue culture microplates or nitrocellulose-bottomed microplates coated with anti-pig IFN-it mAb. IFN-u titers in supernatants were determined by a specific ELISA. whereas IFN-a SC frequency was obtained by an ELISPOT assay. Flow cytometry was performed to characterize CD 45, CD 4. SLA class il and 74-22-15 G/M positive cells. IFN-.x SC and IFN-u production were detected after in utero TGEV injection of fetuses at the second half period of gestation. IFN-a SC were more abundant in nonadfierent cell preparations than in total cell suspensions. These results show the presence of IFN-u SC in porcine fetal lymphohematopoietic organs following in utero exposure to TGEV. Comparability of measurement results is essential for research studies. Validation of analytical methods by a method evaluation study is therefore required before methods are used for research purposes. In this study a method evaluation of an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for determination of IgA in human serum was performed by use of the programme AMIQAS. The ELISA was set up as a sandwich ELISA using antibody against IgA for coating microtiterptates. Method evaluation samples were prepared from a serum sample with a high concentration of IgA (6.5 g/L) and an IgA-deficient serum sample in the ratio 1+5, 2+4, 3+3. 4+2, 5+1, 6+0, The serum samples were run in a dilution of 1/40,000. The detection range established by this method evaluation was shown to be 0.3 -6.5 g/L. The method evaluation analysis showed that the method was in analytical and statistical control. No significant systematical errors could be demonstrated. IgA may be used as a marker of exposure to microorganisms or to stress. The method is currendy being used for investigations of IgA levels in serum from waste collectors and from workers employed in the textil industry. Waste collectors are exposed to a variety of different microorganisms during collection of waste. These microorganisms are mainly fungi and actinomycetes, and to a lesser extent bacteria. Investigations were performed with waste collectors collecting compostable waste in order to determine the microbial exposure and their specific antibody response against microorganisms. Waste collectors were equipped with filters for collection of airborne microorganisms. The microorganisms found on filters wen; cultivated on selective media. The predominant microorganisms were found to be fungi of the Penicillium and Aspergillus species, and actinomycetes. Serum from the waste collectors was investigated for antibody response (IgG, IgE, IgA) against the cultivated microorganisms in SDS-PAGE and immunobloiting. Various antiboby responses (IgG) were found against Aspergillus fumigatus. which is a fungus that can give respiratory symptoms. Other antibody responses were found against different microorganisms cultivated from exposed filters. These are being further investigated.",

The 0(jM/pMBP-28 complexes were isolated by PEG precipitation and affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose, protein A-Sepharose and anti-IgM Sepharose. The occurrence of o(2M/pMBP-28 complexes was further indicated by use of an anti-a^M affinity column and chelating Sepharose loaded with Zn'*. The eluates from these affinity columns showed a^M and pMBP-28 in SDS-PAGE and Westem blotting. Furthermore, the OjM/ pMBP-28 complexes were demonstrated by electron microscopy. Fractionation of pMBP-containing D-mannose eluate from mannan-Sepharose on Superose 6 showed two protein peaks which reacted with anti-Cls antibodies in ELISA, one of about 750 kDa which in addition contained pMBP-28 and anti-ajM reactive material, the other with an M, of 100-150 kDa. The latter peak revealed rhomboid molecules (7 x 15 nm) in the electron microscope and a 67 kDa band in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. This band was also seen in eluates from the anti-a^M and chelating columns. Based on these obset^ations we propose a model for the interaction of pMBP-28 with OjM. Serum amyloid P component (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are members of the pentraxin protein family. SAP is the precursor protein to amyloid P component present in all forms of amyloidosis.

We have investigated by gel permeation chromatography the M, of SAP in freshly collected human serum and of SAP purified by carbohydrate affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography.

RF from the synovial tissues of RA patients preferentially use VH 3 gene segments together with a diverse array of V,,, This contrasts with RF derived from the peripheral blood of healthy donors, v^here the great majority utilize light chain segments of the kappa 3 family, and VH1 heavy chain segments are frequently used. RF from both groups were frequently found to be extensively mutated in the VH segment However, inspection of the R:S ratios in the CDR1+2 of these antibodies revealed that there was a strong selective pressure acting against mutations leading to amino acid replacements in the RF from healthy individuals. This was not seen in RF from RA patients. Affinity measurements indicate that RF in healthy individuals do not undergo affinity maturation, and that RF in RA may develop high affinity for IgG which may be of significance to the pathology of the disease. Preliminary studies suggest the existence of several different serotypes of//, pylori In this study, the capacity of//, pylori to induce type-specific Immune responses was studied. Sera and gastric aspirates from 11 //. pylori infected Swedish adults were tested for specific antibodies against membrane preparations (MPs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prepared from the study subjects' own strains and with corresponding antigens from two reference//, pylori strains using different ELISA methods It was found that sera from 6 ofthe 11 subjects had significantly higher IgA antibody titers and 4 sera had higher IgG titers against MPs from the homologous strains than from the reference strains Five sera had higher IgA titers and 5 sera had higher IgG titers against LPS prepared from the subject s own strain than against LPS preparations from the two reference strains. Similarly, gastric aspirates from six subjects had higher IgA titers against the homologous than the heterologous MPs and five aspirates reacted in higher IgA titer with the homologous LPS. In immunoblotting analyses, sera showed stronger reactivities with homologous than with heterologous LPS preparations. The results support the existence of different serotypes of H. pylori expressing strain-specific antigenic determinants that are immunogenic in vivo. Mice of various inbred strains of conventional euthymic mice were fed by gliadin in attempts to induce enteropathy. Gliadin was administered intragastrically for two months starting in 10 days old mice, bovine serum albumin (BSA) fed mice served as controls.As conventional mice were not sensitive to gliadin feeding, immunodeficient strains of mice: athymic nu/nu Baib/c mice, mice with targeted disruption of IL-2 gene (IL-2 K.O.) and mouse strain with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), were used to determine the possible effect of long term gliadin feeding on their intestinal mucosa. Profound changes of intestinal mucosa were found in specimens of jejuna of gliadin fed athymic nude mice. Computer image analysis revealed markedly lower values of villi lengths and areas in gliadin fed nude mice as compared with BSA fed controls. IL-2 K.O. and SCID mice exert only minimal changes. The differences in response to gliadin feeding among various experimental models suggest that impairment of immunoregulatory mechanism is responsible for induction of intestinal lesions. T lymphocytes accumulate in the rheumatoid synovium. TheT cell derived cytokines IFNy and IL4 are produced following activation and affect the activity of other cells in the compartment. However, there are contlicting results concerning the production capacity of cytokine production in the synovium. In this study We compared the in vitro activation ofT-lymphocytes from synovial tissue (ST) and fx:ripheral blood (PB) in patients with RA by measuring IFNy and IL4 levels after in vitro stimulation of mononuclear cell suspensions. Methods: ST and PB samples from 18 patients with RA wei-e obtained. Mononuclear cell suspensions were cultured for 72 hours in medium containing ConA. Cell-free supernatants were analysed for IFNg-and IL4 contents. Results: No spontaneous production of IFNv wa.s detected in any of the PB or ST cultures. In contrast, after stimulation with ConA was detected inl2/14 PB {3400+4200U/ml) and 13/14 ST (5300+6300U/ml) cultures A spontaneous IL4 production was detected in 8/17 PB (600\u00b1300pg/ml) and 8/17 ST (10(>+400pg/ml) cultures. A mitogen-induced IL4-production was detected in 12/16 PB(3200+4100pg/ml) and 13/16 ST (900+1900 pg/ml) cultures. In 10 of these 16 patients the synovial IL4 prtxiuction was lower than in matched PB samples. Conclusion: No significant differences in the activation between PB and ST T-lymphocytes are found with respect to the mitogen induced synthesis of IFNg and IL4. In addition, there was no apparent dominance of Thl or Th2 population in any of the two compartments analysed in patients with RA. Tlie Chinese population in Hong Kong has extremely low incidence of invasive H. influenme type b (Hib) infecUon as well as of cwriage of the microorganism Although there is no vaccinaiion against Hib in ttong Kong significant amounl of IgG antibody against Hib capsular polysaccharide (CPl was found in healthy children and adults with ELISA (Lau ei al.,1994) . The origin of these anUbodies may be cross-reactive antigens like CP of E.coti K 100 which is very similar to Hib CP. The aim was to detennine the isotype and idiotype distribution of natural antibody against Hih CP in healthy Hong Kong residenu. ELISA of 20 sera using biotinylaied Hib CP showed antibodies against Hib CP in all individtials. The antibodies were mainly IgG2. btit in most samples also IgA and IgCi4. Three intlividuaLs had IgGl and two IgM antibodies. The only child had the highest IgGl anUbody level. Isoelectric focusing/immunoblotdng (IRF) pattems of lgG2 antibody cloties against CP of Hib and E.coti K 100 were very similar in almosi ail cases. Three individuals had additional clones for K 100 CP as compared to Hib CP. which disappeared after absorpUon with K 100 CP in two cases. Spectrotypic analysis of IgG antibodies belonging to the Hib idiotype 1 (Id-1) a-ucas et.al.,1991) revealed much stronger EF patterns as compared to the Hib CP specific IgG2 antibody wiUi bands in different locations. The high reactivity or serum IgG IgA and IgM against monoclonal antibody to Hib Id-I (a-Id-l) was also found in ELISA. This reacUvily was not abolished after absorpUon of the sera either with Hib CP or K 100 CP. Tbe data indicate the higb prevalence of ld-1 in the Hong Kong populaUon. However, the share of Id-1 among Hib CP specific antibodies was significant only in one individual. Others bad much lower activity of Id-1 anti-Hib CP antibodies as compared to the total IgG Id-I. T^at may indicate thai the Hong Kong subjects have Id-1 positive anUbodies in their serum that are not specific for Hib CP. This is consistent wilh the nature of Id-1 which is a marker of the A2Vi^ region nsage rather than a marker of Hib CP paratopes. We suggest that natural antibodies to Hib CP found at high levels in the sera of healthy Hong Kong Chinese arc the product of exposure to crossreactive andBens different figm E.coli K 100 CP. Colonization of the embryonic thymus by hematopoietic progenitors depends on the adhesion of these cells to the thymic vascular surface, extravasation, and transepithelial migration. Using the chicken, which offeis excellent access to the embryo, we searched for T cell progenitor-specific antibodies that could interfere with thymus homing. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2-264 recognized thymocytes from embryonic day 12 onwards, but the expression level of the antigen decreased upon thymocyte differentiation. In the adult, only low expression was found on 5-10% of blood and spleen cells. The expression of this protein is highest on CD4'8' thymocytes. intermediate on CD4+8+ thymocytes. and low on CD4-8* thymocytes. CD4+8\" thymocytes lack the 2-264 antigen. A subpopulation of embryonic bone marrow cells and vascular endothelial cells are 2-264+. From thymocytes and a transformed T cell line. mAb 2-264 precipitated a molecule of 110 kD both under reducing and nonreducing conditions. An embryonic chicken thymocyte cDNA library in the vector pCDNA3 was saeened in a COS cell transient transfection system, and a 1.8 kb cDNA clone was isolated. The protein predicted from the nucleotide sequence is an adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It consists of five extracellular Ig domains, a transmembrane region and a shon cytopiasmic tail. As 2-264+ cells in 13-day embryonic bone marrow in a high frequency give rise to T cells after intrathymic reconstitution in the congenic chickens, we suggest that this protein is involved in T cell precursor migration into the thymus. Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent infectious agent in hematogenously spread kidney infections in man.The aim of our study was to develop a model of this disease and to characterize in situ inflammatory reactions. Materials and methods: Sixty Swiss mice were inoculated i.v. with 0,8 xlO''S.aureus of LS-1 strain. At days 1,4.7.14,21 and 32 after inoculation the mice were sacrificed. Bacj^dal cultures from blood, iirine and kidneys were obtained.In adition . histopathological and immunohisiochcmical evaluation of kidneys was performed. Results; Within the first week after inoculation peak values of tissue resident S.aureus were observed,Histopathologically both focal and diffuse inflammatory infiltrates were seen in kidney cortex and medulla. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed high numbers of Mac-1\"*\" phagocytic cells as well as CD 4\"'' and CD 8\"'' lymphocytes. Many of T cells stained for Vbeta 4,7, lOb and 11 TCR families.",

            "text": "We describe a first model of hematogenousiy acquired S.aureus nephritis.Immunohistochemical data suggest that T lymphocytes vividly participate in the course of this disease. We have found that IL-4-targcted mice (IL-4-/-) are grossly impaired in (heir mucosal immune response to conventional protein antigens. In the present study we sought to understand the mechanisms responsible for the defecl in these miee. Wild type and IL-4 -/-mice were orally immunized with OVA together with cholera toxin (CT) adjuvant. Irrespective of the dose of antigen we failed to detect but poor anti-OVA local and s>slemic responses while anti-CT responses were roughly 50% cf those round in wild type mice Even when lL-4 -/-mice had already responded with high anti-OVA serum antibody liters afler i.v. immunization we could not elicit local anti-OVA IgA responses through oral immunizations. Further attempts to immunize perorally with OVA entrapped in microparticles failed. By contrast, if OVA was covalcntly coupled to CT strong responses were detected both systemically and in particular in gut lamina propria. Whereas only poor T cell priming in gut associated tissues was achieved with OVA given admixed with CT the conjugated form of OVA fully restored specific T cell priming as determined by proliferation and IFNy production Contrary to what has been proposed earlier CT acts in the absence of IL-4, and probably Th2-ce]]s, and uses an lL-4 ind^ndent pathway to stimulate gut mucosal immune responses. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily interacting with the integrins. This interaction is critical for leukocyte extravasation into inflamed tissue. The aim of this study was to assess the role of ICAM-1 in the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus septicemia and arhtritis. Method: Mutant mice, lacking the ICAM-1 gene, and normal wild-type congenes were intravenously injected with S. aureus strain LS-1. The animals were foltowed-up clinically during six days, regarding development of arthritis and mortality. Results: Six days after inoculation 50% of the animals in the ICAM-1 mutant group have died but none in the wild-type group. The mutants developed less severe arhritis than the wild-type animals. Histopathological examination of the lCAM-1 deficient mice displayed decreased erosive arthritis than in the controls. The sera from the mutants contained lower levels of IFN-ycompared to the congenes. This is in agreement with the m vitro data, where spleen cells from naive ICAM-1 deficient mice stimulated with TSST-1 and cell walls, produced lower levels of IFN-Y than spleen cells from healthy controls. Naive mutant mice had more circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes but lower number of cells capable of phagocytosis than the wild congenes. Conclusion: Mice lacking the ICAM-I gene exhibit higher mortality in S.aureiis arthritis than normal controls. Lower levels of IFN-Y production a\"^ lower number of phagocytizing ceils compared to the wild-type mice may contribute to this. However, decreased extravasation of leukocytes due to the lCAM-1 deficiency, leads to a less destructive course of septic arthritis in comparison with the wild littermates. MHC molecules and maybe most notably classll molecules are, depending on allcle. correlated with susceptibility or resistance to particular autoimmune diseases. In a model for Rheumatoid Arthritis that we study. Collagen Induced Arthritis, the susceptibility is strongly correlated with the Aq molecule. We have previously shown that an Ab'' transgene expressed on an H-T background makes resistant mice arthritic. We have noy/ extended this study andexpres.sed the transgene on BIO congenic strains of the H-T, H-2'. H-2\" and H-2'' haplotypes. Somewhat surprisingly the transgene is able to fonn a cell surlace expressed dimer with several of the endogenous alpha chains. All but Aa\" pair with Ap'' q to form cell surface dimers. We thus have more tools for studying the role of Ap** in restricting T eell response to self antigens. IgE antibodies specific for TNP are able to upregulate the antibody response to TNP-coupled carrierproteins via the low afftnity receptor tor IgE, CD23. In previous studies, the serum level of BSA-specific antibodies in mice given IgE + BSA-TNP was l(X)-fold higher, when measured in ELISA. as compared to tbat in control mice given antigen alone. In order to find out whether this difference was exclusively duetto affinity maturation or if there was an actual increase in the number of antibody producing cells, we used an ELISPOT assay which made it possible to detect the number of BSA specific cells in different lymphoid tissues. IgE antibodies induced significantly higher amounts of IgM-and IgG producing BSA-speeific cells in the spleen and the peak of the response was seen as early as five to six days after immunization. Furthermore, experimental parameters for lgE-mediated enhancement such as administration route, age and sex of the mice and hapteti density were investigated. IgE was found to enhance the response when antigen was given without adjuvants intravenously, intraperitoneally as well as subcutanously. The stimulation was independent of age and sex of the animals and required a low or medium coupling degree of bapten molecules to the carrier. Our findings show that IgE-induced responses are seen under several experimental conditions and that the B-cell response in spleen is upregulated very early after immunization. Patients with extrinsic allergic alveditis (EAA) have accumulations of T lymphocytes in their lungs, and CD8+ lung T cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of EAA. In this study we analyzed the T cell receptor (TCR) Va and Vp gene usage of CD4+ and CD8+ lung and peripheral blood (PBL) T lymphocytes. Materials and methods. 10 patienLs with clinical signs of EAA were studied (7 were exposed to mould; 3 to birds). From seven of these patients, samples were also available after elinical reeovery. Lung cells, obtained by bronchoalveoloar lavage (BAL), and paired PBL samples were analyzed by flow eytometry using a panel of anti-TCR V speeifie monoclonal antibodies. Results. 5/7 patients had expansions, restricted to the lung, of CD8+ T cells using a particular Va or Vp. with a normalized V gene usage on follow-up. In four patients minor expansions using the same Vp in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets were identified, suggesting a possible role for superantigens in this disease. Conclusion. In EAA we found most expansions, correlating with clinical activity, of T eells utilizing a partieular TCR Va or vp gene segment, to oceur in the lung CD8+ T cells. This further implicates these cells in the pathogenesis of EAA. We intend to procceed studying the functional role of CD8+ T cells in EAA by stimulating T cells with the relevant antigen in vitro. Vitamin A deficiency is associated with a 3-4 times higher incidence of infectious diseases and increased mortality in children in developing countries. Accordingly we have seen that vitamin A deficient rats, inoculated iv. with Staphylococcus aureus. develop septic arthritis with a 2 times higher frequency than ihe control rats. Since phagocytes play an important role in the defence against bacierial infections, we wanted to study if the function of those cells is influenced by vitamin A deficiency. Peripheral blood from vitamin A deficient and control rats was used to determine the percentage of phagocytic cells as well as Ihe phagocytosis activity per cell. This was done by measuring the number of fluureceinisothiocyanate liibelled bacteria ingested by granulocytes and monocytes. To determine Ihe capacity of intracellular killing of bacteria phagocytes from the peritoneal cavity of vitamin A deficient and conlrol rats were recovered and incubated with staphylococcus aureus for 24 hours. Thereafter Ihe cells were lysed and the incorporated bacteria cultured on horse blood agar plates. The percentage of phagocytic cells in the peripheral blotid of vitumin A deficienl rats was about 40 % higher (p = 0.001) and the number of bacteria ingested per cell 30 % higher in viiamin A deficient than in control rats. However, the intraceilutar killing capacity of the phagocyies from vitamin A deficient rats was significantly impaired (p = 0.02), since a higher number of bucteria remained alive in the phogocytes after 24 hour incubation. The results from our study show that the relative number of blood phagocytes is increased during vitamin A deficiency. The ingestion of bacteria by these cells is nol affected but Ihe ability to kill bacteria is impaired. This might be an important mechanism explaining the increased susceptibility to infections, respectively to septic arthritis during vitamin A deficiency.

To obtain a released form of human IL-1B. a signal sequence from the related IL-1 receptor antagonist was fused to the lL-lB encoding gene construct. A panel of murine cell lines was transduced with retroviral technique and analyzed for Ihe expression of IL-1B, with (ssIL-IBl or without (lL-lB) a signal sequence. Cell lines transduced with IL-IB contained large amounts of the IL-I6 protein i.e. whereas cells expressing sslL-lB .secreted most of the IL-16 protein.

This peptide is cnjciai for the affinity of pig to the epithelial secretory component (SC or pig receptor) and therefore plays a key role in secretory immunity.To define at which stage of B-cell differentiation J-chain expression starts we have characterized J-chain expression in several human B-cell lines representing different stages of differentiation. Northem blot analyses were used to screen for J-chain expression and quantitative PCR was established to quantify the copies of mRNA per cell. An intemal standard for the PCR reaction was constructed that utilizes the same primer pairs as the J-chain mRNA.The cell lines were phenotyped by How cytometry for surface markers including CD38 and the integrin 37 subunit, J chain was expressed in all cell lines except the pre-B-cell lines. This is in contrast to murine B cells where J chain is expressed only after activation. J-chain expression at the mRNA level was also detected in plasmacytoid B-cell lines that secrete IgG or IgE. The level of J-chain mRNA quantified by PCR ranged from 19000 to 350000 copies per cell. Protein and mRNA expression were well correlated. A new technique, liquid-liquid partition chromatography in an aqueous polyethylene glycol/dextran two-phase system, was used to analyse differences in surface properties of antibodies with different antigen-binding sites. Employing welt-characterized monoclonal IgG antibodies, intact as well as Fab/Fc fragments thereof, and chimeric IgG antibodies, we found a remarkable relationship between the structure of the antibody combining sites and the chromatographic behaviour of the antibodies. The surface properties of IgG antibodies are dominated by those of its antigen-binding regions. In addition, the constant parts of IgGl, 2 and 4 seemed to fotm similar scaffoldings, on to which CDRs of variable shapes and sizes are interspaced.",

The importance of the observed differences in surface properties/conformational changes are discussed. Reactive arthritis develops after certain gastrointestinal or urogenital infections in susceptible HLA-B27 positive individuals. Abnormal interaction between the causative microbes and the host is suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. We fed peripheral blood monocytes of healthy HLA-B27 positive persons with Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 and followed the expression of HLA-B27 on the cell surfaces using monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes of HLA-B27 molecule. We found that phagocytosis of Y. enterocolitica 0:3 induced changes in the expression of different epitopes of HLA-B27. This suggests that Y. enterocolitica O:3 altered the three-dimensional structure of HLA-B27 molecules. The modifications were in close proximity to the antigen binding cleft. The antigen presentation by modified HLA-B27 molecules may have a role in the pathogenesis of seronegative spondylarthropathies via impaired elimination of arthritis-triggering microbes or via an autoimmune mechanism.",

Laboratory of Lymphocyte Differentiation, Institute of Immunology, Moscow, Russia Fax:+7 095 1171027 Epithelial cell line HTSC from human thymus was produced. HTSC cells are large polymorphic cells with numerous cytoplasmic inclusions; they express cytoceratins and products of MHC classes I and II but lack or lytnphocyte and macrophague markers. Proliferation and secretory activity are absent in monocultres of HTSC. Addition of viable human thymocytes induces epithelial cell proliferation and secretion of al-thymosin and high-molecular factors with T-cell co-stimulatory activity. The secretion can be modulated by some hormones, cytokines and physical factors. Thymocytes adhere to HTSC cells and die by the mechanism of apoptosis during first day of co-culturing and then are eliminated. Human blood T cells and tnouse thymocytes are considerably less effective in inducing HTSC cell activation and resistant to apoptosis induction. The presence of idiotype-reactive T cell subsets and their relation to the tumor load were analyzed in 9 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), 12 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) clinical stage I and 9 patients with MM stage II/III. An enzyme-linked immunospot assay was used to identify interferon (IFN)-Y-, interleukin (IL)-2-or IL-4-secreting T cells after stimulation by F(ab')2 fragments of monoclonal IgG. The response to autologous IgG was significantly higher than that induced by isotypic monoclonal IgG. Comparable results were obtained in a proliferation assay (^H-thymidine incorporation), Eight of 9 patient.s with MGUS, 7 of 12 patients with MM .stage I and 3 of 9 with MM stage II/III had T cells secreting lFN-y and/or IL-2 (T helper [Th] type-1 cells), whereas ceils secreting both Thl and Th2 or ThO types of cytokines were more frequent in patients with MM, particularly in those with MM stage Il/m. The number and frequency of Thl-type cells were significantly higher in MGUS patients as compared to MM stage II/III. The T cell response was inhibited by an anti-DR antibody. The results indicate that idiotype-reactive T cells of the Thl and Th2 or ThO subsets were present in monoclonal gammopathies, and might provide indirect evidence that idiotype-reactive Thl-type cells may have a regulatory impact on the human tumor B cells. Experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) is an inflammatory demyeiinating disorder of the peripheral nervous system. It is a T cell mediated and cytokines including interferon-y (IFN-y) and transforming growth factor (TGF-B) are involved in the pathogenesis By adopting in situ hybridization, we studied the mRNA expression of immune response up-and down-regulating cytokines in EAN. IFN-y, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and the TGF-(J were examineded in the target organ, i.e. sciatic nerve, and in lymph nodes and spleen over the course of EAN, The dynamics of IFN-y mRNA expression in the sciatic nerve followed approximately the clinical course of EAN with peak values around day 14 post immunization (p.i), whereas IFN-y was transcribed earlier in spleen and lymph nodes with maximum on day 7 pi. On the contrary, transcription of IL-4 and TGF-fl was only slightly enhanced in EAN, with minor fluctuations in sciatic nerves peaking on days 11 and 28 pi. The highest numbers of TGF-fl mRNA positive cells in lymph nodes were observed during clinical improvement of EAN, The data argue for a major proinflammatory role for IFN-7 and a hypothetical disease downregulating (unctions for TGF-6 at the target site in EAN. We have previously demonstrated that staphylococcal enterotoxins contribute to the anhritis and mortality during staphylococcal infection. To further explore the relationship between staphylococcal superantigens and T cell responsiveness in the pathogenesis of hematogenic SEA producing S aureus infection we used TcR Vp3 transgenic (TGVp3) mice. TGVp3 mice and non-TG littermates were inoculated intravenously with S.attreus AB-1 strain producing a large amount of SEA, which specifically reacts with TcR Vp3. TGVp3 mice were highly susceptible to the acute bacterial infection. Within 9 days after inoculation, 85% of TGVp3 mice died compared with 31% of non-TG littermates (p<O.OI). The high mortality in TGVp3 mice was correlated with a significantly elevuted bacterial burden in blood, spleen and kidney. Flow cytometry analysis displayed that inoculation with SEA-producing bacteria resulted in an initial expansion and subsequent decrease of spleen Vp3+ CD4+ T lymphocytes in TGVp3 mice. The in vivo kinetics of cytokine mRNA expression was revealed by an in situ hybridization technique. No significant differences of TNFa, IL-ip, IL-4 and IL-IO mRNA expression were found between the groups following inoculation with S. aureus AB-1. However, a higher expression of TNFp in TGVj33 mice was noted throughout the course of infection compared with non-TG littermates. These findings suggest that overproduction of TNFp may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of septicemia caused by enterotoxin secreting 5. aureus.",

Fax: +46 46 19 11 34.Bacterial superantigens (SAg) are potent activators of T lymphocytes. To characterize potential MHC Class II binding sites in the SAg staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) we performed alanine substitution mutagenesis throughout the Cterminal part of and at selected sites in the N-lerminal domain. Three C-teiminal amino acid.s. H225, D227 and HI87, had a major influence on MHC Clas.s il binding and appeared to he involved in coordination of a Zn ion. Mutations at H225 and D227 resulted in more than a thou.sand-fold loss of MHC Clas.s II binding. Mutation at F47. which represents a N-terminal region homologous to the MHC Class II binding site previously demonstrated in the SAg SEB, resulted in 10-fold reduction of the MHC Class II binding. The mutants were found to retain an intact T cell receptor (TCR) epitope, as determined in a mAb targeted MHC Class II independent T cell cytotoxicity assay. A model is proposed in which the amino and carboxy terminal sites in SEA cooperate to form a high-affinily site, involving binding to iwo separate MHC Class II molecules. The present study implicates that SAg may bind monovalently or bivalently to MHC Class II molecules and possibly be presented to the TCR as dimeric or trimeric complexes.TH2 IMMUNE RESPONSE in P.falciparum MALARIA G.

Department of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Goteborg, S-41i3 46 Gbteborg, Sweden. Fax 46 31 82 67 91 Aim: To study estrogenic effects on lymphocyte migration to intiamed rheumatoid synovium. Method: Immunodeficient SCID mice were subcutaneously engrafted with .small pieces of synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recipient mice were treated with various doses of 17p-oestradio!, dexametason or eyelofosfamide. Three weeks later mice were Injected i.p. with 10'' freshly isolated ^'Cr labelled human lymphocytes. After 48 hours mice were sacrificed and the synovial graft as well as salivary glands were removed. The homing of labelled lymphocytes to synovial graft was evaluated in a y counter and expressed as cpm/mg tissue. Cell migration on single cell level was confirmed using autoradiographic technique on frozen tissue sections. Results: Synovial grafts in SCID mice treated with 17|Joestradiol displayed significantly (p<0.05) lower number of infiltared human lymphocytes compared with controls. In contrast, no reduction of lymphocyte migration was observed in synovial grafts of mice treated with cortisol or eyetofosfamide. None ofthe treatment regimens altered lymphocyte migration to murine salivary glands. Conclusion: Our study shows that estrogen has the capacity to selectively reduce the influx of lymphocytes into the inflamed human synovium. This finding could be of relevance for the understanding of the ameliorating effect of estrogen in human RA patients. Studies of the mechanjsm(s) by which estrogen inhibits lymphocyte homing is ongoing. IMMUNE RESPONSES AGAINST HOMOLOGOUS AND HETEROLOGOUS HEUCOBACTER PYWR!

The initial histopathological examination of the lymph nodes from these patients showed typical features of AILD, and there was no evidence of B cell monoclonality by lmmunophenotypical analysis. Southern blot analysis of the lymph nodes for gene rearrangements was positive for TcR gamma, and negative for IgH at the initial stageof AILD.however, those results of the gene rearrangements became inverse at the terminal stage of the lymphoma. Southern blot analysis of the B cell lymphoma for EBV was positive at their aggressive stage of the illness. But it was not detected in the lymph nodes by both Southern blot and PCR analysis at AILD stage. These observation suggest that EBV was not etiologically related to pathogenesis of AILD in our cases. Howeve, it might play important roles for development of B cell lymphoma from the EBV infected proliferating B cells under the sever immunodeficient states and/or some cytogenetic changes induced by intensive chemotherapy against AILD.CYTOKINE PRODUCTION BY PERIPHERAL BLOOD AND SYNOVIAL TISSUE CELLS IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) C.Trollmo, A.Tarkowski.

The individual course of the disease is very difficult to predict, the early course giving some clues to later deficits of motor function. Previous gastroentestinal infection by Campylobacter jejuni species has been associated directly with pathogenetic, immuno-inflamatory mechanisms of the disease, but is still only among highly varying events of both infections and unspecific episodes. 93 consecutively admitted patients fulfilling criteria for GBS have been retrospectively evaluated. 64 ptt.s did have severe course indicating PE. The 25 ptt. served as historical controls, 39 ptt had PE performed. Subgrouping according to episode I -3 weeks before paralysis started seemed to influence outcome of treatment, Speculations about possible mechanisms are presented. The interferon-a (IFN-a) producing blood leukocytes-, stimulated by Herpes simplex virus (HSV), lack markers of B-and T-cells as well as of monocytes and NK-cells. This so called natural IFN-a producing cells (NIPCs) do express CD4 and HLA-DR antigens, and may belong to the null-cell population. To further clarify the identity of NIPCs, and in particular their relationship to dendritic cells (DCs), a double labelling technique for simultaneous detection of intracellular IFN-a and expression of cell surface antigens was established.Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with HSV to produce IFN-a, fixed in paraformaldehyde and permeabilized. The cells were then stained with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reactive with various cell surface antigens and with mAbs to IFN-a, and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM).Previous phenotypic characterizations of HSV-stimulated NIPCs were confirmed, and in addition the NIPCs were found to be positive for the CD40, CD44 and CD45RA antigens, but negative for FCERI and B7-2.Further, the ability of NIPCs to stimulate antigen-specific T-cell responses were tested. The PBMCs were stimulated with HSV, fixed and stained for intracellular IFN-a. The NIPCs were sorted with FCM, and shown to stimulate the proliferation of autologous T-cells from HSV-immune, but not non-immune, donors.In conclusion, NIPCs resemble but are not identical to DCs, and have the ability to present antigens to immune T-ceils.",

Departments of Clinical Immunology, Neurology and Radiology, University of Gbteborg. Sweden. The aim of the present study was to investigate pattems of local inflammatory responses as a consequence of acute stroke. Methods: Thirty stroke patients wet^ studied prospectively on days 0-3. 7, 21, and 90 with clinical evaluations, radiological asessments and analysis of serum and cerehrospinal lluid (CSF) cytokine levels. Results: Significantly increased levels of IL-6 in CSF (p<0,001) were observed in virtually all the stroke patients studied compared to healthy controls. This increase was observed during the whole observation time but was significantly more pronounced within the first days after the stroke onset with a peak level on days 2 and 3. This initial increase was significantly correlated {R=0,65; p=0,002) with the volume of infarct measured by MR 1-2 months later. Serum levels of IL-6 were significantly lower these of CSF (p=0,013) and did not display any significant correlation to the size of the brain lesion. Also, increase of intrathecal but not systemic IL-lp levels was observed early during the stroke. Conclusion: An intrathecal production of IL-6 and IL-lp in patients with stroke is demonstrated, supporting the notion of localized inflammatory response to the acute brain lesion. The significant correlation between early intratheca! production of IL-",
