SARS-CoV-2 is the agent responsible for the COVID-19, it is a beta coronavirus of group 2B with over 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV-1 [2]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not an uncommon complication when disease can\u2019t be controlled[3], the percentage of patients requiring ARDS treatment is about 10% for those who are actively infected. Total white blood count, lymphocytes, and platelets are lower than the average with extended activated thromboplastin time, increased C-reactive protein and muscle enzyme level. Lymphocytes decrease with diseases progression. Secretion of cytokine, such as IL1B, IL1RA, IL6, IL7, IL8, known as cytokine storm, is associated with disease severity[3], [4].Fig 1.\n",

If that is the case, targeting the coronavirus alone with antiviral therapy might not be sufficient to reverse highly pathogenic infections[5]. These observations led to explore the usage of therapies that included interferons type I and II. Interferon beta displayed the best efficacy in reducing MERS-CoV replication in tissue culture[6], [7]. A randomized control trial is ongoing in South Arabia (MIRACLE Trial) to determine whether the combination of antivirals used in HIV infection such as Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon beta could improve clinical outcomes in MERS-CoV infections [8]. In a humanized transgenic mouse MERS-CoV infection model, Remdesivir (a drug already being used against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with severe and moderate disease, GS-US-540-5773/4 Studies) showed more activity and efficacy in prophylactic and therapeutic use then the combination of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon beta[9], this points towards the necessity to explore other options regarding immune system modulation and how control of viraemia is also essential.",

This shows how IL-6 limits influenza-induced inflammation and protects against lung damage[17] by promoting neutrophil survival in the lung [16]. IL-6 crucial role is not limited to influenza but also in other infections such as Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) infection where IL-6 deficient mice shows an increase in infection susceptibility[18]. In other scenarios, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections in mice, early depletion of IL-6, but not late, resulted in significant increase of the disease with an associated influx of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells[19].",

Especially IL-6 can induce the hyper-innate inflammatory response due to the SARS-CoV-1 invasion of the respiratory tract[20]. Interestingly, in human epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-1 was able to induce greater IL-6 when compared to influenza A virus[21]. Although in some murine viral infections IL-6 plays a protective and essential role in the resolution process, in others like in SARS-CoV-1 high levels of IL-6 were associated with severe inflammation and correlated with mortality in the mice[22], [23]. This happens also with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients: some retrospective and meta-analysis studies show how elevated IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) correlate with mortality and severe disease in comparison to moderate disease[24], [25], [26], [27]. More evidence suggests that critically ill patients with severe respiratory failure and SARS-CoV-2 have either immune dysregulation or macrophage-activation syndrome, both of which are characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokines. The immune dysregulation, in particular, is driven by the Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and not by Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)[27]. Two key features of this immune dysregulation are: over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes and lymphocyte dysregulation with CD4 lymphopenia[27].",

Moreover, it was shown how SARS-CoV-1 has the ability of inducing production of compounds like oxidized phospholipid (OxPL) both in humans and animals. OxPLs in turn induce cytokine production and acute lung injury via Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4)[28]. This is evidence of SARS-CoV-1 ability to indirectly induce acute lung injury and cytokine production, like that of IL-6[28], [29]. TLR4 is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the pattern recognition receptor family (PRR family), it recognizes molecules like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) thanks to an accessory protein known as MD-2[30]. TLRs activate transcription factors like NFkB, AP-1 and IRF inducing proinflammatory cytokines expressions and Interferon 1[31], [32], [33]. TLR4 is associated not only with infections but also with tissue damage, and this damage-dependent pathway may be amplified in the acute stages of the infection. Of note, TLR4-null mice are highly resistant to infection by the mouse adapted influenza A virus[34]. Protection against influenza infections in mouse models was shown to be achieved by targeting TLR4 with antagonists or with specific anti-receptor antibodies[35]. Another option in targeting host inflammatory response could then be targeting the cellular toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4). Furthermore, TLR4 seems to regulate IL-6 secretion through the NFkB pathway[36]. This again points towards excessive activation of the innate immune response. Another proof of that is the damage shown to the pulmonary interstitial arteriolar walls that is more associated with the inflammatory response rather than the pathogenic effect of coronaviruses[37].",

Among all SARS-CoV-1 structural proteins (nucleocapsid N, spike S, envelop E and membrane M) only the nucleocapsid protein (N) significantly induced the activation of IL-6 promoter in human airway epithelial cell cultures[38]. IL-6 gene expression is activated by the N protein which binds to the NF-kB regulatory element on IL-6 promoter and facilitates its translocation from cytosol to nucleus. The N protein is essential for IL-6 secretion to happen, since deletion of the C-terminus of the N protein resulted in the loss of function in the activation of IL-6[38].",

The complex formed by IL-6 and its receptor in turn activates a homodimer of the signal transduction beta-receptor gp130 with high affinity[44]. The gp130 receptor thereupon dimerizes and initiates intracellular signal transduction by activating the JAK/STAT and ras/MAP kinase pathways[45]. Gp130 is expressed on all cells of the human body. IL-6 Receptor instead is mainly found on hepatocytes, some leukocytes, and epithelial cells[46]. The IL-6 Receptor (IL-6R) protein is subjected to limited proteolysis by a metalloprotease activity which gives rises to a soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R)[47]. The majority of the soluble IL-6R found in the circulation is proteolytically cleaved from cells by the protease ADAM17[48], [49]. A minor portion of the sIL-6R is generated from an alternatively spliced mRNA[50], but limited proteolysis remains the major mechanism by which the sIL-6R is generated[51].",

Some animal models showed that when IL-6 was acting via the membrane bound IL-6R (classic signaling) it did so in a protective way, they also showed that inhibiting trans-signaling was superior to global blockade of IL-6 activity by neutralizing antibodies[56], this was done using the IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor sgp130Fc, which is a fusion protein of the gp130 with the Fc portion of a human immunoglobulin antibody[57], [58]. In a murine polymicrobial sepsis model, selective blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling with sgp130Fc improved survival up to 100%. Interestingly, treating these mice with anti-IL-6R antibodies did not prevent death of the mice[56]. This is a first hint of how targeting only the IL-6R with drugs like Tocilizumab might not be enough in a sepsis infectious model. Furthermore, it all points to the trans-signaling transduction being the harmful one (pro-inflammatory response), and the classic signaling transduction being the protective one (anti-inflammatory response)[59]. More evidence of that in some studies showing that elevated serum levels of IL-6, which are a marker of disease severity in the inflammatory acute lung injury during acute pancreatitis, were mediated by the trans-signaling transduction way, as sgp130Fc blocked the pancreatitis induced acute lung injury[60]. Moreover in a mouse model of atherosclerosis sgp130Fc showed to reduce disease and showed significant regression of the atherosclerotic plaques, thus underlying the pro-inflammatory role of the trans-signaling pathway once more[61]. The sgp130Fc protein was shown not to interfere with IL-6 signaling via the membrane-bound IL-6R (mIL6-R). In contrast, IL-6 trans-signaling is completely blocked both in vitro and in vivo by the sgp130Fc protein[46]. Higher levels of the soluble IL-6 receptor(sIL-6R) are usually found in chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer[55], in multiple myeloma for example high sIL-6R levels were correlated with poor survival[62], sIL6R levels are also higher in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphomas[63]. Locally increased sIL-6R concentrations were also found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) of asthmatics[64], and in malignant ascites from ovarian cancer patients, where it was associated with poor prognosis[65].",

Furthermore this defense is not affected by the selective blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling[70], [71]. In the animal model of listeriosis global blockade of IL-6 led to a dramatic increase in bacterial titers in spleen and liver. In contrast, selective blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling with the sgp130Fc protein did not result in increased bacterial titers, and thus was concluded that the classic signaling was involved in the protection of the body from bacterial infection[71].",

It has been shown that the blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling using sgp130Fc was as efficient as the global blockade of IL-6 classic and trans-signaling using specific monoclonal antibodies[72]. SGP130Fc is mainly used in chronic inflammatory diseases (such as intestinal inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, neuroinflammation and cancer[51]), but it has shown its efficacy also in acute inflammation[57] and sepsis[73], where selective blockade of interleukin-6 trans-signaling improved survival in a murine polymicrobial sepsis model[56]. An infection where the inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling has shown its efficacy is Malaria, another infection during which IL-6 levels correlate with the severity of the disease. In a murine model of IL-6R deficient mice the infection showed an increase in survival of otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria. Inducing IL-6 trans-signaling by injection of mouse recombinant soluble IL-6R in deficient mice restores the lethal outcome. In contrast, inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling via injection of sgp130Fc protein in wild type mice results in 40% survival rate. This demonstrate that trans-signaling, rather than classic signaling, contributes to malaria lethality in mice[74].",

The signal transfer is performed by the Janus-kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT)-,mainly STAT1, STAT3 isoforms[78], [79], [80], mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)- and phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-pathway[44], [77].

Ruxolitinib is a small drug belonging to the class of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and currently clinically used in the treatment of JAK2 mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms, including myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera[81], [82]. It shows activity against the JAK2 isoform and also the JAK1 isoform, which plays a major role in the signaling pathway of inflammatory cytokines[83]. JAK3 seems to be less sensitive to ruxolitinib[84], it also shows anti-inflammatory activity which may be beneficial in its clinical use[85]; it is also implicated in the suppression of the harmful consequences of macrophage activation hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis[86], which is an under-recognized hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia with multi organ failure[87]. It has been proven that the expression of major inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alfa and IL6 was highly reduced in inflammatory human macrophages exposed to ruxolitinib[85]. It has also been shown through an analysis of mRNA expression of cytokines by PCR array that the major inflammatory cytokines , IL-6 and TNF alfa, were highly reduced and down-regulated by ruxolitinib at both protein and mRNA level[88]. All these results point towards a possible use of Ruxolitinib as an IL-6 inhibitor like Tocilizumab in the advanced stages of COVID-19. This drug is currently being tested in some patients in Italy (CINC424, RUXOLITINIB).",

It targets members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family (AAK1 and GAK), the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro[91]. It can be administered orally and has acceptable side effect profile, besides having little interaction with CYP enzymes and drug transporters[89].
