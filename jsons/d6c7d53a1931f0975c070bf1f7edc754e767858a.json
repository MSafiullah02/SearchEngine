Enterobacterales, formerly Enterobacteriaceae, have developed resistance mechanisms to carbapenems that leave very few antimicrobial options in the clinician's armamentarium. Recent Findings New antimicrobials like ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, cefiderocol, and plazomicin have the potential to overcome resistance mechanisms in Enterobacterales including different classes of carbapenemases. Summary Novel \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, plazomicin, and cefiderocol give the clinician options that were once not available. Utilizing these options is of the utmost importance when treating carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.",

With increasing exposures to antimicrobials, organisms that were once easily treatable now harbor mechanisms of resistance that leave few treatment options for clinicians. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, formerly known as Enterobacteriaceae, are a group of organisms that are among the most difficult to treat; therefore, it is no surprise that the CDC considers them to be one of the top three most urgent threats with resistance spreading rapidly in the USA and throughout the world [2] . As of 2018, the CDC has reported at least one type of carbapenemase in all 50 states, and rarer genotypic expressions are becoming more common [3] . Prior to the introduction of novel \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors with activity against carbapenemase producers, mortality rates varied from 24% to as high as 74% [4, 5] . It is imperative that clinicians understand definitions of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), local resistance patterns, and how to optimize treatment based on infection site.",

            "text": "There are major oversights when discussing carbapenemresistant organisms (CRO) or CREs. For one, CRE's simplified definition of Enterobacterales resistant to carbapenems does an injustice to the complexities of developed mechanisms of resistance [6] . Combinations of extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL), overexpression of ampC and loss of porin channels may confer resistance to ertapenem but meropenem or imipenem may remain active [7] [8] [9] . While considered to be CRE using conventional definitions, these non-carbapenemase-producing organisms may be amenable to high-dose carbapenem therapy and do not pose the same potential for transmissibility due to their lack of plasmid conferred resistance [10] . In contrast to these non-carbapenemaseproducing organisms, it is important to delineate if CRE are carbapenemase producers as differing enzymes will have variable phenotypic profiles to commercially available antimicrobials as well as a high degree of transmissibility due to their plasmid-mediated resistance profiles. OXA-48, a serine-based carbapenemase, may hydrolyze carbapenems, yet ceftazidime and cefepime will retain activity if no other mechanisms of resistance are expressed [11, 12] . Isolates may and often have additional mechanisms of resistance included with carbapenemase. Additional subtleties with carbapenem resistance occur demonstrating the need for more specific terminology. Moreover, the likelihood of different types of resistance varies between geographical regions. North America and Israel tend to have a higher prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) whereas metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL) can be found in India, Italy, and Greece [7, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . OXA carbapenemases are endemic to Europe, Northern Africa, and the Middle East [7, 11, 12, 14] . A potential treatment option for a KPC may not necessarily treat an MBL and can be overlooked using broad terminology like CRE. Table 1 highlights different groups and classifications of \u03b2-lactamase including potential carbapenemase producers.",

The preferable pharmacokinetics and decreased risk of AKI often make polymyxin B the preferred polymyxin for non-urinary systemic infections [19, 20, 25] . A loading dose of 2.0-2.5 mg/kg of total body weight followed by a maintenance dose of 1.25-1.5 mg/kg of total body weight divided into 2 dose 12 h apart is recommended without renal dosage adjustment [25, 26] . Neither parental polymyxin B nor colistin achieve adequate lung concentration and are suboptimal choices for the treatment of respiratory infection as monotherapy [19] . The polymyxins should generally be given in combination with another susceptible or synergistic antimicrobial when treating CRE due to the high potential for failure, variable pharmacokinetics, and development of resistance observed on monotherapy. As novel therapies active against carbapenemase-producing organisms become more widely available, the use of polymyxins as the backbone of treatment for CRE should subside and the role of these agents should be reserved as salvage therapy when all other options have been exhausted.",

Aminoglycosides can play a crucial role in CRE because their mechanism of action is not affected by carbapenemases; however, many CRE organisms harbor aminoglycoside modification enzymes (AME) [29, 30] . As such, the therapeutic role of conventional aminoglycosides, like gentamicin and amikacin, can be highly variable based on the widespread geographic distribution of AMEs.",

A phase III trial (CARE study) attempted to demonstrate efficacy of plazomicin combination therapy compared with polymyxin combination therapy for a multitude of carbapenemresistant Enterobacterales infections [34] .

Fifteen patients who received plazomicin combination therapy were further evaluated to determine if adequate concentrations of each drug were achieved [35] .

Plazomicin blood samples were collected 10 h post dose to determine an appropriate dosing interval based on the Hartford nomogram. Afterwards, the information was simulated to predict toxic trough concentrations greater than 3 mg/L and an efficacious interval-normalized AUC.

Bulik and Nicolau proposed the use of combination ertapenem and high-dose doripenem or meropenem as a method to combat CRE [38] . The theoretical mechanism uses ertapenem as a suicide molecule with high affinity for KPC enzymes, allowing meropenem or doripenem to treat the organism. Both their in vitro model and murine thigh model demonstrated bacterial reduction with a roughly 3 log and 1 log reduction, respectively. Clinical studies and case reports have also demonstrated an increase in microbiological cure and a decrease in all-cause mortality compared with other options like polymyxins [39] [40] [41] [42] . While the clinical utility of double carbapenem therapy has demonstrated in patients with CRE, it is important to recognize that the efficacy of this regimen is restricted to KPC-based infections. Enterobacterales. Ceftazidime-avibactam (Avycaz\u00ae), meropenem-vaborbactam (Vabomere\u00ae), and the new BL/ BLI imipenem-relebactam (Recarbrio\u00ae) have brought welcomed treatment options to clinicians treating these MDR organisms. It is important to note that these drugs do not all cover the same carbapenemase.

Their single-center retrospective study looked at treatment failure with ceftazidime-avibactam and found that 60% of clinical failures were treated for pneumonia compared with 29% of successes (p = 0.045, OR 3.09, 1.03-9.34). Similar success and failure trends were seen with continuous renal replacement therapy at 7% and 37% respectively (p = 0.046, OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.03-22.2). This raises the question whether resistance and treatment failure were observed because of inappropriate dosing in these critically ill patients. This controversy with ceftazidime-avibactam highlights that it is crucial that patients receiving these novel BL/BLIs are aggressively dosed with optimal exposures to achieve clinical cure.",

In vitro and animal models show efficacy with imipenem-relebactam, and it has recently been approved for complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . Motsch and colleagues recently published a randomized controlled trial comparing imipenem-relebactam to imipenem and colistin for imipenem non-susceptible bacterial infections [67] . Out of the 31 modified microbiologic intent to treat population, a majority of isolates were P. aeruginosa, (77%) followed by Klebsiella spp. (16%) and other Enterobacterales (6%). Imipenem-relebactam was considered non-inferior for microbiological cure (71%) compared with imipenem and colistin (70%) and had a significant 28-day favorable response (71% vs. 40%, 90% CI 1.3-51.5). The authors further described a non-significant reduced 28-day all-cause mortality of 10% with imipenem-relebactam compared with 30% of imipenem and colistin subjects. Notably, CRE specific data demonstrated only one out of four carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales showing a microbiological cure compared with one out of one imipenem and colistin treated subject. Authors attributed microbiologic failure of imipenem-relebactam to organisms harboring several group A and C extended \u03b2-lactamases. The therapeutic niche of imipenem-relebactam remains unclear as it may be used as an additional option for CRE or it may be more useful in treating multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa including those producing carbapenemases [62] . Similarly to ceftazidime-avibactam, the additional pseudomonal coverage may make imipenem-relebactam an appropriate option for empiric therapy in a septic patient with high risk of CRE and pseudomonal infection. Unlike the two previously approved \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors which are recommended to have each dose administered over 2-3 h, imipenem-relebactam is given via a 30-min infusion. Shorter infusion durations may be advocated in some institutional settings.",

The USA lags behind a majority of other countries as oral fosfomycin is the only formulation available at this moment; however, an IV formulation is currently under development [81] . Fosfomycin will likely be combined with additional agents for its additive and synergistic effects. Avery and colleagues evaluated combination fosfomycin against various CPE isolates using the E-test method [82] . Fosfomycin had no antagonism against any tested antimicrobial and had at least one isolate that was additive making it a potential option for treating multidrug-resistant organisms.",

            "text": "The treatment of a non-metallo carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales with monotherapy or combination has been a topic of interest for many clinicians now that novel \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors have been introduced into clinical practice. Historically, the high mortality rates of polymyxins due to poor microbiologic potency and less than optimal drug exposures that have been limited by toxicity have mandated the use of combination therapy in severely ill patients. A large retrospective cohort study evaluated the treatment of bloodstream infections either with monotherapy or combination therapy [83] . Three hundred forty-three subjects were stratified into groups based on severity of illness with a primary endpoint of overall mortality. There were no statistical differences among combined cohorts (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53-1.08) and the low mortality score cohort (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.62-2.23); however, subjects identified as a high risk of mortality had a statistically significant decrease in overall mortality (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.39-0.93). It is important to note the above study did not include novel therapies like BL/BLIs which should take over as the mainstay of CPO therapy. The shift away from using nephrotoxic agents with unpredictable pharmacokinetics has reopened the debate of which agent is superior. There is a growing amount of literature demonstrating ceftazidimeavibactam, imipenem-relebactam, and meropenemvaborbactam lead to better treatment outcomes with less adverse events compared with polymyxin best available therapy regimens [49, 52-54, 58, 67] . A summary comparing BL/BLI therapy to traditional colistin-based therapy can be seen in Table 3 . If an organism is susceptible to a novel \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2lactamase inhibitor, then that agent may be considered for monotherapy because these compounds have demonstrated efficacy in the setting of severe infections. Even with novel agents demonstrating superiority over colistin, prescribing habits are slow to change. A recent publication by Clancy and colleagues show that polymyxin and colistin are still the most prescribed antimicrobials for CRE infections which is Fig. 1 Algorithm for the empiric therapy of the critically ill septic patient. Choose empiric coverage based on patient specific factors, local epidemiology, and concordant resistance. ABX, antimicrobial, CRO, carbapenem-resistant organism deeply concerning [84] . Gaining access to novel agents to treat CRE should be a priority for all clinicians as these \u03b2lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors have been shown to improve outcomes and reduced toxicities relative to polymyxin-based regimens.",

A prospective observational cohort study conducted by Gianella and colleagues evaluated risk factors for development of CRE bloodstream infection from previously colonized subjects and found ICU admission, invasive abdominal procedures, chemotherapy/radiation, and multiple CRE colonization sites independently increased risk [85] . Another study conducted in Israel demonstrated that clinically significant increased risks in carbapenem-resistant colonized patients developing infection were treated with antipseudomonal penicillins [86] . In an effort to maximize the probability of early appropriate therapy in patients at risk for resistant pathogens, clinicians need to become increasingly comfortable with the antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetic and toxicodynamic profiles of the novel therapies discussed so that optimal empiric therapy can be initiated at the onset of infection (Fig. 1) . Unfortunately a single source of antimicrobial susceptibility data for the agents included in this review is not available and thus comparative assessments based on percent susceptible collated from multiple sources are potentially misleading for CRE due to differing genotypic profiles across the globe. As such, these challenges highlight the importance of local susceptibility testing to determine the most suitable agent(s) for clinical practice in any given region. While the use of novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be warranted in the setting of initial empirical therapy for the septic patient, great effort should be taken to utilize the available diagnostic techniques (i.e., invasive sampling strategies, molecular tests) to identify the causative pathogen(s) and thus allow a rapid, narrow targeted approach to treatment.",
