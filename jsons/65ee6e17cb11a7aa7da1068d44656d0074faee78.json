It is the etiologic agent of bovine tritrichomonosis, a sexually transmitted disease in extensively managed herds throughout many geographic regions worldwide. The same trichomonad species is also regarded as the causative agent of chronic diarrhea in the domestic cat, although more recent studies observed molecular differences between bovine-and feline-derived T. foetus. Trichomonosis in cats has a worldwide distribution and is mainly present among cats from high-density housing environments. Other trichomonads are found as inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract in birds, such as Trichomonas gallinae. Particularly, Columbiformes, Falconiformes, Strigiformes, and wild Passeriformes can be severely affected by avian trichomonads. Diagnosis of trichomonosis is often complicated by the fragility of the parasite. To ensure valid test results, it is essential to collect and handle specimens in the right way prior to analysis. Cultivation tests, the specific amplification of parasites, or a combination of both test methods is the most efficient and most commonly used way to diagnose trichomonosis in animals. Bovine tritrichomonosis is mainly controlled by the identification and withdrawal of infected animals from bovine herds. The control of feline and avian trichomonosis relies mainly on preventive measures.",

It is located in the urogenital tract of cattle and considered the etiologic agent of bovine tritrichomonosis, a sexually transmitted disease throughout many geographic regions worldwide (Bondurant 2005; Ondrak 2016 ). The same trichomonad species was initially described in 1999 and finally confirmed in 2003 to be the causative agent of chronic diarrhea in the domestic cat (Gookin et al. 1999; Levy et al. 2003) . Trichomonosis in cats has a worldwide distribution and is mainly present among cats from high-density housing environments such as catteries, shelters, or breeding facilities (Yao and K\u00f6ster 2015) . Other trichomonads in animals, for example, Tritrichomonas suis in swine-presumably genetically identical to T. foetus of bovine origin-are commensals and rarely involved in disease. T. suis was once thought to cause atrophic rhinitis in pigs, further studies were not able to establish a causal relationship, and T. suis is now considered a harmless nasal and gastrointestinal commensal in swine (BonDurant and Honigberg 1994) . Isolates of T. suis that reside in the stomach, caecum, and nasal cavity of pigs are not of clinical significance to their porcine hosts (Fitzgerald et al. 1958; Hibler et al. 1960; Pakandl 1994; Mostegl et al. 2011) .",

However, molecular identity of the enteric trichomonads observed in these dogs was not investigated, and the relevance for dogs is not clear.

However, there appears to be no association between T. foetus infection in cats and reported exposure to cattle ). There is an ongoing debate whether T. foetus from cattle and cats should be placed into separate species. A molecular separation of feline and bovine isolates of T. foetus based on a number of gene loci-summarized by Yao and K\u00f6ster (2015) -seems to be possible, but on the transcriptomic level, a separation remains difficult (Reinmann et al. 2012; Slapeta et al. 2010 Slapeta et al. , 2012 Sun et al. 2012; Morin-Adeline et al. 2014 , 2015b . There is evidence that T. foetus isolates from cats and cattle show differences in pH tolerance (Sect. 14.2.2), and T. foetus from cats are able to survive a passage through the alimentary tract of slugs (Morin-Adeline et al. 2015a ; Van der Saag et al. 2011 ). Thus, some authors believe that feline T. foetus represents a different species, and a change in name-to T. blagburni-has been proposed (Walden et al. 2013) . It has been hypothesized that feline T. foetus has extended its host range into the bovine reproductive tract (Morin-Adeline et al. 2015a). The picture becomes even more complicated because T. foetus isolated from cattle seems to be morphologically and genetically identical to Tritrichomonas suis, that is, a commensal observed in the nasal cavity, stomach, cecum, and colon of the domestic pig (Felleisen 1998; Hampl et al. 2001; Tachezy et al. 2002; Reinmann et al. 2012; Slapeta et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2012) . Consequently, it was assumed that T. suis and T. foetus belong to the same species (Tachezy et al. 2002; Lun et al. 2005; Frey and M\u00fcller 2012; Yao and K\u00f6ster 2015) . However, more recent epidemiological studies suggest that cross-species transmission from pigs to cattle on the same farm-e.g., by exposure to T. foetuscontaminated pig feces-is unlikely to occur (Mueller et al. 2015) .",

The cytoplasm contains a series of support elements, including the pelta-axostyle complex, the costal fiber bordering the recurrent flagellum, and the parabasal apparatus. These elements together with the flagellum make up the cytoskeleton (Benchimol 2005) . The axostyle originates in the same area of the birth of the flagellum-surrounded at this point by a chromatin ring-and is directed toward the back of the parasite, making prominence at the posterior end. The pelta is a semilunar structure, very little developed, located in the anterior part of the axostyle. Both structures form the pelta-axostyle complex-composed of groups of connected microtubules-forming a kind of slit that houses the nucleus and parabasal bodies (Benchimol 2004 (Benchimol , 2005 . In T. foetus, the axostyle has two functions; it serves as a support organelle and participates in the processes of cell division, allowing the constriction of the nuclei during the karyokinesis (Ribeiro et al. 2002) . The costa is a rigid structure that sits on the inner margin of the undulating membrane and serves as a support. The parabasal filaments are also filaments striped perpendicularly, and their mission seems to support the parabasal body-i.e., the Golgi complex. The parabasal filaments and the parabasal body constitute the parabasal apparatus, located in the anterior part of the cell (Benchimol 2004 (Benchimol , 2005 . T. foetus has a simple anterior nucleus and hydrogenosomes, which appear as electro-dense corpuscles that act as functional substitutes for mitochondria. Other cellular components that can be observed in the cytoplasm are free ribosomes, polysomes, glycogen granules, vesicles, and vacuoles related to processes of endocytosis, digestion, and transport (Benchimol 2004 (Benchimol , 2005 . Under unfavorable conditions, such as a low concentration of nutrients, the presence of certain drugs such as griseofulvin, or abrupt changes in temperature, trophozoites internalize the flagellum and acquire a form of pseudocyst, which is not surrounded by a manifest cell wall (Pereira-Neves and Benchimol 2009) .",

Like other trichomonads that inhabit body cavities, T. foetus feeds mainly on bacteria, whose proliferation depends on the environment conditions where the parasite is based (Petrin et al. 1998) . From the metabolic point of view, T. foetus is unable to de novo synthesize purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, as well as complex phosphoglycerides or cholesterol. The parasite obtains its energy through the anaerobic catabolism of carbohydrates, although the trichomonads are able to survive in the presence of oxygen. As already noted, trichomonads lack mitochondria but possess hydrogenosomes that produce molecular hydrogen in anaerobiosis and reduce oxygen. In this way, the parasite manages to keep the pH of its environment close to neutrality favoring its own development (Kleydman et al. 2004 ).",

The parasite divides by longitudinal binary fission in which the nuclear membrane persists-a type of mitosis referred to as cryptopleuromitosis. In addition, when compared to the trophozoite form, pseudocysts present a different mitosis model, since they first divide the nuclei without dividing their cytoplasm, leading to the formation of multinucleated polymastigotes that persist if the cells are maintained under conditions of stress. When the environmental conditions are again favorable, flagella are externalized, and the new flagellated trophozoites emerge from the multinucleated cells (Pereira-Neves and Benchimol 2009).",

T. gallinarum is commonly found in the large intestine of gallinaceous and anseriform birds, yet its role in causing disease either in naturally infected chickens and turkeys or via experimental infection is under discussion (Amin et al. 2014) . T. gallinae trophozoites have an ovoidal to pyriform shape with a size of about 7-11 \u03bcm. They are provided with four free anterior flagella and a fifth recurrent one, which does not become free at the posterior pole as it extends for only two-thirds of the body length (Tasca and De Carli 2003; Mehlhorn et al. 2009 ). Trophozoites of T. gallinarum appear mostly pear shaped and range in size from 6 to 15 \u03bcm (Clark et al. 2003) . They also have four free anterior flagella and a fifth recurrent one, which becomes free at the posterior pole. Another difference to T. gallinae is the occurrence of a sphere of lacunes of the endoplasmic reticulum surrounding in a regular distance the nucleus with its typical perinuclear membranes. Furthermore, the food vacuoles appear to be very large (Mehlhorn et al. 2009 ).",

This epithelium undergoes numerous folds-resulting in a greater development of crypts-where T. foetus can develop properly by providing a suitable microenvironment for facultative or microaerophilic anaerobic microorganisms (Rhyan et al. 1999) . Infection may persist for the life of the bull, in spite of the presence of a measurable humoral immune response in the preputial cavity (Rhyan et al. 1999; Campero et al. 1990; Flower et al. 1983 ).",

Trophozoites would adhere to the hair of the animals and could be ingested during grooming Tolbert and Gookin 2009 ). The viability of the parasite in the environment is limited though it can withstand several days at room temperature facilitating its transmission (Hale et al. 2009 ). T. foetus-contaminated food and less likely water may be also a relevant route for transmission. Further, shedding of viable T. foetus has been demonstrated in some slug species, which were fed cat food spiked with trophozoites of a feline T. foetus isolate, suggesting that invertebrates like slugs could play a role as mechanical vectors (Van der Saag et al. 2011).",

Other species within the Columbiformes, Falconiformes, Strigiformes, and, most recently, different Passeriformes have been recognized as potential hosts (Forrester and Foster 2008; Robinson et al. 2010 gallinaceous birds like turkeys and chickens (Levine and Brandly 1939) . The preferred site for T. gallinae is the upper digestive tract including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and crop, with the parasite rarely found posterior to the proventriculus (Cauthen 1936) . Transmission by direct contact seems to be the most efficient route to establish an infection-e.g., via the crop milk from infected parent birds to the nestlings during feeding (Stabler 1954) . In adult pigeons, the infection can occur during courtship while raptors can be infected from prey animals carrying the parasite. The infection of turkeys and chickens happens mainly via drinking water contaminated by pigeons (BonDurant and Honigberg 1994) . Trichomonas gallinae is unable to form true cysts, even though cyst-like stages-pseudocysts-have been reported (Tasca and De Carli 2003; Mehlhorn et al. 2009 ). These pseudocysts may provide another route of transmission and an environmentally resistant stage during unfavorable conditions. Tetratrichomonas gallinarum locates in the intestinal tract of different poultry species including chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, quails, ducks, and geese and can be transmitted via consumption of contaminated food (BonDurant and Honigberg 1994) . Pseudocysts of T. gallinarum have been reported in vivo and in vitro possibly protecting the parasite during fecal-oral transmission (Mehlhorn et al. 2009 ).",

The preferred location is in the cervix and cervicovaginal mucus, but the number of parasites varies throughout the estrus cycle, being higher in the days prior to estrus. The establishment of the parasite in the genital tract of the female does not seem to interfere with the fertilization nor with the early development of the embryo (Bielanski et al. 2004 ). In heifers experimentally infected with T. foetus, conceptus deaths peaked at 50-70 days of gestation (Parsonson et al. 1976 ). Occasional abortions of fetuses older than 4-month gestational age are reported, but typically losses occur 2 months earlier (Bondurant 2005) . The infection in the female is usually self-limiting, disappearing between 2 and 4 months after the loss of the conceptus. The immunity that develops is not permanent and usually lasts for about 6 months; after 6 months, the female is again susceptible to infection. Carrier cows-these are cows that remain infected for at least 10 months-seem to fail to develop a protective immune reaction against T. foetus. Notable lesions in the maternal endometrium and fetal envelopes have been described only at the time of fetal loss (Parsonson et al. 1976 ).",

Pathogenesis of T. foetus on the intestinal epithelial cells has been suggested to be both contact-dependent and contact-independent. In the former, a cytopathic effect is mainly exerted via apoptosis induced by cell-associated proteases, whereas extracellular proteases are the major players in contact-independent cytotoxicity.

The severity of pathologic lesions of T. gallinae in the upper digestive tract varies from a mild inflammation of the mucosa to caseous areas that block the esophageal lumen (Stabler 1954 ). Some virulent strains are able to create diphtheritic membranes-associated with fibrinous lesions in internal organs such as the liver, lungs, and peritoneum-resulting in high mortality (Narcisi et al. 1991) . Strains of moderate virulence are often associated with caseous abscesses in the upper digestive tract and oropharyngeal region, whereas no appreciable lesions are produced by avirulent strains (Cole and Friend 1999) . In vitro, T. gallinae proliferation has been associated with a disintegration of the cell monolayer, and genetically different T. gallinae isolates caused diverse magnitudes of cytopathic effects on different cell lines (Amin et al. 2012a ). However, little is known concerning the mechanism by which T. gallinae causes pathological changes in its hosts. Proteolytic proteins secreted by the parasite have been identified as contributing to the detachment of a cell monolayer (Amin et al. 2012b) .",

Consequently, signs of mild vaginitis, cervicitis, or endometritis, such as mucopurulent vaginal discharge, may be observed, although generally there are no overt signs. Conception apparently proceeds normally, but almost all conceptuses are lost at some time early in gestation with early fetal death and resorption but also abortion-with a peak loss at 70-90 days (Parsonson et al. 1976; Bielanski et al. 2004) . Infection can result in fetal maceration and pyometra. The consequence is infertility (Parsonson et al. 1976; BonDurant 1985; Ball et al. 1987; Anderson et al. 1996) . Abortions of fetuses typically occur around 2 months of gestational age. Abortions of fetuses older than 4 months of gestational age due to trichomonosis have been occasionally reported. If the affected cow undergoes early fetal loss, it may cycle regularly without showing any signs but a prolonged interestrous interval (BonDurant 1985) . Pyometra occurs in less than 5% of infected cows and is followed-as the corpus luteum of pregnancy is maintained-by a large purulent response (Rhyan et al. 1988) ; pyometra is probably a result of bacterial contamination that occurs at the time of fetal loss, when the cervix is likely to relax sufficiently to admit contamination from outside the environment (Rhyan et al. 1995a) . Cows that are infected with T. foetus typically clear the infection within a few months, i.e., after three cycles (Parsonson et al. 1976 ). Immunity, however, is not permanent, and the cow will be subject to reinfection and embryonic death in subsequent breeding periods, and, as mentioned earlier, some infected cows may carry infections into the next breeding season (Skirrow 1987; Mancebo et al. 1995) .",

Typical clinical signs in natural infections are chronic or intermittent large bowel diarrhea, which can vary from subclinical to intractable (reviewed by Gookin et al. (1999) , Gookin et al. (2001 ), Foster et al. (2004 , Manning (2010) , Yao and K\u00f6ster (2015) ). The feces are described as yellow-green in color, gassy, and malodorous with typical signs of colitis including fresh blood, mucus, fecal incontinence, tenesmus, and flatulence. The consistency of the feces can vary from liquid to semi-formed or cow pat (Stockdale et al. 2009 ). Severe cases may be accompanied by marked inflammation of the anal region, fecal incontinence, and rectal prolapse (Gookin et al. 1999; Foster et al. 2004; Tolbert and Gookin 2009; Bell et al. 2010 ). In addition, some infected cats have been reported showing systemic signs including anorexia, depression, vomiting, and weight loss (Stockdale et al. 2009 ). Mortality is extremely rare and only reported in kittens and is presumably caused by endotoxic shock because of deep lesions in the colonic mucosa (Holliday et al. 2009 ). The majority of infected cats maintain good body condition and appetite without signs of systemic illness (Gookin et al. 1999 (Gookin et al. , 2001 Tolbert and Gookin 2009 ). The long-term prognosis for T. foetus-infected cats is usually good and most will eventually overcome the infection. Remission could take between 4 months and 3 years, with irregular episodes of diarrhea of variable length (Gookin et al. 1999 . No abnormalities are routinely noted on hematology and serum biochemistry profile of some cats, though they remain infected and continue shedding the organism despite clinical improvement, i.e. these cats represent asymptomatic carriers. (Manning 2010) . Some positive cats were also infected with other pathogens, like Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., coccidian, or feline immunodeficiency virus (Gookin et al. 1999; Stockdale et al. 2009 ); concurrent infections may contribute and increase susceptibility and vulnerability to intestinal disease in infected cats.",

T. gallinarum parasitizes the large intestine of gallinaceous and anseriform birds. T. gallinarum induces usually a latent infection in the absence of clinical signs and lesions, and it is not clear whether T. gallinarum should be regarded a primary pathogen (Amin et al. 2011; Friedhoff et al. 1991) . However, the presence of T. gallinarum may aggravate primary diseasese.g., caused by Histomonas meleagridis-and coinfections have been observed (Grabensteiner and Hess 2006) . T. gallinae is of veterinary and economic importance, as it causes avian trichomonosis, a disease with important medical and commercial implications, which is known as pigeon canker, canker, roup, or Gelber Knopf (Amin et al. 2014) . T. gallinae is located in the upper digestive tract of pigeons, causing lesions (BonDurant and Honigberg 1994). The disease is characterized by greenish fluid and caseous lesions-whitish-yellowish fibrinous material-on the oropharyngeal membranes that can block the lumen of the esophagus impairing drinking and feeding. Clinical signs associated with avian trichomonosis are loss of appetite, vomiting, ruffled feathers, diarrhea, dysphagia, dyspnea, weight loss, increased thirst, inability to stand or to maintain balance, and a pendulous crop (Narcisi et al. 1991) . Death may occur within 3 weeks of infection. Infected birds can also remain asymptomatic due to the infection with avirulent strains of trichomonads or a lower susceptibility as seen in older birds. Avian trichomonosis may also affect domestic fowl; in earlier studies severe outbreaks have been recorded in chickens and turkeys, but we are not aware on recent cases (Hawn 1937 ",

The OIE Terrestrial Manual provides protocols for sampling, sample transportation, transport medium, culture media, culture conditions, and how to read out the culture test. In addition, the OIE Terrestrial Manual also provides recommendations for PCR analyses, which can be applied in combination either with or after culture as an ancillary test or-more often-direct as the primary test to examine bovine samples-i.e., preputial material, uterine or vaginal secretions, or abomasal content of aborted fetuses. Protocols to diagnose bovine tritrichomonosis have been described in detail previously (Sager et al. 2007 ). To diagnose T. foetus infection in cattle, PCR tests may have a higher or at least the same sensitivity as culture tests but have several advantages, because parasites in the sample do not need to be viable and PCR results are rapidly available in contrast to results of culture tests. On the other hand, culture tests are superior to PCR because of their relative easiness (Yao 2013) .",

In a large field study, including 2832 mature bulls from 124 beef herds in Argentina, Bayesian estimation revealed a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 72.0% (59-87%) and 95.4% (94-96%), respectively (Perez et al. 2006) . A repeated testing of bulls-e.g., three times with intervals of several days-has been shown to increase the diagnostic sensitivity of the cell culture test close to 100%. Of 29 samples collected from 5 experimentally infected bulls with resting periods of 2-4 days between samplings, 24 (83%) were determined as positive (Mukhufhi et al. 2003) . In another study, consecutive testing over a period of more than 7 months resulted in the determination of an infection rate of 100% in 15 bulls (Clark et al. 1971) . For bulls from herds in which T. foetus is endemic, two to four tests per bull may be required to ensure that the bull is not infected (Parker et al. 1999) . A sexual rest of bulls for a minimum of about 1-2 weeks prior to sampling increases sensitivity (Yule et al. 1989a) .",

Immediate cultivation is ideal but rarely possible. A 1-day delay is estimated to cause a loss of diagnostic sensitivity of 10% (Sager et al. 2007 ). Sampling the parasite into transportation media providing nutrients has been shown to be essential for the survival of trichomonads, especially if time between sampling and starting cultivation is exceeding 2 days (Kimsey et al. 1980; Hale et al. 2009 ). An earlier study showed that physiological saline with 5% fetal serum or lactate Ringer's solution was effective (Kimsey et al. 1980) . A thyoglycolate transport medium was also shown to be suitable; however, sensitivity of the subsequent cell culture test was slightly lower than after transport using InPouch TF medium (BioMed Diagnostics, White City, OR, USA). Today the medium used for later cultivation is often also used as transportation medium-i.e., InPouch TF or Diamond's medium (Bryan et al. 1999 ).",

The medium of InPouch TF-Feline is thought to be highly specific to T. foetus, and the morphologically similar flagellates P. hominis and Giardia spp. should not survive longer in this medium than 24 h . However, the InPouch TF-Feline medium seems to be not entirely selective as P. hominis could be successfully cultivated and identified after 3 days following inoculation of InPouch TF-Feline medium using cat feces (Ceplecha et al. 2013 ).",

The major advantage of DNA detection by PCR is that it is independent of parasite viability and contaminating microbes that may inhibit trichomonad cultivation. Correspondingly, sensitivity of PCR is often reported to be higher than cultivation and direct microscopical examination (recently reviewed by Yao (2013)). However, PCR analysis has also a number of disadvantages since due to its sensitivity it is prone to carry-over and crosscontamination. In addition, samples may contain inhibitory components that may reduce the sensitivity of PCR or even disable amplification. Each lab should validate the entire diagnostic process-including DNA extraction and PCR amplification-prior to carry out PCR detection as laboratory-specific conditions, equipment, or consumables may have an impact on the outcome of the diagnostic process (Hoorfar et al. 2004; Conraths and Schares 2006) .",

Material obtained by scraping may contain blood or fecal contaminations from outside the preputium, and material collected by preputial washing may contain urine. Blood, fecal components, and urine may act as PCR inhibitors, and, therefore, it is necessary to minimize or avoid such contaminations. Analytical sensitivities of PCR protocols are high and usually sufficient to detect the DNA of a single parasite (Table 14 .1). In field samples, however, analytical sensitivity might be much lower and has been reported to be around 100 organisms per sample (Mukhufhi et al. 2003) . In an assessment of diagnostic sensitivity carried out with spiked cat feces, ten organisms per 200 mg of feces were Ho et al. (1994) detected in 90% of nested PCR tests, and 100 organisms per 200 mg of feces were detected in 100% of nested PCR tests (Gookin et al. 2002) . It has been shown that also in PCR diagnosis the likelihood to detect T. foetus decreases with time between sampling and analysis. In one study it was reported that diagnostic sensitivity in PCR detection declined from 90% when samples were stored for 6 h to 31% when they were stored for 5 days (Mukhufhi et al. 2003) . It has been hypothesized that hydrolases secreted by trichomonads are responsible for this effect (Thomford et al. 1996; Sager et al. 2007 ). Adding the DNA-stabilizing agent guanidinium thiocyanate-GuSCN in a final concentration of 200 mmol/Lor a commercial lysis buffer for sample collection known to preserve DNA for several months at room temperature to the transport medium did not improve results (Mukhufhi et al. 2003; Mendoza-Ibarra et al. 2012) . Fecal samples from cats should be submitted within 24 h after sampling at room temperature or 4 \u00b0C.",

Internal controls of unrelated DNAs have been integrated into a 5\u2032 nuclease assay-real-time PCR assays with TaqMan probes. In this type of assay it is possible to incorporate an unrelated DNA into the sample prior to DNA purification, which is later amplified in a multiplex assay along with the parasite DNA but detected by a probe carrying a fluorophore different than that of the parasite-specific probe. One commercially available T. foetus real-time PCR includes such a control system (VetMAX\u2122-Gold Trich Detection Kit, Life Technologies).

In T. foetus-infected cows, antibodies appear in the cervicovaginal mucus about 6 weeks after infection and persist for several months (Pierce 1947) . A mucus agglutination test detected 32% (57 of 178) of cows in naturally infected herds, and no cows from clean herds tested positive (Pierce 1949) . The mucus agglutination test was shown to be specific as no cross-reactions with Campylobacter fetus or Brucella abortus has been observed. However, the reliability of the test was strongly influenced by the type of mucus. The mucus agglutination test was regarded as herd test (Pierce 1949 ). \u2022 A serum agglutination tests, similar to the mucus agglutination test, did not show results that correlated well with the T. foetus infection status of cows (Kerr 1944 ). \u2022 A hemolytic assay has been established which showed in female cattle a diagnostic specificity of 96% and a diagnostic sensitivity of 94% . However, only 43% of chronically infected bulls tested positive when this test was applied . \u2022 Indirect ELISAs to detect parasite-specific antibodies. An indirect ELISA (iELISA) based on the TF1.17 surface antigen of T. foetus showed promising results when tested with cervico-vaginal mucus of heifers (Ikeda et al. 1995) . TF1.17 surface antigen-specific IgG1, IgA, and IgM antibodies in the smegma of bulls naturally infected with T. foetus-as determined and measured by ELISAwere observed concurrently with T. foetus-positive smegma cultures (Rhyan et al. 1999) ; to the best of our knowledge, this approach was not further elaborated. In vaccination studies, IgG1, IgG2, IgA, and IgE responses were monitored in the preputial secretions or in sera of bulls by using a whole T. foetus cell antigen preparation for ELISA (Cobo et al. 2009 ). \u2022 An iELISA coated with whole T. foetus parasites and fixed with ethanol was used to determine an isotype-specific antibody response in the reproductive tract secretions and sera of T. foetus-infected heifers (Skirrow and BonDurant 1990a) . In cervical and vaginal secretions, parasite-specific IgA and IgG1 antibodies predominated 7-12 weeks after infection, while in serum, parasite-specific IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies were detected. Interestingly, elevated antibody levels were observed after reinfection using this iELISA (Skirrow and BonDurant 1990a) . A similar iELISA with immobilized whole T. foetus parasites was used to monitor the T. foetus-antibody response in immunized heifers naturally challenged by being bred with a naturally infected bull (Cobo et al. 2002) . The presented serological tests have not been used or validated for routine diagnostic purposes.",

The most efficient method of sampling vaginal and preputial secretions is insertion of an insemination/infusion pipette inside the vaginal fornix or preputial cavity and performing short strokes while concurrently aspirating secretions (Cobo et al. 2007 ). Vagina or preputial cavity can be washed with PBS to recover more organisms, although this usually dilutes the sample. Alternatively, preputial secretions can be collected by scraping with a plastic or metal brush, with no significant differences in culture sensitivity compared to using a pipette (Tedesco et al. 1979; Parker et al. 1999) .",

In addition, sampling of bulls reduces costs as preputial samples have to be taken only from a smaller number of bulls. Diagnosis in the bull involves collecting, transporting, and culturing the sample in special growth media and tentatively identifying the organism by microscopic examination. Finally a confirmation of detection using PCR has to be carried out to confirm a T. foetus infection (Fig. 14.4) . If samples are processed by PCR, the use of pooled direct preputial samples is possible. However, this strategy required repeated sampling to optimize sensitivity (Garcia Guerra et al. 2013) . Optimally, all bulls belonging to the same herd should be sampled. In those herds in which periodic sanitary control is carried out without previous history of venereal diseases and with good pregnancy rates, at least two consecutive samplings of all bulls should be performed, with a minimum of 1 or 2 weeks time between them (Skirrow et al. 1985; Kimsey et al. 1980) . Consecutive testing is necessary due to the low diagnostic sensitivity of an individual test. If both samplings revealed negative results, the herd can be considered tritrichomonosis free.",

Samples can be collected from bulls by scraping the preputial and penile mucosa with an artificial insemination pipette or scraper, by preputial lavage, or by washing the artificial vagina after semen collection (Cobo et al. 2007; Tedesco et al. 1979; Parker et al. 1999) .

Inside the preputial cavity, the pipette is pulled forward through the plastic sheath to expose the tip and moved back and forward in short strokes adjacent to the glans penis, especially near the fornix, while aspirating and massaging the glands penis to release greater amounts of smegma into the pipette. A new plastic sheath is used for each bull (Cobo et al. 2007 ). \u2022 A sterile, dry, plastic insemination/infusion pipette of 43 cm length with a 10-15 mL syringe attached to one end is placed into the preputial fornix. The pipette is scraped vigorously across the preputial epithelium without aspiration, and then negative pressure is applied with the syringe to collect preputial smegma. The negative pressure is released before removing the pipette from the sheath, to avoid aspiration of urine or other contaminants. After removing the pipette from the sheath, the sample is placed immediately into a transport or culture medium. A new syringe and pipette are used for each bull (Rodning et al. 2008 ). \u2022 A plastic or metal scraping instrument of approximately 70 cm in length, having at the anterior end a grooved surface of approximately 10 cm in length by 0.8 cm in diameter, which is used to perform scraping of the preputial mucosa.

It is then carefully withdrawn from the preputial cavity, avoiding contamination with the external part of the foreskin (Terzolo et al. 1992) .

In this procedure, the penis is extended by electrostimulation with a rectal probe. Once extended, a 16-ply gauze sponge is used to wipe around the glans and down the penile shaft and exposed preputial mucosa two to three times. Recently, it has been demonstrated that sponge sampling of T. foetus from bulls is a valid method (Dewell et al. 2016 ). The method facilitates easier collection once the penis is extended and is potentially safer for the veterinarian and the bull. Additionally, the gauze sponge method might be slightly more sensitive than the pipette method (Dewell et al. 2016 ).",

Samples are suspended in saline and examined immediately under a cover slip at 200 to 400-fold magnification using a light or, preferably, a phase-contrast microscope (Fig. 14.5 ). Although direct smears represent a cheap, quick, and readily available technique, the sensitivity of microscopic examination of a direct fecal smear is low. The diagnostic sensitivity of a direct smear using samples from naturally infected cats has been shown to be only 14% in one study, but sensitivity can be increased by analyzing multiple fecal smears . Other challenge associated with this diagnostic procedure is the skill of the practitioner in identifying motile trichomonads. T. foetus cannot precisely be distinguished by microscopical examination from P. hominis and is often misdiagnosed as Giardia spp. (Tolbert and Gookin 2009; Manning 2010; Yao and K\u00f6ster 2015) . A video clip demonstrating the classic jerky motility has been provided by the North Carolina State University, College of Veterinary Medicine website (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF06jlbcF8E; accessed 22.

Sample submission requirement for in vitro culture diagnostic includes the collection of fresh feces-roughly the size of a lima bean-and the use of transportgrowth media, InPouch TF or modified Diamond's media. It is recommended to dilute the fecal samples in PBS or physiological saline-to about 1 to 20 v/v-to create a homogenous mixture with a semiliquid consistency to be used as the inoculum for the culture medium, reducing the bacteria burden in the sample (Arranz-Solis et al. 2016). Furthermore, it is crucial for a reliable diagnosis of feline trichomonosis to keep the time delay from sample collection to processing as short as possible, given the environmental fragility of T. foetus trophozoites . In order to maximize the diagnostic sensitivity, cat feces should be inoculated into the culture within a 6-h period after voiding and to be submitted at room temperature-23 to 25 \u00b0C-to a specialized diagnostic laboratory within 24 h (Hale et al. 2009 ).

Cultures are examined microscopically periodically up to 7 days-normally every 24-48 h-on a wet mount slide prepared directly from the culture or through the plastic wall of the InPouch TF kit. Most of the microscopically positive culture samples are detected 72 h post-incubation. It has to be mentioned that the diagnosis by culture is more difficult for cats than for bovines due to the nature of the feces sample. As feces are directly cultured in enriched media, bacterial and/or fungal contamination is more likely to arise. Bacterial contamination severely impairs the culture of T. foetus and is able to reduce the sensitivity of the culture method. Incubation at 37 \u00b0C shows a quicker positive result but also more bacterial overgrowth potentially inhibiting the growth of T. foetus. If the commercial InPouch TF-Feline test kit is used, an accumulation of gas within the pouches due to an overgrowth of fecal flora is a commonly observed problem. Moreover, T. foetus and related parasites are hard to distinguish with light microscopy because of the similar morphology. Culture-positive samples require confirmation by PCR because also other trichomonads like P. hominis are able to grow (Ceplecha et al. 2013) .",

Under optimized conditions, a direct diagnosis by PCR-i.e., without a prior cell culture test-offers a highly specific and a sensitive diagnostic alternative also able to detect nonviable parasites. Moreover, PCR is the method of choice to confirm positive results by culture. It is important to monitor a potential PCR inhibition in each individual sample. The choice of an appropriate DNA extraction technique greatly influences the reliability and sensitivity of PCR (Stauffer et al. 2008; Hale et al. 2009 ). Several methods have been successful employed for feline trichomonosis diagnosis, such as a modified procedure using the commercial QIAamp DNA stool minikit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), Boom's method, or ZR Fecal DNA kit ZR (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA), which was able to detect 10 T. foetus organisms per 100 mg feces in 100% of PCR reactions (Stauffer et al. 2008 ). Diagnostic T. foetus PCR using primers TFR3/TFR4 and a single-tube nested PCR using primers TFITS-F/TFITS-R in combination with primers TFR3/TFR4 are widely used for feline trichomonosis diagnosis (Table 14 .1) ). PCR amplification of DNA extracted from feces samples appears to be more sensitive than the InPouch TF culture, and a high level of agreement has been described between the culture and PCR detection (Gookin et al. 2002; Hosein et al. 2013; Arranz-Solis et al. 2016) .",

Bovine tritrichomonosis is considered endemic in herds managed under extensive conditions and using natural service for breeding (Bondurant 2005) . The economic impact of tritrichomonosis infection has to be regarded severe in particular regions of the world. The calf crop in affected beef and dairy herds can be reduced up to 50% in beef operations (Rae 1989) . Economic losses are variable and depend on the percentage of bulls infected and the susceptibility of the cows in the herd. Further losses, in addition to calf crop losses, include an extended breeding season due to an increased number of repeat breeders. Due to later calving, the growing periods for calves might be shortened, and there are batches of calves of different ages with a wide variation in weaning weights. Summarizing these losses, it was estimated that tritrichomonosis in a herd caused a 35% decrease in economic return per cow in an infected herd (Rae 1989) . Economic losses in a case of bovine tritrichomonosis in a large Californian dairy herd were calculated at 665 US$ per infected cow (Goodger and Skirrow 1986) .",

A recent survey conducted in Switzerland involving 1362 preputial samples from bulls and 60 abomasal fluid samples of aborted fetuses from beef and dairy herds revealed no T. foetus-positive finding (Bernasconi et al. 2014 ). However, also in areas assumed to be largely free of bovine tritrichomonosis, a reestablishment of the infection in herds, especially in beef herds farmed under extensive, pastoral systems, is possible as shown by findings from Spain (Mendoza-Ibarra et al. 2012; Mendoza-Ibarra et al. 2013) . Knowledge on risk factors is important for the implementation of effective measures to control tritrichomonosis. Results from risk factor studies were used to model effects of vaccination against tritrichomonosis in beef herds. A number of potential herdlevel risk factors were assessed, including \"no. of cows,\" \"no. of young bulls,\" \"trichomonad testing yes/no,\" \"no. of trichomonad tests,\" \"shared grazing,\" \"previous diagnosis of trichomonosis,\" or \"duration of breeding season\" (Villarroel et al. 2004) .",

Several studies established that the likelihood of bulls being infected seems to increase with age (Skirrow et al. 1985; McCool et al. 1988; BonDurant et al. 1990; Rae et al. 1999 Rae et al. , 2004 Mendoza-Ibarra et al. 2012) (Table 14 .1). In one experiment using bulls-3 to 6 years of age-all bulls more than 4 years old became infected after three to six services while only one of two young bulls, 2-3 years of age, became infected after nine services . Bulls less than 4 years of age are rarely carriers of T. foetus (BonDurant 1985; Perez et al. 1992; Ondrak 2016; Kimsey et al. 1980; Skirrow et al. 1985; BonDurant et al. 1990 ). The reason for this finding is not completely understood. Old bulls may have had a higher number of sexual contacts than young bulls. An often mentioned other possible reason is the more pronounced invaginations in the penile and preputial epithelium of older bulls-i.e., the crypts of these epithelia are becoming deeper and increase in number with the age of the bull (BonDurant 1985; Skirrow et al. 1985; McCool et al. 1988; Perez et al. 1992; Ondrak 2016) . However, the hypothesis that anatomical changes are the cause for older bulls found to be infected more often was recently questioned because no age-related statistically significant differences were observed in the surface architecture of the penile and preputial epithelium of bulls (Ondrak 2016; Strickland et al. 2014 ).",

Several studies of infected cows indicate that the os cervix is the preferred site of multiplication and persistence (Skirrow and BonDurant 1990b) . Initial multiplication of T. foetus after infection seems to be followed by a decline of parasite numbers until next estrus . The numbers of parasites present in the cervicovaginal mucus seem to fluctuate during the estrus cycle, and the largest numbers are seen a few days before estrus . In two infected heifers that have been followed over time after experimental infection, T. foetus was not always observed in vaginal mucus by microscopic examinations or culture isolation suggesting fluctuations in vaginal parasite concentration; however, only in one heifer, there was a coincidence between the detection of T. foetus and the time of estrus (Simmons and Laws 1957) . Not all cows are able to clear infection. Carrier dams have been reported-e.g., two chronically infected dams were observed in one Australian study 16 and 22 months after initial infection (Alexander 1953) . In a Californian dairy herd, infected cows were found positive 9 weeks after pregnancy or 63 days after parturition (Skirrow 1987; Goodger and Skirrow 1986) . In a more recent study from Argentina, several heifers remained infected up to 300 days after breeding which underlines the importance of these carrier state heifers for persistence of infection in affected herds (Mancebo et al. 1995) .",

The higher number of bulls and lower bull-to-cow ratios are typical management practices in large herds to increase conception rates (Rae et al. 2004) . It was hypothesized that by these practices the number of potential sexual contacts per bull and the probability for an individual bull to become positive are increased (Rae et al. 2004 ). \u2022 Breed disposition: The possibility of a breed predisposition was discussed based on study results suggesting a higher prevalence of infection in particular breeds (BonDurant et al. 1990; Perez et al. 1992; Rae et al. 1999 Rae et al. , 2004 Skirrow et al. 1985; Abbitt and Meyerholz 1979) . A number of epidemiological studies addressed this question ( et al. 1990 ). Another study in Costa Rica also found a strong association between the risk of positive findings and the Bos taurus taurus breed-as compared to Bos taurus indicus pure or hybrid breeds (Perez et al. 1992) ; an additional study also showed an increased risk in Angus, Charolais, Hereford, or Simmental breeds relative to B. taurus indicus (Rae et al. 2004 ) (Table 14. 2). However, findings suggesting breed disposition should be interpreted with care; studies might have been biased by uneven study designs or by not paying enough attention to the differences in the way herds of particular breeds were operated (Ondrak 2016) . It was hypothesized that prevalence differences could be due to the increased number of matings accomplished by B. taurus taurus bulls as compared to B. taurus indicus bulls in the same period of time, thus increasing the risk of exposure to infection (Perez et al. 1992) . However, there are also some studies that did not observe differences in prevalence of infection between B. taurus taurus and B. taurus indicus (Dennett et al. 1974 ). Nevertheless, a breed disposition and genetically based predisposition should not be completely ruled out. Further studies are needed to elucidate the reason why some of the infected dams are becoming carrier of T. foetus-being still infected after pregnancy-while others immediately eliminate infection during the first 2 to 3 months after loss of the conceptus (Alexander 1953; Goodger and Skirrow 1986; Skirrow 1987; Mancebo et al. 1995) . It is possible that like in other diseases there are genetic determinants influencing a predisposition to acquire infection and to develop immunity against the pathogen.",

These findings confirm previous observations in beef herds from Idaho, which identified \"commingling on BLM-Bureau of Lands Management-allotment; FS, US Forest Service, allotment; or on any public land allotment\" as an important predictor of positive herds (Gay et al. 1996) . Also in Argentina \"shared livestock with others\" was identified as a significant risk factor for herds testing positive, that is, having positive bulls (Mardones et al. 2008) . In summary, these findings suggest that any type of mingling herds and also fence-line contact with other herds represent important risk factors and should be avoided by farmers (Jin et al. 2014 ). \u2022 Transmission within herds: Other predictors characterized the likelihood of transmission within a herd. Obviously, herd size plays a role. A study on beef herds in Idaho, USA, identified \"total cattle grazed on FS-US Forest Serviceallotment more than 844\" as a risk factor, and a study from Florida, USA, observed that herds with more than or equal to 500 cows had a higher risk of being positive (Gay et al. 1996; Rae et al. 2004) . The latter study also identified particular herd management practices increasing the individual risk of bulls to test positive; therefore, most likely, herd size is a confounder explained by man-agement practices in large herds in favor for T. foetus transmission, like \"no. of bulls used per unit larger than or equal to 10\" or \"bull-to-cow ratio per unit smaller than 1 to 25\" as discussed earlier (Rae et al. 2004 ). The management practice \"rotation of bulls within a herd\" has been identified in an Argentinian study to most likely favor to perpetuate transmission of infection within a herd (Mardones et al. 2008) . The same may apply to an observation that among \"rearing beef herds\"-i.e., herds that rear cattle until the weight of 150-250 kg-the prevalence of positive herds was higher as compared to \"full-cycle herds,\" herds with breeding, rearing, and fattening. This observation was explained by hypothesizing a higher proportion of reproductively active animals resulting in an increased spreading of disease in \"rearing beef herds\" compared to \"full-cycle herds\" (Mardones et al. 2008) . The risk factors related to a potential perpetuation/acceleration of transmission inside herds cannot be easily used to give recommendations with respect to better management practices, because these risk factors are either unspecific or difficult to change.",

However, the formation of pseudocysts, which may support survival in the environment, has been reported for T. foetus (Pereira-Neves and Benchimol 2009 ). In addition, it has been shown that feline T. foetus is able to survive outside of its host for at least 30 min on dry cat food and 180 min in drinking water or urine (Rosypal et al. 2012) . Other studies showed that T. foetus can survive in cat feces for several hours or even days or up to at least 5 days in wet cat food (Hale et al. 2009; Van der Saag et al. 2011) . Even the survival of a passage through the alimentary tract of slugs (Limax maximus, Limacus flavus) was demonstrated, suggesting that slugs could transmit T. foetus over short distance (Van der Saag et al. 2011) . The predominant mode of infection is the fecal-oral route, and most likely a close contact of cats favors the spread of transmission.",

            "text": "\u2022 Age. With a few exceptions, it is now accepted that T. foetus associated with large bowel diarrhea is mainly a disease of young cats. Several studies revealed that cats about 1 year old or younger are more often T. foetus positive than elder cats (Table 14. 3). These observations were made in studies including only healthy or healthy and diseased cats as well as in studies including almost only diseased cats (Profizi et al. 2013; Kuehner et al. 2011; Queen et al. 2012 ; Gali\u00e1n Paris et al. 2014 ). These epidemiological findings confirm the results of follow-up studies of cats with T. foetus infections, which clearly showed that clinical signs spontaneously resolve within 2 years of onset and that it is difficult to detect T. foetus in cats after several weeks of infection (Gookin et al. 2001; Foster et al. 2004 ). Meta-analysis on available data confirmed this view (Yao and K\u00f6ster 2015) . The reasons why especially young cats are affected by T. foetus diarrhea are not sufficiently understood. Possible explanations are a more intense contact of kittens to their mothers or to larger numbers of other cats in breeding centers, private households, or cat shelters, which may favor transmission of T. foetus and may also influence the dose by which kittens become infected. Immunity against feline T. foetus is poorly understood; recently the possibility that parasite-specific secretory IgA mediates immunity has been discussed (Yao and K\u00f6ster 2015) . Histological examinations in infected cats revealed influx of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils into the subepithelial lamina propria (Yaeger and Gookin 2005) . The inflammatory response might not only be involved in pathogenesis but may also be involved in the control of infection (Tolbert and Gookin 2016 ). \u2022 Breed. A number of studies identified an increased risk of infection in purebred, or pedigree cats, or particular breeds (Hosein et al. 2013; Stockdale et al. 2009; Steiner et al. 2007; Gunn-Moore et al. 2007; Paris et al. 2014 ). These observations remain largely unexplained. Most likely the conditions under which purebred or pedigree cats are reared are responsible for the increased risk. Purebred cats from breeding centers represent densely housed populations, and due to the frequent, close, and direct contact, the risk of infection might be higher than in mixed breed cats reared in less dense populations (Yao and K\u00f6ster 2015; Arranz-Solis et al. 2016 ). \u2022 Other risk factors. One other risk factor identified was \"attendance to cat shows,\" which might be a confounding predictor; the predictor could be related to the increased risk of purebred or pedigree cats (Hosein et al. 2013) . There is only a single study report on food-related predictors. In a Canadian study, \"fed a raw food diet\" has been identified as a risk factor (Hosein et al. 2013 ). \u2022 Other concurrent infections and impaired immune system. In experimental T.",

            "text": "T. gallinae infection seems not to be host species-specific. However, studies on parasite diversity suggest that there are subtypes more commonly found in certain bird species (Gerhold et al. 2008; Grabensteiner et al. 2010; Sansano-Maestre et al. 2009 ). T. gallinae is most common among domestic pigeons and wild doves, and these species may represent a reservoir also for other bird species. Accordingly, rock pigeons-Columba liva-were regarded as source for the worldwide distribution of T. gallinae (Stabler 1954; Harmon et al. 1987) . Most pigeons harbor this protozoan but rarely show clinical disease (Stabler 1954) . Hawks, falcons, and owls may become infected, most likely via predation of other infected birds (Rogers et al. 2016) . In recent years, severe outbreaks of avian trichomonosis caused by T. gallinae have been recorded initially in wild finches, later in Passeriformes, canaries, and psittacines in Europe and North America since 2005 (reviewed by Amin et al. (2010) ). Trichomonosis is also reported in several other bird species, including corvids in California, USA (Anderson et al. 2009 ). T. gallinae has a low tenacity in the environment and is regarded as unable to survive a gastric passage, and droppings of birds are regarded as free of T. gallinae (Stabler 1954) . T. gallinae has no cyst stage. However, as mentioned for T. foetus (Sect. 14.1.1), the formation of pseudocysts has been reported (Tasca and De Carli 2003) . The importance of pseudocysts in the transmission of T. gallinae-e.g., via contaminated drinking water-is not sufficiently understood. Survival times in tap water and in carcasses are regarded as limited; a survival time of 8-48 h in carcasses has been reported (Erwin et al. 2000) . The following important facts about transmission of T. gallinae need to be taken into account:",

Feeding on infectious crop milk is regarded as an important route of infection for nestlings (Stabler 1954) . In other bird species, feeding nestlings by regurgitation might also be an important route of transmission. Close contacte.g., during courtship-is also regarded as a way by which the infection is spread between adult birds (Stabler 1954) . In Southeastern USA, trichomonosis was diagnosed more often in the spring and summer months than in autumn and winter months, which might be related to the times of courtship and feeding nestlings (Gerhold et al. 2007 ). \u2022 Transmission by drinking water: It is believed that infection of turkeys and chickens is caused by T. gallinae-contaminated drinking water (Stabler 1954) . Drinking water is also a likely source of infection for other bird species. \u2022 Effect of weather events on outbreaks of avian trichomonosis: T. gallinaeassociated finch mortality usually peaked in summer and autumn, but a correlation with climatic events has not been observed (Neimanis et al. 2010; Robinson et al. 2010; Lawson et al. 2011) . A coincidence of the emergence of avian trichomonosis with high temperature and low rainfall has been reported (Simpson and Molenaar 2006; Bunbury et al. 2007 ). It has been hypothesized that as a consequence of the dry and hot weather, numbers and volumes of water sources decline, which may favor, due to higher densities of birds aggregating at limited water sources, the transmission of T. gallinae ). \u2022 Transmission by predation: Pigeons and doves may also serve as a source of infection for raptors (Boal et al. 1998; Krone et al. 2005) . Although T. gallinae is a labile protozoan which does not remain viable for a prolonged period and is rapidly killed by desiccation, survival time seems to be long enough to be transmitted also to the nestlings of raptors (Krone et al. 2005 ).",

However, the disease is still present in many areas of the world were cattle are raised on pastures and natural mating is used. Prevention and control measures are based on the distinctive epidemiologic features of bovine tritrichomonosis, a sexually transmitted disease where infected bulls are asymptomatic carriers and represent a permanent source of infection while in heifers and cows infection is typically transient (Clark et al. 1971 Parsonson et al. 1974; Skirrow and BonDurant 1990b) .

T. foetus as a causative agent of this venereal transmitted disease may be present in semen if the semen has been contaminated with preputial fluid during manual collection (Bondurant 2005) . Recommendations for the importation of cattle and bulls for breeding can be found in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. In particular, emphasis has been placed in the measures applied to bull semen donor health status in order to avoid dissemination and transmission of the disease (http://www.oie.int/ index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_trichomonosis.htm; accessed 22.

In the province of La Pampa, Argentina, with a bovine census close to four million heads, more than 80% of bulls are tested twice each year, and positive bulls were culled. By this measure, a significant decrease in the number of infected herds and animals has been achieved in this region in the last 10 years (Fort et al. 2016) .

Replacement should be done by virgin animals or bulls acquired only from disease-free herds with records of excellence in reproductive performance. All the bulls must be tested during quarantine before entrance in the herd. If the bull comes from a tritrichomonosis-free herd, the analysis of two samples of preputial smegma with 1-2 weeks of interval during the quarantine is recommended. Three or more samples must be analyzed if bulls are provided from an area where tritrichomonosis is known to be endemic (Campero and Gottstein 2007; Yao 2013; Ondrak 2016) . The measure includes the prohibition of the use of communal, shared, or rented bulls, unless their herd of origin and individual health status are known. \u2022 Avoid communal pastures and keep fences in good conditions. These measures will help to control some of the two most important risk factors influencing disease transmission (Gay et al. 1996; Mardones et al. 2008; Jin et al. 2014 ). \u2022 No introduction of cows or heifers of unknown health status during the breeding season. Similar to bulls, heifers and cows must be acquired only from disease-free herds with records of excellence in reproductive performance.

It is recommended to sample the animal twice or three times before the breeding season and every time new bulls are introduced into herds (Bondurant 2005; Campero and Gottstein 2007; Yao 2013) . Once new cases are not detected, annual testing is recommended to verify the non-infected status of the herd. However, testing and culling policies alone, although effective in improving reproductive efficiency, do not allow the elimination of the disease since other putative risk factors associated with the disease are usually present in the management of beef herds (Yao 2013; Collantes-Fernandez et al. 2014 ). \u2022 Average age reduction of bulls and replacement of all bulls after four breeding seasons. Replacement with negative-tested young bulls reduces the prevalence since 3-year-old bulls seem not to be as susceptible as older bulls in natural service (Clark et al. 1971; Christensen et al. 1977) . A strong association of infection rate with age has been reported in several studies (Rae et al. 1999; Mendoza-Ibarra et al. 2012 ). \u2022 Pregnancy examination. It is mandatory to know the reproductive performance and the magnitude of the infertility problem in the herd. All open and aborted cows should be culled or segregated in high-risk sub-herds or groups (Campero and Gottstein 2007) . \u2022 Use of commercial vaccines. In the presence of a high prevalence of infection in an area, vaccination of all heifers and cows is a good measure to improve reproductive efficiency especially when risk factors associated with infection cannot be avoided-e.g., the use of communal pastures. Commercially available vaccines in the Americas offer an improvement in reproductive efficacy (Kvasnicka et al. 1989 (Kvasnicka et al. , 1992 . \u2022 Segregation of the herd in low-and high-risk sub-herds or groups. In the low-risk sub-herds, only dams that have recently calved are pregnant for more than 5 months, and virgin females must be included. These must be serviced preferably by virgin bulls or by bulls with two negative examinations and coming from negative herds. In order to follow the effect of the infection, the same group of females should be serviced with the same male until the disease is controlled (Campero and Gottstein 2007) . \u2022 Limiting of breeding season. The breeding season should be restricted to less than 4 months to reduce the duration of the possible transmission period as much as possible. In addition, with a shortened breeding season, it becomes easier to monitor reproductive performance.",

The vaccine used was able to generate a specific humoral immune response and shorten the period of infection in the vaccinated animals compared to the controls. A greater efficacy of a T. foetus membrane vaccine compared to a whole cell vaccine was observed; the animals had a shorter duration of infection, a higher pregnancy rate, and a lower rate of fetal mortality (Cobo et al. 2002) . Additional work has been done to identify T. foetus surface antigens such as TF1.17 and TF190 (Voyich et al. 2001) .

Since the viability of the parasite in the environment is limited, strict cleaning and disinfection measures are sensible measures to be implemented (Hale et al. 2009 ). Additionally, contamination of food and water by T. foetus is also possible; consequently, regular replacement of water and food and cleaning and disinfection of watering troughs and food bowls should be recommended. Due to the suggested role of some invertebrates to function as mechanical vectors, the avoidance of their presence in the litter box area and food and drinking areas may help to prevent infection transmission ( Van der Saag et al. 2011) . Finally, limiting contact between infected and non-infected cats will help to interrupt transmission of T. foetus in the population.",

One of the major aims would be to prevent attracting birds to feeding places. If feeding is necessary, such places should fulfill minimum requirements with regard to sanitary conditions, like regular changing of food and disinfection as suggested in a recent review (Amin et al. 2014 ). Since T. gallinae seems to require a wet environment to persist, drying of buildings and housing facilities following washing will support to control trichomonad infections. The prevention of the infection of prey birds, like pigeons nesting near urban areas, is necessary to prevent infection of predator birds. Due to the loss of habitat, predators have replaced their traditional prey mainly by urban pigeons (Boal et al. 1998; H\u00f6fle et al. 2000; Estes and Mannan 2003; Krone et al. 2005 ).",

However, subtherapeutic dosing and prophylactic use of these drugs against trichomonosis have resulted in emergence of resistant strains of T. gallinae (Franssen and Lumeij 1992; Munoz et al. 1998) . In wild birds, treatment is not a practical approach and generally not considered an option due to the way of application (Cole and Friend 1999) . These drugs can be only used in non-food-producing birds by veterinary prescription.",
