From here derived many of the advances of toxicology, the science of toxic substances (the word \"toxicology\" derives from the greek words \"toxon\" = arch and \"farmakon\" = poison; toxicon farmakon = poison for arch hunting): (b) from such practice derives the knowledge we have of stricnin, curare, ouabain, aconite, other plant/animal poisons primarily devised for hunting and fi ghting. (c) impingement of darts in decomposing cadavers or putrefaction soil (or manure >> tetanus) before throwing at enemies (New Guinea, tribal combats; Sciites 400 b.C.) (d) last but not least, the use of fear that humans have of beasts. Here comes the example of Hannibal (from Carthago), leading the ships of Prusia I, king of Bithynia (West Turkey) in a battle of year 184 b.C. against Eumene II (Attalides, Pergamon); he won that naval battle because he managed to throw canisters full of reptiles at the enemy ships, causing terror and uncoordinated reactions leading to his victory. He therefore used fear as a weapon: snakes were not even harmful (not poisonous), but big was the surprise and reactions were out of control! (e) In recent history, we can see that First World War (also named the war of Chemistry) contributed to the development and use of Nervine gases , chemical weapons banned everywhere but still existing in some countries. Second World War (also named the war of Physics) led to the development and use of the atomic bomb.",
