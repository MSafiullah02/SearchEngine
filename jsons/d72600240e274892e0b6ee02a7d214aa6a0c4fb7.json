Experimental stress induction has been shown to lead to changes in positive symptoms across psychosis continuum (Valmaggia et al., 2015; Veling et al., 2016) .

National government regulations involving social distancing lead to increasing feelings of loneliness which are associated with the onset and persistence of psychotic symptoms (Michalska da Rocha et al., 2018) . Strict regulations aiming to prevent further spread of the pandemic also cause significant burden, such as radical changes in daily routines, leading to feelings of insecurity, worries, anxiety or even hopelessness. On the other hand, a lot of positive protective factors such as solidarity and higher social cohesion have been taking place in the society. Despite the negative predictions from the media, the short-term and long-term impact of the current stressful situation on the subclinical psychotic experiences or mental health in general is yet to be confirmed empirically Our aim was to analyze changes in the positive psychotic experiences (PE) during the current pandemic in the non-clinical university student population. The secondary aim was to evaluate how PE are related to affective symptoms, perceived stress, and loneliness.",

Eighteen months later, during the first week of April 2020, an invitation for the follow-up survey was sent. The final sample consisted of 235 participants (77% of females, 36% response rate) with the mean age of M=23.77 and SD=4.03. PE were measured by the positive subscale of Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-42). Depression was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and anxiety with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7). These three measures were administered both at the baseline and the follow-up. At the follow-up, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) and Brief Loneliness Scale were added to the battery.",

            "text": "Repeated measures ANCOVA was used to calculate changes in PE. At follow-up, we statistically controlled for age and gender. The model without covariates lead to significant differences across waves, in that participants had lower frequency of PE at follow-up (F(1,234)=38.704, p<0.001, \u03b7 2 =0.142). The model with appropriate correction for demographic factors did not reveal statistical differences in the PE score across time (F(1,232)=1.010, p=0.316, \u03b7 2 =0.004). Numerically, participants at the follow-up scored slightly lower in PE. This finding can be explained by the regression to the mean or by fact that prevalence of PE is associated with lower age. PE at the follow-up were associated with depression (r s =0.323, p<0.001), anxiety (r s =0.269, p<0.001), perceived stress (r s =0.232, p<0.001), and loneliness (r s =0.285, p<0.001). When all measures were added simultaneously to the linear regression model, only depression explained PE above and beyond the effect of other predictors (\u03b2=0.259, p=0.011). Baseline PE were associated with PE (r s =0.703, p<0.001) (see Figure 1 .), depression (r s =0.255, p<0.001), anxiety (r s =0.209, p=0.001), perceived stress (r s =0.209, p=0.001), and loneliness (r s =0.212, p=0.001) at the follow-up. We found significant longitudinal relationships between PLE and negative affect, especially depression. Our results also provide evidence that loneliness and perceived stress were related to PLE both longitudinally and cross-sectionally. We believe that these results are important for health-related policies across universities. Given their age, students represent a population at higher risk of onset of mental disorders, especially psychotic disorders. National governments and universities should pay increased attention to the systematic protection and monitoring of the mental health and well-being of their students and provide an increased amount of psychosocial support to ameliorate the negative effect of risk factors for severe mental illnesses. This is especially important not only during current crisis. Our J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f results also revealed that PE in the university student population are relatively stable, even during this extremely stressful situation. Contrary to our expectation, the current situation was not associated with an increased level of PE in our sample. At the time of testing, we were at the beginning of world pandemic, therefore its impact on psychotic symptoms may be manifested after a longer period of time. Important protective factors such as increased contact with family members, social support, solidarity, and higher social cohesion in society, however, may also temporarily serve as a buffer against the current stressors. While longitudinal studies with longer follow-ups are necessary for understanding of the potentially complex effects of the current COVID-19-related crisis on mental health and well-being, its short-term impact on psychotic experiences did not appear to materialize in our sample. The extend of COVID-19 pandemic in country might also moderate extent of impact on psychotic experience.",
