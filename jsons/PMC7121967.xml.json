Using donors less than 21 years of age should be determined on an individual basis after a thorough psychological evaluation by a qualified mental health professional [8]. The use of donors over age 34 requires a discussion of the risk of aneuploidy and lower pregnancy rates associated with older women [10\u201312].

Legal issues include but are not limited to understanding rights to maintain and protect anonymity, discovering outcomes of donation, and whether or not future contact with any resulting children is desired [13]. For example, future anonymity could theoretically be reversed in court situations where the importance of the offspring knowing his/her genetic background is deemed to outweigh the donor\u2019s desire for privacy [13]. Arguments in favor of revealing the donor\u2019s identity stem from the fact that children born through donated oocytes were not a part of the original decision-making process. Though not yet regularly employed by centers nationally, informed consent should also contain information about the disposition of cryopreserved embryos resulting from oocyte donation, i.e., use for future pregnancies or donation for research [3, 13, 14]. However, these cryopreserved embryos cannot be reclaimed by donors in the future [13]. In summary, the potential donor should consider all legal matters both known and possible during the informed consent process (further discussed under Obligations and Rights).",

However, among the young healthy population of donors, this risk is very small [16].

Programs may wish to provide donors with adequate supplemental insurance coverage for medical complications arising from oocyte donation, and the terms of such coverage should be disclosed to the donor (further discussed in 10.1007/978-1-4471-2392-7_20).",

Some argue that outcomes should be disclosed because donors deserve to know whether their gametes resulted in a successful pregnancy. The knowledge of outcomes could be helpful in the event of planned or unplanned contact from the offspring, give donors the opportunity to tell their children about genetic half-siblings, and put psychological closure on their participation in oocyte donation [13].

Donors, who in the preceding 12 months, have had sex or close contact with any person having HIV infection including a positive or reactive test to HIV virus, hepatitis B infection, or clinically active (symptomatic) hepatitis C infection; have been incarcerated in a lockup, jail, or prison for more than 72 consecutive hours; had or have been treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia; or have undergone body piercing and/or tattooing procedures in which sterile procedures were not used or it is unclear whether sterile procedures were used, should also be excluded (Table 4.2) [8].\n",

            "text": "Serologic testing for hepatitis B infection utilizes EIA for the detection of antigens and antibodies, specifically the hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibodies (IgG and IgM) [8, 20]. These tests will reveal any infected donors and further distinguish between acute or chronic hepatitis. Though the majority of adults infected with the virus experience recovery, 1\u20135 % of immunocompetent adults are at risk for chronic hepatitis and thus cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [21]. Viral infection acquired during childhood or the perinatal period has a risk of persistent infection ranging from 20 to 90 % [21]. Women infected with hepatitis B infection should be excluded from egg donation and given appropriate recommendations for follow-up with a primary care physician or infectious disease specialist. Many donors may have received hepatitis B vaccination in childhood or adolescence. In these instances, past immunization may be confirmed by testing the serum for hepatitis B surface antibody [20].",

The second edition of this test, MMPI-2, has been shown to distinguish between those individuals who answer truthfully and those who try to underplay any psychopathologic behavior. Prior studies have found differences in MMPI-2 scores between donors who completed a donation cycle and those who were psychologically excluded, but were not able to reliably differentiate those accepted who would subsequently be noncompliant [46, 47]. ASRM guidelines do not currently require psychological testing with MMPI-2, but centers often use this evaluation in addition to their current psychological screening methods to assess potential oocyte donors.",

To combat such ferocious criticism, it is imperative that practitioners of egg donation pay careful attention to every aspect of donor recruitment and participation. Responsible practice fosters good outcomes and continued success. There will always be a great amount of pressure to either supply donors or accept donors that may be less than ideal (e.g., PCOS, hypothalamic amenorrhea), but doctors need and must be able to say no when faced with choices that pose undue risk to all participating.",

However, sperm and egg donation shares little in common with respect to time involvement and risk of participation, and therefore the need for more specific and detailed professional guidelines and safety measures was necessary to protect the women donating eggs, the women receiving them, and most importantly the child that results from their collaborative efforts. Dr. Thornton reviews the important basic requirements for establishing an egg donor program. Many of these professional activities are now being provided by \u201cagencies,\u201d which are typically not run by physicians, who then supply patients or programs with \u201cmatches.\u201d Regardless of whether an agency supplies the donor or a program chooses to screen potential donors themselves, the outlined steps provided in this chapter are crucial to follow in order to ensure safety and health. Ultimately, the responsibility falls to the doctors providing the hands-on care and in every case full knowledge of the donor\u2019s pedigree, health history, and reason for participating must be known.",

Today, we are working with the youngest women in the history of the technique, typically in their midtwenties, single, and without children. Injury to any one of them is catastrophic and ironically may in fact leave them infertile. We also can assume that some of these women will later experience infertility themselves and naturally will assume that their work as an egg donor contributed to their problem. Disclosure of all potential risks, including later regret, is difficult to do without frightening potential donors away. However, I believe it is better to inform each of them of the known complications and lose a few candidates rather than to perform a procedure that later leads to lifelong regret. It has always been my hope that every egg donor will look back on the experience with pride and satisfaction for having provided a truly unique gift of life.",
