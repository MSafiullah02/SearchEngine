The delivery of regional plastic surgery teaching programmes in the UK is variable ( We appointed a webinar co-ordination team in January 2020 to manage and develop the webinar series. We have found that the presence of a facilitator is essential to introduce the speaker, lead the Q&A session by eliciting questions and encouraging interaction, and ensure time-keeping.",

The Plastic Surgery Trainees Association (PLASTA) recognised the need for additional educational resources to supplement trainees' preparation for the FRCS(Plast) examination. To this end, we designed a national webinar series based on the current 2016 Plastic Surgery curriculum. Commencing in March 2019, we have hosted monthly webinars -web-based presentations or lectures delivered in real time via the internet (5)using the Zoom\u2122 platform . This allows for video and audio conferencing, screen-sharing, live text chat and submission of questions. Participants are invited by e-mail (mean open rate 65%) through the PLASTA mailing list which currently has 476 subscribers. Participant demographics are collected via an automated registration process, and they are sent a unique link to log into the webinar. The webinars are advertised on social media, on WhatsApp\u2122 via our network of regional representatives, and through the BAPRAS membership e-mail bulletin. Reminders are e-mailed to all registered attendees at one week, two days and one hour prior to the webinar. Each webinar is structured around a Consultant-led presentation lasting 45 minutes, with an FRCS(Plast) exam focus, followed by a facilitated question and answer session lasting 15 minutes. At the conclusion of each session, participants are 4 automatically redirected to a SurveyMonkey\u2122 feedback form. Speakers, whom are all Consultant Plastic Surgeons and experts in their webinar topic, are provided with a certificate and a summary of feedback for use in appraisals and revalidation. All webinars are recorded, edited, and uploaded onto the PLASTA website for members only to access on-demand following speaker review.",
