To date there are no universally recommended therapy for the disease. Many scientists are now making efforts to develop effective drugs against SARS. The combination therapy of corticosteroid with lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir can improve clinical response and reduce mortality rates apparently [2], [3]. Cinatl et al. [4] found that ribavirin, azauridine, pyrazofurin and glycyrrhizin are active against SARS-CoV. Barnard et al. [5] reported that calpain inhibitors and \u03b2-d-N4-hydroxycytidine exhibit inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV.",

A pharmacophore is the 3D arrangement of atoms or functional groups essential for the compound to bind to a specific receptor [6]. The power of a pharmacophore model is to discover new leads by using 3D database pharmacophore searching and guide chemists to synthesize new compounds [7]. Such a pharmacophore-based method has been successfully applied to many drug development programs [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. The main proteinase of SARS-CoV plays an important role in virus replication and is the primary target for drugs. The aim of this study is to develop 3D pharmacophore models for SARS-CoV main proteinase and expect to provide useful knowledge for anti-SARS drug design.",

            "text": "Indeed, among the 30 drugs are six compounds that already exhibited anti-SARS-CoV activity experimentally: azauridine, pyrazofurin, ribavirin, 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxycytidine, dideoxyguanosine, and 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxycytidine [4], [5]. This shows that our pharmacophore model can lead to the discovery of potent anti-SARS-CoV inhibitors or at least provide some useful clues. Fig. 4\nshows the mappings of the six compounds into the four-point pharmacophore model, which are mapped to 1\u20133 HBA, 1\u20132 HBD and 0\u20131 HPC. In addition, most of the remaining compounds have remarkable similarities with one of the above six compounds, for example, azauridine with 5-AZCR, alexan, arauridine and spongothymidin; 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxycytidine with emanil, fialuridine, floxuridin, radibud, thymidin and viroptic; dideoxyguanosine with angustmycin C, cordycepin, tubercidin, vengicide and vira-A. The superpositions for these compounds are shown in Fig. 5\n. In summary, our results indicate that the existing 30 drugs identified by our pharmacophore model could be potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV, or at least good lead compounds for anti-SARS-CoV drug design.",
