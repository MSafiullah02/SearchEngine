This list included a considerable amount of synonymy of the genera of Diaspidini by which many well-known genera were sunk and many others, including several of MacGillivray's genera, were fused without any apparently valid grounds. So far as the Ethiopian genera are concerned, the synonymy proposed has been disregarded except in one or two instances.",

Many of MacGillivray's genera have been accepted in this work and, in addition, it has been found necessary to create several new genera. The latter course has only been adopted with the greatest reluctance, but in the present state of our knowledge it is not possible to assign the species concerned to any of the known genera. Of the thirteen new genera created seven are a t the moment monotypical, but as the fauna becomes better known no doubt other species referable to them will be found. This view is strengthened by the knowledge that MacGillivray erected the genus Africaspis with only two included species-which have since been shown to be synonymous-yet eleven species have been referred to it in the present paper and it is now recognised as a well-established genus; the same applies to other genera erected by this author. Nevertheless it is realised that, as the number of species increases, gaps between certain genera may be bridged and lead to their fusion.",

It is actually very close to marchali Cockerell, of which, what is believed to be authentic material from the fruits of Elaeis guineensis from Dahomey has been compared with part of the type material of gossypii Newstead. The characters of the two species under the microscope are so much alike that no constant differences have been detected by which they can be separated. The scales of the adult female are, however, quite different, those of gossypii are very thin semitranslucent and pale brown, whilst those of rnarohali are white, neither so thin nor so semitransparent. Whether these differences are sufficiently constant to warrant considering the two species as distinct can only be determined by a better knowledge of the species of Pinnuspis occurring on Cotton and Elaeis. For the time being they are accepted as being distinct. P. rnarchali Cockerell is very close to P. temporaria Ferris (1942 : 407) but in the latter species the scale of the adult female is said to be opaque white.",

This synonymy is rejected and the view is held here that the only species referable to the genus are those in which the characters, apart from the mere presence of supplementary pore groups, are congeneric with P. media Maskell, the type of the genus.Five Ethiopian species have been assigned to Poliaspis in the past. In the author's opinion, not one of these is congeneric with media Maskell nor are they congeneric between themselves. Two at least are widely different from each other and the other three. Thus pariwrii Hall is placed in Afrimspis, argentuta Hall in Inchoaspis, mrissae Cockerell in Rolaspis and kiggelariae Brain and kiggelariae var. allophylli Hall in Temspis.Morrison (1922 : 88) considered kiggelariae Brain might be included in Poliaspis, but in the species in question the body is heavily sclerotised whereas in typical Poliaspis the body is membranous.Genus Protodiaspis Cockerell.",
