In the present days, the development of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic behavior of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is considered an important theme due to the quantity of infected people worldwide. In this work, the aim is to determine an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment considering real data from China. For this purpose, an inverse problem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of the compartmental SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model. To solve such inverse problem, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed. After this step, two optimal control problems (mono-and multi-objective) to determine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. The second considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment, i.e., a multi-objective optimal control problem. The solution of each optimal control problems is obtained using DE and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms, respectively. The results regarding the proposed multi-objective optimal control problem provides a set of evidences from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration can be chosen, according to a given criterion.",

These models are very important in different fields, such as policy making, emergency planning and risk assessment, definition of control-programs, promoting the improvement of various health-economic aspects (Al-Sheikh, 2013) . In general, such models aim to describe a state of infection (susceptible and infected) and a process of infection (the transition between these states) by using compartmental relations, i.e., the population is divided into compartments by taking assumptions about the nature and time rate of transfer from one compartment to another (Trawicki, 2017; Blackwood and Childs, 2018) . One can cite several studies using models for measles vaccination (Bauch et al., 2009; Widyaningsih et al., 2018) , HIV/AIDS (Mukandavire et al., 2009) , tuberculosis (Bowong and Kurths, 2010) , dengue (Weiss, 2013) , pertussis epidemiology (Pesco et al., 2014) , Alzheimer (Ebrahimighahnavieh et al., 2020) , among others.",

(2020) proposed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. These authors considered some essential elements including individual behavioral response, governmental actions, zoonotic transmission and emigration of a large proportion of the population in a short time period. Benvenuto et al. (2020) proposed the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to predict the spread, prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019. Roda et al. (2020) used a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model to predict the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine. In this study, these authors demonstrate that non-identifiability in model calibrations using the confirmedcase data is the main reason for such wide variations. Prem et al. (2020) proposed a SEIR model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan city. In this model, all demographic changes in the population (births, deaths and ageing) were ignored. The simulations showed that control measures aimed at reducing social mixing in the population can be effective in reducing the magnitude and delaying the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

It must be emphasized that there is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, but there is a huge effort to develop a vaccine in a record time, which justifies the present study (Lurie et al., 2020) . Mathematically, the determination of optimal protocol for vaccine administration characterizes an Optimal Control Problem (OCP). This particular optimization problem consists in the determination of control variable profiles that minimize (or maximize) a given performance index (Bryson and Ho, 1975; Biegler et al., 2002) . In order to solve this problem, several numerical methods have been proposed (Bryson and Ho, 1975; Feehery and Barton, 1996; Lobato, 2004; Lobato et al., 2016) . These methods are classified according to three broad categories: direct optimization methods, Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) based methods and HJB-based (Hamilton-Jacob-Bellman) methods. The direct approach is the most traditional strategy considered to solve an OCP, due to its simplicity. In this approach, the original problem is transformed into a finite dimensional optimization problem through the parametrization of control or parametrization of control and state variables (Feehery and Barton, 1996) .",

In this work, the propagation of a disease is controlled by a limited number of vaccines, while minimizing a percentage of the overall number of dead people by infection, and a cost associated with vaccination. Biswas et al. (2014) studied different mathematical formulations for an optimal control problem considering a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model. For this purpose, these authors evaluated the solution of such problems when mixed state control constraints are used to impose upper bounds on the available vaccines at each instant of time. In addition, the possibility of im-posing upper bounds on the number of susceptible individuals with and without limitations on the number of vaccines available were analyzed. The optimal control theory was applied to obtain optimal vaccination schedules and control strategies for the epidemic model of human infectious diseases.",

In order to determine the parameters that characterizes the proposed mathematical model (based on the compartmental SIR model), an inverse problem is formulated and solved considering the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm (Storn and Price, 1997; Price et al., 2005) . After this step, two optimal control problems (mono-and multi-objective) used to determine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment are proposed. The mono-objective optimal control problem considers minimizing the quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. On the other hand, the multi-objective optimal control problem considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment. To solve each problem, DE and Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms (Lobato and Steffen, 2011) are employed, respectively.",

The study of these models is very important to understand an epidemic spreading mechanism and, consequently, to investigate the transmission dynamics in population (Forgoston and Schwartz, 2013) . As mentioned by Keeling and Rohani (2007) , these compartmental models can be divided into two groups: i) population-based models and ii) agentbased or individual-based models. In turn, the first one can be subdivided into deterministic or stochastic (considering continuous time, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, delay differential equations or integrodifferential equations) or discrete time (represented by difference equations).

Due to the conflict between the objectives, there is no single point capable of optimizing all functions simultaneously. Instead, the best solutions that can be obtained are called optimal Pareto solutions, which form the Pareto curve (Deb, 2001) . The notion of optimality in a MOP is different from the one regarding optimization problems with a single objective. The most common idea about multi-objective optimization found in the literature was originally proposed by Edgeworth (1881) and further generalized by Pareto (1896) . One solution is said to be dominant over another, if it is not worse in any of the objectives, and if it is strictly better in at least one of the objectives. As an optimal Pareto solution dominates any other feasible point in the search space, all of these solutions are considered better than any other. Therefore, multi-objective optimization consists of finding a set of points that represents the best balance in relation to minimizing all objectives simultaneously, that is, a collection of solutions that relates the objectives, which are in conflict with each other, in most cases.",

Table 1 presents the results (best and standard deviation) obtained using DE. It is possible to observe that DE was able to obtain good estimates for the unknown parameters and, consequently, for the objective function, as can be verified, by visual inspection of Fig. 3 . These results were obtained, as mentioned earlier, from 20 runs. Thus, the values of the standard deviation demonstrate that the algorithm converges, practically, to the same optimum in all executions (best). Physically, the probability of transmission by contact in the Chinese population is superior to 35 % (\u03b2 equal to 0.3566). In addition, \u03b3 equal to 0.0858 implies a moderate per capita recovery rate. One must consider that, since many cases may not be reported, for different reasons, as for example an asymptomatic infected person, the value of I 0 may vary, as well as the behavior of the model over time. It is important to emphasize that when choosing I 0 as a design variable, the initial condition for the susceptible population (S 0 ) is automatically defined, that is, S 0 = 1 \u2212 I 0 , since there is not, at the beginning of an epidemic, a considerable number of recovered individuals and, thus, R 0 = 0 is a reasonable choice. In this case, the available data refer to the number of infected individuals and these represent only the portion of individuals in the population that have actually been diagnosed. This is due, among other facts, to the lack of tests to diagnose the disease of all individuals who present symptoms. Thus, as the number of susceptible individuals at the beginning of the epidemic is dependent on the value of I 0 , in this work it is considered that the total size of the population, typically defined as N = S + I + R, is actually a portion of the total population, since the number of infected individuals available is also a fraction of those who have actually been diagnosed. In this case, the results presented below represent only the fraction of the infected population that was diagnosed and, consequently, the fraction of individuals susceptible to contracting the disease. Qualitatively, the results presented are proportional to the number of individuals in the population who were diagnosed with the disease.",

As in the previous case, I 0 is chosen as the first reported data in relation to the number of infected individuals in the time series; Table 2 presents the best solution obtained by using DE and considering ten control elements, in terms of the number of individuals. The objective function obtained (about 8945.4278 individuals) is less than the case in which no control is considered (about 1594607.2234 individuals), i.e., the number of infected individuals is lower when a control strategy is considered (see Figs. 5(a) and 5(c)). If the number of infected individuals is reduced, due to control action, the number of susceptible individuals rapidly decreases until its minimum value (1.4382 \u00d7 10 \u22123 individuals) and, consequently, the number of recovered individuals rapidly increase until its maximum value (767.5187 individuals), as observed in Figs. 5(b) and 5(d), respectively. In terms of the action regarding the control variable, the effectiveness is readily verified in the beginning of the vaccine administration. Further the administration is conducted in specific intervals of time, which preserves the health of the population, as observed in Fig. 5(e) . The evolution of the number of vaccinated individuals is presented in Fig. 5(f) . In this case, due to control action, the vaccinated population increase rapidly until the value is saturated (141835.1405 individuals). In summary, all obtained profiles are coherent from the physical point of view. Finally, it is important to mention that the standard deviation for each result is, approximately, equal to 10 \u22123 , which demonstrates the robustness of DE to solve the proposed mono-objective optimal control problem. In this model, the evaluation of the number of vaccinated individuals is associated with an inequality constraint. This relation bounds the quantity of individuals that can be vaccinated due to the limitation related to the production of vaccines. For this purpose, two control elements are incorporated to the model: if W(t 1 ) \u2264 W lim , then u = 1. Otherwise, u = 0 (t 1 is the instant of time that W(t 1 ) = W lim , and W lim is the upper bound for the number of vaccinated individuals). Table 3 presents the results obtained considering different quantities for the parameter W lim . As expected, the insertion of this constraint implies in limiting the maximum number of vaccinated individuals and, consequently, a lower number of individuals are vaccinated. The increase of the parameter W lim implies in the reduction of the objective function value, in number of infected and recovered individuals and, consequently, an increase in the number of susceptible individuals. These analysis can be observed in Fig. 6 . ",

It must be stressed that the Pareto curve presents the non-dominated solutions, as described in Section 4.2. The point A represents the best solution in terms of the minimization of the number of infected individuals, with \u2126 1 = 8963.7775, that is, the number of infected individuals at t f assume its lowest value, which is equal to I(t f ) = 769.0921, but considering a larger amount of vaccine administered (\u2126 2 = 6.9358). On the other hand, the point B represents the best solution in terms of the quantity of vaccine administered, with \u2126 2 = 1.2940, i.e, the minimization of such value when t = t f . However, for this point, the number of infected individuals is high (\u2126 1 = 56644.0350). The point C is a compromise solution, which is a good solution in terms of both objectives simultaneously, with intermediary values for both objectives -\u2126 1 = 13298.2440 and \u2126 2 =2.3034. Table 4 . In Figure 7 (e) it is possible to observe the activation of the control variable when vaccine is introduced. Besides, in both results obtained, the action of such treatment is readily verified in the population during a larger interval of time in the beginning of the vaccine administration. In Figures 7(b) , 7(c), 7(d) and 7(f) the susceptible, infectious, recovered and number of vaccines profiles are presented, respectively, for each point described in Table 4 . In these figures we can visualize the importance of the control strategy used. For example, the points A and C are good choices in terms of the minimization of infected individuals, although the point A has a highest value in terms of the objective \u2126 2 . On the other hand, point B is satisfactory in terms of minimizing the amount of vaccines administered, but, from a clinical point of view, it is not a good choice, as the number of infected individuals is not minimized.",

The parameters of the compartmental SIR (Susceptible, Infectious and Recovered) model were determined by using Differential Evolution (DE). Considering the parameters obtained with the solution of the proposed inverse problem, two optimal control problems were proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals. In this case, an inequality that represents the quantity of vaccines available was analyzed. The second optimal control problem considers the minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment. This problem was solved using Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE). In general, the solution of the proposed multi-objective optimal control problem provides information from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration can be defined.",

It is important to emphasized that the quality of the results is dependent on experimental data considered. In this context, one may cite the following limitations regarding the SIR model: i) poor quality of reported official data and ii) the simplifications of the model, as for example terms as birth rate, differential vaccination rate, weather changes and its effect on the epidemiology. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the problem formulated in this work is not normally considered in the specialized literature (only the minimization of the infected individuals is normally proposed). In this context, the formulation of the multi-objective optimization problem and its solution by using MODE represents the main contribution of this work. ",
