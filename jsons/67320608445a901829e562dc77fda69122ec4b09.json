            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 has been emerged in December 2019 in China, causing deadly (5% mortality) pandemic pneumonia, termed COVID-19. More than one host-cell receptor is reported to be recognized by the viral spike protein, among them is the cell-surface Heat Shock Protein A5 (HSPA5), also termed GRP78 or BiP. Upon viral infection, HSPA5 is upregulated, then translocating to the cell membrane where it is subjected to be recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 spike. In this study, some natural product compounds are tested against the HSPA5 substrate-binding domain b (SBDb), which reported to be the recognition site for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations are used to test some natural compounds binding to HSPA5 SBDb. The results show high to a moderate binding affinity for the phytoestrogens (Diadiazin, Genistein, Formontein, and Biochanin A), chlorogenic acid, linolenic acid, palmitic acid, caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, hydroxytyrosol, cis-p-Coumaric acid, cinnamaldehyde, thymoquinone, and some physiological hormones such as estrogens, progesterone, testosterone, and cholesterol to the HSPA5 SBDb. Based on its binding affinities, the phytoestrogens and estrogens are the best in binding HSPA5, hence may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the stressed cells. These compounds can be successful as anti-COVID-19 agents for people with a high risk of cell stress like elders, cancer patients, and front-line medical staff.",

Pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, is suspected to be due to the first animal to human transmission in a seafood market in Wuhan city in November 2019 (Hui et al., 2020; Parr, 2020 ) . On 20 January 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed the human-to-human route for virus transmission (Hui et al., HSP5A is the master of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Ibrahim et al., 2019) .HSPA5 is responsible for protein homeostasis in the lumen of the ER. Upon cell stress, such as under the condition of viral infection or in the case of cancer cells, HSPA5 is upregulated and translocated to the cytoplasm and cell membrane complexing with other proteins (Al-Hashimi et al., 2018; Chen & Xu, 2017; Misra et al., 2005; Nain et al., 2017; Pujhari et al., 2017) . HSPA5 is reported to be cell-surface exposed and responsible for pathogen entry (such as the fungus Rhizopus oryzae and many viruses like Human Papillomavirus, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and human coronaviruses) (Elfiky, 2019; Elfiky, 2020a; Elfiky, 2020b; Ibrahim et al., 2019; Ibrahim et al., 2020; Pujhari et al., 2017) .",

Figure 2A shows Figure 3A shows the average binding affinities of different natural compounds to the HSPA5 SBDb four different conformations with the error bars representing the standard deviations (SD). Pep42 (red column) is a cyclic peptide that recognizes explicitly cell-surface HSPA5 in vivo (Ibrahim et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2006) . The average binding affinity of Pep42 is -6.73 \u00b1 1.13 kcal/mol, which is used here as a reference to judge other compounds' binding affinities. Phytoestrogens (green columns) show excellent average binding energies to HSPA5 ranging from -6.98 \u00b1 0.19 kcal/mol (biochanin A) up to -7.80 \u00b1 0.91 kcal/mol (daidzein). Compared to Pep42, the phytoestrogens have at least the same binding affinity to HSPA5 SBDb. This means that a dietary supplement of phytoestrogens (found in Cicer arietinum) may contradict the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike to the cell-exposed HSPA5 preventing its recognition by the virus.",

This pattern of HSPA5 binding affinities is in good agreement with the previous reports of the antagonistic effect of unsaturated fatty acids, chlorogenic and linoleic acids, against the saturated, palmitic, fatty acid which induces ER stress (Katsoulieris et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2012) . Palmitic, linoleic, and chlorogenic acids may be used to counteract the SARS-CoV-2 recognition of the host cell-surface HSPA5 and hence may reduce the viral attachment. Additionally, the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid, may be used to target stressed HSPA5-exposed cells (viral infected or cancer cell) and induce ER stress leading to cell apoptosis.",

Hydroxytyrosol succeeded in a previous study as a prophylactic agent against myocardial infarction-mediated apoptosis . For the caffeic and p-Coumaric acids (light blue columns), that are found in grape skin, the average binding affinities to HSPA5 SBDb are \u00c06.3 \u00b1 0.60 and \u00c05.63 \u00b1 0.57 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are slightly less than Pep42 (\u00c06.73 \u00b1 1.13 kcal/mol), but the differences are not significant. Caffeic and p-Coumaric acids may bind to cell-surface HSPA5 competing for its recognition by viral spike protein and contradict the attachment. The same effect can be concluded from the caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) (dark blue column) that can be found in honeybee hive propolis (average binding affinity to HSPA5 SBDb is -7.13 \u00b1 0.95 kcal/mol). This . The average binding affinity (in kcal/mol) calculated using AutoDock Vina software for the docking of the natural products bioactive compounds (A) and physiological compounds (B) into the four different conformations of the HSPA5 SBDb. The cyclic peptide Pep42 (red column) is used as a reference due to its specificity in binding HSPA5 in vivo. Estrogens and phytoestrogen are among the best binders to HSPA5 SBDb. One docking trial is selected here to represent one conformation of the HSPA5 during 50 ns MDS. Bold residues are interacting through p-Stacking, while underlined residues are forming salt bridges. One docking trial is selected here to represent one conformation of the HSPA5 during 50 ns MDS. Bold residues are interacting through p-Stacking. average binding energy value is better than the highly selective cyclic peptide, Pep42, which indicates the potential of CAPE as an HSPA5 SBDb binder. Additionally, CAPE was reported to induce ER stress in an autophagy-dependent manner in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma (Tanida et al., 2008; Tomiyama et al., 2018) . Cinnamaldehyde (cyan column) and thymoquinone (violet column) show \u00c06.25 \u00b1 1.10 and \u00c05.520 \u00b1 0.12 kcal/mol average binding energies to HSPA5 SBDb. These binding energies are comparable to the Pep42 cyclic peptide (\u00c06.73 \u00b1 1.13 kcal/mol) and hence the active components of cinnamon and the seeds of Nigella sativa may tightly bind to cell-surface HSPA5 and could be successful in contradicting SARS-CoV-2 spike recognition and attachment. Not only the natural compounds can bind HSPA5 SBDb with high affinity, but also other physiological molecules. Figure 3B shows the average binding affinities for the binding of estrogens (estriol and estradiol), cholesterol, progesterone, testosterone, and hydrocortisone (cortisol) to HSPA5 SBDb. As implicated from the binding energy values, all the physiological compounds can tightly bond the HSPA5 SBDb with values ranges from -7.20 \u00b1 0.58 kcal/mol (Hydrocortisone) up to -8.40 \u00b1 0.98 kcal/mol (estradiol). These values are lower (better) than that of the Pep42 cyclic peptide, which reported to target cell-surface HSPA5 (GRP78) in vivo selectively. It is important here to point out that HSPA5 SBDb may act as a receptor for such hormones. The binding energies indicate that cell-surface HSPA5 may be critical for these hormones recognition and hence internalization which not only may downregulate the concentration of cell-surface HSPA5, and its associated chemotherapeutic resistance, but also may play an essential role in hormone internalization for cell-signaling (Niu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015) . As a consequence, these hormones may also be used as protective molecules during chemotherapy to revert the chemoresistance of the HSPA5 presenting cancer cells.",

Two types of interactions are dominant, the H-bonding and the hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, p-stacking (residues in bold in the tables) is reported between the residue F451 and the estrogens (estriol and estradiol), phytoestrogens (daidzein, genistein, and formononetin), caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), and cis-p-Coumaric acid. Also, salt bridges (underlined residues in Table 1 ) are formed between the residue K460 and both linolenic acid and cis-p-Coumaric acid. Hydrophobic interactions are more dominant compared to the H-bonding, as can be seen from almost all the natural and physiological compounds. This is in good agreement with previous reports defining the function of HSPA5 SBDb in the lumen of ER as to recognize unfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER mediating its degradation or refolding using cellular machinery (Ibrahim et al., 2019; Pfaffenbach & Lee, 2011; Roller & Maddalo, 2013) . On the other hand, hydrocortisone and chlorogenic acid have more H-bonds than hydrophobic interactions (5:3 and 7:5 for hydrocortisone and chlorogenic acid, respectively). Additionally, caffeic acid forms four H-bonds and four hydrophobic contacts with the HSPA5 SDBb. Figure 4 shows the interaction analysis made by the PLIP web server for the docked structures of HSPA5 to estrogen (estradiol) (A), phytoestrogens (daidzein) (B), and biochanin A (C) as an example. The HSPA5 is shown in colored surface representations with its domains labeled. The ligands are represented in yellow sticks, where it appears how it fit in the binding site groove of the SBDb. Enlarged views of the binding sites show how the interactions established upon docking. Residues in the binding site of HSPA5 SBDb are represented in blue sticks and labeled with its one-letter code. In Figure 4 , the hydrophobic interactions are described in dashed-gray lines, while H-bonds and p-stacking are depicted in solid blue lines and dashed-green lines, respectively. Docking scores are listed to reflect a binding affinity for each complex. Noticeably, the interacting residues are mainly hydrophobic, while hydrophobic interactions are dominant all the docking complexes. For estradiol, only one H-bond is formed through T458, while none is reported in daidzein. On the other hand, the biochanin A-HSPA5 complex show 5 Hbonds. Estradiol and daidzein but not biochanin A form p-stacking with residue F451 of HSPA5.",

Additionally, I tried to dock the small molecules-HSPA5 complexes to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein model, but the spike doesn't fit the HSPA5 binding site; this may be due to the presence of the small molecules in the SBDb of HSPA5. The small molecules prevent the spike from binding to HSPA5 SBDb in silico. The results support the effectiveness of natural products and physiological hormones to block HSPA5 SDBb, preventing SARS-CoV-2 spike recognition (see the graphical abstract).

The system is equilibrated starting from about 15 ns, where the RMSD is fluctuating around 5 \u00c5, RoG is fluctuates around 30 \u00c5, while SASA values are increasing slowly until 30 ns where the SASA values equilibrated at about 32000 \u00c5 2 .
