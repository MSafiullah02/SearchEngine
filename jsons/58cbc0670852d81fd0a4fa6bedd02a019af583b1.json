Methods The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>6 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, and prevalence of sleep disturbances between FMW and non-FMW. Results A total of 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3\u00b13.8 vs 7.5\u00b13.7; P\uff1c0.001; Cohen's d=0.47), AIS (6.9\u00b14.3 vs 5.3\u00b13.8; P\uff1c0.001; Cohen's d=0.38), anxiety (4.9\u00b12.7 vs 4.3\u00b12.6; P\uff1c0.001; Cohen's d= 0.22) and depression (4.1\u00b12.5 vs 3.6\u00b12.4; P=0.001; Cohen's d=0.21), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances according to PSQI > 6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; relative risk [RR]= 1.29; P\uff1c0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; RR=1.45; P\uff1c0.001). Conclusion FMW have higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-FMW. Further interventions should be administrated for FMW, aiming to maintain their healthy condition and guarantee their professional performance in the battle against COVID-19.",

PSQI is a self-reported questionnaire which assesses subjective sleep quality within one month. A subject with a total score > 6 7 points is defined as poor sleep quality. The higher the PSQI, the worse the sleep quality [9] . The AIS is a brief instrument to assess the severity of insomnia. It contains eight items with each item rated from 0 to 3 points [10] . A subject with a total score > 6 points screens positive for insomnia. The higher the AIS, the more severe the insomnia [11] .
