The largest survey of infections was reported in 1976 by Pike [3], who found that 4079 laboratory-acquired infections were due to 159 agents, although 10 agents accounted for >50% of the cases (table 1) [3, 4]. At least 173 deaths have resulted from laboratory-acquired infection [5, 6]. However, care should be taken in the interpretation of historical surveys, because some infections (e.g., Q fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and dermatomycoses) occurred predominantly in research and animal laboratories, and many of these infections (e.g., psittacosis and typhoid) were reported before 1955 [1, 3].",

Similar results were obtained from a survey of clinical microbiology laboratories in Utah from the period 1978\u20131992, with shigellosis reported to be the most common laboratory-acquired infection [10].

This finding undoubtedly reflects an improved awareness of the hazards of working with infectious agents and placement of a greater emphasis on laboratory safety, such as through the use of personal protective equipment. In addition, there have been improvements in laboratory design, such as the use of laminar-flow biological safety cabinets (BSCs), which provide unidirectional airflow that entraps any aerosolized particles in the airstream and subsequently into air filters [12].",

In the United States, Brucella infection is one of the most common laboratory-acquired infections, accounting for 24% of laboratory-acquired bacterial infections and 11% of deaths due to laboratory infection [20]. Aerosolization is the major source of transmission, but the bacterium can also be transmitted via direct contact. However, in many reported cases, it has not been possible to accurately determine the mechanism for transmission. The disease has also affected janitors and persons who have made brief visits to the laboratory [21]. Person-to-person transmission is rare, although a case of Brucella infection transmitted from a laboratory worker to a spouse has been documented, presumably through sexual intercourse [22].",

In a report from Canada, 26 laboratory workers were exposed to Brucella melitensis, which had been isolated from a patient from India with a draining chest sinus. Six laboratory workers were offered PEP with doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) and rifampin (600 mg daily) for 3 weeks. Only 1 person declined PEP; 10 weeks after exposure, the technologist developed fever (temperature, \u2a7d40\u00b0C), and 2 sets of blood cultures confirmed brucellosis. None of the other laboratory workers developed infection or evidence of seroconversion. Follow-up serologic tests should be performed for all exposed individuals, probably every fortnight for the first 3 months, then every month for an additional 6\u20139 months [13, 18].",

Sixteen cases of probable laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease were identified, including 6 cases in the United States. Nine cases (56%) were due to serogroup B, and 7 (44%) were due to serogroup C. Overall, 8 cases (50%) were fatal. All cases occurred among clinical microbiologists and were likely due to exposure to aerosols containing N. meningitidis. The calculated attack rate was 13 cases per 100,000 microbiologists, compared with an attack rate of 0.3 cases per 100,000 persons among the general population.

The use of laminar-flow BSCs for aerosol-generating manipulations with biosafety level \u2a7e2 practices and fit-tested respirators with N-95 rating should be routinely used [12, 29]. Laboratory personnel should undergo an annual Mantoux purified protein derivative skin test or an interferon-\u03b3 release assay to demonstrate conversion. Persons with positive test results should be evaluated for active tuberculosis by chest radiography. In the event of accidental exposure, laboratory workers should be tested 3 and 6 months after the accident, and persons with new conversion should be offered prophylaxis [29].",

Data on occupational transmission of HIV from the period 1981\u20131992 revealed a total of 32 health care workers in the United States with occupationally acquired HIV infection; 25% of these health care workers were laboratory workers [43]. In the event of laboratory-based exposure from a source person with HIV infection, or if information suggests the likelihood that the source person is HIV infected, immediate referral to employee health for HIV PEP should be sought [44].",

Exposures may occur inadvertently, may not even be recalled, or may result from lapses in technique leading to accidental inoculation. However, not every exposure results in infection. A risk assessment for infection based on the host's immune system, mechanism of the exposure, infectious dose of the exposure, virulence of the agent, use of personal protective equipment, and immunization status needs to be performed. The accurate quantification of such risk is unfortunately difficult, because there is no systematic reporting system that monitors the number of laboratory-related exposures and infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently convened a committee to address these issues that will, I hope, provide evidence-based guidelines on exposure risk and use of PEP.",
