Consistent with these results, previous studies have found a lower reactivity to stress in older adults (e.g., Birditt, Fingerman, & Almeida, 2005) , that may be related to resilience (Ong, Bergeman, Bisconti, & Wallace, 2006) , or to a more effective emotion regulation ability, involving more use of preventive and emotion-focused strategies (e.g., Charles & Carstensen, 2007) . However, as expected, negative self-perceptions of aging were found to be strongly associated with emotional outcomes. This central role of negative self-perceptions of aging in the explanation of loneliness and distress identified in this study provides additional support for its importance as a dimension associated with negative outcomes, and supports an interesting combination of both the embodiment theory (Levy, 2009 ) and the stress and coping model (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) . The fact that the strength of association between negative self-perception of aging and loneliness and distress decreases (although still significant) in the fourth step of the model (when personal resources are included) could be suggesting an interesting mediation role of personal resources in the relationship between negative self-perceptions of aging with loneliness and psychological distress. These findings seem to support previous results reported by Levy and Myers (2004) , who found that positive self-perceptions of aging were related to engagement in more preventive health behaviors, and by Bellingtier and Neupert (2018) , who found that older A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 adults with more negative attitudes toward own aging reported increased emotional reactivity to stressors.",

A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 years old, in our study most of the participants were women. In addition, although the percentage of participants from the age ranges of 30 to 44, and 45 to 59 is similar to the general population distribution, a higher proportion of participants was obtained for the age range of 18 to 29, and a lower proportion for the range of 60 and older. Also, older adults who participate in this study are users of online technologies and may not therefore be representative of the general older adult population, something that may be acting as a confounding variable in this study (as well as in similar studies done in the context of COVID-19; Zhong et al., 2020) . Even though studies exist that provide support for the use of single-items in surveys and even clinical contexts (e.g., Zimmerman et al., 2006) , the use of single-items for measuring the wide-ranging effects of the lock-down situation in the context of individuals and families through a brief and easy to answer measure is a limitation of the study. The internal consistency of the self-perceptions of aging scale, although similar to that reported in other studies (e.g., Siebert, Wahl, Degen, & Schr\u00f6der, 2018) , is low. Regarding the psychological distress measure, even though a good internal consistency was found, future studies are needed to support the validity and reliability of the measure. Despite the fact that the obtained percentage of explained variance of loneliness and psychological distress is high, other variables that can also contribute to distress in this scenario were not measured, such as perceived susceptibility and confusion about information reliability (Qian et al., 2020) , knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 (Zhong et al., 2020) , or uncertainty about the future (including potential health or economic issues).",
