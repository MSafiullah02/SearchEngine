Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptorligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation. This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real-life actors in COVID-19.",

The ACE2 gene (which is located on X chromosome) is characterized by a large polymorphism, and significant associations between polymorphisms and occurrence of arterial hypertension have been reported for women of different race and ethnicity and in Han Chinese men [10] [11] . More recently, the combination of ACE1 and ACE2 polymorphisms has been associated with susceptibility to hypertension in Brazilian patients [12] . Within the Chinese population, the polymorphism distribution seems different between regions; polymorphisms of ACE2 are associated with different blood pressure response to the cold pressor test. An enhanced response is associated with polymorphisms more frequently observed in northern regions of China, and lowered response with polymorphisms more frequently observed in southern regions. This observation leads the authors to speculate that this was a consequence of exposure to different climatic conditions, possibly because of adaptive selection over generations [10, 13] . Furthermore, ACE2 polymorphism is correlated to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, septal wall thickness, ventricular hypertrophy, and coronary artery disease in Asian populations [14] . However, whether ACE2 polymorphism is associated with a different susceptibility to Covid-19 infection or its severity is still speculative.",

Although chronic lung damage induced by smoking would increase susceptibility to severe forms of viral pneumonia, available literature strongly suggests that nicotine upregulates the detrimental angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) but downregulates the compensatory ACE2/ANG-(1-7) receptor axis [21] . Thus, the hypothesis that cigarette smoking is either detrimental or provides a counterintuitive protective effect, warrants specific epidemiologic and clinical studies. A preliminary meta-analysis indicates that active smoking is not associated with severity of coronavirus disease [22] . The possible downregulation of ACE2 associated with a possible decrease of the virus-binding sites may counteract the general increased susceptibility to lung diseases usually observed in smokers.",

In animal models, the loss of ACE2 resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NADPH oxidase 2 activation, and administration of recombinant ACE2 was shown to inhibit the angiotensin II effects on TGF-\u03b21 activation and collagen production [14] . Recombinant ACE2 pulmonary overexpression attenuates whole aspects of pulmonary artery hypertension pathophysiology [23] , suggesting that its loss of function (as could occur in case of massive binding by viral particles, with subsequent endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage [24] ) could participate in the severity of respiratory distress. More importantly, loss of function of ACE2 cannot counterbalance the deleterious effects of Angiotensin II in promoting degradation of cardiac and lung structures and function [24] . Thus, angiotensin II receptor blockers could also potentially exert a protective action in the late phases of SARS COVID-19 by counteracting the negative effects of Angiotensin II.",

            "text": "Arterial hypertension medications: The urgent need of reflection should take into account the effect of medications on ACE2 synthesis, expression, and action whose theoretical impact on COVID-19 prevention, infection, severity, and management would be not negligible. Hypertension involves 1.39 billion people worldwide, 349 million in highincome and 1.04 billion in low-and middle-income countries. However, large discrepancies in exposure to antihypertensive drugs worldwide exist: the awareness, treatment, and control concern 67%, 56%, and 28% of patients in high income, and 37%, 29%, and 7.7% of patients in low-and middle-income countries [25] . Most patients with arterial hypertension and/or cardiac failure are treated by ACE1 inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (sartans). Prescription of sartans increases each year in high-income countries, and are probably the most frequently prescribed drugs in diabetic patients with hypertension. These medications increase gene expression of ACE2 in rats [26] . Although there are no indications to date that the same situations occurs in humans, this could result in increased binding site for COVID-19 in non-infected cases and in the diffusion phases of viral infection, but, as stated above, could represent part of a therapeutic armamentarium in severely ill patients with compromised cardiorespiratory function. This therapeutic opportunity has been suggested by the 19 march 2020 joint statement of HFSA/ACC/AHA [27] . In this statement, discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or sartans was discouraged for those patients currently prescribed, but the idea of updating these recommendations in the case of evolution in further research and developments was set. A warning signal on the possible impact of these drugs has been published in an authoritative journal [1] .",

It should be emphasized that chloroquine has been advocated as a potentially effective drug to be administered in CIVID-19 associated pneumonia [28] . In vitro models showed that inhibitory effects are observed either before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages [29] . Chloroquine acts by elevating the endosomal pH, and interferes with terminal glycosylation of ACE2, thus negatively influencing the SARS virus-receptor binding as indicated in 2005 by in vitro studies [29] . In the early phase of infection with SARS-Cov-2, chloroquine could reduce the binding of the virus to ACE2 on alveolar lung cells membrane and possibly without interfering with ACE2 function. This would result in a reduction of direct viral cytotoxicity without unbalancing the complex equilibrium of the ACE system especially in the setting of ACE2 overexpression. Ongoing randomized trials will answer the question of usefulness of this medication.",
