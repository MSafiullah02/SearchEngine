The spread of the disease started from the northern regions of Italy, Lombardy and Veneto on the 21st of February 2020: after about twenty positive cases, two small areas had been put in quarantine but, since then, the number of infected increased exponentially in this two districts. From the localities situated farthest south in Lombardy the disease spread in closest regions, Emilia-Romagna above all, with the provinces of Piacenza, Parma, Modena, Rimini, but soon after also in other provinces of Lombardy (e.g. in the province of Bergamo). On the 8th of March a lockdown for the entire region of Lombardy (with a population of about 10 millions of inhabitants) and other fourteen provinces (population of about six millions of inhabitants) was imposed by the central government of Italy and then extended, on the 9th of March, to the entire country. Up to the 23rd of March, the total number of infected is 63927, of which 28761 in the Lombardy region. Since the start of the epidemic in China, a certain number of studies appeared in the mathematical community about this subject: the description of the spatial or temporal diffusion of the infected in given regions [4] , [8] - [10] , the transmission dynamics of the infection [6] , the economic and financial consequences of the epidemic [1] , the effect of atmospheric indicators on the spread of the virus [5] , are only a fraction of the topics under investigation in these days.",

The characteristics of this model are well-known and the interested readers can look for example at the discussions in the classical books of Braun [2] and Murrray [11] . Here we will make only few observations, relevant for the next sections. Some authors do not include the denominator N on the right hand side of (1), since it is a constant and can be absorbed by a re-definition of the parameter r. However, we will keep it: in this way it is evident the scaling property of this model: if the initial conditions (S 0 , I 0 , R 0 ) are scaled by a common constant factor \u03b1, (and so the total population is scaled by a factor \u03b1), the solution is scaled by the same factor. Some temporal properties of this model, like the time corresponding to a maximum in I (the time of the peak of the infected), do not depend on the scaling. This property is very useful, since the actual number of infected or susceptible (and then of recovered) is in general not known. The reasonable assumption that the same fraction (with respect to the total) of infected, susceptible and recovered individuals are known, gives the possibility, in this case, to compare the measured data with the properties that are scale-independent.",

The value of the number of infected can be obtained by derivation, i.e. I(t) = \u03b1\u03b2sech(\u03b2t \u2212 c) 2 . When considering the cumulative number of infected, R + I, the contribution of sech 2 is negligible on the tails, whereas it is more pronounced in correspondence of the maximum of sech 2 , but it is however small if the value of the parameter \u03b2 is less than one.

The cumulative total number of infected that will be considered in the next lines are those of entire Italy territory. There are at least two reasons that suggested to not take regional or local data: the first one is that the epidemic started to spread across three different regions (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna) and there could not be a correspondence between the locality where a certain fraction of inhabitants reside and the region where this fraction was infected. This is also true at a national level, but the fraction is assumed to be smaller. The second reason is that a non negligible number of workers and students moved, just before the lockdown, from the regions in the north of Italy to their regions of origin in the center and south of Italy. The possibility that a non negligible flow of infected people passed from the north to other regions should be taken into consideration.

Clearly the model used here is rough, but it can give at least an idea about the future trend of the data. We are tacitly assuming that there will be no other cluster of infection around Italy in the next days: the point will be discussed later. Now we consider the function f in (3) as a function of t and c alone, since the value of a is constrained by the curve (6) . The plot of the derivative of this function (with respect to t) gives the time of the peak of infections. The plot is reported in figure (7): we notice that the maximum of the derivative of the cumulative number of infected increases with n up to c \u223c 4.15 and then decreases by increasing c. This gives an upper bound for the peak of new number of infected (the point where the second derivative of f (t) (3) is zero), given by 32 days after the first infection.

The hypothesis about the scale invariance of the underlying model (that, we repeat, not necessarily is represented by the SIR model) is fundamental for the accuracy of the result. Another underlying assumption is that the restrictive measures will be kept and observed in the next days and there will be no other clusters in the south of Italy (in the SIR model language, the values of S 0 are below the epidemic threshold, see e.g. [11] ). In the unfortunate case that there will be other clusters, it is possible to think at a substitution of the tanh curve by a combination of such functions: if there are two clusters of comparable magnitude, then we will have f (t) = \u03b1 1 tanh(\u03b2 1 t \u2212 c 1 ) + \u03b1 1 tanh(c 1 ) + \u03b1 2 tanh(\u03b2 2 t \u2212 c 2 ) + \u03b1 2 tanh(c 2 )",
