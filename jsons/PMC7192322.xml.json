As part of an academic medical center in an area that was highly impacted by COVID-19, our gastroenterology (GI) fellowship program was faced with a myriad of new challenges. As with other Accreditation Council for Graduate Medication Education (ACGME)-accredited programs, the early course required a quick response that minimized exposure of trainees to the virus while maintaining adequate clinical coverage. As a GI training program, we had the additional goals of meeting learning objectives and also the technical aspects of a procedural-based specialty.",

In addition to reducing team size, we also worked with the primary services to limit the number of consults to those deemed most necessary. Any remaining cognitive consultations that did not require direct patient evaluation were converted to virtual consults (either voice or video) as appropriate. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who did require direct evaluation for consultation were seen only by the service attending.",

Hospital policy dictated that any provider exposed to a COVID-positive patient without appropriate PPE was to undergo a period of quarantine. Moreover, the number of asymptomatic carriers for COVID-19 and the high concern of exposure had already resulted in quarantine for team members seeing the same patients, per above. Thus, we aimed to minimize overlapping of team members. While our standard is a staggered weekly schedule between attendings and fellows that minimized team handoffs, we decided to assign a fellow to an attending at each site and have them switch in tandem. In case of an exposure or team member who would test positive, a necessitated team quarantine would only impact two providers at a time in this new system. We also created a schedule wherein each fellow was on service for only a week at a time with a week break, in order to minimize cumulative exposure per fellow, given that cumulative exposure increases the risk of infection [3].",

This system exposed up to 8 fellows per week to one of the three hospitals. We addressed this by separating the call duties into two tracks: one fellow is on \u2018tele-call,\u2019 where they answer all calls from all three hospitals from home, and triage appropriately; the fellow on service for the week is on \u2018travel call\u2019 on nights in tandem with partnering service attending, only to be called if there is an urgent case requiring hospital exposure. The tele-call triaging allows the travel-call fellow to rest most of the nights, given they are on call for more nights of the week in this system. To date, we have not had any overnight cases, providing the travel-call fellows with adequate rest.",

Following rounds, formalized teaching by the service attending and participating fellows consolidated concepts from the hospitalized patients.
