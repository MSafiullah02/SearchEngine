The largest study, using a large nationwide sample of COVID-19 patients in China, found that those with multiple comorbidities had more than twice the risk of a severe outcome or death compared with patients with no comorbidities, after adjusting for age and smoking (HR=2.59, 95% CI 1.61, 4.17).",

Other countries have reported similar findings as the pandemic has spread (5, 6) . Given that the prevalence of comorbidity increases with age, it is unclear whether and how comorbidity independently influences risk of COVID-19 progression. Many early studies into the epidemiology of COVID-19 reported baseline comorbidities of hospitalised patients but not age-adjusted estimates of excess risk associated with comorbidities. Understanding the relationship between comorbidity and COVID-19 outcomes would enhance planning capabilities and potentially our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, management, and prognosis.",

The findings of this review are consistent with the hypothesis that comorbidity also predisposes individuals to poorer outcomes in this current COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst the mechanisms remain poorly understood, there are numerous biologically plausible explanations. The pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 is thought to involve dysregulated proinflammatory immune response and subsequent multi-system damage (23) . Many underlying conditions may leave affected individuals more vulnerable to the effects of this. Obesity, for example, tends to reduce lung function and dysregulate the immune system (24) . Similarly, diabetes mellitus can impair immune function (25) , as do many cancer treatments. Patients with pre-existing hypertension and other CVD may be at heightened risk of severe outcomes through various mechanisms, including therapeutic upregulation of ACE2 (the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2), and greater vulnerability to hyperinflammatory immune responses and cardiac complications that are common with severe COVID-19 (26, 27) .",

In those studies, it is possible that the clinical predictors are intermediates on pathways through which comorbidity elevates the risk of death from COVID-19.

If a vaccine becomes available, prioritisation of vaccination should be based on risk. In terms of secondary prevention of COVID-19, early COVID-19 detection must be promoted amongst those with comorbidities, to take advantage of any effective treatments that are developed. In terms of tertiary prevention, evidence of elevated risk of severe outcomes can also inform decisions around triage, patient management, treatment (prioritisation and care provision). It may also point to a need for differential approaches to the care of recovered and recovering COVID-19 patients with comorbidities, due to their additional needs. In terms of resource allocation, the evidence of increased risk associated with comorbidities has implications for healthcare system demand in areas of high comorbidity prevalence. To address the greater burden of COVID-19 in communities with more preexisting conditions, greater resources will be needed in these communities. Current approaches, however, are not sufficiently taking into account the higher levels of need experienced by some communities due to comorbidities (34) . This emerging evidence also has implications for the preparation for second and subsequent waves of community transmission. In addition to careful management of people with chronic conditions to minimise risk over the longer reach of this pandemic, it also highlights an added urgency for reducing the prevalence and incidence of comorbidities, through greater support for prevention efforts and addressing the wider determinants of health.",

Recent data from the Office of National Statistics in the UK also showed that COVID-19 mortality rates are more than twice as high in the most deprived parts of England than in the least deprived areas (35) . Deprivation increases the risk of poor health; higher levels of comorbidity in more disadvantaged groups is likely to be driving some of these COVID-19 inequalities, but social factors may also be playing a role (such as overcrowded housing, employment in essential occupations, particularly public-facing roles or others where physical distancing is not feasible, and greater reliance on public transport). Also in the UK, people from ethnic minority backgrounds are overrepresented among deaths from COVID-19 (36) , with evidence that ethnicity is a risk factor independent of deprivation (37) . Some of this disparity is likely to be due to the higher prevalence of common comorbidities in some of these groups. People with chronic health conditions, already disadvantaged and underrepresented in the workforce, are also more likely to be disadvantaged by the control measures. Without an effective vaccine or treatment many are likely to be isolated or shielded, and .

Our review highlights that there are potentially people with chronic conditions across all age groups, such as younger people with Type 1 diabetes, conflated with older people. As far as is possible, people need support tailored to their need. Rather than being a 'great leveller', this pandemic highlights the potential consequences of existing health inequalities and uneven distribution of underlying health conditions. Without concerted effort, the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to widening health inequalities between social, ethnic, and geographical groups. Responses to the pandemic must therefore prioritise and mitigate the unfair burden shouldered by disadvantaged and ethnic minority groups.",

It summarises for clinicians, policymakers, and academics the most robust evidence to date on this topic, to inform patient management and resource allocation for tackling the pandemic. Given the intersection of comorbidity with ethnicity and social disadvantage, these findings also have important implications for health inequalities. As the pandemic develops, further research is required to confirm these trends in other settings outside China and to explore the mechanisms by which various underlying health conditions increase risk of severe COVID-19.",
