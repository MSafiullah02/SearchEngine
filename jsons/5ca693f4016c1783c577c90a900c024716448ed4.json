            "text": "Coronavirus disease was first diagnosed in Wuhan in December 2019. The World Health Organization defined the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide as a public health emergency of international concern. Epidemiological data indicate that at least 20% of COVID-19 patients have severe disease. In addition to impairment of the respiratory system, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication. Immune damage mediated by cytokine storms and concomitant AKI is a key factor for poor prognosis. Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19. This protocol is divided into four major steps. The first step is to assess whether patients with severe COVID-19 require blood purification. The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19. The third step is to monitor and adjust parameters of blood purification. The fourth step is to evaluate the timing of discontinuation of blood purification. It is expected that blood purification will play a key role in effectively reducing the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 through the standardized implementation of the present protocol.",

So far, more than 70,000 cases have been confirmed in China. According to reports in the literature, the proportions of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 are 13.8% and 4.7%, respectively, and the overall crude case fatality rate is approximately 2.3%. 2 At present, the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 have entered critical stage, and the effective treatment of severe and critically ill patients is the key to reducing associate mortality. The \"Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Sixth Edition)\" 3 and \"Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Severe and Critical Cases of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial)\" 4 both mention that in addition to active oxygen therapy and respiratory support, circulatory monitoring and support, nutritional support treatment, occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) should be evaluated in a timely manner. For critically ill patients with high inflammatory response, plasma purification, absorption, perfusion, blood/plasma filtration, and other blood purification techniques should be performed if possible.",

Flow cytometry revealed that the CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe cell counts in peripheral blood were greatly reduced; however, the double high positive ratios of human leukocyte antigen-DR (CD4 3.47%) and CD38 (CD8 39.4%) confirmed the simultaneous existence of lymphocyte hyperactivation. 6 In addition, the number of highly proinflammatory CCR4 \u00fe CCR6 \u00fe Th17 cells increased, and CD8 \u00fe T cells demonstrated high cytotoxicity owing to their excessive activation, proving that cytokine stormmediated immune injury is a key factor that leads to disease aggravation and a poor prognosis.",

It has been reported that the incidence rate of ARDS among patients with COVID-19 ranges from 17% to 29%, 7e9 thus requiring different degrees of respiratory support. Studies have shown that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 may bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, thereby damaging target organs. ACE2 is highly expressed in the kidney, nearly 100 times higher than that in the respiratory tract, theoretically suggesting that the kidney is also a major target organ of COVID-19. 10 Data from a clinical study of 59 patients with COVID-19 (including 28 severe cases) showed that 63% of patients had proteinuria (mild, 47%; moderate, 10%; severe, 6%); 27% of patients with COVID-19 had elevated urea nitrogen levels and 19% of patients with COVID-19 had elevated serum creatinine levels. 11 Three recently published clinical studies showed that the incidence rate of AKI among patients with COVID-19 was 3e7% and that 1.5%e9.0% of patients required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Among those patients, the incidence rates of AKI among patients with severe disease and critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit were significantly increased, ranging from 8.3% to 23.0%, and the proportion of patients who required CRRT was 5.6%e 23.0%. The rate of CRRT among patients with AKI was as high as 66.7e100%. 7e9 This medical evidence indicates that AKI is not uncommon among patients with COVID-19, particularly among those with severe disease. Therefore, for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, there should be prompt screening for AKI risk factors; routine and dynamic monitoring of urine, urine sensitive kidney function, and serum creatinine; daily assessment of AKI complications; and optimization of volume and hemodynamics. The use of nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided whenever possible, and early blood purification interventions should be performed to reduce the occurrence and progression of AKI.

When conditions permit, noninvasive ultrasound and dynamic assessment of patients with severe disease are recommended. 2. Volume management during CRRT: Patients with severe COVID-19 usually have ARDS. Under the premise of not affecting tissue perfusion, it is recommended that a negative balance be maintained as much as possible. It is recommended that goal-oriented titration with three-level volume management be used; i.e., when appropriate under hemodynamic monitoring (such as CVP, ultrasound for severe disease), calculate fluid input and output per hour.In particular, pay attention to the amount of insignificant water lost from the respiratory tracts of patients with COVID-19 in respiratory distress. 3. Monitoring of solute clearance: Serum creatinine levels should be monitored daily to ensure that the serum creatinine level on each day of CRRT is lower than that of the previous day. When the purpose is to remove inflammatory mediators, daily monitoring of the blood count, lymphocyte count, and C-reactive protein level and dynamic monitoring of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, lymphocyte subsets, and other indicators should be performed.In clinical practice, we should also pay attention to the effect of CRRT on the clearance of drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. Currently, the most commonly used anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir and)arbidol are cleared mainly through non-renal routes, and the protein binding rate is above 90%; therefore, there is no need to adjust the dose of these antiviral drugs during CRRT.7 X.-H.
