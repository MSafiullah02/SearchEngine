Based on data for 72 314 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 14% of people have severe disease, 5% have critical illness, and 2\u00b73% die.1 COVID-19 is not a conventional disease, and rapid changes in the provision of critical care have been needed to meet the needs of patients. Health emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak can be a huge challenge for critical-care physicians, who need strong comprehensive skills to respond effectively.2 Critical-care-related continuing medical education has an important part to play in preparing for and responding to such emergencies.",

In response to this public health emergency, 278 medical teams from 29 provinces in China were dispatched to Hubei province, 32 395 medical personnel in total.

A major feature of the health system in Zhejiang province is the continuous training of critical-care physicians. From 2009 to 2019, 18 940 physicians were enrolled in the Chinese Critical Care Certified Course (5C) programme, of whom 13 826 (73%) were critical-care physicians. The 5C programme covers 31 provinces in China. Courses in the 5C programme are provided by a multidisciplinary care team; multidisciplinary care is important to decrease mortality among patients in the ICU.4 The top three provinces in terms of the number of participants were Jiangsu province (1808 [9\u00b76%]), Henan province (1599 [8\u00b74%]), and Guangdong province (1428 [7\u00b75%]); Zhejiang province (1151 [6\u00b71%]) ranked fifth, whereas Hubei province had only 610 participants (3\u00b72%; table\n). The hope is that such programmes can increase professional knowledge and improve the practical skills of physicians.",
