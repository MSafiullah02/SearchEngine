Consisting of five domains, Nsp3 is the largest of these (180-210 kDa). Among these domains, the so-called X-domain is believed to act as ADP-ribose-1 00phosphate phosphatase or to bind poly(ADP-ribose). However, here we show that the X-domain of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (strain Beaudette), a Group-3 coronavirus, fails to bind ADP-ribose. This is explained on the basis of the crystal structure of the protein, determined at two different pH values. For comparison, we also describe the crystal structure of the homologous X-domain from Human Coronavirus 229E, a Group-1 coronavirus, which does bind ADP-ribose.",

Their enveloped, spherical virions have a diameter of 100-160 nm and carry prominent spike proteins that give the surface of the particle a crown-like appearance in the electron microscope, hence the name coronaviruses. The genera Torovirus and Coronavirus are members of the family Coronaviridae. This family belongs to the order Nidovirales, together with the Arterivirdae and Roniviridae families. Nidoviruses have similar genome organization and replication strategies but they differ in morphology, genome size, and several other biological properties. 1 Coronaviruses have been subdivided into three main groups based on serological and genetic properties. Group 1 includes the human coronaviruses 229E (HCoV 229E) and NL63 (HCoV NL63), the porcine Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV), and feline coronavirus (FCoV). Although a Group-3 coronavirus was recently isolated from a Beluga whale, 2 members of this subgroup generally infect birds, for example, the Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) which can cause serious economic loss in the chicken industry. 3 The human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV OC43) and HKU1 (HCoV HKU1), Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) belong to Group 2. The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a coronavirus that was classified as an outlier in Group 2, 4 renewed the interest in the coronavirus family.",

HCoV NL63 causes respiratory tract illness in children below the age of 1 year and in immunocompromised adults. 5 The coronavirus genome contains several open reading frames (ORFs). The two overlapping ORFs 1a and 1b at the 5 0 end comprise two thirds of the genome. ORF1a encodes the polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and ORF1a and 1b together code for pp1ab. Synthesis of the latter depends on a (\u00c01) ribosomal frameshift during translation, which occurs just upstream of the ORF1a stop codon. In most coronaviruses, the polyproteins are processed by two papain-like proteases (PL1 pro and PL2 pro ) and the main proteinase (M pro ), all of which are encoded within ORF1a. The resulting 15 (IBV) or 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsps) are associated with genomic and/or subgenomic RNA synthesis (replication and transcription, respectively). Some of them may also be involved in interactions with host-cell components.",

            "text": "With a molecular mass of 180-210 kDa, the multidomain Nsp3 is the largest cleavage product of pp1a and pp1ab. Its domain organization is more or less conserved among the coronaviruses. Several highly hydrophobic stretches in the C-terminal Y domain anchor Nsp3 to intracellular membranes. [11] [12] [13] Immuno-EM studies revealed that most of Nsp3 localizes to convoluted membranes, which are part of a reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that is thought to support the viral replication/transcription complexes. 14 The N-terminal domain of Nsp3 comprises 150-240 amino-acid residues and is called acidic domain in view of the high number of Asp and Glu residues in its carboxy-terminal third. The first papain-like prote-ase (PL1 pro ) is located downstream of the acidic domain. Along with the PL2 pro , which is further downstream, the PL1 pro is responsible for the processing of three (IBV: two) cleavage sites containing LXGG ; X consensus sequences in the N-terminal third of the coronaviral polyproteins. Interestingly, the PL1 pro is missing in SARS-CoV, 4 and in IBV, it is catalytically inactive because of amino-acid replacements in the catalytic center. 13 C-terminal to the PL1 pro of most coronaviruses, there is the so-called X-domain, which was first described by Gorbalenya et al. 15 and was later proposed to be an ADP-ribose-1 00 -phosphate phosphatase (Appr-1 00 -pase). 4 Appr-1 00 -pases are involved in tRNA splicing by removing the phosphate group of adenosine diphosphate ribose 1 00 -phosphate, thus producing adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADP-ribose). 16 Appr-1 00 -pase activity has been demonstrated in vitro for the isolated Xdomains of HCoV 229E 17 and SARS-CoV. 18, 19 The structure of the SARS-CoV Nsp3 X-domain (SARS-X) has been determined by Saikatendu et al., 18 and, in complex with ADP-ribose, by Egloff et al. 19 The fold of the SARS-X was found to be similar to that of the so-called macrodomain. This name goes back to the noncanonical domain in the histone mac-roH2A. 20 The macrodomain fold has also been found in X-ray structures of proteins from the thermophilic organism Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AF1521 protein; Refs. 21 and 22), yeast (Ymx7 protein; Ref. 23) , and E. coli (Er58 protein).",

During refinement of the structure, difference density for two tartrate (TLA) molecules emerged. One molecule is located at loop L10 and is hydrogenbonded to the backbone NH of Asp 117 and the sidechain of Arg 77. This tartrate is also involved in a crystal contact with Ser 47 and Gly 48 of a neighboring molecule.

            "text": "The putative ligand-binding site Coronaviral X-domains have been proposed to bind ADP-ribose, either as product of an ADP-ribose-1 00phosphate phosphatase (Appr-1 00 -pase) activity, 17 or as part of poly(ADP-ribose) binding. 19 As described earlier, we found by ZIGE and ITC that 229E-X binds ADP-ribose, but IBV-X (strain Beaudette) fails to do so. To rationalize this observation on the basis of our crystal structures, we will inspect the putative binding sites for ADP-ribose in the two proteins in detail and compare them with the crystal structure of SARS-X in complex with ADP-ribose. 19 In the latter structure, the adenine of ADP-ribose is recognized by a 2.9 \u00c5 hydrogen bond from the exocyclic NH 2 group of the base to the carboxylate of Asp 23 [ Fig. 4(A) ]. This aspartate residue is highly conserved in coronavirus X-domains, including HCoV 229E and IBV. In the structures of IBV-X and 229E-X, both of which lack a bound ADP-ribose, this aspartate is oriented away from the binding site. In SARS-X, the adenine ring of ADP-ribose is sandwiched between the side-chains of Further along the binding site for ADP-ribose in SARS-X, the cleft is lined by three consecutive glycines [nos. 47, 48, and 49 ; at the C-terminus of the b3-a2 (L5) loop] on one side and the 129 SAGIFG 134 segment on the other [ Fig. 4(A) ]. The amide of Gly 48 makes a 3.0 \u00c5 hydrogen bond to the O1 00 of the distal ribose and Phe 133 packs against this sugar on its opposite face. The backbone amide groups of Ser 129, Gly 131, Ile 132, and Phe 133 donate hydrogen bonds to the phosphate oxygens. Most importantly, the side-chain of Ile 132 is in close contact (3.5 \u00c5) with Gly 48, thereby forming a ''bridge'' over the binding cleft. 19 Even in the absence of ADP-ribose, this close interaction exists in SARS-X (4.1 \u00c5; Ref. 18 ). The ''triple glycine'' sequence is conserved in most coronavirus X-domains, with a few exceptions, including IBV (strain Beaudette, but not all IBV strains) and MHV, which have the second glycine replaced by Ser and Ala, respectively, and TGEV and FCoV, which have Met and Val, respectively, instead of the first glycine. The replacement of the ''central glycine'' by serine is correlated with dramatic structural differences between the X-domains of IBV (strain Beaudette) and SARS-CoV: as the close contact to the conserved isoleucine (no. 131 in IBV-X) is no longer possible, the bridge across the binding cleft collapses, and the entire b6-a5 (L11) loop carrying the 128 SLGIFG 133 segment is pushed away (see Fig. 4 ). As a consequence, the Ca atom of Ile 131 in the high-pH form of IBV-X is located 5.9 \u00c5 away from the position of the corresponding Ile 132 in SARS-X [ Fig. 4(A) ]. In the low-pH form, this distance is 4.4 \u00c5, but as described earlier, the b6-a5 (L11) loop is involved in a crystal contact in this structure.",

In view of the conformational changes described, it is no surprise that IBV-X (strain Beaudette) does not bind ADP-ribose to a significant extent.",

Yet, the hydrogen bonds between the main-chain amides of the 122 SCGIFG 127 and the phosphates as well as the distal ribose of ADP-ribose can all be made, as demonstrated in the structure of the highly similar X-domain of human coronavirus NL63 with ADP-ribose (Piotrowski et al., in preparation). In agreement with this, we were able to measure significant binding of ADP-ribose to 229E-X (see Fig. 1 ). 19 compared with the equivalent site in IBV-X8.5. The ADP-ribose molecule and the amino acid residues involved in the binding are represented as sticks. Carbon atoms of the ADP-ribose are colored white, carbon atoms of the protein are colored yellow and green, for SARS-X and IBV-X, respectively. Nitrogens and oxygens are colored blue and red, respectively. B: Residues 42 GGG 44 and 122 SCGIFG 127 (L11) of 229E-X (sticks, blue carbon atoms), likely involved in binding ADP-ribose, superimposed onto the corresponding site ( 46 GSG 48 and 128 SLGIFG 133 ) in IBV-X8.5 (transparent surface colored according to electrostatic potential, green sticks). Residue labels for 229E-X are framed. Note that Ile 131, and with it, the entire loop L11, in IBV-X is ''pushed away'' (red arrows) due to steric hindrance from Ser 47, thereby destroying the binding site for ADP-ribose.",

A similar cooperation was envisioned for a fraction of coronaviruses which encode a CPD homologue. 4, 31, 32 However, the turnover constant, k cat , measured for the Appr-1 00 -pase activity of isolated coronaviral X-domains, is unusually low (5-20 min \u00c01 ; Ref. 28) for an enzyme involved in metabolic regulation. Although the k cat for the full-length Nsp3 remains unknown, this observation was used to question a direct role of the coronavirus X-domain in viral RNA synthesis. 19 If the X-domain does not participate in coronavirus RNA replication, its involvement in the regulation of virus-host interaction has to be considered. Eriksson et al. 33 have shown that mice infected with mutant MHV, which carried the aforementioned Asn 41!Ala mutation (SARS-X numbering) in the X-domain, exhibited reduced cytokine production, decreased liver pathogenesis, and increased interferon-a production. We also note that other domains of Nsp3 are involved in interaction with host-cell components. The PL pro of SARS-CoV has been shown to block type-I interferon production in the host. 34 The SARS-unique domain (SUD) of SARS-CoV Nsp3 has been proposed to counteract host-cell apoptosis at the translational level by binding to oligo(G) stretches in the 3 0 UTR of the mRNA of the apoptosis-related protein Bbc3, or to interrupt type-I interferon production by binding to similar regions of mRNA coding for signaling proteins in the MAP-kinase cascade. 35 For SARS-X, Egloff et al. 19 have demonstrated poly(ADP-ribose)-binding properties, suggesting that the domain may play a role in signaling pathways involving this polymer.",

            "text": "Poly(ADP-ribosylation) is an important posttranslational modification catalyzed by the enzyme family of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). The prototype of the family, PARP-1, is involved in the recognition of DNA damage. Binding to DNA singlestrand and double-strand breaks stimulates PARP-1 to catalyze the synthesis of linear and branched polymers of ADP-ribose from the substrate nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD \u00fe ), with concomitant release of nicotinamide. 36 PARP-1 is also a major regulator of apoptosis; this is, at least in part, because of its function as a coactivator of NF-jB-dependent gene expression. 37, 38 PARPs are primarily localized in the nucleus, but certain members of the family appear to act in the cytoplasm, at least partly. 39 Several viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract the apoptotic activity of PARPs. The viral protein R (Vpr) of HIV-1 has been reported to form a ternary complex with the glucocorticoid receptor and PARP-1, thereby preventing translocation of the latter to the nucleus. 40 Poliovirus, SARS coronavirus, and Infectious Bronchitis Virus have been shown to induce proteolytic cleavage of PARP-1. [41] [42] [43] We speculate that the viral X-domains could also have an adverse affect on the activity of cytoplasmic PARPs, either by binding to the poly(ADP-ribose) chains that PARPs not only attach to target proteins but also to themselves, or by direct interaction. Such a direct interaction between the parent macrodomain, that of histone macroH2A, and nuclear PARP-1 has recently been shown to decrease the catalytic activity of the enzyme. 44, 45 Our data show that the IBV-X (strain Beaudette) fails to bind ADP-ribose. This observation is explained by the three-dimensional structure of the protein. The replacement by serine of the central glycine (Gly 47) of the triple-Gly sequence that forms part of the ADPribose binding site, pushes away the opposite Ile 131 and leads to a major conformational change of the loop (L11) carrying this residue (see Fig. 4 ), resulting in the loss of as many as five hydrogen bonds and one hydrophobic interaction with ADP-ribose. Therefore, we conclude that not all coronavirus X-domains bind ADP-ribose or poly(ADP-ribose) and suggest that either the X-domain in IBV (strain Beaudette) is a relict of evolution, or it has another function remaining to be characterized.",

            "text": "The X-domains of HCoV 229E and IBV (corresponding to pp1a/pp1ab residues 1270-1434 and 1005-1176, respectively) were predicted in Nsp3 using pan-coronavirus multiple sequence alignment generated with support from the Viralis software platform (Gorbalenya et al., unpublished) and previously characterized X-domains. [17] [18] [19] Domains were PCR-amplified from viral RNA or cDNA and cloned into the pET-M11 vector and expressed with an N-terminal extension (MKHHHHHHPMSDYDIPTTENLYFQGAMA), including a His 6 tag for purification and a TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQ ; G) for removal of the tag. The two proteins were produced and purified in similar ways. The respective plasmid was transformed into the competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain. Cultivation in 1\u00c2 TY medium was performed at 37 C. Gene expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG when cells had reached an optical density of 0.5 at 660 nm. Expression was carried out at 20 C for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 7200g and 4 C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0, for 229E-X and 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0, for IBV-X, each including 10 mg lysozyme and one Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Cells were broken by French press. After ultracentrifugation (150,000g, 1 h, 4 C) of the sample, the supernatant was applied to a His-Trap FF 5-mL column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. After washing with the buffer mentioned earlier, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 20-500 mM imidazole. For IBV-X, the buffer was changed to cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 8.0) by size exclusion on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). TEV protease and X-domain carrying an N-terminal His 6 tag were combined to a molar ratio of 1 : 40 (protease: tagged IBV-X) and the sample was incubated for 16 h at 20 C. To separate tag-free IBV-X from the His 6 tag and the TEV protease, the protein solution was applied to a His-Trap FF 5-mL column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. In case of 229E-X, the His 6 -tag-free protein tended to precipitate after incubation with the TEV protease at 20 C and even at 4 C. Therefore, purification of this X-domain was carried out without removal of the His 6 tag and the protein was applied to the Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) for size exclusion and buffer exchange (10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) directly after Ni 2\u00fe -NTA affinity chromatography. IBV-X was treated in the same way after the cleavage. For further details, see Piotrowski et al. 46 Crystallization, structure determination, and refinement Crystallization screening was performed using a Phoenix robot (Dunn Labortechnik, Thelenberg, Germany) employing the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion technique. Drops containing 0.26 lL protein solution and 0.28 lL reservoir solution were equilibrated against 85 lL reservoir solution. Initial hits were optimized the same way.",

Diffraction data for IBV-X8.5 were processed, reduced, and scaled with DENZO/SCALEPACK (HKL Suite; Ref. 47) . Data for 229E-X and IBV-X5.6 were processed with MOSFLM 48 and scaled with the programm SCALA from the CCP4 suite. 49 Structure determination and refinement. The structures were determined by molecular replacement using the CCP4 program Phaser. [50] [51] [52] For HCoV 229E, the X-domain of HCoV NL63 (Piotrowski et al., in preparation; PDB ID 2VRI) was used as a search model. In case of IBV-X5.6, molecular replacement was not straightforward and required the usage of eight superimposed coordinate sets. This ensemble included structures of similar fold as predicted by FFAS03 (Ref. 53; PDB codes: 1YD9, 1ZR3, 2DX6, 1SPV, 1ZR5, 2ACF) and previously solved structures of the X-domain from HCoV NL63 (Piotrowski et al., in preparation) and HCoV 229E (this communication). Truncation of flexible regions in the search model was crucial to obtain a clear molecular replacement solution. To improve the relatively poor overall electron density of the initial model, protein backbone conformations were remodeled, ambiguous side-chains were changed to alanine, and two helices were adjusted manually. The model was completed using ARP/ wARP. 54, 55 The structure of IBV-X8.5 was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of IBV-X5.6 as a search model. Models were built into electron density using COOT, 56 and refined by REFMAC5. 57 Structure superimposition and calculation of r.m.s. deviations were carried out using ALIGN. 58 Atomic coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID of 229E-X: 3EJG, IBV-X8.5: 3EJF, and IBV-X5.6: 3EKE).",

In contrast to the X-domain of IBV strain Beaudette, which is the subject of the present paper, residue 47 is a glycine rather than a serine in the protein of IBV strain M41. Thus, the canonical triple-glycine sequence seen in other coronavirus X-domains is conserved and ADPribose binding is not prevented, in contrast to the Xdomain of IBV strain Beaudette.
