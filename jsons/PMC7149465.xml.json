Rosevear (1974) believes that it is unthinkable that Loche would have insulted a high-ranking officer and friend by deliberately attaching a femine forename to an animal, which he hoped would commemorate this officer\u2019s support. Trouessart (1897, 1904) eventually recorded what he thought was Loche\u2019s original intention. However, the original spelling of the specific name margarita has been retained to avoid confusion because of its long and wide usage.",

The Transcaspian sand cat was named Felis thinobius by Pocock (1938a) and recognized as a separate species by Haltenorth (1953) and Weigel (1961). Heptner and Dementiev (1937) argued that these sand cats belonged to F. margarita. No other evidence of the extent of the F. margarita distribution existed beyond these 2 widely separated areas until a specimen was collected in Arabia in the 1950s (Harrison 1968). The discovery of the sand cat in southwestern Balochistan, Pakistan, filled an important gap in the known distribution of this species (Lay et al. 1970). Loche\u2019s margarita and Ognev\u2019s thinobius were restudied and reclassified as subspecies of F. margarita (Heptner 1970; Hemmer 1974b; Schauenberg 1974; Wozencraft 2005; Wilson and Mittermeier 2009).",

The ear pinnae are large, set low on the head, and inclined outward (Heptner and Sludskii 1992). Three bony features of the external and middle ear are distinguishing features. The bony ear canal is unusually prominent, the region between the bullae is unusually narrow because of the increased bullar width, and the anterior extreme of the bullae is further anterior than the glenoid fossa, a consequence of the long length of the bullae (Schauenberg 1974; Heptner and Sludskii 1992; Huang et al. 2002). Huang et al.

Births are reported from January to April in the Sahara (Dragesco-Joff\u00e9 1993). Young F. margarita have been found in March and April and a 6-week-old litter was found in October in Balochistan, Pakistan (Roberts 1997). F. margarita litters from this area typically have either 2 or 3 young. In Turkmenistan, births occur during April and nursing-young have been taken from burrows in late April and May (Heptner and Sludskii 1992). In many areas where F. margarita occurs, the best vegetation growth is in March and April, and many rodents breed during this time providing an abundant food resource (Roberts 1997).

No ecological explanation for the gaps in F. margarita distribution has been proposed despite seemly appropriate habitat (Nowell and Jackson 1996). This species is often characterized as rare (Nowell and Jackson 1996; Sunquist and Sunquist 2002; Sliwa 2013). Additional fine-scale distribution studies, estimates of home range size, and determinations of population density across the range of this species are needed. F. margarita populations are likely declining due to degradation of their desert habitat and related declines in prey abundance, but accurate information is lacking (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002; Wilson and Mittermeier 2009; Mallon et al. 2011).",

Although more information is needed to confirm the population trend across the region, populations of F. margarita in the Arabian Peninsula are probably declining because their sand dune habitat continues to be lost (Abahussain et al. 2002; Al-Sharhan et al. 2003; Mallon and Budd 2011).",

An 8-year study in this area yielded 3 years with a higher density (2\u20133 cats per 100 km of survey route) and 5 years with lower density (1 per 100 km of survey route\u2014Belousova 1993). The distribution of F. margarita appears to be declining in areas where human activity has negatively impacted its habitat and prey base (Heptner and Sludskii 1992; Wilson and Mittermeier 2009). The introduction of feral and domestic dogs and cats is another serious problem because of increasing competition, predation, and the potential for disease transmission. Snow cover in central Asia hampers hunting by F. margarita. For example, the severe winter conditions of 1953\u20131954 in the southern one-half of the Kyzylkum Desert with snow cover lasting for 3 months led to high F. margarita mortality. Following that winter, the number of F. margarita caught by fur traders declined 2\u201310 times. The population of F. margarita in the Chagai Desert of Baluchistan, Pakistan, was devastated by commercial collectors within a decade after their presence was discovered in the mid-1960s (Hemmer 1977; Roberts 1997). Although Nowell and Jackson (1996) indicated F. margarita still occurred widely in this area, this species is now considered endangered in Pakistan (Mallon et al. 2011).",

Its small-mammal prey often live clustered around vegetation and generally do not extend onto bare sand, especially during drought years.",

In the United Arab Emirates, F. margarita inhabits areas where inter-dune gravel flats are bordered by sparsely vegetated sand dunes. Haloxylon salicornicum shrubs and Pennisetum divisum grass dominate the gravel flats (Cunningham 2002). In central Asia, F. margarita is typically found in desert areas among the sparsely vegetated ridges and sandy hills where various species of Meriones (jirds) are common (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). F. margarita rarely occurs in areas of shifting sand where vegetation is lacking (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). However, F. margarita appears abundant deep inside extensive sandy massifs where sand desert conditions are well developed and where compacted soils are absent or cover only a small area (Heptner and Sludskii 1992). This cat is rare in the sand and clayey plains of Ustyurt and in the Mangyshlak regions of Kazakhstan but is common in the southern Kyzylkum Desert.",

These cats are capable of rapid digging to capture burrow-dwelling rodents (Schauenberg 1974). F. margarita has also been observed leaving its den to feed on swarming locusts (Khan 1998). F. margarita is not known to scavenge but will cover large kills with sand and return later to feed (Dragesco-Joff\u00e9 1993). Most of the water in its diet is derived from its food. However, F. margarita will drink, if water is readily available. Unfortunately, the food habits of F. margarita are difficult to study because it covers its scats with sand obscuring the location (Hemmer 1977; Abbadi 1993). Like other felids, F. margarita is capable of eating large amounts of food when the food is available, but under normal circumstances probably consumes about 10% of its own body weight per day (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).",

F. margarita is found in the Eastern Desert of Egypt living in association with the golden jackal, R\u00fcppell\u2019s fox (Vulpes rueppelli), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), and F. chaus (Goodman and Helmy 1986). R\u00fcppell\u2019s fox also co-occurs with F. margarita in the Mahazat As-Sayd Protected Area in Saudi Arabia (Strauss et al. 2007). In this area, the density of R\u00fcppell\u2019s fox is 5 times greater than F. margarita, and both species rely heavily on small rodents for food. The larger R\u00fcppell\u2019s fox density may result in interspecific competition for rodent prey that limits the abundance of F. margarita populations. F. margarita may be found living sympatrically with other carnivores, including F. silvestris and red fox in Israel (Abbadi 1993), red fox, Corsac fox (V. corsac), and less commonly F. silvestris in Turkmenistan (Heptner and Sludskii 1992). F. margarita also appears sensitive to human disturbance and habitat encroachment.",

Following the discovery and export of F. m. scheffeli from Pakistan in the late 1960s, the interest in its captive breeding increased significantly. The 1st individuals bred in captivity were primarily F. m. scheffeli (Witzenberger and Hochkirch 2013). Beginning in the late 1980s, the captive F. margarita population has grown rapidly; the international F. margarita studbook as of 31 January 2013 lists 174 cats in captivity at 44 facilities (Breton 2013). The European captive population is comprised only of F. m. harrisoni. The North American captive population consists of F. m. harrisoni and F. m. harrisoni \u00d7 F. m. scheffeli hybrids (Breton 2013). F. margarita is 1 of 5 small cat species given priority for conservation in North American zoos (Herrick et al. 2005). However, it is likely that periodic introductions of genetic variability, longer generation intervals, and increases in population size will be required to maximize the long-term survival prospects for this species (Mallon et al. 2011).",

Captive F. margarita also died from enteritis, chronic bronchitis, liver degeneration, and myocarditis (Sausman 1997b). In recent years, the widespread use of domestic cat vaccines has proven to be an effective treatment for respiratory infections.

The typical copulatory sequence begins with the male approaching the female (Mellen 1993). The male grasps the female by the nape and mounts using the forelegs followed by hind legs. The female responds to the nape biting by adopting a lordosis posture and moving her tail to one side. The male follows with intromission and pelvic thrusting. Mounts resulting in intromission are followed by a copulatory cry (barely audible growl) by the female. The female then throws the male off and begins rolling on her back (typically lasting 5\u201330 s).

The frequency spectrum for F. margarita intense mew calls is mainly restricted to below 2kHz, the range to which their ear is adapted (Huang et al. 2002). Peters et al.

Chan (2005) reported that F. margarita has lower mean acoustic thresholds (by 6\u20139 dB) between 0.25 and 5kHz than other felid species that have been studied, supporting the hypothesis that F. margarita hearing is unusually sensitive.",

Their claws are not very sharp due to the lack of places to sharpen them (Dragesco-Joff\u00e9 1993). F. margarita does not rely on a specific den. Dens are shared by different individuals, but not at the same time (Abbadi 1989, 1991, 1993). However, F. margarita pairs may share the same burrows during the breeding season (Schauenberg 1974). Once a burrow is selected, F. margarita typically does not change burrows during the day. F. margarita utilizes burrows that it digs itself, burrows abandoned by other animals (e.g., red fox, Corsac fox, R\u00fcppell\u2019s fox, or porcupine\u2014Erethizon dorsatum), or it may enlarge a gerbil or ground squirrel burrow (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). F. margarita usually burrows into the compact soil at the base of a small mound, beneath a shrub, or away from vegetation on a flat sand surface (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). F. margarita may prefer to burrow in areas with rodent burrows, but tracks indicate that it regularly hunts over shifting sand dunes (Roberts 1997). One den in the northern Kyzylkum Desert was constructed by enlarging a gerbil burrow and was home to a female F. margarita, her 3 young, and 5 great gerbils (Heptner and Sludskii 1992). F. m. thinobia lives in shallow burrows in sand constructed among the roots of saltbushes or Calligonum plants. F. m. margarita may use fennec (Vulpes zerda) burrows, an ecologically similar species.",

Near Repetek, 2 burrows were dug among white saxauls, each with a single entry and 2.5\u20133.0 m long (Sapozhenkov 1961). A burrow in Niger was 15cm in diameter and 1.5 m long (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002); it was dug in a straight line that sloped down to a point about 60cm below the surface (Dragesco-Joff\u00e9 1993). A burrow excavated in Nushki, Pakistan, was 14cm wide and 4.6 m long (Roberts 1997). F. margarita in the United Arab Emirates may occasionally utilize shaded areas above ground rather than burrows (Cunningham 2002).",

Heptner and Sludskii (1992) also report that this species was caught in the hundreds in Kazakhstan. Populations of F. m. scheffeli in Pakistan apparently declined because of exploitation by commercial animal dealers from 1967 to 1972 (Nowell and Jackson 1996). A number of these animals were also captured and sent to private collectors and zoos in Europe and North America, leading to an expanded representation in zoos and an increase in captive breeding (Roberts 1997).",
