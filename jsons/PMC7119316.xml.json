Among air pollutants, particulate matter (PM) has been found to be the most damaging to human health (USAEPA, 1997, USAEPA, 1999). Many epidemiological studies in the past 20 years have revealed that the PM pollution, especially the fine particles (PM2.5, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm) are associated with higher rates of mortality and morbidity under long- or short-term exposure (Morgan et al., 2003, Pope et al., 1995a, Pope et al., 1995b, Pope et al., 2002, Pope et al., 2004, Schwartz et al., 1996, Xu et al., 1995a, Xu et al., 1995b).",

According to the World Bank, 16 of the world's 20 most polluted cities are in China (Economist, 2004). Urban air pollution has become a barrier to sustainable development. Beijing, as a megacity (with a population of \u2265 10 million; Gurjar and Lelieveld, 2005) and the capital of China, has a very serious air pollution problem. The concentration of particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 \u03bcm (PM10) monitored by the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB) from 2000 to 2004 indicated that particulate matter was a major problem in Beijing (BJEPB, 2000\u20132004). During these years, the annual PM10 concentrations ranged between 141 and 166 \u03bcg m\u2212 3 and were nearly three times the Grade 1 national standard, i.e., 50 \u03bcg m\u2212 3. Epidemiological research using time series methods has shown the relationship between ambient PM concentrations and human health in Beijing (Dong et al., 1995, Chang et al., 2003a, Chang et al., 2003b) and has quantified the daily mortality and morbidity relative to PM concentrations. With the 2008 Olympic Games approaching, the air quality in Beijing must be improved to project a positive image of the city to the world.",

            "text": "Monitoring stations often measure several air pollutants, e.g. PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3. The variation in ambient concentrations of these pollutants may be dominated by atmospheric diffusion, so that levels of the different pollutants are correlated. To avoid over-estimating health effects, K\u00fcnzli et al. (2000) derived estimates from a single indicator pollutant. Although fine particle (PM2.5) pollution has a stronger association with adverse human health effects, it has not been measured in China. Researchers (Quah and Boon, 2003, Kan and Chen, 2004) therefore used PM10 as an indicator. The annual PM10 concentrations for 2000\u20132004 in Beijing were reported in the BJEPB annual reports (Table 1\n), the data were averaged over seven urban substations. Consequently, the domain of the health effects being studied in the present study is the urban areas of Beijing. The high annual concentrations could have originated from several emission sources. The population of Beijing, both total and urban, continues to increase (Table 1; BMBS, 2005). Coal remains a major energy source in Beijing; in 2003 nearly 27 million tons of coal provided more than 50% of the total energy consumption (BJEPB, 2003). The Capital Steel Corporation, located west of urban Beijing, has the capacity to produce 6 million tons of steel each year. Sand storms frequently affect Beijing in the spring. Road dust is resuspended by shearing force as well as by the turbulent wakes of vehicles (Song et al., 2006).",

The Cox's proportional hazard model was often selected to determine the effect of air pollution on morbidity and mortality rates after adjusting for other factors such as cigarette smoking, education level, body mass index, occupational exposure to dust or fumes, as well as age and sex of the subjects. However, some study showed the increase of adverse health effects in the lower range of air pollution was rapid than that in the higher range of air pollution (e.g., Xu et al., 1995a). They were at variance with exponential exposure\u2013response function. Thus, the linear function is selected in this study. The adverse health efforts of air pollution were calculated as:(1)\u0394\u2061E=E\u2212E0=E0\u03b2(C\u2212C0)where \u03b2 is the exposure\u2013response coefficient, C and C\n0 are the ambient and threshold pollutant concentrations and E and E\n0 are the health effects at C and C\n0, respectively.

Aunan and Pan (2004) provided exposure\u2013response coefficients for China according to a meta-analysis, based on the review of the exposure\u2013response function for health effects and PM pollution. The results were very close to those used in Kan and Chen (2004), as both cited literatures were almost same. For long-time mortality, we acknowledge that the cohort studies were absent in China and the PM pollution level is much higher than that in Western countries. The meta-analysis results from short-time studies in Asia (almost from China and Korea) for PM10 pollution on all-case mortality were similar with the studies in American and Europe (see Table 20 in HEI, 2004). The relative risks could be transferred. Aunan and Pan (2004) also suggested that the estimates from US cohort studies may be used in China and the results be likely to be on the high side. Therefore, the results for long-time mortality from cohort studies from Dockery et al. (1993) and Pope et al. (1995b) were used in this study.",

It represents an individual's willingness to pay (WTP) for a marginal reduction in the risk of dying. For the valuation of reduced morbidity, besides WTP, the cost of illness (COI) approach could also be used. COI measures the total cost of illness that is imposed on a society (Quah and Boon, 2003). Because a survey of the economic cost of mortality and morbidity from air pollution was not available for China, the benefit transfer approach (BTA) was required. It uses the values of environmental loss of a project to estimate the values of a similar project, assuming that the latter project will have a similar impact (Quah and Boon, 2003, Kan and Chen, 2004).",

The adjustment considered the difference between the annual income in Chongqing and Beijing, while the estimation of VOSL in Beijing was transferred on the marginal WTP and income.

We should also point out that the results in this study could probably be overestimated on some other important reasons.

The emissions from combustion sources, such as coal burning and oil burning, and the secondary products from photochemical reactions contributed mostly in PM2.5 in Beijing (Song et al., 2006). Coal is still a dominant energy source in Beijing, especially in industry for electricity generation (EGU). It could be an effective way to use the advanced coal gasification technologies in the coal-fired EGU. Raw coal used in industrial plants could be replaced by cleaner energy sources, such as natural gas or electric power. A remarkable problem is that the number of motor vehicles is increasing rapid from 1.5 million in 2000 to 2.4 million in 2004. Conversely, the bicycle use is declining. Beijing government should preserve or restore bicycle lanes and provide free parking facilities to encourage the bicycle use. On the other hand, both the control technologies on tailpipe emission and gasoline quality should be improved in motor vehicles. Reduction of gaseous pollutants, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides from tailpipe exhaust and sulfur dioxide from coal burning could alleviate the fine particles pollution transferred through photochemical reactions. As some toxic organics, such as black carbon could be still abundant in the fine part of road dust in Beijing (Song et al., 2006), the bare soil surfaces should be grassed or wooded.",
