Cytomegalovirus has the largest genome (\u223c230 kbp) of human herpesviruses, coding for more than 70 viral proteins. Herpesvirus virions acquire the envelope during the egress through the nuclear membrane. The Herpesviridae family is divided into the alpha subfamily (herpes simplex virus\u20101, herpes simplex virus\u20102 and varicella\u2010zoster virus), the beta subfamily (human cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus\u20106 and human herpesvirus\u20107) and the gamma subfamily (Epstein\u2013Barr virus and human herpesvirus\u20108). Each herpesvirus subfamily maintains latent infection in specific cell population(s). Alpha herpesviruses exhibit a relatively short reproductive cycle, rapid lysis of infected cells and latency in sensory neural ganglia. Beta herpesviruses demonstrate a long reproductive cycle, slowly progressing infection and tropism for a large range of cells. Gamma herpesviruses are usually specific for B\u2010lymphocytes, and viral latency is typically found in lymphoid tissue (2, 5, 59, 67, 68, 87, 106, 115, 142, 146).",

Herpesvirus primary infection is followed by periods of latency and reactivation. In latency, the virus resides inside the cell without being identified by the immune system and can persist as a noninfectious form for considerable periods of time and even for a lifetime. Although the mechanisms of latency may be specific for a given virus, some general strategies include infection of nonpermissive cells, restriction of cytolytic effect, blocking of apoptosis and development of viral variants. Herpes simplex virus persistence in neuronal cells is genetically mediated by latency\u2010associated transcripts, which block the expression of lytic genes and prevent apoptosis (84). Cytomegalovirus latency involves a cellular intrinsic immunity mediated by nuclear body proteins that suppress the expression of viral immediate\u2010early proteins and subsequently the lytic infection (20, 57, 137, 154).",

The common form for cytomegalovirus transmission is through biological fluids, but transplacental (\u2018congenital\u2019) transmission can take place from a mother experiencing a primary infection that is not controlled by neutralizing antibodies (26, 52, 88, 178, 183).

A selective depletion of CD4+ T\u2010cells increases the incidence of recurrent murine cytomegalovirus infection in mice (117). Also, CD4+ T\u2010cells contribute to the control of primary murine cytomegalovirus infection in mice depleted of CD8+ T\u2010cells (76). Deficiency in cytomegalovirus\u2010specific CD4+ T\u2010cell immunity has been linked to a prolonged urinary and salivary shedding of cytomegalovirus in otherwise healthy children (111). Similarly to the CD8+ cytomegalovirus\u2010specific T\u2010cell compartment, a high proportion of CD4+ T\u2010cells in healthy seropositive individuals are committed to anti\u2010cytomegalovirus immunity (46). The specificity of the cytomegalovirus\u2010specific CD4+ T\u2010cell response exhibits broad antigen recognition, with glycoprotein B\u2010specific CD4+ T\u2010cell responses predominating in healthy individuals (>30%), although UL14 and UL16 specific responses are prominent in a small number (<5%) of individuals (156).",

Herpesviruses establish a lifelong latent infection by subverting the host\u2019s innate and adaptive immune defenses and the intrinsic antiviral defense mechanisms (172). Cytomegalovirus suppresses the antiviral function of the cellular proteins involved in the intrinsic antiviral defense by elaborating viral regulatory proteins that either disrupt the subnuclear structure or induce a proteasomal degradation of the intrinsic antiviral proteins (158). It is of pathogenetic importance that viral proteins produced during replication can subvert critical functions of the host cell, such as modulation of the cell cycle and cellular gene expression, down\u2010regulation of class I major histocompatibility complex and inhibition of apoptosis (32, 46, 114, 139, 185).",

However, the cytomegalovirus phosphoprotein pp65, which has kinase activity capable of phosphorylating and selectively blocking the processing and presentation of immediate\u2010early\u2010derived antigenic peptides (57), can prevent the cytotoxic T\u2010lymphocyte response (58). Also, the cytomegalovirus genome encodes five proteins \u2013 US2, US3, US6, US10 and US11 \u2013 that block the formation and/or export of class I major histocompatibility complex\u2013peptide complexes and induce a rapid down\u2010regulation of class I major histocompatibility complex expression (3, 74, 75). Cytomegalovirus can also interfere with antigen presentation through the class II major histocompatibility complex pathway by means of US2, which can target the class II major histocompatibility complex molecules for proteasome degradation (163), and by proteins that hinder the interferon\u2010\u03b3\u2010induced expression of class II major histocompatibility complex molecules (100).",

As depicted in Fig. 3, the herpesviral\u2013bacterial interactive model for destructive periodontal disease starts with dental\u2010plaque bacteria inducing inflammation of gingiva. The first cells to respond to the bacterial challenge are sulcular and junctional epithelial cells, which release defensins and cytokines, notably interleukin\u20108 and interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (6, 8, 50). The gingival connective tissue reacts by recruiting monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils (50, 81, 170), followed by CD4 cells in a T helper\u20101 and T helper\u20102 combined response (14, 181). The cytomegalovirus latent genome is carried into the periodontium by infected macrophages and T\u2010cells (42), and cytomegalovirus activation may subsequently give rise to infection of additional cell types. An active cytomegalovirus infection in macrophages and T\u2010cells triggers a significant release of interleukin\u20101\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (40, 72, 80, 94, 119, 121). These proinflammatory mediators recruit antiviral inflammatory cells to the site of infection but also induce osteoclast differentiation and the release of matrix metalloproteinases (109). Cytomegalovirus activation takes place with decreased cellular immunity and the activation process itself can further reduce the host immunity. Macrophages infected with cytomegalovirus or Epstein\u2013Barr virus exhibit a decreased host response, with inhibition of phagocytic activity, tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 production and toll\u2010like receptor\u20109 expression (90). If the duration of diminished immunity is sufficiently long, an upgrowth of specific periodontopathic bacteria and destructive periodontal disease may ensue (1, 150). Cytomegalovirus can replicate in cultured gingival tissue (65) and enhance the adherence of A. actinomycetemcomitans to such cells (160), thereby providing an additional mechanism for increasing the pathogen load.",
