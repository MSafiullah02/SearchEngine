It is now spreading via human-to-human transmission with an average basic reproductive rate (R 0 ) of 2.2. In other words, for each patient, 2.2 other individuals become infected (4) . For comparison, the R 0 for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was estimated at 3.0 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was less than 1.0. Based on the epidemiological data from Wuhan, there are several notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS and MERS: i) case fatality rates are lower; ii) asymptomatic spread can occur and iii) fever is more frequently absent (5) . Gastrointestinal complaints are uncommon among COVID-19 patients but loss of smell and loss of taste have been increasingly reported as early signs of infection. Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is a severe complication, and typical computed tomography (CT) features include ground-glass and consolidative opacities in the periphery (6) . However, it must be borne in mind that SARI can also be a manifestation of respiratory illnesses with other infectious or non-infectious causes, which need to be ruled out before attributing the presence of SARI to COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 303, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 688, "end": 691, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1037, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "As of 26 March 2020, 171 countries have been affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 or known as COVID-19 pandemic with 467,866 infected patients and 20,845 deaths, representing a 4.5% mortality rate (1) . While, at the time of writing, China is the most affected country, the rate of infection in China has slowed down significantly; however, this is not the case in Italy or the United States, which are the second and third most affected countries, respectively. Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, including Malaysia, have not been spared from COVID-19, although there have been fluctuations in the rate of infection demonstrated in the number of new cases and deaths reported in March 2020 (Table 1) (2). Barely three months after the first reported case, many countries have ordered lockdowns, including Malaysia. The Malaysian government announced an initial movement restriction order on 16 March 2020 and an extension to mid-April. These measure have been enacted for good reason. The trend in new cases does not appear to have peaked yet for Malaysia or other ASEAN countries ( Figure 1 ) (3), although there have been fluctuations in the death rates ( Figure 2 ) (1) perhaps due to different critical care capacities and resources in these countries. indicates an exponential growth in cumulative cases for three countries-Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore-which was steeper between mid-January and mid-February and then reduced until early March.

Nucleic acid amplification tests, such as realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), provide the earliest and most accurate diagnosis, but they are costly and time consuming (7) . Point-of-care tests, e.g. lateral flow assays for the detection of antibodies are more ideal in the field; however, these tests are of limited value due accuracy issues and the time required to obtain a diagnosis. Rapid antigen detection tests are still undergoing evaluation, and their efficacy is yet to be proven. Figure 3 illustrates various tests being evaluated for COVID-19 and their diagnostic coverage from the acute phase to the convalescent phase. (9). Meanwhile, grey areas and dilemmas exist without clear consensus, including guidelines for cancer patients on chemotherapy or those needing early surgical treatments. Furthermore, other issues should be addressed by hospitals through a management protocol or algorithm in place for frontline workers (10) . For example, although many resources are being diverted to the frontlines and critical care, they will be inadequate during the height of the pandemic. Thus, there is an ethical but pragmatic challenge in the allocation of critical resources, such as intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators (11) .

Proper transport and handling of specimens is necessary to ensure the integrity of the viral RNA and, hence, the accuracy of the diagnostic test. Adherence to biosafety practices is essential, and any testing should be performed in appropriately equipped laboratories by staff trained in the relevant technical and safety procedures (World Health Organization, 2020) (8). Non-propagative diagnostic laboratory work should be conducted at a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) facility, whereas propagative work, including virus culture and isolation, should be conducted at a containment laboratory with inward directional airflow (BSL-3).
