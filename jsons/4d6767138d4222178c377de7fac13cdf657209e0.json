Medicaid and private insurers have similarly increased coverage of telehealth visits. 2 We would like to highlight implications of the authors' Commentary on a less-discussed but important topic: telehealth expansion during this outbreak presents a unique opportunity to increase access to dermatologic care for underserved populations. Skin cancer mortality and certain disease morbidities are higher among ethnic minorities, the uninsured, and those with lower incomes and less education. 3 These health disparities are partially due to dermatologist maldistribution: 88% of rural counties do not have a single dermatologist, and minority communities -African-American, Latin-American, and Native-American -often have markedly fewer dermatologists. 4 Additionally, 77% of primary care providers (PCPs) for urban, lowincome communities report their patients have difficulty obtaining dermatology appointments, and while only 9% of surveyed PCPs have used teledermatology, 88% were interested in the tool. 5 Underserved populations are particularly vulnerable during this outbreak as many free and student-run safety-net clinics have closed.",

A primary barrier is infrastructural: some patients may lack appropriate technology or broadband services to access virtual platforms needed for live, synchronous teledermatology. Asking patients to send photographs in advance of telephone consultationsyielding a form of asynchronous teledermatology -may mitigate this barrier; currently, some telephone evaluations can be billed to CMS as virtual visits. 1 Another challenge is that some -particularly elderly -patients may find telehealth platforms difficult to navigate. Providing patients with step-by-step instructions for remote visits and phone numbers for technical assistance can mitigate this obstacle. Using HIPAA noncompliant technologies such as FaceTime and Skype, with which patients may have baseline familiarity, are also allowed under this waiver.",
