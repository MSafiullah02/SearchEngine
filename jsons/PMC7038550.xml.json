The incidence of LCOS in the surgical treatment of congenital heart disease (CHD) has been reported to be 25\u201360% [1], associated with a significant risk of mortality among patients [2, 3]. LCOS is associated with a decreased ejection fraction and decreased oxygen supply, which may cause hypoxia. The patients are often at a high risk of mortality and require more intensive care such as extended stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilatory support.",

The most commonly reported clinical predictors of LCOS include left ventricular ejection fraction < 20%, surgical history, female gender, and increasing age [2, 6, 7]. Prediction models based on clinical data, such as EuroSCORE, have been proposed [8].

In a secondary retrospective analysis of a prospective randomized trial, LCOS occurred in 32 of 76 (42%) neonates (median age, 7 days) after cardiac surgery [17]. This difference was attributed to the probable difference in age. Neonatal myocardium is physiologically immature [18\u201321] and every procedure affects the incidence of LCOS differently [22]. The age range of children included in this study was larger (1\u20136457 days), and we included different types of cardiac surgery.

During routine hypothermic CPB, the heart is damaged by hypothermia, ischemia-reperfusion, or hyperkalemia, which is associated with an excess risk of postoperative LCOS and severe arrhythmia [24]. Yau et al. found that during hypothermic CPB, the myocardium acquires energy through anaerobic metabolism, leading to the accumulation of lactic acid. After reperfusion, aerobic metabolism cannot be resumed immediately in cardiomyocytes owing to low temperature, but still anaerobic metabolism can occur for a short period. Whereas, patients with mild hypothermia CPB are less affected [25]. The study found that the inflammatory response mediated by CPB caused pulmonary vascular endothelial damage, which changed the pulmonary vascular reactivity. These cause excessive thromboxane production and reduced endogenous nitric oxide production, which can lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction and formation of pulmonary microthrombus. Further, these changes could induce pulmonary vascular resistance, which increases after CPB [26]. Then, the right ventricular afterload increases, which is significantly associated with right ventricular dysfunction and LCOS.",
