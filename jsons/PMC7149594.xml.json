Rabbits with congestive heart failure often have tachycardia, tachypnea, and labored breathing. Pulses may be irregular or weak. Auscultating the thorax systematically is the most important part of the cardiac examination. It is important to listen over the entire thorax to localize heart murmurs and detect arrhythmias and lung sound abnormalities. A pediatric stethoscope allows better localization of heart sounds in rabbits and is preferred for cardiac auscultation; a larger-diaphragm stethoscope enhances auscultation of the lungs. Auscultatory findings vary among rabbits with congestive heart failure, and these findings are not pathognomonic. The examiner may hear muffled heart and lung sounds with pleural effusion and increased bronchial sounds or crackles with pulmonary edema.",

Two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography assess cardiac structure, chamber size, wall thickness, and motion, as well as extracardiac structures, masses, and pleural effusion. Color-flow and spectral Doppler echocardiography assess direction and velocity of blood flow, further defining cardiac conditions.

Drug dosages for rabbits are not available for all cardiac medications, but drugs and dosages published for cats or ferrets may be successfully used on a milligram per kilogram basis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as enalapril maleate (0.25-0.5 mg/kg PO q24-48h, begin q24h) may be beneficial in treating rabbits with congestive heart failure. Digoxin (0.005-0.01 mg/kg PO q24-48h) may benefit rabbits with mitral and bicuspid regurgitation, dilated cardiomyopathy, or supraventricular arrhythmia. If digoxin is used, monitor serum digoxin levels.

In another report, three domestic rabbits were diagnosed with cutaneous lymphoma.46 Two rabbits were young (7 months and 1 year) and the third was 9 years. One young rabbit had erythematous alopecia and hemorrhagic crusts of the chin and ventral neck. At necropsy, neoplastic lymphocytes were found in the skin, lymph nodes, and lungs. In skin sections, the lymphocytes infiltrated the entire dermis and into the epidermis. The second rabbit had bilateral blepharitis that was unresponsive to treatment. At necropsy, superficial and deep lymph nodes were markedly enlarged, and lungs had reddened areas. Lymphocytic infiltrates were found in the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart. In the skin sections, lymphoid infiltrates were primarily in the subcutis and deep dermis. The third rabbit had nonpruritic alopecia of the left lateral thorax. Cutaneous lymphoma was diagnosed by biopsy of a skin sample; in this rabbit, lymphocytes infiltrated the superficial dermis and epidermis. The rabbit lived for an additional year after diagnosis, with no response to treatment with interferon alpha-2b (see Treatment below). A necropsy was not performed. In all three rabbits, immunologic staining of tissue sections confirmed the lymphoma to be of T-cell origin.",

After 1 month, the tumor had not changed in size. The rabbit was euthanatized 5 months later because of labored breathing and poor clinical condition.

In one study, rabbits that were experimentally infected with spores of E. cuniculi were treated with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg first dose, then 15 mg/kg weekly for a 12-week period). In these rabbits, clinical signs of encephalitozoonosis developed between weeks 4 and 6, and all rabbits died during week 6. No signs of infection were seen in control rabbits. These results indicate that immunosuppression induced by cyclophosphamide gave rise to lethal encephalitozoonosis. Most likely, the rabbit we treated with prednisone and radiation therapy also developed encephalitozoonosis because of immunosuppression. Other side effects can include severe anemia, enteritis, typhlitis, and nephrotoxicity. In an experimental study of rabbits given daunorubicin or doxorubicin at 3 mg/kg weekly for 10 weeks, cardiotoxicity was documented with daunorubicin but not with doxorubicin.20 Both drugs produced hemotoxicosis manifested by aplastic anemia. Rabbits treated with doxorubicin exhibited more weight loss and had higher mortality rates than those treated with daunorubicin. A single dose of l-asparaginase at 10,000 IU/kg when given intravenously can induce a hyperinsulinemic, insulin-resistant, diabetic syndrome in rabbits.22 However, in small animals l-asparaginase is currently given intramuscularly or subcutaneously; therefore route of administration may factor in toxicity. The neurotoxic effects of vincristine have been well studied in rabbits.11, 29, 30\n",
