Especially in these areas, instructions must be not only definitive and imperative, but also easily identifiable by various professionals as to their own particular responsibility areas.

These criteria are considered important for the professionals who have to implement the measures, because they reduce uncertainty about what is expected, and they also could be helpful to external assessors who evaluate crisis control.

Timely, solid guidance for health care professionals on ways to minimize their own risk by wearing PPE and complying with safety instructions will increase not only their protection, but also their confidence and motivation.21, 22 Apart from motivation, beliefs, and attitudes, adherence to individual protective measures also depends on organizational factors.16, 23, 24 According to Gershon et al,24 a safety climate characterized by a strong organizational commitment to safety leads to increased compliance with the use of PPE.

They are generic, in that they affect all 4 professions that we studied. However, we also found that different groups of professionals have different expectations and experience different problems with respect to the crisis guidelines. These depend on the context in which they work and the degree to which control measures interfere with daily routines, increase workloads, and require new skills and equipment. Our study confirms earlier results reported by Grol et al25 indicating that general practitioners's adherence decreases when guidelines demand changes to existing routines and when they lack pertinent advice on actions and decisions. Outbreak committees that issue the guidelines must be aware of these factors so they can tailor instructions to the specific needs and problems of the diverse professional groups involved.",

They also urged increased availability of organizational facilities for outbreak control, such as the capacity for cohorting and isolating patients. Our results are consistent with findings of recent studies of preparedness in hospital emergency departments. In a survey conducted by Rebmann et al,26 15% of IPs reported that their hospital had insufficient isolation facilities (eg, negative-pressure rooms) for routine needs. Even when facilities were sufficient, only 47% of the hospitals were equipped to accommodate an isolation surge.",

Moreover, the PHPs and PHNs need ways to monitor and encourage the compliance of these physicians with the crisis measures. Another commonly reported barrier was the need to define responsibilities between public health professionals and hospital professionals with respect to sampling patients and performing infection prevention and control measures. In the social context, implementing crisis guidelines and improving outcomes of measures require a clear chain of command, with control and endorsement by local policy makers.",

We first explored barriers to adherence through in-depth interviews, then assessed the frequency of these barriers in the cross-sectional study to generate priorities for future strategies. In contrast, Barlow et al9 began with the cross-sectional part and followed with in-depth interviews. However, they studied adherence to guidelines in routine care situations and had access to previous publications when constructing their framework of barriers. Given that no systematic research has been published on barriers in times of crisis, we needed in-depth interviews to explore these barriers and build the baseline framework. This qualitative approach enabled optimal exploration of hidden reasons for nonadherence. We were able to describe patterns of barriers that influence adherence, together with more individual specific constraints. Because the reported barriers might be different from those observed during outbreaks, they should be regarded as a proxy for reality. Nevertheless, they provide a basis for formulating priorities to improve adherence to guidelines in crises. We believe that our results are applicable to other industrialized countries with similar health care organization and professions as The Netherlands.",

This is the first study to systematically assess the barriers that can obstruct adherence to crisis guidelines from the standpoint of the individual health care professional. To improve adherence of these professionals in outbreak crises, priority should be given to the 4 generic barriers that we have described, irrespective of the infectious agent involved. Furthermore, for each group, profession-specific barriers need to be addressed through specific implementation strategies regarding improvement of knowledge, changing of attitudes, ensuring organizational facilities (eg, sufficient capacity for single room isolation, surge cohorting capacity, and surge laboratory capacity), and providing an adequate setting for performing crisis management.",
