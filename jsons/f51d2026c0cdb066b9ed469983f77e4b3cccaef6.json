            "text": "In human physiology, peptides are degraded by a limited number of non-specific extracellular enzymes known as peptidases or proteases. These are membrane proteins, the active sites of which face the extracellular space. Endopeptidases cut within the peptide chain, while exopeptidases release C-or N-terminal amino acids. Angiotensin-converting enzymes are exopeptidases (carboxypeptidases), relatively specific to the amino acids surrounding the cut site, although these may be common to several peptides. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme (carboxypeptidase) mainly located in the membrane cell, circulating forms remaining largely underrepresented; ACE2 is homologous to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (formerly simply known as ACE but now better denoted ACE1) first described in 2000 [3, 4] . ACE2 acts as a deactivator of angiotensin II (also known as angiotensin- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) , an active peptide causing vasoconstriction, pro-fibrosis, pro-inflammation action, stimulating aldosterone secretion by binding to the AT1 receptor), converting it into angiotensin-(1-7), an active peptide with opposite properties to angiotensin II [5] . Several in vitro studies showed that angiotensin-(1-7), by binding to the Mas receptor, induced vasodilatation and showed anti-fibrosis and anti-inflammatory properties ( Fig. 1 ) [6] .",

ACE2 also converts angiotensin 1 (also known as angiotensin-(1-10)) into angiotensin-(1-9), of unknown action, which is further converted into angiotensin-(1-7) by ACE1. The RAAS includes both an \"activator\" system including the classical and historical angiotensin II/ACE1/AT1R/aldosterone pathway, and an \"inhibitor\" system including the angiotensin-(1-7)/ACE2/MasR pathway, the latter able both to deactivate angiotensin II and counter its effects. The pharmacology of the angiotensin-(1-7)/ACE2/MasR pathway, in contrast to the angiotensin II/ACE1/AT1R/aldosterone pathway, has been little explored, but some in-vitro studies showed beneficial cardiovascular impact when activated, possibly involving GMPc-elevation (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . ACE2 has also been reported to interact with the angiotensin-1 receptor AT1R, targeted by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). ARBs counter AT1R-mediated effects of angiotensin II, thus stimulating angiotensin II liberation; in response to this increase in angiotensin II, they thus increase ACE2 expression [9] . Moreover, ACE2 via the Mas receptors, can heterooligomerize with the AT1 receptor and by so doing inhibit the actions of angiotensin II and therefore play a pivotal role in angiotensin II regulation [10] . ACE2 seems to be expressed by the cells of various organs, including heart, brain, kidney, vessels, digestive tract, testicles, adipose tissues, and lung [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

As a membrane enzyme with an extracellular domain, ACE2 seems to provide the entry into the human cells of SARS COV2/COVID-19, and therefore acts as a receptor for this coronavirus ( Fig.   1 ) [11, 17] . Precise identification of the SARS COV2 spike glycoproteins and their ACE2 binding site shows the latter to be identical to that of SARS COV [18] , despite the two viruses being distinct and showing no more than 80% homology. The spike protein on the viral surface of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to ACE2 with 10-20 times the affinity of SARS-CoV-1, the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003 [19, 20] . The higher ACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 may explain the ease of human-to-human transmission in the current pandemic. This spike protein activation by TMPRSS2 proteases followed by SARS COV2 binding to the extracellular domain of membrane ACE2 explains how the virus binds to and penetrates the cell ( Fig. 1 in reference [5] ).",

The exact roles, however, are complex and may be deleterious in the contamination phase, as ACE2 acts as a receptor to COVID-19 (and severity may correlate with membrane expression and tissue activity) [25, 26] while being beneficial in the inflammatory lesion phase [5, 27] . Many questions remain unanswered to date. To our knowledge, there are no pharmacologic ACE2 activators or inhibitors available to date in humans while some ACE2 activators are currently used for in vitro experiments and/or for veterinary use, including xanthenone and diminazene aceturate, an antiparasitic drug [28] . ACE2 activators have demonstrated in vitro interesting antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties that could represent a valuable therapeutic option in SARS-COV2 infection in humans [29] . Some groups suggested using circulating soluble ACE2 to capture as many viruses as possible in plasma, restricting their fixation on cell-membrane ACE2 and thus limiting cell infection. In-vitro studies showed that genetically engineered recombinant soluble ACE2 could be a useful therapeutic option [17, 30] . Moreover, soluble ACE2 might favor the angiotensin-(1-7)/ACE2/MasR pathway over the angiotensin II/ACE/AT1R/aldosterone pathway, preventing or treating severe inflammatory tissue lesions (11) .",

The clinical situation (infection contracted, not yet contracted, patient with or without cardiovascular history and COVID-19 infection) probably plays a major role. Some studies reported high levels of ACEi/ARB in COVID-19 cases, and especially in severe forms requiring hospital or ICU admission, although it should be noticed that arterial hypertension is very common in the general population, especially in the elderly, for which ACEi/ARB is prescribed in 25-30% of cases [5] . Thus the positive or negative impact of ACEi/ARB in COVID-19 in humans remains unknown and appears complex [50] , possibly even depending on clinical stage (viral contamination phase versus tissue inflammation phase) [51, 52] . Studies of this question are forthcoming (NCT04330300). Early data extracted from a retrospective cohort performed in China are in favor of a protective impact on overall mortality of ACEis/ARBs but these results must be consider with caution because of the presence of several potential confounders factors not included in analyses [53] . In line with in vitro results, it is suggested that ARBs but not ACEis may confer protection in COVID-19 infection by preventing onset of severe tissue lesions [25, 54] ; two clinical trials of losartan (ARB) in COVID-19, with or without hospital admission, are due to be launched (NCT04312009 and NCT04311177).",

To prevent onset of severe inflammatory tissue lesions, especially in the lung, on the other hand, the angiotensin-(1-7)/ACE2/MasR pathway should be favored to the angiotensin II/ACE/AT1R/aldosterone pathway in order to increase ACE2 membrane expression and/or tissue activity as pharmacological and therapeutic target (e.g., by ARBs).
