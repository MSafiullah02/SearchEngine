            "text": "In daily life, influenza might seem almost banal: how many of us get through the winter without a bout of flu? For those concerned with global health, however, few diseases provoke more unease. Influenza's history evokes the great themes of modern medicine: the insecure relationship between clinical knowledge and effective treatments; medicine's growing role in global networks of control; and the importance of memory and uncertainty in our responses to disease.",

Hippocrates, inevitably, is credited with the first description of influenza, although more compelling accounts have been found in European case records from the 12th century. \u201cInfluenza\u201d seems to have come into English in the mid-18th century, from the Italian influenza di freddo, \u201cthe influence of the cold [wind]\u201d\u2014a turn of phrase reflecting classical views on environment and disease.",

            "text": "Influenza became modern in the summer of 1889, as an epidemic in Bukhara (now in Uzbekistan) turned into a pandemic of so-called Russian influenza. In an age of railways and steam trains, the disease spread swiftly, while industrial nations met it with a new kind of scientific medicine rooted in the laboratory, the microscope, and germ theory. Within a few years, most clinicians accepted that \u201cPfeiffer's bacillus\u201d\u2014a bacterium (Haemophilus influenza) identified by the German bacteriologist Richard Pfeiffer\u2014was the cause of influenza.",

            "text": "In spring 1918, as Allied armies on the Western Front faced the last major German offensive, influenza began once more to spread around the world. The 1918\u201319 pandemic went on to infect perhaps a billion people in three waves, and killed at least 50 million. Societies already under immense wartime pressure faced near-collapse: hospitals and morgues were overwhelmed, transport and communications suffered staffing crises, and many governments closed schools, theatres, and churches. Their doctors, meanwhile, armed with Pfeiffer's work and newly confident in the power of germ theory, encountered a pandemic that was evidently infectious but that resisted all attempts at identification and treatment.",

The League of Nations Health Organization, the predecessor of WHO, was given the task of monitoring influenza outbreaks, and in the UK the new Ministry of Health initiated a search for the pathogen at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR). \u201cPfeiffer's bacillus\u201d initially retained some support, but this dwindled after a team at the NIMR, led by the British physiologist Walter Morley Fletcher, linked influenza to a new class of pathogen\u2014viruses\u2014in 1933. The new discipline of immunology offered a way to distinguish different viral strains, by the haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) antigens on the virus coat.",

Subsequent pandemics\u2014so-called Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1968, and the 1976 swine flu scare in the USA\u2014highlighted the way in which new strains of influenza could emerge from natural reservoirs, notably pigs and wildfowl. HIV/AIDS provoked fresh interest in the largely forgotten 1918\u201319 pandemic, but the appearance of avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome in the 1990s established a new cultural pattern for influenza outbreaks: travel restrictions, mass culls of pigs and chickens, intensive media interest, and worldwide anxiety.",

It is not clear whether even a coordinated global public health response would stop a new and more virulent pandemic. As we wait to find out, we might ask: what can medicine do to address the panic and uncertainty that characterise so many encounters with influenza?",
