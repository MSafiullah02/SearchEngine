SARS CoV infection afflicted about 8,000 humans and resulted in about 800 deaths, worldwide. Disease severity has been linked to age, with approximate mortality rates of <1% under 24 years of age, 6% for ages 15-44, 15% for ages 45-64, and >50% over 65. Many survivors have suffered long-lasting lung and cardiac complications. 5 The underlying mechanisms governing SARS-CoV pathogenesis are only now being unraveled. 9 SARS-CoV is a zoonotic pathogen that crossed the species barrier, the most likely host being civet cats and raccoon dogs, although virus has also been isolated or detected from domesticated cats, swine, and rodents. 4 Aggressive public health efforts contained the 2003 epidemic but it is unclear whether the epidemic strains are extinct in the wild.
