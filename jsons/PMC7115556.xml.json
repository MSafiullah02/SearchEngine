            "text": "Influenza vaccination is recommended for all individuals 6 months and older who do not have contraindications [1]. However, acceptance of the influenza vaccine has many barriers including low perceived vaccine efficacy, low perceived susceptibility to influenza infection, lack of understanding of the potential for severe illness from influenza, inconvenience, and fear of adverse effects [2], [3], [4]. Parents as well as adult patients have expressed concern that acute respiratory illness (ARI) occurs after the influenza vaccine; in a national survey, 43% of adults held the belief that \u201cthe flu vaccine can give you the flu.\u201d [2], [5] Plausible explanations for patient-perceived illness immediately following vaccination include: fever or other side effects induced by inflammatory mediators, influenza infection prior to vaccine-induced immunity, or coincidental infection with other respiratory pathogens [6], [7], [8]. Additionally, immunologic interference related to vaccination may modify the risk of ARI in potentially different ways. For example, lack of viral interference has been hypothesized to increase the risk of ARI after influenza vaccination while temporary non-specific immunity has been hypothesized to decrease the risk of ARI after influenza vaccination [8], [9], [10].",

For example, some studies included study populations recruited from cases of medically attended illness which may not reliably estimate the population incidence of ARI [11]. Use of a cohort study design comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals may be better, but can also be prone to bias if groups are not well-matched groups and/or unmeasured confounders exist [10]. Additionally, previous investigations of ARI risk after vaccination, lacking a biologically plausible temporal relationship to the vaccine may not accurately estimate risk of ARI attributed to the vaccine itself [9].",

We hypothesized that there would not be an increased risk of influenza, non-influenza respiratory pathogens, or symptoms without pathogen detected in the post-influenza vaccination risk periods. An understanding of the risk of illness in the post-vaccination period may be used to develop targeted anticipatory guidance for parents and adult patients considering influenza vaccination.",

Each season start date was September 1, concurrent with typical availability of influenza vaccines. The end dates of each season varied to capture all cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza in the cohort. For this sub-analysis, children 6 months to 17 years of age were eligible if they had any vaccines recorded in the NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) Immunization Registry and/or the New York Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR). Children who received two doses of influenza vaccine were excluded from the analysis of the season in which they received two doses due to potential challenges with interpreting events occurring during the partially vaccinated window between vaccinations. Because there is not a citywide registry for adult vaccinations, adults \u226518 years of age were eligible if they were patients at NYP, an academic health care delivery system that includes an ambulatory care network which provides primary care to New York City\u2019s underserved communities, and had \u22651 primary care visit or hospitalization between October 1 and the end of the study season of interest.

A time-varying variable was used for the three vaccination statuses. Because multiple ARIs can be reported by the same subject over the course of the study periods and repeat events from the same subject may be correlated, a frailty model was used. The frailty model includes a random variable in the Cox model in order to adjust for potential unmeasured confounders [19], [20]. All models were adjusted for season using a time-varying covariate (Autumn: September-November, Winter: December-February, Spring: March-May/June) and three time-independent covariates: age (categorized by years: \u22644, 5\u201317, 18\u201349, and \u226550), gender, and prior diagnosis of chronic respiratory condition (collected as reported asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or chronic inhaler use).

Similarly, consistent with randomized controlled trials, ARI symptoms without a detected pathogen was not higher in individuals during the immediate 2 days following vaccination compared with individuals unvaccinated [17], [21], [22]. Unexpectedly, among children <18 years, but not adults, there was a higher hazard of ARIs caused by non-influenza pathogens during the 14-days post-vaccination and other vaccinated days compared to unvaccinated children during the same time periods. Despite a higher hazard, the absolute number of vaccinated individuals who experienced ARI in the post-vaccination risk period was low (\u22643%).

The influenza vaccine has demonstrated reduction in morbidity and mortality across age groups and baseline health statuses [21], [23]. Additionally, others have also suggested that interference can occur between respiratory viruses that may offer protection, including against influenza infection [6], [24]. For example, epidemiologic studies have shown that when peak incidence of one major virus occurs, other major viruses are absent [25], [26].

            "text": "Prior studies have shown conflicting results in the post-influenza vaccination risk of ARI. Similar to our findings, two studies found an increased risk of laboratory-confirmed non-influenza infections in vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children in the months following vaccination [9], [10]. However, in two large vaccine safety studies researchers did not find an increased risk of medically attended illness in the two weeks following vaccination compared with control periods before and after vaccination [28], [29]. The limited periods evaluated in some of these studies and the outcomes of medically attended illness may not capture the true incidence of ARI post-vaccination [13]. Studies conducted during a single influenza season may have limited generalizability because of heterogeneity among circulating respiratory viruses and influenza vaccine-virus antigenic matches in different influenza seasons [9], [10], [11]. Our study attempted to overcome some of these limitations as it was conducted over three consecutive influenza seasons, included non-medically attended events, and examined an extended post-vaccination period. Our study design also minimized recall bias as ARI outcomes were collected through year-round surveillance using text-messaging and at-home nasal swab collection independent of exposure to the influenza vaccine. In support of our study design, we found expected results for the association of participant characteristics and seasonality with laboratory confirmed ARI. For example, children had a greater hazard than adults for non-influenza ARI throughout the study seasons [30]. The associations between chronic respiratory conditions and Spring with ARI without detectable pathogens may be suggestive of seasonal allergies [31], [32].",

We adjusted for important covariates in our analytic model; however, there is a potential for unmeasured confounding. Because our study population was predominantly uniform for characteristics such as ethnicity, multigenerational household size, urban neighborhood, and low socioeconomic status, we did not adjust for these variables which may affect rates of ARI and limit external validity. Our inclusion criteria were designed to minimize misclassification of vaccination status. Because there is no city registry for adult immunizations, it is possible that some adults included in the study had missing vaccination data if they were vaccinated outside of the hospital system. However, in our sensitivity analysis including only vaccinated adults we did not find a difference in the relative hazards of ARI compared to the estimates including all adults. In our statistical model, we did not adjust for co-administration of other vaccines which may affect the risk of systemic side effects after vaccination.",
