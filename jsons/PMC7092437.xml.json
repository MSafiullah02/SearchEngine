Similar to critically ill patients, increased AKI severity is associated with increased mortality in OHCA patients [2, 4, 9]. In contrast, recovery from AKI was a potent predictor of survival and good neurological outcome at discharge [5]. Mortality rates of patients with stage 3 AKI after OHCA are reported to be over 70% [2, 3]. Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a treatment option for these patients, its impact on outcomes is uncertain. We hypothesised that applying RRT would be associated with better outcomes in patients who develop severe AKI after OHCA.",

On the contrary, one of them reported a significant increase in mortality among patients receiving RRT [11]. The two studies did not consider AKI stage in their comparison of outcomes in patients with and without RRT. Because all patients who received RRT had stage 3 AKI, the risk of death in the RRT group was higher than that in the non-RRT group. Therefore, this study evaluated whether dialysis interventions had an impact on the outcomes of patients with stage 3 AKI after OHCA who were treated with targeted temperature management (TTM).",

            "text": "The present study has several limitations. First, because we defined AKI using only SCr criteria, it is possible that we underestimated AKI prevalence in our cohort. In the case of critically ill patients, the production of SCr decreases. Additionally, a decrease in SCr could be potentiated by therapeutic hypothermia [26]. Therefore, an exact judgement on AKI status is difficult in the case of individuals treated with therapeutic hypothermia. In addition, differences in urine output and fluid balance are likely to have influenced the decision to start RRT. However, data on urine output at RRT initiation and fluid balance could not be evaluated in our cohort. Second, the present study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected observational data that did not include information on standardised treatments or management protocols for RRT. Therefore, the risk of selection bias could have been introduced. Third, the initiation of RRT in our study was at the discretion of the physician responsible for the patient\u2019s care according to the KDIGO guideline (e.g., severe hyperkalaemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary oedema, and uremic complication). There were no consistent protocols dictating when to initiate RRT, which might have led to inconsistencies in practices among the principal investigators of each institution. A randomised controlled trial of RRT on patients with stage 3 AKI is needed to confirm the role of RRT. Fourth, there was a possibility of failure to conduct RRT even if urgent RRT was indicated because of the decision on withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy according to the neurological prognostication. However, in South Korea, the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy depending on the neurological prognostication has not been used widely because of several reasons. For instance, the life-sustaining treatment decisions act was only applied recently in South Korea (since February 2018). In addition, legal surrogates, including family members, could not determine withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, especially stopping the ventilator or removing the endotracheal tube owing to traditional sentiment. Therefore, we expect that decisions regarding withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy may not affect the initiation of RRT. However, there was a possibility that RRT may be stopped when a poor neurological outcome or death was expected through the treatment course, as the cost for RRT (especially continuous RRT) is quite expensive in South Korea (approximately \u20ac400 per day). Fifth, in the cohort of RRT (n = 115), 80 patients were diagnosed as achieving stage 3 AKI by initiating RRT itself (Group A) and 35 patients were diagnosed as achieving stage 3 AKI based on SCr (Group B). Although the initiation of RRT was not determined by conditions other than SCr in most cases, daily SCr of Group B was significantly higher than that of Group A (see Additional file 1, Table S2). Therefore, it may be possible to compare patients reaching the AKI stage 3 by non-creatinine criteria with patients reaching the AKI stage 3 by creatinine criteria. The sixth limitation is that the results of the present study may have been affected by the characteristics of our study cohort. Therefore, the results might not be reproducible in another cohort with different characteristics. Fifth, although we excluded the patients who died within 48 h from the time of ROSC initiation to decrease problems related to competing risk, excluding these patients itself may have introduced bias.",
