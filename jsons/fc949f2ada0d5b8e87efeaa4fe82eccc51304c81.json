            "text": "A rapid, sensitive, and accurate laboratory diagnostic test is needed for distinguishing Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) from other diseases featuring similar clinical symptoms and also for preventing potential outbreaks. In this study, a TaqMan reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for rapid detection and quantification of the viral RNA of various JEV strains. A consensus JEV NS3 region was chosen to design the primers and the TaqMan probe. The JEV TaqMan assay used the EZ-rTtH RT-PCR system featuring advantages such as a one-step, high-temperature RT reaction modality and preventing carry-over contamination. The sensitivity of the JEV TaqMan assay for detecting in vitro-transcribed JEV NS3 RNA was estimated to be one to five copies of RNA per reaction. For cultured JE virions, less than 40 plaque forming unit (PFU)/ml of virus load (corresponding to 0.07 PFU/test) could be detected. In addition, the JEV TaqMan assay could detect all seven strains of JEV tested, but provided negative results for nine other flaviviruses and encephalitis viruses tested. The JEV TaqMan assay demonstrated greater sensitivity and specificity than traditional RT-PCR methods as has been previously reported. The application of the JEV TaqMan assay herein has been shown to the sensitive detection of the JEV from both mosquito pools and also JEV-spiking human blood. The assay should be of use in diagnostic laboratory conduct and could be used to replace or complement time-consuming viral-culture methods, thus achieving more rapid, sensitive, and highly specific identification of JEV infection.",

The virus is epidemic in many parts of India, China, and South-east Asia [Solomon et al., 2000] . During epidemic periods, fatality rates as high as 20% have been noted, particularly amongst the immunologically naive and those at the extremes of the age spectrum [Tsai, 2000] . Numerically, it is the most important cause of epidemic encephalitis; its geographical area of influence is expanding despite the availability of vaccines [Solomon and Mallewa, 2001] .",

It is noteworthy, however, that serological methods reflect inherently limited levels of sensitivity and specificity and may not diagnose accurately infection at a sufficiently early stage for optimal disease management. JEV can be isolated frequently from the blood of affected patients during the early phase of acute encephalitis illness, when IgM antibodies may not be detectable [Monath and Heinz, 1996] . However, virus isolation and identification with a JEV specific monoclonal antibody requires the use of cellculture assays that are technique-dependent and timeconsuming [Gubler et al., 1984] .

Further, this assay can generate results within 3 hr, and does not require a time-consuming sample set-up, a secondary PCR amplification step, or any post-PCR gels. The closed-tube detection technique and the AmpErase uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) treatment process eliminate the potential sources of carryover contamination and reduce the false-positive rate associated with more conventional RT-PCR techniques [Kwok and Higuchi, 1989 ]. The assay also provides a quantitative viral RNA assay result simultaneously. The development of this assay provides a powerful diagnostic tool for the identification of JEV infection for subsequent patient management and rapid vector control.",

NS3 is a highly conserved region among flaviviruses [Westaway and Blok, 1997] , and plays an important role in viral RNA replication [Utama et al., 2000] . To avoid the cross detection with other flaviviruses, we did not choose the more conserved regions-NS5, which are the target regions for performing flavivirus-common molecular detection [Scaramozzino et al., 2001] . The relatively highly conserved structure and function of the NS3 makes it to be a logical region for developing a consensus PCR assay which could be used for detection of most JE strains. The JEV NS3 primers and TaqMan probe were designed to match the TaqMan condition using the Primer Express Oligo Design software (Version 1.5, Applied Biosystems). The optimal primers and probe set which were suitable for most JEV strains were thus selected ( Table I ). The sequences of primer and probe were checked by Blast web service (National Center for Biotechnology Information) to assure no nonspecific detection with other host and/or pathogen genes. According to a computer search, the sequences of JEV NS3 TaqMan primers and probe could be annealed perfectly with the sequences of many strains of JEV.",

The relative sensitivity of the JEV NS3 TaqMan assay proved to be even more substantial than the one-step RT-PCR assay using the most sensitive sensiscript RT (Table II) . The relative sensitivities of the two assays were also compared by detecting the in vitro-transcribed JEV NS3 RNA ( Fig. 2A) which could serve as the standard positive control. The JEV NS3 TaqMan assay yielded a 100% detection rate for five copies of NS3 RNA and a 66.7% detection rate for one copy (Figs. 1B and 2B; Table II) , while the one-step RT-PCR assay revealed approximately a five-to-ten-fold lower sensitivity ( Fig. 2B ; Table II ). The traditional nested RT-PCR primer assays [Murakami et al., 1994] were also used to detect these samples in order to compare with these one-step JEV NS3 RT-PCR and JEV NS3 TaqMan RT-PCR assays. The sensitivity of this nested PCR technique did not differ greatly from that of the JEV NS3 TaqMan RT-PCR assay; however, the nested PCR technique is relatively complex, time-consuming, and frequently, difficult for interpretation of results (data not shown).",

The relative sensitivity of the assay to most strains of JEV appeared to be quite similar to that of the NT 113 strain (Table III) , although the sensitivity of the assay for detecting the JE NaKayama strain appeared to be about 10-fold less than for the other strains. The detection rate for the NaKayama strain was 100% for 10 PFU per reaction, however.",

To our knowledge, the purified in vitro-transcribed NS3 RNA can serve as the appropriate standard control for absolute quantitation. The fact that we did observe a greater level of sensitivity for cultured JE virions than for NS3 RNA (0.07 PFU vs. five copies of RNA) may result from the presence of defective virions in cultured JE virions which may thus contribute to the observed sensitivity difference between molecular diagnosis and plaque assay techniques. The sensitivities of JEV-infected mosquitoes (100% detection rate at 1.13 PFU/test) and JEV-spiked human sera (100% detection rate at 4.48 PFU/test) demonstrated that a variety of dirty specimens could be analyzed in our assay system without apparent inhibitors. The enterovirus spike experiments demonstrate that the real-time TaqMan PCR assay can be applied to different clinical specimens, such as plasma, serum, CSF, and NT swab, providing timely and accurate diagnosis of viral infection status without apparent inhibition [Nijhuis et al., 2002] . The level of this inhibition effect in mosquito specimens (Sakallah et al., unpublished data) appeared to be notably lower for JEV EZrTth RT-PCR TaqMan assay than for other RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR assays. In this study, the primers were used for real-time, one-step SYBR green RT-PCR assay for the samples shown in Tables II and III . This assay avoids the usage of TaqMan probe, which is more expensive and labile. The SYBR green RT-PCR assay has shown similar sensitivity but less specificity (i.e., less cross-reactivity with West Nile virus and Dengue virus serotype 2) than JEV NS3 TaqMan assay. The national JEV vaccination policy has been implemented since 1968 in Taiwan, and as a consequence, it would appear that JE and associated outbreaks are well controlled [Wu et al., 1999] ; and thus, the assays described in this report including JEV NS3 TaqMan and SYBR green assays will likely have more application for JEV diagnosis and surveillance in other JEV-endemic areas (Fig. 4) .",

The C T results of the TaqMan RT-PCR assay of six different human sera each featuring four different virus loadings are shown on the vertical axis. The detection rates are 100% for JEV viremia sera with 4 \u00c2 10 6 , 4 \u00c2 10 4 , 4 \u00c2 10 2 PFU/ml. There seemed to be no difference in detection rate between JEV Ab positive (*,&,}) and negative (~,&,^) sera.",
