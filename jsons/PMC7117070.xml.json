Therefore, further studies in Jordan are warranted to highlight the burden of viral ARI/ALRI caused by RSV to convince policy makers of the necessity of prevention. In addition, identifying the etiology and the frequency of other viruses causing ARI/ALRI can guide practitioners in optimizing the management of patients with ARI/ALRI, such as avoiding the overuse of antibiotics, especially given that viral testing is not a routine practice in diagnosing children admitted to the hospitals with ARI/ALRI in Jordan. Identifying the risk factors for hospital admission and severe disease in young children with ARI/ALRI is vital to accurately estimating the morbidity and mortality associated with ARI/ALRI and thus the burden imposed on individuals and health system in Jordan.\n",

These patients were classified as having ALRI if they presented with cough or difficulty breathing in addition to tachypnea or any other symptom or sign indicative of lower respiratory tract infection, including retractions, flaring, grunting, wheezing, and crackles. Severe ALRI was defined as the presence of cough or difficulty breathing in addition to one or more of the following: retractions, nasal flaring, grunting, oxygen saturation (SpO\n2\n) < 90% at room air, altered mental status, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or patient death.\n19\n",

A chronic illness presented in 15.9% of patients. The diagnosis upon admission was bronchiolitis in 49.7%, bronchopneumonia in 23.0%, and pneumonia in 15.2% of the children. The remaining children had other diagnoses, including asthma exacerbation, rule out sepsis, croup, pertussis-like illness, CF exacerbation, and fever for investigation. The mean (SD) LoS was 3.56 (2.4) days. Three patients died; one was positive for HMPV, and the other two were not positive for any of the tested viruses (bacterial cultures were negative in all patients who died).\n",

RSV was identified as the most common viral cause of ARI. Other viruses, such as HMPV, should be considered as the etiology for severe ALRI. Risk factors for increased LoS and severe disease presentation of ALRI were determined in the population of Northern Jordan. Exclusive breast feeding was essential in decreasing the severity of ALRI. These findings are crucial for stakeholders in the health care system, to prioritize health care interventions, particularly in settings with limited resources. Laboratory confirmation of viral etiology would help minimize antibiotic use in managing ARI. This study may also aid measures to implement future strategies for RSV vaccination when available.",
