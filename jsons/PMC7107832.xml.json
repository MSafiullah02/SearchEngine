The presence of SARS-CoV on surfaces is always a concern, although few studies in which live virus has been successfully isolated from an environmental surface have been reported. Surfaces were usually contaminated with patient's droplets or by indirect transfer of virus from gloves that were contaminated with excreted virus. The increase in the isolation rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at the intensive care unit of a Hong Kong hospital during the SARS outbreak suggested that increased cross-contamination could occur if gloves and gowns were worn all of the time [9]. It is important to gather evidence of the survival of SARS-CoV on surfaces so that appropriate infection-control measures can be taken.",

The virus can survive for 4 days at room temperature after being spiked in diarrheal stool with an alkaline pH. This observation lends evidence that fecal droplets containing SARS-CoV remain infectious for a period of time.

In the present study, we compared the survival of SARS-CoV on 2 types of gowns: disposable gowns and cotton gowns. Our results showed that, even with a high concentration of virus (105 TCID50/mL), the droplets will lose all infectivity after 1 h on cloth, compared with 24 h needed for the disposable gown. Apparently, droplets will be absorbed more quickly on cotton material than on fluid-repellent material. The present data show that an ordinary cotton gown offers reasonable protection against small droplets containing SARS-CoV. Our study also raises the possibility that any droplets that hang on a nonabsorbent disposable gown may pose a risk of contaminating the environment when health care workers wear the gown all of the time or when they try to remove the gown. A similar conclusion may also be drawn for gloves, although gloves were not tested in the present study. A specially designed disposable garment with a fluid-repellent lamination that has an outer fluid-absorbing sheet may offer better protection for the personnel.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV is a newly discovered virus. Thus far, there have only been a few reports of its survival characteristics [15]. Here, we demonstrate that this deadly virus can remain infectious for a long period in stool specimens. The samples that we spiked with SARS-CoV were incubated in closed containers during the entire period of incubation, simulating the conditions in a sewage drainage pipe. Thus, our results showed that, in this situation, droplets may be a concern with regard to disease transmission, as occurred in the Amoy Gardens outbreaks. This has significant implications for sewage treatment in both domestic and hospital environments. Fortunately, this virus is also susceptible to drying. We showed that, when virus-containing droplets were dried, the virus was inactivated rapidly on paper and cotton cloth. Transmission through droplet-contaminated paper and cotton gowns is unlikely, and common household detergents can be effective decontaminating agents for use in the laboratory and hospital.",
