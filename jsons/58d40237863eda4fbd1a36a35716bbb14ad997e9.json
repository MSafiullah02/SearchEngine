The disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the COVID-19. In this study, bioinformatics approaches were employed to design and introduce a novel multi-epitope vaccine against 2019-nCoV that can potentially trigger both CD 4\u00fe and CD 8\u00fe T-cell immune responses and investigated its biological activities by computational tools. Three known antigenic proteins (Nucleocapsid, ORF3a, and Membrane protein, hereafter called NOM) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic B and T-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools. Based on in silico analysis, we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate (NOM) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored T and B-cell epitopes. After predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate, the best 3 D predicted model was applied for docking studies with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and HLA-A \u00c3 11:01. In the next step, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with TLR4 and HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 receptors. MD studies demonstrated that the NOM-TLR4 and NOM-HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time. In silico evaluation showed that the designed chimeric protein could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.",

Scientists from all over the world are attempting to investigate this novel virus, known as 2019-nCoV, which is highly contagious, and to discover effective interventions to control and prevent the disease (Heymann, 2020; Huang et al., 2020) . Coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (ssRNA \u00fe ) belonging to the Coronaviridae family. Human Coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 are observed in almost one-third of the common cold (Lim et al., 2016) . However, recently some cases of human coronavirus infections have led to fatal endemics, including SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and COVID-19 that are common diseases between humans and animals whose belong to the genus Betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014) . So far, the novel COVID-19 has caused more than 700,000 illnesses and more than 33,000 deaths worldwide (W.H.O., 2020) . The genome size of this virus is about 30 kb and encodes structural and non-structural proteins like other coronaviruses. Structural proteins include S protein (Spike), E protein (Envelope), M protein (Membrane), and N protein (Nucleocapsid) (Ahmed et al., 2020) . The increasing rate of COVID-19 disease and the high morbidity necessitate the development of a specific and safe vaccine candidate as soon as possible. There is very little known actually about the pathogenesis of the virus; therefore, an immunoinformatics-based approach to investigate the immunogenic epitopes and vaccine design using data from proteins sequencing of the COVID-19 is required.",

This data showed that N protein is a suitable candidate for targeting drug and vaccine design because this protein is conserved, antigenic and multifunctional (6).

            "text": "Since the COVID-19 has been recently discovered, little immunological information is available. Preliminary studies based on phylogenetic analyses of the COVID-19 whole genome have suggested that this virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV (79.7% Identify) (9, 14) . Given the apparent similarity between the two viruses, it could be concluded that previous studies on the protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may be useful for developing a vaccine for COVID-19. Previous studies have suggested that both humoral and cellular immunity play important roles in protective responses against this virus (Deming et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2004) . Studies revealed that the formation of antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV, an immunogenic protein that is highly expressed during infection, is relatively common in patients infected with this virus (Liu et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2003) . Although these antibodies are effective, they have a shorter lifespan in recovering the patients. In addition to the specific humoral immunity, it has been shown that the CD 4\u00fe and CD 8\u00fe responses provide long-lasting protection against COVID-19. These studies showed that besides antibody-mediated immune response, cellular immunity is critical to induce protectivity in these infections (Liu et al., 2017) . The concept of a multi-epitope vaccine is to efficiently identify and assemble B and T-cell epitopes that are more capable of stimulating the immune system and therefore can induce more potent and effective both arms of immune responses. Peptides and epitopes have shown to be desirable candidates for vaccine development due to their relatively easy production, chemical stability, and lack of infectious potential (Patronov & Doytchinova, 2013) . The experimental design and production of multi-epitope vaccines have improved dramatically in recent years. These vaccines are mainly made up of B-cell, CD 8\u00fe cytolytic T-cell (CTLs) and CD 4\u00fe helper T-cells (HTLs) epitopes (Chiarella et al., 2009) . Since the antigenic epitopes of a protein could be predicted and detected, therefore the whole protein is not suitable to stimulate an immune response (Testa & Philip, 2012; Zheng et al., 2017) . During the development of a vaccine candidate against COVID-19, complex pathogenic mechanisms and numerous pathogenic factors should be considered in vaccine formulation.",

All of the MD simulations were done by GROMACS 2018 package (Abraham et al., 2015) and OPLS-AA force field (Jorgensen et al., 1996) . The monomer form of each protein and also the docked complexes were placed in the center of a triclinic box with a distance of 1 nm from all edges and solvated with TIP3P water model (Jorgensen et al., 1983) . Then, sodium and chloride ions were added to produce a neutral physiological salt concentration of 150 mM. Each system was energy minimized, using the steepest descent algorithm, until the Fmax was found to be smaller than 10 kJ.mol \u00c01 nm \u00c01 . All of the covalent bonds were constrained using the Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) algorithm (Hess et al., 1997) to maintain constant bond lengths. The longrange electrostatic interactions were treated using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method (Darden et al., 1993; Essmann et al., 1995) and the cut off radii for Coulomb and Van der Waals short-range interactions were set to 0.9 nm. Then 100 ps NVT (constant number of particles (N), volume (V), and temperature (T)) and 300 ps NPT (constant number of particles (N), pressure (P), and temperature (T)) equilibrations were performed for each system. After the necessary equilibrations, 100 ns of production run were performed for each of the four complexes. Finally, simulations were carried out under the periodic boundary conditions (PBC), set at XYZ coordinates to ensure that the atoms had stayed inside the simulation box, and the subsequent analyses were then performed using GROMACS utilities, VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996) and USCF Chimera, and also the plots and the figures were created using Daniel's XL Toolbox (v 7.3.2) add-in (Kraus, 2014) ",

The interaction between these receptors and NOM recombinant protein induce different immune responses. To achieve a stable and relaxed state of the NOM recombinant protein and the immune receptors, a MD simulation of 100 ns was performed for each structure. These simulations ensure that the structures are stable enough to be used for protein-protein molecular docking. After 100 ns of the production run, as it is shown in Figure 5 , the RMSD (Root Mean Square Distance) values of the monomers show that the backbone structure of TLR4 (PDB ID: 2Z62) is very rigid and stable. The structure of the NOM recombinant protein also reached stability after about 25 ns after a considerable structural change. The backbone structure of the HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 (PDB ID: 5WJL), however, showed big spikes in the RMSD values but all three structures were visually inspected and were considered stable enough for the next step of the project.",

            "text": "To find the best orientation for optimal interaction of the NOM protein with the immune receptors we decided to use protein-protein molecular docking. We used PatchDock webserver which concentrates on recognizing and matching patterns of the surfaces of the proteins to put them in the best possible positions. Afterward, the top 10 best solutions were subjected to the Firedock webserver to refine the docked structures. The FireDock algorithms refine the docked complexes by side-chain rearrangement and soft rigid-body optimization. The ranking of the docked complexes is based on short-range, long-range, attractive and repulsive interaction energies between the residues of the two proteins, which are all summed up in the global energy or the binding energy of the complexes. We considered global energy as the main criterion for choosing the best complexes and chose the two top-scored solutions with the best global energy. As it is shown in Table 6 , the solution numbers 5 and 6 from the NOM-TLR4 complex and the solution numbers 2 and 3, from NOM-HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 complex, were chosen for further calculations. The total energy plots of the simulations are shown in Figure 6 . The results showed a strong interaction between designed protein amino acids and receptors. The interactions between the binding receptors and the docked NOM protein were visualized using the UCSF Chimera program. Residues of HLA-A \u00c3 1101(GLU 53 , ASN 174 , GLY 56 , ASN 174 , GLU 53 , PRO 57 ) participated in the After the protein-protein molecular docking, 4 solutions were chosen for MD simulation, solution numbers 2 and 3 from NOM protein-HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 complex and solution numbers 5 and 6 from NOM protein-TLR4 complex. Each was simulated for 100 ns. To examine their stability throughout the simulations period, the RMSD values of each protein was analyzed. As it is shown in Figure 7 , each protein has different RMSD values and in some of them, the backbone atoms have considerable movements during the simulations. The reason is that the interactions can get optimized and rearranged by introducing water molecules and physiological conditions. The RMSD values of TLR4 in NOM protein-TLR4 complexes and the values of HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 in NOM protein-HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 complexes are very stable and the average values do not reach very high values. However, the RMSD values of the NOM protein in every complex reach high values which means that the structure of the vaccine has more movements to refine the interactions with the immune receptors. However, the interactions between the NOM recombinant protein and the immune receptors are quite strong and MMPBSA binding energy calculations exhibit great binding energies. As it is shown in Table 7 , the Van der Waals and electrostatic energies of the complexes are strong enough to keep the two proteins in contact with each other. Moreover, the deviation of each value is very small which means that the interactions are very stable and consistent throughout the simulations. In another word, the higher scale of RMSD values with consistent binding energies only show that the structure of the NOM protein is well optimized for interacting with the immune receptors.",

As it is shown in Figure 8a , the RMSF values of NOM recombinant protein in five simulations indicate that the fluctuation of the monomer form of the vaccine in many regions is considerably more than the complex forms. This is a direct indication that the NOM recombinant protein is much more stable when it is in complex with the two immune receptors. Furthermore, the RMSF values of the NOM recombinant protein in complex with HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 are lower compared with that of NOM recombinant protein in complex with TLR4. Also, with the evidence that the binding energies are also lower, we can conclude that NOM recombinant protein can bind to the HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 better than the other immune receptor.",

We have predicted and validated NOM recombinant protein against HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 and TLR4 receptors. Our evaluation was based on vaccine candidate structural analysis and molecular docking and MD simulations study. The NOM-TLR4 and NOM-HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 complexes were very stable in their natural function with strong molecular interactions in around 100 ns. Higher binding energy even after the MD simulation of 100 ns confirmed the stability and specificity NOM-TLR4 and NOM-HLA-A \u00c3 11:01 interaction. Our vaccine candidate can stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity, given that B and T-cell epitopes have been selected in the final construct. Taken all together, according to physicochemical evaluations as well as structural and immunological analyses, NOM recombinant protein could be considered as a possible vaccine candidate against COVID-19.",
