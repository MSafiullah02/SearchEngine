At a fraction of 1% mortality for infected individuals, fatalities for a population the size of the US would be in the millions. This bleak estimate is in agreement with results from more elaborate calculations earlier presented by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 4 NPI measures should bring 0 down from 2.5 to about 1.0 for the infection rate to eventually reverse sign to negative, thus eventually resulting in low single digits for total percentage of infected individuals in a population ( Figure 1 ); or to below 1, for the epidemic to immediately start contracting. For example, it is reported that travel restrictions in Wuhan, China quickly brought 0 down from 2.35 to 1.05. 2 Similarly, recent projections by the US federal government for 200,000 fatalities correspond to 0 \u2248 1.03. 5 As a practical matter, current data on exponential growth of infections in various countries (widely available on the internet 6 ) indicate that extraordinary measures are needed for 0 to be drastically reduced. With a sizable asymptomatic period for infected individuals, universal restrictions on social contacts quickly emerged as a preferred NPI measure. 1 Figure 1 . Total fraction of a population infected and removed by the end of an epidemic as a function of the basic reproductive ratio 0 -the average number of secondary infections arising from an average primary infection in an entirely susceptible population, eqn. (2) -according to eqn. (7) . For 0 < 1 the virus does not spread and the epidemic is contained. Reports on data from Wuhan, China, estimate 0 dropping from 3 to 1 to 0.3 with each successive round of NPI measures implemented, 1 or from 2.35 to 1.05. 2 The sensitivity of the total infected fraction (and resulting critical care needs and fatalities) to small uncertainty in 0 makes accurate predictions difficult when 0 \u2248 1.",

However, in addition to flattening the curve, this reduction also has adverse effects felt by many, not least in terms of drastically reduced economic activity. Facing the inexorable conflict summarized as \"saving lives vs. saving the economy\" appears inevitable. The purpose of this publication is to help understand that conflict and contribute towards its mitigation by exploiting a simple and widely observed fact: That hospitalization and fatality rates are higher by at least an order of magnitude among the elderly and the vulnerable who are roughly 1/5 to 1/6 of the population ( Figure 2 ). 9, 10 Therefore, by shielding human contact for this high-risk group more than the low-risk group, the effective combined 0 could be improved, with commensurate reduction in hospitalization and fatality rates, without increasing adverse effects on the economy, as the most economically active group would face no additional restrictions on distancing. While numerical simulations on sophisticated models have included many cases of this kind of enhanced social distancing for the elderly, 9 the contribution of this paper is a simple way to quickly assess the effects of design parameters, such as cut-off age or distancing targets for high-and low-risk groups. The standard SIR model with two-subpopulations is used. Exact or approximate analytical solutions are obtained that can easily asses the effects of decision variables on outcomes such as hospitalization and critical care needs or fatalities. It is emphasized that the intent of the paper is not to advocate any particular policy. Rather, it purports to provide shortcut tools that both scientists and public officials can easily use in rapid what-if analysis of related ideas.",
