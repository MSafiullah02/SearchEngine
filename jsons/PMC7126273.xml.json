For instance, gastrointestinal or adipose tissue\u2013derived peptide hormones such as ghrelin, insulin, peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), and leptin signal to the brain the state of hunger or satiety or energy storage [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. In the brain, these peptides interact with neuronal circuitries expressing orexigenic neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AgRP), galanin, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and orexin or anorexigenic neuropeptides such as \u03b1-melanocyte\u2013stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), oxytocin, and vasopressin [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. In addition to appetite regulation, orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides are involved in mechanisms related to stress, sleep/wakefulness, and reproductive, defensive/aggressive, and social behaviors, thereby integrating appetite, emotions, and other homeostatic functions [13], [14], [15]. Moreover, there is evidence that neuropeptides known for their central sites of action, such as NPY, also contribute to the mechanisms of energy homeostasis via peripheral effects [16].",

In fact, levels of \u03b1-MSH autoAbs correlated with the core psychopathologic traits in patients with eating disorders [18]. Moreover, a recent study implicated T cells in the cholecystokinin-mediated control of food intake [19]. Other studies have revealed the existence of autoAbs directed against several other regulatory peptides including vasoactive intestinal peptide, bradykinin, and hypocretin [20], [21], [22]. In addition, since the initial reports of insulin autoAbs before insulin treatment [23], [24], abundant data on autoAbs directed against insulin in diabetes have been accumulated [25]. These studies have reported that autoAbs directed against regulatory peptides can be also present in apparently healthy subjects, a finding that might signify physiologic roles of these autoAbs, such as modulation of the binding of regulatory peptides to their receptors [18] or post-transcriptional modification [20]. However, because self-reacting Abs are normally associated with autoimmune diseases [26], the presence of autoAbs directed against regulatory peptides in healthy subjects remains largely unexplored.",

First, we examined healthy subjects for the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA autoAbs able to bind any of 14 regulatory peptides chosen for their key roles in mechanisms of appetite and body weight. The presence of the IgA class of autoAbs may point to a luminal, most commonly intestinal origin of the antigenic stimulation, including food-derived antigens and gut microflora [27].",

The IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin class in mucosal secretions and plays an important role by binding bacterial and viral antigens. In serum IgA accounts for 6\u201315% of total immunoglobulins. Although the systemic role of IgA has not been fully clarified, human peripheral blood neutrophils express Fc\u03b1 immunoglobulin receptors that may trigger IgA-mediated functional responses including phagocytosis or release of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 cytokines [29], [30]. In this study, we focused on the possible role of intestinal microflora in relation to neuropeptide autoAb response. However, the role of nutrients, as direct sources of antigens or as prebiotics, may also be important in this process. For instance, serum IgA antigliadin antibodies induced by a wheat protein comprise a well-established marker of celiac disease, but this antibody can also bind to neurons [31]. In contrast, IgG is the predominant class of immunoglobulins found in serum and it is the main molecule of adaptive immunity by activating complement and phagocytosis pathways. The presence of IgG reflects previous exposure to antigens.",

Blank OD values resulting from the reading of plates without addition of human sera were subtracted from the sample OD values. The optimal dilutions of human sera (1:100) were determined by dilution curves (1:50, 1:100, 1:200). Each determination was done in duplicate.

In a majority of cases, increasing concentrations of preadsorbing peptide were associated with reduced IgA and IgG autoAb binding, but several reverse responses such as with insulin were also observed.

The limited interest in insulin autoAbs in healthy subjects is probably related to the view that production of insulin autoAbs must be triggered by \u201cimmunogenic\u201d insulin derived from pancreatic \u03b2-cells destroyed by an autoimmune process, and the assumption that these autoAbs should reflect the disease [37].

In fact, the major role of commensal and pathogenic microflora in inducing IgA responses has been previously shown [38], [39], [40]. However, our results obtained from the germ-free rats show that commensal microflora are not required for the presence of IgA or IgG autoAbs directed against regulatory peptides but can selectively influence the levels of at least some of these autoAbs. For instance, the relatively lower levels of IgA autoAbs directed against AgRP, MCH, and CRH found in germ-free rats might be related to the absence of intestinal antigens. However, it appears that the presence of SPF rat microflora would inhibit the production of IgG autoAbs directed against ghrelin, suggesting a complex mechanism of interaction between microbial antigens and levels of IgG autoAbs. The potential ability of the microflora to selectively modulate the levels of some regulatory peptide autoAbs could also be related to the concept of molecular mimicry.",

According to the concept of molecular mimicry, the functional implications of such sequence similarities are possible only if the protein fragment targeted by self-reacting antibodies possesses biological activity [33]. For example, it has been shown that six consecutive amino acids shared between hepatitis B virus and myelin basic protein is sufficient to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [41]. In the case of regulatory peptides, which are released and function as messenger molecules, any part of their entire sequence targeted by autoAbs could result in modification of their biological activity. Radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical studies have shown that antibodies generated by immunization are able to selectively recognize regulatory peptides as small as the three-aa peptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone [42], [43]. In the present study, we recorded the presence of at least five identical consecutive aa fragments in regulatory peptides and microbial proteins qualifying as candidates for molecular mimicry [44]. However, as indicated above, it is important to note that sequences shorter than five amino acids could be implicated, in addition to discontinuous fragment homology. Of note, only a limited number of microbial protein sequences are currently available in the NCBI database, and molecular mimicry between regulatory peptides and microbial proteins may thus be more extensive.",

For instance, peptide fragments identical to leptin were found in proteins belonging to Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacilli bacteriophage, Yarrowia lipolytica, Candida, and Aspergillus species. Notably, the most frequent molecular mimicry (7\u201312 of the examined regulatory peptides) occurs with the class of fungi (Table 3). They include the commensal or relatively pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptococcus neoformans, the food-associated yeasts Y. lipolytica and Saccharomyces, and several plant fungi such as Neurospora crassa. Anorexigenic and orexigenic peptides displayed molecular mimicry with the same fungus, thus not allowing an association of a single fungus species with a potential specific effect on food intake. Among the commensal bacteria and viruses, sequence homology was often seen in Lactobacilli and their phages, bacteroides, and commensal strains of E. coli, which displayed molecular mimicry with leptin, insulin, ghrelin, PYY, NPY, AgRP, orexin, \u03b1-MSH, ACTH, oxytocin, or vasopressin. These results suggest that commensal microflora could trigger production of many autoAbs reactive with these regulatory peptides, and that eventually, under normal conditions, not a single regulatory peptide may escape this microbial-derived immune-mediated control.",

However, the functional implication of binding of such autoAbs to the regulatory peptide could be different depending on what part of the molecule was targeted. We found that sequence homologies were often different between commensal and pathogenic micro-organisms. For instance, commensal bacteroides have mimicry close to the carboxyl-terminal side of \u03b1-MSH, whereas pathogenic H. pylori displays homology with the larger part of its carboxyl-terminal and pathogenic E. coli strains with various regions of the peptide (Fig. 3A). It is well known that different parts of the \u03b1-MSH peptide have specific functions [55]. For example, the central core sequence HFRW is responsible for the binding of \u03b1-MSH to the appetite-related melanocortin receptor MC4; the amino terminal SYS is important for binding at MC3 and MC5 receptors, thus influencing autonomic functions; and the amino terminal KPV sequence may trigger the anti-inflammatory effects at MC1 receptors [56], [57]. Thus, autoAbs binding to different regions of \u03b1-MSH peptide could differentially influence its biological activities.",

The factors triggering such a switch may be related directly to alterations of intestinal microflora, such as special diets, starvation, antibiotic or antifungal treatment, and gastrointestinal infections, or to changes in the mechanisms of antigen presentation to the immune system, including alterations of the intestinal barrier by inflammation or stress [58], and genetic vulnerability in downstream pathways of the immune system leading to autoAb production. In fact, many of these factors have previously been proposed to contribute to the etiology of eating disorders, one example being the association of anorexia nervosa with streptococcal infection [59]. Following this example, we have in this study revealed the existence of sequence homology between Streptococcus and leptin and in a previous study with gonadotropin-releasing hormone [60], presenting a potential link between micro-organisms and immune-mediated regulation of appetite-related peptides. Interestingly, increased levels of autoAbs against gonadotropin-releasing hormone were associated with intestinal pseudo-obstruction [61], suggesting that this link might also be relevant to the regulation of the gut propulsive activity considering important role of several neuropeptides including CRH in gut motor function [62].",
