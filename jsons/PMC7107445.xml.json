            "text": "To provide a more comprehensive view for human mAbs against MERS-CoV, we sought to isolate and identify human mAbs targeting the MERS-CoV S protein. We were interested in determining the germline origin genes of the most potent neutralizing Abs in a recovered patient with natural MERS-CoV infection. Workflow for generation of the human mAbs was shown in Figure 1. Eighty-two B-cell cultures of \u223c2880 wells were positive (2.85%) against the S protein by ELISA, and 11 of 82 B-cell culture wells targeting the MERS-CoV S protein showed the most potent neutralizing activity (inhibition rate [IR], \u226590%) against the MERS-CoV S pseudovirus (Figure 1). The variable regions encoding the heavy and light chains (VH and VL/VK) were amplified from the above 11 exceptionally potent B-cell cultures and cloned into expression vectors (PBR322 based) for sequencing and immunogenetics analysis. To expand the screening of Ab genes, we sequenced and analyzed 110 VH plasmid sequences and found 39 distinct VH sequences originating from 16 germline genes (Figure 2A, Supplementary Table S1). We sequenced and analyzed 220 VL plasmid sequences and found 56 distinct VL lambda and kappa sequences originating from 16 and 9 different germline genes (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table S1), respectively. We noted that the 4 major families of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) germline were IGHV1-69*04/09, IGHV4-34*01/02, IGHV1-46*01, and IGHV3-53*01, with percentages of 18.6%, 16.28%, 11.63%, and 11.63%, respectively. The major family of the immunoglobulin light-chain/kappa-chain variable germline were IGLV1-40*01/02, IGLV2-14*01, IGKV1-39*01, IGKV1-5*03, IGKV2-28*01, and IGKV3-11*01, with percentages of 16.66%, 11.90%, 21.43%, 14.29%, 14.29%, and 14.29%, respectively. Among neutralizing active mAbs, the VH1-69 gene usage was dominated in the heavy chains, whereas the V1-40 and V1-39 genes of the lambda and kappa chains were used with the highest frequencies in the light chains of the human IgG repertoire (Figure 2A).",

Eleven of 13 mAbs displayed strong neutralizing activity against the MERS-CoV pseudovirus (IC50 value, <0.05 \u03bcg/mL), whereas one (Ab39-2) showed a weak neutralizing activity against the MERS-CoV pseudovirus (IC50 value, >0.1 \u03bcg/mL). The Abs Ab27 and Ab33-2 (named MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33, respectively) demonstrated the most potent neutralizing activities, with IC50 values of 0.0010 and 0.0013 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, against the MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Some mAbs shared the same VH genes, but their neutralizing activity was rather different. For example, Ab39-1 and Ab39-2 were derived from the same well, and the VH germline gene (H39-9) showed various levels of neutralizing activity when paired with different VLs.",

As shown in Figure 5D, a constant ratio between MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 was set by their respective IC50 concentrations, as determined above in Figure 3B and C. Dose-dependent neutralization activity for MERS-GD27, MERS-GD33, or the combination was then evaluated by serial 3-fold dilutions in concentrations from 81 times of the IC50 to 1/81 of the IC50.

Percentage of neutralization for combination was approximately 0.499-fold and 6.05-fold reduction in IC50 compared with that for MERS-GD27 or MERS-GD33 alone.

As previously defined, the MERS-CoV RBD has two subdomains: the core subdomain comprising a 5-stranded antiparallel sheet (\u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, \u03b24, and \u03b29) and the receptor-binding subdomain comprising a 4-stranded antiparallel sheet (\u03b25, \u03b26, \u03b27, and \u03b28) located between the \u03b24 and \u03b27 of the core subdomain. The MERS-GD27 binds the receptor-binding subdomain (Figure 6A), using a total of 20 residues from the 3 heavy-chain complementarity determining region (HCDR) loops and light-chain complementarity determining region (LCDR)1 to interact with 16 residues from the \u03b25 strand, \u03b25-\u03b26 loop, \u03b26-\u03b27 loop, \u03b27 strand, and \u03b27-\u03b28 loop of the receptor-binding subdomain (Supplementary Table S4). The buried surface contributed by the heavy chain at the interface was approximately 770 \u00c52, which was much larger than the approximately 100 \u00c52 buried surface by the light chain. The core at the binding interface was formed by the RBD \u03b27 strand and the 3 HCDR loops (Figure 6A), in which RBD Tyr540 interacted with Ab Ser34 and Tyr112, and RBD Arg542 interacts with Ab Ser34, Ser103, Gly104, and Tyr106. Around the binding core, RBD Glu536 and Asp539 formed hydrogen-bonding interactions with Ab light chain Tyr36 and heavy chain Ser109, respectively (Figure 6B).",

Of the 11 mAbs displaying strong neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV, 2 of the mAbs with an IGHV1-69-encoded heavy chain (MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33) that bound different epitopes on the S protein showed the most potency and largest range of neutralizing activity against the MERS-CoV in vitro. Furthermore, we identified the structural basic of MERS-GD27 neutralization and recognition by crystallographic analysis, which revealed that its epitope almost completely overlapped with the receptor-binding site.",

            "text": "Compared with the previous reports of human mAbs targeting the MERS-CoV S protein (Table 1), our results showed a high diversity in the germline origin genes of mAbs in a recovered patient with a natural MERS-CoV infection; these covered all the VH germline genes except for two mAbs (MERS-27 was from the scFv-yeast display library and 4C2 was from immune mice). We also found that several VH germline genes were never reported in previous human mAbs against MERS-CoV. It is notable that various genetically distinct germline-encoded neutralizing mAbs existed in the MERS-CoV-recovered patient\u2019s immune repertoires. Another noticeable feature of our MERS-CoV natural infection-derived immune repertoires was the high frequency of IGHV1-69 allele usage, which suggested that this germline gene was a common precursor of MERS-CoV Abs and might recognize similar epitopes. The IGHV1-69 gene was also preferentially used by other antiviral Abs, including Abs against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 [33], influenza virus [34], and hepatitis C virus [35]. Accordingly, the VH genes of 13 mAbs originated from the VH1-69*04/09 with low SHM, suggesting that the clones arose from naive B cells, and each of them paired with the lambda (VL1-40*01/02, VL1-50*01, VL1-51*01, and VL2-14*01) and kappa (VK2-28*01) genes, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The germline nature of these Abs implied that Abs could be elicited relatively fast because of the low number of SHM required for affinity maturation. This was in contrast to some Abs against HIV-1 and likely other chronic infections that could be highly divergent from their putative germline predecessors, and they may require extensive and complex affinity maturation pathways to obtain breadth and potency [36, 37].",

Natural variation in F506 had been reported for England-1 MERS-CoV, which was isolated from the second MERS patient from Qatar [40]. Given viral infection and neutralization escape, we termed \u201cdivergent combination immunotherapy\u201d [41] and suggested investigating the cooperation of the more potent neutralizing mAbs with the cross-neutralized protective mAbs. Our results indicated that 13 mAbs present diverse binding phenotypes of competing ability with MERS-GD27 or MERS-GD33, which suggests divergent epitopes. Mutagenesis analysis suggested that MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 recognized distinct regions in S glycoproteins, but more work would be required for the fine mapping of epitopes in the future. The epitope mapping of MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 could also be helpful for identifying residues critical for neutralization and for investigating virus evolution under immune pressure, which was a force selecting for virus mutation. In addition, synergistic effect was also found when MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 were used in combination for neutralization against pseudotyped MERS-CoV, providing a theoretical basis for the combined use in animal and clinical testing in the future.",

Previously determined complex structures included the RBD bound by Abs m336, MCA1, MERS-27, 4C2, and D12, respectively. Structural comparisons of them with the MERS-GD27/RBD complex structure showed 2 major orientations of the Ab when binding the RBD (Supplementary Figure S3). Antibodies m336, MCA1, and MERS-GD27 adopted the first orientation by having a large amount of steric clashes with the DPP4 receptor in the structural superimposition (Supplementary Figure S3A\u2013C), whereas the other Abs MERS-27, 4C2, and D12 tilted from the first orientation and had much less steric clashes with the DPP4 receptor (Supplementary Figure S3D\u2013F). MERS-GD27 and m336 had the largest overlap in their epitopes with DPP4 (Supplementary Figure S3C), and the pseudovirus IC50 values for m336 (0.003 \u03bcg/mL) [10, 11] and MERS-GD27 (0.001 \u03bcg/mL) were lower than those of MERS-27 (63.96 nM) [15], 4C2 (0.71 \u03bcg/mL) [18], MCA1 (0.39 \u03bcg/mL) [20], and D12 (0.013 \u03bcg/mL) [42].
