Since they were not cured by conventional immunosuppressive, they all met the creation for refractory JDM. Till now, it is very difficult to treat refractory JDM. Many researchers have contributed to find out new treatment. In 2011, Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO) studied 145 patients with recent-onset JDM and 130 patients with one disease flare. It found out that cyclosporine and IVIG were preferred for treating relapse in Europe [12]. In 2012, the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) put forward three consensus protocols, including steroids, methotrexate and IVIG, in order to optimize the baseline standard therapy for patients with moderate to severe JDM [13]. However, those medications have unavoidable toxic side effects, such as weight gain, growth delay, gonadoinhibitory and so on. Therefore, we would like to find out a new way to cure refractory JDM, based on its possible pathogenesis. Although the aetiology of JDM remains unclear, current theories propose a combination of environmental triggers, immune dysfunction and specific tissue responses as possible causes [14]. Many literatures point out that JDM is a true inflammatory small vessel vasculitis, and cytokines, such as interferons and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, play an important role in the pathogenesis [1, 15]. Besides, literatures showed AHSCT was safe for children [7, 16]. Therefore, we thought that autologous HSCT might be effective and safe for refractory JDM.",

All of our three patients had tried conventional medicatons for 6 to 31 months before HSCT, but none of them used biologics. During 2005\u20132008, biologics was rarely used in China, and its efficacy in dermatomyositis is not confirmed [15].Therefore, our three patients did not try biologics. [4\u20136, 17\u201321]. After AHSCT, 13 cases had improved (13/14), and only one case (1/14) did not. There was no death. Therefore, we and articles verified together that AHSCT was an effective and safe way to treat refractory DM/PM patients.",

However, CTX and ATG were included in almost all regiments. For our three cases, we used CTX, ATG and melphalan as the conditioning regimen, because my first patient (patient 1) received AHSCT in 2005. At that time, no successful case was reported about JDM treated by HSCT. Since our patient responded poorly to immunosuppressants, we gave him an intensive conditioning. All of our three patients were successfully transplanted and improved. After AHSCT, patient 1 and patient 3 developed virus infection, but no other complication or death. According to articles (Table 1), reported complications include three virus infection (3/11), one mycobacterium avium infection (1/11), one acute respiratory distress syndrome (1/11), one ATG allergy (1/11) and one mucositis (1/11). 5 out of 10 patients had no complication after transplantation. No death was reported (0/14). Therefore, we concluded that AHSCT would be a safe treatment for DM/PM.",
