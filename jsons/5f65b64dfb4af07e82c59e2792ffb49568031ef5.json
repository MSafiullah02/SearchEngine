Following hospital admission on February 6 th , 2020, he was diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia (RNA nucleic acid testing, NAT). The patient did not have records of a past medical history available, however he reported a history of heart failure. There was no history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, cerebral infarction, acute coronary syndrome, tumour, kidney, or liver disease. There was no history of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 128/74 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, a temperature of 38\u00b0C and normal oxygen saturation (97%). Upon lung auscultation, decreased breath sounds and crackles were noted. Course in hospital: The patient continued to be febrile and to experience dyspnea but did not require ventilation. Given the CT, BNP, and symptoms, a cardiac ultrasound was conducted on February 14 th , 2020 to rapidly assess left ventricular function, in a bedside, targeted assessment to help guide further management and testing. Right ventricular size and function were normal. The aortic valve appeared structurally normal, however significant aortic regurgitation was noted by color Doppler. The aortic regurgitation was thought to be severe by visual assessment but not fully quantified given the limits of the 'quick-look' cardiac ultrasound scan Management: Heart failure treatment was initiated with beta-blockers and diuretics. Over the course of the next 4 days the patient's symptoms improved and BNP levels decreased markedly.",

In some settings, such as in North America, such a bedside, quick-look scan would be described as a cardiac POCUS. Cardiac POCUS to provide binary information, can be achieved with limited training, often conducted with highly portable (hand held or mobile) devices and can be performed by non-cardiologists. In this case, full chamber and valvular function was not quantified by POCUS and was not required immediately, thereby limiting operator and/or sonographer exposure while impacting management. Comprehensive TTE evaluation of the degree of aortic regurgitation, if clinically warranted, could be attained at a later date, or in a targeted manner if the clinical status changes.",

The decision to conduct cardiac ultrasound was based upon the finding of symptoms and an elevated BNP value, known to be generally associated with an unfavourable course in heart failure and pneumonia. However, not all patients with an elevation in BNP may require evaluation or treatment for heart failure. In this case, the patient continued to be symptomatic and the cardiac POCUS affected management by suggesting the need for heart failure therapies. It is likely that the aortic regurgitation and dilated cardiomyopathy were underlying conditions, however etiology could not be confirmed by this technique. Due to the severe shortage of medical resources during the pandemic, only one cardiac ultrasound was conducted during the hospital stay to answer a targeted clinical question. Thus the aetiology of the aortic regurgitation was not fully determined but deferred for examination by comprehensive TTE at a later time following resolution of the pandemic.",

In the case presented, left ventricular dysfunction was segmental. Thus in addition to fulminant myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction triggered by the infection may have been a possible underlying mechanism -either due to plaque rupture, or segmental injury from supplydemand mismatch. It has recently been proposed that Stage III or the extrapulmonary stage of COVID-19 infection represents a host inflammatory response during which multi-organ dysfunction may ensue. 6 Typically this stage may be characterized ARDS, shock, and cardiac failure. This stage is associated with elevation of inflammatory markers, troponin, and BNP. Further investigation is required to delineate the mechanisms of disease at this stage. Personnel and Equipment: All scans were conducted by trained individuals who were either caring for the patient or, who then provided their findings immediately to the treating physician directly in the COVID-19 isolation unit. Simultaneously, images were stored in the ultrasound machine. At the end of the day, following inspection and cleaning, images were copied to hard disk and saved in DICOM or JPG for later viewing. A variety of hand-held, portable, and full-service machines were used. All devices were dedicated to the COVID-19 unit and did not leave that unit. After each scan, device probes were cleaned with hydrogen peroxide disposable wipes. After each day of scanning, the entire device/machine was stored in a dedicated room for UV disinfection and air disinfection. Once a machine entered the COVID-19 ward, it remained in that ward and was not shared with any other parts of the hospital.",

            "text": "Cardiac Ultrasound: The limited TTE showed that the right ventricle was severely enlarged with severe impairment of function. The right atrium was mildly enlarged. There was moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension was present, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was estimated at 74 mmHg, assuming an elevated right atrial pressure (the inferior vena cava was >21 mm and collapsed less than 50%). Normal left ventricular size and systolic function was quantified (Figure 2, Supplemental Videos 2A, 2B, 2C).Management: Ultrasound of the right lower extremity was conducted, revealing a hypoechoic region in the posterior tibial vein confirmed as a filling defect by color Doppler. In combination with the limited TTE results, the patient was diagnosed with an acute pulmonary embolism in context of a deep vein thrombosis and urgently managed as per the standard heparinization protocol, however the patient continued to deteriorate, and succumbed to his illness.Teaching Point 1 -Application and Setting:In this case limited TTE, in an intensive care unit setting, allowed visualization of the right ventricle, which is traditionally difficult to image. A highly skilled operator was able to visualize theright ventricle through modified views and obtain the highest tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity, required for estimation of the PASP. Depending upon the setting, such a skilled acquisition may be obtained by an echocardiographer (as occurs in China) or by sonographer, typical for a North American setting. Along with performing maneuvers (sniff) to document inferior vena cava distensibility, such careful quantification may not be part of the repertoire of most non-cardiology trained POCUS operators. TTE provides high quality imaging, archiving and quality control, along with expert interpretation of the presence of severe pulmonary hypertension required for documentation of this serious condition necessitating treatment (anticoagulation) that can have risks. Teaching Point 2-Patient Impact: This patient suffering from viral pneumonia experienced acute pulmonary embolism in context of deep vein thrombosis. The limited TTE differentiated between a right versus left sided heart lesion leading to hemodynamic deterioration and symptoms observed. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated based upon the results of this test alone thus high confidence in the presumed diagnosis was required. It is important to note that TTE is not typically the accepted approach for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism but provides indirect evidence. However when confining patients to a COVID-19 infection isolation ward, the logistics of performing computed tomography (CT), were felt to be challenging and too low yield given the disadvantages of patient transport including: personnel needed for transport, associated use of PPE, and postprocedure cleaning required (several hours of cleaning the CT after scanning of a COVID-19 infected patient). Finally we note that the PASP was severely elevated raising the possibility that beyond the diagnosis of acute PE, differential diagnosis included the possibility of underlying pulmonary hypertension or recurrent pulmonary embolic disease. Teaching Point 3-Global Context: At this time a prothrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 infection has been suggested but remains to be established. Preliminary analysis of our cohort during this pandemic has shown that in COVID-19 infection, patients with deep vein thrombosis were sicker, bedbound for longer, and had a significantly longer prothrombin time compared with patients that did not have deep vein thrombosis (Zhang L et al, unpublished data). It remains critical to understand and further investigate the direct association between COVID-19 infection and deep vein thrombosis.Case 3 Acute Myocardial InjuryIndication: CCE for Diagnosis of extent of Myocardial Injury, Anticoagulation ManagementA 45-year-old female presented to hospital following 7 days of fever and 1 day of chest pain. She had been bed-bound for 3 days. The patient did not have records of a past medical history available, however she reported a history of hypertension. The COVID-19 NAT was positive and the patient was admitted for viral pneumonia. Physical exam revealed a blood pressure of 111/73 mmHg, heart rate of 118 bpm, a temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, and initially normal oxygen saturation (99%) and did not require invasive ventilation. Lung auscultation revealed coarse breath sounds, and cardiac auscultation was otherwise unremarkable.Initial Evaluation: Laboratory tests revealed a WBC of 11.7 x 10 9 /L, an elevated high sensitivity troponin I value of 9889.4 ng/L (normal <100 ng/L) and a BNP value of 632 pg/ml (normal <100 pg/L). The ECG was non-contributory. The patient did not require invasive ventilation but was admitted to an intensive care setting. Cardiac ultrasound was indicated to evaluate the history of chest pain and significant elevation of troponin in context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A targeted ultrasound was conducted in the critical care unit based upon the patient's medical history, clinical condition, and laboratory findings.",

            "text": "The application of critical care echocardiography by skilled operators in the intensive care unit allows the treating physician to make a clinical determination of an often complex, hemodynamic scenario. The presence of this skill allows for serial assessment by operators that are already present in the unit, without having to expose sonographers or other operators not normally functioning in those units. In this case, the critical care echo provided good visualization of wall motion abnormality -often one of the most challenging skills in echocardiography. Most importantly, the thrombus was clearly visualized in this setting at baseline and with serial study. Teaching Point 2-Patient Impact: In this case echocardiography was conducted because of symptoms and an elevated troponin level. COVID-19 infection may be associated with segmental wall motion abnormalities and the consequent sequelae of aneurysm formation and thrombus. Critical Care Echocardiography played a role in the decision to initiate anticoagulation and provide myocardial protective therapy. It is important to note that, as of yet, there are no clear guidelines for the performance of cardiac ultrasound in the context of troponin elevation. Troponin elevation and chest pain appear common in severe cases of COVID-19 infection, however this may not always necessitate cardiac ultrasound. Finally, in this particular case, it was difficult to discern whether there was a new wall motion abnormality or whether the thrombus was present previously. Thus the chronicity of the findings is not clear, in part due to the lack of availability of previous medical charting and echocardiography. This represents an important challenge a COVID-19 designated hospital may face in a crisis situation when serving patients referred from a wide geographic region especially if medical records from other facilities are not readily available.",

Scanning Procedures: All personnel wore full PPE when entering the COVID-19 ward to conduct ultrasound (Figure 4). PPE was changed between patients and whenever leaving. Typically focused ultrasound scans were completed in less than 30 minutes but could extend up to an hour. Conducting scans in a fully protected state (wearing protective clothing, double gloving, masks, goggles, face shields) added time. Donning and doffing PPE, cleaning, and planning a targeted exam added time even, though these were focused studies. Some scans were abbreviated to provide only binary information similar to a POCUS.

This case series illustrates the role of ultrasound when there was suspicion of cardiac disease applied in 3 distinct settings: POCUS, limited conventional TTE, and Critical Care Echocardiography. Though the workflow model in a Chinese setting is based upon acquisition by echocardiographers, the indications and protocols can be translated to other settings in which a diverse array of practitioners may apply ultrasound in an identical manner. In each case, given the serious risk and consequences of contagion with COVID-19 infection, cardiac ultrasound was conducted at an inflection point, in light of symptoms or objective abnormal parameters, and when findings directly impacted subsequent management.",
