Circulating levels of YKL\u201040 were increased in patients with asthma, which was correlated with disease severity.9 CHI3L1 variants affected serum YKL\u201040 levels and influenced asthma status and lung function.10 BRP\u201039 was identified as an important regulator of allergic responses and tissue remodeling in mice.11 CHI3L1 has also been linked to other types of chronic lung inflammation 12, 13 and acute lung injury.14 However, the role of CHI3L1 in viral respiratory infection has not been previously investigated.",

To investigate this possibility, we measured YKL\u201040 in human nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from hospitalized children presenting with acute respiratory symptoms, and compared the immune responses induced by RSV in wild\u2010type (WT) and BRP\u201039 knockout (KO) mice. We found that RSV infection induced IL\u201013\u2010dominant immune responses in a murine model and that CHI3L1/BRP\u201039 may enhance airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), inflammatory cell recruitment, and mucus production in RSV\u2010infected mice. Moreover, treatment with anti\u2010CHI3L1 antibody attenuated RSV\u2010induced airway inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in RSV\u2010infected WT mice, suggesting that CHI3L1 is a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of RSV\u2010associated LRTI.",

NPAs were tested by multiplex virus PCR panel including RSV A/B, HRV A/B/C, adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, influenza virus A/B, metapneumovirus. Mycoplasma antibody from serum and bacterial culture from blood and NPA were also evaluated. Children with congenital heart diseases, chronic lung disease associated with prematurity or recurrent infections, or a history of prematurity were excluded. Patients with other respiratory infections detected using a multiplex virus PCR panel or by serological testing were also excluded. About 55 children were ultimately enrolled in the study. And 43 children were belonged to the group of RSV A infection only established from NPA. The control group included 12 patients with mild respiratory symptoms in whom no pathogens were detected. To evaluate the severity of respiratory illness, respiratory symptoms were scored at the time of admission.16 YKL\u201040 and IL\u201013 levels in NPA were measured using enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).",

When we compared cell recruitment to the lungs after RSV infection, increased numbers of CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and eosinophils were seen in WT but not in BRP\u201039 KO mice (Figure 4A\u2010C). RSV infection caused significant increases in Th2 cytokine mRNA levels in the lungs of WT mice; the IL\u20104 and IL\u20105 levels were increased 1.3 and 2.0 folds as compared to levels in the WT PBS group. Additionally, lung IL\u201013 mRNA expression was strikingly increased 6.2 folds in WT RSV\u2010infected mice. In contrast, Th2 cytokine mRNA levels were not significantly altered by infection in BRP\u201039 KO mice (Figure 4D\u2010F). Unlike the other Th2 cytokines, IL\u201013 level in BALF was increased in WT mice upon RSV infection, but was undetectable in BRP\u201039 KO mice (Figure 4G). We also observed an increase in the numbers of IL\u201013\u2010expressing CD4+ T cells in WT but not BRP\u201039 KO mice infected with RSV (Figure 4H). As in the case of other inflammatory cytokines, RSV infection caused an upregulation of IFN\u2010\u03b3 levels in both WT and BRP\u201039 KO mice (Figure 4I), whereas MCP\u20101, IL\u201010, and IL\u20106 levels were not changed in both groups (data not shown).

In addition, the expression of IL\u201013R\u03b12\u2014a receptor for CHI3L1 during effector responses27 was not investigated. Further studies examining innate immune responses (eg, epithelium\u2010derived cytokines or ILC2s) during the early phases of RSV infection in BRP\u201039 null mice, as well as IL\u201013R\u03b12 expression and regulation in RSV infection are needed for a better understanding of the relationship between BRP\u201039 and RSV infection. A neonatal model of RSV infection in BRP\u201039 null mice may also be useful for investigating the role of BRP\u201039 in asthma development, which would be consistent with the role of early\u2010life viral bronchiolitis in asthma inception.",

Using BRP\u201039 KO mice, we demonstrated that BRP\u201039 is an important regulator of RSV\u2010induced airway inflammation. RSV infection induced the upregulation of BRP\u201039 produced by macrophages and epithelial cells at sites of Th2 inflammation. BRP\u201039 deficiency attenuated weight loss, AHR, and Th2 (IL\u201013) responses as well as increase of DCs and M2 macrophage activation. Additionally, RSV\u2010induced airway inflammation and IL\u201013 production were decreased by anti\u2010CHI3L1 antibody treatment. These data suggest that BRP\u201039 plays an important role in RSV\u2010induced airway inflammation and that its neutralization is a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of RSV\u2010related LRTI.",
