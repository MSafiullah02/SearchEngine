Especially, cell damage by shear stress and aeration has to be considered. Therefore this chapter starts with a detailed discussion of shear stress effects on mammalian cells (anchoragedependent and suspendable cells) in model systems and bioreactors, respectively, and consequences for reactor design. Appropriate oxygen supply is another critical issue, as adapted oxygen supply systems are required. Techniques for immobilization of cells, either grown on microcarriers in suspension culture or within macroporous carriers in fixed bed or fluidized bed reactors, are discussed as well. With respect to the operation of bioreactors, the characteristics of different culture modes (batch, fed-batch, chemostat, perfusion) are introduced and practical examples are given. Finally, concepts for monitoring of bioreactors, including offline and online methods as well as control loops (e.g. O 2 , pH), are considered.",

In conventional bioreactor systems, aerated stirred tanks and bubble columns, adherent cells grown on microcarriers or suspended cells are exposed to variously intense hydrodynamic forces. A sufficiently intense force will destroy the cell wall. Forces of lesser magnitude may induce various physical responses, including reduced growth, cell death (apoptosis) or other metabolic reactions.

Afterwards, the medium flows with a defined velocity through the chamber for a certain time and the cell morphology, the number of viable cells and the concentration of substances that are released by the damaged cells [i.e. lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] are evaluated .

From this point of view the mechanical strength of the cell, expressed by the bursting membrane tension, could be an appropriate parameter to describe the allowed level of stress.

The interaction between cells and bubbles was strongly influenced by the concentration of protecting agents (e.g. Pluronic F68, see below) and the retention time of the bubbles in the medium. Based on his phenomenological observations he suggested subdividing the way of a bubble from the sparger to the surface into four zones (Fig. 4.6 ). Cells getting in contact with a bubble directly after bubble formation are damaged instantly, mainly due to a difference in surface tension (zone 1). After longer retention of the bubble in the medium, several medium compounds, especially high molecular weight compounds or proteins, are adsorbed at the surface of the bubble, and the surface tension is reduced. Thus the cells are not damaged any more, but are still attached at the surface and therefore float with the rising bubble (zone 2). In zone 3, attachments of cells at the surface is further reduced. In zone 4 the gas bubbles burst at the surface of the fluid and form a foam layer. Cells can be damaged either during bubble collapse or when trapped in the foam (Fig. 4.7) . When a bubble collapses at the surface, cells adsorbed to the bubble surface or trapped in the wake of the bubble are exposed to relatively high shear forces. These forces are strong enough to rupture the cell's membrane. The shear forces can originate from the velocity gradient arising from the upward movement of the bubbles and the downward jet resulting from the bursting bubbles. Cells entrapped in the foam layer are exposed to shear by the movement of the bubbles surrounding a cell in different directions and nutritional effects (e.g. oxygen limitation). Meanwhile it is generally accepted that these effects are mainly responsible for cell damage in aerated systems. Some general statements can be made regarding bubble-associated damage (Chisti 2000) :",

Cells grown on microcarriers experience more severe hydrodynamic forces than do freely suspended cells (for review see Chisti 2001) .

For example, if standard stirred tank reactors (D R = 3d R ) are scaled up to a geometrically similar larger vessel, the ISF depends solely on the rotational speed of the impeller (ISF = \u03c0n R ). Therefore the rotational speed would be independent of scale and the impeller tip speed d R n R would therefore increase with scale. In general it is doubtful whether concepts based on the stirrer speed are appropriate for scale-up of cell damage. Instead, between cell damage and volume specific power input was proposed. This will be discussed in detail in the following sections.",

The protective effect can be physical and/or physiological (biochemical) depending on the specific agent. The protective effect of serum increases with increasing serum concentration up to 10% v/v serum and seems to be physical and physiological. The physical protective effect can be attributed to reduced plasma-membrane fluidity, increased medium viscosity or a turbulence-dampening effect. The precise nature is not yet clear. Physiological effects seem to take longer to become effective, meaning that a prolonged exposure of cells to serum will reduce their shear sensitivity. In addition to whole serum, serum compounds such as serum albumin also protect cells (e.g. bovine serum albumin (BSA) at >0.4 g L \u22121 ).

Therefore several scale-up steps from the laboratory to the industrial scale are required and the design criteria have to be evaluated at each step. Furthermore it is not taken into account, that due to an uneven distribution of energy dissipation within a stirred vessel suspended cells or cells grown on microcarriers are exposed to varying levels of shear stress on their way through the vessel. The maximal energy dissipation can differ significantly from the mean energy dissipation, depending on the geometry of the vessel and the stirrer. Additional frequency of exposure to the maximal energy dissipation has to be considered. Henzler and Kauling (1993) have shown some important scale-up relationships ( Fig. 4.13) . The mechanical stress produced by the liquid increases with the size of the reactor, even if the mean energy dissipation (power input per volume) remains constant. In contrast, the shear produced by the bubbles decreases simultaneously. If the size of the reactor is increased by a factor of 1,000 (from 1 to 1,000 L) the main shear due to aeration decreases by a factor of 10. As cell damage seems to be caused mainly by sparging, this is a very important indication. It suggests that cell damage due to shear stress observed on the laboratory scale is of minor importance in larger reactors. This seems to be one reason why sparging of bioreactors is often regarded as problematic on a laboratory scale, whereas on a large scale it continues to be the preferred and robust method for supplying oxygen to the cell culture. draw some conclusions from research concerned with shear stress on mammalian cells:",

Because oxygen is only slightly soluble in medium (approximately 7 mg L \u22121 ) and the oxygen consumption rate (or oxygen uptake rate OUR) is between 3 \u00d7 10 -10 and 2 \u00d7 10 -8 mg cell \u22121 h \u22121 (Aunins and Henzler 1993) , a typical culture of 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells mL \u22121 would deplete the oxygen dissolved in the medium in under one hour and run out of oxygen rapidly. Therefore it is clearly necessary to supply oxygen during the culture period. Some methods used for this purpose on a small scale are surface aeration, membrane aeration, gas sparging and increase of the partial pressure of oxygen in the headspace or the supplied air (Aunins and Henzler 1993) . The scale-up of animal cell cultures is greatly dependent upon the ability to supply sufficient oxygen without causing cell damage. Because of high mass transfer rates and operational simplicity, gas sparging is the preferred method in large scale cell culture. However, cultured animal cells may be damaged by gas sparging (Handa et al. 1987; Kunas and Papoutsakis 1990; Michaels et al. 1996; Zhang et al. 1992a) . Cell bubble interactions are generally regarded as the likely cause of this cell damage but the mechanism is not fully understood (Sect. 4.1.3.3) (Chisti 2000; Meier et al. 1999; Wu 1995) . It is hypothesized that shear associated with bubble rupture on the bubble surface is the main cause. The supply of oxygen in the cultivation of animal cells in bioreactors still poses a problem. Even though oxygen consumption rates of animal cell cultures are low compared to cultures of other microorganisms, they must be supplied with a sufficient amount of oxygen. But animal cells are more sensitive to shear stress caused by vigorous mixing and gas sparging. This necessitates a maximum possible oxygen transfer into the liquid phase to keep the mechanical force low (Kunas and Papoutsakis 1990; Fenge et al. 1993; Papoutsakis 1991) . In bubble aerated reactor systems, damage to animal cells often occurs due to a wide range of bubble size distribution (Kunas and Papoutsakis 1990; Fenge et al. 1993) . It occurs when ascending bubbles force the cells in the medium to the surface (Grima et al. 1997) . The stress to the cells is caused by the displosion of bubbles breaking through the surface, resulting in permanent damage (Kunas and Papoutsakis 1990; Papoutsakis 1991) .",

Another disadvantage of bubble aeration is that foam could be generated on the surface of the medium, which then could lead to a pushout of the medium out of the bioreactor. But there are several methods available to fight foam production within the vessel (Tan et al. 1994; Zhang et al. 1993) . Widely used are silicone based antifoaming agents. The most significant advantage of bubble aeration is its high oxygen mass transfer into water. This high rate is due to a high volume-specific phase surface area and a lower transport resistance compared to membrane procedures.",

In consequence, membrane aeration systems are mostly used in the laboratory and pilot scales (Marks 2003; Henzler and Kauling 1993) .

With increase of the inner volume, oxygen transfer progressively becomes more difficult, because the mass transfer efficiency of stirred tank reactors generally decreases as the scale is increased (Marks 2003; Henzler and Kauling 1993) . Even though all other aeration methods are technically more complex and lead to less reliability due to the greater number of connection tubes, direct sparging is still the method of choice for the pilot and production scale (Henzler and Kauling 1993; Krahe 2003) . Three different shear hypotheses were considered by Henzler and Kauling (1993) , who also showed a relation for scale up (Sect. 4.1.3.4). The shear ratio related to increasing volume of the reactor from 1 L to 1 m 3 was calculated and a tenfold decrease of the main shear was found. This finding indicated that shear problems due to bubble aeration observed in the laboratory scale are of minor importance in larger bioreactors . In recent studies it has been shown that the bubble size has a significant influence on cell damage (Meier et al. 1999) . The bigger the cell size the higher the relative speed between the gas bubble and the cell. Three possible causes of cell death are associated with bursting bubbles: bursting bubbles may destroy nearby cells within the suspension due to a shear associated with the burst; cells which are trapped inside a bubble may be damaged by the burst, and a bursting bubble may also damage cells which attached to the bubble during its ascent. The relative effect of each of these is a result of the bubble size and medium properties (Meier et al. 1999; Marks 2003) .",

Once a foam bubble collapses, the high surface tension results in a destruction of the cell membrane (Ghebeh et al. 2002) . Experiments performed by Kunas and Papoutsakis in completely filled bioreactors with microbubbles of sizes between 50 and 300 \u00b5m in diameter showed that the cultured hybridomas sustained only very little damage, even when small bubbles were present (Kunas and Papoutsakis 1990). Microbubbles have less relative speed in the fluid, less collision chance and damage ability, due to their higher mean residence time. It was shown by Michaels et al. that it is possible to minimize the frequency of bubble coalescence and breakup events by employing microbubbles for oxygenation at low agitation rates for mixing (Michaels et al. 1996) .",

To increase the mass transfer by increasing the effective phase interface, a second impeller should be located at the interface or near the liquid interface ( Fig. 4 .17). Alternatively an intensive wave motion could be inserted (wave bioreactor) (Singh 1999; Sect. 5.1.4) . The partially submerged second impeller (surface aerator) was seen to increase the mass transfer coefficient four times for laboratory scale stirred reactors (Hu et al. 1986 ). Because bubble introduction should be avoided, oxygen input cannot be increased indefinitely by surface aeration. Henzler and Kauling (1993) gave correlations in the low power input range based on experimental data for the volumetric mass transfer coefficient k L a, the limiting speed of the impeller located at the interface and for the scale-up. with H R : filling height of the stirred reactor -impeller located at the interface (m) D R : reactor diameter (m) d R : impeller diameter (m) n R : impeller speed (s \u22121 ) g: acceleration due to gravity (m 2 s \u22121 ) and 15 Henzler and Kauling (1993) show that even for semi-industrial scale, sufficient oxygenation of cell cultures cannot be provided by the surface of the liquid. Therefore surface aeration is sufficient only for low density cultures in small vessels like T-flasks, roller bottles and bench scale vessels, where a relatively large ratio of air-medium interface to volume exists.",

With increasing gas velocity the aeration efficiency (k L a/v) decreases as a result of increasing coalescence, so it makes sense to use oxygenenriched air to minimize shear due to gas bubbles (Henzler and Kauling 1993). Using special ceramic micro-spargers or increasing gas velocities gives a uniform distribution of the gas over all the sparger holes/pores and a more homogenous bubble size distribution (Figs. 4.18 and 4.19) . This leads to reduced coalescence because of the decrease in the local gas hold-up (Henzler and Kauling 1993). Henzler and Kauling (1993) showed that the mass transfer is hindered in proteincontaining media by the presence of protein at the interface, especially for smaller bubbles, because of the increased foam formation tendency of protein-containing media and a resulting increase in coalescence of bubbles.",

The high k L a-values of the ceramic microsparger aeration system clearly show that a significantly better oxygen transfer into the medium was achieved by the larger phase surface area and in addition by the fact that the gas bubbles remained longer in the bioreactor (Nehring et al. 2004 ). The culture of cells on microcarriers in sparged reactors requires low gas flow rates, small bubble diameter for high oxygen transfer rates, low mechanical agitation and the use of antifoams to avoid shear stress to the anchorage dependent cells and to avoid flotation of the carriers (Doyle and Griffith 1998). By using a ceramic microsparger system, five times higher k L a values (two microspargers integrated into the baffles) in comparison to stainless steel microspargers (Applikon Biotechnology) were shown for a microcarrier culture (3 g L \u22121 Cytodex 3 microcarrier; DMEM medium) in a 75 L stirred reactor (H/D = 1.5; 2 propeller stirrers with different diameter; 33 rpm) at a very low aeration rate of 0.001 vvm (Czermak and Nehring 2000) .",

Surface aeration is not sufficient for high density cultures. Membrane aeration as a better method for oxygen delivery at high density cultures can be used inside or outside of the bioreactor, in the form of a basket or gas exchanger, respectively. The mass transfer in membrane aeration depends on the length of tubing per reactor volume. Handling membrane aeration systems increases by reactor size and is not manageable for high density systems larger than to 200 L. Membrane aeration using silicone tubing can provide enough oxygen to support 5 \u00d7 10 7 cells mL \u22121 (Fig. 4.26 ). In cultures aerated by spargers, higher mass transfer rates and thus higher cell densities can be achieved. Cell lysis and foaming limit the sparging rates to about 0.1 vvm (Ozturk 1996) . Selection of a good sparger is important for minimizing the foaming and maximizing the mass transfer rates (Fenge et al. 1993; Nehring et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 1992a,b) . The use of micro spargers (such as sintered metal or ceramic), provides more mass transfer area and therefore higher k L a. Micro bubbles can increase the foaming problems by producing more dense foam (Fig. 4.27) .",

Though the mass transfer coefficients are lower for macro spargers, and higher gas flow rates should be used to achieve the same cell density as micro spargers. However, Henzler and Kauling Ozturk (1996) with kind permission of Springer Science and Business Media) (1993) showed that if the size of the reactor is increased, e.g., from V = 1 L to V = 1,000 L, the main shear due to the aeration decreases by a factor of 10. They suggest that problems observed on lab scale with sparger aeration are of minor importance in larger reactors; thus in many cases sparger aeration can be used for oxygenation even in production processes with animal cells. Nehring et al. (2004) compared a microsparging aeration system made of porous ceramic with bubblefree membrane aeration in the cultivation of MDCK cells and in the cultivation of virus infected MDCK cells (2, 5, 30 and 100 L reactor scale). They achieved similar results for cell densities. Antifoaming agents such as Pluronic F-68 and lowering gassing rates and agitation speed (possible when using micro sparger systems) can decrease the problems related to sparging, such as foaming and cell damage (Aunins and Henzler 1993; Nehring et al. 2004; Ozturk 1996; Ma et al. 2004; Dey et al. 1997) . However, the introduction of such additives decreases mass transfer and results in problems in the downstream processing (Aunins and Henzler 1993) . ",

The solute species of CO 2 in the form of CO 2 , HCO 3 \u2212 , H 2 CO 3 or CO 3 2\u2212 , and therefore the variation of CO 2 concentrations, influences the pH of the medium when using sodium bicarbonate as the pH buffer. In addition CO 2 is a potentially inhibitory byproduct in cell cultures. So CO 2 accumulation and excessive removal should be avoided (Ma et al. 2006; Ozturk 1996) . Aeration removes CO 2 from the system and leads to a more complex gas exchange with respect to the balance between O 2 addition and CO 2 removal. The partial pressure of metabolically produced carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) and hence mass transfer of carbon dioxide from solution to the gas bubbles is important in animal cell culture. A rise in pCO 2 can cause a rise in H 2 CO 3 and hence a drop in pH. pCO 2 must therefore be carefully monitored and controlled (Marks 2003; Ma et al. 2006 ). The accumulation of CO 2 depends on the mass transfer characteristics of the aeration system. The mass transfer coefficients for CO 2 and O 2 are not very different when using sparger for aeration and CO 2 accumulation is a minor problem. If a micro sparger system is used for aeration, CO 2 stripping can still be a problem. Small bubbles get saturated by the CO 2 more easily than large bubbles and the efficiency of CO 2 removal decreases. While using membrane aeration, CO 2 accumulation is of greater importance. Depending on the material, the mass transfer coefficients for O 2 and CO 2 can be very different. For silicone tubing the CO 2 mass transfer coefficient is measured to be about four times lower than that of O 2 (Ozturk 1996) . However, a proper pH control is necessary.",

In the early sixties facilities for vaccine production used batteries of roller bottles. Scale-up was possible by increasing the number of roller bottles used. The high labour intensity of this technology is quite obvious. An important breakthrough was the development of the so called \"microcarrier\" by van Wezel (1967) in the beginning of the seventies, a solid particle with a 100-200 \u00b5m structure, on which the cells could grow. As the microcarriers are suspendable in stirred tanks, it became possible to work with large scale suspension reactors (nowadays up to 4,000 L . The great success of this technology led to the development of a large number of different microcarriers for suspension culture and furthermore for different reactor systems, especially for fixed-bed and fluidized-bed reactors .

Larger carriers are used for fluidized and fixed bed reactors due to the higher sedimentation rate. For fluidized bed reactors, carriers having a size of 0.6 to 1 mm are used. For fixed-bed cultures, larger carriers (3-5 mm) are better, to prevent blocking of free channels between the carriers. Obviously larger carriers will have limitations in terms of mass-transfer-effects, especially with respect to oxygen supply, because of the poor solubility of oxygen in the medium and the high uptake rate of the cells.

Different shapes are available, such as fibers, flat discs, woven discs, and cubes, though the sphere is the most common. The surface is usually positively or negatively charged to ensure cell attachment. The density of the electrostatic charge on the surface is critical to allow cell attachment and growth. Non-charged carriers are also available, which are normally coated with collagen or gelatine (denatured collagen) or have fibronectin or fibronectin peptides coupled on the surface.

In the case of microporosity, the pore size is not sufficient to allow cells to grow in the inner parts of the carrier. Micropores are intended to take up larger molecules, up to a molecular weight of approximately 100 kda, to allow the cells to create a micro-environment on the beads and to support cell attachment and growth. A carrier is considered macroporous if the average pore size is between 30 and 400 \u00b5m, allowing for cell growth within the carriers. The porosity of these carriers, defined as the ratio between the volume of the pores and the total carrier volume (as percentage) is normally between 60 and 99%. Macroporous carriers are suitable for immobilizing adherent as well as non-adherent cell lines. Furthermore they allow cells to grow in a three-dimensional, almost tissue-like structure at higher densities compared to solid or microporous carriers. The tissue-like growth stabilizes the cell population, protects against shear stress and decreases the need for external growth factors, so that the use of serum-free or protein-free media becomes easier. As the stability of the culture is improved at high cell density (Sect. 4.4), macroporous carriers are preferably used for long-term continuous culture. Due to the high cell density, the different culture technologies applied for macroporous carriers (stirred tanks for macroporous microcarriers, fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors) are generally run at high perfusion rates. This provides a sufficient nutrient supply as well as removal of toxic metabolites. Furthermore, the residence time of an extracellular product at 37 \u00b0C is reduced and it can quickly be separated from the cells and cooled.",

For most cell lines, more than7 cells per carrier are required during inoculation to ensure that the population of unoccupied microcarriers is <5% and the use of the available surface area is maximized (Butler 2004) . For laboratory scale, it is often recommended to establish a microcarrier culture with 1-3 g (dry weight) of microcarriers per liter with initial cell densities of 1-2 \u00d7 10 5 cells mL \u22121 (might be lower in serum containing medium) and by using a certain start-up strategy (e.g., intermittent stirring to allow for attachment of cells on carriers).

In microcarrier culture usually a serum supplement of 5-10% is added to the medium for general purpose culture, as anchorage-dependent cells require certain adhesion factors contained in serum. For certain types of cell, the concentration of serum supplement can often be reduced.

Basically the microcarrier culture is scaled-up just by adding more microcarriers and more media (Butler 2004) . reported on a 1:1,000 dilution with Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO) that do not attach well to the carriers or that detach easily during mitosis. In this case a 1 L-suspension could inoculate a 1,000 L-reactor.

They should be steam sterilisable, reusable and suitable for adherent and non-adherent cells (reviewed by P\u00f6rtner and Platas 2007; P\u00f6rtner et al. 2007) . A large number of macroporous carriers and support materials for immobilization have been suggested, including glass (natron, borosilicate), cellulose, collagen, synthetic materials, e.g., polypropylene and polyurethane, and ceramic. Most of these carriers proved to be suitable for a large number of cell types (e.g., hybridom, CHO, hepathocytes etc., see Sect. 5.1.2). In some cases (e.g., carriers made of glass or cellulose) coating with gelatine was recommended to support the growth of strictly adherent cells (unpublished data, L\u00fcllau et al. 1994) . The modification of the surface is a critical parameter. Anchoragedependent cells, especially primary or non-established cell lines, have proved to be much more sensitive to the carrier surface than established cell lines (e.g. hybridom, CHO, L293, NIH3 T3). This has to be taken into account during the selection of a suitable carrier for each specific cell line. Examples are shown in Figs. 4.30 and 4.31.

But in the case of fixed reactors, smaller carriers create narrow free channels, which can be blocked by cells growing in these channels. Therefore, diameters of 3-5 mm are an appropriate choice for fixed-bed reactors (P\u00f6rtner and Platas, 2007) .

            "text": "Within macroporous carriers a sufficient supply of immobilised cells with nutrients and removal of inhibiting metabolites are essential. On one hand, oxygen supply has to be addressed, as the solubility of oxygen in culture medium (approx. 0.2 mmol L \u22121 , if the medium is in equilibrium with air) is far lower than the concentration of other nutrients (e.g. glucose 18-25 mmol L \u22121 ). Therefore, the supply of necessary oxygen to immobilised cells is an important criterion for selection of a macroporous carrier. On the other hand, removal of carbon dioxide is also an important aspect, as increased levels of carbon dioxide might reduce the pH to unfavourable conditions. In the following sections, oxygen supply within a macorporous carrier will be addressed to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in masstransfer limitation. Here, only internal effects are considered, and effects due to a boundary layer around the carriers are ignored (Fig. 4.33) . It can be assumed that mass transfer within the carriers is mainly diffusive. Some carriers, especially those having a very high porosity (>90%) can be perfused at an early stage of cultivation. But during the progress of the culture the free pores will be closed by growing cells and extracellular matrix. For a spherical particle the oxygen concentration c O2 within the particle can be described by the following differential equation: with radius r, diffusiv coefficient D e , cell density X, maximal cell specific oxygen uptake rate q o2,max , Monod-constant k o2 , if the cells are distributed homogeneously within the carrier, oxygen can be considered as the limiting substrate, and diffusion can be described by Fick's law. This equation can be solved with the following boundary conditions: for r = 0 \u2192 dc o2 / dt = 0, and r = r P (radius of the particle) \u2192 c o2 (r P ) = c o2,Fl (oxygen concentration in the bulk fluid). The diffusive coefficient is assumed to be D e = 2.56\u00d710 \u22129 m 2 s \u22121 , as suggested by Kurosawa et al. (1989) for oxygen limitation within alginate beads. The cell specific oxygen uptake rate can be described by a Monod-equation. From Miller et al. (1987) and own unpublished data, the Monod-constant k o2 is seen to be approximately 0.001 mmol L \u22121 . As this value is very low compared to the oxygen concentration in the medium, it can be ignored in the first place and oxygen uptake can be regarded as following a zero order reaction. Furthermore the term Xq o2 ,max can be combined and replaced by This equation was solved numerically by a fifth-order Runge-Kutta-method for different values of the oxygen concentration in the fluid and different volumespecific uptake rates. As can be seen from Fig. 4 .34, severe oxygen limitation has to be expected, especially for larger particles (r P = 2 mm) and higher volume-specific uptake rates. These theoretical considerations are supported by NMR studies described by Fassnacht (2001) (Fig. 4.35) and underline the statements made earlier, regarding an appropriate carrier size in fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors.",

Basically, it can be used to protect cells against hazardous environmental conditions. The capsules can be cultivated in suspension reactors similar to microcarriers. Even direct aeration in combination with higher aeration rates, high agitation rates or stirrer speeds can be used without damaging the cells. The fragile nature of the microcapsule is Handling of the cells is simplified, as medium exchange can be easily performed without cell loss. Furthermore, within the capsules, a microenvironment favourable for the cells can develop. Autocrine growth factors can accumulate and in an ideal case the cells switch directly to exponential growth after immobilisation, without a significant lag phase. This is probably the most important aspect. The three basic encapsulation systems available are the bead, the coated bead and the membrane-coated hollow sphere (H\u00fcbner 2007; Murtas et al. 2005; Sielaff et al. 1995) . Typical size for beads made of polysine-alginate is 300-500 \u00b5m, and the molecular weight cut-off of these capsule membranes is 60-70 kDa . The simplest way to encapsulate cells in solid alginate beads is shown in Fig. 4 .38. Immobilization in Ca-alginate beads often leads to problems when the cells release organic acids such as lactate into the medium or when phosphate ions exist as buffering agents in the medium and compete for the binding with the calcium ions. This difficulty led to the development of the coated beads, where additional polyelectrolyte layers, which are also stable in the presence of other ions, are applied to the beads. So the dissolving of the bulb core later on could be done without any problem, and the production of pure polyelectrolyte immobilisates without a solid bead core was a consequent improvement. Fig. 4.38 Encapsulation of non-anchorage dependent, suspendable hybridom cells for production of monoclonal antibodies in calcium alginate encapsulation devices as well as their application have already been described (Huebner and Buchholz 1999) .",

Nevertheless the productivity of batch cultures is limited by the initial concentration of substrates. On one hand, the solubility of certain medium compounds is limited. On the other hand, too high substrate concentrations my induce substrate inhibition or a high cell specific substrate uptake rate leading to increased production of inhibiting metabolites. Furthermore a batch culture runs at a high volume specific productivity only for a short period of time when a high cell concentration is reached and substrates are not yet consumed completely. After harvest the bioreactor has to be cleaned and refurbished before the cycle is repeated (Krahe 2003) . A first step to improve the efficiency of a batch process can be seen in a so-called \"repeated batch\". Here the main part of the cultivation broth is harvested at the end of the exponential growth phase. The remaining part is used as inoculum for the next run. The culture system is filled with fresh medium and the process is newly started. This procedure can be repeated several times.",

Here the culture system is initially filled to one-third or half only and started as a batch. As soon as substrates are consumed or have reached growth limiting values, fresh medium is added, mostly in concentrated form. Cell and product yield can be significantly improved by applying a fed-batch strategy, where nutrients are added after depletion according to an appropriate feeding protocol (P\u00f6rtner et al. 2004 ). The main advantages of a fed-batch compared to a batch are a longer growth phase, higher cell and product concentrations and a higher product yield. On the other hand a larger effort for equipment and control is required. Several control strategies are available for fed-batch culture, which are discussed in detail in Sect. 4.4.4.",

For batch mode the flow rate F = 0 removed. The volume of the culture broth remains constant. The spent medium (harvest) contains all medium compounds including the cells. An alternative to the chemostat is the \"turbidostat\", where the cell concentration is kept constant by controlling the dilution rate. The time course of a chemostat culture is shown in Fig.  4 .39c, the balance equations are given in Table 4 .6. Again cultivation is started as batch. When substrate concentrations are below critical values, feeding of fresh medium and harvest of spent medium are started. After some time all process parameters become constant (average values -steady state), if homogeneous mixing within the culture system can be assumed. During steady state the values for cell concentration, as well as substrate and product (metabolite) concentration, depend on the flow rates for medium supply and harvest, expressed by the dilution rate D (4.42). As shown in Fig. 4 .39d, a constant or increasing cell concentration (depending on the death rate of the cells) can be observed with increasing dilution rate. But when the dilution rate approaches the maximal growth rate of the cells, the cells cannot compensate for wash-out and the cell concentration decreases. At D > D crit (4.47) the cells are washed out of the culture system completely. Substrate concentration is very low at low dilution rates and increases close to the critical dilution rate. The course of the product concentration looks similar to the cell concentration. Chemostat cultures without cell retention are a valuable tool for research (e.g., kinetic studies) (P\u00f6rtner and Sch\u00e4fer 1996; Sect. 2.5), but not for production scale due to low cell and product concentration. Multi-stage chemostat cultures have been suggested to improve the yield of this culture mode (van Lier et al. 1994 ). ",

The specific techniques are discussed in detail in Chap. 5. Similar to a chemostat, here fresh medium is pumped continuously to the culture system and spent medium (harvest) is removed with the same flow rate.

The permeability coefficient depends on the specific compound, the type of membrane and other process parameters (boundary layers on both sides of the membrane, fluid velocity, stirrer speed, etc.). If process parameters are maintained constant, a relationship can be found between the permeability coefficient and the molecular weight of the compound, similar to that between the diffusion coefficient and the molecular weight. Therefore the permeability coefficient decreases with increasing molecular weight (P\u00f6rtner and M\u00e4rkl 1998) . At high values of the molecular weight, the mass transport over the membrane ceases. Usually membranes are characterised by a specific \"cut-off\", meaning that above this molecular weight, no mass transport over the membrane occurs. The basic principle of a dialysis process, as well as the time course of important process parameters, is shown in Fig. 4.39f . The dialysis process can be run as batch, fed-batch or continuously.

Figure 4 .42 shows the relationship between the steady state concentrations for cells, glutamine, glucose, lactate, ammonia and monoclonal antibodies (MAb). Similar data were shown by others for hybridom cells (Miller et al. 1988; Hiller et al. 1991) . As expected, the cell concentration first increases with the increasing dilution rate. The low cell densities at very low dilution rates are mainly due to cell death caused by apoptosis. Later, for dilution rate D approaching the maximal growth rate, the cell concentration decreases and finally becomes zero for D > D crit . A similar course can be found for antibody concentration. Substrate concentrations, especially for glutamine as the limiting substrate in this case, remain at very low values at low dilution rates and increase at dilution rates approaching the maximal growth rate. Ammonia and lactate did not reach limiting concentrations (P\u00f6rtner and Sch\u00e4fer 1996) . In general, the maximal cell and product concentrations obtained in chemostat cultures are quite low and in a similar range as those found in batch culture. Therefore chemostat cultures are a valuable tool for kinetic studies, especially as reliable data at very low substrate concentrations can be obtained. For industrial applications usually cell and product yield are regarded as too low (Griffiths 1992; Werner et al. 1992 ).",

After inoculation, the cells started to proliferate in the fixed-bed, which can be seen in the decreasing glucose and increasing lactate concentrations. A high dilution rate D FB of 10 mL medium per ml fixed-bed per day was used to minimize substrate limitation. A first steady-state was obtained on the fifth day after inoculation at a dissolved oxygen concentration of air saturation at the entry of the fixed-bed. This steady-state was controlled by oxygen limitation, as indicated by the high steady-state glucose concentration and a steady-state glutamine concentration of 2.46 mmol L \u22121 (data not shown). The dissolved oxygen concentration was raised to 300% air saturation on the eighth day. This resulted in an increase of the glucose consumption rate and a new steady-state was reached on the 21st day. The glutamine concentration dropped to 0.52 mmol L \u22121 (data not shown), and the steady-state antibody concentration was 30.7 mg L \u22121 . The low glucose and glutamine concentrations suggest that the steady-state was now controlled by substrate limitation. Therefore, the dilution rate D FB was increased to 20 d \u22121 . This increased the glucose consumption rate significantly, and a new steady-state was obtained with a corresponding non-limiting glutamine concentration of 1.36 mmol L \u22121 and an antibody concentration of 20.2 mg L \u22121 . However, setting the dissolved oxygen concentration to oxygen saturation (477% air saturation) on the 26th day did not result in a further increase of the glucose uptake rate indicating that the system was also not controlled by oxygen limitation and that the maximal possible performance was reached. The oxygen concentration was again reduced to 300% air saturation and the dilution rate to 10 d \u22121 , and the same steadystate was reached on day 46 as on the 21st day, with a glutamine concentration of 0.49 mmol L \u22121 . The shown examples underline the potential of long-term cultivation, especially long-term stability in bioreactor systems with cell retention.",

It also allows for a number of different strategies (batch, fed-batch, continuous) for decoupling the flows of high molecular and low molecular substrates, low molecular metabolites and high molecular products. P\u00f6rtner and coworkers (L\u00fcdemann 1997; P\u00f6rtner et al. 1997; Schwabe et al. 1999; Frahm et al. 2003 ) used a \"nutrient-split\" feeding strategy based on suggestions made by Ogbonna and M\u00e4rkl (1993) . The medium is divided into a buffer solution containing all mineral salts and a medium concentrate containing all relevant substrates (glucose, glutamine, other amino acids, etc.). The medium concentrate can be fed directly to the cells with significantly reduced flow rates, whereas the buffer solution is used as dialysis medium (compare Fig. 4.39f) . Figure 4 .44 shows as continuous dialysis culture run with the above mentioned \"nutrient-split\" -feeding strategy in a membrane-dialysis-bioreactor (data from L\u00fcdemann (1997) ). The bioreactor is discussed more in detail in Sect.. 5.1.1.1. The process was started as batch culture. Continuous perfusion of the cell chamber was switched on at t = 74 h with a perfusion rate of D i = 0.11 d \u22121 . At t = 163 h the perfusion rate was set to D i = 0.145 d \u22121 . For the dialysis chamber perfusion was started at t = 123 h with a perfusion rate D a = 0.163 d \u22121 . The viable cell concentration increased to a maximum value of 1.1\u00d710 7 cells mL \u22121 at t = 140 h and levelled of at 7.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells mL \u22121 .

The main results are summarized in Table 4 .7. As expected, the lowest cell and product concentrations were obtained in batch culture. The low efficiency, expressed by a high medium requirement per mg monoclonal antibody, is mainly due to high cell specific substrate uptake rates during exponential growth. Only the utilization level of the substrates is high, as most of the substrates are consumed totally. For the fedbatch culture cell and product concentration are significantly higher. Due to the applied process strategy to control glutamine at a very low level (Kurokawa et al. 1994 ) the cell specific substrate uptake rates and therefore the medium requirement could be kept low (Sect. 4.4.3) . During chemostat the product concentration was quite low and the medium requirement high, as cell and product concentration are determined by the relationship between cell-specific growth rate and perfusion rate. In perfusion mode, shown here by fixed bed cultivation with cell retention, growth rate and perfusion rate are not coupled. Therefore a significantly higher product yield could be obtained, even if product concentration was similar to chemostat culture and lower compared to fed-batch culture. Furthermore Table 4 .7 shows a significantly higher product concentration and product yield for the dialysis culture due to simultaneous retention of cells and product. The \"nutrient-split\"-feeding strategy further improves the efficiency of this culture mode. Drawbacks of the dialysis technique can be seen in the higher efforts for equipment and process control (P\u00f6rtner and M\u00e4rkl 1998) . The above discussion focuses on data obtained in lab-scale culture systems. Implications on the industrial scale will be addressed in Sect. 4.4.4. ",

In cell culture operations, normally only a few variables are available on-line (e.g., DO, pH, and temperature), and cultivation strategies have to rely on off-line measurements that either have significant time delay or are usually obtained at the end of the cultivation.

Usually the feed rate has to be increased during the process (e.g., using an exponential or linear profile), as the number of cells and consequently the demand for substrate(s) increases. As there is no feedback or re-adjustment during the process, this control strategy cannot react to changes occurring during the actual process with the risk of suboptimal feeding. However, the fixed feed trajectories can be refined, based on the results of the preceding cultivation. Consequently, it allows improvement on a cultivation-to-cultivation basis. This is subject to the condition that any culture conditions influencing nutrient uptake of the cells remain unchanged. On-line characterization is a basic approach describing the metabolism and physiological state of cells. The physiological state of the cells determines the uptake of nutrients and the production of metabolites. Metabolic activity is difficult to measure directly, but respiration and energy conversion rates can be monitored by oxygen mass balance (Eyer et al. 1995; Kyung et al. 1994) or spectroscopic analysis of NAD/NADH + H + (Siano and Muthrasan 1991) . A strategy described by Zhou et al. (1995) and Zhou and Hu (1994) determined the physiological state of the cells on-line during cultivation by the oxygen uptake rate (OUR). This strategy showed a high potential for sustaining optimal growth and reducing the formation of toxic metabolites (ammonia and lactate). Mass spectrometry analysis of exhaust gas was further used to determine OUR (Kyung et al. 1994) .",

Before starting the feeding phase of the cultivation, feed trajectories are calculated on the basis of the kinetic model. This concept can be considered an extension of the pre-defined feed trajectories concept. In both cases, the trajectories are determined before the cultivation but originate in this case from kinetic studies. Furthermore, the intention of the \"a priori\" determination of feed trajectories is to predict the death phase and calculate the feed trajectories accordingly. Fixed feed trajectories cause overfeeding during the death phase. Of course, given stable cell lines and culture conditions, the overfeeding can be reduced by adjusting the fixed feed trajectories before the next cultivation. However, the \"a priori\" determination of feed trajectories allows a more sophisticated control of the death phase in comparison to the fixed feed trajectories. Controlling fed-batch processes with \"a priori\" simulation of process parameters based on a kinetic model (open loop) demands the ability for accurate prediction, especially at low substrate concentrations when the risk of apoptotic cell death is high. The calculation of optimal feed trajectories (Lee et al. 1999; Ryszcuk and Emborg 1997) using kinetic models shows that small deviations between calculated growth and death rates and actual values have a large effect on the reliability of the trajectories. The parameters of the kinetic models, structured or unstructured, are usually derived from previous experiments and thus the trajectories cannot consider actual culture conditions or changes in metabolism. The feed trajectories obtained from simulation might not result in the expected productivity (de Tremblay et al. 1993) .",

            "text": "An overriding goal of the control strategies introduced above was to minimize the production of toxic metabolites such as ammonia and lactate to extend the growth phase. This requires the control of glutamine and glucose at low concentrations so that under these conditions the cell-specific metabolite production is reduced. On the other hand, cell death by apoptosis may be introduced at too low concentrations. Therefore an \"intelligent\" control strategy has to find an optimum between these two extremes. P\u00f6rtner et al. (2004) compared four different fed-batch strategies including fixed feed trajectories, control via oxygen uptake rate OUR (stoichiometric feeding), \"a-priori\" determination of feed trajectories based on a kinetic model and the OLFOcontrol strategy. The intention was not to benchmark the different control strategies on the basis of, e.g., time-space-yield or antibody concentration. Recommendation as to which control strategy should be used for a specific process has to consider the respective process, the desired complexity of the process control and for how long the same cell line will be used. However, the illustration of the different strategies points out the different characteristics of each strategy, thus facilitating the choice. Table 4 .8 summarizes the characteristics of the different feeding strategies. A recommendation based on these findings would favour fixed feed trajectories for an established process with a well-characterized and stable production cell line. An adaptive, model-based control strategy could be the method of choice during cell line development or for rapid production of small amounts of the product for clinical trials, because of its universal character and because it does not require intensive process development. From our experience only very few batch experiments are required to adapt the kinetic model. As the OLFO-controller can detect changes in the cell metabolism during a culture, it can adapt the model parameters and the feed trajectories. Our studies illustrate that the adaptive, model-based OLFO-controller is a valuable tool for the fed-batch control of hybridom cell cultures (Frahm et al. 2002) . Because of its universal character, it can be transferred to different cell lines or adapted to different boundary conditions (e.g., enhanced fed-batch cultivation using dialysis (Frahm et al. 2003) ). More sophisticated optimization criteria, e.g., optimization of final antibody concentration, time-space yield of antibody or another performance measure, can be implemented (Frahm et al. 2005 ).",

            "text": "Until now, batch and fed-batch strategies are being applied quite frequently on industrial scale (Kelly et al. 1993; Otzturk 2006) due to the several reasons discussed already. The drawbacks of discontinuous modes such as large reactor volumes, high maintenance (cleaning, sterilization, etc.) can be overcome to some extent by using a continuous mode, especially perfusion with cell and/or product retention (Table  4 .9). There are a growing number of reports on stable perfusion cultures even on an industrial scale lasting several months (Kompala and Ozturk 2006; Bohmann et al. 1995; Fassnacht et al. 1999; Fussenegger et al. 2000) . The main advantage of perfusion cultures can be seen in the reduced bioreactor size (approximately one-tenth of a suspension reactor without cell retention). Nevertheless there are some difficulties in the perfusion concept. Further equipment such as the retention device itself, pumps for feeding, harvest and medium circulation, and storage tanks for feed and harvest are required. The amount of media needed to complete a moderate to longterm run can be excessively large. A further possible drawback of continuous cultivation is the possibility of variability over the time of the run. Batch or fed-batch cultivations are much shorter in duration and have fewer chances for random occurrences to happen. This is important in dealing with cGMP (current manufacturing practice) conditions that dictate precise reproducibility or evidence of a minimum of non-effects of minor deviations. In the meantime there is a growing number of pharmaceutical products in the market, produced successfully from perfusion systems. Among these are block busters such as Kogenate-FS \u00ae (Bayer Health Care) or Remicade \u00ae (Centocor) (Kompala and Ozturk 2006) . Previous concerns such as getting the processes approved are not longer an issue and it can be expected that due to an increasing pressure on production costs, more perfusion processes will be installed in the future. The process that is becoming more and more important for the production of small quantities of recombinant proteins is transient transfection (Meissner et al. 2001; Derouazi et al. 2004; Baldi et al. 2005) . Non-transfected cells (most commonly HEK-293, COS and BHK cells) are first cultivated usually in batch-mode to a certain cell density and then transfected with DNA encoding for a certain protein.",

A higher variation in temperature often leads to production rates far from the optimum due to slow cell metabolism (temperature below lower limit) or rapid cell death (temperature above higher limit) (Hartnett 1994) . To measure the temperature within the system, resistance temperature devices (RTD) are preferred (PT-100 or PT-1000) due their high accuracy and reproducibility. The device contains a metal conductor which changes resistance with changing temperature. This principle is used to determine the actual temperature within the system. Another method is the application of thermocouples, which are cheaper but also less accurate (Riley 2006; Doyle and Griffith 1998) .",

An optode uses dynamic quenching effects. Therefore pulsed monochromatic light is carried in an optic fiber to the oxygen sensor and excites the immobilized fluorophore (e.g., ruthenium complexes). The excited complex fluoresces and emits energy at a higher wavelength. The collision of an oxygen molecule with a fluorophore in its excited state leads to a non-radiative transfer of energy. This internal conversation decreases the fluorescence signal. The degree of quenching correlates with the oxygen concentration . It is possible to measure either the fluorescence lifetime or the luminescence intensity. The detection of the fluorescence lifetime as oxygen dependent is not affected by external light sources, changes in the pH, ions or salinity. Changes of the optical properties of the sample like opacity, coloration or the refractive index falsify the fluorescence intensity, but not the lifetime.",

Biosensors are devices which utilize a specific enzymatic reaction to obtain an electrical signal which is proportional to the concentration of the analyte to be quantified. Due to the enzymatic nature of the sensor, a separate sensor has to be used for each analyte. These sensors are most commonly used offline, meaning a sample is taken aseptically from the culture and analyzed outside the system, but automatic on-line sampling devices are also available if preferred. In all cases the enzymatic reaction, e.g., an oxidase reaction, results in a product that can be easily detected, e.g., hydrogen peroxide.",

Another approach to quantify nutrient and byproduct concentrations is the flow injection analysis (FIA). A liquid sample is injected into a stream of aqueous carrier stream and forms a pulse which can then be detected, based on changes in different physical parameters (e.g., absorbance, fluorescence, chemi-luminescence, etc.). Because each sensor can only detect one analyte, the sample flow is often split into different channels for a broader range of analytes to be monitored (Riley 2006; Chmiel 2006 ).",

The dye penetrates the broken membranes of dead cells and dyes them blue, binding to the proteins present in the cytosol (Butler 2004) . The membranes of viable cells inhibit the dye entering the cytosol and so these cells do not get dyed blue. A recent method to determine cell density and viability is the use of automated counters. These devices, e.g., Vi-Cell Cell Viability Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) are usually based on the trypan blue method and can help to quantify the determined data more rapidly and are less subjective. If needed, such a device can also be connected directly to a fermenter and samples taken and analyzed automatically (autosampler). Other online methods use probes inserted into the vessel and measure the absorbance of the culture with a Vertical Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VSCEL) at a wavelength of 850 nm (TruCell2 probe, Finesse, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Using this method, it is possible to determine only the total cell density within the culture, but not the percentage of dead cells.",
