            "text": "AVB is a disturbance of impulse conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node and/or the His\u2013Purkinje system that can be permanent or transient [18]. Atrial impulses can be conducted with delay or be completely blocked depending on anatomical or functional impairment along the conduction system [18]. Atrioventricular disturbances can occur as a result of a primary disorder or secondary to acute or chronic myocardial abnormalities [19]. In human medicine, two degenerative diseases (Lev and Lenegre diseases) have been described as idiopathic degeneration with fibrosis replacement of the intraventricular conduction system, with or without changes in the cardiac skeleton [19]. Similar degenerative changes have been reported in veterinary medicine in dogs with chronic mitral valve disease [20]. Any primary or secondary cardiac disease that affects the AV conduction system (congenital, acquired, or secondary to traumatic, neoplastic, infiltrative, inflammatory, and systemic disorders) may result in complete AVB. More rarely, congenital forms or functional disorders (hyperkalemia, toxicity, antiarrhythmic drugs, high vagal tone, and hyperthyroidism) have also been described [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. In human beings, the most common cause of transient AVB is acute myocarditis [32], [33]. The pathogenesis of transient AVB secondary to acute myocarditis implies the presence of myocardial interstitial edema, and a correlation between increased thickness of the edematous cardiac walls and severity of AVB has been described [34]. The same mechanism has been suspected in dogs, with unknown prevalence, as it has been documented that 13% of dogs presented with transient AV conduction disturbances [35]. Both experimental models and human patients with spontaneously occurring acute lymphocytic myocarditis very often present AVB that lasts a few days or, less frequently, 2\u20133 weeks, and then regresses completely during the convalescent stage of 2\u20134 weeks in 67%\u201396% of the patients [32], [33], [34], [36], [37]. In addition, one study reported regression of AVB with improvement recorded within one month from PM implantation in 13% of dogs [35]. In human beings, it has been reported that the prevalence of persistent AVB after acute myocarditis is of approximately 4% [34] and permanent PM implantation is required in these patients. In children, the occurrence of persistent AVB after resolution of acute myocarditis is higher (28%) [33]. Chronic myocarditis as a cause of longstanding AVB in human beings is considered somewhat uncommon [38]. In dogs, the prevalence of myocarditis-related AVB is unknown, and a few studies have described acute myocarditis in dogs with AVB based on postmortem examination [22], [23], [30] or using endomyocardial biopsy [39]. This latter study defined enteric coronavirus as the pathogen that most commonly causes acute myocarditis and AVB in dogs. In one of these case reports, a very high serum concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was documented and the authors suggested that this biomarker might help detect dogs with AVB secondary to active myocarditis [22]. Another study proved that cTnI is high at the time of presentation in dogs with permanent AVB but showed a significant reduction over time after PM implantation [40], [41]. Lead type and arrhythmia severity did not show significant correlation with cTnI [40]. In human medicine, endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for in vivo diagnosis of myocarditis and increased serum concentrations of cTnI and cardiac troponin T are considered reliable to confirm the diagnosis [42], [43], [44].",

The occurrence of sudden cardiac death among the population of dogs with AVB is 42.7%, and the occurrence of sudden death is reported to be similar in dogs with second and third-degree AVB (40.6% and 32.8%, respectively). From the diagnosis, 24% of dogs die within 30 days and 40% of dogs die within six months [9]. These data confirmed previous findings in human medicine that suggested a high sudden death rate in the first year with a mortality rate of approximately 24% in the first month and 40% in the first 6 months [9]. In veterinary medicine, age does not seem to be associated with sudden death [9], in contrast with human medicine, in which older age has been negatively associated with survival times [53]. The presence of clinical signs also does not seem to be correlated with survival, although high ventricular escape rates and narrower QRS complexes have been negatively associated with survival times [9]. Studies evaluating the association between escape rhythm QRS complex width and survival times have not been performed in humans. Usually, in dogs with AVB, the site of origin of the escape rhythm is just distal to the site of block [9]. Generally, nodal AVB would result in a narrower QRS complex escape rhythm, generated in the proximal tissues, whereas infranodal AVB would likely result in a wider QRS complex escape rhythm, originating in the Purkinje fibers. Findings in veterinary medicine suggest that dogs with third-degree AVB and wide QRS complex escape rhythms have better survival times than those with narrow QRS complex escape rhythms [9]. This might suggest that the QRS width of the escape rhythms may not be accurate for assessing the site of AVB in dogs and dogs with escape rhythms generated in more proximal junctional tissues have a poorer prognosis [9].",

            "text": "Sinus node disease is the term generally applied to sinus node dysfunction (SND) that may be manifested electrocardiographically by severe sinus bradycardia and sinoatrial (SA) block/arrest. Such electrocardiographic abnormalities are frequently accompanied by recurrent episodes of focal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (AF), or atrial flutter, resulting in alternation between paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and slow atrial and ventricular rates [54]. Some authors consider that the diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) in human beings requires the presence of clinical signs compatible with syncope and similar electrocardiographic findings in an asymptomatic patient warrant a diagnosis of SND rather than SSS [55], [56]. In human beings, involvement of the right atrial wall has been proven when conspicuous alterations of the SA node and its approaches have been documented. These changes include total or subtotal destruction of the SA node, areas of nodal-atrial discontinuity, inflammatory or degenerative changes in the nerves and ganglias surrounding the SA node, and pathological changes in the atrial wall [18], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61]. It has also been proven that, although frequently associated with underlying heart disease and seen most often in the elderly, SSS may occur in the fetus, infant, and child without apparent cause [62]. In this setting, SSS is presumed to be congenital and correlated with a mutation of the alpha SCN5A. In fact, biophysical characterization of the mutants demonstrates loss of function or significant impairments in channel gating (inactivation) that predict reduced myocardial excitability [62]. These findings reveal a molecular basis for some forms of congenital SSS and define a recessive disorder of a human heart voltage-gated sodium channel [62].",

In one study, survival times did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs or between dogs that received PM implantation and dogs that were medically treated (theophylline, propantheline, hyoscyamine, terbutaline) [63]. In dogs, the most common cause of death in the SSS population is euthanasia for non-cardiac\u2013related disease, even though several reported non-cardiac\u2013related causes could have been exacerbated by low cardiac output, causing poor peripheral perfusion [63]. In fact, it has been reported that total survival time and risk of sudden cardiac death in human beings with SND, irrespective of symptoms, are similar to that of the general population [67]. Dogs with SND do not require treatment, whereas dogs with SSS often require PM implantation to reduce the frequency of syncope. The prognosis of SSS in dogs is usually good, although development of congestive heart failure does not appear to be mitigated by PM implantation [63].",

In human beings, PAS has been described to occur in conjunction with a number of muscular dystrophy disorders and with amyloidosis and myocarditis [70], [71], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79]. In dogs, although neuromuscular disease, long-standing cardiac disease, and myocarditis have been proposed as cause of PAS, this rhythm disturbance is generally attributed to atrial myopathy [80], [81]. Atrial myopathy is characterized by progressive loss of atrial myocardium, with loss of the ability to conduct impulses, histological findings of myocardial necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and replacement fibrosis. Both the atrial myocardium and the conduction system are affected [74], [75], [79], [80], [82], [83]. In humans, atrial pacing with an output as high as 25 mA is used to confirm the presence or absence of atrial depolarizations [79]. Persistent atrial standstill has to be differentiated from temporary atrial standstill, which can be secondary to digitalis toxicity, quinidine toxicity, myocardial infarction, hyperkalemia, hypoxia, and hypothermia [74], [75], [76], [83].",

Prognosis in human beings with PAS is variable and rapid disease progression is noted in individuals affected by underlying cardiac disease, such as myocarditis. Congestive heart failure is frequently reported as the cause of death in people with this finding [88]. It has been initially suggested that dogs with PAS have a poor prognosis, despite PM implantation, although some studies showed that the survival times are similar to other bradyarrhythmias [2], [7], [71], [74], [75], [89]. The median survival time of PAS dogs was reported to be approximately 28 months after pacing, indicating that these animals can be expected to survive a similar amount of time to dogs affects by other bradyarrhythmias [74]. However, of the dogs with PAS that died, 64% suffered a cardiac-related death [74], which appears to be a relatively high incidence compared with other bradyarrhythmias, where it varies from 22% to 60% [2], [7], [12]. Despite the high incidence of cardiac-related death in PAS dogs, no difference in survival times was noted between cardiac and non-cardiac causes of death [74].",

            "text": "Disturbances of the autonomic nervous system can induce either slow heart rate or depressed vascular tone (or both), causing transient cerebral hypoperfusion and, ultimately, transient self-limited episodes of loss of consciousness [90]. Traditionally, reflex syncope refers to a heterogeneous group of conditions in which cardiovascular reflexes that are normally useful in controlling the circulation become intermittently inappropriate in response to a trigger [91]. Triggering situations vary considerably in and between individual patients, and, in most cases, the efferent pathway does not strongly depend on the nature of the trigger. Based on the trigger, reflex syncope can be classified as VVS (mediated by emotion or by orthostatic stress), situational syncope (traditionally associated with specific circumstances, such as cough, swallowing, post-exercise, vomiting, micturition, and defecation), carotid sinus syncope (mechanical manipulation of the carotid sinuses), and \u2018atypical form\u2019 with uncertain or even apparently absent triggers [92]. Swallowing and cough syncope have been reported in the dog [93], [94]. In human medicine, it has been proposed that frequent vasovagal-mediated cardiac asystole may be a potential cause of sudden cardiac death [95]. In addition, in human medicine, PM therapy has gained new impetus in the light of the most recent studies and it has been suggested that, considering the not insignificant complications associated with pacing, PM implantation should only be considered in patients aged >40 years, with severe recurrent syncope, in whom long asystole periods have been documented with an implantable loop recorder [96]. In veterinary medicine, PM implantation has been described in dogs with VVS that presented transient loss of consciousness after excitement or cough [12]. Syncope markedly reduced in frequency after pacing, whereas pre-syncope was unaffected. This is likely due to the coexistence of hypotension and bradycardia as a cause of VVS. Pacing can ameliorate bradycardia but not hypotension at the time of collapse [12], [97].",

Overall, tilt testing and carotid sinus massage display a high positivity rate in patients with unexplained falls (about 60%). These data seem to indicate that some unexplained falls could be cases of atypical VVS/carotid sinus syncope with retrograde amnesia. Some clinical features suggest that syncope during sleeping hours is a form of VVS with a different clinical presentation: high prevalence of autonomic prodromes, diurnal episodes of typical VVS and specific phobias, and positive tilt testing with severe cardioinhibition [102].",

It has been proven that, in patients with first-degree AVB, cardiac pacing is not recommended unless the PQ interval fails to adapt to the heart rate during exercise and is long enough (usually > 300 ms) to cause symptoms due to inadequate left ventricular filling or to an increase in wedge pressure, as the left atrial systole occurs close to or simultaneous with the previous left ventricular systole [67]. In such cases, small, uncontrolled studies have shown an improvement in symptoms with normalization of the PQ interval with dual-chamber pacing (AV resynchronization therapy) [67]. In veterinary medicine, one study that analyzed long-term intrinsic rhythm in dogs with AV nodal conduction disturbances had proven that the majority of cases showed persistent or progressive AVB [35]. In particular, paroxysmal third-degree AVB progressed to permanent third-degree AVB and most cases of 2:1 second degree AVB also progressed to third-degree AVB [35]. These findings are not in agreement with human medicine, in which 2:1 second degree AVB is considered to be stable [123], but support the need for PM implantation in dogs affected by paroxysmal third-degree AVB and 2:1 s degree AVB [35].",

As previously reported in both human and veterinary medicine, because cardiac pacing is not known to prolong survival in patients with SSS, permanent pacing is currently used to relieve symptoms attributed to bradycardia in these patients [63], [67]. Although the quality of evidence in human studies is modest, there is a strong consensus that human and dogs with SSS will benefit from cardiac pacing for symptom relief [63], [67]. In human medicine, the usefulness of cardiac pacing in patients showing chronotropic incompetence is uncertain, and the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis [67]. In agreement with human medicine [67], dogs affected by sinus node disease are generally old and frequently have concomitant structural heart disease. It has been proven that congestive heart failure is common in dogs affected by sinus node disease and is present in 14% of this population, accounting for 20% of total deaths and 65% of cardiac deaths [63]. In these situations, demonstration of a clear cause\u2013effect relationship between symptoms and sinus node disease is often difficult to achieve [63], [67].",

            "text": "In human medicine, it has been proved that when compared with single-chamber pacing, dual-chamber pacing results in small but potentially important benefits for patients with AVB and/or sinus node disease, even if a difference in mortality has not been observed [126], [127], [128], [129], [130]. More than a quarter of patients with VVI (ventricle-paced, ventricle-sensed inhibition of PM in case of sensed intrinsic activity) pacing develop \u2018PM syndrome\u2019, which reduces quality of life [67]. In crossover trials, symptoms of PM syndrome (dyspnea, dizziness, palpitations, pulsations, and chest pain) were reduced by reprogramming the PM to dual-chamber mode [67]. Overall, dual-chamber pacing is associated with better exercise performance compared with fixed-responsive, but not with rate-responsive VVI pacing [67]. In veterinary medicine, one study analyzed atrial single-chamber PM implantation for the treatment of SND [131]. Dogs affected by SND can be paced from the atria, which provides a more physiologic approach to management. In dogs with no coexisting AVB evaluated by 24-h Holter monitoring, AAI/AAIR (atrium-paced, atrium-sensed inhibition of PM in case of sensed intrinsic activity, R Rate modulation) pacing modality can be considered [131]. In human medicine, during permanent PM implantation, a stepped-up atrial pacing protocol is used to identify the AV nodal Wenckebach blocking point. A Wenckebach point of <120 beats per minute in humans is considered a contraindication for single-chamber atrial pacing [132], [133], [134]. The corresponding Wenckebach point limit in dogs anesthetized with a variety of drugs is unknown and would need to be established before recommendations can be made [131]. Nevertheless, in a limited case series of operators with limited experience in the specific implantation procedure, the incidence of complications related to atrial lead stability appeared to be high [131]. In human medicine, it has been proven that AVB develops in 0.6%\u20131.9% of patients with sinus node disease, which represents a disadvantage of AAIR pacing [67]. These findings support the routine use of dual-paced, dual-sensed, dual mode of response rate modulation, rather than AAIR, pacing in patients with SSS [67]. Also, in human medicine, in patients with sinus standstill, dual-chamber pacing is considered the pacing mode of choice [67], whereas AAIR is not considered for routine use [130]. Unnecessary right ventricular pacing should be systematically avoided in patients with sinus standstill by programming the PM with a long AV interval [135], [136]. However, programming an excessively long AV interval to avoid RV pacing in patients with prolonged AV conduction may be disadvantageous from a hemodynamic point of view by causing diastolic mitral regurgitation [135], [136].",

            "text": "Both in human and veterinary medicine, synchronous AV pacing can be performed with a single lead physiologic pacing with VDD (V Ventricle paced, D Dual sensed, D Dual mode of response) modality or with two leads with DDD modality (Fig. 9\nA and B). As per the guidelines for human patients [67], the primary indication for single lead physiologic pacing is third-degree AVB with normal SA node function, because VDD PMs are unable to pace the atria during periods of sinus arrest and they are unable to maintain AV synchrony in patients with sinus node disease [3], [10], [110]. The prevalence of chronotropic incompetence in dogs with third-degree AVB is unknown. The potential for humans to develop sinus node disease after PM implantation is one argument against the utilization of a single lead physiologic PM [138]. In veterinary medicine, it has been described that dogs that present an atrial rate <70 beats per minute and a negative atropine response test (<25% increase of sinus rate 20\u201330 min post 0.04 mg/kg atropine SQ injection) [63] are excluded from consideration of single lead VDD PM implantation [110]. Other contraindications to physiologic VDD PMs are represented by AVB complicated by AF or supraventricular tachycardia. Although physiologic pacing cannot be achieved in patients with AF, the automatic mode switching in most new generation pulse generators can help preventing inappropriate ventricular stimulation if infrequent paroxysms of non-sustained AF or supraventricular tachycardia occur during VDD pacing [110]. Furthermore, the atrial dipole of the lead has to be placed at the junction of the cranial vena cava and right atrium to avoid inappropriate atrial sensing. The likelihood to achieve this goal is dependent on the size of the dog and on the distance between the atrial array and the ventricular electrode (AV distance) [110]. A strict minimum weight for VDD PM implantation is difficult to establish but, in general, it is easier to appropriately position the pacing lead in larger dogs [110]. In veterinary medicine, no large-scale, long-term studies in dogs with naturally occurring third-degree AVB are available, and the decision of a physiologic PM mode implantation is based on the age of the dog and on its level of physical activity [110]. Younger dogs seem to be good candidates for physiologic pacing because they can potentially live longer and may be more active, although older dogs may also benefit because of concurrent structural heart disease [110]. Working, hunting, and agility dogs may benefit from AV synchronous pacing, and a short-term study revealed 44% increase in echocardiographically determined stroke volume and 28% increase cardiac output during VDD pacing compared with fixed-rate VVI pacing [139]. Whether these data are confirmed during exercise is uncertain, although an experimental study suggests a limitation in stroke volume reserve during fixed-rate VVI pacing [140]. In veterinary medicine, it has been described that, perhaps, a sub-population of dogs with third-degree AVB associated with structural heart disease could have the greatest advantage from physiologic VDD pacing stimulation because of the presence of AV synchrony and not-fixed RR interval compared with VVI pacing [110]. In fact, by pacing the ventricle after the atrial contraction, physiologic PMs help avoid atrial contraction against a closed AV mitral valve and may limit mitral valve insufficiency, thereby decreasing mean left atrial pressures [139], [140], [141], [142], [143]. Lower left atrial pressures associated with prolonged diastolic filling time and appropriate AV synchrony may enhance left ventricular filling and improve systolic performance [142]. Although one study in dogs demonstrated that dual-chamber PM implantation resulted in increased procedural and anesthetic times, compared with single-chamber PM implantation, it did not result in higher complication rates [13], [144]. Nevertheless, a more recent retrospective study demonstrated no statistically significant benefit in survival times in dogs that received a physiologic VDD PM compared with dogs that received a non-physiologic VVI PM [13]. These data are consistent with prospective studies in human beings comparing single-chamber (VVIR) (R Rate modulation) and dual-chamber (DDD) pacing to analyze the impact of physiologic pacing on mortality. These studies only demonstrated secondary benefits, such as the decrease in AF and improved quality of life, but without any effect on mortality [97], [126], [145], [146]. As previously stated, non-physiologic pacing may be associated with PM syndrome [147]. Although, historically, intolerance to VVI pacing has been considered an infrequent consequence to ventricular pacing, a crossover study identified that 65% of human being experienced moderate to severe clinical signs consistent with PM syndrome [148]. Numerous studies have evaluated and identified significant improvements in cardiovascular symptom scores and self-perceived health between physiologic and non-physiologic pacing (both VVI and VVIR) [149], [150], [151], [152], [153], [154], [155], [156], [157]. In veterinary medicine, one retrospective study analyzed the perceived symptomatic improvement in quality of life or exercise tolerance by asking owners to complete a quality of life questionnaire, but no statistically significant differences were identified between the two pacing modalities. Whether there are no quality of life benefits, the benefits are too subtle to be detected by the owners in otherwise sedentary dogs, or the quality of life questionnaire was inappropriately designed to document clinical benefits is difficult to determine [139].",

In human beings, the standard use of biventricular pacing is for cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with systolic dysfunction, ventricular conduction delay, and heart failure [67]. The use of biventricular pacing in patients with third-degree AVB is aimed to maintain a synchronous ventricular activation pattern. This may preserve ventricular function over a long period and prevent myocardial failure, occasionally noted in veterinary patients [158], [159]. Newly developed congestive heart failure after PM implantation not associated with AV valvular or primary myocardial disease is reported in 3.6%\u201311.5% of patients [2], [7], [9], [10], [12]. Furthermore, patients affected by third-degree AVB associated with chronic degenerative mitral valve disease or dilated cardiomyopathy may be more sensitive to bisynchronous apical right ventricular pacing [158]. Dogs with preexisting congestive heart failure secondary to myxomatous degenerative mitral valve disease or dilated cardiomyopathy presented 1-year mortality rate more than twice when compared with dogs without initial evidence of congestive heart failure [2]. In human medicine, it has been proven that pacing at any ventricular site leads to abnormal ventricular activation and the sequence of ventricular activation is more important for left ventricular function than the temporal synchronization within the left ventricular myocardium [160], [161]. In dogs, it has been shown that, at least in the acute phase, biventricular pacing appears to improve some indices of myocardial performance [158], [159]. The left ventricular function improvement may be related to the normalization of the ventricular activation sequence, because right and left ventricles are synchronous, and not only to the normalization of the activation of the left ventricle alone [158]. Compared with dual chamber, biventricular pacing systems are more expensive and many patients that need PM implantation are too small for these systems [158].",
