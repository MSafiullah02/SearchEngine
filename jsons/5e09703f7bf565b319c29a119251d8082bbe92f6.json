Parvoviruses are among the most dependent on host cellular functions for replication, and they only multiply in cells that are in the process of replicating their own DNA [17] . Human parvovirus B19, an Erythrovirus, only replicates during the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle. Adeno-associated viruses in the genus Dependovirus depend on coinfection with adenovirus or herpesviruses that induce DNA synthesis in the host cell to facilitate their own replication. However, the other members of the genus Bocavirus-bovine bocavirus and canine minute virus-do not require a helper virus, and most of the HBoV coinfecting viruses that we identified do not induce DNA replication in the host cell. One possibility is that coviral-induced cellular damage results in high levels of cellular division and differentiation, creating conditions permissive for HBoV replication. A similar mechanism has been shown for polyomavirus infection in mice [18] . In addition, respiratory viral infections may suppress immune system functions to make the host more susceptible to infection with HBoV.
