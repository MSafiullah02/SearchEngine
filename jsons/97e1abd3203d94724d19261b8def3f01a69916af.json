Current public health emergency efforts have centered around limiting exposures, reducing transmission, and \"flattening the curve\" so that the gap between health care capacity and patient care needs is smaller when the number of active cases peak. 7, 8 Epidemiological data analyses forecast a peak in the number of new COVID-19 cases that varies widely by locality, with the large metropolitan areas of New York, Seattle, New Orleans, and Detroit experiencing earlier surges-prototypic experiences that may help other areas identify with more certainty how many diagnosed cases transition into requiring acute care hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and often prolonged mechanical ventilation. [9] [10] [11] [12] We discuss the immediate COVID- 19 shocks, what might be expected in the near future, and likely future ebbs and flows of response to COVID-19.",

Small-to medium-sized private practice groups whose professional compensation is directly linked to payment for services may be forced to reduce staffing levels more quickly than larger practices and those with other payment arrangements. In a practice arrangement that supports physician anesthesiologists, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), and anesthesiologist assistants, decisions regarding the number and type of anesthesia professionals who are furloughed (laid off) are challenging and stressful for practice leaders. Planning for when or if they can be rehired is not feasible until the pandemic subsides.

For example, pain medicine specialists with limited critical care or surgical experience may be well positioned to offer consultations using telemedicine technologies, while anesthesiologists who primarily work in ambulatory surgery settings will be more impacted by the sudden reduction and delays in resuming nonessential surgical procedures. Shortterm demand for some essential procedures with some flexibility to preschedule, notably those related to normal labor and delivery, have increased temporarily in preparation for anticipated COVID-19 cases.

Surge demand for delivering care to critically ill patients will undoubtedly lead to increased risk to the mental health, including stress and burnout, because the role of trained anesthesiologists in caring for ventilator patients is central to supporting the pandemic response. 14 Caring for critically ill patients with COVID-19 also carries an added risk to the health of anesthesiology professionals and their families.

The impact of this shock is a reduction in the supply of anesthesia services because it reduces the ability of providers to deliver care using the same types of inputs. Lower availability of some inputs will have a more dramatic impact on anesthesia services than others, such as the conversions of anesthesia equipment for use as ventilators. In the short term, this equipment cannot be used to support perioperative care.

Changes in the health care workforce may take longer to recover. While the federal stimulus provided through the CARES Act will help mitigate the impact of temporary workforce reductions caused by stopping nonessential procedures, other policies may not match shortterm changes in demand for anesthesia services. For example, on March 30, 2020, the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued regulatory waivers \"to rapidly expand the health care workforce,\" which included the temporary suspension of the requirements for physician supervision of CRNAs during the COVID-19 response. 21 Although well intentioned, there seems to be no economic need to do so in light of the reduction in nonessential surgical and procedural care. While these waivers are expected to expire when the pandemic ends, policies that change scope of practice for health care practitioners could have much longer-lasting effects. Anesthesiology is a preeminent specialty, and the value of physician anesthesiologists has been clearly demonstrated during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The US surgeon general is an anesthesiologist. The vice president of the United States recognized the leadership roles of physician anesthesiologists and the American Society of Anesthesiologists. 22 Anesthesiology will continue to be viewed as a more versatile and desirable specialty option for medical students due to the ability to have training in perioperative, pain, and critical care medicine. The number of anesthesiology residency programs and residents continues to increase. In 2020, anesthesiology had a 99.4% match with 1883 anesthesiology candidates matched to 1894 anesthesiology available positions. 23 These are unprecedented times. The immediate priorities are to mitigate the spread of the current pandemic, ensure appropriate health care services capacity, and provide health care professionals with the resources needed to effectively and safely care for COVID-19 patients. Anesthesiologists have quickly demonstrated their value beyond the perioperative setting in caring for critically ill medical patients. E ",
