This whole ecosystem, One Health approach focuses on prevention through the integration of wildlife, environmental, human, and domestic health sectors improving our ability to prevent rather than react to disease events. A true One Health viewpoint understands that all life is connected to its habitat, and the health of the whole sits squarely on a robust and sustainable environment. Safe food and water, thus ecological health, can be ensured using an evidence-based, transdisciplinary, collaborative based approach to the solution of food production and public health.",

Fig. 11 .1 One Health triad: Interconnection of humans, animals, and the environment Although One Health is becoming an increasingly mainstream fi eld of study today, the origins of One Health go back at least two centuries. In the nineteenth century, Rudolf Virchow, a German physician and pathologist, formally recognized the connection between human and animal health , stating, \"Between animal and human medicine there is no dividing line, nor should there be. The object is different, but the experience obtained constitutes the basis of all medicine\" (Kahn et al. 2007 ). Subsequently, the medical and veterinary professions noted the impact of animal diseases and ecological change on public health . Calvin Schwabe introduced the \"One Medicine\" concept in Veterinary Medicine and Human Health (Schwabe 1984 ) long after interest in the fi eld had waned in the early 1900s. In recent years, the One Health concept has steadily gained recognition within the human and animal health sciences. In July 2008, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) released the report, Executive Summary of the AVMA One Health Initiative Task Force . In collaboration with the American Medical Association, the initiative provides groundbreaking recommendations and strategic action to support and expand the One Health concept across both veterinary and human health professions.",

Examples of zoonotic diseases that started as a foodborne disease and then became transmissible by human-to-human contact include HIV, Ebola, and SARS; examples of zoonotic pathogens that continue to be spread through food include Salmonella , E. coli O157:H7 , Listeria monocytogenes , Campylobacter , and Cryptosporidium .",

Between 1998 and 2008, 46 % of foodborne illnesses were associated with fresh produce, 22 % were associated with meat and poultry, 20 % were associated with dairy and eggs, and 6.1 % of illnesses were associated with fi sh and shellfi sh (Painter et al. 2013 ) . Even though most cases of produce-associated illnesses are often attributed to contamination with Norovirus , a human pathogen, enteric zoonotic foodborne pathogens such as pathogenic E. coli , Salmonella , and Campylobacter cause a signifi cant amount of produce-associated foodborne outbreaks. Raw produce is at risk because there is often no kill step to reduce or eliminate the pathogen(s) that may contaminate the products at any point along the food production continuum. Further, many fresh-cut fruits and vegetables are not amenable to treatments to kill pathogens and some are fi eld-packed and thus not subject to a processing step (Jay-Russell 2013 ) . Thus, contamination at any place along the production chain can cause foodborne illness. The change in dietary preferences in Western cultures to consume more raw agricultural products, thus failing to have this fi nal kill step, whereby produce could be sterilized, is one of the reasons for the increase in produce-associated outbreaks. With this increase in occurrence of outbreaks in fresh produce, people have looked for the cause or source of contamination of these specifi c commodities.",

Wildlife may pose a risk to food safety as a probable source of contamination (California Department of Public Health 2007 ; Jay-Russell 2013 ; Rice 2014 ). However, there is often a lack of conclusive evidence implicating wildlife in foodborne illness outbreaks because they typically are not present at the time the traceback investigation is performed. An example of this is the 2006 outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in California's Salinas Valley in bagged spinach. This was the fi rst major outbreak involving fresh produce and sickened almost 200 people across 26 states and led to 3 deaths (CDC 2006). The \"root cause\" of the outbreak was not conclusively determined; however wildlife, especially feral swine, and grazing cattle were both implicated based on epidemiological and laboratory fi ndings during the outbreak investigation (Jay et al. 2007 , California Department of Public Health 2007 .

For example, barriers can be used to prevent access from some animals, but they are not all exclusive; poisons are toxic for many animals, not just the target animals, and have downstream effects such as decimating raptor populations; and habitat removal is detrimental to the environment and overall ecology.
