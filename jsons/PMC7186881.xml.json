A systematic review estimated the odds of transmission from tracheostomy (OR 4.2) as second only to intubation (OR 6.6).6 However, there was a paucity of studies on tracheostomy that prohibited a direct comparison of the procedures. In our opinion, current data vastly underestimate the risk of tracheostomy, in which droplet and blood splatter is virtually guaranteed. Healthcare practitioners performing tracheostomy are an at-risk population. In the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Toronto, many of those hospitalized with illness were healthcare workers8 who were exposed prior to major infection control measures were instituted. In Wuhan, China, 40 of 138 hospitalized patients were healthcare providers who were infected from presumed hospital spread.6",
