HIV-RT plays a key role at early stages of viral replication by catalyzing the RNA-dependent synthesis, ribonuclease H and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis of proviral double-stranded DNA.2 Compounds inhibiting HIV-RT are categorized as nucleoside/nucleotide (NRTI) and nonnucleoside (NNRTI) inhibitors. Nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors bind in the active site of HIV-RT, while the NNRTIs comprise a structurally diverse spectrum of compounds capable of initiating conformational changes in HIV-RT by binding allosterically, which then results in the loss of HIV-RT polymerase activity.3\n",

However due to the high genetic variability of the virus, resistant strains with one or more point mutations in the RT binding pocket rapidly developed, and these first generation drugs proved to be problematic.7 In contrast, second generation FDA-approved drugs including etravirine (TMC125)8 and rilpivirine (TMC278)9 proved to be highly active against both wild-type and the most frequent mutant HIV strains with enhanced safety profiles. Etravirine and rilpivirine are classified as diarylpyrimidines. More recently biaryl esters such as MK-4965 have further increased the structural diversity of the NNRTI inhibitors (Fig. 1\n).10 These biaryl ethers are also active against both wild-type and mutant RTs at nanomolar concentrations. Notably, the common feature of these two NNRTI types, as well as many others, particularly, the benzophenone derivatives 1\n11 is the presence of three aromatic rings connected by short linkers (Fig. 2\n).",

It is more attractive than a benzene ring because of increased potential to form polar intermolecular interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions, both of which can improve enzyme affinity and the pharmacokinetic properties of target compounds. Drawing upon the structural features of other highly active NNRTIs,12, 13 we previously reported14 a series of benzophenone derivatives of pyrimidines 2 with potent antiretroviral activity. Like the original benzophenones 1 reported by GlaxoSmithKline (Fig. 2)11, 12 our compounds featured replacement of the distal benzene ring by uracil. As a logical extension of our previous investigations, herein we have prepared a new series of compounds with the central aromatic system replaced by uracil (Fig. 3\n).",

            "text": "In comparison to the benzophenone derivative GW78248, significant differences in the benzyl and benzoyl cores\u2019 orientations were observed, although the overall binding mode was retained. Strong correlation between the benzophenone\u2019s and uracil\u2019s carbonyl groups is also noteworthy and hypothesized to be a consequence of steric preferences. As depicted in Figure 6, unfavorable \u03c0-stacking interactions associated with mutations at Tyr181 and Tyr188 are also predicted, along with the lack of H-bonding at Asn103. These findings may explain the dramatic loss in activity against K103N and some other mutant HIV strains. As a result, further optimization of this region should be pursued. Cinnamyl derivatives 28\u201334 were modeled in analogous manner and follow similar binding patterns (data not shown).",

This can be explained by the interactions of the groups of ring R2 with Trp229 (Fig. 3), while proton substitution in position 4 disrupts the favorable CH\u2013\u03c0 stacking (compounds 17 and 20). In contrast, the extended groups in position 4 of ring R1 are not favorable as they reach solvent accessible area at the entrance of the pocket. The absence of binding for compound 20 is due to steric restrictions between the methyl group in the ortho position of the R2 ring and the carbonyl oxygens in the central uracil ring R3 since they are densely packed in the pocket. However it appears there are still enough degrees of freedom to properly orientate the R2 ring when only one methyl group in the ortho position is present (compound 18).",

            "text": "A series of phenyloxyethyl and cinnamyl derivatives of substituted uracils were synthesized and found to be inhibitory against HIV-RT and HIV replication in cell culture. In general, the cinnamyl derivatives proved somewhat superior to the phenyloxyethyl derivatives, however inhibition of mutant HIV-1 RT was less pronounced when additional NNRTI-characteristic mutations were present in the enzyme. Moreover, the double mutant K103N/Y181C was detrimental for anti-HIV-1 activity. Some cinnamyl derivatives showed moderate anti-HCMV activity, however this was not the case for the phenyloxyethyl derivatives, which were essentially inactive. Efforts are currently underway to improve the promising activity noted by several of the compounds. New structural modifications guided by additional docking efforts are currently being explored. For example, it may prove that the N1-side chain can be optimized for maximizing interactions with the amino acid landscape by use of H-bond donors and/or introducing conformational restrictions. These results will be reported elsewhere as they are obtained.",

The antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.",

The test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and added to both assays to a final 10% DMSO concentration. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, and applied onto Whatman 3MM filters. After drying on air the filters were washed 2\u00d7 with 10% trichloroacetic acid, then 2\u00d7 with 5% trichloroacetic acid, once with ethanol and then air-dried.
