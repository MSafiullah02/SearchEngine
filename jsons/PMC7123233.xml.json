Between June and August 2004, the province conducted a door-to-door census, asking whether anyone in the household had sold blood during the mid-1990s. Some 280,300 people said that they had; every one of them was offered a free HIV test. Since individual pretest counselling was judged to be impractical on such a large scale, people were informed of the process of HIV testing and of its benefits through poster and public information campaigns; campaigns that started before the census was even conducted. \u201cThe testing campaign was a powerful education tool in its own right, not just for the public, but also for policy makers\u201d, observed Wu. \u201cAll those hundreds of thousands of tests, it just normalised HIV testing and really reduced stigma. It went beyond the health system; the testing campaign mobilised all of society to participate\u201d. The government invested a great deal to arrive at this success, not just politically but also financially, according to former Vice Minister of Health Longde Wang. \u201cGovernment took many measures to support the screening in the regions: building roads, schools, and wells; setting up clinics and providing free treatment\u201d.",

Slightly over half of those were in what are known as \u201cdiscordant couples\u201d, where the infected person has a husband or wife who is not infected. Knowing that they were living with the virus provided these men and women with an important opportunity to avoid passing on the infection within the family. Local health staff provided post-test counselling to those who tested positive, as well as free condoms for those who needed them. They also referred people for the follow-up tests they would need to determine whether they were ready to begin treatment, which at that time was offered to people who had fewer than 200 CD4 cells per millilitre of blood, a measure of a severely compromised immune system.

The Ministry of Health expert committee that visited Henan a year after the screening finished found that in the 10 months following the mass screening, over 6700 former plasma sellers had chosen to have voluntary HIV tests. Some of these may have been from among the 23,000 or so identified blood sellers who refused testing during the mass screening. But it was also clear that a lot of people had refused testing in a more passive way, by simply not reporting that they had sold blood. When they saw that people who tested HIV positive in the mass screenings were not persecuted and that many did in fact have access to free treatment as promised, they began to come forward of their own accord to the voluntary testing centres set up by the government in many hospitals and clinics.",

In a careful analysis of data from just four testing sites over the next 7 months, a third of over 700 former blood sellers were found to be infected. That suggests that the woman who chatted with Zunyou Wu was not exceptional. People who suspected they might be infected were more likely than others to avoid participating in the screening but came forward once they saw that they would get financial and health-care support if they did indeed have HIV. However, the committee reported: \u201cFrom an analysis of the situation based on data collected through this mass screenings and from discussions with the people involved, the expert group believes that the proportion of former plasma donors who deliberately hid their HIV status is not very high\u201d. They estimated that around 15% of people who had actually sold plasma in the outbreak years and who were still alive at the time of the 2004 census denied having sold blood. Interestingly, the four-site study showed that many other people who had not sold plasma but who thought they might have been exposed in other ways also sought out free HIV tests at public services after the screening. Of the people who feared they might be at risk because they had received a blood transfusion, over half were infected with HIV. Some 39% of the men and women who were worried that they may have been infected with HIV through sex also tested positive.",

It is worth noting, however, that since the outbreak occurred around 1995, many of those infected would have died by the time of the screening a decade later. Without treatment, half of people with otherwise healthy immune systems who contract HIV sexually will have died 9 years after they become infected [5]. In poor farming communities where people may have been serially exposed to high infusions of the virus through repeated blood sales and where access to any kind of healthcare is very poor, the proportion who died within a decade of the outbreak would probably have been much higher.",

With a Herculean effort but in a very short space of time, it provided a robust idea of the extent of the HIV epidemic in the province, putting to rest fears that local authorities were covering up an epidemic. The public, policymakers and health-care providers all learned a great deal about HIV during the campaign; the stigma that continues to loom over the disease was dented, and many people lost their fear of HIV testing. Most importantly, the screening ratcheted up access to prevention and treatment services for those affected, in part because it identified those in need of care, but also because it motivated service providers to work more effectively. \u201cOur efforts had a good impact in terms of HIV prevention and control, and made the international community change its attitude towards the screening\u201d, observed former Vice Minister of Health Longde Wang. Following Henan\u2019s success, the Ministry of Health in Beijing encouraged the other provinces that had an active blood trade to screen all people who had sold plasma there, too. These mass screenings were implemented between October 2004 and June 2005. By the end of June 2005, among 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities excluding Xinjiang, a total of 1,274,046 former plasma sellers had been registered, and 904,746 of them (71%) had been tested for HIV. A total of 25,030 were confirmed HIV positive, giving an overall HIV prevalence among former plasma sellers of 2.8%.",

Yunnan had the oldest and most severe HIV epidemic in China. Driven at first by the sharing of needles between drug injectors, the virus had since spread through the province\u2019s active sex industry. Unlike former blood sellers, people who took drugs and sold and bought sex were considered by many to have brought the disease upon themselves. On top of that, the behaviours that had resulted in their contracting HIV were illegal. And unlike the wave of plasma-driven infections, Yunnan\u2019s epidemic was not a one-time outbreak confined to the past. New infections were taking place every day. All of this meant that mass screening in Yunnan posed different challenges compared with in the central provinces of China.",

But they were also concerned that the screening would be damaging to gay men, sex workers and above all drug users, exposing them to arrest and increasing the stigma with which they had to cope daily. Public health officials who supported screening all those at high risk, on the other hand, argued that approaches developed in an age before treatment was available, and that prioritised an individual\u2019s privacy above all else, were inappropriate in an age of treatment. \u201cThe international community was very critical, saying this was a violation of human rights, and of course not international best practice\u201d, remembers Zunyou Wu.

This is because the likelihood of passing HIV onto a sexual partner depends in large part on the amount of virus in one\u2019s blood or body fluids. Antiretroviral medicines suppress HIV, so people who start on correct treatment early enough in the course of their HIV infection are very, very much less likely to pass infection onto their sex partners than people whose infection remains untreated. In other words, treatment supports the right to a healthy life for people who are living with HIV, while at the same time protecting the public by reducing the spread of the virus. To start on treatment, you have to know you have HIV. And that means taking a test.",

Most other provinces had emulated Yunnan and greatly increased testing in the groups most at risk for HIV. This information, added to step up sentinel surveillance, was critical to building up a more accurate picture of the epidemic in this vast and hugely diverse country. The other important component of better estimates, every bit as influential in the final results, was the estimated size of each risk population. By testing a fixed number of people in a given risk population over a couple of weeks once a year, sentinel surveillance systems could provide a fairly robust picture of HIV prevalence for each risk group. For example, a sentinel site for drug users in one county in Yunnan might report that 87 of 200 drug injectors had tested positive for HIV. In other words, HIV prevalence among injectors in that area was 43.5%. Similarly, testing of 200 female sex workers in a market town in Guangdong found only one infection, so prevalence there would be 0.5%. To turn that into an estimate of the total numbers infected, we have to know 43.5% of what? Half a percent of how many? In the mid-2000s, only a handful of countries worldwide had made systematic and transparent estimates of the numbers of people in each of the groups that carry an especially high risk of exposure to HIV.

In multiplier methods, you take a known quantity, and then use other data, sometimes from a survey, sometimes from a different, unrelated source, to estimate data that are missing from the original list. It would not be practical, for example, to count every single sex worker in every single establishment in a town. But most towns do have a list of licensed massage parlours, karaoke bars and night clubs and beauty salons. A \u201cquick and dirty\u201d survey in the town might reveal that 90% of karaoke bars and clubs, 50% of massage parlours and just 15% of beauty parlours are licensed. During the same survey, researchers count the number of women employed at a random subset of those establishments and the number that sell sex. This information can then be applied to the list of licensed premises. First, researchers construct a \u201ccomplete list\u201d, adjusting the number upwards to reflect the missing establishments in each category. Then they multiply the number of establishments by the average number of women selling sex in each type of location. Of course many more sophisticated adjustments can be made, but overall, multiplier methods have now been shown to provide fairly robust estimates of the number of people engaged in high-risk behaviours in many different countries and settings.",

These estimates can of course be made at many levels. A small, relatively homogenous country might make a single estimate for each of the risk groups nationwide. But a country as large and diverse as China must make estimates at much lower administrative levels. In 2005, for the first time, enough data were available to try to make systematic estimates at the level of the prefecture (the highest administrative level after the province). One province, Guangdong, went even further, making separate estimates for each county and then summing them up to get the provincial total.",

They would construct the spreadsheets so that the outputs \u2013 the absolute numbers infected \u2013 were hidden from participants in the process. Those participants included a wide range of people who had information or experience to contribute to the exercise: among them local health staff and people from the public security bureau, from the department overseeing the entertainment industry and from groups providing prevention and care services to those at risk. All had to agree on two things: the methods and the input data.

This put the country\u2019s leaders in a quandary. On the one hand, they had just made a huge political commitment to tackling the HIV epidemic honestly and transparently. In other words, they had committed to telling the truth about the magnitude of the epidemic. On the other hand, that truth, arrived at using internationally sanctioned methods, showed that the HIV problem was not as severe as had been anticipated. Indeed the estimate was only three-quarters as high as the government\u2019s own previous estimate. This was bound to lead to accusations of a cover-up. It did not help that World AIDS Day was approaching fast: everyone in the AIDS world knew that new estimates were underway, and they expected an announcement with great media fanfare on December 1st.",

As the HIV surveillance system becomes more comprehensive, with sites established over a greater variety of areas, data provide a better approximation of reality. This pattern applies all over the world. Indeed in 2007, UNAIDS revised its estimates of the number of people living with HIV worldwide down from 40 million to 33 million for largely the same reasons \u2013 the geographical expansion of surveillance systems showed that there was more variation in the epidemic than previously thought [7].",
