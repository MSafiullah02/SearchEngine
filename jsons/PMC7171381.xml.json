The nature of an outbreak can range from infectious, zoonotic, or chronic diseases to injury, exposure to toxic substances, or health-damaging behavior. The cause can be incidental, accidental, or intentional, as in the case of a bioterrorism attack. Outbreaks require public health investigators to respond quickly and to make reasonable judgments from a dynamically unfolding set of information. Speed, coordination, and informed judgment are critical in these situations, as problems that first appear limited may actually be significant outbreaks. A variety of approaches to outbreak detection and identification are possible, but the main points to keep in mind are described in the following section.",

Measles are currently very rare in the Western hemisphere: The number of reported cases between 1997 and 2004 was less than 200 per year (Atkinson et al., 2007). This highly contagious disease is currently most common in the United States among persons who refuse vaccination for personal or religious reasons. Outbreaks are often related to the importation of a case from abroad that acts as a source case for an outbreak (Atkinson et al., 2007). In the United States, suspected measles cases have to be promptly reported to the CDC and to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), after which an investigation is launched (Figure 2\n; CDC, 2010a).",

To ensure that the surveillance system is able to detect cases in a timely fashion, the system itself has to be monitored. One indicator to follow in the measles surveillance system, for example, is the median interval between onset of rash and notification to the public health authority. This indicator measures the time lost to contain the spread of the infection. This is shown by a measles outbreak that occurred in the United States after a 34-year-old minister with an undocumented history of vaccination became infected while traveling abroad (Rooney et al., 2004). The first symptoms were noticed on 2 September 1999; the case was diagnosed on September 5 and the health department was informed on September 7.

Once a possible outbreak is detected, a specific diagnosis is required to assess whether an outbreak has occurred. Since 1999, the New York City Department of Health has been monitoring and evaluating emergency medical service calls on a daily basis to identify an increase in respiratory illnesses that might represent an infectious disease outbreak (Mostashari et al., 2003). This is also the recommended method to detect possible intentional outbreaks due to bioterrorism (CDC, 2003). Data sources used often already exist but have not been designed specifically for public health surveillance purposes. An example is the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which contains coded health information from physician visit records. Data abstracted from emergency department logs or 911 calls can also be used through analysis of text or other developed coding systems (Pavlin et al., 2003). In the case of a chemical agent, unexplained deaths among young or healthy persons or emission of unexplained odors by patients could indicate an outbreak.",

            "text": "Laboratory tests also play an important role. Cases are not always geographically clustered and for that reason are not always easily linked to an outbreak. The CDC and several state health departments established PulseNet, a molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance to facilitate the detection and investigation of foodborne outbreaks (Swaminathan et al., 2001). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of DNA from bacterial isolates are submitted to the national database and can help link apparently unrelated cases that are geographically dispersed. Though PulseNet can detect clusters of potentially related organisms, epidemiologic assessment is required to determine if the cluster contributes to an outbreak. PulseNet laboratories operate in public health departments in all 50 US states and several national health and agriculture agencies. Most foodborne outbreaks are related to a local contamination such as in a restaurant, but a significant number are due to a wide distribution of food contaminated at various points of production. An example is an Escherichia coli O157 outbreak in 1992 linked with contaminated hamburgers that made more than 500 persons sick in 4 days and caused the deaths of 4 children (CDC, 1993). It took 39 days for the public health system to recognize it as an outbreak and another 10 days to investigate and institute a recall of the contaminated meat. PulseNet can now increase the sensitivity of outbreak detection in many instances. For example, in September 2006, state and CDC officials were able to detect and link multiple small clusters of E. coli O157:H7 infections across the United States within days using PulseNet information. This allowed investigators to rapidly identify fresh spinach as the source of infection (CDC, 2007b). More than 200 cases were detected in 26 states and Canada (Figure 4\n).",

This core team should establish a hierarchy for decision and information sharing. They should then create objectives for the investigation and develop plans for reevaluating the objectives as the investigation evolves. It is important to delineate roles and responsibilities for the relevant agencies and to agree on a timeline for reevaluating those roles. A lead agency and principal investigator should be identified. In the case of a large, complex outbreak, the need for additional human resources also has to be discussed. A list of types of expertise (e.g., epidemiologic, laboratory, statistical, communications) is required and availability of experts should be made known so that any gaps in expertise can be filled.",

For weeks the New York Bioterrorism Response Laboratory (BTRL) was overwhelmed by the increasing number of environmental samples. To deal with the situation, a laboratory bioterrorism command center was established, and protocols for sample intake, processing, reporting, security, testing, staffing, and quality control were developed (Heller et al., 2002). The specimen load increased from 1 every 2\u20133 months to 2700 nasal swabs in 2 weeks and 3200 environmental specimens in 2 months.

This was done during a multicluster outbreak in Massachusetts. Between February 2003 and May 2004, 10 outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness among schoolchildren at nine different schools were reported to the Department of Public Health (Shaffzin et al., 2006). All the children ate lunch provided by the schools and the disease was characterized by short incubation periods and short durations of illness. Based on prior investigations, a biotoxin or chemical agent was suspected. An environmental investigation identified three distributors who provided the schools with tortillas of different sizes and under various brand names but from one manufacturer. Several deficiencies at the plant were noted such as improper storage, use, and labeling of chemicals and food ingredients and additives, and food contact surfaces were not protected from environmental contamination. Samples were collected and analyzed. After the manufacturer was informed about the suspected cause of the outbreak, the recipe was changed and the amount of calcium propionate and potassium bromate used was lowered (Shaffzin et al., 2006).",

Recalled apple juice grew E. coli O157:H7 with the same PFGE pattern as those from the case isolates. The magnitude and severity of this outbreak led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to propose two new regulations (Troxell, 2005). First, all unpasteurized fruit and vegetable juices would have to carry a label stating, \u201cWarning: this product has not been pasteurized and therefore may contain harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness in children, elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems.\u201d The second regulation is the application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles to fruit and vegetable juice processing (see Relevant Websites). A HACCP program is a systematic method of identifying key production steps in which contamination may occur and instituting specific monitoring and interventions, such as pasteurization, at those steps.",

The epi curve shown in Figure 7\nreveals a peak in onset of disease around January 30 and a median incubation time of 32 h. Investigation showed that more than 360 restaurant patrons became ill after eating in the restaurant on two consecutive days (CDC, 2007a). If there is person-to-person transmission, each case can cause more cases, shown on the curve as a series of successive peaks. In 1997, passengers and crew members on a cruise ship developed acute respiratory illnesses possibly due to influenza (Miller et al., 2000).

If the exposure to the factor is the same in the two groups, it is unlikely that that factor caused the outbreak-related event. A case\u2013control study requires fewer financial and human resources. This design is also better if multiple exposures are related to the outbreak. The measure of association between exposure and disease is quantified by an odds ratio, that is, the ratio of the odds of a certain outcome. It is often used as an approximation for the relative risk. Using the data layout and notation mentioned above:Oddsratio=ad/bc\n",

            "text": "An important activity in designing a case\u2013control study is the selection of controls. Controls provide information about the estimated exposure that is expected in the studied population if the exposure was not related to the illness in question. Controls must be selected independently from their exposure status, representative of the population in question, and should have the potential to be exposed to the risk factor without having the disease in question. An example is a large hepatitis A outbreak that occurred among patrons in a Pennsylvania restaurant (Wheeler et al., 2005). For the case\u2013control study, 240 cases, as many as could be interviewed in a 2-week time period, were included. The 130 controls included meal companions of patients or persons who were identified through credit card receipts as having dined in the restaurant during a certain time period. Controls were excluded if they reported having symptoms or a history of acute hepatitis A or were vaccinated for hepatitis A. In March 2003, a nosocomial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in a hospital in Singapore (Teleman et al., 2004). To investigate factors associated with the transmission of SARS, a case\u2013control study was conducted with 36 cases and 50 controls. The controls were selected among health-care workers working in the same ward as the cases, but who did not develop the disease although they had a history of exposure (exposure defined as being within close physical proximity (1 m) of a patient subsequently confirmed with SARS).",

A very small p-value means that the chances of finding relative risk due to chance alone are very small.
