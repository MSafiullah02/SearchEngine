Please note that, during the production process, errors may be discovered which could affect the content, and all legal disclaimers that apply to the journal pertain. We agree that the stress and risk is common among the medical personnel who work hard during the COVID-19 outbreak. In our country, Thailand (the second country in the timeline of COVID-19 pandemic), the medial personnel usually lack knowledge and there is insufficient medical protective devices. There is also no specific mental health support for medical workers. How to support local people during the COVID-19 crisis might be mentioned (Xiao et al., 2020 ) the specific support for medical personnel is usually overlooked. Xiao et al. (2020) noted that levels of anxiety among medical staff caring patients with COVID-19 was dependent on sleep quality and social support [3] . A proper support to medical workers during the crisis is neccessary.",
