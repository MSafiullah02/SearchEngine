It may be argued that the most important result of this paper is that, these disorders are more prevalent in non-members of medical teams than in frontline healthcare professionals.",

In this paper the authors declared the urgent need of studied staffs to interventions related to their mental status . In another study by JZ et al. the mental health of 230 medical staff in a tertiary infectious disease hospital for COVID-19 was reported. The researchers concluded that, during COVID-19 epidemic, the incidence of anxiety and stress disorder is prevalent among participants (Huang et al., 2020) . In a recent study, Nursing Staff in Wuhan city during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak was studied in terms of their mental parameters . Also Due to lack of required personal protective equipment in Iran, frontline healthcare professionals despite of having good knowledge about COVID-19 have not had a good situation both physically and mentally (Nemati et al., 2020; Takian et al., 2020) . So in this situation a national study, suggested psychological interventions specially for medical staffs (Shojaei and Masoumi, 2020) . Almost all of the results are contrary to Li et al. study . The bad situation of the frontline staffs in comparison to the general public in terms of mental parameters was also repeated in previous infectious epidemic (Park and Park, 2020) .",

This heterogeneity can distort the results of Table 2 . When the existing experimental units are not homogeneous, grouping the experimental units into blocks of homogeneous units reduces the variance of the experimental error as well as the range of validity for inference about therapeutic effects. This is valid when the confounding variables are qualitative and this is known as the random block model. This model can be used in this article to adjust the gender, hospital, Departments, Professional titles, Marriage and Single-child variables .",
