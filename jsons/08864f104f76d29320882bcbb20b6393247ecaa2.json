We show that the viral infection regulates the abundance and/or subcellular localization of 3211 proteins during early infection. In total, 23 cellular proteins in the cytoplasmic proteome and 34 in the nuclear proteome were significantly altered after virus infection. These differentially abundant proteins are involved in such biological processes as immune response, signal transduction, RNA processing, macromolecular biosynthesis, energy metabolism, virus binding, and cellular apoptosis. Moreover, transcriptional profiles of the 25 genes corresponding to the identified proteins were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis clustered the differentially abundant proteins primarily into the mTOR pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, and interferon-\u2424 signaling cascades.

IBDV has a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome (segments A and B) [2] . The large ORF of the segment A encodes a polyprotein that can undergo cotranslational self-proteolytic processing and release three polypeptides, the precursor capsid protein (pVP2), the protease VP4 and the multifunctional polypeptide VP3. The small ORF in segment A encodes a nonstructural protein VP5 with a molecular weight of 17 kDa. Segment B contains a single ORF encoding the RdRp VP1 polypeptide.

However, mRNA is not always the same with the protein level. Consequently, potential cellular factors involved in viral infection are more likely obtained from the proteomic profile of the host cellular response. Now, large-scale screening is well recognized to be very effective for identifying host proteins of interest, many of which are unexpected and may lead to new discoveries regarding the host-virus interactions after additional functional validation.
