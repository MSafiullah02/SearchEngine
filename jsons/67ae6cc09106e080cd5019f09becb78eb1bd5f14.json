Although tremendous gains have been made for older adults with MM, infections, including respiratory infections, significantly impact the rate of early mortality in these patients [6, 7] . Furthermore, older adults with MM have age-associated vulnerabilities leading to heterogeneity in outcomes [8] . The complexity of caring for older patients have increased substantially during this pandemic, due to concern about their risk of severe morbidity of COVID19 infection. Optimal strategies for these patients will involve staging the malignancy/aging, while simultaneously considering the local prevalence of COVID-19 infection. Herein, we discuss strategies for the risk reduction of COVID-19 transmission, treatment stratification of anti-myeloma therapy and discussion regarding goals of care for older adults with MM during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Early estimates from China suggest an overall case fatality rate of 2%, increasing to 8% for those aged 70-79 years and 15% for those \u226580 years of age [1] . Recent estimates from an Italian series of 1591 patients admitted to the intensive care unit demonstrated that older adults (n = 786; age \u226564 years) had higher mortality compared to younger patients (n = 795; age \u226463 years) (36% vs 15%; difference, 21%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] , 17%-26%; P < .001) [9] . Similarly, in the United States, during March 1-28, 2020, laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate was 4.6 per 100,000 population with the highest rates among adults aged \u226565 years [10] . Increased number of overall comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, accounted for the majority of severe COVID-19 infections and associated deaths [3, 10, 11] .",

Oncology providers will need to engage in effective communication strategies regarding decision-making for both individual treatment trajectory as well as end-of-life conversations. Alternative and innovative methods of communication may need to be employed, such as multi-person video conferencing, to decrease the burden of social isolation by ensuring caregivers and other loved ones can participate during these difficult discussions.
