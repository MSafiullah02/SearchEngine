As of February 24th, 41600 medical staff across the country have been fighting in the front line of the anti-epidemic campaign. Of these medical staff, 3387 of them were infected with the novel coronavirus pneumonia, accounting for 4% of all confirmed cases, while 22 were killed and accounted for 0.8% of the deaths. The front-line medical staff will not only bear the work pressure of overload, but also face the huge risk of infection (2). Stress represents the main environmental risk factor for psychiatric illnesses, and in a long-term stress state, people can be more prone to depression or other mental disease (3), which will also increase the risk of infection (4\u20136). Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the psychological state of the first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and give them necessary psychological interventions if they have anxiety or depression.",

The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) 18 years or older; 2) doctor or nurse; 3) first-line to COVID-19; 4) without serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia or an intellectual disability; 5) without physical disease affecting anxiety or depression, such as hypothyroidism or coronary heart disease; and 6) willing to be investigated. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) less than 18 years old, 2) non-frontline medical or administrative staff, 3) not in Gansu, 4) serious mental illness or a combination of disorders that may affect anxiety or depression, and 5) refused to be investigated. Finally, 165 front-line medical staff working in the Wuhan isolation ward were enrolled in the study.",

Both SAS and SDS are 20-item Likert and norm-referenced scales, in which items tap physiological and psychological symptoms and are rated by participants according to how each applied to them within the past week, using a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (none, or a little of the time) to 4 (most, or all of the time) (9). The choice of SAS items is based on diagnostic criteria listed in the major American psychiatry literature, whereas the SDS taps depressive symptoms based on factor analytic studies of depression symptoms (9). The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety/Depression Scale (SAS/SDS) has been widely applied in clinical institutions and scientific research, showing convincing results and a remarkable degree of consensus among clinicians (10). According to the conclusion of other studies (11), we also utilized the standard score of 50 as the critical value to divide depression or anxiety in the present study. The Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) (12) is a 20-item self-report scale that includes two dimensions. The first entry consists of 1\u201312 items and reflects the traits of passive coping and active coping (8-item). The second entry consists of 13\u201320 questions, reflecting the traits of passive coping. This instrument has been commonly used in China and has proven to be highly reliable and valid (13).",

(17) found that 27% of junior doctors were suffering from depression, while 28.7% were suffering from anxiety. Paiva CE et al. (18) found that 12.3%of doctors had depression (HADS-D \u2265 11), and 19.4% had anxiety (HADS-A \u2265 11). A systematic review of 29 studies showed that the prevalence of anxiety and depression among students in medical schools in Europe, the UK, and elsewhere in the English-speaking world outside of North America was 7.7-65.5% and 6.0-66.5%, respectively (19). Similarly, a cross-sectional survey showed that the prevalence of anxiety symptoms in nurses was 43.4% (20). Another cross-sectional survey indicated that the prevalence rate of anxiety among female nurses was 41.1% (21). Maharaj S et al. (22) found that the prevalence rates of depression and anxiety among Australian nurses were 32.4% and 41.2%, respectively. So, our conclusions were not consistent, and this difference might come from the use of different investigation tools. Interestingly, we found that the anxiety level (X2 = 7.019. p=0.011) of nurses was significantly higher than that of doctors, but there was no difference in depression (X2 = 0.108. p=0.756) between the two groups. So we need to pay more attention to nurses in order to relieve their anxiety.",

There is considerable discourse surrounding the disproportionate diagnosis of men with depression as compared to women, often times cited at a rate around 1:2 (23). However, the view that depression rates are universally higher in women is challenged, as biological determinants, sex role changes, and social factors might also contribute to this difference (24). What's more, meta-analyses of diagnoses and symptoms show that the gender difference peaks in adolescence but then will decline and remain stable in adulthood, and cross-national analyses also indicate that larger gender differences are found in nations with greater gender equity for major depression, but not depression symptoms (25). But beyond that, a systematic review of nineteen studies indicates that the male gender is significantly associated with suicide in individuals with depression (26). So, the relationship between gender and depressive symptoms needs to be verified by a large-scale longitudinal study.",
