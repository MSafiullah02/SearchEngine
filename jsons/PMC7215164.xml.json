After the infection of more than 120.000 people and the death of almost 5.000, the World Health Organization announced it as a global controllable pandemic\n[2]. In April of 2020, the number of cases exceeded 2 million and the infection was spread over more than 180 countries[3], [4]. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were on the origin of not only the current pandemic, but also of the SARS and MERS epidemics, which infected and took the lives of thousands of people[5], [6]. Virologic and genetical studies confirmed that bats have been transmission hosts for both of the viruses , which were further spread by civets and dromedaries [7], [8], [9]. Recent studies suggest that specific types of animals can be the source of different coronaviruses: bats for alpha- and beta-CoVs, avian for gamma- and delta-CoVs, and rodents for the ancestor of the beta-CoVs lineage A[10], [11], [12].Table 1.\n",

The animal origin of the novel coronavirus led to a discussion about the possible transmission of the disease by contact with pets. A common fear that raised even more after the confirmation of the SARS-CoV2 in a tiger in the Bronx zoological garden[14]. The World Health Organization faced those concerns stating the lack of evidence on the spreading of the novel coronavirus from pet animals to people[15].",

Anecdotal evidence try to persuade that veterinary doctors are rarely affected with COVID-19. Doctor Sabina Olex-Condor, a Spanish physician in Madrid, suggested in an interview that the mild course is more frequent in patients owning pets (available at: www.vetnolimits.com; www.psy.pl; www.plus.gloswielkopolski.pl;). The correlation between pet-ownership and the presence of a mild course of COVID-19 has not been found yet. In our study, we conducted a review of the literature, trying to establish a possible explanation to this observation. We suggest that the re-emerging contact with animal coronaviruses may lead to the stimulation of the immunological system, thus creating an effective response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Feline coronaviruses are also detected in cats, but their symptoms are mainly related to the gastrointestinal tract or are causative agent of uncommon and usually fatal, aberrant immune response to viral infection, but transmission animal-to-human is highly limited[17].",

The analysis showed that the resemblance of the whole sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and Canine Respiratory Coronavirus (CrCoV) is 36.39% (comparing the protein GI QHR63290 to QAY30030). However, further investigation of the epitope sequence shows the high homology: 57.14%, 80.00%, 83.33%, and 100.00% in CrCoV epitopes: 789-799, 754-764, 424-437, and 1139-1152, respectively. Based on the data, we suggest that recurrent contact with animal coronaviruses may lead to immunization. This effect was confirmed by the experimental studies.
