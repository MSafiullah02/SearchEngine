Aside from maintaining proteostasis by degrading damaged or unwanted proteins, ubiquitination and subsequent degradation regulates the activity of many short\u2010lived proteins, including cell cycle regulators and transcription factors, and produces antigenic peptides for presentation on the cell surface 1, 2. Ubiquitination also has many proteasome\u2010independent roles, including regulating DNA damage repair, receptor endocytosis, and inflammation 3. Not surprisingly, dysregulation of the UPS contributes to many illnesses, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and immunological disorders.",

Ub is attached to substrates through its terminal glycine residue, a process referred to as ubiquitination (or ubiquitylation) 4. Typically, Ub is attached to proteins via an isopeptide bond to a lysine side chain, but proteins may also be ubiquitinated on their N terminus via a peptide bond. Ub itself can be ubiquitinated (polyubiquitination), giving rise to Ub chains 5. This can occur through one of seven Lys residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) or the N\u2010terminal Met residue (M1). K48\u2010linked polyubiquitination is the best\u2010known and most\u2010studied modification, as it targets proteins to the proteasome for degradation 6.

Ub conjugation requires the sequential action of three classes of enzymes (Fig. 1B). E1 enzymes initially activate free ubiquitin in a two\u2010step mechanism. In the first step, the E1 enzyme binds Ub and ATP, and catalyzes Ub C\u2010terminal acyl\u2010adenylation to form E1:Ub~AMP. (The tilde [~] is used to indicate a reactive covalent bond, while the colon [:] indicates a noncovalent complex.) In the second step, Ub is transferred onto a Cys residue to form a thioether linkage (E1~Ub). Activated Ub is next transferred to the Cys residue of a Ub\u2010conjugating (sometimes referred to as Ub\u2010carrier) enzyme, E2, to give E2~Ub. E2s, together with Ub ligases (E3), then transfer Ub to the substrate. E3s confer substrate specify to the E2 enzymes. The cullin\u2010RING ligases, which are the largest group of E3s, do not form a covalent bond to Ub. However, two smaller groups, the HECT ligases (~ 30 members) and RBR ligases (~ 12 members) accept Ub from E2s to form a Ub\u2010thioester (E3~Ub), which then transfers Ub to a substrate 13, 14.",

Many proteases are secreted in inactive forms and must undergo activation, either irreversibly (e.g., by proteolysis) or reversibly (e.g., by phosphorylation, formation of complexes with other proteins, pH change, or change in localization). Protein expression, as indicated by western blot or proteomics techniques, cannot therefore be used reliably to infer enzyme activity. Turnover of the natural substrate provides a direct measurement of activity but requires detection of the reaction products, which may be challenging in a complex cellular environment. Additionally, different enzymes often process the same substrate, making it difficult to assign activity to a particular enzyme. Activity\u2010based probes (ABPs) mimic substrate, but rather than being processed by the enzyme, they become covalently attached to the active site in an enzyme\u2010catalyzed reaction. As ABPs do not react with inactive enzymes, the extent of probe labeling is an indirect measure of enzyme activity. ABPs are particularly well suited for studying enzymes with nucleophilic catalytic residues, as a reactive electrophile can be incorporated into the probe to react covalently with the nucleophile. Consequently, cysteine, threonine, and serine proteases have been extensively studied with ABPs 23.",

To study the activity of specific DUBs, investigators frequently take advantage of the ~ 10 kDa increase in MW on probe labeling: by blotting for an individual DUB, and comparing the intensities of the larger (labeled) band to the smaller (unlabeled) band, the reactivity of the DUB toward the probe can be inferred. Affinity purification employing the epitope tag can be used to enrich labeled proteins, facilitating detection and identification of DUBs. The purified DUBs can be digested in solution and identified by tandem MS 51, or initially resolved by SDS/PAGE followed by in\u2010gel digestion and MS identification 32. In\u2010solution digestion procedures have the advantage of improved quantitation and detection of low\u2010abundance proteins, but require more complex analysis. A review of MS proteomic techniques in UPS research has been published recently 52.",

McGouran et al. introduced probes containing a fluorophore (Cy5 or fluorescein) at the C terminus. In\u2010gel fluorescence gave better resolution of labeled proteins than anti\u2010HA immunoblotting, particularly for high MW proteins, as no transfer step is necessary prior to visualization, but the probe was somewhat less reactive than unmodified HA\u2010Ub\u2010VME. This was attributed to the size and charge of the fluorophore, which is positioned close to the DUB active site 53. By contrast, probes with an N\u2010terminal fluorophore, as reported by de Jong et al. 54, showed the same activity toward DUBs as unmodified HA\u2010Ub\u2010VME. These N\u2010terminal conjugates were prepared by total chemical synthesis, allowing great flexibility in the choice of modification: a variety of dyes (Cy5 and TMR), affinity tags (HA, His6, and biotin), and linkers (aminohexanoic acid, lysine, and photocleavable linker) could be incorporated by this method. Additionally, dual\u2010function probes were prepared, for example, containing both a biotin (for affinity purification of labeled DUBs) and a Cy5 (for fluorescence imaging). Claessen et al. devised an alternative strategy for N\u2010terminal functionalization, which used \u2018sortagging\u2019 (i.e., sortase\u2010mediated ligation between appropriately tagged protein/peptide fragments) to introduce a biotin label.

Studies on substrate selectivity have used di\u2010Ub 82, or more recently, di\u2010Ub\u2010based ABPs with an internal electrophile (structure 5, Table 2) 83, 84. These substrates allow analysis of S1\u2013S1\u2032 preferences, but do not provide any information on the effect of S2 sites (Fig. 2A). Flierman et al. used di\u2010Ub ABPs with a terminal electrophile (structure 6, Table 2) in combination with di\u2010Ub substrate probes with a terminal fluorophore to study the effect of S2 sites 67. They observed significant differences between S1\u2013S1\u2032 and S1\u2013S2 selectivity for OTU DUBs. For example, OTUD2 is fairly promiscuous in cleaving di\u2010Ub substrates, but shows a preference for the K11\u2010linked di\u2010Ub terminal ABP, suggesting that the S2 pocket refines the selectivity of this DUB toward K11\u2010linked chains. OTUD3 can cleave both K6 and K11\u2010linked di\u2010Ub, but only reacts with the K11 di\u2010Ub probe. Kinetic studies using di\u2010Ub substrate probes (di\u2010Ub\u2010AMC) suggested that the selectivity of OTUD2 for longer K11\u2010linked chains is driven by affinity (lower KM), while for OTUD3, it appears to be driven by vmax, hinting that binding of K11 chains to OTUD3 may optimally reorganize the active site for catalysis. As the authors note, different selectivities across the S1\u2013S1\u2032 and S1\u2013S2 sites suggest that the preferred endogenous substrates for these DUBs may be heterotypic chains. Testing this hypothesis will require the development of tri\u2010Ub reagents with mixed linkage types.",

Some of the first studies employing DUB APBs profiled DUB activity in tumor, normal, and virus\u2010infected cells 87, and in pairs of normal and tumor biopsies from cervical carcinoma patients 88. However, identifying consistent changes in the patterns of DUB activity was challenging, and the biological significance of the observed differences was unclear. Other studies have taken a more focused approach: applying a stimulus to cells, monitoring changes in DUB activity, identifying DUBs with large changes in activity, then validating their role in the system of interest. A notable example of this strategy is the identification of USP7 as a regulator of adipogenesis 89. HA\u2010Ub\u2010VS was used to monitor changes in DUB activity in an in vitro adipogenesis model, which identified a substantial increase in USP7 activity. Further experiments confirmed that USP7 was required for adipogenesis, and that it exerted its effect through the deubiquitniation and stabilization of the acetyltransferase Tip60, a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation.",

As ABPP measures endogenous DUB activity, it avoids the problems introduced by artificially overexpressing or reducing gene expression, such as changes in viability or off\u2010target effects. ABPP also has the advantage of experimental simplicity, as no transfection is required and DUB activity is measured in a single experiment, either a gel\u2010based assay or tandem MS. However, the activity of many DUBs may change between experimental and control conditions, and identifying those that are functionally relevant can be challenging.

This closely parallels the use of Ubal to obtain Ub\u2010bound DUB structures, prior to the development of DUB ABPs. In an elegant study, Olsen et al. developed a SUMO~AMP mimic to trap the tetrahedral intermediate (E1~SUMO~AMP) formed by the catalytic Cys residue (Fig. 4A) 107. In this compound, SUMO1\u2010AVSN, the acyl\u2010phosphate linkage of SUMO1~AMP is replaced with a vinyl sulfonamide. They also developed an unreactive SUMO~AMP mimic incorporating an unreactive acyl\u2010sulfamide (SUMO1\u2010AMSN). Structures of SUMO E1 bound to the two compounds revealed major differences in protein architecture. The initial E1:SUMO\u2010AMSN complex adopts an \u2018open\u2019 conformation, in which the active site is organized for ATP binding and the catalytic Cys is buried and far from the SUMO adenylate. By contrast, the covalent complex E1~SUMO\u2010AVSN adopts a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation with a radically different active site: residues involved in catalyzing the first step have been \u2018swapped\u2019 for those required for the transesterification reaction. Therefore, E1 enzymes appear not to have two spatially distinct active sites; rather, the region around the SUMO C terminus and AMP is remodeled after the adenylation reaction in order to catalyze transesterification. These synthetic SUMO adenylate mimics were vital for crystallizing the E1 enzymes in otherwise transient states, illuminating the complex dynamics of these enzymes during catalysis. Similar probes will also react with and inhibit Ub E1 enzymes 108.",

To overcome these limitations, An and Statsyuk developed an alternative probe design which used a dehydroalanine (Dha) moiety in place of a vinyl sulfone to trap the catalytic Cys, simplifying synthesis and preserving the C\u2010terminal sequence of the Ubl (\u2018Ub\u2010Probe3\u2019, Fig. 4A) 109.

The probe, referred to as ABP1 (Fig. 4B), takes advantage of the reversibility of the transthiolation step, in which the E1:AMP~Ub complex transfers Ub to the catalytic Cys to form E1~Ub + AMP (Fig. 1B). The authors designed an AMP mimic which would react with the E1~Ub complex to form a stable AMP~Ub analog. As both the adenylation and transthiolation steps must have occurred prior to probe reaction, formation of the AMP~Ub analog reports on E1 activity. ABP1 is an analog of pevonedistat (MLN4924), an inhibitor of the NEDD8 E1 enzyme NAE which is currently in clinical trials 110 (Fig. 4B). ABP1 differs from pevonedistat in showing pan\u2010E1 reactivity, and additionally includes an alkyne for detection or enrichment (though \u2018click\u2019 reactions to fluorophore\u2010azide or biotin\u2010azide, respectively). The probe will react with a variety of E1 enzymes in vitro, in the presence of their cognate Ub/Ubl protein and ATP. Significantly, ABP1 is cell\u2010permeable, and was used to characterize the intracellular potency and selectivity of E1 inhibitors. A close analog of ABP1, ABP3, selectively labeled Ub and NEDD8 over other Ubls, suggesting selectivity toward the Ub and NEDD8 E1 enzymes 111. An unexpected advantage of these probes is that the N\u2010acylsulfamate linker, formed between the Ub/Ubl and the probe, is cleaved under acidic conditions. This facilitates subsequent proteomic studies, as proteins can be eluted under relatively mild conditions after biotin\u2013streptavidin affinity purification, reducing background from nonspecifically bound proteins 112, 113.",

The covalent nature of the intermediate makes the HECT and RBR E3s suitable candidates for the development of ABPs. Only recently have the first ABPs for the transthiolation step been described 115, which build on the E2\u2010derived probes for E1\u2010E2 transthiolation described above 114. In those probes, the E2 active site was modified to trap cognate E1 enzymes, but they did not react with E3s, which additionally require E2\u2010bound Ub to activate E3 enzymes for transthiolation. Pao et al. extended these probes with a Ub moiety to generate an E2~Ub conjugate with an internal electrophile (Fig. 4C). For ease of detection, the E2 enzyme could be prepared with a His6 epitope tag and an alkyne tag, allowing conjugation to a fluorophore for rapid detection of labeled species by in\u2010gel fluorescence. A UBE2L3\u2010containing probe labeled the E3 ligase parkin, a member of the RBR family encoded by the PARK6 gene, which is mutated in an autosomal\u2010recessive form of Parkinson's disease (PD). The authors tested the transthiolation activity of recombinant parkin mutants derived from patients with PD, and found that 10 of 12 mutants tested had reduced transthiolation activity. The probes were also used to investigate parkin activation in cells. Mitochondrial depolarization activates the kinase PINK1 (encoded by PARK6), which in turn activates parkin. In cells derived from PD patients with mutations in PARK2 or PARK6, chemical induction of mitochondrial depolarization did not activate parkin (as detected by probe labeling), in contrast to the activation observed in wild\u2010type cells. While the number of samples tested here was small, this observation suggests the possibility of using these probes to diagnose familial forms of PD in which the PINK1/parkin pathway is mutated.",

Studies on the proteasome have shown substantial differences between labeling in lysate and labeling in live cells. Cell\u2010permeable DUB and E1\u2010E3 ABPs would open up substantial new opportunities, including the exciting possibility of studying the activity of these enzymes in living organisms. Ward et al. have recently reported a cell\u2010permeable ABP for USP DUBs by modifying a covalent DUB inhibitor 31, and this approach could be extended by attaching reporter tags to other inhibitors 104, 106.Subtype selectivity of DUB probes. Broad\u2010spectrum DUB probes are extremely useful for ABPP experiments, but more selective probes would be useful to study a single enzyme or small subset of enzymes, for example, when examining the pharmacodynamics of a DUB inhibitor. Substrate\u2010selective DUB probes are likely to have increased sensitivity, and deconvolution of individual proteins becomes unnecessary. Selective small molecules or engineered Ub variants 116, 117 could provide suitable recognition elements.M1\u2010linked di\u2010Ub probes. There is an increasing interest in M1\u2010linked chains and their corresponding deubiquitinases, which have important roles in inflammation 118, 119. ABPs for M1\u2010specific DUBs would be valuable tools for studying this physiologically intriguing linkage.Probes for JAMM/MPN+ DUBs. The JAMM/MPN+ family DUBs are zinc\u2010dependent metalloproteases, and so do not form a covalent intermediate with the substrate. It is therefore challenging to develop ABPs that become covalently attached to the enzyme. Several groups have reported strategies to develop ABPs for metalloproteases: Cravatt incorporated a photocrosslinker and alkyne tag into a metal\u2010chelating inhibitor 120, while we have introduced a Cys residue into the protein of interest that could react with an electrophile on the probe 121. Similar strategies could be applied to develop covalent ABPs for JAMM/MPN+ DUBs.E2 probes. Aside from the \u2018cascading\u2019 ABP reported by Mulder et al., there are no ABPs for E2 enzymes. E2\u2010based probes for the transthiolation activity of E1 and E3 enzymes have been described 114, 115 (Fig. 4C), and analogous probes based on E1 or E3 enzymes may be useful to study the transthiolation activity of E2s.Effect of post\u2010translational modification of Ub. Recent studies have shown that Ub can be modified by phosphorylation or acetylation, with significant biological consequences (reviewed in 122). However, the mechanisms by which these modifications affect the function of Ub are poorly understood. Synthetic and semisynthetic methods to produce homogeneously modified Ub or Ub chains have been reported 29 but have not yet been applied to ABPs. Probes for the Ub conjugation or deconjugation machinery incorporating defined modifications could provide insights into how modification of Ub affects its function.\n",
