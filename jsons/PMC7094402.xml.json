Because standard microbial culture methods do not isolate Mycoplasma spp., special laboratory methods are required for diagnosis (Wilson et al., 1992; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 1995; Gonz\u00e1lez and Wilson, 1997).",

Hutches were approximately 9 ft (3 m) apart, except that the control calves were separated from the mycoplasma-exposed calves by 80 feet (25 m). Control calves were bedded at least twice every day with mycoplasma-negative sand from a sand quarry, on top of straw. Exposed calves were bedded at least twice every day with sand previously identified as M. bovis-positive (Justice-Allen et al., 2010) on a dairy farm, on top of straw. The straw was added as needed for moisture absorption and comfort (more frequently in cold or wet weather); sand was added at least twice daily to maximize potential exposure of the exposed group to mycoplasma. The positive sand (18,000 kg) had been transported to Utah State University and was stored outdoors in a pile for 18 mo before the study reported here began. In a previous study, when the same sand pile was culture-positive for mycoplasma, the dose of M. bovis was always >200 cfu/g and usually ranged between 7,800 and 2,130,000 cfu/g (Justice-Allen et al., 2010).",

A laryngoscope was used to view the laryngeal folds, and a guarded mare sterile uterine catheter swab (33 in/84 cm) was passed through the folds until the tracheal bifurcation; the swab was passed through the guard, and then retracted, followed by retraction of the catheter. Anesthesia was reversed with i.v. tolazoline (Tolazine; Lloyd Inc., Shenandoah, IA); a beginning dose of 0.2 mg/kg was i.v. administered slowly and repeated if necessary until effective, when calves could stand.",

Bedding samples (an equal mixture of superficial and deep sites) were cultured as reported previously (Justice-Allen et al., 2010), using 1 g of bedding diluted in 1,000 mL of sterile water to make an initial 1,000-fold dilution. Three additional 1:10 dilutions were made, resulting in 1:104, 1:105, 1:106 dilutions. For all dilutions, 50 \u03bcL of sample was plated and counted to determine colony forming units per gram.

The PCR reaction mix consisted of 6.3 \u03bcL of a SYBR Green master mix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD), a fluorescent dye that binds to double-stranded DNA during the PCR reaction; 0.5 \u03bcL of each of the primers (at a concentration of 2.5 pmol/uL; forward, MYCP 3a and reverse, MYCP 4); and 5.2 \u03bcL of the diluted extracted DNA. The total volume of the PCR reaction mix was 12.5 \u03bcL. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 40 cycles of 55\u00b0C for 2 min and 72\u00b0C for 1 min followed by a continuous melt of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and 95\u00b0C for 15 s. There was no denaturization step at the beginning of the reaction. Each PCR plate contained positive (M. bovis, ATCC #25025; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and negative (DNA free water) PCR controls, as well as the extraction controls for the group of samples. The testing for each sample was run in triplicate.",

Each DNA band was then cut from the gel, and the DNA was extracted for sequencing using an extraction kit (Qiagen) for DNA in gel.

            "text": "Sensitivity for mycoplasma detection was estimated as 25% for nasal or ear swabs and 75% for tracheal swabs (Thomas et al., 2002; Marois et al., 2007). Therefore, the probability of a false negative test result was (1 \u2013 0.25) = 0.75 for each nasal/ear swab test, and (1 \u2013 0.75) = 0.25 for each tracheal swab test. For each calf, the probability of being detected positive by at least 1 diagnostic test if they truly became infected with mycoplasma beginning 4 wk after exposure to positive bedding sand was calculated. Because most calves are infected within 1 to 3 wk after exposure to mycoplasma, the assumption that 4 wk of exposure would be necessary before detectable disease resulted was a conservative estimate (Stipkovits et al., 1993; Catry et al., 2008). Sequential probability was used to calculate the probability of all test results for a given calf being falsely negative if the calf became infected (failure to detect a true positive animal at least once). Beginning 4 wk after exposure to positive bedding sand, false-negative probabilities of 0.75 for nasal/ear swab tests were multiplied, and false-negative probabilities of 0.25 for tracheal swab tests were multiplied. For example, 4 wk after calf 4 was exposed to mycoplasma-positive bedding, he was tested over the next 62 d with 7 weekly nasal/ear swabs and 2 monthly tracheal swabs; the probability of complete failure to detect infection if present was (0.75)(0.75)(0.75)(0.25)(0.75)(0.75)(0.75)(0.75)(0.25) = 0.008. The probability of detection by at least 1 positive test result if truly infected with mycoplasma = (1 \u2013 0.008) = 0.992 = 99.2%.",

In this study, mycoplasma-positive bedding was evaluated only for use with young calves, not lactating cows.

Intermittently positive culture results over time in the pile of sand used in this study had been observed previously as well; the earlier study found that mycoplasma was more likely to be recovered from the sand when the ambient temperature was between 15 and 20\u00b0C, and mycoplasma also was isolated on 2 occasions after the sand pile was moved, including the move to the location for the calf study reported here (Justice-Allen et al., 2010). Mycoplasma recovery from sand in the present study increased following the movement of the sand pile to the calf facility just before the start of the trial, and decreased and later ceased as colder winter temperatures arrived during the late weeks of the project. Nevertheless, the dose of Mycoplasma spp. found in the sand pile when it cultured positive during this experiment ranged between 200 and approximately 30,000 cfu/g. The infectious dose of M. bovis required for nasal transmission of disease to calves has not been demonstrated, but is presumed to be 100 cfu (Rosenbusch, 2003). Therefore, every ounce of mycoplasma-positive bedding sand was likely to contain between 120 and 18,000 times the proposed infectious dose for mycoplasmal calf disease. Conditions in the calf hutches in this study were like those on commercial farms, and failure of mycoplasma-positive sand to be associated with disease was probably not caused by insufficient dose of the organism.",
