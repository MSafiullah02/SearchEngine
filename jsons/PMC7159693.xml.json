Inclusion criteria included age between 18 and 80 years, ASA physical status I\u2013III and elective total knee replacement. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, history of head injury, core temperature \u226537.5 \u00b0C and contra\u2010indication to neuraxial blockade. Written consent for the study was obtained from each patient. Baseline data were collected and each patient's temperature was measured with an infrared tympanic thermometer (Thermoscan Pro 1, Braun, Germany) immediately after transfer to the operating table and hourly thereafter. Non\u2010invasive blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiography and pulse oximetry were applied. An intravenous catheter was placed and Hartmann's solution infused at 10 ml.kg\u22121 over 20\u201330 min and subsequently according to vital signs and blood loss. Combined spinal\u2010epidural (CSE) anaesthesia was performed by the investigators (VN or AL) at L3\u20104 or L4\u20105, using 0.5% plain bupivacaine intrathecally. The epidural catheter was left in situ and epidural morphine was given at the end of surgery for postoperative pain relief. A rectal thermistor temperature probe was then inserted and surgery started after an adequate level of anaesthesia was achieved. Rectal temperature was monitored continuously until the end of anaesthesia.",

A cotton blanket was folded once to make two layers in thickness, with the forced\u2010air warming blanket sandwiched between the two layers. It was then applied to cover the patient's anterior chest and both arms. Warming was started and continued until the end of surgery. The forced\u2010air warming unit temperature output was set to 43 \u00b0C. For the heating\u2010pad group, the 104 \u00d7 45 cm pad was placed on the operating table and a prewarmed gel pad was placed on top of it, as suggested by the manufacturer, covered in turn with a sheet. The patient warming system was set to a temperature of 39 \u00b0C and warming started 10 min before patients were transferred to the operating table.

However, cost is a concern: the disposable blankets available costs more than UK\u00a315 (\u20ac21; US$20) each and are not recommended for re\u2010use on another patient, the frequency of bacterial contamination tripling after single use [5]. Even if a brand new blanket is used on each patient, the problem is not eliminated. Avidan et al. sampled the air stream from nine forced\u2010air warming units and found potentially pathogenic organisms in four [4]. In another study, heavy growth of bacteria was found in swab samples taken from the exterior and interior of the warming unit and from the distal end of the hose [6]. These studies demonstrate that the hose and the warming units are potential sites for bacterial colonisation, probably due to difficulty in cleaning. This is of particular concern as resistant viruses such as the SARS coronavirus can live on inanimate surfaces for up to 24 h [9]. The electric heating pad used in the current study consists of a warming unit, an electric cable and a heating pad. The heating pad is water sealed and can be disinfected with alcohol or any other disinfectant, as suggested by the manufacturer. There is no hose or hidden space, and theoretically it is easier to clean and disinfect than forced\u2010air warming devices.",

            "text": "We found that the electric heating pad was as effective as forced\u2010air warming for maintaining intra\u2010operative body temperature. The drop in mean rectal temperature over the first 30 min of surgery in the forced\u2010air group, from 36.8 \u00b0C to 36.6 \u00b0C, could be explained by the redistribution of body heat from the core thermal compartment to the distal legs after induction of CSE anaesthesia [10]. The corresponding drop was slightly less in the heating pad group, from 36.9 \u00b0C to 36.8 \u00b0C. This might be because active warming had already started in the heating pad group once the patients were transferred to the operating table, and continued throughout the performance of the CSE. It is known that prewarming before induction of anaesthesia reduces the core\u2010to\u2010peripheral temperature gradient and reduces redistribution hypothermia [11]. Rectal temperature in the forced\u2010air group gradually increased from its nadir at 30 min. This gradual increase might be due to persistent vasoconstriction in the upper limbs [10], making forced\u2010air warming with an upper body blanket relatively less efficient. Rectal temperature was relatively stable in the heating pad group during the first hour of surgery and gradually increased above the baseline thereafter. Another factor to be considered is the body surface area available for warming. The upper body forced\u2010air warming blanket only covered the anterior chest and both arms. The electric heating pad used was 104 cm long and 45 cm wide, resulting in the entire back of the patient being warmed by the pad. In addition, the air under the surgical drape was being warmed, resulting in a tent\u2010like effect.",

            "text": "There are some limitations to our study. First, there was no control group (no active warming) to compare with the two warming strategies. However, we considered this unethical. In addition, we believe that active warming was achieved in both groups, as otherwise we would have expected the temperature drop in the forced\u2010air group to persist for 3 h and the rectal temperature to drop by about 1 \u00b0C [10], whereas in the heating pad group the rectal temperature would have been less stable. Second, there was a difference in the time at which the two warming devices were applied: the heating pad was switched on before the patient was transferred to the operating table, whereas the forced\u2010air warming blanket was applied only after induction of anaesthesia. We are not sure whether the temperature changes might have been different had the forced\u2010air warming started once the patients were transferred to the operating table and been continued throughout the performance of the CSE, but this would be difficult to achieve practically. Third, our study was limited to total knee replacement and we are uncertain whether the results can be extrapolated to other types of surgery. However, our results suggest that active warming with the electric heating pad should at least be considered as an alternative to forced\u2010air warming for maintenance of intra\u2010operative body temperature.",
