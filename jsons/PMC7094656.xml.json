For example, in 2002 and 2003, SARS caused over 8000 illnesses and 700 deaths, and there is still no adequate treatment (Yang, Lee, Chen, Wu, & Yu, 2007). The recent swine flu outbreak due to a new strain of H1N1 influenza A has caused illness in over 214 countries and resulted in 18311 deaths worldwide as of July 2010 (WHO, 2010). On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 6, indicating the onset of a global pandemic (CDC, 2009).",

This approach considerably decreases the incidence and severity of infection. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines about the use of face masks and respirators to protect against H1N1 transmission in healthcare facilities (CDC, 2009). However, using medical masks and N95 FFRs as countermeasures for bioaerosols has not been demonstrated to provide a complete response: (1) although using surgical masks and N95 FFRs for tuberculosis has been shown to meet CDC guidelines, the same is not true for viral agents such as the swine flu virus. (2) There is no experimental basis upon which the FFR\u2019s life span in an H1N1 scenario can be estimated. (3) The stockpile of FFRs will be exhausted in the event of a severe pandemic. CDC estimates that more than 90 million FFRs will be required for healthcare workers in the US if a pandemic influenza event persists for 42 days (CDRF, 2006).",

To qualify a method to decontaminate an FFR for reuse, one must provide a statistically robust demonstration that the technologies applied do not alter the mechanical properties of the FFR, do not leave any toxic byproduct on the FFR, and achieve at least four-log virucidal efficacy on the materials of construction of the FFR. However, no protocol has been reported for such decontamination testing, a consequence of two main limitations. First, no standard test method has been reported for simulating bioaerosol contamination of the FFRs. Second, the unique properties of bioaerosols generated by respiratory secretions can be expected to affect the efficacy of the decontamination process, and the window of operating conditions affording controlled and consistent properties is not known. Therefore, development and validation of methods that are representative of human respiratory secretions is a necessary condition before one can realistically evaluate techniques for decontamination.",

            "text": "Influenza is commonly thought to be transmitted by three mechanisms (droplet, contact, and aerosol (droplet nuclei)) (CDRF, 2006). Some diseases (e.g., tuberculosis) are known to be mainly transmitted by the droplet nuclei route, whereas droplet transmission is considered by many to be the dominant route for some other diseases (e.g., mumps), although the actual routes are still being debated (Fiegel et al., 2006, Tellier, 2006, Yang et al., 2007). Salgado, Farr, Hall, and Hayden (2002) suggested different roles in influenza between droplet and aerosol transmission. Influenza is mainly spread through droplet transmission by coughing and sneezing from infectious people, while aerosol transmission is important for long-distance and sporadic infection. An infected human can be a source of large droplets generated by coughing and sneezing. During airborne transmission, these droplets will shrink in size with the consequence that both droplets and droplet nuclei contact surfaces. Although many researchers have examined the droplet size generated from humans, the actual size is not clear. Yang et al. (2007) reported that most droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking have diameter between 1 and 20 \u03bcm, and these droplets may contract depending on the humidity and medium generated. Viruses in these droplets can aggregate with each other or be encased by the saliva component, both enhancing persistence of viability. Meanwhile, viability of viruses in saliva can be attenuated by an enzyme action (Diaz-Arnold & Marek, 2002). Therefore, it is important that the transmission medium be factored into the design of the test method.",

While the focus of this study was FFRs and a biosafety level (BSL)-I virus, the system was designed to be used with BSL-II microorganisms, which require advanced containment. This fact limited the overall size of the unit, due to the requirement for secondary containment of the test system. The system also has utility outside of FFRs and could be used to load any surface (e.g., a surgical scalpel or glove).",

The schematic design of the loading system is shown in\nFig. 1. The system consists of a chamber body, an ultrasonic generator (241 T, Sonear\u00ae, Farmingdale, NY) for producing the droplets, a bubbler for generating moisture, compressed cylinder air for controlling RH and diluting virus concentrations, an RH meter for measuring humidity, a six-port manifold for distributing the aerosols, a thermometer for measuring temperature, and six supports to hold the flexible-form FFRs during loading (Baron et al., 2008, Feather and Chen, 2003, Fisher et al., 2009). This system can also include a charge neutralizer (Model 3012, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN). The chamber body was fabricated from stainless steel sheet with welded seams to withstand the high temperature for sterilization. The turntable and six perforated sample plates were employed to increase uniformity of deposition. The particle size distributions (PSDs) were measured by an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS; Model 3321, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN) through a port on the side of the chamber.",

The difference among the six positions was not statistically significant (p=0.73) for flat-sheet glass-fiber filters. The reason for this uniformity is likely because settling is the dominant mechanism for large droplets in our system and a six-port distributor delivered the bioaerosols. A straight fog stream was observed through the front window during the loading. Therefore, the turntable speed was not an important parameter to meet the uniformity criteria when the flatsheet filter was employed.

The droplet size distributions at 4 and 5 Lpm were slightly shifted to a smaller diameter. Bimodal distribution was observed in the mass-based size distribution, with modes at 4\u20136 \u03bcm and over 20 \u03bcm. The theoretical CMD from the ultrasonic nebulizer can be determined from Eq. (2) (Lang, 1962)(2)dp(CMD)=0.73\u03c3\u03c1f23where d\np is the nebulized droplet size, \u03c3 is the surface tension of the liquid, \u03c1 is the density of the liquid, and f is the frequency of the nebulizer. As shown, the droplet size is independent of the flow rate. The gentle airflow within 1\u20133 Lpm just carries the aerosol away from the liquid surface. However, at a higher flow rate, the larger volume of dry dilution air promotes evaporation, and therefore results in a smaller droplet size. To generate droplets of other sizes, the frequency can be adjusted. For example, droplets are expected to be 12.1 and 6.6 times larger, respectively, when lower frequencies of 60 or 150 kHz are used instead of 2.4 MHz (Lang, 1962).",

For this condition, the cylinder air without a bubbler was applied to achieve the low-RH condition. The MMDs for droplets generated and loaded were 9.2 and 3.2 \u03bcm, respectively, with corresponding CMDs of 3.4 and 1.8 \u03bcm, which are similar to the droplet size reported in the literature (Yang et al., 2007, Morawska et al., 2009) to have been generated by humans. The droplet\u2019s residence time is 0.13 s when settling is considered the main mechanism acting in this chamber. The droplet\u2019s theoretical lifetime at 35% RH is around 0.15 s, which means that droplets just reaching the FFR are almost completely evaporated. The size of a completely evaporated droplet can be calculated according to Eq.

For 0.3% mucin, the volume fraction is 2.08\u00d710\u22122, so d\np is calculated to be 2.6 \u03bcm when d\nd is 9.2 \u03bcm.

Even for fixed-form FFRs, some inherently cannot produce equal quarters because the shape is not symmetric. Operational variation while cutting the sample (e.g., uneven quarters) can also contribute to larger CV values. Consequently, the CV for Q-T-Q was higher than that for S-T-S over all FFRs.

Different layer structures and properties of the FFRs are responsible for the differences as discussed. The shape of the FFR is another reason for differences in loading density. The loading density reported in Table 2 was calculated based on the FFR\u2019s projected area. The FFR, having a duck-bill shape, showed a lower loading density owing to its different curvature. As shown, both factors can affect loading density. Nevertheless, the loading density can be easily met in a controlled fashion using the specified conditions, and can be conveniently increased by adjusting the loading time, virus titer, or both.",

The droplet size can be altered by tuning the frequency of the ultrasonic nebulizer, by changing the composition of the dispersion aerosolized, and by adjusting the temperature and RH inside the chamber. Droplets emulating bioaerosols released during coughing and sneezing can be produced using specific conditions and the loading density can be achieved by controlling the loading time and the virus titer in the nebulization medium. This system allows for development and validation of a standard method for loading bioaerosol challenges when different decontamination techniques are to be compared. It also has utility for loading surfaces to study fomite transmission and reaerosolization of particles from surfaces. It can be further applied to generate and load droplets and aerosols of different sizes and to load onto materials other than FFRs.",
