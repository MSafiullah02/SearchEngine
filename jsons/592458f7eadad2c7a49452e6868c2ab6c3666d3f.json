Literature review with fixed search terms, up to 1 st April 2020. Central 22 tendency and variation of the parameter estimates for infectious period in (a) asymptomatic (b) 23 symptomatic cases from (i) virological studies (repeated testing), (ii) tracing studies (iii) modelling 24 studies were gathered. Narrative review of viral dynamics. 25 Information sources: Search strategies developed and the following searched: PubMed, Google 26 Scholar, MedRxiv, BioRxiv. Additionally, the Health Information Quality Authority (Ireland) viral load 27 synthesis was utilised, which screened literature from PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, NHS 28 evidence, Cochrane, medRxiv and bioRxiv, HRB open databases. 29",

There was a diversity of methods employed to 462 infer dynamics of infectiousness across studies, and therefore the evidential base was variable. Some 463 issues around nomenclature were noted, including definitions of asymptomatic, infectious period, 464 latent, and incubation period. It is possible the same data may have been used across different 465 studies, especially where publicly available data were used. 466",

High viral loads, measured as Ct values, have been recorded for one week 361 to 20 days post symptom onset, with a general decreasing trend with time.

The pre-484 symptomatic infectious phase (T3) is quite narrowly defined to a mean of approximately 2 days 485 (range: <1-4) within the literature. However, there is great uncertainty around the infectious period 486 from onset to recovery or death (T5 parameter). The symptom onset until clearance (based on two 487 negative RT-PCR tests) parameter estimate of 13.4 days (95%CI: 10.9-15.8) is informative for T5 488 parameter, only if one assumes that RT-PCR positive results equate to having infectious potential. 489 Many current models corral the infectious period to shorter time periods than what virological 490 studies have suggested, with one recent study suggesting that duration of viral detectability over-491 estimates the infectious period on average by 2-6 days. While viral RNA can be detected for long 492 periods of time, especially from faecal samples, the ability to isolate the virus ifrom nfected cases 493 quickly declines after one-week post-symptoms. Some modelling papers have assumed that 494 infectious period is invariant to whether cases are asymptomatic or symptomatic, however, the data 495 available are not yet rich enough to inform whether this is a good assumption. Similarly, it is not yet 496 established whether viral loads are similar between asymptomatic and mild, moderate, or severe 497 symptomatic cases, with conflicting reports in the literature. 498 Funding: All investigators are full-time employees (or retired former employees) of University 499 College Dublin, the Irish Department of Food and the Marine (DAFM), or the Irish Health Information 500 and Quality Authority (HIQA).

Current understanding of viral dynamics of infection 412 suggest that viral load and shedding increases during post-latent phase, peaking around onset [for 413 symptomatic cases], before declining.[29,50,53] This aspect of the natural history of infection may 414 be important when attempting to model transmission dynamics. 415 Length of infectious period in symptomatic cases that do not isolate (T5 parameter) has also been 416 rarely directly measured in the literature, as serial monitoring of patients in terms of symptoms or 417 viral load (rt-PCR) generally occurs after diagnosis and/or after admission to hospital [from a 418 modelling perspective, this means cases are censored as they are assumed to no longer contribute 419 to transmission]. If natural progression of infection after diagnosis or hospital admission mimics the 420 course of infection for those who do not isolate, the review of the literature describing time to two 421 clear tests is informative. Symptom onset to serial testing clearance [assessed the time to first of two 422 RT-PCR clear tests] averaged 13.4 days (95%CI: 10.9-15.8) from our meta-analysis. In the maximal 423 case, where patients succumb or fully recover from infection, time from symptoms to death or 424 discharge may be informative. Studies that collated such information suggest mean durations of 425 18.07 days (95%ci: 15.14 -20.99), but with time to discharge being 4.96 days shorter (95%CI: 2.15-426 7.76) on average than time to death. These values may represent an over estimation of the 427 infectious period; one study suggested that there was on average 2.5 days between end of 428 infectiousness and 'removal' (recovery or death).[37] 429 Cheng et al. [33] provided evidence of transmissibility, based on attack rate from primary to 430 secondary cases, at around symptom onset. The authors estimate cumulative infectiousness from 431 onset, which suggests that 67% of total infectiousness potential occurs by the first day post-onset. 432 Most of the total infectiousness occurs within 5 days (86.9%) post onset, with the remaining 433 infectiousness potential (13.1%) being distributed up to day 30 (this truncation is an assumption by 434 the authors). It is possible that pre-symptomatic transmission occurred during this study, but the 435 authors do not estimate what proportion of transmissions occurred during a pre-symptomatic 436 infectious period, or its potential duration. 437 A model by He et al. [29] is informative for overall symptomatic duration (T3+T5), using 77 infector-438 infectee pairs where COVID-19 transmission occurred in China. The study reported that 439",

Oral-faecal transmission risk is currently unknown, 450 but some doubt has been raised about studies that have reported positive RTPCR test results (see 451 [68]; but there may be some evidence of the risk amongst children; [69]). W\u00f6lfel et al. [50] has 452 produced an important study that provides some data on viral replication, and the site and duration 453 over which this may be taking place.
