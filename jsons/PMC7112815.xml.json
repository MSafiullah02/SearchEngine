            "text": "Influenza A virus is a member of the genus of Orthomyxoviridae RNA viruses. It is an important human pathogen and a cause of significant annual global morbidity and mortality. There is increasing and widespread concern on the possibility of the emergence of a pandemic strain of influenza (Lipatov et al., 2004). The M2 inhibitors were the first drugs to be used specifically against influenza A, in the mid-seventies. However, resistance to this drug emerges rapidly in vitro and in vivo, and the resistant strains appear to be fully pathogenic and transmissible (Hayden and Hay, 1992). Oseltamivir and zanamivir are neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), representing a more specific family of antiviral drugs, which are now licensed for prevention and treatment of influenza A and B (Gubareva et al., 2000, Hayden et al., 1997, Treanor et al., 2000). It was considered that this class of drug would be far less likely to promote the development of drug resistance because they interact with highly conserved residues in the viral neuraminidase (Burmeister et al., 1991, Taylor and von Itzstein, 1994). The global NAI Susceptibility Network, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO), was created to monitor the emergence of NAI-resistant viral mutants and has not found until recently any spontaneous resistance to NAIs, and very little emergence of resistance in treated patients (Zambon and Hayden, 2001). Surveillance in previous years have found <1% of circulating viruses to be resistant to oseltamivir and none to zanamivir (Monto et al., 2006). They usually occurred following treatment, but had not been shown to be readily transmissible and this was considered to be due possibly to decreased virus fitness (Carr et al., 2002, Colacino et al., 1997, Gubareva et al., 1997, Herlocher et al., 2004, Ives et al., 2002, Tai et al., 1998, Yen et al., 2005).",

However recently, surveillance studies have shown that a significant proportion of circulating viruses are presenting resistance to oseltamivir (Euro Surveill, 2008). Analysis of 2813 influenza A/H1N1 viruses from 24 European countries isolated between November 2007 and June 2008 showed that 701 were resistant to oseltamivir (mean 25%), but of those tested all samples analysed retained sensitivity to the alternative NAI, zanamivir (the E119 residue in NA1) and the M2 proton pump blocker amantadine (S31 in the M2 protein) (Euro Surveill, 2008). The studies to date have also shown considerable differences in the patterns of resistance in different geographical regions. There is no evidence that these influenza A/H1N1 viruses have arisen directly as a result of treatment by oseltamivir, which is currently not prescribed widely in most European countries. Global surveillance coordinated by the WHO has also subsequently found evidence of resistant viruses in North America and in the Far East. Clinical experience in Norway has suggested that individuals who become ill with an oseltamivir resistant strain of influenza A/H1N1 have a similar spectrum of illness to those infected with the wild-type seasonal influenza A (Euro Surveill, 2008).",
