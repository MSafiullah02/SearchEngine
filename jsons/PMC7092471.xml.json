            "text": "During the last 20 years, the fields of microbiology and infectious diseases have faced a paradigm shift thanks to the discovery of the complex interactions between the host, its immune system, its microbiome, and various pathogens. In fact, the development of various techniques, such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, has let scientists discover the inner structure of human genetic composition. The human microbiome has been defined as the collective genome of millions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that exists on every human host. It plays an elegant mutualistic relationship with the human host from birth [1]. Specifically, the human gastrointestinal tract contains trillions of bacteria that compose a complex ecosystem known as the intestinal microbiota that has relevant implications in human health and disease, especially in the hospital setting [2]. Resident microbiota can outcompete pathogens for space, metabolites and nutrients, and can inhibit pathogens with the calibration of the host immune response. Perturbation of these mechanisms is a common starting point for infection, with antibiotic therapy representing the most common cause of microbiome dysregulation [3].",

On the other hand, other studies have shown that the composition of the intestinal microbiota is severely affected by sepsis and its treatment, but the clinical consequences of these disturbances need to be further investigated. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the mechanisms through which gut microbiota can contribute to both susceptibility and outcome of sepsis.

            "text": "In general, the gut microbiota consists of three domains of life: bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. The human gut microbiota has a large variety of bacterial species\u2014around 200 dominant species and 1000 non-dominant species\u2014and they vary across individuals. The diversity within an individual\u2019s microbiota is known as alpha diversity, whereas different composition between individuals is called beta diversity. Four phyla represent most of the microbiota members: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, the former and the latter accounting for more than 90% of the bacterial population of the colon. The bacteroidetes phylum is composed of Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that digest complex polysaccharides with the release of volatile short-chain fatty acids that regulate intestinal epithelial cell growth as well as differentiation and stimulation of the immune system. The Firmicutes phylum is composed mainly of Gram-positive bacteria that can form endospores (Clostridia class). These bacteria release butyrate, promoting intestinal epithelial health and inducing colonic T regulatory cells. However, these phyla contain clinically relevant members such as Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. that can cause sepsis and fatal outcome during intestinal dysbiosis [2]. As the composition of the gut microbiota is specific for each person, dysbiosis can be interpreted as a relative change in the composition of an individual\u2019s commensal microbiota compared with others in the community, which can be loss of beneficial microbiota, increased pathogenic microbiota or decreased microbiota variety. Several mechanisms presenting during gut barrier dysfunction can be considered both a result and a cause of sepsis development: the increased permeability of gut mucosa, tissue edema, reduced perfusion, dysregulation of tissue coagulation, shift in the gut microbiome, apoptotic damage to the mucosal epithelia, and bacterial translocation. Gut mucosal perfusion is reduced during sepsis, which produces destruction of the mucosal barrier and increased permeability [4]. Transmigration of bacteria and endotoxin can induce relevant systemic effects, inducing an immune response in the local gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which in turn activates Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and priming neutrophils, causing remote lung injury, explaining the appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during sepsis [5]. The dysregulation between diverse resident bacterial populations in the gut can lead to a \u201cpathobiome\u201d that finally dysregulates the immune system [6] (Box 1). Indeed, in critically ill patients, hypoxic injury, disrupted epithelial permeability, altered gut motility, and treatment with vasopressors, parenteral nutrition, and opioids facilitate the expansion of pathobionts, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria [8]. Commonly, the gut microbiome of septic intensive care unit (ICU) patients demonstrates a loss of microbial richness and diversity, dominance of a single taxon (often a potential pathogen), and loss of site specificity with isolation of the same organism at multiple sites [9]. The duration of ICU dysbiosis, the clinical impact of dysbiosis, and phenotypes of critically ill patients more prone to develop it are all aspects that need to be clarified.",

Analysis of the gut microbiota in this model demonstrated that the Western diet alone led to loss of Bacteroidetes, increased Proteobacteria, and had evidence of antibiotic resistance development even before antibiotics were administered. In this elegant work, it was clearly shown how the selective pressures of diet, antibiotic exposure, and surgical injury can converge on the microbiome, resulting in lethal sepsis and organ damage without the introduction of an exogenous pathogen [11].",

Western diet mice also had an increased frequency of neutrophils, some with an \u201caged\u201d phenotype, in the blood during sepsis compared with standard fiber-rich mice.

            "text": "This preclinical observation has been confirmed by some limited clinical studies in which patients who developed sepsis showed an altered microbiota pattern at baseline. In a recent study, differences in the gut microbiota and plasma LPS level were evaluated in 32 patients who underwent splenectomy and 42 healthy individuals. The splenectomy group was divided into three subgroups according to the length of their postoperative time. Significant differences were observed in gut microbiota composition measured by 16s rRNA gene sequencing with regard to the relative bacterial abundances of 2 phyla, 7 families, and 15 genera. The LPS level was significantly higher in the splenectomy group than in healthy controls and was negatively associated with five bacterial families with low abundance in the splenectomy group. Interestingly, the degree of gut microbiota alteration increased with the length of the postoperative time [13]. Similarly, a seminal study showed that patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who developed antibiotic-induced dysbiosis had a five- to ninefold increased risk of bloodstream infection and sepsis [14]. These observations were confirmed by a retrospective cohort study including over 10,000 elderly patients in the United States and showing that dysbiosis was associated with a more than threefold increased incidence of a subsequent hospitalization for sepsis [15]. Expanding on these findings, Baggs et al. recently showed that exposure to longer durations of antibiotics, additional classes of antibiotics and broader-spectrum antibiotics during hospitalization were each associated with dose-dependent increases in the risk of subsequent sepsis. This association was not found for other causes of hospital readmissions, suggesting that the association between antibiotic exposure and subsequent sepsis is related to microbiome depletion, not to severity of illness [16].",

Beta diversity of the microbiome measured from feces of mice coming from two different laboratories demonstrated significant differences and, more importantly, mice from the first lab had significantly higher mortality following CLP, as compared to mice from the second lab (90% vs. 53%). Differences were also found in immune phenotypes in splenic or Peyer\u2019s patch lymphocytes. To verify if the differences in the microbiome were responsible for the different outcomes, mice were co-housed for 3 weeks, after which they assumed a similar microbiota composition. Interestingly, co-housed mice had similar survival regardless of their vendor of origin and differences in immune phenotype disappeared. This elegant experiment clearly shows that the microbiome plays a crucial role in survival from and in the host immune response to sepsis, representing a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

An important finding of this study was that the dominant factors associated with mortality and septic complications were the numbers of total obligate anaerobes [6]. To evaluate the effect of dynamics of the gut microbiome, a single-center study prospectively analyzed 12 ICU patients and showed that changes in the gut microbiota can be associated with patient prognosis [18]. Indeed, the proportions of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes significantly changed during the stay in the ICU, and \u201cextreme changes\u201d in the Bacteroides/Firmicutes ratio were observed in almost all the patients with a poor prognosis, suggesting a correlation between alteration in gut microbiota composition and sepsis outcome [18].",

            "text": "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) consists of administering fecal material from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of a patient with an altered gut microbiota to restore its functions. Clinician interest in this treatment was renewed in 2013 with publication of the results of a randomized controlled trial showing the substantial superiority of FMT over standard care in the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infections [35]. Based on the absolute number of introduced bacteria, FMT is thought to be the most powerful immunomodulatory tool. In animal models, FMT alone is capable of restoring bacterial communities in cecal crypts, which act as a reservoir of commensal bacteria to restore the intestinal epithelium. Crypts are also crucial in protecting intestinal stem cells and in preservation of immunological pathways by enhancing the expression of nod-like and Toll-like receptors. Depletion of commensal organisms in crypts enhances pathogen proliferation, which can result in severe inflammation and disruption of homeostasis. Another potential advantage of FMT is that, along with the transfer of bacterial communities, other products (short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, eukaryotic, and prokaryotic viruses) are introduced to the intestinal ecosystem, leading to a complete restoration of homeostasis [36].",

            "text": "The rationale for use of FMT in critical illness is fascinating and promising. However, its application in clinical practice among ICU patients is unexplored. We believe that FMT can have a potential role in critical patients in two directions: (1) restoration of ICU-associated dysbiosis and (2) implementation of gut decolonization of MDR organisms. In fact, the introduction of a high burden of commensal bacteria may reverse resistant pathobiont dominance and even decrease the antibiotic resistance genes present in the microbiome (resistome) [37]. However, only five cases have been described in which FMT has been employed to address disruption of the microbiota in the ICU. All these cases showed that treatment with FMT led to a successful reversal of dysbiosis, with subsequent improvement in outcome. In addition, some cases noted a steep decrease in inflammatory mediators and normalized Th1/Th2 and Th1/Th17 ratios following FMT. Apart from difficulties with extrapolating the data derived from these case reports to the general ICU population, we are far from obtaining conclusive evidence that restoration of dysbiosis by FMT in critical illness is beneficial. However, given the promising results of FMT learned from C. difficile treatment experience, clinical trials are needed to implement a microbiota-targeted approach.",

            "text": "Colonization with MDR bacteria is a leading cause of sepsis complications especially among vulnerable ICU patients [38]. The use of FMT for this purpose has been evaluated in different case series, retrospective and prospective studies, highlighting that this approach can be feasible safe and effective [39]. Results cannot be easily analyzed because of the high risk of bias in smaller studies, but in a recent review that considered only studies with low and moderate risk of bias, an eradication rate between 37.5% and 87.5% was described [40]. However, results of different studies cannot be conclusive because of different patient populations (with the most commonly organisms isolated pre-FMT being carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae [CRE], vancomycin-resistant Enterococci [VRE], and extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase [ESBL]-producing bacteria, and also Pseudomonas, methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA], and Acinetobacter, and differences in route of administration, choice of donors, and length of follow-up [39]. Recently, a randomized controlled trial has been completed showing that patients given nonabsorbable oral antibiotics followed by FMT had a slight decrease in ESBL and CRE colonization compared with control patients, although without reaching statistical significance. The unfavorable results are potentially due to the study design (two different routes of FMT in the interventional group and contemporary antibiotic administration may have influenced carriage in the interventional group) and early trial termination [41]. However, it is important to note that so far none of the published studies has been conducted in ICU patients. Until now, only one pilot study is ongoing among ICU patients with a prevision of enrollment of 10 mechanically ventilated patients with MDR colonization (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03350178).",
