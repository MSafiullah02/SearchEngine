The Institutional Review Board of Navitas Clinic approved the study (Approval Number: NC2020-01). Asymptomatic subjects have been recruited by web posting of our clinic, and written consent was obtained prior to the test.",

The positive rate of SRAS-CoV-2 IgG antibody was 5.9% (95% confidence interval[CI]: 3.1-10.1), consisting of six males (4.9% [1.8-10.3]) and six females (7.6% [2.8-15.8]). A healthcare worker who was only a participant with a positive result of the PCR test showed positive for IgG. The regional difference of the antibody-positive rate is 6.7% (95% CI: 3.4-11.6) and 2.7% (0.1-14.2) in Shinjuku of central Tokyo and Tachikawa of the suburban, respectively.",
