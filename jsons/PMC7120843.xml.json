            "text": "Evidence supporting the feasibility of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) follows from the observation that delivering very small tidal volumes at high frequencies can overcome the need for adequate bulk gas flow in the lung. While it had been appreciated years earlier that pressure oscillations could enhance oxygen diffusion [1], the stage was fully set for the dawning of the HFOV era in the early 1970s, after several investigators independently reported that applying small volume oscillatory vibrations to the airway efficiently eliminated CO2, even in the absence of chest wall excursion [2\u20135]. The discovery was made incidentally, during experiments designed to measure cardiac or lung impedance in large animals and humans. The investigators\u2019 fortuitous decision to monitor CO2 clearance provided the proof that ventilation with sub-dead space tidal volumes was possible. Thereafter, HFOV was recognized as a highly promising supportive care strategy, and very quickly it went on to play a major role in the global paradigm shift toward \u201copen lung\u201d ventilation techniques. By 1980, a series of 12 patients ranging in age from 3 days to 74 years had been successfully supported for an hour at a time, using a prototype piston pump oscillator capable of delivering tidal volumes as low as 7.5 mL, at 15 Hz [6]. In early 1983, the first pilot trial of HFOV for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) began enrolling infants [7].",

Concurrently, evidence implicating phasic alveolar stretch in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic lung injury in patients with respiratory failure has driven the iterative refinement of HFOV protocols. As of now, a large body of evidence suggests that repetitive cycles of pulmonary recruitment and de-recruitment are associated with identifiable markers of lung injury, and experimental models of ventilatory support which avoid alveolar overdistention, reverse atelectasis, and limit phasic changes in lung volume appear to be less injurious [8\u201315]. Chief among the major clinical trials that support this concept is the ARDS Network (ARDSNet) trial published in 2000. The ARDSNet investigators demonstrated that adults with acute lung injury or the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were randomized to receive a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg (predicted body weight) with plateau pressure limitation to \u226430 cm H2O had a mortality reduction of 22 % relative to those ventilated with 12 mL/kg tidal volumes and allowable plateau pressures up to 50 cm H2O [16]. This study is also one of several that would demonstrate a greater reduction in plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines among patients who are ventilated with lower tidal volumes [10, 17, 18]. Together these studies suggest that reducing the magnitude of phasic stretch during mechanical ventilation attenuates the systemic inflammatory response and can potentially reduce the incidence of nonpulmonary organ dysfunction in patients with respiratory failure.",

HFOV remains the most widely used form of high frequency ventilation in clinical practice today. In HFOV, lung recruitment and oxygenation are maintained by the application of relatively high mean airway pressure (Paw), while ventilation is achieved by superimposed sinusoidal pressure oscillations (\u2206P) that are delivered by an electromagnetically driven piston-diaphragm at a frequency of 3\u201315 Hz [11, 19]. HFOV is the only form of high frequency ventilation in which expiration is an \u201cactive\u201d process. This means that CO2 egress is facilitated by pressure gradients produced with each retrograde movement of the ventilator\u2019s piston, rather than requiring lung recoil or involvement of skeletal musculature. As a result, alveolar ventilation can be achieved during HFOV using tidal volumes in the range of 1\u20133 mL/kg, even in the most poorly compliant lungs [19].",

            "text": "Many years of detailed study in the laboratory have produced an accounting of the gas transport mechanisms at work during HFOV. While direct bulk flow can be enough to ventilate proximal alveolar units during HFOV, the key advantage of high frequency techniques in facilitating gas transport throughout the lung has to do with its ability to markedly accelerate the movement of gas molecules [20]. The added velocity alters the dynamics of gas distribution in ways that facilitate gas exchange. First, during HFOV efficient gas mixing is believed to occur through radial diffusion taking place along the parabolic inspiratory gas front as it advances down the airways [20\u201322]. Second, shear flows created by the advancing gas front spread concentration gradients over a broad axial area, a phenomenon called \u201cTaylor dispersion\u201d, which further facilitates diffusion. Third, \u201cPendelluft\u201d, or mixing of gases among alveolar units with varying time constants, also contributes significantly to gas exchange at high frequencies [20\u201323]. Finally, axial asymmetry of inspiratory and expiratory gas flow profiles creates separation of fresh gas and exhaled gas so that inspiratory gas flow travels down the central axis of the airway, while expiratory flow is distributed along the airway wall [20\u201322].",

Experiments performed in healthy rabbits have shown that CO2 elimination during HFOV is a function of frequency and the square of the tidal volume (V\nCO2 = f \u00d7 Vt\n2) [24]. In HFOV, tidal volume varies directly with the amplitude of oscillation (\u0394P), and varies inversely with the frequency (Hz) [25]. Reducing the frequency effectively lengthens the overall cycle time, which enhances CO2 elimination at the expense of a longer inspiratory time and a higher stroke (tidal) volume. Although much of the foundational research on HFOV involved the use of higher frequency ranges, satisfactory CO2 elimination can probably occur at many potential combinations of f and Vt, with higher frequency ranges providing conditions of lowest lung impedance and consequently, a lower pressure cost of ventilation [26, 27].",

While this relationship also holds true for conventional ventilation, an important distinction between the two modalities is that HFOV delivers the Paw as a continuous distending pressure, which maximizes the alveolar surface area available for gas exchange throughout the respiratory cycle. In the injured lung, HFOV produces better oxygenation and higher mean lung volume than conventional ventilation at an equivalent Paw, provided that the Paw is set above the lung\u2019s opening pressure (Fig. 10.1) [29]. If HFOV is initiated early enough in the disease process that pressure-volume hysteresis is preserved, a preceding recruitment maneuver can position the lung on the deflation limb of the volume-pressure curve, where lung volume (and oxygenation) is maintained at a lower Paw. Carefully adjusting the Paw setting downward, letting it hover just above the lung\u2019s closing pressure, will exploit pulmonary hysteresis, allowing satisfactory oxygenation at the lowest possible pressure cost (Fig. 10.2). In practice, this corresponds to the lowest Paw value that maintains the oxygenation gains from the recruitment maneuver. HFOV\u2019s superior ability to capitalize on pressure-volume hysteresis is a key part of the rationale for its use in the management of diffuse alveolar disease and airleak syndromes.\n\n\n",

Most of the clinical experience with HFOV involves the SensorMedics 3100A (CareFusion Corporation, Yorba Linda CA), which was approved for use in neonates in 1991 and for older infants and children in 1995. More recently, the SensorMedics 3100B high-frequency oscillatory ventilator (CareFusion, Yorba Linda, CA) became available for use in larger pediatric patients (>35 kg) and adult patients. The 3100B model was approved for use outside of the US in 1998 and within the US in 2001, addressing concerns arising from large animal experiments that adequate alveolar ventilation for larger patients might not be achievable using the 3100A model [32, 33]. The 3100B differs from the 3100A model by having a more powerful electromagnet, which produces faster acceleration to maximal oscillatory pressure (\u0394P). It also allows a higher maximal bias flow, which makes it possible to deliver higher mean airway pressures [34]. Many pediatric intensive care units now use the 3100A and 3100B oscillators interchangeably for older children, although operating each machine using a particular combination of settings may not produce exactly the same results in an individual patient. The automated piston centering mechanism on the current generation of 3100B oscillators was designed to counteract retrograde piston displacement when maintenance Paw is set in the range of 40\u201345 cm H2O [31]. At least one group of investigators has observed that operating the 3100B using an I:E of 1:2 and a lower Paw (30 cm H2O) can cause the piston position to shift in a way that truncates the pressure waveform, reducing tidal volume delivery below what the 3100A model would deliver at the same settings [31]. Clinicians can compensate for this phenomenon by adjusting settings as appropriate to achieve therapeutic objectives.",

Multiple lines of evidence using a variety of experimental models confirm that the endotracheal tube both distorts and dramatically attenuates oscillatory pressure waves (Fig. 10.3) and that the I:E ratio is an important determinant of how much pressure (and tidal volume) is ultimately transmitted to the alveoli [28, 31, 35\u201339]. Preclinical data have consistently shown that limitation of expiratory time using an I:E ratio of 1:1 promotes alveolar gas trapping. In fact, under certain conditions mean alveolar pressure can actually exceed the Paw displayed on the ventilator console [28, 30, 40\u201342]. This observation prompted the suggestion that HFOV be applied in the clinical setting using an I:E ratio no greater than 1:2.\n\n",

            "text": "Many neonatal intensive care units now use HFOV preferentially over conventional ventilation to support the most vulnerable preterm infants with moderate to severe lung disease [43]. In older infants and children, typical indications for initiating HFOV include (1) diffuse alveolar disease without evidence of severe airflow obstruction or intracranial hypertension; and (2) oxygenation failure (FiO2 \u22650.7 and mean airway pressure \u226515 cm H2O on conventional ventilation); or (3) ventilation failure (pH <7.25 with tidal volume \u22656 mL/kg predicted body weight and plateau pressure \u226530\u201335 cm H2O) [44]. When transitioning the patient from conventional (phasic) ventilation to HFOV, the Paw on HFOV is typically set up to 5 cm H2O above the Paw last used on the conventional ventilator, in order to maintain recruitment in the face of pressure attenuation by the endotracheal tube. Amplitude (\u0394P) is set by adjusting the Power control, which controls the amount of current that is delivered to the motor driving the ventilator piston. The frequency is initially set between 10 and 15 Hz for small infants. However, when initiating HFOV in children and adults, a lower frequency setting is usually necessary in order to achieve adequate ventilation. Strict age-based ranges have historically determined where clinicians set the frequency, partly out of concern that the present generation of high frequency ventilators would not be capable of generating enough volume displacement to adequately ventilate larger patients unless the frequency was drastically reduced. However, recent studies in test lung models [30], large animal models [38], and adult humans [30] have confirmed that frequency reductions have a greater impact on tidal volume delivery than amplitude increases, and tidal volumes approaching those generated during conventional ventilation can be delivered when \u201clow frequency HFOV\u201d is used (Fig. 10.4). Small animal models of lung injury appear to confirm that low frequency ventilation (5 Hz) produces histologic evidence of more severe ventilator-associated injury than high frequency ventilation (15 Hz), although studies differ on the magnitude of this difference [45, 46]. In accordance with these data, contemporary HFOV management protocols suggest maintaining the frequency at the highest level that will provide adequate ventilation [30, 43, 44, 47, 48] (Fig. 10.5). For patients with lower airways disease or for small infants who achieve adequate recruitment on low mean airway pressures, some experts advocate modest reductions in maintenance frequency in order to counter the tendency for lower airways collapse and air trapping in these situations [42].\n\n\n",

The next step in confirming that the patient has achieved a satisfactory degree of alveolar recruitment is to titrate the FiO2 downward, with the goal of arriving at a Paw that will allow arterial saturations to stabilize at \u226588\u201390 % (PaO2 55\u201380 Torr) using an FiO2 of \u22640.6, without evidence of hyperinflation or decreased cardiac output. Patients with any degree of intravascular volume depletion will often require volume expansion during the recruitment phase of HFOV initiation because under these conditions, alveolar pressure can quickly exceed the perfusing pressure of the adjacent pulmonary vasculature, creating an increase in alveolar dead space and hemodynamic deterioration [49, 50]. The final step in verifying the adequacy of lung recruitment following HFOV initiation, and an important mechanism for monitoring it thereafter, is to ensure that both hemidiaphragms are displaced to the level of the 8th or 9th posterior rib on chest x-ray [19]. When the patient demonstrates an ability to maintain target saturations on FiO2 of 0.5\u20130.6 for a period of time, he or she will generally begin to tolerate slow downward titrations of Paw in increments of 1\u20132 cm H2O, provided saturations remain stable. Once compliance begins to improve, surface forces will normalize, rendering the lung less prone to closure, and thus allowing lung volume to be maintained as Paw is decreased [51]. Until this occurs, suctioning should be minimized and unnecessary circuit disconnections should be avoided.",

In the latter case, any decrement in Paw should be corrected by further restricting the circuit pressure control valve (turning the \u201cmean pressure adjust\u201d knob clockwise) or by increasing the bias flow of fresh gas as necessary to maintain a stable level of distending pressure [34, 53]. In the event that very high pressure amplitudes are required to provide adequate ventilation, typical maintenance bias flow settings may be inadequate to ensure CO2 clearance from the circuit. In this setting, the bias flow should be augmented to counter potential increases in the circuit\u2019s effective dead space [30, 39].",

Ideally, Paw and \u0394P are then slowly lowered to a point just below the \u201cleak pressure\u201d, the value at which air is no longer seen draining from the thoracostomy tube, if there is one in place. From this point, hypoxia should be addressed by preferentially increasing FiO2 to 0.8 before increasing the Paw. In patients with airleak, routine recruitment maneuvers should be avoided following initiation of HFOV, if possible. Ventilation should be provided using the highest frequency that will allow adequate CO2 clearance, a technique which will minimize both inspiratory time and tidal volume [44]. Maintenance of a controlled modest respiratory acidosis with pH \u2265 7.25, is preferred unless clear clinical contraindications preclude this approach [23, 54\u201356]. Once chest radiographs indicate that the airleak has sealed for 24\u201348 h, many patients will tolerate a transition to a typical HFOV strategy for diffuse alveolar disease, as outlined above.",

            "text": "High chest wall compliance, surfactant deficiency, and unstable end expiratory lung volume all interact to potentiate repetitive cycles of derecruitment and reinflation that make the preterm neonatal lung particularly well-suited to an open lung strategy of ventilation. Over 20 years ago, a preclinical study exposing surfactant-deficient premature baboons to either HFOV or conventional ventilation demonstrated that early use of HFOV appeared to protect the animals from developing mechanical, biochemical, and histologic evidence of hyaline membrane disease [57]. A follow up study published in 2000 exposed surfactant-deficient premature baboons to exogenous surfactant plus either early HFOV or \u201clung sparing\u201d conventional ventilation with tidal volumes reduced to 4\u20136 mL/kg [58]. HFOV was initiated using a Paw 2 cm H2O above what was required to stabilize the animal on the conventional ventilator. Target blood gas tensions in each group were identical (PaCO2 45\u201355 Torr; PaO2 55\u201380 Torr), and high supplemental oxygen fractions were avoided through preferential increases in mean airway pressure or PEEP. Remarkably, the animals received supportive care for 1\u20132 months, allowing the investigators to sequentially examine an array of mechanical, cellular, and biochemical parameters as they sought to determine whether HFOV could mitigate the development of chronic lung disease over time. Animals supported with HFOV demonstrated significantly better pulmonary mechanics for nearly every one of the 8 time points at which they were evaluated between 12 h and 28 days (p < 0.05). Although between-groups differences for tracheal cytokine concentrations were less consistent across the study period, conventionally ventilated animals demonstrated significantly higher macrophage/monocyte, eosinophil, and lymphocyte infiltration by 10 days (p < 0.05). Finally, while both groups of animals demonstrated histopathologic findings consistent with chronic lung disease on post mortem examination, HFOV supported animals showed significantly better lung inflation patterns by panel of standards analysis (p < 0.001). Together these studies are representative of a remarkable two decades of scientific inquiry, which established that ventilator-associated injury amplifies the inflammatory response to the primary parenchymal insult experienced by patients with respiratory failure. Thus, the magnitude of acute lung injury, and the incidence and extent of chronic lung injury, are modifiable through the use of more protective ventilation strategies.",

The first large randomized, controlled trial in premature infants comparing high-frequency ventilation using a piston oscillator with conventional mechanical ventilation was published during the pre-surfactant era by the HIFI Study Group [62]. This crossover trial was designed to evaluate the impact of HFOV on the incidence of chronic lung disease of prematurity and included 673 infants weighing 750\u20132,000 g who had been supported less than 12 h on conventional ventilation for respiratory failure in the first 24 h of life. Infants randomized to receive HFOV were administered a Paw and FiO2 equal to those administered on conventional ventilation. Infants assigned to the HFOV arm who had not already been tracheally intubated at the time of randomization were supported using an FiO2 equal to what they received before intubation, and a Paw of 8\u201310 cm H2O. In each arm of the trial, hypoxemia was first addressed by increasing the FiO2, and then by increasing the Paw [62]. Significantly more infants in the HFOV group crossed over to the conventional arm of the trial after they were judged to have failed therapy with the assigned ventilator (26 % vs 17 %; p = 0.01). All infants were analyzed as part of the study group to which they were assigned. Ultimately the study was unable to show a significant difference in the incidence of chronic lung disease or in 28-day mortality between the two groups. Despite the fact that the HIFI investigators made efforts to limit maintenance mean airway pressures and indeed did not incorporate alveolar recruitment into the HFOV strategy, infants in the HFOV arm experienced a significantly higher incidence of airleak (3 % vs 1 %; p = 0.05). They also experienced a significantly higher incidence of periventricular leukomalacia and high-grade intraventricular hemorrhage, unanticipated developments that contributed to the trial\u2019s early closure [3, 62].",

            "text": "A decade later, two large multicenter trials were published in an effort to clarify the role of high-frequency ventilation in the management of the infant respiratory distress syndrome [63, 64]. By this time, many centers had accumulated a great deal of experience using the 3100A high frequency oscillator in neonates. Each of these trials emphasized alveolar recruitment as part of the HFOV strategy. In their remarkably well-controlled study, Courtney and colleagues randomized 500 preterm infants to receive either conventional ventilation targeting a tidal volume of 5\u20136 mL per kg body weight, or HFOV using a frequency of 10\u201315 Hz [63]. Eligible infants were less than 4 h of age, had received one dose of surfactant, and required mechanical ventilation using a mean airway pressure >6 and an FiO2 \u22650.25. These investigators were able to show that infants randomized to receive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation successfully separated from mechanical ventilation earlier than those assigned to a lung-sparing strategy of conventional ventilation. Those assigned to high-frequency ventilation also demonstrated a significant reduction in the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age [63]. By defining a disease threshold in the study infants, adhering to lung-protective protocols for mechanical ventilation, and extubating from the assigned ventilator according to specific criteria, this study identified a set of circumstances in which HFOV may be used with clear benefit in preterm infants with RDS [63]. In contrast, the companion trial by Johnson and colleagues included healthier patients, used fewer defined protocols, and pursued more aggressive ventilator strategies. In both study arms, Johnson and colleagues targeted a PaCO2 of 34\u201353 Torr, while Courtney and colleagues allowed more permissive levels of hypercapnea [63]. For those infants who were supported on HFOV, Johnson and colleagues initiated therapy at a frequency of 10 Hz, and if maximizing amplitude (\u2206P) did not achieve adequate CO2 clearance, the frequency was subsequently reduced [64]. Finally, Johnson\u2019s group transitioned the majority of study infants to conventional ventilation for weaning after a median time on HFOV of 3 days, a relatively small proportion of the total time on mechanical ventilation [64]. This trial found no difference between groups in its composite primary outcome, death or chronic lung disease at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.",

However, the difference in outcomes between the two trials is intriguing. It is possible that the rigorously controlled conditions in the Courtney study isolate the effect of HFOV with greater clarity. Their data suggest that only 11 infants need be supported with HFOV in order to prevent one occurrence of chronic lung disease at 36 weeks postmenstrual age [63]. Johnson\u2019s data suggest the number of infants needed to support on HFOV in order to prevent one occurrence of chronic lung disease is 50 [64]. Although the study design used by Johnson and colleagues may better represent actual practice, the outcomes indicate that exposure to aggressive conventional ventilation practices may ultimately counter the benefits of HFOV.",

Over 15 years ago, consistent identification of ventilator-induced lung injury on histopathology specimens recovered from CDH patients [66, 67] began to focus attention on the possibility that aggressive ventilator strategies seeking to manipulate pulmonary vascular resistance through hyperventilation actually produce excess morbidity and mortality in this population. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and Children\u2019s Hospital Boston published tandem articles in 1997 in which they reviewed their CDH outcomes over a 14 year time span (1981\u20131994) [66, 67]. In each paper, outcomes were stratified by time periods in which the prevailing management strategy was different than the one that the institution had used before. While overall survival for CDH was similar at each institution, both saw improved survival rates after instituting a strategy of permissive hypercapnea. In Boston, this difference achieved statistical significance (69 % survival vs 44 %; p = 0.007) [68]. In Toronto, where clinicians tended to use HFOV more commonly for CDH than their Boston colleagues, the use of HFOV was not independently associated with improved survival [66]. By now a variety of centers have published case series in which infants with CDH demonstrate dramatic short term reductions in PaCO2 and improvements in oxygenation when managed with HFOV [69, 70]. Some of these reports appear to confirm the Toronto experience that the use of HFOV may in fact be associated with an improvement in survival in this population [69\u201371].",

For those clinicians who opt to use HFOV for this population, it is essential to recognize that infants with CDH do not have inherently recruitable lungs. In this setting, attempts to improve gas exchange by applying high levels of mean airway pressure can actually increase the dead space fraction and may result in acute inflammatory injury, alveolar or airway rupture, or potentially dangerous elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance. For this reason, experienced centers often recommend limiting the mean airway pressure to 16 cm H2O or less [72]. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has developed an HFOV protocol that emphasizes maintaining preductal SaO2 above 85 %, tolerating hypercarbia provided the pH is compensated, and initiation of HFOV when the peak inspiratory pressure on conventional (phasic) ventilation exceeds 25 cm H2O. This institution has reported significantly increased survival among CDH infants since implementing this set of guidelines in 1995 [72].",

In one large multicenter trial, therapy with HFOV was coupled with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in an effort to identify the relative contribution of each therapy to outcomes in patients with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The investigators randomized 200 neonates with severe hypoxic respiratory failure and PPHN to receive therapy with either HFOV alone or conventional ventilation combined with iNO [73]. Crossover as a result of treatment failure resulted in combined therapy with HFOV and iNO. The study found that patients demonstrated significant short-term improvements in PaO2 during combined treatment with HFOV and iNO, after failing either therapy when it was delivered alone [73]. Combining HFOV and iNO was particularly effective among patients with severe parenchymal disease attributable to RDS and meconium aspiration [73]. The suggestion that iNO efficacy depends upon the adequacy of alveolar recruitment is also supported by a retrospective analysis of data from older children who were enrolled in a multicenter randomized trial of the use of iNO in the treatment of acute hypoxic respiratory failure[74].",

In general, each concluded that HFOV may be applied safely as rescue therapy in pediatric patients with severe hypoxic lung injury, and that its use is associated with improvement in physiologic endpoints such as PaCO2 and oxygenation index (OI = [(Paw \u00d7 FiO2)/PaO2)] \u00d7 100). In addition, there were no reports of worsening air leak [55, 78]. Each of these studies initiated HFOV after recruiting the lung, but one of them [55] modified the HFOV protocol for patients with active air leak by dropping the Paw below the leak pressure following recruitment, raising the FiO2 as necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation, and tolerating hypercarbia as long as the arterial pH remained above 7.25.",

The investigators randomized 70 patients to receive conventional ventilation using a strategy to limit peak inspiratory pressure, or HFOV at a frequency of 5\u201310 Hz, using an open-lung strategy in which the lung volume at which optimal oxygenation occurred was defined (SaO2 \u226590 % and FiO2 <0.6), and in patients with air leak, airway pressure was then limited while preferentially increasing in FiO2 to achieve saturations of \u226585 % and pH \u22657.25 until it resolved [54]. The study found no difference in survival or duration of mechanical ventilatory support between the two groups. However, significantly fewer patients randomized to receive HFOV remained dependent on supplemental oxygen at 30 days, compared to those who were randomized to receive conventional ventilation, despite the use of significantly higher Paw in the HFOV group [54]. The OI, used often in the pediatric literature to quantify oxygenation failure, was shown in this study to discriminate between survivors and non-survivors after 24 h of therapy. In addition, the time at which changes in OI were noted to occur influenced the likelihood of survival: an OI \u226542 at 24 h predicted mortality with an odds ratio of 20.8, sensitivity of 62 %, and specificity of 93 % [54]. Post hoc analysis revealed that outcome benefits were not as great among patients that crossed over to the HFOV arm [54], supporting the suggestion by numerous studies that HFOV is most efficacious if employed early in the course of disease, using a strategy that emphasizes alveolar recruitment [13, 57, 78\u201380].",

Treatment strategies for both arms of the study included a volume recruitment strategy and were directed at achieving SaO2 \u226588 % on FiO2 \u226460 %. Patients in the conventional arm were managed in a pressure-limited mode, targeting a delivered tidal volume of 6\u201310 mL/kg actual body weight, without specific attention to plateau pressures. Patients in the HFOV arm were ventilated at frequencies of 3\u20135 Hz, and were transitioned back to conventional ventilation when FiO2 \u22640.5 and Paw \u226424 cm H2O with SaO2 \u226588 %. After the transition, conventional ventilation was reinstituted using a Paw equivalent to the last setting on HFOV [53]. With regard to short-term physiologic measures, these investigators also reported a significantly higher Paw and significant early increases in PaO2/FiO2 among patients on HFOV [53]. Post-study multivariate analysis also revealed that the trend in OI was the most significant post-treatment predictor of survival, regardless of treatment group. Survivors showed a significant improvement in OI over the first 72 h of the study period, while non-survivors did not [53]. Although the OI is not a measure traditionally reported in the adult literature, it has been reported by some investigators as predictive of mortality in adult ARDS [82]. This trial was not powered to evaluate differences in mortality between the two groups, but there was a clear trend toward increased 30-day mortality among the patients randomized to receive conventional ventilation versus those who received HFOV (52 % vs. 37 %) [53].",

            "text": "Since the publication of that first clinical trial, experience with adult HFOV has been documented in six subsequent randomized controlled trials comparing HFOV to conventional ventilation in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure [83\u201388]. The largest of these enrolled 61 patients [85]. All of these studies maintained HFOV at a frequency of 5 Hz or less, a practice now believed to generate tidal volumes approaching what would be delivered during conventional ventilation [44, 89]. In 2007, Fessler and colleagues issued a consensus document in 2007 recommending that HFOV protocols for adult ARDS combine high amplitudes with the highest oscillatory frequency that will produce a target pH of 7.25\u20137.35 (Fig. 10.5) [44]. The large-scale, multicenter Oscillation for ARDS Treated Early (\u201cOSCILLATE\u201d) trial was the first to prospectively test this approach [90]. This trial was designed to evaluate the impact of high-amplitude, maximal frequency HFOV against an \u201copen lung\u201d, low tidal volume conventional ventilation strategy on all-cause hospital mortality for adults with ARDS. The investigators randomized 548 adults \u226516 years of age with acute hypoxic respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 \u2264200 on standardized ventilator settings) and diffuse alveolar disease to receive either phasic ventilation targeting a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and plateau pressure \u226435 cm H2O -or HFOV using the Sensormedics 3100B (CareFusion Corporation, Yorba Linda CA), oscillating at the highest possible frequency that would allow maintenance of an arterial pH >7.25. Both ventilator protocols targeted a PaO2 55\u201380 Torr, guided by a standardized PEEP (or Paw)-FiO2 grid, and both included recruitment maneuvers. Transition from HFOV to phasic ventilation and weaning from mechanical ventilatory support were strictly protocolized. Ultimately the steering committee terminated the OSCILLATE trial well short of its goal of enrolling 1,200 patients, after three consecutive interim analyses suggested an increase in mortality with HFOV. In the final analysis, the HFOV group had an in-hospital mortality of 47 % compared to 35 % in the control group (RR for death with HFOV 1.33; 95 % CI 1.09\u20131.64, p = 0.005). This new and perhaps surprising development in the history of HFOV trials has several intriguing implications. As the OSCILLATE trial investigators suggest, it is possible that the theoretical benefits of maximal frequency (i.e., \u201clow stretch\u201d) HFOV may be countered by deleterious effects from the high mean airway pressures that are typically required when using such a strategy [90]. The OSCILLATE trial outcomes may also compel clinicians to consider the possibility that HFOV may be a technique better suited to patients with diffuse alveolar disease and increased chest wall compliance\u2014conditions that often coexist in infants and young children with acute lung injury and ARDS.",

Global measures of alveolar plateau pressure, tidal volume, and pulmonary mechanics that are available from breath to breath when using conventional ventilation are not provided on the high frequency ventilator console. The operator must often use intuition when adjusting ventilator settings, risking sudden and clinically significant de-recruitment or alveolar over-distension. In recent years, respiratory impedance plethysmography (RIP) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) have emerged as two promising means by which pulmonary mechanics and alveolar recruitment can be assessed non-invasively at the bedside of patients receiving HFOV.",

            "text": "Respiratory impedance plethysmography is a monitoring technique that is capable of quantifying global lung volume by relating it to measurable changes in the cross-sectional area of the chest wall and the abdominal compartment. In RIP, two elastic bands with Teflon-coated wires embedded in a zig-zag distribution along their circumference are applied to the patient. One is typically placed around the chest, 3 cm above the xyphoid process, and the other is typically placed around the abdomen. Each of these two bands produces an independent signal and the sum of the two signals is calibrated against a known volume of gas. Use of this technique in association with HFOV has been validated in animal models [91, 92]. In a large animal model of acute lung injury managed with HFOV, Brazelton and colleagues have demonstrated that RIP-derived lung volumes correlated well with those that were obtained using a supersyringe (r2 = 0.78), and that RIP is capable of tracking global changes in lung volume and creating a pressure-volume curve during HFOV[91]. In a newborn animal model, Weber and colleagues were able to demonstrate that RIP is capable of detecting relative changes in pulmonary compliance that were induced by saline lavage [92]. Experience with RIP in human subjects is limited to investigations of its application during conventional ventilation. One study in adult patients [93] and another in pediatric patients [94] have utilized RIP to quantify the relative degree of de-recruitment that is associated with closed, in-line techniques for endotracheal tube suctioning, as compared to open suctioning techniques. Each study was able to demonstrate a potential role for RIP in tracking global changes in lung volume at the bedside.",

Therefore, ideal settings on HFOV would be those that achieve ventilation above the lower inflection point on the regional pressure-volume curves for the majority of lung units, while avoiding over-distension in the most compliant alveoli.\n\n",

In EIT, a series of electrodes is applied circumferentially to the patient\u2019s chest. The electrodes sequentially emit a small amount of electrical current which is received and processed by the other electrodes in the array. Receiving electrodes determine a local change in impedance based on the voltage differential calculated between the transmitting electrode and the receiving electrode. Well-aerated areas, which conduct current poorly, are associated with high impedance, while fluid and solid phases (including atelectatic or consolidated lung) would be associated with lower impedance [97]. The impedance values that are generated are referenced to a baseline measurement, and represent relative rather than absolute changes in electrical properties [96]. This process creates a tomogram that depicts the distribution of tissue electrical properties in a cross-sectional image (Fig. 10.7), and the thickness of the slice of thorax that is represented in the image varies between approximately 15 and 20 cm, depending on the circumference of the chest [96, 98]. Of the presently available EIT systems, the Goe MF II (University of Goettingen, Germany; distributed by Viasys, USA) seems to have the most favorable signal to noise ratio, and it is also capable of dynamic measurements at low lung volumes [96, 99]. This system scans at a rate of 13\u201344 scans/s (Hz), generating up to 44 cross-sectional images per second [96].\n\n",

Investigations using conventional ventilation in large animal models of lung injury have validated EIT against supersyringe methods for the determination of regional pressure-volume (or pressure-impedance) curves [96, 100], and have demonstrated good correlation between EIT-derived regional changes in lung impedance and CT-derived regional variations in aeration [96, 101]. Using EIT to track regional lung mechanics in a large animal model of acute lung injury managed with HFOV, van Genderingen and colleagues were able to demonstrate that regional pressure-volume curves constructed using maneuvers on HFOV show less variation along the gravitational axis compared with pressure-volume curves that are obtained using a supersyringe method, suggesting that recruitment is more uniformly distributed between dependent and non-dependent areas during HFOV [102]. Published experience with EIT in human subjects with acute lung injury or ARDS has correlated regional impedance changes induced by slow inflation maneuvers using the DAS-01P EIT system (Sheffield, UK) with regional lung density measurements obtained by CT scanning [103]. A group of investigators at Children\u2019s Hospital Boston recently utilized EIT to detect regional changes in lung volume during a standardized suctioning maneuver in children with acute lung injury or ARDS who were supported on HFOV. These data demonstrate considerable regional heterogeneity in volume changes during a de-recruitment maneuver (Fig. 10.8) [104] . The same investigators went on to correlate regional impedance changes with regional overdistension during HFOV in an animal model of acute lung injury, a finding bringing EIT research a step closer to identifying a precise role for this technology in the management of patients on HFOV [105].\n\n",

Theoretically, this technology can create opportunities for therapeutic intervention by dynamically tracking the regional differences in alveolar recruitment that make portions of the lung highly susceptible to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). However, there are important limitations to the presently available technology. For instance, substantial bias may be introduced into the EIT image because of the tendency for electrical current to follow the path of lowest impedance, rather than the path of shortest distance between the transmitting and receiving electrodes [97]. This phenomenon may account in large part for the variation between EIT measures of regional lung impedance and CT measures of regional lung density [103]. In addition, because EIT measures impedance changes that are relative to baseline values, changes in baseline regional intrathoracic impedance resulting from sources other than alterations in gas volume and distribution could lead to errors in the interpretation of EIT-derived data. Despite these limitations, several investigators have reported that EIT reliably detects regional alterations in pulmonary blood flow [106] and extravascular lung water [107]. In summary, identifying a useful role for EIT as an adjunct to HFOV at the bedside will depend on additional technical modifications to make it suitable for reliably detecting very small regional tidal volumes at high frequency in the electrically hostile environment of the intensive care unit.",

In general, when clinical improvement occurs to the point that Paw may be reduced to \u226420 cm H2O, FiO2 is reduced to \u22640.4, and the patient tolerates endotracheal suctioning without significant desaturation, it is appropriate to undertake a more detailed evaluation of the patient\u2019s response to phasic ventilation provided by conventional means [23]. This may be done by hand ventilating (with the aid of an in-line pneumotachometer, if necessary) while noting the pressures, tidal volume, and inspiratory to expiratory time ratio necessary to sustain satisfactory oxygen saturation. It is common to find on transition to conventional ventilation that the patient will demonstrate satisfactory gas exchange on a mean airway pressure several cm H2O below the last Paw on HFOV.",

HFPV is a form of high frequency ventilation in which a single ventilator (Percussionaire Corporation, Sandpoint ID) coordinates the set parameters of both conventional ventilation and HFOV to deliver time-cycled, oscillatory, subphysiologic tidal volumes at approximately 3 Hz to at least 15 Hz. These are superimposed on time-cycled, pressure-limited tidal volumes (10\u201315/min) whose magnitude is determined by peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and PEEP (CPAP) [108]. Oscillations during HFPV are created by a pneumatic \u201cPhasitron\u00ae\u201d (piston) positioned near the airway opening, which acts as both an inspiratory and expiratory valve and generates progressive, accumulative high velocity percussive waves that conduct into the lung. The net effect is a multiphasic oscillatory pattern that hits its maximum pressure during inspiration and its minimum pressure during expiration, when the lung recoils to the set PEEP (CPAP) level (Fig. 10.9) [108, 109]. The overall architecture of the respiratory cycle during HFPV is perhaps responsible for the observation that many patients can tolerate it without the need for neuromuscular blockade [108, 110]. During HFPV, the operator controls PIP, PEEP (CPAP), inspiratory time, expiratory time, percussive rate, and \u201cconventional\u201d rate [108].\n\n",

            "text": "Proponents of HFPV contend that it enhances tidal convective CO2 clearance while augmenting oxygen diffusion through high velocity flow, in the manner common to all high frequency techniques [108, 109]. In addition, percussive waves are believed to promote the clearance of airway secretions and debris, a process that is further potentiated by periodic lung recoil [108, 111]. This is the rationale underlying the use of HFPV in patients with inhalational lung injury, although published studies examining the impact of HFPV on the incidence of pulmonary infection have shown conflicting results [112\u2013115]. A variety of reports ranging from small case series [116\u2013123] to case control studies [112, 113] and small-scale prospective randomized trials [114\u2013116, 124\u2013128], have documented improved CO2 clearance and oxygenation efficiency at lower PIPs, when comparing HFPV to \u201ctraditional\u201d, high tidal volume conventional ventilation in neonates, children, and adults. There is a single published trial examining the efficacy of HFPV relative to lung protective ventilation using a modified version of the ARDSnet protocol [16, 115]. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, diagnosed by contemporary consensus criteria, was examined as a secondary outcome measure in this trial. The investigators randomized 62 burned adult patients with acute respiratory failure to either HFPV or conventional ventilation using tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight and plateau pressure limitation to \u226430 cm H2O. Only a portion (37 %) of the study population had documented inhalational injury. In the HFPV cohort, the investigators reported significant reductions in PIP up to 5 days following randomization. However, this did not translate to an overall difference in the study\u2019s primary outcome measure, ventilator-free days in the first 28 days of the trial [115]. Significantly more patients in the conventional ventilation arm of this trial experienced new airleak or otherwise unexplained pneumatocele (13 % vs 0 %; p = 0.04). There was a trend toward reduced incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the HFPV arm, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance (32 % vs 52 % p = 0.12). There was no difference in plasma cytokine levels between study groups. Significantly more patients in the conventional ventilation arm required a rescue mode of ventilation for failure to meet predetermined ventilation and/or oxygenation goals (29 % vs 6 %; p = 0.02), a finding which closed the trial short of its goal of enrolling 170 patients. Thus, the available evidence suggests that HFPV is associated with short-term improvements in the efficiency of gas exchange among lung injured patients, but clinical trials have not yet confirmed a clear advantage of this modality over current best practices for either conventional ventilation or HFOV. In particular, the impact of the larger, low frequency tidal volumes on the inflammatory response and overall course of lung injured patients managed with HFPV has yet to be fully elucidated [110]. Additional study will be needed before more widespread use of this modality outside of a controlled investigational setting would be justified.",

The difficulty in proving significant clinical outcome benefit in pediatric and adult patients may be due in large part to the diverse potential etiologies of respiratory failure in these populations as well as a wide range of approaches to their medical management applied over a relatively long period of mechanical ventilatory support. It is also possible that low frequency HFOV as traditionally used in larger patients may not be as protective as the higher frequency strategies that have been used with success in small animal models and human infants.",
