As week dragged into week, the garb of goggles, gowns, gloves, caps, booties, and the hated N-95 masks progressively drained faculty and senior residents of the energy required to engage medical students and residents. As friends became sick and physicians found themselves quarantined from families, morale plummeted, stripping enthusiasm for clinical responsibilities, including bedside teaching. All of these factors contributed to a morale in which the teaching environment was suboptimal. Given the circumstances, it is difficult to imagine how anyone could maintain a productive teaching environment during a sustained epidemic of more than 4 months.",

However, this was likely site-dependent, because we suspect that hospitals closer to those with ED closures bore the brunt of redirected patients, whereas more distant centers experienced less impact.
