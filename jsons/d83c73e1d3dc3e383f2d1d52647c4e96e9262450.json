However, a growing number of patients have reported no such exposure to animal markets, suggesting a possible person-toperson spread. 2,3 COVID-19 was imported to Tianjin on January 21, 2020. Tianjin Municipal authorities took aggressive measures to improve detection, isolate COVID-19 patients, and trace contacts to minimize opportunities for further transmission in community and institutional settings. 4 We summarize some epidemiologic features of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Tianjin during 2020, and we attempt to explore prevention and control measures.",

Haihe Hospital of Tianjin is the only designated hospital for the hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 in Tianjin. Clinically, the disease is divided into 4 types of cases: mild, ordinary, severe, and critical. Mild cases are defined as the cases with mild clinical symptoms and no pneumonia manifested through imaging results. Ordinary cases have fever, respiratory symptoms, and others symptoms of viral pneumonia manifested through imaging results. Severe cases meet any 1 of the following: (1) respiratory distress: RR \u2265 30 times/min; (2) fingertip oxygen saturation \u2264 93% under resting state; and (3) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 )/fraction of inspiration O 2 (FiO 2 ), P/F \u2264 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). Critical cases meet any 1 of the following: (1) respiratory failure and an artificial airway required for invasive mechanical ventilation; (2) shock; and (3) combining failure of organs, which require intensive care unit monitoring and treatment.",

The COVID-19 outbreak struck not only the urban areas, but also the suburbs. All of the 14 districts and counties were affected by COVID-19. The number of people living permanently in Tianjin was used as the denominator to compute the incidence of COVID-19. The familial clustering was found to be the most important characteristic of COVID-19. Patients with familial clustering accounted for 74.81% of cases, and there was no difference in clustering between urban and suburban areas. Infection was not found to be related to contact with animals. It has been preliminarily concluded that the source of infection is human. 6, 7 The attack rate in urban areas was significantly higher than the attack rate in suburban areas. However, of the 135 COVID-19 patients, 87 cases were common, accounting for 64.44%. The condition was relatively serious, and the case-fatality rate was 2.22%. The youngest case was 9 years old and the oldest was 90. The mean age was 48.87. With regard to the gender distribution of COVID-19 cases, 72 were male and 63 were female. The distribution by age and gender in urban and suburban areas showed no significant difference. The distribution by gender in urban and suburban areas showed a significant difference. There was a public place cluster in an urban area, and a total of 9 infected subjects were males, accounting for 31.03% of the male patients in the urban area. The 24 cluster cases in the suburbs were all linked to a local department store, 20 of which were female, accounting for 43.48% of the male patients in the urban area. The result may attribute to more male in the urban areas and more women suffering from the disease in suburban areas. These results indicate that the population is generally susceptible.",
