Due to the high viral contagiousness and transmission during the pre-symptomatic phase [3,4], COVID-19 progressively spread throughout China and has since become a global health issue [5]. In China, Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province, became the center of a COVID-19 outbreak [6]. In an effort to prevent a COVID-19 epidemic, Wuhan and its surrounding cities in Hubei province were locked down on January 23rd. However, a tremendous number of patients who were still in their incubation period traveled across China before the lockdown date due to Chinese New Year, resulting in the widespread transmission of COVID-19. Hunan province is adjacent to Hubei province. By March 20th, 2020, a total of 1018 confirmed cases had been reported in Hunan, most of which showed familial clustering.",

She has a more than 16-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has been taking oral prednisone (7.5 mg/d) since her diagnosis. She had not taken hydroxychloroquine or other immunosuppressive drugs. On January 10th, 2020, she spent 1 h dancing and singing in a room and one of her partners was later diagnosed with COVID-19. In the following 10 days, she had no contact with any confirmed or suspected patients. She returned to her parents' home in Yiyang on January 20th and after that never went out. Because of the severity of COVID-19, Hunan province carried out a \u2018level one response to major public health emergencies\u2019 on January 23. Therefore, Case 1 was placed under home quarantine and observation for 14 days. During the isolation period, she felt good and had no fever, cough or shortness of breath. Therefore, she was released from quarantine on February 6th. Just a day later, however, Case 1 began to have a mild cough, nasal congestion, and runny nose, but no fever. She paid little attention to her symptoms and did not seek further medical help. These symptoms improved 7 days later. On February 28th, she was admitted to hospital for screening because of her father's (Case 2) diagnosis of COVID-19. Her routine blood examination was abnormal, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.98 \u2217 10^9/L, hemoglobin concentration of 106 g/L, and platelet count of 73 \u2217 10^9/L. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 33 mm/h, which was above normal. IL-6 was normal. The SARS-CoV2 nuclei acid test from nasopharyngeal swabs was negative, but her IgM and IgG antibodies were positive. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies were negative. Lung CT (Fig. 2A, B) showed multiple lesions in both lungs. These results supported the diagnosis of COVID-19. Hence, she was given antiviral treatment, including 0.2 g BID of Abidol orally and 5 million IU of interferon nebulization. Nasopharyngeal swab virus nucleic acid tests were performed again on February 29th and March 3rd, both of which were negative. On March 5th, her lung CT (Fig. 2C, D) worsened, and ground-glass opacity changes were found in the right upper lung. She was given extra piperacillin sodium tazobactam sodium (4.5 TID), and then glycyrrhizin (150 mg QD). Her CT showed improvements and she was discharged on March 9th.",

In the beginning, he did not get treatment. On February 25th, the symptoms aggravated with a fever (38.0 \u00b0C) and shortness of breath. Influenza A and B viruses were negative. His chest CT (Fig. 2E) was abnormal with bilateral ground-glass opacities. His symptoms did not improve even after treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g Q48h), ambroxol, ribavirin (500 mg Q12h), and oseltamivir (75 mg BID). The SARS-CoV2 nucleic acid test was positive by both nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum on February 27th. His hemoglobin (83 g/L) and lymphocytes (0.65 \u2217 10^9/L) were below normal, and his D-dimer (5.46 mg/mL), C-reactive protein (134 mg/L), ESR (126 mm/h), IL-6 (7.6 pg/mL) were above normal. His arterial blood gas showed a PO2 of 67 mmHg and a FiO2 of 33%. Therefore, he was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 and admitted to the intensive care unit with support treatments including high fluids, oxygen, interferon, lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin for anti-viral therapy, linezolid, meropenem and fluconazole for anti-inflammation, and albumin, gamma globulin, steroids (80 mg/d) and recovery plasma (200 mL\u2217 2) to improve his immune system. His virus nucleic acid tests were retested on March 2nd and March 4th, with both showing negative. On March 3rd, his IgM and IgG specific antibodies were positive. Repeat blood gas on March 5th showed a PO2 of 114 mmHg and a FiO2 of 33%. His lung CT (Fig. 2F) showed that his inflammation lesions were absorbed and ground-glass opacities were improved.",

Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients can be infective before the disease onset and maintain infective ability during the convalescent phase [3,4,14]. According to Cao's report [15], the shortest observed duration of viral shedding was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. However, to date, no article has reported what kind of patients have a longer viral shedding time. In the family we report here, the index patient, Case 1, was from Wuhan and had contact with COVID-19 patients before she returned to Yiyang city. The other 4 family members were from Yiyang and had never left Yiyang, nor did they have contact with any other COVID-19 patients. It is most likely that Case 1 was the infective source in this family. By further examining their epidemiological data, we find that the incubation period of COVID-19 and the shedding duration of SARS-CoV2 might be extremely long in this case. The index patient did not develop atypical symptoms (including a mild cough and a runny nose) until 28 days after she had returned from Wuhan. Remarkably, Case 1 was immunocompromised due to her long-term use of oral prednisone, which might explain why she did not develop typical symptoms at first and why she had a longer duration of viral shedding.",
