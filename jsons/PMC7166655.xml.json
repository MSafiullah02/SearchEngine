The goal was to characterize the different genetic groups of the circulating strains in the hospital and determine the putative common origin (clusters) to better understand nosocomial transmission dynamics. Viral specimens with a cycle value at threshold of <30 were processed and submitted to HA1 gene sequencing. Because of economic constraints, only one gene was determined using sequencing analysis. Primer sequences and PCR conditions were applied according to the standard operating procedures of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre at the National Institute for Medical Research (London, UK). Ribonucleic acid sequences for the HA1 gene were assembled using a desktop software application framework for the organization and analysis of biological data, with a focus on molecular sequences and related data types (MUSCLE program, Geneious, Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand).18 Overall, 986 nucleotides of the HA1 gene were extracted using a computer program that eliminates poorly aligned positions and divergent regions of an alignment of deoxyribonucleic acid or protein sequences (gBlocks, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany)19 and maximum\u2010likelihood trees were estimated using a software that estimates maximum likelihood phylogenies from alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences (PhyML, South of France Bioinformatics Platform, Montpellier, France).20 One thousand bootstrap replicates were performed using the general time\u2010reversible model for correcting nucleotide substitution rates. HA1 sequences of 21 influenza viruses detected in the Swiss community using the Swiss Influenza Surveillance network were introduced in the phylogenetic analysis. All trees were rooted on the influenza A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) strain.",

In particular, on the ground floor, most of the patients were bedridden for orthopedic problems or rehabilitation, without the ability to leave their rooms, whereas on the first floor, patients hospitalized in the ward for Alzheimer's disease and severe cognitive impairment were frequently unable to adhere to the implemented infection control procedures.

In addition, asymptomatic cases (patients and HCWs) may be important vectors of influenza transmission. However, a recent meta\u2010analysis failed to establish firm evidence that preventive strategies help contain the spread of influenza infection within institutions for elderly adults.24 This lack of evidence to support any single preventive measure against influenza transmission in hospitalized elderly adults is due to the paucity of high\u2010quality clinical trials and related methodological challenges, including molecular diagnostics and clustering effects.",

This lack of virological confirmation may have inflated the number of HCWs with suspected influenza. Third, not all symptomatic patients were immediately swabbed, especially if they were hospitalized at the start of the outbreak in rooms distant from the index cases. Furthermore, not all influenza virus genomes were sequenced, so the overall number of cases could have been underdetected, or there could have been misclassification of community\u2010 and healthcare\u2010acquired cases. Finally, it was not possible to verify the influenza vaccination status of most patients, so vaccine effectiveness could not be evaluated in this population.",
