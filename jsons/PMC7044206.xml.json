            "text": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) leads to impaired lower limb blood supply usually as a result of atherosclerosis and associated thrombosis1. In 2010 an estimated 200 million people worldwide were living with PAD, an increase of ~30% since 2000 which has been referred to as a PAD pandemic2,3. The burden of PAD is increasing worldwide and particularly within low and middle-income countries4. PAD is associated with significant morbidity including intense leg pain during walking (intermittent claudication, IC), impaired walking ability, poor health-related quality of life and risk of serious complications such as major leg amputation and death1. Medical management of PAD is mainly focused on reducing the risk of cardiovascular events (through statins, blood pressure-lowering and anti-platelet medication prescription), rather than treating leg symptoms2. The only drug therapy available for IC is cilostazol5. The benefit of this drug have been deemed too small in many countries for it to be publically funded. In high-income countries the most widely used treatments for advanced PAD are surgical approaches to restoring the arterial blood supply to the legs using temporary balloons, permanent stents or open surgical bypasses. Stents and other peripheral revascularisation procedures have a risk of serious complications (such as major amputation, renal failure and death) and poor long-term durability5\u20138. There is great interest in developing novel medical therapies for the leg symptoms of PAD. Recent efforts have focused on stimulating development of new blood vessels within the leg through angiogenesis or by encouraging the remodelling of existing small vessels into improved collateral channels (arteriogenesis). Promising results for novel treatments, such as viral vectors carrying angiogenesis promoting agents and stem cells, in pre-clinical models of PAD have not been consistently replicated in large clinical trials9\u201312.",

            "text": "In patients that have PAD, atherosclerosis-associated arterial narrowing develops gradually over many years allowing the legs to adjust to the gradual decrease in blood flow through compensatory mechanisms within the blood vessels and muscle fibres13. In contrast, the most commonly used animal model for initial testing of novel therapies for PAD is a model of acute blood supply interruption through ligation or excision of the femoral artery (referred to here as the 1-stage hind limb ischemia (HLI) model)14,15. Previous studies report that the ligation and excision of the femoral artery in the 1-stage model leads to increased fluid shear stress within the limb collateral arteries resulting in altered gene expression patterns through shear stress responsive elements which promote arterio- and angio-genesis16\u201318. Hind limb blood supply in this 1-stage model therefore usually naturally recovers over a period of approximately 4 weeks15. This model does not therefore simulate the clinical presentation of PAD. Patients typically present with a history of acute exacerbation of chronic symptoms of leg pain on walking and have ongoing ischemic symptoms. The 1-stage HLI model may therefore not be an ideal model to study therapeutic angiogenesis and arteriogenesis14,19. Another approach to inducing HLI is the placement of an ameroid constrictor around the femoral artery to induce gradual occlusion16,20,21. Previous studies suggest that this approach leads to mild ischemia20 and that blood flow recovery occurs within 2\u20133 weeks16,21. Furthermore, previous pre-clinical PAD research has mainly focused on assessing hind limb blood supply with limited assessment of ambulatory ability14,15. On the other hand, the assessment of novel treatments in PAD patients usually involves measures of walking ability using treadmill or corridor walking tests22,23. There is therefore a need for an increased focus on functional tests of the limb within clinically-relevant rodent models.",

Briefly, the assessment of limb perfusion was by acquiring flow images of the ischemic and contralateral limb. All of the mice were evaluated under the same experimental conditions and were scanned from the lower abdomen to the end of the toes. During imaging, ambient light and temperature (maintained at 37 \u00b0C core temperature) were carefully controlled to avoid background variations. Hair was removed by epilating cream on the day prior to LDPI measurements, mice were placed in dorsal decubitus and anaesthetised using isoflurane (2.0% induction dose and 1.8% maintenance dose plus oxygen; 1 L/min, VET Equip). The LDPI system was mounted on a movable track that was fixed 26 cm above the mice limbs while the animals were restrained on a warming table with a black surface. Image analysis software (Laser Doppler Perfusion Measure, V3.08, Moor Instruments) was used to calculate the limb mean flux units, which represents a quantitative analysis of tissue perfusion on a scale of 0 to 1000 perfusion units (PU). Identical regions of both ischemic and contralateral non-ischemic limbs were assessed for quantification of perfusion. LDPI images were analysed by two independent observers blinded to the experimental group and averaged. Limb perfusion was expressed as the ratio of the flux value of the ischemic (left) limb relative to the value of the contralateral non-ischemic (right) limb in the same mouse and presented as average perfusion units (PU). Previous reports of the 1-stage HLI model suggested that the HLI typically resolved over the course of 28 days, with hind limb blood supply reaching a plateau between 21 and 28 days after surgery28. The LDPI measurements were therefore performed at the following time points for 1-stage HLI model: day 0 prior to surgery, immediately after surgery, days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after surgery. For the 2-stage HLI model, the LDPI measurements were performed at the following time points: day 0 prior to the first operation (ameroid placement), immediately after the first operation, days 3, 7, and 14 after the first operation, immediately after the second operation (femoral artery excision), and 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after the second operation (i.e. 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days after the first operation). A schematic illustration of the experimental design is shown in Fig. 1A. Body mass was also measured on the same day as the LDPI measurements.",

The speed of the treadmill was controlled using the software and calibrated using an inbuilt speedometer mounted on the treadmill platform. A treadmill test involved an initial warm up at 5 m/min for 5 min followed by a progressive speed increase from 5 to 10 m/min, accelerated at 1 m/min. Following this the treadmill speed remained at 10 m/min for up to a total running time of 20 min. During the test a stimulus grid of 3 Hz was kept on until mouse exhaustion as previously reported31. Exhaustion of the mouse was defined if the mouse returned to the stimulus grid 10 times despite a 3 Hz electrical stimulus to encourage walking on the belt. The treadmill software recorded the total distance walked by a mouse until exhaustion. A blinded observer supervised the experiment to assess outcomes. The treadmill belt and lanes were cleaned with water and 70% alcohol and dried with paper towel after each test to remove any body scent. Treadmill testing was carried out before ameroid placement, 10 days after ameroid placement, and 1 and 3 weeks after completion of the 2-stage HLI (Fig. 1A).

Gastrocnemius muscles were also harvested from a subset of mice (n = 15) subjected to the 2-stage HLI (n = 5/time-point) prior to and days 3 and 7 after ameroid placement. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in OCT compound (ProSciTech) at \u221280 \u00b0C. Tissues were pulverised in RIPA buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 1.0% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Australia) and PhoSTOP (Roche Diagnostics, Australia) to extract proteins and quantitated using the Bradford protein assay kit (BioRad, USA). Samples (25 \u03bcg of protein/lane) were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. After electrophoresis (110 V, 90 min), the separated proteins were transferred (15 mA, 60 min) to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (BioRad, USA). Non-specific sites were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk for 60 min, and the blots were then incubated with following antibodies: anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF, 1:1000; Cells Signalling, USA), anti-VEGF-Receptor 1 (anti-VEGF-R1, 1:1000; Cell Signalling, USA), anti-VEGF-R2 (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), anti-phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (anti-p-eNOS, 1:1000; Cell Signalling, USA), anti-eNOS (1:1000; Cell Signalling, USA), anti-hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (anti-HIF-\u03b1, 1:1000; Cell Signalling, USA), anti-transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member-4 (anti-TRPV4, 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and anti-kruppel like factor-4 (anti-KLF4, 1:1000; R&D), overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Anti-rabbit HRP conjugated IgG (1:1000; DakoCytomation, Denmark) or anti-goat HRP conjugated IgG (1:1000; DakoCytomation, Denmark), were used to detect the binding of its corresponding antibody. The protein expression was estimated with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, USA) and quantified by Quantity One (version 4.6.7) software (BioRad, USA). Membranes were stripped and re-blotted with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (anti-GAPDH, 1:10,000; Abcam, UK) and used for densitometry quantification. The raw data were analysed by normalising the relevant protein\u2019s band intensity to the mean intensity of the housekeeping protein GAPDH. The final data were represented as arbitrary units (A.U.).",

In order to examine whether an established clinically effective therapy was effective in the novel animal model, the effect of exercise training (using a running wheel) on functional capacity of mice subjected to 2-stage HLI was assessed. Exercise training was commenced 5 days after ischemia induction. Exercise training did not affect limb perfusion as assessed by LDPI (Linear Mixed effect test, p = 0.700; Fig. 5B,C). Mice subjected to exercise training showed a significant increase in average treadmill walking capacity compared to sedentary controls (p = 0.003; Fig. 5D).",
