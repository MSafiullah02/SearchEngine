As many parts of the U.S. are flattening the curve to control the current outbreaks and maintain hospital capacities through a combination of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and expanded testing, the federal and many state governments are starting to coordinate efforts to ease restrictions and eventually end the lockdown. This project aims to explore the feasibility of gradually relaxing social-distancing orders when a vaccine is not yet available. Focusing on a large urban area (King County, WA), we simulated the outcomes of various opening-up scenarios for one year since the first infection started.

As expected, Scenario 1, the most powerful and long-lasting social distancing, was most effective in reducing total infections from 41% to 15% of the population, compared to Scenario 0. New incidence peaked on March 18 th in Scenario 0 with 37,304 newly infected persons whereas other scenarios peaked on March 11 th , with 18,881 persons. The ranking by effectiveness in reducing transmission is Scenario 1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 4, 7, 8, 0. See Figure 2 . However, Scenarios 1 to 8 all yielded a second wave. Even in Scenario 1, the best case, whose daily new infection dropped to 2 on June 4 th and remained around 20 per day until August, as soon as the social distancing strategies were relaxed and school opened, its incidence peaked again to 874 cases per day without import cases. It is noteworthy to look at the total infection since May 4 th for Scenarios 2 and 5. Although Scenario 2 totally reopened society from September 1 st , the total infection is similar to Scenario 5 which retained low social distancing from September until the end of the simulation. This implies that extending one more month of strong social distancing until June 4 th could be as effective as retaining low social distancing in September. See Figure 3 . .

In addition, we did not consider hospitalization and fatality as we focused on disease transmission. Considering 100% of severe patients self-isolate at home with only reduced contact in household, we assumed that the intervention performed similarly to hospitalization or death in terms of reducing disease transmission. .
