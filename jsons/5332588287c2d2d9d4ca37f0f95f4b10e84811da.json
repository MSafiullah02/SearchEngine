This 4 study surveyed 370 international orthopaedic surgeons affiliated with the American Association 5 of Hip and Knee Surgeons to help identify the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 6 patient care. A total of 99 surgeons (27% of those surveyed) completed the questionnaire 7 representing 32 different countries. Except for surgeons in Japan, all respondents noted that their 8 practice had been affected to some degree and 70% of the surgeons have cancelled elective 9 procedures. More than a third of the surgeons have had to close their practices altogether and the 10 remaining open practices were estimated to be sustainable for 7 weeks on average given their 11 current situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in marked changes to the majority of 12 international arthroplasty practices.",

Since that time, the disease has spread 16 worldwide to an extent not seen in decades and poses an important global health threat [1] . It is 17 now known that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus 18 which produces symptoms that are much more severe than the seasonal flu, with fatality rates 19 around 1.4% [2] . The virus is transmitted person-to-person and health-care professionals may 20 serve as a mechanism for hospital associated transmission and outbreaks [3] . Healthcare 21 providers are at risk of propagating this disease and this risk is not exclusive to those healthcare 22 workers at the 'front lines' of the pandemic (e.g. emergency department, isolation wards, etc.). In 23 one recent report, upwards of 78% of health-care workers infected were outside of these front 24 line areas, allowing infection to spread [4] . As such, measures to slow the spread of infection 25 have been witnessed worldwide in targeting all departments within hospitals. 26 The need to slow the rate of transmission and accountability of proper stewardship of 27 medical resources is of utmost importance. The acute spike in sick patients with COVID-19 in 28 Italy and Spain, for example, showed that hospitals could quickly become depleted of necessary 29 medical equipment to protect patients and staff. A similar situation has been seen in U.S. based 30 hospitals where we have seen key shortages in ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE), 31 and blood products [5] [6] [7] . In response, early recommendations were made by the American The responses were anonymous and tabulated and reported in aggregate form.",

Twenty-two respondents report that In general, survey results from the international hip and knee arthroplasty societies from 102 Japan, Germany, China, and Italy were similar to the results from AAHKS poll. There were 103 some notable differences between societies. Japan had the highest number of respondents still performing arthroplasty cases, while Italy had the lowest. As expected, telemedicine was adopted 105 by many societies, and most Italian surgeons are performing some form of telemedicine. We 106 were surprised to see that very few surgeons across societies practice safe intubation/extubation 107 guidelines and wear an N-95 respirator mask during operative procedures (Table 5) . COVID-19. Thus, they recommend routine wear of the respirator at all times to prevent infection and spread both in the OR and while rounding on the floor. In our study, it was found that 67 151 surgeons reported using an N-95 respirator to some capacity in the OR, with 32 wearing them in 152 the OR for every surgical procedure. However, over half of responders (58) reported not using an 153 N-95 mask during any inpatient rounding duties. Based on the data available from the Wuhan 154 study, it would seem reasonable to recommend using an N-95 respirator mask at all times; 155 limited access to N-95 respirators may have played a role in the reported numbers in our survey.",

Most surgeons used an N-95 respirator to some capacity while operating 90 (67), but to a lesser extent when rounding on the wards (41). 91 Surgeons were affected personally. There were 4 surgeons that tested positive for 92 COVID-19 infection. Almost half (42) of the surgeons reported they were no longer working at 93 all. Responders reported that the average number of weeks their practices could sustain the 94 current economic pressures was approximately 7 weeks. Forty-four respondents replied that they 95 have had to forego their salary and 22 have had to lay-off or furlough employees. A large 96 majority (82) of responders have not received any financial assistance from the government. 97 Many surgeons have turned to digital platforms to aid in their direct patient care with 72 98 relying on telephone or video based applications to communicate with patients. WhatsApp 99 (WhatsApp, Menlo Park, CA) seems to be a preferred method of patient communication for 100 responders.",

Global, regional, and local pressures have affected orthopaedic surgeons worldwide. This110 survey of international AAHKS members is an attempt to characterize the impacts of the 111 COVID-19 pandemic on arthroplasty practices worldwide. Most notably, the majority of 112 arthroplasty practices have been affected with all 99 surgeons responding that their practice has 113 been affected to some degree and 71 having cancelled elective procedures altogether. Semi-114 urgent procedures, such as those performed for periprosthetic fractures or infections, are still 115 being performed. More than a third of responders noted that they have had to close their 116 practices altogether and the remaining open practices were estimated to be sustainable for 117 another 7 weeks on average. 118 The financial impact of COVID-19 on arthroplasty practices worldwide is 119 unprecedented. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and AAHKS have requested 120 from the U.S. government a number of provisions to support arthroplasty surgeons during this 121 healthcare and economic crisis. These include flexibility with Health Insurance Portability and 122 Accountability Act (HIPAA) rulings for good faith actions to provide telehealth, a delay of the 123 2019 Merit-Based Incentive Payment System reporting deadline, Good Samaritan protections for 124 COVID-19 volunteers, Federal support for physician practices, suspension of any possible 125 proposed Medicare cuts, and an allowance to expand of physician owned hospitals to treat 126 Key shortages in ventilators, personal protective equipment, and blood products have 128 been observed throughout the U.S. [5-7]. As more local governments have issued 'shelter in 129 place' laws, blood donations have decreased only adding to the shortage. In an attempt to slow 130 the depletion of these vital resources, many hospitals have cancelled elective surgeries including 131 THA and TKA. Our results suggest that this trend is occurring internationally as well, with 71 132 practices having cancelled all elective procedures. Sixty-four international surgeons responded 133 that their hospital is experiencing supply disruptions, 41% experiencing staff related disruptions, 134 and 22% will be unable to take care of all infected COVID patients requiring hospitalization. 135 Anesthesia providers are at a particular risk, as every intubation and extubation poses an 136 aerosol-producing chance to spread the infection [10]. Interestingly, less than half of the 137 respondents claim that protocols have been implemented to decrease the risk of infection to 138 hospital staff after intubation and extubation. Close to half of the respondents endorsed efforts to 139 screen surgical patients for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in an attempt to improve overall safety for all 140 providers. Ultimately, limiting surgical procedures decreases the amount of necessary PPE and 141 as such there appears to be international pressure to decrease amount of elective procedures. 142 While only 4 respondents have tested positive for COVID-19, ten percent of surgeons are 143 currently performing non-orthopaedic medical care and may be at further risk of contracting the 144 virus. A survey of orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan, China was recently published examining the 145 effects of utilizing N-95 respirators on COVID transmission [11]. The authors determined that 146 the incidence of infection in orthopaedic surgeons was up to 20.7% in the early stages of the 147 outbreak with the main suspected site of infection occurring on the general wards (i.e. not 148 isolation wards). The use of N-95 respirators was found to have a protective effect against 149",

Additionally, five musculoskeletal procedures (hip 162 arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty, laminectomy, spinal fusion, and lower extremity fracture care) 163 account for 17% of those elective procedures. Without elective procedures continuing to provide 164 revenue, the financial burden on hospital organizations will only increase.
