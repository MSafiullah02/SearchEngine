Thus, widespread availability, high efficacy and low costs make antibiotics a cornerstone of modern medicine. However, after many decades of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics\nuse and misuse, multiple antibiotic-resistant pathogens are emerging. These pathogens include, but not limited to, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, extreme drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and plasmodium falciparum [17]. Antibiotic-resistant pathogens pose a threat to global health. Additionally, broad-spectrum antibiotics bring the risk of perturbing normal and beneficial microbiome in vivo [36]. The perturbations or dysbioses of normal or beneficial microbiome has been linked to a range of diseases including Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, diabetes, obesity and immune defects [10]. These threats on public health worldwide are detrimental.",

            "text": "Antibody-based therapy for infectious diseases is not new. As far as in the 1890s, serum immunoglobulin was used to neutralize bacterial virulence [7]. Later, serum therapy was applied to a wide range of other infectious diseases such as meningococcal meningitis, pneumococcal pneumonia, streptococcal scarlet fever, varicella, measles, the pandemic Spanish influenza [15] and Ebola\nvirus disease as well as cytomegalovirus [14, 31]. However, adverse reactions such as serum sickness and anaphylaxis harmed the efficacy of serum therapy [9]. With the discovery of antibiotics, serum therapy in infectious pathogens quickly declined. Antibiotics therapy soon became a mainstay of bacterial infections treatment. However, the success did not last long with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The failure to develop new antibiotics with different mechanisms of actions again trapped patients by the super drug-resistant bacteria. Besides, for individuals with compromised immunity, antimicrobial chemotherapy provides a less effective treatment [28]. Obviously, antibiotics are ineffective at eliminating viruses. The emergence of antibiotics resistance calls for renewed efforts. Among the many options, monoclonal antibody (mAb) may be an alternative, reminiscent of the successful application of antitoxin in fighting against meningococcal meningitis in pre-antibiotic era. Indeed, Nebacumab, the first human therapeutic mAb reviewed by a regulatory agency, was engineered for the treatment of sepsis and gram-negative bacteremia [61]. However, the CHESS (Centocor: HA-1A Efficacy in Septic Shock) trial conducted in the USA which found non-statistically significant increase in mortality between the monoclonal anti-endotoxin antibody Nebacumab and placebo groups in patients with gram-negative bacteremia lead to the withdrawal of Nebacumab [20].Currently, only two humanized antibodies Palivizumab and Raxibacumab are approved for infectious diseases. Many other engineering antibodies against infectious pathogens are under development [2, 5, 16, 45, 67]. In this chapter, we summarize existing technologies for antibody engineering and optimization.",

[13, 14]. It was later discovered that the mechanisms behind it were predominantly due to neutralizing activity and effector functions of immunoglobulins in serum. Antibodies derived from immune sera are polyclonal in nature. However, problems such as lot-to-lot variation and the immune response against animal-derived antibodies contributed to the reduced efficacy of serum therapy. Besides, the preparation of these serum products were expensive and labor-intensive. These complications together with the discovery of antibiotics limited the application of serum therapy in infectious pathogens after 1935. Nevertheless, this early attempt opened up the possibility of antibody-based therapies in infectious diseases.",

Clinical trials showed no overall benefit of HA-1A, but significant improvement in the survival rate in a subgroup of patients [76].

Yang et al. successfully generated high affinity human antibodies against human envelope glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 by saturation mutagenesis of CDRs [71]. The Fab fragments were displayed and selected for improved binding to the immobilized gp120 [71]. Among the CDR residues, residues in CDR3 are often concentrated for affinity optimization [52].

This dual binding capacity will increase targeting specificity or redirect specific immune cells to pathogens or infected cells, thus enhancing pathogen elimination. Recently, bispecific antibodies BiS4\u03b1Pa against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generated [39]. BiS4\u03b1Pa was designed to bind to PsI and PcrV. PsI is an extracellular polysaccharide which involves in immune evasion and biofilm formation. PcrV takes part in the secretion of virulence factors. Animal studies showed that binding to PsI and PcrV led to superior protective activity of BiS4\u03b1Pa [39]. Now BiS4\u03b1Pa is in clinical candidate for the treatment of P. aeruginosa [39]. Berg et al. constructed a bispecific antibody by linking one heavy/light chain pair from an antibody against CD3 on cytotoxic T cells to a heavy chain whose variable region was replaced by sequence from CD4 [6]. The constructed antibody has dual binding specificity with one arm binding to CD3 on cytotoxic T cells and the other arm which contained sequences from CD4 binding to viral envelope protein gp120 of HIV [6]. Thus, the bispecific antibody redirected cytotoxic T cells to HIV-infected cells whose surface express integral viral proteins to eliminate pathogens. Bispecific antibodies hold great promise in the elimination of HBV, bacteriophages and other pathogens [48, 60].",

It is a holy grail to produce human antibodies with high therapeutic efficacy. The therapeutic potential of antibodies is derived from less immunogenicity, proper serum circulating time, high antigen-binding affinity, exquisite specificity and robust effector function. Advancement in antibody engineering technologies makes it possible to produce antibodies tailored to different infection pathogens. Over the past decades, the \u201cmagic bullet\u201d has obtained fruitful success in a wide range of diseases including tumors, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions. However, in the field of infections, there is a gap between preclinical researches and clinical applications. Many engineered antibodies are still making their way through preclinical/clinical tests, only few are approved for market. Here, we provided a review of technologies for antibody engineering and optimization. We are optimistic about the application of engineered antibodies to treat infectious pathogens. With the emergence of new infectious pathogens and multidrug resistant bacterial, engineered antibodies may offer another choice to combat these threats.",
