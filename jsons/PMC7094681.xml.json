CypA is not amenable to more stringent and rapid regeneration conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, CsA is a hydrophobic molecule with limited solubility in aqueous solutions and has a tendency to adhere to tubing and tips at concentrations greater than 1.2 \u03bcM. Ethanol (2%) was used in experimental running buffers to help alleviate solubility problems. Ethanol was used in preference to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) because this binds weakly to CypA [31]. The 60-min total regeneration time between experiments helped to eliminate any carryover of CsA [32]. A concentration series of CsA ranging from 0.5 nM to 1.2 \u03bcM was typically run in these experiments.

We wanted to test whether the His-CypA sensor surfaces described in the above sections could be used to facilitate the primary screening of these small-molecule (M\nr \u223c300\u2013500 Da) ligand libraries. Fig. 5\nA graphically illustrates the equilibrium response signal attained for 120 \u03bcM of the respective ligands. These compounds were chosen as positive controls to assess the sensor surface because they have previously been shown to bind to CypA with K\nd values in the 10- to 100-\u03bcM range (Table 2\n). One problem encountered was that the ligands tested have limited solubility in aqueous buffers, and this led to significant variation in the response signals for repeat runs of the same ligand. In addition, large \u201cspikes\u201d in the RU signal at the beginning and end of the injection phases further hampered reliable direct detection (data not shown). These can likely be attributed to a bulk phase shift given that there are large amounts of insoluble material present during the mobile phase as it passes over the chip surface with protein attached. Ethanol (2%) was added to the running buffer to help ligand solubility for all runs. Higher concentrations of either ethanol or methanol resulted in protein denaturation and rapid loss of activity on the sensor surface on subsequent runs (data not shown). DMSO was avoided as a solvent because this binds to CypA itself, albeit very weakly [31]. Nevertheless, direct binding to His-CypA could be detected for the ligands KM19, KM184, KM198, and CD291/02 (Fig. 5A).",

            "text": "Covalent coupling of proteins via primary amines is frequently the method of choice for immobilization in SPR assays, generating sensor surfaces with high ligand density and no baseline drift. Our results here illustrate, however, that CypA is not amenable to direct covalent linkage using primary amines. Protein activity levels for CypA directly immobilized on CM5 surfaces were only approximately 5%. This activity was unaffected by the initial immobilization levels; immobilization of between 1000 and 5000 RU of untagged CypA gave essentially the same low levels of activity (Fig. 2B). The X-ray structure indicates that the majority of CypA\u2019s 16 primary amines (15 lysine residues and the N terminus) are surface exposed [33] and probably available for direct covalent linkage. However, the surface electrostatic potential of CypA (Fig. 6\n) illustrates that the front face (the CsA binding face) is strikingly basic, whereas the rear face is much more acidic in character. Under the solution conditions (pH 4.9) used during the immobilization process, the surface charge potential of CypA seems likely to force the molecule to orient itself with the CsA binding surface oriented downward toward the activated chip surface. Thus, most of the covalent linkage would occur via residues on the CsA binding surface, resulting in severe steric occlusion of the binding of CsA. The activity levels of CypD immobilized by direct covalent linkage, under similar conditions and with similar final protein immobilization levels, were approximately 45 to 65% [32]. However, CypD does not possess the same markedly polarized surface charge potential of CypA; thus, coupling via primary amines is unlikely to take place predominantly on the CsA binding face.",

Using the N-terminal histidine tag to first capture CypA on the NTA sensor surface seems to provide a measure of orientation for the immobilized protein. The 10-amino acid linker between the hexahistidine tag and the start of the CypA sequence likely lifts CypA away from the active chip surface, preventing coupling to random lysine residues that hinder/prevent CsA binding. The only primary amine near enough to the activated sensor surface is the N terminus, and the entropic effects of being immobilized near the surface via the histidine tag may provide specificity for coupling essentially only to this primary amine. Thus, the protein is covalently immobilized but is kept active and sterically competent for CsA binding.",

The hydrophobic cyclic undecapeptide CsA is in multistate equilibrium between two extreme conformations influenced by the solution conditions. In aqueous solution, CsA tends more to adopt a compact closed conformation [37], whereas cyclophilins bind tightly only to an open conformation. The slower than diffusion limit on-rate constants might reflect the CsA conformational equilibrium. The off-rate constant for the CypA:CsA interaction appears to be two- to threefold quicker than that between CsA and CypD (0.012 and 0.004 s\u22121, respectively [32]) (Table 1). This slight difference may reflect genuine differences in the molecular details of the interaction between CsA and these two differentially localized, functionally distinct cyclophilin isoforms. CypA is ubiquitously localized in mammalian cytoplasm [13], whereas CypD is a mitochondrial-targeted PPIase [38]. Nevertheless, the binding constants obtained in this study for the equilibrium dissociation constant for CsA binding to His-CypA by SPR agree well with the values for the same interaction determined by a variety of experimental approaches, including ITC, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and PPIase enzymatic assays (Table 1). This does suggest that the protein molecules immobilized on the chip surface behave in a manner comparable to that of protein molecules in solution, at least in terms of binding to CsA.",

Structural data of these cyclophilin\u2013ligand complexes are not available, and the bound conformation of the ligands is not known. Poor solubility, aggregation, and/or nonspecific binding of the ligands may also play a role in the calculation of their apparently slow on rate, and it is possible that the functional ligand concentration, competent to interact with the immobilized His-CypA, is less than the expected measured total. This would result in the apparent on rates being faster and the equilibrium dissociation constants being tighter. However, this is unlikely to cause orders of magnitude changes in these kinetic constants. It is reassuring to note that despite the slow calculated on rates, the apparent K\nd values for these ligands and the rank order of their relative affinities determined from the competition experiments agree with the values determined by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence experiments.",

In early work analyzing the interaction of CypA and CsA and the conformational requirements required for this interaction [39], [40], [41], CsA (conjugated to bovine serum albumin [BSA]) and not CypA, was immobilized on the sensor surface [39]. Although interactions between CypA, directly coupled to the sensor surface, and protein binding partners have been published (e.g., HIV-1 capsid [28], HIV-1 Vpr [42], SARS coronavirus [30]), the activity and sensitivity of a sensor surface needed to detect binding in these much larger molecules are significantly less than those required to detect small molecules.",

Furthermore, it provides a good methodology that would allow the development of a medium-throughput screen for small molecules ligands/inhibitors of CypA that may provide useful leads in developing new drugs for the treatment of diseases such as HIV and malaria.",

Panels A and B show the reference-corrected sensorgrams corresponding to the injection (phases a1\u2013a2) of 850 nM His-CypA over a Ni2+\u2013NTA sensor surface. (A) After saturation of the signal response (\u223c3100 RU in this experiment), the injection of protein was stopped and the sensor surface was washed with 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, and 2% ethanol at 5 \u03bcl min\u22121 for 2.5 h. The response signal drops steadily due to His-CypA dissociating from the surface (phase b). Phase a2, where a slight drop in the response signal is observed during the injection phase, is likely due to a loss of rebinding [12] resulting from the relatively high concentration of His-CypA passed over the surface. For all concentrations of His-CypA tested (200 nM\u20131 \u03bcM), all of the initially immobilized protein could be completely dissociated form the Ni2+\u2013NTA surface after washing with running buffer for \u2a7e2 h (\u2217). (B) Following saturation of the RU signal (phases a1\u2013a2), a 30-s injection (at 15 \u03bcl min\u22121) of a mixture of NHS (115 mg ml\u22121) and EDC (750 mg ml\u22121) (phase c), followed immediately by a 30-s injection (at 15 \u03bcl min\u22121) of 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.5) (phase d), was performed. This brief covalent stabilization phase, via primary amine coupling, eliminates the slow dissociation of the histidine tag from the NTA moiety (phase b) on the sensor surface. The final amount of His-CypA covalently immobilized on the surface was between approximately 850 and 1600 RU.",

The average level of activity retained for the CM5 surface-immobilized CypA was 6.5%, and the level of activity retained for the single SA surface-immobilized CypA was 7%.

All three sensorgrams are essentially identical and lie on top of one another. Locally fitting the data (red lines) with a 1:1 complex model gave essentially identical values for the on- and off-rate constants (data not shown). (D) The covalently immobilized His-CypA surface is stable over long periods of time. The saturated response unit values (Rmax-CsA) are plotted versus time in hours for individual repeat runs of 1 \u03bcM CsA over the same NTA-His-CypA sensor surface. The mean value Rmax-CsA for this particular sensor surface was 61 RU (solid red line). The theoretical RUmax value for this surface is 72 RU (1203 RU of His-CypA immobilized).
