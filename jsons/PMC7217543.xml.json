Prominent examples are the mapping of the World Wide Web and structure of the Internet, social and financial networks, epidemiology, and language dynamics [1\u20134]. In the context of epidemic spreading the prediction of outbreaks has become particularly important for public health issues. The rapid growth in the velocity of transportation means and frequency of movements has further increased the risk that global emergent diseases such as H1N1 [5], SARS [6], or EBOV [7], and more recently ZIKV [8], will spread worldwide. The underlying mobility networks are usually scale-free [9]. This implies the absence of an epidemic threshold [10] that allows any transmittable disease to spread through the global population.",

At the global scale the different subpopulations, defined by the nodes of the network, are cities that can be connected by directed or undirected fluxes of individuals, provided by the worldwide transportation network data.

            "text": "In this work we introduce a network-based measure that generalizes the concept of distance and that provides fundamental insights into the dynamics of disease transmission as well as an efficient numerical estimation of the infection arrival time. We compare this effective distance [16] with the numerical estimate of the transmission times using a metapopulation model to validate the method. A series of papers have already been devoted to this problem [17\u201321]. Most of them rely on the concept of most probable path, the shortest-path effective distance DijSP for each source i and target j in the network. The latter can be defined, for both directed and undirected networks, as the geodesic graph distance with edge weights given by the first moment of a Gumbel distributed variable which depends only on the network topology and the infection rate. This shortest-path approach, however, significantly overestimates the infection arrival times [18,22]. A more realistic scenario takes into account all possible paths [19] yielding the multiple-path distance DijMP, which is better suited to estimate the arrival times of the infection. This method allows, at least in principle, to take into account all possible directed transmission paths, although the computation becomes infeasible as their number grows exponentially with the the number of vertices in the network. The lack of a practical computational approach leads back to considering only the shortest path. A logarithmic ad hoc edge weight transformation was introduced in Ref. [20] by simply requiring that adding edges should translate to multiplying the associated probabilities. This follows the intuitive argument that a higher number of passengers reduces the separation distance between neighboring nodes. This logarithmic transformation can be viewed as a log-space reduction [23] and, as we will show later, it can be derived as a special case of the shortest-path effective distance defined previously in Ref. [18]. The estimated arrival time TijAR from node i to node j, obtained from numerical simulations, correlates highly with the shortest-path effective distance. Using this metrics the complexity of disease transmission can be understood in terms of circular waves propagating at constant velocity from the infected node at time zero to all other nodes in the network [20]. The measure we introduce here aims to generalize previous definitions by including all walks that connect source and target.",

            "text": "Let us consider a metapopulation susceptible-infected-removed dynamics S\u2192\u03b2SII\u2192\u03bcIR, where \u03b2 and \u03bc are the infection and recovery rate, respectively. The nodes of the metapopulation network consists of subpopulations of constant size Nj, which divides into susceptible (Sj), infected (Ij), and removed (Rj) individuals\n(1)Nj=Sj(t)+Ij(t)+Rj(t).In the metapopulation in addition to the local SIR reaction dynamics, the movement of a host between populations i and j is governed by the master equation\n(2)\u2202tXj(t)=\u2211i\u2260jXi(t)Qij\u2212Xj(t)Qji.Here we introduced Xj(t)={Sj(t),Ij(t),Rj(t)} as a placeholder variable, and the transition rates Qij are defined as the conditional probability of a randomly chosen individual to jump from location i to location j within one time step\n(3)PXj(t+\u0394t)|Xi(t)\u2248Qij\u0394t,i\u2260j.The transition rates Qij can equivalently be defined in terms of the weighted adjacency matrix AijW as Qij=AijW/Ni\u2208[0,1]. The latter is obtained from the actual passenger fluxes between any two airports in the global mobility network used in the simulations [15]. This network consists of V=3865 vertices (airports) and E=51440 directed edges (fluxes), with very broad degree and weight distributions (see Figs. 1 and 2), where the high heterogeneity in the network connectivity is graphically reproduced. For the network diameter we found D=16 (connecting Stuart Island to Narsaq Kujalleq Heliport) and the global clustering coefficient is c=0.26\u00b10.01. A peculiar feature of this network is that the antisymmetric part of the fluxes \u03c7=AijW\u2212AjiW is vanishing to a high degree of accuracy so that it can be considered as undirected [24]. The weighted adjacency matrix of the undirected air traffic network is then defined by AijW=AijWij, where Aij is the adjacency matrix element and Wij\u22650 the corresponding weight. The symmetry in the adjacency matrix implies that for adjacent populations\n(4)AijW=QijNi=QjiNj=AjiW.The Markov transition matrix associated to the network can be written in terms of both the fluxes AijW and the local transition rates Qij:\n(5)Pij=AijW\u2211jAijW=Qij\u2211jQij,and it is row stochastic by construction. From (4) we also have the detailed balance\n(6)PijkiW=PjikjW,where we have introduced the weighted degree kiW=\u2211jAijW, sometimes denoted as strength [25], as the asymptotic probability distribution for the corresponding Markov chain. Thus using (6) we can rewrite (2), in terms of the compartment densities xj(t)=Xj(t)/Nj to obtain\n(7)\u2202txj(t)=1Nj\u2211i\u2260jxi(t)AijW\u2212xj(t)AjiW=kjWNj\u2211i\u2260jPjixi(t)\u2212xj(t).Furthermore, we can remove the dependence on the population size Nj by introducing a constant global mobility rate \u03b1. This parameter is defined as the ratio \u03b1=\u03a6/N, between the total daily passenger flux \u03a6=\u2211ijAijW and the total population N=\u2211iNi, i.e., the rate to leave a node for a randomly chosen individual. A local node dependent mobility rate can also be defined as\n(8)\u03b1i=\u2211jAijWNi=\u2211jQij.In the global mobility network data the total traffic of each node, i.e., its weighted degree kjW, is with a good accuracy proportional to its population Ni via the global mobility rate \u03b1, thus in our case \u03b1i=\u03b1\u2200i. The complete SIR dynamics of the Rvachev-Longini model [20,26] becomes\n(9)\u2202tsj(t)=\u03a9sj(t)\u2212\u03b2sj(t)ij(t)\u2202tij(t)=\u03a9ij(t)+\u03b2sj(t)ij(t)\u2212\u03bcij(t)\u2202trj(t)=\u03a9rj(t)+\u03bcij(t),where the mobility function for each compartment density xj=Xj/Nj,\n(10)\u03a9({xj})=\u03b1\u2211i\u2260jPjixi(t)\u2212xj(t),accounts for diffusion along the nodes.\n\n",

Assuming Qij\u0394t\u226a1 we can derive a probability density function for the infection hitting time hj to city j of the Gumbel type [18]. The first moment of this distribution is given by\n(12)\u2329hj\u232ai=1\u03b2ln\u03b2Qij\u2212\u03b3e,where \u03b3e\u22480.5772 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and the average \u2329\u22ef\u232ai is taken over times starting at ti=0. Using (5) we find\n(13)\u03b2\u2329hj\u232ai=ln\u03b2\u2211jQij\u2212\u03b3e\u2212lnQij\u2211jQij=\u03b4\u2212lnPij,where we assume the mobility rate (8) to be node independent, i.e., \u03b1i=\u03b1\u2200i and \u03b4=ln(\u03b2/\u03b1)\u2212\u03b3e is a dimensionless parameter. This result can easily be generalized to the SIR model and a network with an arbitrary number of nodes simply by minimizing the quantity \u2329hl\u232ak for each consecutive link (k,l) that belongs to the path \u0393ij connecting source i to target j. For the arbitrary heterogenous population and network topology with an arbitrary number of nodes by taking the minimum over all paths yields the shortest-path effective distance\n(14)DijSP(\u03b4)\u2261min{\u0393ij}\u2211(k,l)\u2208\u0393ij\u03b4\u2212lnPkl\u2248(\u03b2\u2212\u03bc)\u2329hj\u232ai,where for the SIR metapopulation dynamics we have\n(15)\u03b4=ln\u03b2\u2212\u03bc\u03b1\u2212\u03b3e.Since each term in the sum is strictly positive, one can obtain the complete shortest-path distance matrix for each source and target pair using the Dijkstra algorithm [28] in a time O(VE+V2logV), where E and V are the graph size and order, respectively. The effective distance defined in Ref. [20] can then be recovered as a special case of (14) simply by setting the scale parameter \u03b4 to unity. This fact allows for a deeper and more complete understanding of this effective distance and offers a more solid explanation to the extremely high correlation with the infection arrival time found in Ref. [20]. The most important limitation of (14) is that only one path is considered, namely, the path that in addition to minimizing the topological length also maximizes the probability associated to that. Thus in this scenario the contribution to the disease spread comes only from a single route. The effective infection arrival time DijSP(\u03b4)/VEF, where VEF\u2248\u03b2\u2212\u03bc is the linearized effective speed of the infection [18,20], is in fact overestimated with respect to the simulations result TijAR [22].",

Relation (16) can then be easily generalized to an arbitrary number of multiple paths as\n(18)exp\u2212DijMP(\u03b4)=\u2211{\u0393ij}exp[\u2212D\u0393ij(\u03b4)],so that we obtain\n(19)DijMP(\u03b4)=\u2212ln\u2211{\u0393ij}e\u2212nij\u03b4Fij(\u0393ij).Here we have defined the total probability associated to the path \u0393ij as\n(20)Fij(\u0393ij)=\u220f(k,l)\u2208\u0393ijPkl.By grouping all probabilities associated to paths of the same length in the quantity Fij(n)=\u2211|\u0393ij|=nFij(\u0393ij), we can replace in (19) the sum over all paths connecting i to j with a sum over integer path lengths to get\n(21)DijMP(\u03b4)=\u2212ln\u2211n=1nmaxe\u2212n\u03b4Fij(n),where nmax is the maximum path length in the network. If we select the path \u0393ij~ of length n~ that is associated to the dominant contribution, i.e., the path that maximize its associated probability and minimizes the topological path length, one recovers the shortest-path effective distance of (14)\n(22)DijMP~(\u03b4)=n~\u03b4\u2212lnFij(n~)=DijSP(\u03b4).Therefore the multiple-path distance gives a more accurate estimate of the infection arrival time, as it allows to take into account the most probable route as well as all possible alternative transmission routes.

Relaxing the assumption of directed spread is equivalent to effectively erasing the memory from the system at each time step. This is achieved by including in (19) all walks \u039eij, which contrary to the paths \u0393ij, allow also already visited nodes. We define the random-walk effective distance by generalizing (19) as\n(23)DijRW(\u03b4)=\u2212ln\u2211{\u039eij}e\u2212nij\u03b4Hij(\u039eij),where Hij(\u039eij) is the probability associated to a walk that starts in i and arrives to j. As for the probabilities Fij we can group the probabilities associated to walks of the same length into Hij(n)=\u2211|\u039eij|=nHij(\u039eij). The latter is precisely the hitting time probability for a Markov chain defined recursively as [29]\n(24)Hij(n)=\u2211k\u2260jPikHkj(n).Thus Hij(n) is simply the nth power of the subtransition probability matrix obtained by removing the jth row and column. Contrary to the multiple-path scenario now the walks are unbounded and so becomes nmax.

The proposed random-walk effective distance includes the previously defined shortest-path measure as a particular case. The remarkable correlation found with the infection arrival time can be explained as follows. The contribution of looped trajectories in the propagation of physical information is neglected because of the decreasing exponential in the walk length. The latter serves as damping such contributions for long walks, and in particular allows us to neglect infinite loop contributions. In scenarios where multiple parallel paths are important, for instance, in Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs or regular lattices, the assumption of a single dominant path breaks down, and the measure proposed here can be used as an efficient alternative. The predictive power of the random-walk effective distance can be used for containment strategies and estimation of arrival times for real global pandemics from the underlying networks topology. The random-walk metric can in fact be generally applied to any weighted and directed network besides the transportation ones, for instance, in the context of social interactions and rumor spreading. For unweighted locally treelike networks both the shortest-path and random-walk effective distances yield maximum correlation with the simulated arrival time, as the shortest path tends to dominate.",
