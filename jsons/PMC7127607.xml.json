The increasing role of wildlife in the emergence of livestock and human diseases is due to multiple changes occurring within wildlife, livestock, and human populations, as well as at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface (Jones et al., 2008). Human driven land use change\u2014which frequently includes encroachment into wildlife habitat\u2014continues to increase along with more intensified livestock production practices (Daszak et al., 2001, Patz et al., 2004). Alteration of wildlife population demographics, such as larger deer populations, increases the potential for contact and pathogen transmission at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface (Rhyan and Spraker, 2010).",

Globally, the role of wildlife in livestock diseases is expected to increase (Siembieda et al., 2011) in conjunction with human population growth, which is expected to reach 9 billion by 2030. This will create increased demand for animal protein thereby increasing livestock populations (Anonymous, 2004). The demand will further increase potentially infectious contacts between livestock and wildlife leading to an increased potential for new zoonotic diseases to emerge. All of these challenges will require an improved understanding of the ecology of pathogens at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface along with development of tools and mitigations to manage these pathogens.",

Conflicting agency and institutional missions, program goals, and cultural differences that limit the potential for developing comprehensive mitigation of pathogen transmission contribute to hampering efforts in this area. Nevertheless, research and policy at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface has received increased attention in recent years with the number of scientific publications in English journals addressing this topic rising dramatically (Fig. 1\n). This is driven, though not exclusively, by a rapid increase in the number of zoonotic disease events associated with wildlife in the latter part of the 20th century (Dobson and Foufopoulos, 2001, Ostfeld and Holt, 2004, Decker et al., 2010). Three-fourths of all emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of humans are zoonotic with most originating in wildlife (Taylor and Latham, 2001, Jones et al., 2008). A large proportion (77%) of livestock pathogens\u2014and an even higher proportion (91%) of carnivore pathogens\u2014infect multiple hosts including wildlife (Cleaveland et al., 2001). Therefore, diseases that arise from the livestock\u2013wildlife interface are of paramount importance and must be an area of focus for animal health authorities (Siembieda et al., 2011).",

The 1999 Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia destroyed the Malaysian swine industry while the associated human fatalities simultaneously created massive public panic (Epstein et al., 2006a).

In contrast to conventional thinking, livestock have introduced several pathogens, such as bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis bacterium, to na\u00efve wildlife populations in North America. These two pathogens are found in at least five wildlife populations (Tessaro, 1986, Sweeney and Miller, 2010) and create significant challenges for disease control at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface. In some instances, spillover events from livestock into wildlife impact conservation of species of concern (Dobson and Foufopoulos, 2001, Nishi et al., 2002, Joly and Messier, 2005, Cross et al., 2007). An example is the transmission and introduction of bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis from livestock into native wood bison (Bison bisonathabascae) populations in Canada, which has created a conservation challenge for the species (Tessaro et al., 1990, Nishi et al., 2002). Another well-publicized example is the introduction of brucellosis into native bison and elk populations of the Yellowstone ecosystem in 1917 (Meagher and Meyer, 1994, Meyer and Meagher, 1995). This resulted in a wildlife management challenge due to conflicts between livestock and bison preservation.",

Obstacles faced by wildlife managers and livestock authorities for mitigating contact between wildlife and livestock has resulted in significant efforts to develop technology that reduces contact and is economically feasible. However, development of effective tools that can be readily deployed has been met with a host of challenges. Many devices prove to be ineffective or only effective for a short duration (VerCauteren et al., 2005, VerCauteren et al., 2006a). The most successful tools have involved fencing technology (e.g. high fence, wire mesh, electrified high-tensile steel wire, or polytape) that reduces contact between wildlife and livestock feed (VerCauteren et al., 2006b, VerCauteren et al., 2007). However, fencing suffers from limitations such as the need for relatively frequent maintenance. More recently, research has focused on the use of historic tools such as livestock protection dogs to prevent contact between livestock and wildlife. In some cases these traditional tools have proven to be the most effective (VerCauteren et al., 2008, VerCauteren et al., 2010). In addition to the challenges faced in developing effective mitigation tools is gaining social acceptance of their use by farmers, which is fundamental in successfully using these tools (Brook and McLachlan, 2006). However, there remains a need for identifying new economically feasible tools that wildlife and livestock managers can deploy to reduce contact at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface.",

Many countries, have developed passive and active surveillance systems for EID events in wildlife. Some of the earliest systems were developed in Denmark (1930s) and Sweden (1940s) however surveillance systems are established in Norway, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States (Morner et al., 2002, Pedersen et al., 2012). The United Kingdom (Sainsbury et al., 2001, Lysons et al., 2007, Hartley and Gill, 2010, Hartley and Lysons, 2011) has developed a program to implement integrated risk management and EID monitoring systems for wildlife. These nascent emerging systems have common themes, which may be adaptable to the United States. In the existing literature, five interdependent aspects of disease management are suggested as being necessary for successfully addressing disease issues at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface: (1) horizon scanning (issue identification); (2) risk analysis and assessment; (3) risk mitigation; (4) surveillance and monitoring; and (5) disease control and management. These components, described as integrating sequentially with feedback loops, incorporate learning about the system. As information about the disease agent is improved, management is adapted thereby improving actions performed in the other components (Fig. 2\n). This process of adaptive management has been well described in the ecological and wildlife management literature (Kendall, 2001, McCarthy and Possingham, 2007), but concepts related to adaptive management have only recently been proposed as a method for managing disease systems (Thirgood, 2009, Wasserberg et al., 2009).",

There is mounting concern over the zoonotic potential, and subsequent wide-ranging socioeconomic impacts, associated with wildlife-borne EIDs (Jones et al., 2008). Recent examples of EIDs emerging from wildlife include Nipah virus in swine (Chua et al., 2000), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans (Riley et al., 2003), and H5N1 HPAI in domestic poultry, wild birds, and humans (Ferguson et al., 2004). In addition, new issues continue to emerge with well-documented disease systems, such as bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis influencing agricultural systems and wildlife management in North America (Olsen, 2010a, O\u2019Brien et al., 2011). Other EID's of concern to agriculture are certain to emerge in the future, some of which may disperse rapidly across broad geographic scales (Cleaveland et al., 2001, Siembieda et al., 2011). The risks of existing and new EID's to disperse rapidly highlight the need for robust systems for early identification of pathogens, which may have important health, social, economic, or other management consequences.",

In the case of animal disease, risk analysis is an important tool used to identify and characterize the potential risks posed by implementation of policy or by specific events such as importation of livestock. Risk analyses form the foundation from which animal health policy is established. However, for diseases at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface, quantitative risk assessments are often difficult. Challenges for conducting quantitative risk assessments often result from incomplete information related to the disease status of wildlife or limited understanding of the potential contact between wildlife and livestock leading to pathogen transmission. In addition accurate quantitative data describing the spatial distribution, movement, population structure, and population density are typically unavailable limiting inference to the population or understanding population level risk factors.",

Risk assessments often assess the risk of pathogen transmission from wildlife to livestock (Daniels et al., 2003). However, for many diseases of livestock in North America (e.g. bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis) the initial transmission event is from livestock to wildlife, which in some cases results in the establishment of a wildlife reservoir for the pathogen posing continued risks to livestock (Tessaro, 1986, Sweeney and Miller, 2010). For these reasons the most successful and useful risk analyses consider the bi-directional nature of transmission and address questions of risk using statistical methods to explicitly incorporate uncertainty. In addition, studies that estimate contact between livestock and wildlife to understand potential for pathogen transmission are needed.",

The ability to eliminate livestock pathogens from North American wildlife populations has been rare and when successful required extensive culling of wildlife. An example is the eradication of foot-and-mouth disease from the United States in 1925 which required the culling of 22,000 deer from the Stanislaus National Forest in California (Williams and Barker, 2001). Wildlife removal strategies can have unintended consequence, which was exemplified in the United Kingdom where wildlife behavior was changed as a result of culling increasing the risk of bovine tuberculosis transmission to cattle (Woodroffe et al., 2009). In addition protected wildlife can complicate control or eradication efforts to control disease (Meyer and Meagher, 1995). Eradication efforts requiring the culling of large numbers of wildlife are likely untenable in the United States today, thus preventing establishment of livestock diseases in wildlife populations is a central pillar of long-term risk mitigation strategies.",

            "text": "The need to develop comprehensive surveillance systems that integrate livestock, wildlife, and human components has been suggested (M\u00f6rner et al., 2002). Robust surveillance systems in wildlife and at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface to provide early detection of newly emerging EIDs or spillover and spillback of pathogens between livestock and wildlife is essential. Developing a comprehensive national monitoring system for EIDs in wildlife that is logistically and fiscally sustainable could yield economic benefits for livestock health management as a whole by reducing indemnity costs associated with spillover of disease from wildlife to livestock or by helping prevent spillover from livestock to wildlife through early detection. The objectives of such a system could be enhanced by close integration with existing livestock and wildlife health programs to guide \u201cwhen\u201d, \u201cwhere\u201d, and \u201chow\u201d surveillance is conducted. In addition, existing programs would benefit from closer working relationships between wildlife biologists, ecologists, epidemiologists, and veterinarians to improve efforts focused on reducing pathogen transmission (Boadella et al., 2011). One obstacle to developing long-term, comprehensive surveillance efforts at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface is inconsistent funding for these activities (Leighton et al., 1997, Stitt et al., 2007). Funding has typically been in response to emergency directives (e.g. HPAI H5N1 surveillance) and focused for a short period until the threat is perceived to no longer exist. This has, predictably, generated problems for developing a comprehensive national infrastructure that can be maintained over the long-term. In addition, there are disease systems that have plagued agriculture for decades, such as bovine tuberculosis, that do not obtain sufficient levels of funding to fully address risks for introduction into new wildlife hosts such as feral swine (Sweeney and Miller, 2010). Another challenge faced by wildlife surveillance systems is that they often rely on hunter observations and reports, which are focused on game species. This increases the difficulty of identifying emergence of disease in non-game species. Finally, due to challenges associated with working across agency departmental boundaries, such as reduced communication, differing priorities, perceived competition in missions, and cultural differences wildlife surveillance efforts often remain less than fully coordinated which reduces their overall benefit.",

Developing collaborations often proves difficult even mandated from the highest levels of government, as exemplified by continued outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in several countries (FAO et al., 2008). The United States suffers from similar limitations, due in part to the bicameral regulatory and legal authority for oversight of livestock and wildlife. States have clear ownership of wildlife; Federal regulatory authorities do not always extend to control disease in livestock to manage the disease in wildlife. Thus, the effective control of disease incursions from wildlife to livestock requires State and Federal livestock management agencies to foster positive working relationships with wildlife agencies. Unfortunately, such relationships frequently have not been developed resulting in a decision making process on livestock disease management in which wildlife appear as an afterthought, when often they are integral to disease maintenance and spread. Involving all relevant stakeholders (i.e. livestock industry, wildlife conservation groups, wildlife health authorities, livestock health authorities, etc.) in the development of regional or ecosystem-level livestock disease management planning, from the beginning of the process, increases the likelihood of success (Loomis, 2002).",

Several have noted that one of the most important constraints to managing brucellosis in Yellowstone is jurisdictional inertia, or the unwillingness of agencies to relinquish their existing domains of territorial control (Lavigne, 2002, McBeth and Shanahan, 2004). This example underscores the need for wildlife, human, and agricultural agencies to develop strong working relationships prior to emergence of disease.

Experience in many countries, including the United States and Canada, has shown that while bTB can be controlled when restricted to livestock species, it is almost impossible to eradicate this disease once it has spread into ecosystems with free-ranging maintenance hosts. Recent epidemiological models suggest that once bTB is introduced, the probability of becoming established in a wildlife population once introduced is at least 10% (Ramsey et al., 2011).

However, M. bovis has been isolated from free-ranging swine (i.e. wild boar and feral swine) in at least 15 countries (Letts, 1964, Corner et al., 1981, Essey et al., 1981, O\u2019Reilly and Daborn, 1995, Aranaz et al., 1996, Serraino et al., 1999, Palmer, 2007). New evidence from Mediterranean ecosystems supports the role of wild swine as maintenance hosts of bTB\u2014sustaining infection and transmitting the pathogen to other species (Aranaz et al., 1996, Naranjo et al., 2008). Circumstances favoring bTB transmission between wildlife and livestock in the Mediterranean include artificial increases in wild game populations stimulated by a robust hunting industry, feeding and baiting of wildlife, and intensive cattle grazing in proximity to wild swine (Hermoso de Mendoza et al., 2006). All of these characteristics likely apply to conditions in North America. Particularly worrisome is the recent appearance of feral swine in the state of Michigan where the potential exists for interaction with bTB-infected white-tailed deer and cattle. Regions of the southern United States also pose a risk where high densities of feral swine, an established hunting industry, significant baiting and feeding of wildlife, and introductions of bTB infected cattle from Mexico continue to occur (Sweeney and Miller, 2010). Furthermore recent evidence indicates that M. bovis may be present in free ranging white-tailed deer in northern Mexico. One study report the presence of M. tuberculosis complex identified using amplification of DNA from a tissue by PCR (Barrios-Garc\u00eda et al., 2012). The authors also report histopathology consistent with M. bovis infection observed in white-tailed deer. Another study reported the frequent detection of antibodies against mycobacterium antigens in a cross-sectional survey of white-tailed deer in Northern Mexico (Medrano et al., 2012).",

Developing national policies and working relationships across agencies responsible for domestic and wildlife health at the State and Federal level would have long-term benefits for preventing the risk of introduction of bTB into new wildlife host populations.",

To successfully manage and control these pathogens at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface will require the development of cross-discipline collaborations and establishing common goals between agencies and organizations that in some cases have rarely worked together. We believe the principles of adaptive management offer the greatest opportunities to formulate a framework from which collaborations can be developed to manage diseases at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface. EID monitoring systems for wildlife that incorporate and implement integrated risk management in an adaptive management framework offer the best opportunity for success. In addition, new and creative funding mechanisms that bring livestock and wildlife animal health authorities along with livestock industry and wildlife stakeholders together will need to be created. Despite these social and policy challenges, there remain opportunities to develop new collaborations\u2014along with the development of new technologies\u2014to mitigate disease risks at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface. We believe that two diseases eradication programs\u2014bovine tuberculosis and cattle fever tick\u2014offer the best opportunity to apply these principles and demonstrate success.",
