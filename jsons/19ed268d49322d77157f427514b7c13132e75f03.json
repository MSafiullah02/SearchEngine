However, a fair amount of steady-state, resident macrophages is present in myocardial tissue [3, 4] . These macrophages originate from yolk sac and fetal monocytic progenitors and are either replenished by local proliferation in infancy [3] or by blood monocytes in adulthood [4] . At birth, resident macrophages express major histocompatibility complex class II (HLA II) molecules and the CX3CR1+ Fractalkine receptor and are therefore distinct from conventional \u03b1E integrin CD103+ dendritic cells [5] . With age, the number of HLA II macrophages increases while the number of CX 3 CR 1 + macrophages decreases [6] ; the proliferation capacity of embryo-derived cardiac macrophages progressively declines after the perinatal period [6] . Cardiac-resident macrophages display distinct functional properties from those of monocyte-derived macrophages in cardiac tissue. Resident macrophages interweave a complex molecular dialogue with cardiac myocytes, likely mediated by cytokines; macrophages can modulate the different signals that originate from the injured cardiac tissue [7] . In cardiac inflammatory diseases, resident macrophages likely participate in attracting circulating monocytes and other inflammatory cells, depending on the local signal triggering the inflammation [8] .

The understanding of mechanisms of myocardial inflammation in infectious and non-infectious myocarditis is challenging, as it is difficult to understand whether individual constitutional gene variants can influence these mechanisms.

Infectious myocarditis can be caused by DNA and RNA viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths. The most common causes of infectious myocarditis in both children and adults are cardiotropic viruses [9] . Non-viral cardiotropic infections such as Trypanosoma Cruzi (Chagas disease) [10] and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) [11] can affect immune-competent individuals in endemic areas. In immunocompromised patients, typically heart transplant recipients, the most common opportunistic infections include the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Toxoplasma gondii. The state of knowledge on the etiology, diagnosis, management, and therapy of myocarditis and that on the diagnosis and management of myocardial involvement in systemic immune-mediated diseases are reported in two position statements of the European Society of cardiology [12, 13] . Precise rules define the criteria for the diagnosis of systemic and organ involvement [14] , including the heart. Myocardial involvement is diagnosed when the infectious agent is detected in myocardial tissue by pathologic and pathogen-related genomic studies [12, 13] . Often, in clinical practice, the diagnosis of myocarditis is suspected, based more on clinical, biochemical, and imaging criteria than on the demonstration of myocardial tissue inflammation. Failure to precisely diagnose the cause can lead to overlooking a potentially toxic origin (e.g., pheochromocytoma) [15] and genetic familial diseases with similar clinical expression. Resuscitated cardiac arrest is one of the examples in which imaging-detected interstitial edema [15] can lead to incorrect diagnostic hypotheses. As expected, infectious myocarditis is not a genetic disease; in the absence of the pathogen, there is no myocarditis. However, the role of genetic susceptibility has been repeatedly raised in clinical and experimental studies in an attempt to understand why some individuals develop myocarditis, while others, perhaps exposed to the same risk, do not.

The question is whether genetically affected hearts are more vulnerable to inflammatory triggers than nonaffected hearts [2, 31] . A recent in vitro and clinical study explored the hypothesis that human genetic factors might underlie acute viral myocarditis in previously healthy children. Authors tested the role of TLR3-interferon (IFN) immunity using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) and performed whole-exome sequencing in 42 unrelated children with acute myocarditis, some with proven viral etiologies. TLR3-and STAT1-deficient iPSC-CM did not show more susceptibility to coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection than control cells. CVB3 did not induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-stimulated genes in control cardiomyocytes and exogenous IFN-\u03b1 did not substantially protect cardiomyocytes against CVB3. Exome sequencing did not show mutations in TLR3-or IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-related genes. Unexpectedly, seven of 42 patients (16.7%) were carriers of rare bi-allelic, nonsynonymous, or splice-site variations in six cardiomyopathy-associated genes (BAG3, DSP, PKP2, RYR2, SCN5A, or TNNI3). The authors concluded that \"previously silent recessive defects of the myocardium may predispose to acute heart failure presenting as acute myocarditis, notably after common viral infections\" [32] . The hypothesis that acute myocarditis reflects an active phase of ARVD that leads to changes in phenotype and abrupt progression of the disease has been investigated by Lopez-Ayala and colleagues [33] . They suggest that an active phase should be suspected in a patient with myocarditis associated with a family history of ARVD and that certain mutations may increase the susceptibility to superimposed myocarditis in ARVD [33] . Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy caused by defects of dystrophin and dysferlin demonstrate increased susceptibility to myocardial CVB3 infection by enhancing viral propagation to adjacent cardiomyocytes and disrupting the function that repairs the myocyte membrane [34] [35] [36] . The history of a recent flu episode in patients with XL-DCM caused by defects of dystrophin may confound the true clinical diagnosis, but the possibility that a viral flu triggers or unmasks the manifestation of preexisting asymptomatic disease cannot be excluded. Although myocarditis and the viral genome may not be found in the EMB from patients with XL-DCM [37] , the myocardium with dystrophin defects could sustain greater damage from coxsackievirus proteases that are known to affect host cell proteins such as dystrophin [34] [35] [36] [37] . As confirmation of the role or effect of myocarditis on the expression of dystrophin, there is evidence of focal disruption of the dystrophinglycoprotein complex (DGC) in human coxsackievirus B myocarditis. DGC disruption can contribute to the pathogenesis of human enterovirus (EV)-induced dilated cardiomyopathy [38] , and the disintegration of the sarcoglycan complex may, in addition to dystrophin cleavage, play an important role in the pathogenesis of enterovirus-induced cardiomyopathy [39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 505, "end": 508, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 509, "end": 512, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1683, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1886, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2109, "end": 2113, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2385, "end": 2389, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2390, "end": 2394, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2395, "end": 2399, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2763, "end": 2767, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2931, "end": 2935, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2936, "end": 2940, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2941, "end": 2945, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2946, "end": 2950, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3267, "end": 3271, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3446, "end": 3450, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Non-immunity Genes: Do Genetic Cardiomyopathies Display Susceptibility to Myocarditis?"}, {"text": "The clinical presentation of EV infection may be relatively mild (fever, herpangina, conjunctivitis, hand-foot-mouth disease, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, lower respiratory tract infection, acute gastroenteritis) or, less commonly, very severe (pneumonia, meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, pericarditis, hepatic necrosis, and coagulopathy) [40] . EV myocarditis is often described in outbreaks of EV infections [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] ( Table 4 .2). The cardiotropic coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3) is one of the most common causes of myocarditis [40] . The myocardial infection is initiated by the transmembrane coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) encoded by the CXADR gene (MIM * 602621); in experimental models, the ablation of CAR blocks viral infection of myocardial cells as well as inflammation in the myocardium [47] . Similarly, increased cardiac expression of CAR may partially explain increased susceptibility to myocarditis [48] . However, to date, mutations in the CXADR gene have not been reported/identified. In CVB3-infected myocytes, the cell damage is induced by direct cytotoxicity and mediated by viral proteinases [49] .

A recent investigation focuses on PI4KB/ACBD3 (phosphatidylinositol kinase 4, type 3 beta/acyl-CoAbinding domain-containing protein 3) interaction as facilitating mechanisms for efficient viral replication. Enteroviruses, as well as other positive-strand RNA viruses, reorganize host cellular membranes through recruiting phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase (PI4KB), whose defects cause the monogenic autosomal recessive perisylvian polymicrogyria, with cerebellar hypoplasia and arthrogryposis [54] . Acute inhibition of the enzyme PI4KA by kinase inhibitors causes sudden death [55] . The Golgi-residing protein, ACBD3 (Golgi phosphoprotein 1; GOLPH1), which is involved in the maintenance of Golgi structure and function, is responsible for proper localization of enteroviral 3A proteins in host cells. Mutants abrogating the ACBD3-PI4KB interaction showed that this interaction is crucial for enterovirus replication and allowed the identification of the minimal ACBD3 domains that are essential for enterovirus replication. Therefore, acyl-coenzyme A binding (ACB) and charged-amino-acid region (CAR) domains are dispensable for 3A-mediated PI4KB recruitment and efficient enterovirus replication [56] .

It may also infect non-erythroid lineage cells such as myocardial endothelial cells [60] . The tropism of B19V for EPCs depends on the expression of viral receptors and coreceptors on the cell surface and by the viral use of host factors such as RNA binding motif protein 38 (RBM38) for the processing of its pre-mRNA during viral replication [61] . Variants in RBM38 gene have not been reported so far. The RBM38 protein (coded by the RBM38 gene, 20q13.31, MIM * 612428) interacts with the intronic splicing enhancer 2 (ISE2) element of B19V pre-mRNA and promotes 11-kDa protein expression that regulates the 11-kDa protein-mediated augmentation of B19V replication [62] . The B19V-antibody complex enters the cells through an endocytosis process mediated by the direct interaction of antibody-bound complement factor C1q with its receptor CD93 on the cell surface [63] . Infection by PVB19 causes fifth disease, arthropathy, anemia in immunocompromised patients and sickle cell disease patients, myocarditis, and hydrops fetalis in pregnant women [64] [65] [66] . The cardiac manifestations vary, from mild and nonspecific symptoms (e.g., fatigue, arrhythmias) to severe, including cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical support. PCR-based studies have reported B19V genome in myocardial tissue of patients with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy, however also in control cases, disproving the hypothesis that persistent myocardial viral infection might be a frequent cause of DCM or myocarditis [67] [68] [69] . Similar findings have been reported in skin samples from patients with dermatological diseases in which the role of viral infection is debated [70] . It should be considered that no biopsy tissue sample is blood-free. In addition, remnant B19V DNA strands can be released from tissues without active viral replication; therefore, the PCR-based detection of B19V DNA in blood does not prove the presence of infectious virions and viral replication [71] . This finding suggests caution in the interpretation of the role of B19V infection when based on B19V DNA detection in blood, not only in myocarditis but also in other diseases that have been hypothesized to be causally linked with B19V. Finally, the viral load of PVB19 genomes in the myocardium is not related to the long-term outcome [72] .

The clinical manifestations depend upon the tissues involved, including synovium (arthritis), heart valves (endocarditis), myocardium (pancarditis), brain [91] a Inflammatory bowel disease, immunodeficiency, and encephalopathy (Sydenham's chorea), kidney (glomerulonephritis), skin (erythema marginatum), and subcutaneous tissue (rheumatic nodules).

Rheumatic fever is an example of familial \"non-genetic aggregation\" and of difficulties in distinguishing familial genetic susceptibility from transient or persistent environmental factors to which members of the same families may be exposed. Historical research focused attention on family aggregation [96] , exploring the field of immunogenetics. An early study published in Nature in 1979 [97] identified the B-cell alloantigen marker, 883, in patients previously diagnosed with RF with or without subsequent RHD. The 883 antigen on B cells was found in 71% of patients typed in New York and 74% of patients typed in Bogota as compared with 17% in the two disease-free control groups. The marker was not associated with any of the known major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. A later study showed that two antibodies produced against this antigen were present in 92% of patients as compared with 21% of disease-free controls [98] . Another monoclonal antibody, labeled D8/17, which identified a B-cell antigen present in 100% of RF patients, was found in 14.6 and 13% of unaffected sibs and parents, respectively. The segregation of phenotypes (percentage D8/17-positive cells within HLA-typed rheumatic fever families) was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, which was not associated with the MHC gene system [99] . The D8/17 antibody was later considered a disease-specific marker with worldwide distribution: it may serve as a diagnostic tool in patients with suspected rheumatic fever [100] . Therefore, the hypothesis of an autosomal familial recessive predisposition/susceptibility that was not related to HLA genes remains doubtful. Nonetheless, more recent twin pairs' studies demonstrated a concordant risk for acute rheumatic fever of 44% in monozygotic twins and 12% in dizygotic twins. The estimated heritability across six meta-analyzed studies was 60% [101] . Genetic variants associated with increased risk of RHD have been investigated on the basis of the hypothesis that cytokine gene polymorphisms could play a role in the susceptibility of RHD in patients: TNF-\u03b1 (-308G>A) and IL-1\u03b2 (-511C>T) were significantly associated with increased risk of RHD, while IL-10 (-1082G>A) and IL-6 (-174G>C) were not associated with modified RHD risk [102] . Thereafter, research focused on the role of functional variants in genes encoding molecules of the complement activation pathways. The rationale is that tissue damage in RHD is mediated by autoantibodies resulting from molecular mimicry between GAS and cardiac tissue proteins. The GAS molecule N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and the M protein cross-react with valve and myocyte proteins of the host [103] . GlcNAc is the immunodominant cell wall antigenic epitope of GAS and is recognized by ficolins [104] that comprise pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the complement [103, 105] . Of the three human ficolins [ficolin-1 (M-ficolin), ficolin-2 (L-ficolin), and ficolin-3 (H-ficolin also known as Hakata antigen)] [106] , ficolin-1 is found both in soluble form and on the cell membrane [107] [108] [109] and binds sialic acid to capsular polysaccharides of pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae [110, 111] . The levels of expression of ficolin-1 are influenced by promoter gene variants, all associated with increased FCN1 gene expression in whole blood or adipose subcutaneous tissue, but are also associated with increased protection against the disease [112, 113] . FCN1 polymorphisms may play a dual role in the physiopathology of RF. On the one hand, they increase the GAS infection and predispose the patient to RHD symptoms, once the infection is established [113] . Polymorphisms associated with low levels of L-ficolin level may predispose carriers to recurrent and/or more severe streptococcal infection [112] . The low levels of ficolin-1 levels reported in RHD have been interpreted as an effect of the considerable ficolin-1 consumption in RF (Table 4 .4). In any case, ficolin-1 is a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases [114] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 186, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 492, "end": 496, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 581, "end": 585, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1131, "text": "[98]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1529, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1709, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 2081, "end": 2086, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2475, "text": "[102]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 2881, "end": 2886, "text": "[103]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 2983, "end": 2988, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 3058, "end": 3063, "text": "[103,", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 3064, "end": 3068, "text": "105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 3202, "end": 3207, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 3275, "end": 3280, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 3281, "end": 3286, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 3287, "end": 3292, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 3391, "end": 3396, "text": "[110,", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 3397, "end": 3401, "text": "111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 3652, "end": 3657, "text": "[112,", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 3658, "end": 3662, "text": "113]", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 3862, "end": 3867, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 4010, "end": 4015, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 4247, "end": 4252, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4152, "end": 4160, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Familial Susceptibility"}, {"text": "FLC3 gene defects are associated with immunodeficiency due to ficolin-3 deficiency (MIM # 613860), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by increased susceptibility to infections and autoimmune diseases, and by defect in the lectin activation pathway of the complement system.

SNPs in major histocompatibility complex HLA-DRA and BTNL2 genes have been associated with susceptibility to sarcoidosis. A recent multi-population study demonstrates that at least a part of these associations are HLA-DRB1 independent (unrelated with linkage disequilibrium) and shared across ancestral origins.

GCM is currently considered a \"multifactorial disease triggered by different causes\" . Etiologic hypotheses include systemic autoimmune diseases [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] , drug toxicity [169] , infections [170] [171] [172] , and complex combination of autoimmunity, infections and drug toxicity [173] . Infections reported in GCM include coxsackie B2 virus [170] , parvovirus B19 [171] , HCMV [172] and HIV1 infection [173] [174] [175] [176] [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] [182] [183] [184] . In most cases, GCM is an isolated entity, while in about one-fifth of cases GCM occurs in association with autoimmune/immune-mediated diseases (Table 4 .7), infections, drug toxicity, or syndromes such as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [173, 184, 185] or even in patients taking common medications such as amoxicillin [183] . To date, the autoimmune/ immune-mediated hypothesis is the most accredited pathogenic theory supported both by the aforementioned associations with systemic autoimmune diseases (Table 4 .7) and by the partial remission of GCM in patients treated with immunosuppression as well as by the non-aggressive occurrence (10-50%) of the disease during immunosuppression treatment in transplanted patients [186, 187] . Clinical manifestations of GCM are variable. Most patients present with cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure, requiring mechanical circulatory support. However, conduction disease such as atrio-ventricular nodal or infra-nodal heart block or atrial or ventricular arrhythmias can be the first manifestation. The rare \"atrial variant\" is characterized by atrial fibrillation and severe atrial dilation but preserved ventricular function [188, 189] . A precise diagnosis of GCM is established only when typical pathologic features are demonstrated on EMB or surgical samples [190] (Fig. 4.4) . The inflammatory infiltrate is constituted by CD8-positive lymphocytes, eosinophils, and multinucleated giant cells; myocytes show damage and necrosis [162, 163] . The origin of giant cells, from myocytes and/or histiocytes, remains a matter of investigation. Differential diagnosis between GCM and cardiac sarcoidosis relies on pathologic features (non-caseating epithelioid granulomas with CD68-positive giant cells in sarcoidosis) and is supported by the different T-cell subsets, CD4+ in sarcoidosis and CD8+ in GCM. GCM carries a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 5.5 months from the onset of symptoms; up to 90% patients either die or require cardiac transplantation.

Late phases are characterized by endocardial fibrosis manifesting with restrictive physiology. Valve regurgitation occurs when mural endocardial thrombosis and fibrosis involve mitral or tricuspid valve leaflets [214, 215] . Cardiac involvement is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HES [216] [217] [218] [219] . The disease course is divided into three stages: (1) an acute necrotic stage, (2) a thrombotic stage, and (3) a fibrotic stage. The early, acute necrotic stage is characterized by eosinophilic and lymphocytic infiltration; eosinophils undergo degranulation in the myocardial interstitium, releasing biologically active factors that cause myocyte injury (Fig. 4.5 ). In the thrombotic stage, mural thrombi stratify on the endocardium. Endocardial thrombophilia is likely promoted by the release of antifibrinolytic mediators such as PAI-2 and thrombomodulin-eosinophilic proteins that impair the anticoagulant property of the endocardial cells [209] . Thrombi most commonly involve the ventricular apex and further extend to subvalvular regions and, occasionally, to atria.

EGPA belongs to the group of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) and is characterized by blood and tissue eosinophilia and asthma, thus distinct from granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and microscopic polyangiitis. ANCA positivity ranges from 30 to 70% in EGPA patients but is usually less frequently observed than in other AAV. Diagnostic and management algorithms for EGPA are reported in the corresponding chapter of this book. Although repeatedly mentioned in review articles, the contribution of germline mutations to EGPA remains elusive. A few reports describe familial clustering of EGPA: a sib pair, brother and sister [220] , two sisters [221] , and father and son [222] . The precise cause is unknown and genetic determinants or contributors remain unexplored. However, exceptional cases of organ transplantation in identical twins and different reactions to the same medication seem to exclude a genetic basis or predisposition to EGPA. One is a pair of twins in which one affected by EGPA received the identical twin graft with rejection-free excellent clinical results [223] . The second example is a pair of twins, both affected by asthma and treated with the same drug (leukotriene receptor antagonists, by instance, suspected to cause EGPA): one twin developed EGPA and the other did not [224] . Nevertheless, the search for risk factors or susceptibility continues to be an object of interest. Genetic studies that investigate the group of AAV [granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS)] showed that the genetic variants may vary in the three groups of AAV.

[276] . AGSs (types 1-7) are auto-inflammatory diseases caused by mutations of genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism/signaling (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR, or IFIH1) and can manifest with in utero disease onset or with postnatal presentation, usually within the first year of life, with subacute encephalopathy (Table 4 .10) [277] . The pathology of affected hearts is still largely unexplored. Cardiac involvement has been described as infantile-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with hypothyroidism and demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Whether the pathologic substrate of the cardiomyopathy has inflammatory origin is still unknown [278] . The absence of Trex1 (TREX1 is one of the known disease genes causing AGS) in mice causes myocarditis [278] . The enzyme degrades endogenous retro-elements, thus linking them to autoimmune disease. In the Trex1-null mouse, an FDA-approved drug that inhibits reverse transcriptase can improve the myocarditis, indicating that retroelements (RE) play a role in this hereditary form of autoimmunity and that administration of RE inhibitors might ameliorate AGS [279] . The possible association of mutations in other genes associated with AGS and myocarditis is still unexplored. However, mutations in IFIH1 cause Singleton-Merten syndrome 1 (SMS1), which is allelic at the same locus of AGS7 and may manifest with cardiomegaly, heart failure, and conduction disease. The syndrome (aortic calcification, dental anomalies, osteopenia and acro-osteolysis, glaucoma, psoriasis, muscle weakness, joint laxity and abnormal facies traits with broad forehead, high anterior hairline, smooth philtrum, and thin upper vermilion border) is unlikely to escape clinical detection [280] . In addition, very recent experimental studies explored the involvement of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) (AGS6) in inflammatory diseases, cancer, and host defenses against viral infections. ADARs are enzymes that regulate RNA metabolism through post-transcriptional mechanisms. In particular, the complex ADAR1p150/DICER promotes the expression of miRNA-222 that is highly expressed in cardiac myocytes in viral myocarditis. In cultured cells, miR-222 suppresses PTEN expression. These preliminary experimental studies suggest that ADAR1p150 could play a role in gene expression in viral myocarditis [281] .

Individual gene variants are candidates to play a role in both disease susceptibility/ predisposition and contribute to the severity of phenotypes and outcomes observed in different patients with myocardial infections caused by the same pathogens. Non-infectious myocarditis, excluding exogenous toxic exposures, may have a hereditary basis or be strongly influenced by genetic factors. It is clinically difficult to distinguish acquired and inherited forms, further because the hereditary forms are often passed as recessive traits. Finally, inherited diseases in immunodeficiency syndromes and auto-inflammatory diseases can have overlapping causes and phenotypes in which myocarditis may occur. These are often syndromic disorders. Many of them have been identified only recently, and the number of reported and proven cases is limited to a few case reports or small clinical series. This clinical area is also continuously expanding, and in the short term, we expect radical changes in our knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms and causes of myocarditis. A critical point remains unsolved: true myocarditis is that diagnosed on tissue biopsy, at least until molecular imaging techniques are readily and routinely available, to demonstrate not the myocardial edema, but the inflammatory interstitial cells. Until then, we can accept a scientific literature that is based on non-biopsy diagnoses, but we retain the belief that, in the absence of pathological evidence, not all diagnoses are correct.
