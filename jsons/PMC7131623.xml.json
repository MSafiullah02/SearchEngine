This is quite frequent as, even after extensive and standardized etiological investigations, the causative agent is documented in only 38\u201352% of cases [1], [2]. Metabolic or toxic encephalopathy diagnosis must be reconsidered when the CSF analysis is normal. The aim of this literature review is to better characterize clinical presentations of infectious encephalitis and understand etiological test performances to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients. We will assume that an amoxicillin and acyclovir treatment was prescribed at the start of patient management.",

It is, however, important to keep in mind that PCR results may be negative during the first few days. The authors of a retrospective study of 38 children presenting with HSV encephalitis reported negative results in 8/33 (24%) children before Day 3 of disease evolution. Diagnostic sensitivity was 74% and 79% at Day 0 and Day 3, respectively. These negative results were significantly associated with a lower CSF protein level and with the absence of associated meningitis (with a cut-off value at 10 leukocytes/mm3 in this study) [15]. The authors of another study of 11 patients presenting with < 3-day history of HSV encephalitis observed that three patients (27%) had an initially negative CSF HSV PCR that turned positive 4 to 7 days later, even after initiating the acyclovir treatment [16]. Negative PCR was not just observed in patients presenting without associated meningitis as the authors of this study reported that the CSF cell count of the three negative CSF PCR tests performed during the first lumbar punctures was 90, 330, and 720 leukocytes/mm3, respectively. Other studies reported negative PCR tests performed on early CSF samples collected after onset of clinical signs [17], [18], [19]. It should, however, be noted that this is rare. The authors of a French prospective study of 253 encephalitis patients observed that 55/55 of patients presenting with HSV encephalitis had an initially positive CSF HSV PCR, even though performed within two days of clinical sign onset for 27/55 patients [2].",

The authors of a literature review of 20 patients presenting with encephalitis but without any associated vasculitis observed that 16 patients (80%) were diagnosed using VZV PCR; the four remaining patients presented or previously presented with vesicular rash [32]. Another study reported a positive CSF VZV PCR in only two of three encephalitis patients (66%) and in 12 of 27 (44%) patients presenting with meningoradiculitis and shingles [27]. However, the authors of a literature review of VZV central nervous system vasculitis observed that VZV PCR was less sensitive than intrathecal secretion of anti-VZV antibody test (P\n < 0.001), as the PCR test was positive for only 9 of 28 patients (30%) who all tested positive for intrathecal secretion [25].

It should be noted that studies reporting the clear superiority of the detection sensitivity of anti-VZV antibodies versus VZV PCR were performed by the same team (Nagel and Gilden, Colorado). Although American guidelines recommend anti-VZV antibody detection test [34], there is no consensus method to perform this analysis. Interpretations are not standardized.

This algorithm has since been prospectively evaluated in 205 patients presenting with meningitis and a low CSF glucose level. It was associated with an excellent negative predictive value (99%), thus allowing to reasonably rule out the diagnosis with a score > 4. It should be noted that a CSF with > 900 NC/mm3 and > 75% of neutrophils is already associated with a score of 3 and 4, respectively [46]. The algorithm has been validated in South-East Asia [47], where the prevalence of tuberculous meningitis is high. It should now be evaluated in countries with a lower prevalence.

When an empirical antituberculosis treatment has been initiated and when cultures remain negative, British guidelines recommend continuing the antituberculosis treatment in the absence of any other etiologies (grade BIII). Guidelines specify that the decision to continue or discontinue the trial of treatment should not be based on the improvement of the patient's condition (or lack of it) on antituberculosis drugs (grade BIII) [44]. Data on CSF evolution during antituberculosis treatment is scarce, but the quantity of lymphocytes and CSF protein level seem to take much longer to normalize than CSF glucose level [53].",

Patients presenting with neurological symptoms at the primary infection stage seemed to contract AIDS more rapidly [84].

The authors of a prospective study of 1988 patients addressed to the California Encephalitis Project for encephalitis without any etiological diagnosis observed signs of recent M. pneumoniae infection (serum IgM, seroconversion, or CSF or respiratory secretion PCR positive for M. pneumoniae) in 111 patients, of whom 84 were children (76%). Diagnosis only relied on serological tests for 80% of these 84 pediatric case patients (serum IgM or seroconversion). Among all adult and pediatric patients, M. pneumoniae PCR in CSF and respiratory secretions was positive in 29% and 2% of cases, respectively [102]. In a large review of Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis, CSF abnormalities were reported in 40 to 60% of patients, usually with 10\u2013200 NC/mm3 and lymphocytic predominance in 90% of cases. A high CSF protein level was observed in 35 to 50% of cases, and CSF glucose level was normal [72]. The limitations of current diagnostic tests are persistently positive serum IgMs and respiratory PCR test several months after initial infection, thus calling into question the responsibility of M. pneumoniae in cases where documentation only relies on one of these tests (as compared with seroconversion or with CSF antibody detection) [103].",

Detecting influenza A or B-specific RNA fragments in CSF samples or brain biopsy plates by RT-PCR has been documented in encephalitis cases as early as 1 or 2 days following infection onset [106]. However, although some studies reported positive influenza CSF PCR tests with five positive cases out of six patients presenting with encephalopathy and influenza A [107], the virus was rarely detected in CSF samples in most other studies [104], [106], [108]. The virus was not detected by cultures or immunostaining technique in the reported autopsy cases, but a diffuse edema without any inflammatory infiltrate nor specific cytopathogenic effect was observed [109].",

This may lead to wrongly interpret the presence of HHV-6 DNA in CSF [130]. In cases of chromosomal integration, parts of the viral genome are massively replicated when the usual host's DNA replication occurs, without triggering infectious virus production and without any associated symptoms. Another diagnostic means of chromosomal integration consists in looking for HHV-6 genome in tissues devoid of living cells such as the hair (not hair follicles) or nails. True HHV-6 encephalitis mainly occurs in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (AHSC) transplantation [131]. For these patients, detected viral loads are far lower than those of patients in whom chromosomal integration is detected. CSF cytological analysis may be normal [132]. The main subtype of HHV-6 associated with encephalitis is HHV-6B, with predominantly limbic presentations [133]. The presence of HHV-6A in the CSF of immunocompetent patients is therefore rather indicative of chromosomal integration than true infection [131]. True encephalitis treatment is ganciclovir or foscavir [128]. Chromosomal integration should not be treated.",

Their authors reported that the CSF analysis usually revealed normal cytology with rare cases of highly moderate pleocytosis, minor elevation of CSF protein level (< 1 g/L), and normal CFS glucose level [134], [135]. JC CSF PCR tests have varying degrees of sensitivity depending on the techniques used (types of primers, prior centrifugation of CSF). The authors of a study of 44 non-HIV-infected patients presenting with histologically confirmed PML observed that the CSF PCR was positive in 19/44 patients (43%) [136]. When the CSF PCR is negative, diagnostic confirmation relies on genome detection by brain biopsy and on histological examination to identify oligodendrocyte destruction with nuclear inclusions of JC virus (electron microscopy) and multifocal loss of myelin. The plasma PCR test may be positive for JC virus [134]. Diagnostic confirmation requires a histological examination to be performed to look for the typical lesion of PML. These features have been observed in 20/24 of patients, including 8 deceased patients [135]. There is no effective specific treatment and only the substantial decrease in immunosuppressant drug dose may impact the functional and vital prognosis [137].",

No underlying immunodeficiency was identified in nine patients (17%) [138]. Central nervous system cryptococcosis cases have been reported by other authors in immunocompetent patients [139]. Signs and symptoms were non-specific in non-HIV-infected patients with fever observed in 29/53 of patients (55%), consciousness disorders or signs of focalization in 20/53 (38%), and meningitis in 20/53 (38%). The authors observed that the CSF cell count of non-HIV-infected patients presenting with CNS cryptococcosis was higher (P\n < 0.05) with a median of 82 [16\u2013160] NC/mm3, a moderately elevated CSF protein level at 0.9 [0.7\u20131.2] g/L, a frequently low CSF glucose level with a mean CSF/blood ratio of 0.35 \u00b1 0.24 [138]. Diagnosis relied on a positive microscopic examination after CSF staining with India ink or on the detection of cryptococcal antigens by CSF analysis or culture, with 100% sensitivity for both techniques. The serum antigen test was positive in 25/29 of cases (86%); thus indicating the dissemination of the fungal infection [138].",

CSF is often hematic, with > 50 RBC/mm3 in 25% of cases [154], [155], [156]. Diagnosis relies on anti-WNV antibody detection (IgG and IgM) in CSF or blood samples. Detecting positive IgM in CSF samples is pathognomonic of a CNS infection as these antibodies do not cross the blood-brain barrier. IgM sensitivity in CSF is good, reported at 94% (89% if sampled < 8 days) [156], while it usually is negative in blood the first 15 days after symptom onset [157]. Antibodies remain in the CSF for a long time after the end of the infection, for more than two months in 50% of patients [155], [158] and may even stay longer as specific IgM were detected in the CSF samples of three patients 110, 141, and 199 days following WNV encephalitis [159]. Viral genome detection by PCR may also be performed, but its sensitivity is lower: 57% in CSF and 14% in plasma [156]. Combining plasma PCR and serological tests helps improve diagnostic sensitivity at the acute phase of the infection, as showed in a study where plasma PCR alone had a 45% sensitivity, IgM serology alone had a 58% sensitivity, and both of these techniques combined had a 94% sensitivity [160].",

No patient presented with low CSF glucose level. Baseline and discharge serum serology led to establishing diagnosis in 14 and 15 patients, respectively.

Serology helped in establishing diagnosis, but it had limitations as results could be negative in immunocompromised patients, with cases confirmed by brain biopsy while the serology was negative [185]. Besides, in exposed patients, serology could be positive even though no sign of amoebic encephalitis was observed. The serology cut-off value was 1:64 [185]. The diagnosis is usually hard to establish and must lead to stereotactic brain biopsy with microscopic examination by hematoxylin and eosin staining in case of a positive serological test to look for cysts and trophozoite forms. Diagnostic confirmation may be done by PCR or culture [186]. When a CSF 16S RNA PCR test and a brain biopsy PCR were combined to diagnose free-living amoeba encephalitis, the sensitivity was excellent (5/5 cases with a positive PCR test on at least one of the two samples) [187]. The typical brain lesion observed in Balamuthia or Acanthamoeba amoebic encephalitis patients was a granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, although the absence of granuloma at histological examination did not rule out the diagnosis [188]. Amoeba usually looks like a ring and are located in the perivascular space of brain vessels [185].",
