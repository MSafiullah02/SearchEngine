            "text": "The demon shrimp, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes (Eichwald 1841), is a non-native freshwater amphipod in the UK that exerts low levels of ecological damage and inter-species competition (Bovy et al., 2015). The species hosts multiple mortality-inducing and behaviour-altering pathogens that have been carried alongside the invasion into the UK (Bojko et al., 2018a). Infection with the microsporidian pathogen Cucumispora ornata Bojko, Dunn, Stebbing, Ross, Kerr, Stentiford 2015 was noted to reduce activity in heavily infected hosts and was associated with mortality in both D. haemobaphes and non-target Gammarus pulex (L.), which also have the infection in wild populations (Bojko et al., 2018a). \u2018Dikerogammarus haemobaphes bi-facies-like Virus\u2019 (DhbflV), was also identified as a mortality-inducing virus at low prevalence within the D. haemobaphes population in the UK (Bojko et al., 2018a). Finally, a likely novel member of the Nudiviridae, \u2018Dikerogammarus haemobaphes Bacilliform Virus\u2019 (DhBV) was found to increase the activity of its host and potentially alter the rate of invasion spread (Bojko et al., 2018a).",

Next generation sequencing platforms and bioinformatic tools provide the ability to rapidly provide data on the genomic composition of the demon shrimp and aid the development of diagnostic tools. Recent advances in the sequencing of mitochondrial genomes from amphipods has also allowed for increased phylogenetic information, with an excess of 50 mitochondrial genomes being available for Amphipoda (Romanova et al., 2016; Macher et al., 2017; Cormier et al., 2018).",

Other Amphipoda show predicted branching throughout the tree, with all genera represented by multiple species (Eulimnogammarus, Gammarus, Platorchestia, Hyallela, Epimeria, Pseudoniphargus, Stygobromus, Metacrangonyx and Caprella) branching together (Fig. 4). The tree shows low bootstrap support close to the root (55 or 38), suggesting that further sequencing of highly derived amphipods may help to add detail to the tree and its topology, providing further detail to the tree and increase its accuracy at predicting topology.",

Bacilliform viruses (Nudiviridae), intracellular bacteria (\u2018Candidatus Aquirickettsiella\u2019), species from two genera of Microsporidia (Cucumispora and Dictyocoela) and the presence of gregarines (Apicomplexa) are presented on the tree alongside known hosts (Fig. 5). Bacilliform viruses are present in two Gammarus sp. and D. haemobaphes, which sit at the base of the Gammaridae in Fig. 4. These same individuals also host intracellular bacteria (Candidatus Aquirickettsiella). Systematically identified Cucumispora sp. are restricted to two host species with mitochondrial genome data, D. haemobaphes and Gammarus roeselii (L.); however, multiple SSU sequences from Ponto-Caspian amphipod hosts place Cucumispora candidates across Fig. 5. Gregarines have been observed in D. haemobaphes, all Gammarus sp. and in members of the Eulimnogammarus genus (Fig. 5).",

The data presented herein have identified that the D. haemobaphes population seeding the UK invasion was likely originating in central Europe and not the native range, which means that the diseases identified from extensive screening in the UK are likely also present in the European range (Bojko et al., 2015, 2018b). Many of these diseases can impact the activity of their host, but also cause mortality in non-target amphipod hosts, such as G. pulex, potentially threatening biodiversity (Bojko et al., 2018b).",

Combining data from any disease screening efforts with the phylogenetics conducted herein indicated that Microsporidia [Cucumispora sp. (including candidatus species) and Dictyocoela sp.] are present across the Gammaridae, with the exception of P. kessleri and C. tuberculatus, likely due to a lack of screening effort. Gregarine parasites (Apicomplexa) are present in Eulimnogammarus sp., Gammarus sp. and D. haemobaphes, suggesting that this group is also likely present across the Gammaridae. The recent discovery of \u2018Candidatus Aquirickettsiella gammari\u2019Bojko, Dunn, Stebbing, van Aerle, Bacela-Spychalska, Bean, Urrutia, Stentiford 2018b and similar pathologies in D. haemobaphes (Bojko, 2017) and G. roeselii (Bojko et al., 2017) suggest that increased screening will also discover related pathogens across the Gammaridae. Finally, bacilliform viruses in the hepatopancreas of crustaceans (now thought to be part of the Nudiviridae) have been found in multiple Gammaridae, including: Dikerogammarus sp. (Bojko et al., 2013; 2018b) and Gammarus sp. (Bojko et al., 2017). The presence of this virus in this early branching gammarid host suggests the viral group are also likely present in the other Gammaridae (Fig. 5).",
