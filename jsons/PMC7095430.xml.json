Shortly thereafter, several genetically related viruses were identified in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus)3\u20137. At the same time, improvements in next-generation sequencing technology led to a boom of virus discovery, uncovering thousands of virus sequences in wild animal populations around the world. While most of these viruses have never been found in humans, many are genetically similar to known human viruses within the betacoronavirus genus. The betacoronaviruses are further divided into four lineages (that is, A\u2013D). Lineage B, which includes SARS-CoV and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2, has approximately 200 published virus sequences, whereas lineage C, which includes Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has over 500 viral sequences.",

Additionally, a previous study showed that replacing the RBD of the lineage B bat virus Rp3 allowed the virus to enter cells expressing human ACE216. We therefore developed a method to functionally test the RBDs from lineage B betacoronaviruses in place of the SARS-CoV spike RBD (Fig. 1). Synthesizing just the RBD of spike is much faster and cost effective than conventional pseudotyping methods that rely on the synthesis of the full spike sequence (~4 kilobases (kb)) for CoVs\u2014a process that can take weeks and is cost prohibitive for large panels of spike sequences. The short turnaround time for our approach allowed us to test the receptor usage of all published, unique RBD sequences in lineage B, and to rapidly confirm the ACE2 receptor usage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, which emerged in China in January 2020 as our study was ongoing.",

We introduced silent mutations in the codon-optimized coding sequence for SARS-CoV to facilitate replacing the SARS RBD with the RBD from other lineage B viruses (Fig. 1b). All lineage B sequences were downloaded from online repositories and parsed to 29 unique RBD sequences, representing all published variations of the lineage B RBD (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). These 29 RBDs phylogenetically cluster into three clades, as previously described5, but these RBD clades were not apparent in phylogenetic analysis of other viral sequences, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Extended Data Fig. 1c). All 29 RBDs were codon optimized, synthesized and cloned in place of the SARS RBD, generating chimeric spike expression constructs. We then produced vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) reporter particles pseudotyped with the chimeric spikes (Fig. 1c)17. We chose VSV over lentiviruses as our pseudotype platform because lentiviral pseudotypes have failed to accurately reflect viral entry with bat coronavirus spike protein7. All constructs exhibited similar levels of expression in producer cells and incorporation into VSV pseudotypes, except the chimera with BM48-31, which displayed somewhat reduced expression compared with the wild-type SARS spike (Fig. 1d). We then infected baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing the receptor for SARS-CoV or empty vector (Fig. 1e) and observed that only clade 1, which includes SARS-CoV, could enter cells transfected with human ACE2 (Fig. 1e).",

To circumvent host-cell protease incompatibility or absence, we protease treated our pseudotype panel and infected a wide variety of cell types from different host species (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). In the absence of exogenous protease, only clade 1 infected cells from African green monkey kidney, human gastrointestinal tract, human liver and porcine kidney, in agreement with previous studies. Surprisingly, exogenous protease enhanced entry of a subset of clade 2 spike chimeras in nonhuman primate, bat and human cells (Fig. 2).

Only clade 1 RBDs contain all 14 residues that have been shown through crystallography to interact with human ACE2 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 4). The majority of these residues are absent from clades 2 and 3, which contain additional deletions in surface-exposed loops that cluster at the interface with ACE2 (Fig. 4a,b). We generated a series of clade consensus RBD variants to determine the minimum number of mutations needed to impart ACE2 function on clade 2 and 3 RBDs (Fig. 4c). Introducing the two loop deletions from clade 1 in clade 2 resulted in reduced spike expression, impaired pseudotype incorporation and loss of cell entry (Fig. 4c,d). Restoring these loops in clades 2 and 3 from the loops found in clade 1 did not enhance entry with ACE2 (Fig. 4c; 2 \u2192 1 and 3 \u2192 1 (version 1)). Introducing all 14 ACE2 contact points in clade 2 or 3 also failed to restore ACE2 entry (Fig. 4c; 2 \u2192 1 and 3 \u2192 1 (version 2)). Only replacing all 14 contact points and the surrounding amino acids (known as the receptor-binding motif (RBM)) led to increased ACE2 entry with clade 2 and 3 RBDs (Fig. 4c; 2 \u2192 1 (version 3) = clade 2 residues 322\u2013400 + clade 1 residues 400\u2013501; 3 \u2192 1 (version 3) = clade 3 residues 322\u2013385 + clade 1 residues 386\u2013501).",

All chimeric constructs expressed similarly, with the exception of the SARS\u2013BM48-31 RBD chimera, which exhibited reduced expression and incorporation (Figs. 1d and 5b). Protease treatment enhanced entry of both the As6526 clade 2 RBD chimera and full-length spike into Huh cells (Fig. 5c).

Because most of these viruses have never been isolated, we resorted to synthetic biology and molecular engineering to reduce the burden of gene synthesis to just a small fragment. Thus, the cost and synthesis production time for testing several spikes for entry in our system is dramatically reduced (Extended Data Fig. 1d).

While the RBD\u2013receptor interaction is the most studied in this process, recent studies have highlighted the major role host protease processing plays as a species barrier19,22\u201324. Lineage C coronaviruses include MERS-CoV as well as distantly related viruses such as HKU4, HKU5 and PDF-2180 (refs. 25,26). Studies have shown that HKU4 can bind human DPP4 but requires the addition of exogenous trypsin to facilitate cell entry, and that HKU5 and PDF-2180 spikes can enter human cells through an unidentified receptor with protease treatment19,23. Analogous to these lineage C CoV studies, we observed protease-enhanced entry of lineage B CoVs (Figs. 2, 3 and 5). While it has been shown that host proteases cleave spike, allowing for downstream membrane fusion, other evidence suggests that protease may act on the receptor as well to activate it27. The addition of protease during the course of SARS-CoV infection facilitated entry in cells with low expression of ACE2 (normally insufficient to support virus entry)27. Indeed, we saw evidence of residual trypsin activity on the cells after infection in our studies, as the cell monolayer was loose compared with the untreated condition. Similarly, Menachery et al.23 also observed cell rounding during their trypsin infections. Therefore, further studies are needed to assess where trypsin is enhancing entry of coronaviruses: at the level of spike, the receptor, or both.",

The other spikes from clade 2 and 3 did not enter the cells we tested, regardless of protease addition, suggesting an absent or incompatible receptor. Surprisingly, the protease-dependent entry phenotype was consistent in the reverse spike chimeras in which we replaced the RBD in clade 2 or 3 spike with a clade 1 RBD (Fig. 5d), suggesting that either the protease site between S1 and S2 is not compatible with the chimeric spike backbone or the protease is not expressed in these cells (Extended Data Fig. 5). Because clade 1 spikes enter cells expressing human ACE2 without the addition of protease, but clade 2\u2013clade 1 chimeras require protease, our data show that the spike protease cleavage site may be adapted to the protease environment of the receptor-bound RBD (Extended Data Fig. 5).",

Unfortunately, a common problem with studies assessing viral entry in cell types from different species is accurately measuring surface protein expression of the receptor through conventional methods such as flow cytometry. We have previously shown that DPP4 from different species cross-reacts differently with the same DPP4 antibody, confounding correlations between receptor expression level and entry31.",

We did not observe any pseudotype entry in the presence of protease and the absence of receptor, suggesting that lineage B cell entry is still receptor dependent following protease treatment (Fig. 3b). While our study was ongoing, a lineage B betacoronavirus was identified as the etiological agent behind an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China (SARS-CoV-2). The RBD for SARS-CoV-2 has residues and motifs found in all three clades but forms a distinct clade, so we tested it for receptor usage and observed entry of human ACE2 but not other known coronavirus receptors (Fig. 3d). Interestingly, within the backbone of SARS-CoV spike, cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to the other clade 1 spikes tested, including SARS-CoV. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of using human ACE2 as efficiently, if not more, as SARS-CoV, which may help to explain the human-to-human transmissibility of this virus. Our finding that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 has now been confirmed with the full virus and a computer modelling-based approach32,33.",

Simply mutating clades 2 and 3 to have these 14 contact points was insufficient to impart human ACE2 usage, and in some instances even led to protein destabilization and a loss of pseudotype incorporation of spike (Fig. 4c). This is probably because the non-contact residues in the RBM play a critical structural role for these contact points, and indeed, these non-contact residues are different between the clades (Extended Data Fig. 4).",
