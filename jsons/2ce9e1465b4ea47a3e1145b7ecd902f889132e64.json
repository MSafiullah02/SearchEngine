Because GSK983 is an ineffective antiviral in the presence of physiological uridine concentrations, we explored combining GSK983 with pyrimidine salvage inhibitors. We synthesized and evaluated analogs of cyclopentenyl uracil (CPU), an inhibitor of uridine salvage. We found that CPU was converted into its triphosphate in cells. When combined with GSK983, CPU resulted in large drops in cellular UTP and CTP pools. Consequently, CPU-GSK983 suppressed dengue virus replication in the presence of physiological concentrations of uridine. In addition, the CPU-GSK983 combination markedly enhanced the effect of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibition on viral infection. Our findings highlight a new host-targeting strategy for potentiating the antiviral activity of RdRp inhibitors.",

More recently, the broad-spectrum RdRp inhibitor prodrug remdesivir (Gordon et al., 2020) has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 . Meanwhile, targeting host proteins required for viral propagation is emerging as an attractive alternative that may circumvent the emergence of resistance (Bekerman and Einav, 2015) . For example, maraviroc inhibits the human chemokine receptor CCR5, and is therefore used to treat multidrug-resistant HIV (Lieberman-Blum et al., 2008) . More recently, pyrimidine biosynthesis has emerged as a potential host-targeting strategy for antivirals (Okesli et al., 2017) . Here, we focus on devising a host-targeting antiviral approach for the treatment of RNA viruses, which cause many serious diseases such as viral hepatitis, influenza, Ebola, dengue, and COVID-19.",

            "text": "In mammalian cells, pyrimidine biosynthesis is a tightly regulated metabolic process. Two complementary pathways-de novo biosynthesis and pyrimidine salvage-are responsible for producing UTP and CTP for host as well as viral RNA synthesis ( Figure 1 ). De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is a resource-intensive process. In contrast, salvage occurs via phosphorylation of UMP and CMP derived from intracellular RNA degradation or via facilitated transport and phosphorylation of extracellular uridine, whose plasma concentration is tightly controlled in the low micromolar range (Traut, 1994) . Recently, we discovered that GSK983, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent first reported in 2009 (Harvey et al., 2009 , is a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a rate-limiting step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis . In the course of those unbiased genome-wide studies, we also found that knockdown of uridine/cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) and uridine monophosphate/ cytidine monophosphate kinase 1 (CMPK1) in the pyrimidine salvage pathway strongly sensitized cells to growth inhibition by GSK983 . This finding was consistent with the observation that most DHODH inhibitors lack antiviral efficacy in vivo despite high potency in vitro presumably due to salvage metabolism of circulating uridine by virus-infected cells (Bonavia et al., 2011; Cheung et al., 2017; Grandin et al., 2016; Smee et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011; Xiong et al., 2020) .",

Inclusion of CPU or 5-F-CPU led to large decreases in UTP and CTP levels compared with cells treated with GSK983 alone; these effects grew more pronounced at 12 h ( Figure S4 ). CPU depleted UTP and CTP concentrations more strongly than 5-F-CPU.

Such replicon systems include the coding region needed for viral RNA translation and replication, while lacking the structural genes necessary for the production of viral particles. Consequently, viral genome replication is examined independently of viral entry and particle assembly (Kato and Hishiki, 2016) . In this assay (Figure 7) , the EC 50 of R1479 alone was $90 mM. Inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis alone with GSK983 did not alter this value ($96 mM), whereas addition of 250 mM CPU shifted it to $56 mM. Targeting both the de novo and salvage pathways with a combination of 1 mM GSK and 250 mM CPU lowered the EC 50 of R1479 by over 4-fold to $19 mM.

In particular, dengue causes hundreds of millions of symptomatic infections annually yet lacks any antiviral treatment, while the sole approved vaccine has limited use because of safety risks associated with vaccination of individuals not previously exposed to dengue (Lim et al., 2013; Sridhar et al., 2018) . A series of high-throughput phenotypic cell-based screens have recently identified DHODH inhibition as a potent, broad-spectrum antiviral strategy in vitro (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Lucas-Hourani et al., 2013; Luthra et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2011) . Furthermore, a DHODH inhibitor was recently shown to suppress SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Xiong et al., 2020).

Intracellular nucleotide depletion appears correlated with antiviral activity given that the structurally unrelated nucleoside transport inhibitor DPY also suppressed intracellular nucleotide levels and viral replication ( Figure S5 ). In addition, while 250 mM CPU in the absence of GSK983 did slightly potentiate the effects of R1479 on viral replication (Figure 7) , this did not translate to decreased viral infection at the same time point ( Figure S6A ). Nevertheless, further investigation of inhibitory effects of CPU-TP on dengue RdRp is warranted. Indeed, as noted previously, NIs are the largest class of RdRp inhibitors (Klumpp et al., 2008). A multi-factorial approach that incorporates information about ll Article interactions with multiple host and viral enzymes will likely be useful for future SAR around CPU as this compound remained the most efficacious in our panel. In addition, efforts to develop specific inhibitors of UCK2 are needed. We previously identified such inhibitors through a high-throughput screen (Okesli-Armlovich et al., 2019); however, these inhibitors appeared to lack sufficient potency to synergize with GSK983 in antiviral models (data not shown).",

While the safety profile of GSK983 remains less clear, other DHODH inhibitors such as US Food and Drug Administration-approved arthritis drugs leflunomide and teriflunomide and the clinical-stage anti-cancer compound brequinar have been extensively studied in humans and are generally tolerated (Aly et al., 2017) . We note that the potential immunosuppressive effects of DHODH inhibitors may be viewed as helpful (Xiong et al., 2020) or harmful (Bonavia et al., 2011) in the treatment of viral infection. Meanwhile, many RdRp inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials against dengue. While a preliminary study combining CPU with a de novo synthesis inhibitor in vivo resulted in toxicity (Cysyk et al., 1995) , there is precedent for combining inhibitors of de novo pyrimidine synthesis with nucleoside transport inhibitors in humans (Casper et al., 1991) . With careful dose optimization and an eye toward immune effects, our results suggest that a combination strategy targeting both host pyrimidine biosynthesis and viral RdRp holds promise as a potential therapy against RNA viruses.",

Reaction mixtures were stirred using Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bars and monitored by thin layer silica gel chromatography (TLC) using 0.25 mm silica gel 60F plates with fluorescent indicator from Merck. Plates were visualized under UV or treated by KMnO 4 stain with gentle heating. Products were purified on an AnaLogix IntelliFlash 280 Flash column chromatography system using the solvent gradients indicated. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2 ), dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, and Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Acros Organics. Diethyl ether (Et 2 O), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), hexanes, and methanol (MeOH) were from Fisher Scientific. DMSO used in bioassays and to prepare biological samples was from Fisher BioReagents. All other reagents were from commercial suppliers and were used as received without additional purification. Samples prepared for biological evaluation were purified via preparative HPLC in a water/acetonitrile (MeCN) gradient containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) using an Agilent 1260 Infinity system equipped with an Agilent Prep-C18 column (21.2 x 250 mm).

The reaction mixture was then warmed up to room temperature and stirred for another hour. A saturated solution of NH 4 Cl (2 mL) was added. The organic layer was extracted with 3 3 3 mL CH 2 Cl 2 , washed with H 2 O, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified through a 4g SiO 2 flash cartridge with a linear gradient 65-95% EtOAc in hexanes to afford the intermediate 10 (56 mg, 0.13 mmol, 82%) as colorless oil.",
