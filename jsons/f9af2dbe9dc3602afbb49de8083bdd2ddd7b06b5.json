Therefore, their possible role against viraemia remains unknown.

IFN and TNF occur in response to infections, in\u00afammation and cancer [16\u00b119]. The others are constitutive, i.e. UTIb and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and their antiviral activities are presented in Table 1 [3, 4, 20] . The antiviral activity was determined by a plaque reduction assay as described previously [21] . The assay was done in duplicate, using the continuous presence of 2-fold serial dilutions of the test substance in 96-well microtitre plates with con-\u00afu ent cell monolayer and challenged with 40 PFU of virus (MOI=0.03). One unit (U) of antiviral activity was de\u00aened as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the inhibitor showing 50% reduction of plaques compared with the virus control. A reference virus inhibitor standard was used in each assay as a positive control. The viruses used in these studies were originally from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, except Coxsackie virus B3, which was obtained from Dr Charles J. Gaunt, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX. Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cell, American Type Culture Collection, CCL81) were used for assaying the viruses except for vaccinia. For this virus CERs (chicken embryo reticulocytes) received from the laboratory of Dr Robert Shope, Yale University, CT at that time, were used [3, 4] . A broad antiviral activity may be an important feature of an antiviral defence. Table 1 shows that UTIb and HDL inhibited all of the viruses tested, which included DNA and enveloped and nonenveloped RNA viruses. However, UTIb was not active against HIV (unpublished \u00aendings). The inhibitory activity of UTIb was usually greater than HDL against the same virus, so UTIb appears to account for most of the antiviral activity of human serum. The two preparations of HDL were comparable except that the preparation from Dr G. M. Ananthramiah, Department of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and The Arthrosclerosis Research Unit, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294-0012, USA, was inactive against poliovirus.

The reversibility of inhibition of viral infectivity was determined by mixing the inhibitor preparation with the virus suspension and then incubating the mixture at 37uC for 2 h.

The cultures were then washed three times with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and overlaid with 0.5% methylcellulose in Hepes buffer (MC) [24] . Plaques were stained with crystal violet and read on day 2. The rationale for this experiment is that at 4uC the cell membrane is physiologically inert, and hence virus replication should not proceed beyond initial attachment to the target cell. Equal antiviral activity (titres) at 4uC and 37uC imply that the antiviral substance is active at 4uC, and, therefore, acts at the stage of virus attachment to target cells. Inhibitors acting at post-attachment stages result in signi\u00aecantly higher titres at 37uC. As shown in Table 2 the titres of UTIb at 4uC and 37uC for all viruses used except HSV-1 were statistically indistinguishable. In the case of HSV-1, an inhibitory titre of 48 U/mL occurred at 37uC compared with 9 U/mL at 4uC, indicating that some of the inhibition of HSV-1 replication is at a step subsequent to adsorption.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 486, "end": 490, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1015, "end": 1022, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Inhibition of attachment"}, {"text": "In comparison, in the case of HDL, Sindbis or mengo virus attachment was not inhibited at 4uC, indicating that HDL inhibited at a post-attachment step in virus replication.

To allow only virus attachment, the cells were precooled to 4uC for 1 h in a 96-well microtitre plate, infected with 40 PFU (MOI=0.03) of Sindbis or mengo virus, and after 1 h in the cold to allow virus to attach to cells, washed twice with cold HBSS to remove unabsorbed virus. The cells were warmed to 37uC to initiate virus penetration for 1 h in the presence of serial two-fold dilutions of inhibitor to allow any inhibitory effect to occur during the time of penetration.

The plaques were counted and the percent inhibition of plaques relative to control was calculated as an indicator of inhibition of virus events at the stage of virus penetration.

This same type of experiment showed that HDL, on the other hand, acts against most viruses at a post-attachment stage.

There is, however, one report of in vivo protective effect of a broadly active, nonspeci\u00aec virus inhibitor found in vertebrate nervous systems. Protection of inhibitor-treated mice was demonstrated against both an alphavirus and a picornavirus (Table 4 ). Based on this protection and other correlations, the authors suggested a natural defensive role for this broadly antiviral inhibitor that is present widely and in high concentration in tissues and extracellular\u00afuid of human nervous system [25] . Similar in vivo protection studies should be done with the serum inhibitors. A possible defensive role of the narrowly active serum inhibitors in natural resistance has been reviewed by Kriznova and Rathova [10] . The mechanisms of action of these inhibitors are competitive inhibition of virus attachment to cells and neutralisation of viral infectivity by a mechanism unlike classical antibody because complement is not needed for their activity. The various approaches undertaken to elucidate the possible role of these serum inhibitors in the natural resistance of the organism was grouped into three categories. In the \u00aerst category an effort was made to \u00aend a correlation between the susceptibility of experimental animals to a particular virus, and the natural inhibitory activity of their sera [1,26\u00b128] .

In several experiments it was shown that mice and hamsters fed ethionine had appreciably reduced virus inhibitory activity in serum against in\u00afuenza A 1 and Newcastle disease viruses than did untreated . These observations point to a relationship in vivo between the level of serum inhibitors and in\u00afuenza virus multiplication and thus support the notion that the narrowly active, nonspeci\u00aec viral inhibitors can be a factor in innate resistance to speci\u00aec viruses. The third category assessed the direct effect of administering the inhibitors at different times during viral infection. Experimental animals were administered an inhibitor preparation at different intervals either before or immediately after virus inoculation. Using gamma serum inhibitor it was shown that the multiplication of the inhibitor-sensitive strain of in\u00afuenza A 2 virus in mice lungs was inhibited. This effect was seen only when the inhibitor was administered before the virus had time to penetrate into susceptible cells. The inhibitor and the virus were administered intranasally [32\u00b136]. Gamma inhibitor given intranasally 4\u00b16 h post-infection or later was not protective while high doses of inhibitor given ip even at longer intervals after infection showed an appreciable protective effect [34] .
