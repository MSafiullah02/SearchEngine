Because of the important implications of such work, it is hardly surprising that claims of important breakthroughs often inspire heated debate \u2013 one famous example was the claim that the Martian meteorite ALH84001 contained fossilized life (McKay et al., 1996). This claim required researchers to critically assess fossil and geochemical evidence with a new level of scrutiny, and it has been suggested that despite the consensus that this claim has been refuted, the academic debate has better prepared scientists to assess future evidence for ET (extraterrestrial) life (Dick and Strick, 2004). While this may be true in a situation where conclusions can be subject to rigorous independent analysis, the field of astrobiology also includes speculative research that is at present difficult, if not impossible, to independently test in the manner of the Martian meteorite (Rinaldi, 2007).",

            "text": "The concept of panspermia can be traced back to a number of different historical origins, from ancient societies that believed in the universality of life to the musings of the early astronomers (Temple, 2007; Crowe, 2008). Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe are commonly associated with the modern incarnation of panspermia, apparently being convinced of the truth of panspermia after the widespread nature of organic compounds in interstellar space was discovered (Hoyle and Wickramasinghe, 1996). Aside from Crick and Orgel\u2019s (Crick and Orgel, 1973) discussions of \u201cdirected panspermia\u201d (intentional seeding by intelligent beings, proposed earlier: \u201cJ.B.S. Haldane\u2026 expressed a belief, in 1954 (Haldane, 1954), that life may have\u2026 been launched into space by intelligent beings\u201d (Bernal, 1962)), few other authors have developed a hypothesis as extensive in detail as Hoyle and Wickramasinghe (Wickramasinghe, 2010). These authors suggest that microbial life is ubiquitous and persistent in the cosmos and serves as a constant source of inoculum and genetic material for new planets, contributing to evolutionary trends on each world. We use the structure of their hypothesis to inform discussion on the following questions about panspermia:\nWhat, if any, evidence is there for life outside Earth?Is it conceivable that life as we know it could be viably transferred through space to other habitats?How likely is it that transferred life would become established and go on to seed neighboring systems, thus amplifying the process?Can panspermia influence evolutionary progress or affect the origin of life debate?\n",

Three of the four experiments designed to test for the presence of life gave negative or ambiguous results (GC/MS, gas exchange, and pyrolytic release experiments), but one final test, the labeled release (LR) experiment, offered a striking positive response. This test, which aimed to detect the respiration of radioactively labeled organic compounds by microorganisms, yielded a strong positive result, with control experiments offering negative responses. The LR experiment was extensively field-tested on Earth and was found to be sensitive to extremely small quantities of viable cells in extreme Earth environments, the closest we have to a Martian analogue. However, after the fact, this evidence was discounted in favor of an inorganic explanation that theorized that UV-produced peroxides in the Martian soil were responsible for the oxidation (Quinn and Zent, 1999), despite the validity of these theories remaining questioned by the inventor of the apparatus, Gilbert Levin (Levin, 1981, 2007).",

            "text": "Levin\u2019s case has been bolstered by a recent investigation that suggested that the GC/MS experiment aboard the Viking would have been insensitive to the organic constituents of Antarctic soils, which are by no means devoid of life (Navarro-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2006). In addition to this, recent evidence of water ice under the Martian surface (Boynton et al., 2002), in its atmosphere (Pearl et al., 2001), as well as the discovery of seasonal methane emissions (Krashnopolsky et al., 2004) has led Levin to opine: \u201cWhat would be truly extraordinary in the light of present knowledge would be finding Mars to be sterile\u201d (Levin, 2007). Despite this evidence, recent information obtained from Martian landers suggests an arid, acidic, and oxidizing early Mars (Squyres and Knoll, 2005), and the recent unexpected discovery of perchlorate salts in the Martian soil (Hecht et al., 2009), gives evidence for the presence of an oxidant that may yet convincingly explain the results of the LR experiments as abiotic. Future robotic missions that are slated for the current decade aim to clarify some of these questions by sampling up to 2 m below the Martian surface and may yet offer generally accepted signs of life on Mars (Rinaldi, 2007). Other authors have described instruments that may overcome the limitations of the Viking GC/MS experiments by detecting PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) with higher sensitivity and distinguishing between enantiomers of amino acids (Bada, 2001), though final confirmation may have to await proposed sample return missions (Schulze-Makuch and Irwin, 2002).",

Several lines of evidence were used to reach this conclusion, including the presence of PAHs, magnetite and sulfide minerals, and carbonate globules that resembled bacteria, though an order of magnitude smaller than any known Earth cell (McKay et al., 1996). The initial enthusiasm for this claim has largely subsided, based on the fact that the biological production of any one of the lines of evidence used by the authors to argue for this is no more compelling than the argument for a \u201cnull\u201d abiotic origin. J. William Schopf addressed some of the limitations of their finding (Dick and Strick, 2004) relating to the \u201cmicrofossils\u201d discovered within the meteorite:\nEven though they showed multiple examples of the microbe-like objects in question, their suggestion failed because the putative fossils lack cell lumina, carbonaceous cell walls, taphonomically credible variable preservation, and plausible biological size ranges.

These microscopic fossils, which were originally characterized tentatively as cyanobacteria existing in a shallow sea bottom, were criticized based on their visual appearance as well as their geological context (Brasier et al., 2002). Brasier et al. claimed that the fossils had morphology inconsistent with cyanobacteria and that they were in fact carbonaceous artifacts produced in a hydrothermal environment. This debate resulted in many follow-up publications by both Brasier and Schopf describing techniques for testing evidence, such as confirmation of three-dimensional morphology (Schopf and Kudryavtsev, 2005), as well as a number of arguments about the placement of these fossils in a more robust geological context (Brasier et al., 2005).",

Publications by Schopf and colleagues offer evidence to support the biogenicity of these fossils through more in-depth examinations of both morphology as well as the organic constituents of the microfossils (Schopf et al., 2005, 2007; Schopf, 2006). This debate is still far from over \u2013 new data suggests the structures are not in fact microfossils, though still indicative of microbial life (Marshall et al., 2011). However, Brasier\u2019s most significant achievement has been the reframing of the world where these ancient organisms existed, as well as their phylogenetic affinities \u2013 no longer do paleontologists believe that these organisms were undoubtedly cyanobacteria existing in a temperate \u201cearly Eden\u201d (Brasier et al., 2004); rather, they appear to have existed in a geologically active hydrothermal environment. This example is a cautionary tale \u2013 if Schopf\u2019s picture of the early Earth as enshrined in textbooks can be so easily challenged, inferences made about life outside of Earth (that we have even less ability to directly study) may be overturned just as quickly. Purported ET (extraterrestrial) microfossils must be similarly examined with extreme caution with every attempt to confirm the null hypothesis, before claims can be made that they represent unambiguous signs of life.",

It may be that infrequent events cause bacteria to be transferred to the stratosphere, with only the UV-resistant cells remaining viable for recovery in these microbiological experiments. Alternatively, it may be that the process of transport to the upper atmosphere and consequent return to the surface is enough to select for organisms resistant to ionizing radiation, similar to the argument of Pavlov et al.

This topic was ably reviewed by Horneck and Brack (1992), who point out several mechanisms for particles to reach space, including volcanic eruptions, flyby meteorites, and direct meteorite impacts. In these cases, both large pieces of rock as well as smaller particles would reach escape velocity. Large particles may travel to another planet by random chance (lithopanspermia), and smaller particles may be accelerated outwards from their parent star by radiation pressure or carried by interstellar particle clouds (radiopanspermia) (Horneck, 1995). Aside from impacts, small particles may also be directly transported to space (Dehel, 2006) or created through subsequent impacts with other objects (Napier, 2004). In this manner, we can imagine a small number of large meteorites and a larger number of smaller particles exiting a planet\u2019s surface, all with the potential to carry resistant forms of life.",

            "text": "A clear barrier to transfer is the sudden shock of temperature and pressure that will occur on both exit and atmospheric reentry. Despite these harsh conditions, simulations indicate that many resistant forms of life such as bacterial endospores can survive (Mastrapa et al., 2001; Stoffler et al., 2007), although there appears to be a critical size below which a meteorite would not be suitable for transfer (Parnell et al., 2008; Foucher et al., 2010) due to heat sterilization at depths of 2\u20135 cm. This implies that any lithopanspermia event will filter out organisms such as phototrophs that do not exist deep within rocks (Cockell, 2008). While bacteria have been found living in the interior of many substrates (Takai et al., 2001; Wainwright et al., 2009), indicating a random impact will eject organisms to space, the small amount of biological material contained within may reduce the probability of a successful transfer (Clark, 2001).",

Known Martian meteorites took from between \u223c6.0  \u00d7  105 and up to \u223c14 million years to arrive on Earth (Eugster et al., 1997), and radiopanspermia has been suggested to take a minimum of 106 years to reach a new planetary system although considerably less within a solar system (Secker et al., 1996). While bacterial life has been claimed to be potentially viable for possibly up to millions of years (Vreeland et al., 2000), this has been criticized on the basis that DNA is not thermodynamically stable enough to remain intact for this long (Graur and Pupko, 2001) and that there is possibility of contamination during sampling procedures that purport to isolate ancient life (Willerslev et al., 2004; Willerslev and Hebsgaard, 2005). Even if contamination is ruled out, the thermodynamic argument remains strong since DNA is inherently unstable \u2013 experiments examining dormant bacteria trapped in Antarctic ice corroborate this line of reasoning (Bidle et al., 2007), showing decreased viability of cells with an increased period of dormancy. In addition, the ability for DNA to remain viable may vary with phylogeny, with calculations suggesting that mesophiles are least likely to retain viable DNA over long periods, while thermophiles have a much better chance (Nicholson, 2003).",

Radiation shielding is plausible with lithopanspermia events, but the small particle sizes necessary for radiopanspermia decrease radiation shielding greatly, although it has been suggested that a thin film of carbon may be sufficient to shelter organisms from inactivating UV radiation (Wickramasinghe et al., 2009).",

There does appear to be some evidence that comets and potentially asteroids contained liquid water early in their history from the decay of radioactive aluminum (Wilson et al., 1999; Merk and Prialnik, 2006), with frozen water ice still clearly visible in contemporary comets (Sunshine et al., 2006). Wickramasinghe et al. (2009) have also claimed that comets could allow for liquid water near perihelion based on surface temperatures above 300 K. However, the assertion that life evolved and persists in comets has been roundly criticized (Horneck, 1995). Bar-Nun et al.

In addition, it has been noted that organisms thus far claimed to be inhabitants of comets show no specific adaptations to that niche (Jalasvuori et al., 2009; Vaidya, 2010).",

This early appearance of life, combined with evidence suggesting that many complex biochemical processes were present in the LUCA, has led Line (2002) to consider that an extraterrestrial origin of life was necessary to provide sufficient time for these evolutionary innovations to develop. How much time was available for early life to evolve from a \u201cprebiotic\u201d state to life as we know it is still unknown \u2013 it has been recently suggested that early \u201csterilizing impacts\u201d were not sufficient to wipe out thermophiles (Abramov and Mojzsis, 2009) and that Earth could have been reseeded by impact ejecta (Wells et al., 2003), in which case life may have had more time to develop on Earth than previously supposed. Evidence for this period of Earth\u2019s history is missing from the geological record, though it may be preserved as ejected meteorites on the moon or other bodies (Crawford et al., 2008).",

There are naturally pitfalls in any potential interpretation of such data, and Ebach et al. (2008a) caution us to heed the past failures of biogeography and not seek to draw conclusions where data is scanty or lacking. This viewpoint earned criticism from ardent supporters of panspermia as geocentric (Wallis et al., 2008) though it has been noted that at this point, we cannot help but be \u201cgeocentric\u201d (Ebach et al., 2008b). The discovery of biochemically related life would be unlikely to quell this debate since it would undoubtedly be difficult to resolve its provenance (Pace, 2001). Indeed, it is likely that the discovery of ET life would only deepen the mystery of our origins.",

Unfortunately, science\u2019s power to explain these phenomena is constrained by ambiguous, controversial, or nonexistent data. The study of astrobiology therefore is often significantly influenced by opinion \u2013 Sir Francis Younghusband\u2019s musings on this subject remain relevant even today to discussions of panspermia:\nThe onus of proving that nowhere else throughout the whole mighty universe than on this tiny speck of a planet does life appear rests upon those who deny it.

The debates over the ALH84001 meteorite as well as the Apex Chert microfossils were possible because multiple parties could analyze the same samples critically and have done much to give us a clearer picture of the challenges that will undoubtedly face scientists as we gain more information about life in the universe \u2013 the same rigorous debate, with falsifiable hypotheses, is essential for any serious discussion of panspermia. Such debate is now going on regarding the possible substitution of arsenic for phosphorus in DNA, another problem put forward as one of astrobiology (Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011a). Carl Sagan\u2019s \u201cExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\u201d (Sagan, 1979), stated in the context of UFOs (unidentified flying objects) has seemed to plague astrobiologists. But in science do we really only require \u201cordinary\u201d evidence for \u201cordinary\u201d claims? We suggest not, that is, that all claims in science are open to the same degree of scrutiny. The strongest claims are those that have passed the most scrutiny. The record for panspermia claims in this ordinary science regard is spotty. We are presently faced with the unproven belief that life could be widespread in the universe, fortified by the presence of organic matter in meteorites and elsewhere, contrasted with our certainty that life exists on earth. That should be enough to motivate us to continue the search, with humility:\nI find that as beginners in this business most people are brash but after they have stayed in it a while, they tend to become more humble.
