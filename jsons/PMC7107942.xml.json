Seven of the patients had a history of hypertension, 6 had a history of chronic liver disease (including liver cirrhosis), 3 had a history of diabetes, 3 had a history of coronary heart disease, 10 had a history of other chronic diseases, 15 had a history of \u2a7e2 chronic diseases, and 1 was pregnant. Sixty-seven patients (40.6%) had a history of close contact with a person with confirmed SARS. Forty patients (24.2%) had a history of close contact with a person with confirmed SARS and belonged to the group of persons with a history of infection with the SARS virus. There was definite evidence that 12 patients (7.3%) had infected other persons. Forty-six patients (27.9%) had only a history of travel to or residence in (within 2 weeks before the onset of SARS) an area where there had been recent local transmission of SARS.",

For a given degree of hypoxia, the compensatory functions of the heart, lungs, and kidneys in patients aged \u2a7e50 years are worse than those of patients aged <50 years. Therefore, it is easy for multiorgan failure to occur in these patients and to increase the risk factors for death. In addition, the percentage of persons with chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes) increases with increasing age; this undoubtedly increases the risk of death for these patients. According to our analysis of the clinical data, the mortality rate among patients aged \u2a7e50 years is 13.06 times that for patients aged <50 years (P < .01); this is consistent with the results reported by Lee et al.

Because high doses of glucocorticoid hormones are necessary for the treatment of severe SARS, if a patient has the underlying condition of diabetes, his or her illness state will be aggravated, because glucocorticoid hormones can increase the levels of hepatic and muscular glycogen and the blood sugar level. If a patient has the underlying condition of hepatitis or hepatic cirrhosis, his or her illness state will also be aggravated, because glucocorticoid hormones can inhibit the immune system, resulting in active replication of hepatitis viruses or even hepatic necrosis. In patients with hypertension, the illness state can be aggravated, because glucocorticoid hormones can increase blood pressure by causing storage of sodium and discharge of potassium.",

For example, the platelet count at hospital admission was 90 \u00d7 109 platelets/L in 1 patient who died. However, the platelet count progressively decreased with the aggravation of illness of state (from 90, to 89, to 75, to 20, to 17, to 15, and then to 6 \u00d7 109 platelets/L) in the 23 days after the onset of SARS.",

The major reason is that the pathological basis of severe SARS is similar to that of severe ARDS: damage to the pulmonary capillary membrane caused by pulmonary local inflammatory reaction, which is mediated by various inflammatory cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) and loses control of inflammatory reaction [11\u201313]. The damage to the pulmonary capillary membrane usually causes platelet aggregation and microthrombus formation in pulmonary micrangia, resulting in a decrease in the platelet count and in platelet consumption [14].",

According to studies published previously [9\u201313], massive formation of transparent membrane in the alveolar cavity is found in dead patients who had SARS. This results in a decrease in pulmonary compliance, an increase in intrapulmonary shunting, and an imbalance in ventilation and blood flow. The clinical manifestations included massive consolidation visible on chest radiographs, breathing difficulty, respiratory distress, and obstinate hypoxemia. The larger that the range of consolidation range in lungs and the number of involved lobes were, the higher the respiratory rate was. Furthermore, the prognosis worsened with an increase in the degree of severity of hypoxemia. We classified hypoxemia into 4 grades (see Patients, Materials, and Methods). Grade 2 hypoxemia conforms with the standard for mild SARS, grade 3 conforms with the standard for severe SARS, and grade 4 (severe hypoxemia) conforms with the standard for type I respiratory failure. Using this classification system, the degree of hypoxemia can be easily judged in clinical practice.",

Damage to the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, or spleen can result in an increase in the levels of LDH, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase. The more serious is the pulmonary consolidation or damage of organs (other than the lungs), the higher are the levels of LDH, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase. Our study showed that LDH level, aspartate aminotransferase level, and creatine kinase level during the advanced stage of SARS were significantly increased in patients who died, compared with those who survived (P < .01). It is well known that CK-MB is a specific enzyme that reflects myocardial condition. In this study, it was found that the CK-MB level during the advanced stage of disease was significantly elevated in patients who died, compared with those who survived (P < .001). This suggests that myocardial damage was more serious in patients who died than in those who did not. It also indicates that increased CK-MB levels in patients with SARS indicates myocardial damage and a bad prognosis.",

Because hypoxia is more serious in severe cases of SARS, the percentage of patients with abnormal urea levels is significantly higher among those with severe SARS than among those with mild SARS (P < .05). Moreover, the level of internally originated toxic substances is high in patients with severe cases. These high levels aggravate renal dysfunction, which might result in renal functional failure, which affects recovery and prognosis of the patients. In this study, we found that changes in both creatinine and urea levels during the advanced stage significantly correlated with prognosis (P < .01 and <.05, respectively).
