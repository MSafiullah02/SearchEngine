            "text": "There are several hundreds of different RNA viruses that cause wide spread diseases in plants and animals. Due to the RNA nature of their genomes, these viruses have to utilize many RNA-binding proteins of both viral and host origin, for their replication. Since replication of viral genomic RNA takes place in the cytosol of the infected cells, viruses must be capable of recognizing and amplifying only their own genomes while discriminating against the numerous cellular RNAs present in cells. Overall, the efficiency and specificity of viral RNA genome amplification is quite remarkable since the host itself lacks pre-existing RNA replication machinery and RNA viruses have very limited-coding capacity. Therefore, it is predictable that RNA viruses would co-opt host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to facilitate their replication or evade host RNA degradation pathways.",

Despite the diverse genome expression strategies, (+)RNA viruses employ a common approach for replication. After entry into host cells, the genome of (+)RNA virus is released from the virion and serves as mRNA exploiting the host translation machinery. Once sufficient amounts of viral RdRp protein and other ancillary replication proteins are synthesized, the viral (+)RNA is rescued from translation into genome replication. Replication produces negative-strand (\u2212)RNA, which, in turn, serves as template for the synthesis of new (+)RNA progeny. In the case of several groups of (+)RNA viruses, replication also leads to the generation of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. Replication of (+)RNA viruses is an asymmetric process, resulting in a 10- to 100-fold excess of the positive- over negative-strand RNAs. An intriguing feature of virus replication is that the newly made viral (+)RNAs participate in several competing processes, such as new rounds of translation, replication or encapsidation.1,2 For plant (+)RNA viruses, the new (+)RNA progeny also participate in cell-to-cell movement. It is likely that RBPs play critical roles in determining the localization and selected function of viral (+)RNAs during any given period of infection.",

            "text": "Viral (+) RNA replication is a selective process since viruses are known to replicate only the cognate or very closely related (+)RNA genomes, but discriminate against heterologous viruses and the abundant cellular RNAs. The current models predict the selectivity of (+)RNA replication is due to specific template selection by dedicated viral replication proteins and less frequently by the viral-coded RdRp proteins, such as protein A for Flock house virus.50 Accordingly, the partially or fully purified RdRp preparations from virus infected cells often display limited template specificity.21 The promiscuity of viral RdRp in vitro is in contrast with high selectivity of viral replication in vivo. How viral replicase discriminates its cognate template from numerous cellular RNAs in the infected cells remains an enigma for many viruses. The emerging evidence suggests that viral replication proteins can bind selectively to specific cis-acting elements, called viral recognition elements, in the viral (+)RNA genomes. Indeed, mutations of these RNA elements severely impair virus replication as shown for several (+)RNA viruses.12,13,15\u201318,51,52 For instance, the auxiliary replication protein p33 of TBSV forms a homodimer or a heterodimer with p92pol RdRp and specifically recognizes a C\u2022C mismatch present within a stem-loop structure located in an internal replication element (RE) within the RdRp coding sequence in the (+)RNA genome. The binding of p33 to RE is absolutely required for selective recruitment of the TBSV (+)RNA into replication.16,53,54 However, it is highly possible that host RBPs could also contribute to the recruitment of TBSV (+)RNA. Accordingly, eEF1A has been found to bind specifically to the stem-loop 3 (SL3) in the 3\u2032 UTR of TBSV,38 which stimulates the recruitment of (+)RNA template to cellular membranes. Chemical inhibitors of eEF1A, which block eEF1A-RNA binding, inhibits membrane association of TBSV (+)RNA and represses viral RNA synthesis in vitro.55 For BMV, the helicase-like replication protein 1a mediates the recruitment of genomic RNAs to replication. The recruitment also requires the binding of host deadenylation complex Lsm1-7 to the tRNA-like structure (TLSs) within the 3\u2032-UTR of BMV RNAs.56,57",

For example, antiviral effect could be manifested by a host protein via specific binding to the viral (+)RNA followed by RNA degradation or redirecting/sequestering the viral (+)RNA to particular cellular compartments (away from the regular replication sites), preventing the viral (+)RNA from executing its normal functions. This strategy could be especially potent at the early stages of virus infection, when only single or a few copies of viral (+)RNAs are present in the infected cells, possibly leading to a basic resistance mechanism against viruses. Such scenario has been shown for the host nucleolin protein and TBSV. Nucleolin is a nucleolus-localized protein, but it also shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. It specifically binds to a stem-loop region within the 3\u2032-UTR of TBSV genomic RNA and inhibits TBSV replication when it is present at the beginning, but not at the late stage of virus infection.48 Deletion of nucleolin binding sites from TBSV genome renders the replication of mutant RNA independent of the presence of nucleolin. Based on in vitro assay using cell-free extract from yeast model host, nucleolin has been found to inhibit TBSV replication likely by interfering with the recruitment of the viral (+)RNA for replication.48 Similarly, Arabidopsis NTR1 protein with three hnRNP K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domains has been shown to specifically bind to both 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) genome and to inhibit ToMV multiplication. BTR1 inhibits the translation of a reporter mRNA harboring a ToMV BTR1-binding site, suggesting that it may inhibit ToMV replication at the early stage of infection that might include (+)RNA recruitment.75",

Indeed, when ribosome-bound bacteriophage Q\u03b2 RNA is used as template for replication, the Q\u03b2 replicase is not able to complete the (\u2212)RNA synthesis efficiently.2 Similarly, translating ribosome also inhibits PV RNA synthesis.76 Treatment of cell-free translation and replication-compatible lysate with puromycin after translation, which induces dissociation of translating ribosome from mRNA, stimulates genome replication. On the other hand, additional translation inhibitors such as cycloheximide, which \u201cfreeze\u201d the ribosome on mRNA, have inhibitory effect on viral RNA synthesis highlighting the necessity of clearance of ribosome from viral (+)RNA prior to replication.1 Therefore, (+)RNA viruses need to temporally coordinate these two processes to allow sufficient production of viral proteins before switching to replication. Such translation-replication balance has also been shown to be important for efficient amplification of Q\u03b2 in an in vitro reconstituted system.77 In addition, viral genomic (+)RNAs need to avoid degradation by mRNA decay pathways after translation in order to be recruited to subsequent replication.",

Indeed, interaction of PV 3CD protein with stem-loop D of the cloverleaf structure at the 5\u2032 end of PV (+)RNA greatly increases the binding affinity of PCBP2 to stem-loop B, resulting in repositioning of PCBP2 from the translation element (IRES) to the replication element (i.e., the cloverleaf structure).65 These events lead to inhibition of translation and promotion of RNA synthesis65,76 (Fig. 1B). The dual roles of PCBP2 in PV translation and replication place PCBP2 in an ideal position to mediate the switch from translation to replication. It appears that viral 3CD serves as a \u201csensor\u201d to measure viral protein translation, while PCBP2 acts as a \u201cmolecular switch\u201d. The involvement of PCBP2 in PV replication is facilitated by the proteolytic cleavage of PCBP2 by the viral protease 3C/3CD during the mid-to-late phase of infection.82 While the full-length PCBP2 with three RNA-binding (KH) domains binds selectively to the stem-loop IV of IRES,83 the proteolytic cleavage within a linker sequence between KH2 and KH3 renders the truncated PCBP2 protein (which lacks the KH3 domain) unable to bind to IRES. This leads to inhibition of PV translation.82 Interestingly, the truncated form of PCBP2 still maintains the activity to rescue PV (+)RNA replication in a PCBP2-depleted extract. This led the authors to propose an elegant model for translation-replication switch based on viral protease-mediated cleavage of PCBP2 (Fig. 1B).",

Efficient Lsm1-7-mediated translation also required specific RNA structures in the IR, whose deletion resulted in strong inhibition of RNA3 translation, while increased the recruitment of RNA3 into replication.87 The interaction of BMV RNA3 with Lsm1-7 might lead to clearance of translation initiation factors as described for cellular mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tail.88,89 Then, the formed mRNP complex is recruited to processing body (P-body),88,89 where the P-body components might facilitate replicase assembly by concentrating viral RNAs and replication protein in discrete compartment without the competition of translating polyribosome.

            "text": "It is becoming evident that the assembly of functional viral RCs is a highly regulated process, which involves complex interactions among viral (+)RNA, the viral replication proteins and co-opted host proteins and lipids. The viral genomic (+)RNA can serve as a platform for the assembly of the viral RC. For example, purified preparations of TBSV p33/p92pol, BMV 1a/2apol and Alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) P1/P2 are nonfunctional in vitro when purified from yeast or plant cells in which these replication proteins are expressed in the absence of cognate viral RNAs.94\u201397 In contrast, when the above viral proteins are co-expressed with the cognate (+)RNAs, then the obtained viral replicases become active and are able to utilize added RNA templates in vitro. To explain the replicase \u201cactivation\u201d phenomenon, it has been suggested that the complexes of these replication proteins must be assembled via the help of the viral RNAs that likely serve as \u201cassembly platforms\u201d. Detailed works defined that only short regions within the viral (+) RNAs are required for the assembly/activation of the BMV and TBSV RdRps.10,11 Although the mechanism of viral RdRp activation by (+)RNA template has not yet been determined, it is possible that the presence of viral (+)RNA may trigger conformation changes in the viral RdRps. Alternatively, viral RNA could be essential for recruitment of cellular RBPs to form functional viral RC. Indeed, the roles of host RBPs in replicase assembly and function has been documented for Q\u03b2 bacteriophage (Fig. 2A). In addition to virus-encoded polymerase \u03b2-subunit, functional Q\u03b2 replicase holoenzyme also contains three host translation factors: ribosomal protein S1 and elongation factors Tu (EF-Tu) and EF-Ts. \u03b2-subunit is the catalytic core of the replicase and the interaction of \u03b2-subunit with EF-Tu and EF-Ts is essential to maintain its polymerization activity (Fig. 2A).98 The replicase binding to the (+)RNA template is mediated by S1, which recognizes two internal sites (M and S site), while EF-Tu is involved in binding to the (\u2212)RNA template.74 Crystal structure of \u03b2 subunit in complex with EF-Tu and EF-Ts shows that the co-opted translation elongation factors have chaperone-like function to maintain the folding of the active \u03b2-subunit. EF-Tu:Ts may also regulate RNA folding and contribute to separation of RNA duplex formed between the template and nascent strands.99,100 An additional Q\u03b2 host factor, known as Hfq, is recruited by binding to 3\u2032-end of Q\u03b2 genome and is required for (\u2212)RNA synthesis101 (Fig. 2A).",

For example, Q\u03b2 replicase is thought to bind to an internal recognition site (M site), which is about 1,450 nt away from the 3\u2032-end of the genome.111 A long-range RNA-RNA base-pairing that forms between the loop of the 3\u2032 terminal hairpin and a 1,200 nt upstream sequences serves to bring the Q\u03b2 replicase in close proximity to the 3\u2032-terminus prior to initiation.112,113 Similarly, in the case of TBSV, a long-distance base-pairing between internal replication protein binding site and 3\u2032-UTR is essential for (\u2212)RNA synthesis and replicase assembly.114 Genome cyclization of Dengue virus (DENV) is mediated via long-distance RNA-RNA interaction of complementary sequences in the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR, including the cyclization sequences (CS) and upstream AUG region (UAR), which is required for genome replication.115\u2013117 Also, a kissing-loop interaction between a sequence within the HCV NS5b coding region and the 3\u2032-UTR is essential for HCV replication and is proposed to facilitate the coordination of the viral polymerase to the very 3\u2032-end of the viral genome.118 The above-mentioned long-distance RNA-RNA interaction has been observed in the absence of protein, however, it is possible that host RBPs may facilitate or stabilize these RNA structures.",

            "text": "eEF1A is one of the most common RBPs that has been identified in association with 3\u2032-UTR of a wide variety of (+) RNA viruses.54,105\u2013107,122 Mutation analysis of eEF1A-binding sites within the 3\u2032-UTR of WNV revealed correlation between eEF1A binding and (\u2212)RNA synthesis. eEF1A also interacts with WNV NS5 protein and is co-localized with the WNV RC in the infected cells, suggesting that it facilitates the interaction between the viral replicase and the 3\u2032-UTR of the viral gRNA.105 Similarly, eEF1A has been shown to interact with TBSV replication proteins and 3\u2032-UTR of viral RNA and is an integral component of the viral RC (Fig. 2B).54 A set of mutants of eEF1A was found to enhance TBSV RNA replication in yeast and increase (\u2212)RNA synthesis in a cell-free TBSV replicase assay. Moreover, eEF1A was shown to stimulate initiation of (\u2212)RNA synthesis in vitro by a closely related recombinant viral RdRp, suggesting a direct role of eEF1A in (+)RNA virus replication.55 This function of eEF1A could be facilitated by binding of eEF1A to a regulatory RNA element, termed replication silencer, which base-pairs with the extreme 3\u2032-terminus of the viral RNA and downregulates (\u2212)RNA synthesis in vitro.123 The binding of eEF1A to p92pol,38 might facilitate the proper positioning of the viral RdRp over the 3\u2032-promoter to enhance the initiation events (Fig. 2B).55 Similar to TBSV replication silencer-promoter base-pairing, the 3\u2032-terminal sequence of Q\u03b2 (+)RNA also forms a pseudoknot structure with an adjacent sequence that buries the promoter. Opening up this structured sequence prior to initiation of RNA synthesis is likely due to the Hfq host factor, an Sm-like protein, which forms hexameric complexes and harbors RNA chaperone activity. Hfq is required for efficient synthesis of Q\u03b2 (\u2212)RNA both in vivo and in vitro.98 However, Q\u03b2 RNAs carrying mutations at the 3\u2032-terminus, which disrupt the pseudoknot formation, are able to replicate independent of Hfq, suggesting that the RNA chaperone function of Hfq is to \u201cunmask\u201d the 3\u2032-end and facilitate the access of the replicase to the 3\u2032-terminus of the genome during replication101 (Fig. 2A). Another similarity between tombusvirus and Q\u03b2 RNA replication is the interaction of eEF1A with tombusviruses replication proteins p33 and p92 RdRp, which leads to stabilization of p33 and stimulation of tombusvirus replicase activity,54,55 reminiscent of the functions described for EF-Tu:Ts in Q\u03b2 RC99,100 (Fig. 2A and B).",

Since hnRNP C interacts with both termini of PV (\u2212)RNA, hnRNP oligomerization could bring the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-end sequences into proximity, thus facilitating initiation of (+) RNA synthesis (Fig. 1C).104",

The binding of PCBP and 3CD to cloverleaf of (+)RNA is also required for (+)RNA synthesis. These findings led the authors to propose a trans-initiation model for PV (+)RNA synthesis, in which the PCBP and 3CD first bind to cloverleaf in (+)RNA to form an RNP complex that functions to keep the 3\u2032-end of (\u2212)RNA single stranded (by preventing the base-pairing of the 5\u2032-end of the (+)RNA with the complementary minus-strand sequence) and facilitate the delivery of 3D polymerase to the (\u2212)RNA template in trans (Fig. 1C).128",

Host RBP factors are also likely involved in regulating this process by interacting with viral replication proteins and cis-acting RNA elements. Indeed, the ratio of Q\u03b2 (+) versus (\u2212)RNA is determined by the concentration of the co-opted hfq in vitro.

Since the (+)RNA progeny must be released from the membrane-bound replicase to the cytoplasm, while (\u2212)RNA remains inside the replication compartment,129 this step could also serve to regulate (+) versus (\u2212)RNA levels. The mechanism underlying the asymmetric replication and release of (+)RNA progeny is largely unknown. An abundant metabolic enzyme GAPDH, which is recruited into the tombusvirus RC,34 has been shown to regulate asymmetrical TBSV RNA synthesis (Fig. 2B).35 Interestingly, depletion of GAPDH preferentially inhibits the accumulation of (+)RNA, resulting in a 1:1 ratio of RNA progeny of both polarities in yeast and in a natural plant host. It has been shown that GAPDH selectively binds to an AU pentamer sequence (AUUUA) present in the vicinity of the 3\u2032-terminus of TBSV (\u2212)RNA. Deletion of the AUUUA sequence also led to the production of (+) versus (\u2212)RNA RNAs in a 1:1 ratio, even in the presence of wild-type levels of GAPDH. Based on these data, it has been proposed that GAPDH binds to and retains TBSV (\u2212)RNA for multiple rounds of (+)RNA synthesis inside of the spherules containing the membrane-bound tombusviral RC (Fig. 2B). The (+)RNA progeny, which are not bound by GAPDH, then become released from the RC into the cytosol.35 It is also possible that GAPDH could play a direct role in (+)RNA synthesis, similar to that proposed for hnRNP C during PV replication.",

For example, sgRNA transcription in coronaviruses requires the interaction between 5\u2032-terminal leader sequence and an intergenic (IG) sequence immediately upstream of the initiating AUG of each ORF.133 In an attempt to identify host RBPs regulating MHV sgRNA transcription, Li et al. has found that one of the host proteins, hnRNP A1, specifically binds to the leader and IG sequences in MHV (\u2212)RNA.134 Interestingly, the binding affinity of IG to hnRNP A1 correlates with the efficiency of MHV sgRNA transcription.134,135 Overexpression of wt hnRNP A1 has been shown to stimulate MHV RNA synthesis, while expression of dominant-negative mutant of hnRNP A1 inhibited replication.136 In vitro experiments indicate that the interaction of hnRNP A1 with the leader and IG sequences is essential for sgRNA transcription.137 Furthermore, hnRNP A1 also interacts with MHV N protein,138 suggesting that hnRNP A1 could recruit the viral N protein to MHV transcription sites. Another host protein implicated in regulating MHV sgRNA transcription is PTB (hnRNP I). PTB specifically interacts with positive-strand leader sequence, as well as with the 5\u2032-UTR in (\u2212)RNA.

For example, HuR, which is a regulator of cellular mRNA stability, binds specifically to the U-rich element (URE) in the 3\u2032 UTR of SINV and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). The binding of the SINV RNA to HuR redirects the otherwise nuclear-localized HuR to cytoplasm upon SINV infection.9 Downregulation of HuR expression leads to accelerated decay of SINV mRNA and reduced virus production, indicating that HuR inhibits deadenylation-mediated degradation of SINV RNA through its binding to URE.145 Similarly, the 3\u2032 UTR of the MHV coronavirus binds to the mitochondrial aconitase, a metabolic enzyme involved in citric acid cycle, which likely increases the stability and hence increases translation of viral proteins.146",

The binding of host RBPs to stem-loop IV of internal ribosomal entry site (IRES, shown as stem-loop structures) is essential for cap-independent translation of PV genome. (B) The roles of host RBPs in a switch by the PV RNA from translation to replication. The dual roles of PCBP2 in PV translation and replication place PCBP2 in an ideal position to mediate the switch from translation to replication. The viral 3CD likely serves as a \u201csensor\u201d to measure viral protein translation, while PCBP2 acts as a \u201cmolecular switch\u201d. The involvement of PCBP2 in PV replication is facilitated by the proteolytic cleavage of PCBP2 by the viral protease 3C/3CD during the mid-to-late phase of infection. (C) The roles of host RBPs in PV RNA replication. PCBP interacts with the 5\u2032 cloverleaf structure and forms RNP with polymerase precursor 3CD protein to promote initiation of (\u2212)RNA synthesis. The replication initiation complex formed at 5\u2032-UTR, which contains the viral 3Dpol RdRp (either activated via a cleavage of the 3CD precursor to yield the matured 3Dpol or via direct recruitment of 3Dpol), is brought to 3\u2032-end by genome circularization via interaction of PCBP with PABP bound to the poly(A)-sequence in the 3\u2032-UTR. hnRNP C has been proposed to maintain the single-stranded form of the 3\u2032-end of PV (\u2212)RNA via its RNA chaperone activity, and then, recruit viral 3CD replication protein to form an initiation complex for (+)RNA synthesis. Since hnRNP C interacts with both termini of PV (\u2212)RNA, hnRNP oligomerization could bring the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-end sequences into proximity, thus facilitating initiation of (+)RNA synthesis.
