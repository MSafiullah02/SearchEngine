The taskforce felt that reducing OTPV would help the division operate in a sustainable manner, in anticipation of potential staff shortages due to illness or quarantine. Also, decreasing OTPV would reduce exposure to patients, RTTs, and clinic staff. The following steps were taken to reduce patient volume:\u2022Hypofractionation was encouraged when clinically appropriate, such as single fraction treatments for palliation of bone metastases 2\n,\n3, or short course RT in five fractions for preoperative treatment of rectal cancer 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Each section developed disease-site specific evidence-based guidelines on hypofractionation.\u2022Patients with no immediate oncologic need for RT were deferred, after approval from a multidisciplinary team.\u2022Patients were distributed between the main campus and the institution\u2019s regional locations when feasible to standardize reduced treatment hours across all centers. and most acutely reduce patient numbers at main hospital campus.\u2022Out-of-state patients were encouraged to receive treatments locally when feasible.\u2022To lower patient throughput, interval between simulation and RT start was set at a minimum of two weeks, with exceptions for clinically-urgent situations. The next available treatment start was also limited by available time slots within established treatment hours.\n",

A dedicated team of volunteers, consisting of RTTs, nurses, and physicians, was formed to navigate RT in the setting of COVID-19 positive patients. These volunteers were trained in appropriate PPE procedures. A specific treatment machine was designated for COVID-19 positive patients and infection control protocols were established. Given potential risks of exposure to other patients and clinic staff, the treatment of COVID-19 positive patients will be limited to those that can benefit from RT under rapidly progressing, life-threatening conditions. These patients will be considered for hypofractionation, in 1-5 fractions, sequestered to a single treatment machine, and given RT at the end of business day so the room can be terminally disinfected.",

The guiding emphasis underlying all policy changes was the use of evidence-based practices and discussion among clinical experts before implementation.
