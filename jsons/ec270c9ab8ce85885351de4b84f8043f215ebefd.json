Their GSEA analysis (with substantial overlap of both positive and negative immune regulators) highlights the inadequacies of database pathway annotation but adds little else (although none of the enrichment results are actually shown). There is excessive emphasis and overinterpretation of individual genes at the top of their differential lists, especially as they are not clearly T cell expressed genes. For example, the 2nd differential is an Fc receptor not known to be expressed on T cells either.... 1st is a myeloid receptor. The theme of identifying expression of genes not known to be T cell expressed is risky and consequently requires greater evidence to support its validity. 17. Figure 6 describes a complex experiment and consequently it is necessary to be absolutely clear in its representation. Specifically, a clear description of what is meant by 'virus specific killing' and hence what is being compared in 6E (and, therefore, represented and summarised in 6C,D) is missing. Some description is included deep in the methods but the formula for %killing should be made more accessible and the figure labeled to indicate its derivation as the figure is uninterpretable without it. Also, there is clearly a difference in killing in the CD47KO chronically infected mice (6D) (peptide loaded v non). This suggests that at least part of killing is CD47 independent and this should be taken into account in the calculation of virus-specific killing. It doesn't appear that this is currently the case.",

CD39 has been described as a useful surface marker of exhaustion in human cells and would be a clearer choice. Scatterplots to show the raw data would also be reassuring: these are Ag-specific CD8 populations and presumably very small populations. It would be reassuring to see the data as small differences in small populations can result in statistical significance without clear biological relevance. 20. The SIRPa + cells expand following PDL1 block but it isn't clear from the data whether they are the source population for this expansion. By comparison, a Tbet/Eomes subpopulation of exhausted cells has been clearly described to underpin the post-checkpoint expansion (see https://www.nature.com/articles/nri3862 and references within).

The upregulation of SIRPa appears to be a generalized phenomenon and occurs following both LCMV and FV infections of mice as well as during HCV infection. The patterns of SIRP1a expression by CD8 T cells resembles that of PD-1 which is known to be expressed by exhausted T cells and attenuates their function. During chronic infections the SIRP1a expressing and non-expressing cells are distinct, with SIRP1a expression associated with the more proliferatively active and functional subset of cells. These cells also appear to be the subset that is responsive to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. The studies are logical, informative, and well described. Strengths of the study include the identification of SIRP1a subsets in multiple systems (FV, LCMV, and HCV) and species (mice and humans). Also, the detection of SIRP1a on CD8 T cells is novel as it is typically expressed by non-lymphocytes. It is also notable that the authors show that SIRP1a influences the targeted killing activities of anti-viral CD8 T cells towards CD47 (the SIRP1a-ligand) expressing cells. Although there are strengths and novel aspects to the report, there are some issues, primarily with significance that limit enthusiasm, as outlined below.",

            "text": "This is an interesting study of SIRPa which emerged from a screen of genes which appear with a similar trajectory to PD-1 in LCMV infecton. The authors provide evidence that SIRPa expression is linked to a sub-fraction of cells with distinct functions. Since SIRPa has not been shown to be expressed on T cells this is a novel finding. It is not yet clear whether SIRPa is responsible for the distinct functionality of the cells. . It would be worth probably comparing these datasets by GSEA ( ideally staining of such MCMV specific populations could be informative). Even if a negative result it would be worth checking in light of the CX3CR1/KLRG1 combination. 5. The relative distribution of SIRPa cells would be informative-this comment is prompted by the finding of CCR6 and CXCR6 on the gene list. This may reflect redistribution to certain tissues such as the liver, but also by findings of proliferation of cells in the lymph node following PD1 blockade. This may also be relevant for the conclusions and interpretation. 6. The enhanced killing of CD47 ko cells is interesting and suggests a functional interaction that is significant. However, it is not possible to tell if this is on the side of the target or the effector. In these experiments it should be possible to test if SIRPa+ cells show differential activation compared to SIRPa-cells and also if they showed differential activation/cytokine release depending on CD47+ or -target. 7. The human data are not really in keeping with the rest of the paper. These are bulk cells, of which HCV-specific cells will be a tiny fraction. Also the patients are largely treated, so overall although there are some non-specific effects of HCV on other CD8 populations, I do not think it is possible to conclude so much from this part of the study. It would be really valuable to show that SIRPa is expressed on human cells under similar conditions. This could be done first off in vitro. Analysis of HIV+ patients' tetramer+ populations would be ideal if available. Also it would be important to see the FACS/Cytof staining data in such a study. 8. In the discussion could the authors describe the relevant phenotypes of SIRPa ko mice, which have been established for a while. There seems to be some confusion regarding the LCMV results in Figure 1A in which we identified Sirp\u03b1 as having a similar expression pattern to Pdcd1, not as being coexpressed. Regarding the Dunnett's post-test: as stated in the legend, \"SIRP\u03b1 and PD-1 expression were analyzed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test with each time-point compared to time zero.\" To address the issue of other genes and the threshold criteria, we have added a section on page 7 of the results and Supplemental Figure 1 showing that 1488 genes significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with Pdcd1 expression in acute and chronic LCMV infection. When all of the genes are organized by order of correlation with the expression pattern of Pdcd1, Sirp\u03b1 ranked in the 97 th percentile. CD8+ T cell Sirp\u03b1 expression significantly correlates with Pdcd1 expression at a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.516 and p-value of 0.001263.",

We appreciate the suggestion of adding in this analysis and have also added an additional Supplemental Table 3 with a Venn diagram now highlighting a transcriptional signature of genes that are upregulated along with SIRP\u03b1 that are present in both LCMV and FV specific T cells. We think that the Reviewer must be referring to Fig. 1A because the Friend Virus section already provided raw data. Thus, we have added representative raw flow cytometry data as a new Fig. 1B for LCMV. With regard to our novel identification of SIRP\u03b1 expression on T cells, our guess is that previous testing for expression was predominantly done on na\u00efve T cells rather than activated CTLs. Analysis of the publicly available data presented in Figure 1A clearly shows that others have indeed identified expression of SIRP\u03b1. In addition, SIRP\u03b1 RNA is expressed during LCMV infection but not on na\u00efve cells, just as we show for FV infections. We have added a statement to this effect to the first paragraph of the discussion as suggested. Furthermore, comparative analysis of SIRP\u03b1 expression on T cells with that on macrophages has been added as supplemental Fig. 3 . Cross reactivity between SIRP gene products has been an issue with the humanspecific antibodies and the question of specificity is certainly important. That said, the mAb p84 we use for flow cytometry is specific for mouse SIRP\u03b1 and we have added a short section to the materials and methods to address this issue: \"mAb p84 specificity: Signal regulatory proteins (SIRP\u03b1 and SIRP\u03b2 in the mouse) are known to be expressed on neurons, hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid cells including macrophages, monocytes, granulocytes and dendritic cells 1 . Dendritic cells, macrophages and mononcytes from mice with targeted SIRP\u03b1 gene disruptions completely lose reactivity with anti-SIRP\u03b1 mAb p84 even though their SIRP\u03b2 expression is not affected. These results indicate specificity for SIRP\u03b1 without cross reactivity for SIRP\u03b2 2 .\" Mice do not express a SIRP\u03b3 gene.",

In response to the Reviewer's comments, we have now added new data comparing in vitro CTL killing by SIRP\u03b1 + CD8 T cells and SIRP\u03b1 -CD8 T cells from acutely infected mice in Figure 5G . Although the SIRP\u03b1 + CD8 T cells from acutely infected mice killed targets with more efficiency than the SIRP\u03b1 + CD8 T cells from chronically infected mice (p = .0079), as in chronic infections, the SIRP\u03b1 + subset had significantly better killing than the SIRP\u03b1subset.

The upregulation of SIRP\u03b1 appears to be a generalized phenomenon and occurs following both LCMV and FV infections of mice as well as during HCV infection. The patterns of SIRP1a expression by CD8 T cells resembles that of PD-1 which is known to be expressed by exhausted T cells and attenuates their function. During chronic infections the SIRP1a expressing and non-expressing cells are distinct, with SIRP1a expression associated with the more proliferatively active and functional subset of cells. These cells also appear to be the subset that is responsive to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. The studies are logical, informative, and well described. Strengths of the study include the identification of SIRP1a subsets in multiple systems (FV, LCMV, and HCV) and species (mice and humans). Also, the detection of SIRP1a on CD8 T cells is novel as it is typically expressed by non-lymphocytes. It is also notable that the authors show that SIRP1a influences the targeted killing activities of anti-viral CD8 T cells towards CD47 (the SIRP1a-ligand) expressing cells.

We have modified the conclusions and discussion accordingly and discuss possibilities of positive signaling, negative signaling or no signaling through SIRP\u03b1, pages 18, 19, 20. 19. Supp Fig 4a is helpful. The expression level of SIRPa on unstimulated cells, however, appears higher than on most activated cells..... it therefore appears that SIRPa is downregulated on activation and retained on a small subset. This is not in keeping with the remainder of the data: is the baseline level of SIRPa in SuppFig4B incorrect?",

Obviously, that is never supposed to happen and if it ever does it is our responsibility to catch it. It's disturbing both that it happened and that we didn't catch it. It was actually the data on the right that got distorted rather than the control. We can assure you that the data as now presented are correct and have not been altered or manipulated in any way. We have also gone back and checked all the figures to make sure all are correct.

It does remain uncertain regarding why this molecule is upregulated and how it is functioning to regulate the anti-viral response. Thus, some level of concern regarding significance remains. The other issue that was not well addressed is the biological impact of the SRP1a cells in vivo. It may be possible to investigate this point with adoptive transfer and challenge studies, however, this is not a major hold up and it is understood that certain reagents are not available.",

Are the Dex+ cells in chronic FV infection actually exhausted? The evidence presented in Fig 5 would suggest not (no difference in acute/chronic, irrespective of PD-1 or SIRP staining). The missing data on cytotoxicity from acutely infected mice might help address this, but it would still appear to be inconsistent with the GZMB/CD107a staining which implies similar degranulation. The models used in Fig5 and earlier Figures are different (adoptive transfer vs endogenous response measurement), with the cytotoxicity model requiring adoptive transfer rather than using endogenous cells.

Clarification of this process would be helpful. 2. In Fig 1B the authors show summary SIRPa MFI values showing a modest shift in normallydistributed MFI values on LCMV-specific CD8 T cells at d8pi. I was interested to see an example of the scatterplot gating driving this modest shift in MFI on what may be a very small population (and hence very sensitive to small shifts) -ie as shown in Fig1D for FV. I cannot see such raw data in Fig1B (summary MFI) and SuppFig2 relates to FV infection. Supp Fig 3, showing relative expression cf macrophages doesn't directly address this point (ie what are the relative protein levels on exhausted vs non-exhausted cells?).

This could be shown with PD1 for comparison with the FLV experiments. 4. The phenotypes of SIRPa+ v -cells are interesting in Fig 2. Sustained CX3CR1 expression looks to be at an intermediate level which has been shown recently to be associated with sustained proliferative capacity in LCMV and also persistent MCMV infections.

The average MFI of SIRP\u03b1 expression is shown in the right panel (P = 0.0088 by unpaired t test).Our search of the literature shows no instances of anyone testing SIRPa protein expression on activated T cells. If the reviewer knows of such an instance and provides a reference we would be happy to examine and discuss the results. It is obviously our responsibility to ensure the validity of our results and we have answered all reviewer's questions to prove that we have accomplished that, both at the RNA level as shown in our paper and other cited papers (Refs 75, 76,77,78), and at the protein level, with the new data shown here and particularly in depth in the Friend virus model. We cite other instances where SIRPa RNA expression was seen in CD8+ T cells but we can't answer why nobody followed up on those findings.6. It is of course reasonable to focus on the Dex+ Ag-specific cells for further analysis as the authors do. However, the data provided is far from sufficient to demonstrate the conclusion that SIRPa induction requires cognate pMHC:TCR interaction. I don't think softening this claim to a 'suggestion' is sufficient and it should be removed to avoid misleading the reader.The statement has been removed as suggested.7. I agree that gdT expression is less relevant here. Relative gDT expression levels can be found through immgen (for interest): http://www.immgen.org/databrowser/index.html 14. My criticism here was not so much that the approach is inadequate but that the interpretation of the findings may be contradictory or confusing. The authors show significant enrichment of both positive and negative 'immune regulation' pathways from the GO classification. It can therefore only be concluded that transcripts altered are involved in 'immune regulation' without inferring direction of effect.",
