This was seen with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak where policies were developed under scientific uncertainty due to lack of published evidence and limited experience with the virus (MacDougall, 2007). Some have suggested this uncertainty contributed to the failure to optimally control the outbreak in a timely manner in certain highly affected locations and resulted in unintended consequences such as lack of public confidence (National Advisory Commitee on SARS and Public Health, 2003). Given the history of serious pandemic influenza outbreaks and the emergence of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, concerns about a human influenza pandemic are paramount. As a result several governments and institutions have implemented extensive pandemic plans to be better prepared and minimize uncertainty.",

Despite extensive planning, the use of evidence to develop policies was complicated by several factors. Public health officials had to make decisions quickly, often when information was still being gathered. Coordination was necessary across multiple levels of public health (international, federal, provincial, local) and sectors (hospitals, schools, workplaces). Finally, pandemic policymaking has been shown to be influenced by political factors (Garoon & Duggan, 2008) and can be strained by antiviral and vaccine shortages, overwhelming demands on public health systems and intense public scrutiny (Timpka et al., 2009).",

Severity was expected to be moderate to severe, having the epidemiological characteristics of previous pandemics, particularly the 1968 Asian flu pandemic or seasonal influenza (Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), 2008). Participants also referenced the 1918\u201319 pandemic, avian influenza and SARS, indicating that historical memory played an important role in influencing beliefs. The health care burden was assumed to be high, having major resource implications and occupational safety concerns for health care workers.

As the outbreak unfolded it became apparent that data on severity did not match the models and underlying assumptions of most plans. Decision-making, however, continued to be framed by these models. Pandemic plans are intended to provide practical guidance and not indoctrinate ideology; however, this analysis shows that the latter prevailed.

Challenging the content of the pandemic plans, for example on the use of N95 respirators, was avoided in certain jurisdictions given the significant conflict that would arise. This is consistent with conflict avoidance as described by the conflict model of decision-making (Janis & Mann, 1977). A decision that involves a potential conflict provokes a degree of stress, the excess or absence of which is in turn a major determinant of the final decision. The N95 decision in Ontario was a result of \u201cdefensive avoidance\u201d such that the risks to labour disruption would not be worth challenging a recommendation from the pandemic plan. The school closure policy went against a priori guidance, which largely endorsed school closure as a containment strategy. According to the conflict model, the (largely societal) risks associated with school closures outweighed the risks of staying with the decision. These two policies contrast in how differences in antecedent conditions, available evidence and resulting decisional-conflict, guided the policy actions. It is possible that the nature of the situation, and not theory, explained the N95 decision as the political and non-evidentiary considerations were considered legitimate. Compared with N95, very little epidemiological evidence existed for school closures with support mostly coming from modelling studies. However, the potentially large societal costs of closing schools supported a change in direction. The vaccine sequencing decisions also largely agreed with pandemic plans although the manifestation of the policy was extremely heterogeneous across Canada and within provinces. With the adjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women, little to no a priori information existed and therefore cognitive dissonance did not apply. Instead, the precautionary principle was largely used to justify decisions.",

Verification of our findings with the document analysis is not susceptible to this recall bias and supported similar themes around the role of beliefs, information purveyors and ideologies. Nonetheless we acknowledge that hindsight may influence responses. All participants work within the public health or health care system. As a result, the views of individuals outside the public health system were not represented. While this is appropriate given our research question, these findings represent only one particular stream of perspectives. One of the limitations of using the Lomas framework in this analysis is the unidirectional flow between information domains and institutional structures for decision-making. During pH1N1, this exchange was multidirectional and several individuals were both producers of information and decision-makers within the formal structures, making it difficult to conceptually separate their unique influences. Lomas' framework also does not capture Canada's hierarchical, jurisdictional and institutional levels of decision-making and their interactions. Finally, the placement of evidence ideology in the values component of the model can be questioned as it is reflective of a normative stance versus a value trait.",

However, under the congruence of multiple pre-planning and entrenched assumptions, the precautionary principle and evidence-based paradigms, a complex situation emerges whereby the decision-making process cannot be easily tracked or justified according to a straightforward set of criteria. Pre-planned approaches have many benefits including clarifying accountability and strategy during uncertainty. However, caution needs to be exercised when pre-planned approaches are in place to ensure policy options are not constrained by plans. We suggest that pandemic plans need to be written and used in a way that accommodates dynamic responses to fit an emerging situation. This includes minimizing scenarios based on single assumptions and conducting a range of sensitivity analyses.",

Both evidential and policy considerations are important and improvements in addressing both effectively and explicitly within decision-making processes are needed. We recommend an iterative scientific review that re-considers science/evidence based on the policy landscape. The challenge with this approach is that in an EBM paradigm this can be thought of as compromising evidence. We have noted throughout our analysis that this is already happening; therefore, being more explicit about the process will allow for more critical investigation. Functionally, public health needs a model that can support these types of decision constructs, but at the same time ensure rigor. One modifiable construct that would be beneficial to amend going forward is to reconsider what constitutes evidence. This analysis suggests a more comprehensive and inclusive concept of evidence that recognizes the variety of contexts in which evidence is generated and used (Upshur, VanDenKerkhof, & Goel, 2001), and that is more appropriate during an emerging public health event. This can be facilitated by increased collaboration and discussion among researchers and policymakers to ensure the relevant evidence is generated. Such collaborations would also facilitate greater credibility of information purveyors, which is particularly important when evidence does not fit prior expectations.",

In particular, our analyses revealed that when and why evidence/advice is or is not considered needs to be clearly articulated. This includes outlining steps, logic, key assumptions, limitations and trade-offs considered, evidentiary or otherwise. The role of ideological perspectives and prior beliefs should also be made explicit given how influential they are in defining decisions from the outset. We acknowledge that detailed recording of evidence-based or consensus-derived decisions to ensure transparency may be idealistic in the face of time and other pressures during a crisis. One possible recommendation could be a more rigorous use of Incident Management System (IMS) processes which would serve not only to improve processes but also to ensure better documentation. At the minimum, critical post-outbreak analyses of detailed real-time records of the meetings and transcripts should occur to improve future public health actions. Finally, with many different groups addressing the same questions, inefficiencies still exist. The public health system needs to leverage existing relationships rather than create new structures during a pandemic. In addition, better clarity on who is responsible for answering what questions is needed to avoid duplication and mixed messages. Addressing inefficiencies will require trust and collaboration, supporting the themes identified around credibility.",
