However, the new coronavirus nucleic acid kits are in short supply and time-consuming in manipulation. Furthermore, false negatives may exist in some cases due to the insufficient viral materials in the specimen. Recent studies have reported the cases with initial SARS-CoV-2 negative but typical CT findings,12\n,\n13 however, most of them turned out to be positive after repeated tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Therefore, chest CT imaging plays a critical role in the surveillance and diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia with a higher sensitivity and efficiency than the chest X-rays do. Guan et al. also reported that 76.4% cases with viral pneumonia findings at CT were verified COVID-19.11 Based on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia, patients with typical CT imaging features in Hubei Province will be grouped as clinically-diagnosed cases, contributing to the total number of confirmed diagnosis according to the \u201cDiagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 Pneumonia (Fifth Trial Version)\u201d released by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China since February 12, 2020.14\n",

Leukocytosis (41%) and elevated neutrophil ratio (83%) were unusually noted for the COVID-19 cases. The consolidation lesions were more prevalent in the pregnant cases. The cases in the clinically-diagnosed pregnant group were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement at CT in which disputes for aggravating the patients\u2019 status took place due to the possible false negative or postponed coronavirus nucleic acid tests. Therefore, it is commonly speculated that some delay in management was worrisome in order to wait for a confirmed diagnosis. For limiting the epidemic, chest CT has been playing an indispensable role in selection of the candidates for quarantine in Wuhan and other places in China.

Early identification of COVID-19 is important for the patients as well as the healthy population. Currently, the patients should be isolated for treatment from the healthy people for controlling the epidemic. It has been reported that chest CT is superior to RT-PCR in sensitivity for early detection of COVID-19.22 Based on the epidemiological characteristics, clinically-diagnosed cases with typical CT features were treated with the same therapy in Hubei Province to offset the effects of possible false negative of the new coronavirus nucleic acid tests.13 In our study, 44% and 36% pregnant women presented initial onset of fever in either laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed group, which was less common than 87.9% in the non-pregnant population in the study by Guan et al.11 and consistent with the previous study enrolling 9 pregnant women with COVID-19.17 Currently, fever served as the basic screening flag in China. Absence of typical symptoms increased the difficulty of the surveillance in the pregnant population. Furthermore, the physiological findings about leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio due to adaptations to gestation could further complicate the situation. Nevertheless, no pregnant women were admitted to ICU.

As with the CT features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, the common characteristics in the pregnant group included pure GGO, GGO with consolidation or reticulation, and complete consolidation with predominantly peripheral distribution and bilateral lung involvement, which were similar to those of the non-pregnant group in our research as reported in the previous studies.19\n,\n20\n,\n24 There were overlaps in imaging findings between COVID-19 and other viral infections, such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pneumonia, as well as H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 infections.19\n,\n20 The patterns of GGOs or GGO with the above features in predominantly peripheral distribution will facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.20 The above imaging findings could be mostly explained by a recently published research on the pathological investigation of COVID-19.25 Diffuse alveolar injury superimposed with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and hyaline membrane formation was identified on pathology. Other findings included pulmonary edema and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (dominated by lymphocytes). Therefore, we have the GGOs, consolidations, and reticulations which indicate fibromyxoid exudates, the interstitial edema and the lymphocytes infiltrate resulting in the lymphopenia inside the blood. The more common consolidation and relatively higher TSS in the laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant women suggested the more severity in pregnant women, except for three laboratory-confirmed pregnant women showing no abnormalities related with COVID-19 pneumonia at CT. Therefore, there is no doubt that the CT study did a big favor in structuring the clinical treatment strategy for the pregnant women as we hoped. Fortunately, the infants were all normal without any evidence of vertical transmission from women with COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, which was consistent with the prior research by Chen et al. 16\n",

Fortunately, the laboratory-negative cases with typical imaging findings were supposed to receive the same treatment protocol as the positive ones in China. Pleural effusion was identified in 6/16 (38%) and 6/25 (24%) patients in the laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed pregnant groups, which was more than that in the study by Song et al.20 This phenomenon could be attributed to a common finding within 1\u201324 h of normal delivery. 26\n",

Nine children younger than 14 years out of 1011 patients were reported by Guan et al.11 Our study revealed that the non-specific abnormalities (pure GGO or consolidation) distributed without peripheral predominance at CT unlike the adults. However, when superimposed with other pathogen infections, the pulmonary involvement was more severe, as simultaneous infection of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in one child was detected in our study. Nevertheless, it was difficult to distinguish if the consolidation was associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, since the consolidation and pleural effusion were also common in pure RSV infection.27 The contact history and clinical symptoms of fever or cough may be helpful for the surveillance.",

In addition, even though it's a study conducted in two centers, the majority of patients was from the hospital majoring in women and children, then the selection bias existed. Secondly, 22 pregnant women are outpatients, thus the follow-up CT images were absent for monitoring the therapeutic effects. Finally, for the pregnant woman and children, low dose technique was implemented so that the image quality was not so good as that of the non-pregnant adult group, but fortunately it's sufficient to evaluate the lesions.",

The clinically-diagnosed pregnant cases shared similar chest CT features with the laboratory-confirmed ones, but with more severe consolidation lesions, and repeated SARS-CoV-2 tests should be implemented for these highly clinical suspicious patients, however, the negative tests will not hinder the management based on the typical clinical and imaging findings in clinical context where the COVID-19 is life-threatening. Chest CT study was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and monitoring the therapeutic effects with or without SARS-CoV-2 confirmation for this population. The chest CT imaging features of children with COVID-19 pneumonia were non-specific, while the exposure history and clinical symptoms could be more helpful for the screening.",
