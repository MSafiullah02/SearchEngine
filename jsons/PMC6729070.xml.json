This SNP can also disrupt the methylation pattern (a key modification of DNA that usually silences genes) in the regulatory region leading to cell type-specific effects. IFITM3 expression in memory CD8(+) T cells in response to viral infection has been found to protect and encourage survival of these cells allowing for the establishment of adaptive immunity. Loss of methylation at this site prevents CTCF from binding to the DNA and inducing expression of IFITM3 in response to the pathogen, thus reducing cell survival. This is estimated to lead to a 2.6-fold increased risk of a severe outcome upon IAV virus infection. IFITM3 has also been recently shown to have a protective effect on the heart during severe IAV infection. Myocarditis has been associated with IAV infection since the 1918 pandemic [68], and IAV has been shown to lead to a sixfold increased risk of myocardial infarction in the 7 days post infection [69]. So far, IFITM3 is the only gene for which SNPs have been identified and independently confirmed in vivo and in vitro to restrict IAV replication [70]. However, this gene is not specific to IAV replication and the full extent of the antiviral actions remains to be discovered.",

Further work identified a deletion in a nearby regulatory region as the element responsible for the specific effect on both protein and mRNA levels of CD55 in monocytes.

Again, this is a plausible association with severe disease: SP-B forms a key part of pulmonary surfactant and is essential for lung function.

The association was replicated by targeted genotyping in a larger cohort of 174 patients suffering severe IAV infection and 258 mildly infected controls. The risk variant corresponds to higher GLDC expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines and human lung tissues. Consistent with this effect, inhibition of GLDC in cultured bronchial epithelium using siRNA or a specific inhibitor, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), leads to an increased type I IFN response and a restriction of viral replication in vitro. This effect on viral restriction was seen with both H1N1 and H7N9, and the allele genotype was replicated in susceptibility cohorts for both viruses. The protective effect of AOAA against H1N1 was shown in mice to be comparable with that of zanamivir.",
