            "text": "Towards the end of the first decade of the 21st century, during December 2019, numerous pneumonia incidences of unidentified cause appeared in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling Flu and viral pneumonia. After virus isolation and analysis of viral genome sequence from infected patient\u2019s samples, a novel coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 (initially designated as novel coronavirus or nCoV-2019) was identified from an unknown source. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of respiratory disease which is recently named as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major concern for the health care workers and a preliminary R0 (Reproductive number: as the number of new infection one infected person generates on average throughout its infectious period) measure of 1.4\u20132.5 was reported by the WHO (https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus). Since its appearance within a months\u2019 time enormous number of new cases are piling up and the actual R0 value may be quite higher than previously calculated (Wu et al. 2020). Epidemiological data suggest that approximately (as of February 29 2020) 79,251 people infected with this virus in mainland China and multiple cases also reported from other parts of the world (https://who.sprinklr.com;https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/publichealth/84698). So far 60 other countries reported SARS-CoV-2 infection; although most of the cases are migrants of China, indicating a single introduction of this virus. Among the other countries, South Korea (3,150 cases), Italy (889 cases), Japan (234 cases), Iran (388 cases), Singapore (96 cases), HongKong (94 cases) and USA (64 cases) reported significant number of cases and the situation is getting complicated with time. Current findings indicate that various subtypes of coronaviruses are in circulation within the bat population including other species such as birds, cats, dogs, pigs, mice, horses, whales before they acquire the ability to cross the species barriers to cause human infection. It is still unanswered that how SARS-CoV-2 has caused an outbreak in Wuhan. The initial wave of infection found associated with the seafood market of Wuhan, strengthening the hypothesis that close contact between the live or dead animal with an individual may be responsible for the initiation of the outbreak. In the recent past there are examples of zoonotic transmission of bird flu which directly jumped from avian species to human, but no transmission between the humans were established which kept the disease under control. However, the ability to spread among human to human upon close contact makes SARS-CoV-2 as a very important contagious agent to study and monitor whose devastation has already been established in Wuhan, Hubei, China.",

Total number of cases reached to 20,000 in first 12 days, 40,000 in next 7 days and more than 80,000 in just 33 days. Infections are causing varied clinical manifestation from mild symptoms to severe respiratory attacks, although there is possibility of asymptomatic infection.

            "text": "History has taught several lessons regarding the endemic nature of emerging viral infections. Virus faces major challenges from pre-existing immunity to remain in the population. Other important factors such as case fatality rate (CFR), R0 and the reservoir hosts are crucial in influencing viral endemicity. By analysing CFR of different RNA viruses and their longevity in circulation throughout the globe, it was found that viruses with higher CFR (CFR >5%) die out after few passages of infections sooner or later, whereas viruses with low CFR remain endemic with a seasonal outbreak like common flu caused by influenza viruses (Figure 1). Although it is very difficult to calculate actual CFR until the outbreak ends, an initial estimate suggests that CFR for SARS-CoV-2 is 2.58%, much closer to seasonal flu than the other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERs-CoV) of the recent past (i.e. 10% and 35%, respectively, https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/) indicating the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 to remain in circulation with low CFR throughout the world. As per the recent data, COVID-19 has already claimed 2,924 lives, mainly in China although few deaths reported from other parts of the world. However, as of February 29 2020, 39,556 infected individuals already recovered from SARS-CoV2 infection, who will eventually acquire immunity to the virus. (https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/publichealth/84698). The Covid-19 recovered population increases day by day, with herd immunity of the population. A virus may re-infect a person with pre-existing immunity, either in its present form (which is very unlikely), or with acquired mutations to persist in the circulation. SARS-CoV-2 recovered populations may enable the selection of mutant viruses, and their spread in the community.",

The S proteins are cleaved into the receptor binding S1 domain, and cell membrane fusion S2 domains. The SARS-CoV-2 S2 domain represents higher identity with bat derived coronavirus strains than the S1 domain. Therefore, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to that of SARS-CoV 2002-03 and it has found that it uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as cellular receptor (Lu et al. 2020). However, some key amino acid substitution (at positions 439, 501, 493, 485 and 486) were observed in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain those were thought to be important in SARS-CoV (Lu et al. 2020).

Variable numbers of small ORFs are present between the various conserved genes downstream to the N gene. The 3a protein of SARS-CoV modulates virus release by forming a transmembrane homotetramer complex within channel protein. Other than the virus release, the 3a protein helps in SARS-CoV-induced cell death, Golgi fragmentation, and the accumulation of intracellular vesicles. Like the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV the SARS-CoV-2 virus possesses several other small ORFs (ORF9, ORF13, ORF14, ORF10) at the downstream to N gene (Marra et al. 2003).

However, further analysis of the amino-terminal domain of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV revealed that 19 out of the 20 cysteine residues was spatially conserved within the betacoronavirus group (Rota et al. 2003). On the other hand, only five residues were found conserved within the alphacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus group (Rota et al. 2003). Furthermore, the subsequent whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis concluded that SARS-CoV is a member of the betacoronavirus lineage.

From the analysis of the sequences published since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, it is evident that this virus is stably spreading without any noticeable mutation as they are clustered in a single group. Analysis from the phylogenetic tree represents that all the SARS-CoV-2 strains are distinctly separated from previously reported coronavirus endemic strains; SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Hence, the SARS-CoV-2 is termed as \u201cnovel\u201d coronavirus. Analysis performed in our study also revealed that this virus is very similar to the bat derived coronavirus strain. The SARS-CoV-2 and bat derived Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 coronavirus strain derived from common ancestor, although they differs in in the size of the spike genes (spike gene size in RaTG13:3809 bp; SARS-CoV-2:3822bp). Since SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV also derived from the bat, bat originated human infecting coronavirus strain is not a novel event. As shown in earlier studies that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV used civets and camel, respectively, as an intermediate host to gain infection potentiality towards human (Guan et al. 2003; Alagaili et al. 2014). It may be predicted that in case of SARS-CoV-2 transmission there may be one or more intermediate host present in between bats and human.",

Initial data from China shows that the SARS-CoV-2 produced observable symptoms, primarily ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) in elderly populations similar to human cases of H7N9 infection in China (Table 1). An earlier study with H7N9 infection also found the clinical exhibition of disease with high fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics (Chen et al. 2013). A recent study on SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that all the 41 patients had pneumonia and manifestations of a critical respiratory ailment similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality (Huang et al. 2020).",

ACE2 is an essential enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining electrolyte and fluid homeostasis. ACE2 also protects an individual against severe acute lung damage that can be triggered by sepsis, acid aspiration, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the lethal avian influenza A H5N1 and H7N9 virus infection (Kuba et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2014; Zou et al. 2014). Moreover, recent studies have shown that ACE2 negatively regulates inflammatory responses during bacterial or viral infections (Yang et al. 2014; Sodhi et al. 2019). SARS-CoV-2 infection utilizes ACE2 for viral attachment and subsequent entry into cytosol, therefore rapid replication of SARS-CoV-2 may reduce the surface expression of ACE2 in the lung tissue which may cause further intensification of the inflammation and severity of the disease pathology (Glowacka et al. 2010) (Figure 4). A recent study have found that smoking is associated with higher expression of ACE2 when compared with the non-smokers, which may be one of the reasons of some population for the vulnerability towards novel SARS-CoV-2 infection (Liu et al. 2017; Cai 2020).",

In absence of any specific antiviral drugs, the primary therapeutic strategy to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection should be managing the inflammatory responses with anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids. Previous studies on SARS patients have found a positive outcome when treated with corticosteroids (Chen et al. 2006). WHO recommendations for managing this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection discourage the application of corticosteroids. The explanation for not using corticosteroids could be delayed viral clearance from the respiratory tract or blood with other corticosteroid-induced complications in the treated patients previously infected with SARS and MERS (Lee et al. 2004; Arabi et al. 2018; Russel et al. 2020). During the pandemic in 2009 of influenza A infection, a prospective cohort study showed reduced mortality in patients with (H1N1) pdm09 viral pneumonia when treated with mild doses of corticosteroid (Li et al. 2017). Therefore these disparities in findings suggest that randomized controlled trials must be carried out to conclude the beneficial effect of corticosteroid medication in coronavirus-induced inflammation associated difficulties. However, doctors from the Chinese Thoracic Society have recommended the application of corticosteroids to critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a low to moderate dose (\u22640.5\u20131 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent) for short term (<7 days) (Zhao et al. 2020).",

The role of pre-existing immunity broadly studied for influenza virus infection (Biswas et al 2020). Host immunity also allows the selection of mutant viruses to cause a new round of infection within the host with pre-existing immunity towards the earlier strains. If the SARS-CoV-2 can withstand the new mutations and remains flexible to infect its host towards disease progression, it will persist in circulation. The primary wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection is under progress at present. The majority of the exposed population will acquire some immunity eventually and the real hurdles for the viruses to defeat or bypass existing immunity will reflect with the acquired mutations within the virus in future. To defeat host immunity, viruses must mutate without losing their infectivity. So far there are no published data regarding infection ability of SARS-CoV-2 and their mutation potential under robust immunological selection pressure within the host. Previous data from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected individuals indicated that antibody response tends to be short-lived but remain longer depending on the severity of the infection. T cell responses often target highly conserved internal proteins and are long-lived (Channappanavar et al. 2014; Alshukairi et al. 2016). SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells but not memory B cells or antibody could be detected six years after infection in SARS survivors (Tang et al 2011). In conclusion, these studies present some ideas regarding selection pressure from the host immunity, i.e. milder coronavirus infection may produce a short-lived humoral immune response. As of February 29 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infected 85,406 people and the infection turns into fatality for more than 2,924 cases. However, as per the available data, 39,561 individual got recovered after infection. Percent recovery from this population indicates that \u223c 93% of the population already recovered from SARS-CoV2 infection. This percentage was calculated as below within infected population: (total no recovered/total no of recovered + total no of death). It can be predicted that at least 93% of the total population, which may likely to go higher with the end of this outbreak, will develop immunity towards this novel virus. So far there is no vaccine available, although in future vaccinated individual will also acquire some immunity. The possibility of the future outbreak by SARS-CoV-2 will depend on the longevity of host immunity and bypassing of existing or pre-existing immunity by the mutant virus (Figure 5).",

This observation represents that SARS-CoV-2 transmitted through droplet and human to human, might be through the orofecal route but immune-pathogenesis of this novel virus is probably different from the previous endemic strain of coronaviruses. The faecal oral route is very common in birds for transmission of avian viruses. Migratory birds play a very important role in the dissemination of avian influenza viruses from different parts of the globe during seasonal migrations (Bailey et al. 2018). Coronaviruses such as human SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoV SL-CoVZXC21 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor and recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 also uses the same receptor for entry into the host cell. We have compared the ACE2 gene from avian species and the data suggest conservation of amino acids of ACE2 protein within most of the birds (data not shown). We examined the interacting residues of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with critical residues of ACE2 from different species (from human, poultry; Gallus gallus, Mallard; Anasplatyrhynchos, swan goose; Ansercygnoidesdomesticus, shelduck; Tadornacana) and we found limited amino acids conservation in comparison to human counterpart (Table 2). Moreover, there is no experimental proof for betacoronavirus (like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) infection in the birds; although a recent study has shown the significant presence of alpha and gammacoronaviruses in ducks, shorebirds, and herons in Australia (Chamings et al. 2018). These observations allow us to believe that the birds are less prone to betacoronavirus infection or the least chance of bird infection from betacoronaviruses. Significantly, the bird poses alpha and gammacoronaviruses that are incompetent to infect a human. Hence, the risks of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 through bird to human are very unlikely at its present form. Qinghai Lake in China is one of the biggest breeding sites for different migratory bird species. There may be a possibility that this novel virus may acquire the ability to infect other animals including the migratory birds. Therefore, it is extremely important to find out the reservoir of this novel coronavirus within the other animals including the migratory birds, if there are any (Figure 6).",

If this trend continues then the virus may establish itself in the population and quarantine will be very difficult to stop the virus spread. Phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene nucleotide sequence performed in this study has shown that all the SARS-CoV-2 sequences are forming a single cluster without any branching indicating SARS-CoV-2 conservation throughout this ongoing outbreak. Earlier studies have shown that spike protein was a target of a robust humoral immune response in case of SARS or MERS viral infection. These findings advocate that virus that caused the initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is still in circulation without any major changes. Very little or absence of pre-existing immunity in the community or selection pressure within the population probably allowed SARS-CoV-2 to remain in circulation in its original form. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has very limited CFR as opposed to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV without killing its host (Table 1), will able to produce new virus particles alongside some mutations. Till now most of the deaths have occurred in the elderly population due to novel coronavirus infection whereas, children and young adults exhibit relatively milder disease. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection will enable the host to develop humoral and cell-mediated immunity and simultaneously the immune selected viruses may acquire mutations with higher infection potential or altered antigenicity. This will likely empower them to evade pre-existing immunity (towards their predecessor counterpart) in the host during the subsequent waves of infection (as depicted in Figure 1). Current estimates based on the available information, suggest that more than \u223c93% individual have recovered from this novel coronavirus infections. The virus may adapt itself to produce infection within the recovered population in future to sustain its presence in the environment. \u201cThe ability of the virus to cause infection in the host with pre-existing immunity\u201d will be the most important criteria to establish itself in the circulation. The recovered population may keep under monitor to find if any reinfection leads to the creation of any mutant strain due to the selection pressure. Therefore, we must prepare ourselves for mutant strains of this novel virus to avoid future devastation.",

            "text": "Since there is no antiviral and vaccine to fight against SARS CoV-2, a vaccine or therapeutics is a primary need at this moment. Currently, several companies have started preparing vaccines for this novel virus although efficacy will depend on the selection of antigen and the virus\u2019s ability to bypass the vaccine-induced immunity. We must look at the conservation among different epitopes in immune selected strains while choosing the right vaccine candidates. Structurally spike protein carries RBD like Haemagglutinin (HA) of the Influenza virus with a similar function. We must look at the amino acid conservation in different domain of the spike protein. Mutation in the immune dominance region of the vaccine candidate will make them ineffective for future outbreaks. Recently, physicians from China are urging recovered patients to donate plasma which may be useful to protect COVID-19, something like a 100 years old practice during 1918 flu. In case of pandemic 1918 influenza infection, three waves of infection killed more than 50 million worldwide in two years, where the second wave was the most devastating. The first wave of the 1918 flu pandemic flu had resembled common flu epidemics; people most at risk were the weak and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily apparently resembling COVID-19 in its present form. Most of the studies have found an analogy between COVID-19 and Influenza disease pathophysiology. Time will tell us whether SARS-CoV-2 and associated COVID-19 will be established as the new flu of 21st century.",
