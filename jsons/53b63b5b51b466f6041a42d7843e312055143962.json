However, they have some common phenotypic properties. They are alfa-or non-haemolytic. They can be differentiated from S. pneumoniae by resistance to optochin and the lack of bile solubility (2) . They can be differentiated from the Enterococcus species by their inability to grow in a medium containing 6.5% sodium chloride (2) . Earlier, so-called nutritionally variant streptococci were included in the VGS but based on the molecular data they have now been removed to a new genus Abiotrophia (3) and are not included in the discussion below. VGS belong to the normal microbiota of the oral cavities and upper respiratory tracts of humans and animals. They can also be isolated from the female genital tract and all regions of the gastrointestinal tract (2, 3) . Several species are included in VGS and are listed elsewhere (2, 3) . Clinically the most important species belonging to the VGS are S. mitis, S. sanguis and S. oralis.",

Most commonly the diseases are selflimiting, localized infections of the pharynx and skin (e.g. pharyngitis and impetigo). However, invasion especially from the skin can lead to septicaemia or severe deep-seated tissue infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis and myositis. Other clinical manifestations of GAS include scarlet fever, peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscesses, otitis media, sinusitis, myositis, lymphangitis, meningitis, suppurative arthritis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, erysipelas, cellulites, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, vaginitis, and balanitis (7) (8) (9) (10) .

            "text": "Penicillin and beta-lactam resistance in general, among streptococci is mediated by point mutations in the penicillinbinding proteins (PBPs). PBPs are membrane-bound trans-peptidases, active-site serine hydrolases, which catalyse cross-linking of the peptidoglycan subunits during the bacterial cell wall synthesis (18, 19) . Beta-lactam antibiotics serve as substrates for PBPs. The active-site serine reacts with the beta-lactam ring and generates a covalently linked enzymebeta-lactame intermediate. This acyl enzyme intermediate is not able to catalyse cross-linking of the peptidoglycan subunits (18) . In streptococci there are low-and high-molecularweight PBPs (20, 21) . Both of these enzymes are important for cell wall synthesis, but only the high-molecular-weight PBPs are important for the bacterial killing activity of the beta-lactam antibiotics (19) . In VGS there are two kind of high-molecular-weight PBPs: PBP1 (PBP1a and PBP1b) and PBP2 (PBP2a, PBP2b, PBP2x) (20) . Homologous molecules can be found from S. pneumoniae and naming conventions for PBPs of the VGS are adapted from S. pneumoniae (19) (20) (21) . VGS with wild-type PBSs are susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics (22) . In order to become resistant, they have to decrease the affi nity of beta-lactams to the high-molecularweight PBPs. This can be achieved by amino acid substitutions in the transpeptidase domain of the PBPs (19, 22) . One point mutation can result in slight increase in the penicillin MIC. Normally more than one mutation is needed for intermediate-level beta-lactam resistance. Highly resistant strains have accumulated several mutations in the PBPs. Based on the data obtained from S. pneumoniae; these highly resistant strains may also need mutations other than PBP (19) . Accumulation of several mutations in the PBPs may also lead to lethal mutations. Streptococci have overcome this problem by horizontal transfer of functional mutated PBPcoding genes or gene fragments. Transformation and subsequent homologous recombination has produced beta-lactamresistant VGS with mosaic PBP genes. In these mosaics of PBP genes there are gene regions obtained from resistant strains dispersed through the wild-type PBP genes (23) .",

Of the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone is the most active against VGS in vitro (24) . The NCCLS resistance breakpoint for ceftriaxone was 2 mg/L until 2002 when it changed to 4 mg/L (43, 44) . Using the old breakpoint for ceftriaxone, penicillin and ceftriaxone resistance levels are similar (Table 1) . In different studies, resistance percentages of VGS for ceftriaxone vary between 0 and 27% ( Table 1) . As expected, cefotaxime is almost as active as ceftriaxone against VGS although there is not as much resistance data available (24, 34) . It is of worth to note that a third-generation cephalosporin, ceftazidime, although very active against various Gram-negative bacteria, is not as active as penicillin, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone against VGS (8, 12) . As presented in Table 1 , most of the blood isolates have a reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime with up to 70% resistance. Resistance levels of the fourth-generation cephalosporin, cefepime, vary between 11 and 42% (Table 1 ). However, the new NCCLS breakpoint for cefepime is 4 mg/L and if that is used the highest level of resistance is 19% (30) . Whatsoever, all this data indicate that penicillin is in vitro as effective as cephalosporins against VGS although ceftriaxone has, in vitro, lower resistance fi gures than penicillin if the new NCCLS breakpoints are used (43, 44) . Imipemen, a carbapenem antibiotic, is in vitro active against VGS (45) . Most of the VGS strains have low imipenem MIC values, i.e. less than 0.5 mg/L (24, 31) . However, strains, highly penicillin resistant, can have elevated MICs (1-2 mg/L) (24). Marron et al., have found that 20% of the VGS blood isolates of neutropenic cancer patients can have imipenem MIC of 1 mg/L or more (31) . Similarly, Diekema et al. reported that 11% of VGS strains had imipenem MICs equal to or higher than 0.5 mg/L (29) . The problem with imipenem is that there are no NCCLS breakpoints for non-pneumococcal streptococci (44) . Streptococci are in vitro highly susceptible to another carbapenem compound, meropenem. Only few resistant strains with MICs as high as 2 mg/L have been found (46).",

The resistance mechanisms developed by bacteria against these antimicrobials are also similar. All these antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis by binding to bacterial ribosomes. Macrolides can be divided into different groups according to the number of carbon atoms in their lactone ring. 14-and 15-membered ring macrolides, like erythromycin and azithromycin, have similar antibacterial properties. Sixteen-membered ring macrolides, like spiramycin, differ from 14-and 15-membered ring macrolides in their antimicrobial activity against VGS. Also lincosamides ( clindamycin) and streptogramins have some differences in their activity against bacteria, when compared to macrolides. In streptococci, there are two well-characterised macrolide resistance mechanisms: target site modifi cation and active drug effl ux. Target site modifi cation is mediated by methylases encoded by the erm (erythromycin ribosome methylation) genes or by mutations at the 23S ribosomal RNA or ribosomal proteins L4 and L22. Methylation of adenine 2058 of the peptidyl transferase loop of 23S rRNA causes resistance to macrolides as well as to lincosamides and streptogramin B antibiotics (47) . The active effl ux mechanism, encoded by the mef (macrolide effl ux) genes, is more specifi c and causes resistance only to 14-and 15-membered-ring macrolides (48) . Mutations at the macrolide-binding domains of the 23S ribosomal RNA and at the ribosomal proteins L4 and L22 lower the affi nity of macrolides to ribosomes (39) . Mutations can cause several different kinds of resistance phenotypes. Both erm and mef genes can be horizontally transferred between different streptococci (49).",

The VGS strains isolated from normal microbiota ( Table 2) are also often resistant to erythromycin, the resistance levels being at the same level as among the blood isolates (33, 50, 53) . The most common erythromycin resistance mechanism is mediated by mef(A) genes (33, 53) .

NCCLS does not yet offer telithromycin breakpoint values for other streptococci than S. pneumoniae (44) . If the estimation of telithromycin resistance is done based on the breakpoint values of S. pneumoniae, telithromycin-resistant clinical VGS strains do not exist ( Table 2 ). The binding of telithromycin to the bacterial ribosomes is much stronger than the binding of the erythromycin. This is the reason why methylation of the ribosomal RNA does not increase the MIC values as much as it does for erythromycin (56) . Neither do the Mef(A) effl ux pumps transport telithromycin out of the bacterial cell as well as they pump erythromycin. However, in streptococci, Mef(A) effl ux does elevate telithromycin MIC when compared to the strains without mef(A) gene (55) .

In some studies, resistant strains have not been found at all, but in other studies 70% of the strains have showed reduced susceptibility and 28% have been resistant (26, 52) . Also VGS strains, which have quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC of 16 mg/L have been described (26) . Resistance against quinupristin-dalfopristin combination is linked to the streptogramin A (dalfopristin) resistance, so that in order to be resistant against the antibiotic combination, a strain must be resistant to streptogramin A. Streptogramin B resistance is not necessary. Streptogramin A resistance is mediated by vga(A), vga(B), lsa and various vat genes. Thus far, these genes have been found in clinical Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains, but the presence of the genes in VGS has not been reported (57) .",

In streptococci, toposisomerase IV molecule has two subunits coded by parC and parE genes. The DNA gyrase has also two subunits GyrA and GyrB coded by corresponding genes. Topoisomerase IV is the primary target for fl uoroquinolones in VGS (61) . Mutations at the topoisomerase IV genes confer low-level resistance (MIC 4 mg/L). A combination of topoisomerase IV mutations and fl uoroquinolone effl ux mechanism is needed for high-level fl uoroquinolone resistance (MIC of 16 mg/L or more). Fluoroquinolone resistance determinants can be horizontally transferred between VGS and S. pneumoniae strains (61, (64) (65) (66) . New fl uoroquinolones levofl oxacin and moxcifl oxacin are active against Gram-positive bacteria. Levofl oxacin is active against both VGS strains of normal microbiota (33) and blood isolates (38, 41) . Only few levofl oxacin resistant strains have been found thus far (33, 38, 41) . NCCLS does not have interpretive standards for moxifl oxacin yet, and therefore resistance rates cannot be determined. However, the activity of the moxifl oxacin is somewhat better than that of levofl oxacin. MIC 90 values for moxifl oxacin and levofl oxacin are 0.25 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L, respectively (38) . In addition, all VGS strains studied for their in vitro susceptibility for moxcifl oxacin so far have had MIC of equal or less than 2 mg/L (33, 38) (Table 3 ). Ciprofl oxacin is less active than levofl oxacin or moxifl oxacin. About 8% of the VGS blood isolates are resistant to ciprofl oxacin (38).",

MICs for vancomycin are typically between 0.125 and 1 mg/L (27, (30) (31) (32) 51) and MIC 90 values between 0.5 and 1 mg/L (27, 51) . Teicoplanin, another glycopeptide antibiotic, is also active against VGS, although there are no NCCLS breakpoints available for this antibiotic (44) . MIC 90 values for teicoplanin are 0.25 mg/L or less (25, 32, 40, 51) . In general, the activity of the aminoglycosides against VGS is limited (67). Aminoglycosides like gentamycin, amikacin, streptogramin and netilmicin, are used in combination with penicillin or a cephalosporin for the treatment infective endocarditis (68) and sepsis in neutropenic patients (69) . High-level gentamicin resistance (MIC of 500 mg/L or more) to VGS is very rare. This is true with VGS isolates of blood origin (25, 32, 40) as well as with VGS strains from the normal microbiota (35) . MIC values are typically between 0.25 and 96 mg/L (25, 32, 45) and the MIC 90 values between 0.5 and 32 mg/L (32, 35) . However, few high-level aminoglycosidesresistant S. mitis strains have been detected. In these strains gentamicin MICs have been as high as 1,000 mg/L (45).",

These strains were characterized as highly resistant (MICs > 100 mg/L) to macrolides and lincomycin and they were often resistant also to tetracycline and chloramphenicol and were exclusively of T12 serotype. In 1985-1987, an increase from 1 to 17.6% in the frequency of erythromycin-resistant GAS was seen in Australia Fremantle area (83) . These strains represented different serotypes and exhibited low-level resistance to erythromycin (MICs (2-8 mg/L) and resistance to clindamycin and tetracycline was rare. In 1988-1989 sporadic isolates and family outbreaks with 22% of erythromycin-resistant GAS was reported from the Dundee area in the United Kingdom with predominance of T4M4 serotype (84) . Thereafter, in 1990 a nationwide increase of erythromycin-resistant GAS of multiclonal origin was reported from Finland, where the frequencies reached 24%, 20% and 31% among blood culture, pharyngeal and pus isolates, respectively (75) .

In Finland resistance has not been very common. 3.6% and 1.0% of the GCS have been resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively. The most common macrolide resistance mechanism has been mef(A) (123) . Similarly 3.5% and 0.3% of the GGS have been resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively. Most of these strains have had erm(TR) resistance gene and only one have had erm(B) (123) . A bit higher numbers of erythromycin resistance among GCS and GGS have been reported from Turkey. Ergen et al. (23) reported that 1.4% and 16.2% of GCS and GGS were resistant to erytromycin respectively. In Taiwan, erythromycin resistance among GCS and GGS has been more common, 41.7% and 53.3% of the GCS and GGS isolates being erythromycin resistant (124).",

            "text": "The macrolide resistance mechanism by ribosomal methylation encoded my erm genes, which was fi rst identifi ed in 1956 in Staphylococcus aureus (125) , affects macrolides, linconamides and streptogramin B (MLSb) antibiotics. The inducible and constitutive forms of MLSb resistance has been found in beta-hemolytic streptococci since the early 1970s (126) (127) (128) . The erm(B) methylase gene was the only erm gene class found in streptococci (129-131) until 1998, when the sequence of erm(TR) in S. pyogenes was published (132) . Its nucleotide sequence is 82.5% identical to staphylococcal erm(A) and 58% identical to erm(B) and therefore erm(TR) belongs to erm(A) methylase gene class (133) . The inducible or constitutive production of the methylase is dependent on the sequence of the regulatory region situated upstream from the structural methylase gene. It has been shown that in clindamycin, highly resistant mutants of S. pyogenes harbouring inducible erm(TR) and originally susceptible to clindamycin could be selected by 0.12-1 mg/L concentrations of clindamycin. Resistance was associated to structural changes in the regulatory sequence (134) . The phenotypic expression of macrolide resistance in strepto-cocci has been commonly studied by MIC determinations and induction tests including the double-disk test (erythromycin and clindamycin disks placed in vicinity on inoculated agar). Analysis of the Finnish GAS strains isolated in 1990 indicated a new erythromycin resistance phenotype with low-or moderate-level resistance (MICs 1-32 mg/L) to 14-and 15-membered macrolides only (M-phenotype). Thirty-four percent of the studied isolates represented the new phenotype (76) . Subsequently, the active effl ux mechanism causing this phenotype and the encoding mef(A) and mef(E) (macrolide effl ux) genes were characterized in S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae (48, 135, 136) and isolates with this mechanism have been found among beta-haemolytic streptococci in different parts of the world. Countries, where strains of GAS carrying mef(A) have been observed to account nowadays for the majority of macrolide-resistant isolates, include Spain (86, 137) , Germany (97) and Greece (93) , Finland (138), Taiwan (105), the United States (139), Chile (110) and Argentina (111) . Predomination of GAS strains carrying erm(A) have been reported from Russia, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Croatia (103, 140) . In GBS isolates with MLS resistance caused by erm(B) and ermA predominate in most reports in Canada and other parts of the Western Hemisphere (120, 141), France (116, 117, 142) , Spain (114, 143, 144) and Taiwan (115) . So far, GBS and GCS with the highest proportion of isolates carrying mef(A), 37% and 95%, have been reported from Taiwan and Finland, respectively (145, 146) . In addition to macrolide resistance determinants of erm(B), erm(A) and mef(A), all of which have been found from beta-haemolytic streptococci all over the world, a more rare mechanism, i.e. mutations in the S. pyogenes ribosomal protein L4 and in positions 2611 and 2058 of 23S rRNA encoding genes have been recently shown to cause resistance to macrolides. Mutations in positions 2611 and 2058 of the 23S rRNA gene cause resistance to clindamycin and streptogramin B (quinupristin), and also mutation at 2058 to telithromycin (147) (148) (149) . The presence of a putative novel effl ux system associated with erm(TR) in S. pyogenes has also recently been found (150) . Another gene, mreA, which was originally described as a macrolide effl ux gene in S. agalactiae (151) , is encoding ribofl avin kinase and is found also in erythromycin-susceptible GBS strains (152) . Strains with two different macrolide resistance mechanisms (mef and erm) within a single bacterial cell also exist among GAS and more commonly among GBS (86, 100, 116, 122, 143, 152, 153) . The phenotype of these strains is usually that determined by the erm gene.",

Isolates with mef(A) have low-or moderate-level resistance to 14-and 15-membered macrolides and isolates with either of the erm genes with constitutive expression have commonly high-level resistance to 14-, 15-and 16-membered macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B antibiotics. Inducible strains, especially those with erm(A) are often susceptible to 16-membered macrolides and clindamycin, but become highly resistant (MICs > 128 mg/L) to clindamycin and moderately or highly resistant to 16-membered macrolides after induction with subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin. Also low-level resistance to ketolides can be induced (76, 153) . Beta-haemolytic streptococci with inducible erm(B) are more commonly associated to highlevel resistance to MLSb-antibiotics than isolates with inducible erm(A) gene (122, 153) . In epidemiological studies the distribution of the resistance mechanisms, the expression of erm(A) has more often been inducible and that of erm(B) has more often been constitutive in GAS, but among GBS constitutive erm(A) and inducible erm(B) are also rather common (122, 144) , e.g. in Turkey, isolates with inducible erm(B) accounted for majority of macrolide resistance in GBS (122) .",

In earlier studies conjugative plasmids with the erythromycin resistance determinants were found from group A, B, C and G streptococci and they were shown to transfer by conjugation between streptococcal species (154) and among GAS also by transduction (155, 156) . However, most antibiotic resistance genes are nowadays thought to be chromosomal in streptococci, and betahaemolytic streptococci belonging to groups A, B, C and G have been shown to transfer their chromosomal macrolide resistance determinants by conjugation (152, (157) (158) (159) . A composite chromosomal conjugative element Tn3701, encoding resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline has been described in GAS (160) . Within this element the resistance genes are carried by a Tn916-like transposon. The presence of Tn916-Tn1545-like conjugative transposons carrying erm(B) and tet(M) has been verifi ed later in GAS in other studies (161, 162) and an association of chromosomal erm(A) with tet(O) has been noted in some strains of GAS (161) . An unusual chimeric genetic element containing DNA identical to Tn1207.1, a transposable element carrying mef(A) in macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae, has also been found in different GAS strains. The mechanism of horizontal transfer in these strains was suggested to be transduction (163) . Furthermore, analysis of the genetic environments of the mef(A) and erm(B) genes by Southern blot experiments have indicated a remarkable heterogeneity of genetic elements carrying these genes, especially erm(B), suggesting that different mobile elements can be recruited into the chromosomes of the circulating GAS population and that genetic rearrangement may also occur after a strain has acquired the resistance determinant (162).",

            "text": "A large variety of clones of GAS are mediating macrolide resistance (105, 162, 164, 165) . Increased resistance rates may be caused by clonal spread of resistant strains and by horizontal transfer of resistance determinants among the circulating microbial population. Macrolide-resistant GAS of the same clone have been found from different countries and even different continents (164) and the same clones have been found among susceptible isolates, but in general the heterogeneity of GAS clones seems to be lower among resistant than susceptible isolates (162, 164, 165) . Single clones of GAS with a macrolide-resistant determinant may become regionally or nationally widely predominant or cause outbreaks (100, 108, 109, 166) . For example, in Finland, 82% of isolates of erythromycin-resistant GAS collected all over the country in 1994 expressed the M-phenotype; although multiple clones were found among these isolates, increased regional resistance rates were clearly associated to a clone of T4M4 serotype with mef(A) (138, 158) . In Taiwan, 33% of the erythromycin-resistant GAS collected in 1992-1995 and 1997-1998 carried constitutive erm(B) and were of one clonal origin. Sixty-four percent carried mef(A) of which only 23% were of one clonal origin and 16 other clones were found among the rest of these isolates (105) . In Russia, 87% of erythromycin-resistant GAS collected in 2000-2001 carried inducible erm(TR) and 86% of these were of one clonal origin (103) . In the United States, Pittsburgh, isolates carrying mef(A) of an emm6 (M6 serotype) clone that caused an epidemic among school children in 2001 were not at all found in the region within a two-month period in April-May in 2002, when the resistance rate was again at a high level (35% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin); this time an emm75 (M75 serotype) clone predominated (109, 139) . In Italy, Cresti et al. found that a steady increase of erythromycin-resistant GAS from 9% in 1992 to 53% in 1997 in an area in central Italy was caused by an increase of the proportion of strains carrying inducible and constitutive erm(B) and erm(TR) determinants. These strains were of multiclonal origin. Correlation of the erythromycin-resistant GAS clones to the heterogeneity of genetic elements carrying the erm(B) indicated identical genetic environments of erm(B) in clonally unrelated strains, but on the other hand also indicated considerable diversity of these genetic elements both among clonally unrelated and within clonally identical strains (162) . The increase of resistance, therefore, includes a complex genetic interaction within circulating streptococcal population and maybe between streptococci and other species (167) . Macrolide consumption and different immunity status and other host factors of populations are also possible factors that contribute to this interplay and spread of resistance determinants and resistant clones (168-170).",

The etiology of infective endocarditis varies according to the age of patients and the clinical nature of the disease (173) (174) (175) (176) . VGS cause about 28% of all cases (173, 176) . The proportion of VGS among native valve endocarditis varies between 11 and 43% (174, 177) , and VGS are the most common cause of late prosthetic-valve endocarditis (174, 175, 177) . Several different VGS species have been reported to cause endocarditis, S. sanguis (68, 174) , S. mitis, S. oralis and S. gordonii (177) being the most common species isolated from blood or infected valves. Among intravenous drug abusers, the VGS do not have as important a role as they have in general (174) . In the point of view of the treatment and prophylaxis, penicillin resistance is a cause of concern. The treatment recommendation for infective endocarditis caused by penicillin-susceptible (MIC \u22640.1 mg/L) streptococci is intravenous penicillin G for 4 weeks combined with intravenous gentamicin for 2 weeks (68, 178, 179) . Instead of penicillin, ceftriaxone also can be used in combination with gentamicin (68, 178) . Streptococcal strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MIC > 0.1 mg/L) can be treated with penicillin G in combination with gentamicin. However, higher dose of penicillin and longer treatment times (4-6 weeks) are recommended (68, 178, 179) . Low-level penicillin resistance among VGS isolated either from blood samples or normal microbiota is quite common. From 17 up to 56% show penicillin MIC of 0.125 mg/L or higher (Table 1) . Although, there is not much data available in the literature, this low-level penicillin resistance seem not to be a significant clinical problem. Penicillin and aminoglycoside, most often penicillin and gentamicin, combination has synergistic activity against VGS (178) . In the literature there are a few documented cases where patients with endocarditis caused by intermediately penicillin-resistant streptococcus were treated successfully with penicillin-gentamicin or in one case a penicillin-streptomycin combination (180) . Also penicillin therapy alone followed by cephalotin and vancomycin therapies has been successfully used for treatment of endocarditis caused by low-level penicillin resistant streptococci (180) .",

Among VGS from endocarditis patients, high-level penicillin resistance is rare. Only a few strains with MICs higher than or equal to 4 mg/L, have been reported (40, (179) (180) (181) (182) (183) . Decreased susceptibility among VGS strains from normal microbiota is common. In the future, penicillin nonsusceptible streptococci will more often cause endocarditis infections, and it is also likely that high-level penicillin resistance will increase. This is a challenge because optimal treatment regimens have not yet been determined in endocarditis caused by highly penicillin-resistant VGS. Thus far, all VGS strains tested have been susceptible to vancomycin (68, 178) . There are reports where vancomycin alone (182) and vancomycin, ceftriaxone and gentamicin in combination (183) has been successfully used for treatment of endocarditis caused by highly resistant streptococci. However, some reports show that treatment of endocarditis caused by highly penicillin-resistant streptococci can be diffi cult. In one study, neither vancomycin treatment alone, nor a cefotaxime-gentamicin combination, was enough to completely cure endocarditis caused by a highly penicillin-resistant S. mitis strain in a human immunodefi ciency virus positive individual (181) . Also the vancomycin-gentamicin combination failed to cure endocarditis caused by highly penicillin-resistant S. sanguis in a 65-year-old woman with multiple medical problems (180) . This indicates that other antibiotic regimens may be needed. Possible new candidates are levofl oxacin, moxifl oxacin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid. Resistance against these antibiotics is rare. However, the usage of these agents may select resistant strains especially among streptococci in the normal microbiota. For example, point mutations causing resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin combination have already been described in other bacterial species (58) . The same is true with fl uoroquinolones, where point mutations are able to cause low-level resistance among streptococci (38, 61, 64) . Linezolid-resistant strains are very rare, although one strain with linezolid resistance (MIC 4 mg/L) has been reported (38) . Oxazolinones are bacteriostatic antibiotics and in that sense their usage for treatment of infective endocarditis may be compromised (70) . However, linezolid has been successfully used for treatments of endocarditis caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (71, 184) . At the moment there is no information of the effi cacy of linezolid in the treatment of endocarditis caused by VGS.",

Clindamycin, which is recommended for prophylaxis for patients allergic to penicillin (68) , might be, from the point of view of resistance, a better choice at the moment (Table 2) . However, use of macrolides can also select clindamycinresistant strains among normal microbiota streptococci, because Erm(B) methylase is able to cause both macrolide and clindamycin resistance. So, it is possible that in the future the clindamycin resistance rates are also higher than now. Telithromycin is very active against VGS strains of normal microbiota. erm(B) and mef(A) resistance genes do not mediate telithromycin resistance among VGS (33) , although the presence of mef(A) gene in streptococci is increasing the MIC values (55) .

There have been changes in the aetiology of bacteremia in febrile neutropenic patients. Earlier, Gram-negative bacteria were the most common cause. Nowadays, up to 70% of the bacteremia in neutropenic patients is caused by Grampositive bacteria (185) (186) (187) (188) . Possible reasons for this shift in the aetiology are the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, increased use of intravenous catheters and aggressive chemotherapies with prolonged neutropenia and mucositis (186, 187, 189, 190) . VGS are an important cause of bacteremia among neutropenic patients. Depending on the study the proportion of VGS as a cause of bacteremia ranges between 3 and 30% (31, 187, 188, (191) (192) (193) . S. mitis followed by S. oralis or S. sanguis are the most commonly isolated species (24, 188, (193) (194) (195) . Bacteremias caused by VGS strains originate from the oral mucosa (42, 196) . Predisposing factors for VGS infections are severe and prolonged neutropenia, prophylactic antibiotic treatments with quinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, mucositis and treatment of chemotherapyinduced gastritis with antacids or histamine type 2 antagonists (189, 195) . VGS infections can be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Range of overall mortality of VGS bacteremia is between 6 and 18%, but this does not differ from the mortality rate of bacteremia caused by other bacteria (185, 194, 197) . VGS infections can be rather asymptomatic, fever being the most common symptom (189, 194, (197) (198) (199) . 4 to 26% of the patients with VGS infections develop serious complications, like septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or both (31, 189, 194, 197, 198) . Mortality among patients that develop ARDS is high, up to 60-100% (31, 189, 194) . Adequate empirical antimicrobial therapy of neutropenic patients with fever is essential, because infection may progress rapidly. The empirical therapy should cover both Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria (200) (201) (202) . Especially important is that empirical treatment cover VGS and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (201) . Recommendation for empirical therapy depend on the risk of the of neutropenic patients to develop serious complication during the febrile episode (200) . Empiric antibacterial treatment for low-risk neutropenic patients relies on ciprofl oxacin or levofl oxacin with or without amoxicillin-clavulanate (200) (201) (202) . In addition, fl uoroquinolones with clindamycin has been suggested (200) . Monotherapy with new fl uoroquinolones, which show better activity against Gram-positive bacteria is not yet suggested for empirical treatment of low-risk neutropenic patients (200) . Empirical antibacterial treatment of high-risk neutropenic patient relies on broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics. Third-(ceftazidime) or fourth-(cefepime) generation cephalosporin alone or together with an aminoglycoside, or carbapenem either alone or in combination with aminoglycoside are the fi rst choice of drugs (201, 202) . Also, piperacillin-tazobactam either alone or in combination with aminoglycoside is recommended (185) . Glycopeptides should be avoided in order to reduce the development of glycopeptide-resistant bacterial strains (185) . It has also shown that empirical addition of vancomycin to the therapy would not give any benefi t, when compared to piperacillin-tazobactam therapy (203) .",

            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from neutropenic patients have been widely studied. These studies indicate that low-level penicillin resistance is common. 21 to 39% of the VGS strains isolated from neutropenic patients present reduced susceptibility against penicillin (28, 30, 36, 42, 51) . However, as much as 57% of the VGS strains have been reported to be non-susceptible to penicillin (204) . Highly resistant VGS strains (MIC\u22654 mg/L) can also be found, the resistance rates varying typically between 2 and 24% (30, 36, 42, 51) . Penicillin and especially highly penicillin resistant VGS strains are often resistant to cephalosporins and also express reduced susceptibility to imipenem (30) . In these cases ceftazidime is not active (29, 30) . Despite the high rates of penicillin resistance among VGS strains, penicillin resistance has not been associated with the development of severe complications, like ARDS (30, 31, 189) or the overall mortality (30) . However, there are few reports, which indicate that increasing rates of penicillin resistance might cause problems in the empirical treatment of neutropenic patients with VGS bacteremia. For example, Marron et al. (30) reported a breakthrough bacteraemia of ceftazidime-resistant VGS strains among patients receiving ceftazidime treatment. Similarly, Elting et al. (188) reported that neutropenic patients with VGS infections who did not receive vancomycin in the initial empiric therapy, died more often than-patients who received initial vancomycin therapy. Also in the same study it was shown that patients with penicillin-susceptible VGS infections responded to the initial therapy better than patients with penicillin-resistant VGS, although the fi nal outcome was not affected by penicillin resistance (188) .",

            "text": "The importance of identifying antimicrobial resistance in beta-hemolytic streptococci is dependent upon whether these antimicrobials are used for treatment and whether the in vitro resistance leads to clinical treatment failure. Penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment of streptococcal infections and macrolides are considered as an alternative treatment for penicillin-allergic patients. In the treatment of pharyngitis caused by GAS, it has been shown that the eradication rate is lower (38-60%) when 14-and 15-membered macrolides are used against macrolide-resistant strains in comparison to the eradication rate (80-92%) when these agents are used against macrolide-susceptible organisms (99, 210, 211) . The use of a macrolides for the treatment of macrolide-resistant GAS pharyngitis is also associated with a signifi cantly lower clinical cure rate compared to that achieved with amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate or cefaclor (211) . In addition, it has been shown that regardless of the macrolide resistance mechanism and of epidemiological origin, the erythromycin-resistant isolates harbour the prtF1 gene, more often, encoding a protein that enhances the ability to enter respiratory cells, than erythromycin-susceptible organisms (212) . Macrolideresistant GAS strains are so far mostly susceptible to telithromycin, which is a better choice than macrolides. However, few resistant strains exist and the knowledge of resistance and resistance mechanisms is important. The same is true with clindamycin. Use of clindamycin against an erythromycin-resistant isolate requires knowledge of the result of both the susceptibity testing and the determination of the macrolide resistance phenotype for a given isolate, because clindamycin should not be used against isolates with the MLSb-phenotype (134) . Since we lack many alternatives for macrolides, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, especially GAS and GBS, may cause serious infections and non-suppurative sequelae, limiting the use of macrolides should be encouraged (213, 214) . The selective pressure caused by the amount of macrolides used in the community has been shown to correlate to the level of macrolide resistance in GAS in the community (168) (169) (170) 215) and reduction of use of these agents has been shown to lead to reduction of macrolide resistance (213, 214) .",

Among the reasons for the continuing susceptibility to penicillin in GAS, the following have been suggested: the pathogens ineffi cient mechanisms for genetic transfer or barriers to DNA uptake and replication and the fi ndings that low-affi nity PBPs expressed by penicillin-resistant laboratory mutants of GAS have a potentially defective performance in the cell-wall biosynthesis, thus decreasing the viability of the penicillin-resistant organism (28, 217) .",
