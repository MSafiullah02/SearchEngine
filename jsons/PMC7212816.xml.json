The Chinese government subsequently quarantined the greater Wuhan area on January 23, 2020, to prevent COVID-19 spread [2].",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began making recommendations based on the scientific knowledge of the situation to limit social contacts, encourage wise use of medical supplies including masks, and assure the public about the reliability of the food and consumable goods supplies [6]. However, even after these recommendations, there were reports of college students waiting in long lines at bars to celebrate their campuses closing [7], people buying medical-grade masks [8], and people hoarding everything from toilet paper to eggs and milk [9], even as the President sought to reassure the public that the supply of food and goods was secure [10].",

In the face of the current pandemic, this requires the public to understand and trust those who are making recommendations to limit exposure and the spread of the illness. The deficit model of PUS posits that a lack of support for science (and a subsequent rejection of recommendations) is due to a lack of understanding about science, and if scientists can find a way to fill this knowledge deficit, then support for science will increase. A more contemporary view of PUS is that the public\u2019s knowledge is not deficient, but rather there is a deficit in trust of science and in scientific experts specifically. Because of an increasing lack of trust in these institutions, Solomon [11] observed that there is an increased personal rejection of science, which then leads to lower levels of scientific literacy and understanding of science. Low literacy and understanding may influence people to not follow recommendations for addressing science-based problems as is evident with the current pandemic.",

Results are mixed as to whether increased knowledge leads to positive attitudes (variously described as trust, support, confidence, and support for funding) about science. Allum et al [12] observed a small positive correlation between knowledge about science and positive attitudes about science, and Miller [13] reports that there is public support for science even in the face of a scientific literacy rate of 20%. The public\u2019s support for science is necessary when addressing many important social issues, including an immediate need for the public to understand and trust the science about the novel coronavirus pandemic currently plaguing the world. If the public does not trust the underlying science about these issues and does not trust institutions that are tasked with managing this threat, it will be difficult to count on public support for policies to address these issues.",

This study essentially replicates questions about knowledge from that study while asking about more specific behaviors. The sample was drawn from an online work platform (Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk) to determine the level of knowledge about COVID-19 and characteristics that influence knowledge and behaviors toward COVID-19. This is among one of the first attempts to investigate determinants of knowledge and behaviors in the public related to COVID-19 in the United States.",

The first part asked participants basic demographic characteristics including year of birth, which was used to determine age and generational membership (eg, baby boomers, Gen X [18]); education; sex; income; race; political party affiliation; and place of residence (US state). Age was included to determine differences in knowledge and behavioral patterns based on age. Some reports in the United States essentially callout different age groups for ignoring public health recommendations [7,19]. In addition, there are well described patterns of health literacy based on education level [20] and race [21], which may not be present in a homogeneous society such as China. Political party identification is associated with many attitudes and behaviors in the United States related to science and science-based recommendations [22,23]. Leaders from both major parties in the United States have reacted differently to the COVID-19 pandemic, likely influencing those who follow them [24,25]. No personal identifiers were collected.",

Three additional questions were asked to determine participation in specific behaviors related to recommendations from the CDC and the NIH, including whether participants had spent more money than usual in the last 2 weeks on cleaning supplies, personal hygiene products, and food (a proxy measure of hoarding); whether they had gone to any place in the last 5 days where there were more than 50 people present (contradicting CDC recommendations to avoid such gatherings); and if they had worn a mask when leaving the home in the last 5 days (contradicting CDC, NIH, and health care official guidance).",

An analysis of variance was used to determine differences in mean knowledge scores among groups based on education, race, income, political party, and generational age groups (eg, baby boomers, Gen X; Table 2). A multivariable linear regression was used to determine which demographic characteristics influenced knowledge scores, and a binomial logistic regression was used to determine which characteristics influence participating in hoarding behavior, attending large group events, and using masks (Table 3).

In China, only 3.6% of people reported going to crowded places in the previous 2 weeks [14]. It is possible that the coordinated effort and unchecked authority of the Chinese government to lockdown provinces provided most of the motivation for Chinese citizens to obey these mandates. To date, there has not been a coordinated effort by the US government to lockdown the nation. There is some debate whether the federal government even has constitutional authority, so individual states are left to make decisions about \u201cshelter at home\u201d policies and similar efforts. As of this writing, California, Illinois, New York, Washington, Michigan, Massachusetts, Indiana, Oregon, and West Virginia have issued stay-at-home orders; however, no state had issued a stay-at-home order as of the date of the survey, March 17, 2020. California was the first state in the nation to issue the order on March 19, 2020. Although many citizens all over the country could have anticipated some of these stay-at-home policies, which might have led them to change their purchasing behaviors, it is not possible with this data to determine if there were differences in purchasing behavior based on the presence of a stay-at-home order. With about 1 in 3 US citizens ordered to stay home, it is likely in the coming weeks that fewer people will report attending large gatherings.

However, it is probably more likely that masks could not be found in the United States because of a lack of supply combined with hoarding behavior [10]. Still, 24% of people reported using masks, indicating that a large section of the US public chose to ignore recommendations. It is important to note that the debate on masks has changed even since this survey was conducted, and the nationwide recommendation now is to wear masks, which has been made based on the understanding that many people with mild symptoms may not even know they are infected with COVID-19. Mask use could prevent infecting others by asymptomatic carriers.

To summarize, Republicans had lower knowledge and had higher odds of attending large gatherings and wearing masks in public compared to Democrats and independents. These behaviors directly contradict recommendations by both the CDC and NIH. In the United States, there is a widening gap in trust in science and science-based recommendations based on political party [22], which may contribute to the observation here that Republicans are more likely to ignore recommendations about the COVID-19 response. In addition, the results reported here suggest that there continues to be political divisions over the role of scientific experts in policy matters [23]. That is, Democrats want expert involvement and believe scientists should be involved in policy recommendations. Conversely, Republicans believe scientists should stay out of policy debates. These attitudes may be reflected in the results that Republicans have lower knowledge about COVID-19 and have higher odds of participating in behaviors that are not recommended by authorities to stem the tide of the current pandemic.

For example, although the current consensus is that eating wild animals will not transmit the disease, living and working in close proximity to animals clearly influenced this outbreak and could influence future outbreaks. As such, the argument for banning wet markets in China is gaining momentum, but knowledge about proximity to animals, as opposed to using them as a food source, might be conflated. Second, knowledge regarding who is most at risk for COVID-19 may change as the pandemic proceeds, as well as with experiences in different countries. For instance, fewer younger people in China were infected, while in the United States, a different pattern appears to be emerging [29]. Third, this was a convenience sample of US residents from every state in the country, but people were able to self-select based on their interest and experience with the topic. It is possible that sample demographics may not completely represent the US public. Fourth, although the survey questions were not able to be validated given the fast-moving nature of the pandemic response in the United States, the questions do have face value in the context of the situation at the time the survey was conducted. However, the first question about purchasing behavior (cleaning supplies, hygiene products, and food) might be better asked as three separate questions. Fifth, the theory that PUS and knowledge about science drives behavior is just one theory to study behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs. Future studies could incorporate models based on the theory of planned behavior, social cognitive theory, or even health belief models with questions devised to elicit responses about how desires, needs, and beliefs drive the types of behaviors studied here.",

These differences appear to have prevented a coordinated effort at slowing the spread of the pandemic in the United States in the early days of the pandemic. Ignoring official recommendations for crowd avoidance, the use of medical supplies, and purchasing behaviors that signal hoarding of goods, does not bode well for efforts to contain the spread of the virus and limit exposure to vulnerable populations. Without a coordinated national response, it is likely that the United States will experience a longer, more drawn out battle than if such coordination would occur. In addition, it is important for future waves of COVID-19 that we consider implementing specific policies and programs to target groups of people who have been unequally affected by the pandemic. Now is the time for policy makers to address the structural issues in many urban areas that adversely affect minority health care, especially when we observe disparities in mortality based on race. Now is the time for policy makers to ensure that access to care, especially specialized care, in rural areas does not hamper the response to COVID-19, which is likely to hit rural areas in the next wave. Finally, it is time for policy makers to reverse the decades long decimation of public health funding and infrastructure that has left the United States so vulnerable to the ravages of this pandemic.",
