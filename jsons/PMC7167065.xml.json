            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global health problem [Wantuck et al., 2014]. There are about 170 million infected individuals all over the world, representing about 3% of total population [Khattab et al., 2011]. Most of HCV patients are chronically infected and are at risk of development of HCV\u2010related complications such as hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [Kamal and Nasser, 2008]. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Egypt is extremely high, affecting about 15% of the population [Guerra et al., 2012]. Six major genotypes and a series of subtypes of HCV have been identified [Simmonds et al., 2005]. The most prevalent HCV genotype in Egyptian patients is Genotype\u20104a (up to 91%) [Ray et al., 2000]. HCV Genotype is one of the most important predictors of response to HCV standard therapy [Schaefer et al., 2004].",

            "text": "Until 2011, pegylated interferon\u2010alfa plus ribavirin combination was the standard of care therapy for HCV infection [Manns et al., 2001]. The rate of sustained virological response (SVR) achieved as a result of this dual therapy (DT) for HCV genotypes 2 and 3 was between 70% and 80%, and for HCV genotypes 1 and 4 was between 45% and 60% [Muir et al., 2004]. The standard duration of PegIFN and RBV therapy has been 48 weeks, except in slow responders (detectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks but undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after treatment), in whom increasing the dual therapy duration to 72 weeks may obtain higher rates of SVR [Pearlman et al., 2007]. After 2011, new oral compounds known as directly acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have been introduced in the treatment of chronic HCV infection with SVR rates of between 90% and 100%; explaining that we might soon have the ability to cure all patients with HCV (treatment\u2010na\u00efve, relapsed patients on previous dual therapy and resistant patients) [Kowdley et al., 2014]. Since 2011, telaprevir and boceprevir were approved as first generation NS3 protease inhibitors as a new standard line of therapy for genotype 1 HCV patients in addition to standard classical therapy, but relapsers and previous non\u2010responders to dual therapy have shown low SVR rates to this new therapy in addition to observation of many side effects, especially in patients with advanced grade of hepatic fibrosis [Aghemo et al., 2013]. Since 2014, FDA has approved sofosbuvir (SOF), simeprevir (SIM), and daclatasvir (DCV) as new generations of DAAs of higher SVR rates with fewer side effects and shorter duration of treatment [Abdel\u2010Razek and Waked, 2015]. The previously mentioned DAAs can be used in combination with or without PegIFN and/or RBV combination with different duration of therapy based on the used combination. The optimal regimen in IFN eligible patients is a combination of Peg\u2010IFN and RBV plus SOF, SIM and DCV for 12 weeks but in IFN ineligible patients, the best treatment course is a combination of SOF/RBV for 24 weeks, or a combination of SOF\u2010SIM or SOF\u2010DCV with or without RBV for 12 weeks [Mohamed et al., 2015]. Because of HCV exists as a heterogeneous pool of genetic variants within the infected patient before treatment and the expanded use of DAAs in the near future anticipates that a part of patients will develop resistance and fail to achieve SVR [Ahmed and Felmlee, 2015]. So, there is a need to develop anti\u2010HCV agents, which are more efficacious and cost effective with lower resistance and minimal adverse effects.",

Hydroxychloroquine was found to have immunomodulatory properties that have enabled its use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis [Wozniacka et al., 2007]. In addition to its antimalarial effect and immunosuppressive activity, HCQ has shown some biochemical characters that rendered it to be active against some viral infections [Savarino et al., 2006]. It has been found that HCQ exerts direct antiviral effects against several viruses including members of the flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses through inhibition of pH\u2010dependent steps of their replication inside host cells [Savarino et al., 2003]. Moreover, it has been reported that HCQ has antiviral actions against 12 human pathogenic viruses including hepatitis A, B, and C viruses [Chandramohan et al., 2007]. Hydroxychloroquine was found to block the entire replication cycle of hepatitis A virus through inhibition of its uncoating step inside hepatocytes [Bishop, 1998]. Furthermore, it has been suggested in several in vitro studies that HCV replication uses process involving cellular autophagic proteolysis which can be inhibited by HCQ [Meertens et al., 2006].",

            "text": "Response to treatment of genotype\u20104 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a matter of debate [Manns et al., 2001]. Until 2011, the combination of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin was the cornerstone of treatment and the standard of care for all HCV genotypes on the basis of results of multiple\u2010randomized controlled trials. HCV genotype\u20104 has a poor response to the dual therapy of peg\u2010IFN/RBV with sustained virological response rates (SVR) ranging between 40% and 60% [Kamal and Nasser, 2008]. In the past years, optimization of interferon alfa\u2010based therapy for CHC was the new strategy in HCV\u2010related medical studies to increase SVR rates [Zeuzem, 2008]. Over the last 3 years, a combination of direct\u2010acting antiviral agents (DAAs) involving NS3\u20104A inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, and NS5B nucleoside or non\u2010nucleoside inhibitors has shown their strong efficacy to achieve SVR rates >90% against most HCV genotypes [Gutierrez et al., 2015]. Although the first generation of DAAs has increased the rate of SVR when administered in combination with pegylated interferon, but many side\u2010effects remained. The approval of next\u2010generation DAAs such as sofosbuvir, simeprevir, and daclatasvir to be in the antiviral therapy of HCV has led to interferon\u2010free regimens in the clinical application [Douam et al., 2016]. Because of most of these drugs have a low barrier to resistance, multiple obstacles will likely appear in the future against the use of them. Furthermore, natural polymorphisms in certain HCV genotypes and subtypes have been reported in addition to resistant mutations to multiple DAAs have already been characterized in NS3\u20104A, NS5A, and NS5B [Sarrazin, 2016]. The high cost of these medications especially in low\u2010income countries such as Egypt with a high prevalence of HCV, have urged a growing need for developing new, more effective antiviral agents with fewer side effects and can be combined with the standard of care for successful HCV treatment.",

            "text": "We aimed in this study to investigate the efficacy of adding hydroxychloroquine to pegylated interferon and ribavirin on EVR in chronic hepatitis C Egyptian patients. The rationale for choosing EVR to be the primary efficacy parameter was based on what have been documented about the predictive value of EVR toward the chances of achieving SVR. It has been illustrated that patients without an EVR have a very little chance of achieving SVR [Ferenci et al., 2005]. Similarly, EVR was an excellent predictor of treatment outcome, whereas the absence of EVR was associated with very low chance (0\u20133%) of achieving SVR in Egyptian patients [Elefsiniotis et al., 2009]. In the present study, the extent of EVR was significantly more in patients received triple therapy of peginterferon alfa\u20102a, ribavirin, and hydroxychloroquine than those received the standard of care [54/60 (90%) vs. 43/60 (71.7%); P = 0.011]. Also, the extent of virologic failure was significantly lower in hydroxychloroquine patients compared with standard of care patients [[6/60 (10%) vs. 17/60 (28.3%)]. This improvement in EVR in HCQ\u2010treated group was assumed to be due to the reported antiviral activity of HCQ that augmented the inhibitory action of the standard of care on hepatitis C viral replication in hepatocytes. The antiviral activity of HCQ was attributed to the fact that HCQ is a weak base that has a greater tendency to be captured by acidic organelles and accumulated inside them resulting in an increase of their pH [Savarino et al., 2003]. The accumulation of HCQ within the acidic organelles, including endosomes, lysosomes, and Golgi vesicle and thereby the increase of their pH is the main cause of HCQ antiviral activity [Sundelin and Terman, 2002]. For explanation, HCV entry into the host cell is a pH\u2010dependent process which requires a low pH to perform some conformational changes that are essential for fusion, penetration, uncoating, and endocytosis which occurs within the endosomal pathway [Ashfaq et al., 2011]. Moreover, HCQ might interfere with post\u2010translational modifications of HCV envelope glycoproteins through inhibition of proteases and glycosyltransferases activities within the trans\u2010Golgi network and endoplasmic vesicles which are responsible for those modifications [Rolain et al., 2007]. As these enzymes require a low pH for their activity, HCQ might therefore lead to decreased viral infectivity through impaired envelope maturation [Randolph et al., 1990]. Based on the previous explanation, it could be suggested that HCQ increased EVR by suppression of HCV replication inside hepatocytes.",

Moreover, HCQ was also found to be active against hepatitis A and hepatitis B viruses [Offensperger et al., 1991]. It is important to notify that HCQ not only has the potential to inhibit the replication of hepatic viruses but also it has antiviral activity against all viruses of low pH\u2010dependent entry and replication [Thom\u00e9 et al., 2013]. For instance, it has been reported that lysosomotropic activity of HCQ exert direct antiviral effects against several RNA viruses including coronaviruses, influenza A virus, flaviviruses, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [Savarino et al., 2006].",

Another limitation is the lack of this study for assessment of rapid virological response (RVR) defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 of treatment although RVR is a strong predictor of SVR [positive predictive value (PPV) >96%] and failure to achieve EVR was a strong predictor of non SVR [negative predictive value (NPV) >70%], independent of patient's pretreatment (9).
