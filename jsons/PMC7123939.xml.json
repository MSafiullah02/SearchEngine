According to the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC) of 2005, the spectrum of sepsis can be divided into systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock [1]. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome describes an inflammatory state with immune activation that may have a variety of underlying etiologies. It is defined by two of the following four criteria (Fig. 14.1). Sepsis is defined by SIRS with a suspected or proven underlying infection. The diagnosis can be escalated to severe sepsis if the patient has developed cardiovascular organ dysfunction or acute respiratory distress syndrome or two other organ system involvements. In cases where cardiovascular dysfunction is refractory to adequate fluid resuscitation, the diagnosis can be further escalated to septic shock.",

Importantly, the diagnosis of sepsis does not require a proven infection, but rather can be made with clinical suspicion for infection alone.

Although some retrospective analyses have analyzed potential benefits for different types of resuscitation fluids, strong prospective data do not exist to favor the use of crystalloid over colloid or balanced over unbalanced fluids in this population [13\u201315]. The use of hydroxyethyl starches (HESs) is not recommended [16]. Rapid fluid resuscitation typically requires two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters and should not rely solely on surgically implanted central venous catheters; in cases where difficult peripheral venous access delays fluid resuscitation, physicians should establish intraosseous access [17].",

Resolution of hypotension, tachycardia, and impaired perfusion can be used to guide volume of resuscitation fluids [17]. Low central venous pressure (CVP) may be used to titrate volume resuscitation, but absolute measurements vary from child to child and thus require frequent or continuous measurement to establish patient-specific trends. Care should be taken when interpreting central venous pressure, as central venous pressure is related to both intravascular volume and right and left ventricular compliance. Further, children in septic shock with elevated central venous pressure frequently have diastolic dysfunction and left heart strain, which are associated with increased mortality [18\u201320]. Prediction of fluid responsiveness using other hemodynamic variables is an area of active interest, with some data supporting the use of aortic flow velocity and arterial pulse pressure variability with respiration [21, 22].",

In the general pediatric ICU population, thresholds of >7 g/dL and > 10 g/dL have been shown to be equally safe, with the advantage that a threshold of >7 g/dL resulted in fewer blood transfusions and potentially fewer nosocomial infections [23]. These results have been repeated in children with sepsis who have completed the resuscitation and stabilization period although sample size limitations precluded an appropriate analysis of mortality differences [24, 25]. However, the optimal transfusion threshold for patients with active septic shock has not been determined, and as of 2014, the majority of English- and French-speaking pediatric intensivists appear to use a transfusion threshold of >10 g/dL for children in active septic shock [26]. In a retrospective propensity score-adjusted study, more frequent RBC transfusions were associated with mortality in septic adults with hematologic malignancies, although whether this may be due to transfusion effects or underlying coagulopathy or hematologic failure is unknown [27]. As immunocompromised patients may have ineffective erythropoiesis and/or increased immune and nonimmune erythrocyte destruction, close attention to hemoglobin levels is warranted in sepsis [28].",

Hence, early use of noninvasive supplemental oxygen, including nasal cannula, face mask, and non-rebreather masks, is warranted for pediatric immunocompromised patients with sepsis. Although pediatric data are lacking, among immunocompromised adults with infection-related acute respiratory failure, early application of noninvasive oxygen support can reduce progression to invasive mechanical ventilation [29, 30]. Data supporting the optimal timing of transition to noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, and/or invasive mechanical ventilation, are limited in pediatrics. However, adult data suggest that patients who fail noninvasive ventilation should transition rapidly to endotracheal intubation, as prolonged failure of noninvasive ventilation is strongly associated with mortality [31]. A recent international sepsis point prevalence study identified that more than two-thirds of pediatric HCT patients with sepsis require endotracheal intubation during their course of sepsis [32]. Therefore we advocate that aggressive oxygenation support be offered to all critically ill immunocompromised children with sepsis.",

Some patients may also have myocardial depression in the face of sepsis-induced hypercytokinemia [33, 34]. The choice of vasoactive infusions depends largely on clinical assessment of warm (vasodilatory) vs. cold (vasoconstricted) shock. Two separate double-blind, randomized controlled trial of dopamine vs. epinephrine for pediatric cold septic shock demonstrated clinical superiority of epinephrine over dopamine for multiple endpoints [35, 36]. Several other larger studies of adult and pediatric septic shock have demonstrated superiority of norepinephrine over dopamine for warm shock as well [37, 38]. Pediatric oncology patients with anthracycline exposure of any amount, particularly >300 mg/m2 but even as low as 50 mg/m2, are at increased risk for cardiotoxicity and may require significant attention to cardiopulmonary dynamics [39]. Additional vasoactive infusions including milrinone, terlipressin, levosimendan, and other agents may be required for refractory shock, although data are insufficient to recommend specific use in the pediatric immunocompromised population.",

By reducing work of breathing and off-loading the left ventricle, invasive mechanical ventilation can reduce metabolic expenditure by up to 30% [42, 43]. Studies of timing of mechanical ventilation in adult sepsis suggest that delayed intubation may be associated with adverse outcomes and some patients may experience cardiopulmonary arrest due to decreased preload associated with vasodilation from sedation required for the procedure [44]. Of note, some data suggest that the use of etomidate during endotracheal intubation, particularly in patients receiving exogenous hydrocortisone, is associated with worse outcomes, potentially due to medication-induced adrenal suppression [45, 46].",

Several studies support the use of mixed venous oxygenation saturation measurements in the management of shock, wherein abnormally large arterial-venous saturation differential can suggest inadequate oxygenation and/or mitochondrial dysfunction prior to the rise of traditional markers such as serum lactate [52\u201356]. Data supporting the routine use of transpulmonary thermodilution are insufficient at this time [57]. Continuous blood pressure transducing with arterial lines allows monitoring of arterial blood pressure and may be useful for rapid changes in hemodynamics.

A meta-analysis assessing the utility of paired central and peripheral blood cultures in both pediatric and adult cancer patients with suspected bloodstream infections demonstrated positive paired blood cultures in 17% of cases; 13% were only identified by peripheral blood and 28% only by central venous line samples [58]. Furthermore, a single center study of pediatric cancer patients demonstrated cases in which peripheral blood cultures were positive though central cultures were not. In this study of the 228 episodes of bacteremia, the peripheral blood culture was the only positive culture in 28 cases (12%). Therefore, obtaining both peripheral blood and central cultures could improve the sensitivity of bacteremia detection [59]. Additionally, obtaining both peripheral blood and central cultures and assessing the difference in time to detection in situations when both result in positive may assist with determination of catheter-related sepsis. A positive central line culture two or more hours prior to a positive peripheral culture has been associated with three times increased odds of catheter-related sepsis [60]. There was no direct evidence about the influence of peripheral blood cultures on clinical management decisions. Diagnostic yield can be increased by collecting two sets of blood cultures, and anaerobic cultures should be obtained as well. Blood cultures should be drawn prior to antibiotic administration if possible, but should not delay antibiotic administration [16].",

In the immunocompromised host, a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin or carbapenem is frequently indicated for empiric gram-negative coverage, with the addition of vancomycin or other anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) therapy depending on patient and geographic risk factors. Furthermore, for patients presenting with shock, additional gram-negative bacterial coverage with a monobactam, fluoroquinolone, or aminoglycoside is frequently warranted for synergistic effect. Antimicrobial coverage for patients with suspected enteric sepsis or aspiration should include anaerobic coverage. Infectious disease subspecialty consultation is recommended to tailor coverage, review prior infectious history and patient-specific risk factors, recommend alternative therapies in the setting of medication allergy or intolerance, and guide dose adjustment in renal and hepatic injury. Removal of central lines should be strongly considered for refractory septic shock or recurrent positive blood cultures with differential timeto positivity with consultation from infectious disease specialists [63].",

Secondary AKI is also strongly associated with mortality, and typical indications for continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVHDF), including refractory fluid overload and uncontrollable electrolyte abnormalities, should be applied in immunocompromised patients [93]. Risk for secondary infections remains high due to a combination of indwelling invasive devices, altered intestinal and respiratory microbiomes, and sepsis-induced immunoparalysis, and thus care should be maintained to surveil for potential new infections [94]. As pediatric immunocompromised patients are at risk for prolonged PICU stay, they are also at high risk for immobilization-related weakness, and thus physical, occupational, speech, and rehabilitation therapies should be offered to maximize return of daily functional status [95, 96].",

Some data exist supporting the ability of laboratory markers, including CRP, lactate, and liver and kidney function tests to predict length of hospital stay in patients with fever and neutropenia; however, data are absent on the ability of these parameters to predict the need for critical care. In general, single center studies that have shown lactate, albumin, and creatinine levels have decent specificity though low sensitivity in predicting mortality [102, 103]. A multicenter study of adverse events in children with fever and neutropenia secondary to cancer therapy identified four predictive characteristics of adverse events. Adverse events were defined by either a serious medical complication as a result of infection, including death, complications necessitating critical care, an identified microbiological infection, and radiological confirmation of pneumonia. These four characteristics were an elevated hemoglobin level (>9 g/DL), WBC < 0.3 G/L, platelet count <50 G/L, and preceding chemotherapy with greater intensity than acute lymphoblastic leukemia maintenance therapy. Although a defined weighted score was able to predict an adverse event (as defined above) with an overall sensitivity of > 92%, a specificity of 45% and negative predictive value of 93%, the specific adverse event of intensive care admission or mortality was not predictive [104]. As a result, critical care physicians need to have a high index of suspicion for immunocompromised patients presenting with fever, neutropenia with any laboratory derangements, abnormal radiological findings suggestive of infections, and abnormal vital signs or toxic appearance as a definitive predictive model has not been well elucidated.",

A clear understanding of the timing of immune reconstitution after allogeneic HSCT helps guide the clinician in anticipating which infectious pathogens patients are most at risk of developing during various time points after transplant. Initially, after conditioning therapy, patients develop an aplastic phase which involves severe neutropenia. This may also be termed a pre-engraftment phase. The innate immune system, consisting of neutrophils and NK cells, returns first over a time period of weeks, followed by adaptive immunity, T cells and B cells, over months to years. Specifically, neutrophils are the first cells to appear, followed by NK cells, then T cells and CD19+ B cells. The precise timing differs according to cell source, dose, and conditioning regimen. It is worth noting that even with return of cell counts, full function may be further delayed [110, 111].",

Often prophylactic antibiotics and antifungal agents are given during this time with escalation to broader treatment dosing when acute infection is suspected. Following engraftment of neutrophils, the first 100 days, known as engraftment phase, is a time of cellular immunodeficiency as both NK cells from the innate immune system and T cells of the adaptive immune system are attenuated. Viral infections and/or reactivations predominate, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Post-engraftment, after day 100, patients may still be vulnerable to viral infections. As B cells are the last to reconstitute, patients often have low levels of circulating immunoglobulins and as such are susceptible to infections with encapsulated bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza [110].",

Young children with HbSS are most at risk for pneumococcal infection and require prophylactic antibiotic coverage in the first 5 years of life with twice daily beta lactams as well as pneumococcal vaccination. Prophylactic antibiotics are discontinued at age 5 unless the child has undergone a splenectomy or has a history of pneumococcal infection [112]. Fever in a child with SCD warrants prompt assessment, blood cultures, and empiric antibiotics. Newborn screening for sickle cell disease is now universal in the United States, and all children with HbSS should be identified early with early initiation of pneumococcal prophylaxis; however, this does not entirely eliminate the risk, and invasive pneumococcal infection must be considered in pediatric patients with HbSS presenting with fever. Specific antibiotic regimens for patients with SCD presenting with fever may vary by institutional and hematology division guidelines; however, these often include ampicillin or third-generation cephalosporin with expansion to vancomycin for children who are toxic appearing, fever >39.5 degrees Celsius, leukopenia with WBC <5, or leukocytosis (WBC > 30).",

            "text": "Acute chest syndrome ( ACS) is another common complication of SCD. It is defined by acute onset of respiratory symptoms (cough, hypoxia, rales) with a new infiltrate on chest X-ray, most commonly right upper or middle lobe in children. The etiology may vary but ACS often arises secondary to infection, usually associated with atypical bacteria, or to pulmonary fat embolism [113, 114]. The Management of Sickle Cell Disease Summary of the 2014 Evidence-Based Report by Expert Panel Members published in JAMA identifies strong recommendations for the following: treatment with an intravenous cephalosporin, an oral macrolide antibiotic, supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation of >95%, and close monitoring for bronchospasm, acute anemia, and hypoxemia. Children developing critical illness with respiratory insufficiency or failure, worsening hypoxia with oxygen saturations <90% despite supplemental oxygen, progressive infiltrates, or acute anemia should receive urgent exchange transfusion in collaboration with the intensivist, hematologist, and apheresis teams. There is weak evidence for simple transfusion of 10 ml/kg of packed red blood cells to improve oxygen-carrying capacity for symptomatic children with ACS when hemoglobin concentration is >1 g/dL below baseline, with the exception of a baseline hemoglobin of \u22659 g/dL in which case transfusion may not be required. Lastly, the use of incentive spirometry while awake is strongly encouraged [115].",

The dysfunctional CTLs and NK cells continually secrete cytokines with loss of normal negative feedback, resulting in further activation of macrophages, NK cells, and CTLs; an uncontrolled cytokine storm ensues [116, 117]. Diagnosis of HLH is clinical and often blurred with similar symptoms of severe sepsis. Signs of uncontrolled inflammation may include fever, distributive shock, and coagulopathy. Additionally, laboratory abnormalities may be present, including elevated liver enzymes, cytopenias, and renal failure. Patients may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurological impairment with encephalopathy, and seizures. HLH biology and treatment are discussed in detail in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-01322-6_9.",

Notably, anti-thymoglobulin (ATG) is used as a therapy for severe aplastic anemia as well as for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis and treatment in HSCT patients. Studies demonstrate elevations in circulating cytokines after the initiation of anti-T cell therapy with ATG, specifically IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IL4, IL13, TNFa, IFNg, interferon gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL-2), and CCL-4 [118, 119]. Clinically, patients exposed to ATG (either rabbit or horse source) may develop acute hypersensitivity infusion reaction with fever, hypotension, as well as a delayed (approximately 10 days) serum sickness with fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and rash. Serum sickness results from host antibody responses to foreign proteins followed by formation and then deposition of immune complexes in tissues (skin, joints, and other organs) [118]. Careful attention to recent therapeutics may allow for quick and accurate diagnosis of underlying etiology of hematology/oncology patients presenting with signs and symptoms of sepsis.",
