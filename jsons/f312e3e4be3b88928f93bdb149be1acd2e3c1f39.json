The Conference Chairs decided to keep the initially planned dates (April 14-17, 2020) and move to a fully online event. In this report, we describe the experience of organizing the ECIR 2020 Workshops in this scenario from two perspectives: the workshop organizers and the workshop participants. We provide a report on the organizational aspect of these events and the consequences for participants. Covering the scientific dimension of each workshop is outside the scope of this article.",

The former is presented in Section 2 to describe the workshop organizers' feedback. The latter is introduced in Section 3 to describe the participants' perspective. Our general objective is to get a sense of the feeling of both stakeholders in this firsttime experience. Questions such as \"What was gained/lost?\"; \"What was harder/easier?\", \"What worked?\"; \"What didn't work?\" among many others will be dissected. We conclude this article by highlighting the main recommendations and lessons learned from this online experience. We believe this to be of potential importance for researchers interested in organizing similar events in the future. ECIR 2020 Workshops were held on April 14, 2020 (Tuesday) adopting Lisbon time (CEST+1), from 09h00 to 18h00. The first call for workshops was issued on July 22, 2019. We received a total of six proposals, one was later withdrawn, and four were accepted -three as full day events, one half-day. Workshop notifications were sent on October 1, one month after the submission deadline. On March 11, the decision to move to a fully online event was announced. We present a summary of the accepted ECIR 2020 Workshops in Table 1 .",

            "text": "BIAS 2020 [2] was the 1st edition of the International Workshop on Algorithmic Bias in Search and Recommendation 2 . BIAS was organized as a full-day event, chaired by Ludovico Boratto (EU-RECAT, Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Catalunya), Mirko Marras (University of Cagliari), Stefano Faralli (University of Rome Unitelma Sapienza), and Giovanni Stilo (University of L'Aquila). The workshop aimed at collecting novel ideas to detect, measure, characterize, and mitigate bias in data and algorithms underlying search and recommendation applications. The goal was to provide a common ground for researchers and practitioners working in this area. The workshop had more than 70 participants. The keynote speaker -Prof. Chirag Shah from the University of Washington (USA) -highlighted how bias, especially in relation to search and recommender systems, causes material problems for users, businesses, and society at large. The scientific program included demo and paper presentations and a final discussion. The papers covered topics from search and recommendation in online dating, education, and social media, over the impact of gender bias in word embeddings, to tools that allow exploration of bias and fairness on the Web. The event concluded with a discussion session to highlight open issues, research challenges, and briefly summarize the outcomes of the workshop. The workshop proceedings volume is going to be published soon in Springer's \"Communications in Computer and Information Science\" series. BIR 2020 [3] was the 10th edition of the International Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval 3 . BIR was organized as a full-day event and chaired by Guillaume Cabanac (Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse), Ingo Frommholz (University of Bedfordshire), and Philipp Mayr (GESIS -Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences). BIR tackles issues related to academic search, at the crossroads between Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and Bibliometrics. The keynote speaker -George Tsatsaronis, VP Data Science at Elsevier -addressed the topic of Metrics and Trends in Assessing the Scientific Impact. Eight papers were given live (no pre-recorded videos), each one followed by a Q&A session and greetings for the 10th anniversary edition from senior scholars in our field. The proceedings are published in open access at CEUR-WS [4] . Text2Story 2020 [5] was the 3rd edition of the International Workshop on Narrative Extraction from Texts 6 , chaired by Ricardo Campos (INESC TEC; Ci2 -Smart Cities Research Center, Polytechnic Institute of Tomar), Al\u00edpio Jorge (INESC TEC and FCUP -University of Porto), Adam Jatowt (Kyoto University) and Sumit Bhatia (IBM Research AI). It was organized as a fullday event and consisted of presentations of ten regular research papers, two position papers and one demonstration paper. The papers presented at the workshop 7,8 , were made available at CEUR [6] and cover diverse aspects of the narrative extraction problem ranging from applications of deep learning to narrative extraction, sentiment analysis, event coreference resolution to applications in different domains such as legal text, news and social media. The program also included two invited keynote talks. Sebasti\u00e3o Miranda, head of development at Priberam (Portugal), talked about monitoring multi-lingual, multimedia sources of information to discover relevant stories, events, and topics of interest to a specific user. Mark Finlayson, assistant professor at the School of Computing and Information Sciences of the Florida International University (USA), presented an overview of recent advances in Natural Language Processing applied to the task of narrative analysis in text.",

None of the respondents selected \"Should be avoided\" or \"Should not be allowed\". This indicates that in future, a hybrid organization model for workshops could be used where, for example, presentations are given by paper authors in person for both the on-site and remote audience at the same time.",

Comments on the use of Zoom suggest that it handled the workload well and removed some of the issues with a projector and shared computers that occur sometimes in a physical setting. Zoom presentations also meant that the viewers could all clearly see the slide and post questions on the chat ahead of the Q&A session. Subsequent questions could be clearly heard and understood by participants.

Two respondents also said they just missed human touch and hugs and one commented that although the workshop ran well they \"missed the personal contact a lot\".

The natural result was the lack of atmosphere -\"things were colder\", \"[not able to] joke around with audience\", \"[no] stimulating interaction\", \"[no] eye contact\", \"[no] spontaneity\". The organisers also commented that as the chairs or session chairs they needed a much higher level of concentration and intensity through the event to manage the platform and bilateral discussions.

Pre-recording talks and making them available via a channel like YouTube was also useful. A good suggestion was to involve student volunteers to help with managing communications during the event. We all learned that participants should be explicitly warned against (accidental) sharing of Zoom hyperlinks (which include the room's password) via social media as this likely led to the Zoombombing incident of one workshop.

The major advantage was felt to be the increase in both the number of attendees and the breadth, enabling those who may ordinarily have not been able to travel to participate. Especially for workshops with small budgets, online events facilitate the process of including keynote speakers. Online presentations, coupled with the requirement or option to send pre-recorded presentations have potential to alleviate the issue of no-shows which tend to be the concern of many organizers in the past. There were individual technical challenges (sound, connectivity, etc.) and one security incident but the major disadvantage was the lack of social interaction, of scientific networking and the ability to connect with people and discuss topics. Finding solutions to mitigate this decrease in interaction would greatly improve the online workshop experience.",

SIIRH was organized as a half-day event and chaired byFrancisco Couto (LASIGE, Universidade de Lisboa) and Martin Krallinger (BSC-CNS). The workshop included an open session covering novel contributions on IR technologies for heterogeneous health-related content open to multiple languages with a particular interest in the exploitation of structured controlled vocabularies and entity linking for document indexing and semantic search applications. The program committee was composed of 46 international researchers and selected three full papers and three short papers. A MESINESP/Plan TL Session was also part of the workshop for presentation and discussion of current work and new advances in the MESINESP shared task or other medical IR, QA or text categorization evaluation campaigns, as well as the exploitation of evaluation settings and data collections generated through these kind of community evaluation efforts. The Open Session included two keynote talks, one by Dr. Cher Han Lau, entitled CoronaTracker: A framework for managing and tracking data during crisis, and another by Lucy Lu Wang and Kyle Lo, entitled The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. The MESINESP/Plan TL Session included one keynote talk, by George Paliouras, entitled BioASQ: The challenge and the community of biomedical semantic indexing and question answering. Recordings of all talks are publically available in YouTube 4 and the preliminary proceedings are also publically available online 5 .",
