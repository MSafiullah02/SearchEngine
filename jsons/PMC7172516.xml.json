RNA viruses form the largest virus class, including major pathogens of humans and domestic animals (Moya et al., 2004). The underlying VIZIER concept champions a proactive approach to combating virus infections. At its core, it envisions that prototype drugs against viruses representing the Virus Universe must be developed and put on the shelf to become immediately available when they are needed most: to contain an outbreak of an \u201cold\u201d or newly emerging infection. To develop this broad range of drugs, targets for antiviral therapy must be identified in all major virus lineages. This is a huge undertaking, whose scale is determined by the known diversity of viruses and the complexity of virus proteomes. As the number of known viruses, closely tracked by the number of sequenced genomes, expands exponentially in time (Belshaw et al., 2009), so do the resources necessary to develop drugs, should each virus to be targeted.",

Firstly, to develop and manage a \u201ctraditional\u201d information component of the project that brought together researchers active in bioinformatics, virology, protein production, crystallography, enzymology, and drug development and testing. To this end, versatile and easy-to-use software tools and databases had to be implemented. Secondly, to provide the consortium with recommendations regarding RNA viruses and targets to be studied. This latter broad effort was complemented by the contributions of partners from other sections who selected viruses and designed targets using different approaches and often based on their expertise with a particular group of viruses or proteins. Thirdly, to develop software tools assisting with specialized tasks such as protein production and structure determination, and the dissemination of these results to other members of the consortium.",

Every participant in the consortium could use VaZyMolO as a shared platform to design targets for a selected virus. The second platform, Viralis, was used for expert-based predictions across a broad range of viruses. The interaction of researchers with the Viralis platform was typically managed through a strictly defined protocol which included submission of virus genomes for analysis and receipt of predictions through e-mail.",

For organizing the information component of the project, including management of accumulated data, we considered using initially a specialized Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). However, a delay with its development and implementation, as well as a lack of motivation to use it, prompted a search for alternative solutions. As a result, VIZIER Targets Database (see below) took over some major functionalities of data management (Fig. 1\n). It was also connected to the Xtrack software platform (Harris and Jones, 2002) which provided tools and an environment for the analysis of 3D structures. This database became a hub for protein crystallization and structures solved by the consortium. Xtrack, connected to EDBase \u2013 a server for 3D structure quality assessment \u2013 were also used to distribute the targets within the consortium and coordinate work in the crystallography section of VIZIER.",

            "text": "Three online interfaces, all empowered with search capabilities, are available to retrieve information at different levels:-The \u201cTargets Data Interface\u201d displays, in a tabular format, the information related to selected targets. This information may include the virus strain used to generate target DNA and amino-acid sequences, the primers\u2019 sequences for DNA amplification, as well as the description of the last step in the protein processing (Fig. 1(A)). The complete table can be re-arranged by ranking column values, and lines can be highlighted to facilitate comparison. This interface enables a fast checking of the processing progress for a set of proteins. When several closely related constructs are designed the interface provides a snapshot comparing constructs. It assists the user with assessing the impact, on protein production, of any variation in constructs, e.g. tag position, and amino-acid deletion, insertion, or replacement. For example, this type of comparison has been used to identify a crystallizable domain of an Astrovirus protease (Speroni et al., 2009).-The \u201cTargets Status Interface\u201d displays the status of the processed targets, from PCR production to structure determination using color coding (Fig. 1(B)). The status at each stage can be completed (green), ongoing (orange) or aborted (red). It also indicates the partners in charge of each production step. Using this interface, a comparative view of targets that have passed a production step (cloning, production, crystallization) can be retrieved easily. For example, one search request was sufficient to find what protein from \u201cflavivirus\u201d was \u201cat least crystallized\u201d, as illustrated in Fig. 3 of Coutard et al. (2008).-The VIZIER \u201cTargets Focus Interface\u201d was developed to present all data for each target on a single page (Fig. 1(C)). While the two previous interfaces allow one to get a comparative view of data and status within a set of targets, this interface focuses on a specific target and displays the technical information available in the database (sequencing of the expression clone, production file, etc.). Since the production of a given protein can be done in different laboratories for different purposes, the original production file can be shared through this interface, or as a PDF file exported from the ELN electronic laboratory book (Contur Software). In addition to the data provided by the VIZIER partner, data from other resources have been integrated, including computer-generated data such as the isoelectric point, the molecular weight and the amino-acid composition of the current target. PDB files related to the target, whenever available can be downloaded and can also be displayed using a Jmol applet launched from the page. Links to additional information on other resources are also displayed (e.g. Xtrack, ICTV DB, GenBank (Benson et al., 2008), PDB (Berman et al., 2007)). This and the other two target DB interfaces were used during the project as a \u201cbasic LIMS\u201d without requiring any specific program download.-This extended use of the VIZIER targets DB was facilitated by a barcode-like nomenclature for constructs that was developed by the consortium. Specifically, a name was assigned to each construct submitted to the DB; for many targets the initial name assignment was made upon target prediction by Viralis (see Section 4.2). The name consists of several parts which are organized in the following order from left to right: (i) the two-digit VIZIER Partner number, (ii) virus abbreviation, (iii) strain designation, (iv) two-digit construct number, (v) protein abbreviation, (vi) function abbreviation, (vii) two-digit target number, (viii) purification tag and its position in the construct. For example, VZ10SV-AY694184-11-3DL-RdRp-01HC is the name of the 3DL protein of the Sapovirus (SV), strain AY694184 provided by partner 10 (VZ10). It is the 11th construct (-11-) of the first predicted target (01) for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain that was cloned fused with His tag at the C-terminus (HC). A search for targets in the VIZIER targets DB can be done on each of the 8 parts of the name.\n",

It was made largely before the project started in close cooperation between virologists and bioinformaticians to include representatives of most major lineages of RNA viruses. For some large virus groups, notably Picornaviruses, with numerous human viruses, a rational selection of a reasonable number of viruses presented a challenge and was extended during the project. A detailed phylogenetic analysis of human enteroviruses (a subset of the Picornaviridae) that form several clusters of closely related viruses (HEV-A, HEV-B, HEV-C and HEV-D) provides an example of how this challenge was addressed (Fig. 2\n). From four human enteroviruses, the cluster HEV-C is of particular clinical importance. It includes three serotypes of poliovirus (PV), a significant human pathogen, and 11 serotypes of coxsackie A virus (C-CAV), a benign human pathogen. Using rooted phylogenetic analysis, it was demonstrated that PV was likely to have originated from an C-CAV-like ancestor (Jiang et al., 2007). Characterization of chimeras and recombinants between PVs and C-CAVs provided support for this evolutionary reconstruction. Based on these observations, it was further proposed that diverse C-CAVs, currently circulating in human population, form a potential reservoir for a new PV-like agent that may emerge. A new pathogenic virus could evolve once PV has been eradicated, after PV vaccination has stopped and once the human population has become immunologically na\u00efve with respect to anti-PV antibodies (Gromeier et al., 1999). This reasoning provided the basis for the decision to include C-CAVs on the list of viruses analyzed by VIZIER.",

There are several approaches to tackle domain boundary prediction for protein sequences, which can roughly be classified as either ab initio or homology-based; they can also be combined in a common framework (Yoo et al., 2008, Liu and Rost, 2004). Using the former approach, multi-domain proteins can be split into domains using different statistics accumulated about the domain borders in proteins and largely ignoring homology relationships. These statistics commonly take into account distributions of structurally disordered regions, secondary structure elements, solvent accessibility and amino-acid properties across globular domains and inter-domain junctions, as well as domain size variation, among others (Bryson et al., 2007, Dovidchenko et al., 2007, Suyama and Ohara, 2003, Dumontier et al., 2005). The second approach explores the homology relationships between proteins that commonly have different sizes and may include two or more domains (Sim et al., 2005, George and Heringa, 2002). The underlying idea is to align as many homologs as possible to identify those N- and C-termini that, when combined, would be separated by the shortest distance; by implication they would flank the smallest common domain for the analyzed set. Among parameters that are of critical importance for the success of this approach are the sensitivity and accuracy of methods used to identify and align homologs in the protein family. The predictive power of all these methods has improved over the years but remains limited in relation to the actual number of domains in proteins and the precise location of domain boundaries (Dovidchenko et al., 2007, Bryson et al., 2007).",

Neural network predictors have been developed for the identification of a subset of these sites that are recognized by 3C proteases of some picornaviruses (Blom et al., 1996) and 3C-like proteases of coronaviruses (Kiemer et al., 2004) and they can assist in the domain identification.

It allows the user to zoom in on information related to the selected organism (virus) and to map an overview for each CDS on the viral genome or, for a VaZyMolO domain, on the corresponding proteins. Diverse data including the amino-acid sequences, computed molecular weight, isoelectric point, and the presence of homologous domains in other proteins can be accessed (Fig. 4\n).-\nThe VaZyMolO Blast and Tools provides an interface to programs that use a sequence as the input for launching different analyses:\n(a)BLASTX and BLASTP mediate comparison of a query sequence against the VaZyMolO database to identify sequence regions having similarities with predicted domains in VaZyMolO.(b)BLAST mediates query comparison against two public databases, PDB and Merops (Rawlings et al., 2008), to retrieve information about known structures and proteins with known peptidase functions, respectively.(c)External tools such as HCA (hydrophobic cluster analysis), TMHMM (Prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins) (Krogh et al., 2001), are also available from this interface.

It allows fast, simultaneous analysis of a query sequence by multiple predictors and easy comparison of the results provided by the latter. It also enables standardized access to disorder predictors and allows meaningful comparisons among various query sequences. Regions of interest to be removed can then be manually highlighted and their sequences can be retrieved. The MeDor program was added to the tools available from the VaZyMolO Blast and Tools interface to enhance the capabilities of this interface. A stand-alone version of the program is available online for downloading.",

It is mainly written in Perl/Tcl and includes in-house genome and alignment MySQL relational databases (VDB-GS and VDB-GA, respectively) and integrated bioinformatics tools for comparative sequence analysis that are accessed from specialized modules. An original XML protocol was developed in Viralis for inter-module data transfer including information about biopolymer sequences, alignments, secondary structure and accompanying annotation. These modules provide access also to local copies of the public genome and protein databases including GenBank (Benson et al., 2008), UniProt (Bairoch et al., 2009), PFAM (Finn et al., 2008), CDD (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2009) and PDB (Berman et al., 2007). The databases are regularly updated and can be searched using diverse programs, including HMMER (Eddy, 1996), BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997), and COMPASS (Sadreyev and Grishin, 2003), to retrieve sequences that are subsequently aligned using ClustalX (Thompson et al., 1997), T-Coffee (Notredame et al., 2000, Simossis et al., 2005), MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004), or Dialign (Morgenstern, 2004) programs. Alignments can be analyzed to predict disorder regions using FoldUnfold (Galzitskaya et al., 2006) and RONN (Yang et al., 2005), and to map secondary structure elements identified in the tertiary structures of proteins (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) included in the alignment. Also the PROSITE database (Hulo et al., 2008) assists with the identification of sequence signatures characteristic for different protein families. Using these instruments, experts build and analyze alignments to produce functional and structural assignments mainly through transfer of knowledge from characterized proteins to their homologs. This annotation transfer is currently expert-mediated; in future, it could be made in a statistically rigorous fashion. As a step in this direction, comparative analysis of various annotation transfer statistics, based on the likelihood ratio criterion, has been conducted (Leontovich et al., 2008).",

It mediates sequence upload for expert analysis and access to up-to-date status of processing of all submitted queries and a database of predicted targets. To initiate query processing, the user was required to define a virus family of the uploaded sequence. Two ways of sequence uploading to Viralis were provided: by copy-and-paste or through retrieving a publicly available sequence from GenBank/RefSeq using their identifiers (gi, accession number, accession number with version, locus name). Each submitted sequence was assigned a unique name tag encoding names of submitting partner and virus to be studied, according to a convention developed by the VIZIER consortium (see Section 2). After a sequence was annotated in Viralis, tentative targets were sent from the Domain Prediction Response (DPR) module to the user who requested predictions (Fig. 7\n). Each target was selected from a pre-compiled domain list to initiate a response with the DPR module. At this stage, a target was assigned with a unique tag that was based on the respective sequence tag extended to include name abbreviations for protein and domain, and target version (two digits). The target response file included amino-acid and nucleotide sequences of the target flanked by extra sequences that are clearly highlighted and numbered. This format allowed the target recipient to verify the identity of the target and readily design primers for cloning. The DPR module provided also a mechanism for canceling target predictions by sending a notification to the target recipient. In practise, it was used mainly to correct target name assignments. The VIZIER users had ready access to all submitted sequences and received targets through the progress monitoring table at the Viralis WEB site (Fig. 6).",

It is based on several sequence characteristics, including genome conservation and length, and protein domain organization. When combined, these characteristics can uniquely identify genomes of a particular family. The procedure is essentially annotation-independent, virtually eliminating a possible negative effect of incomplete or erroneous entry annotations on genomes retrieval. A web site, provisionally called SARGENS (http://veb.lumc.nl/SARGENS), was also designed using Perl to provide public access to regularly updated databases of complete genomes of selected RNA virus families. They are available for downloading in the Fasta format and their GenBank records can be accessed through links at the SARGENS web page.",

The SNAD web site provides a user-friendly interface to a versatile tool that works with identifiers presented as a plain list or in diverse formats of multiple sequence alignments and trees. It can convert sequence IDs into names using sequence annotation from several public databases according to a name template that controls the structure and content of the name. The user can choose from a set of predefined templates or design a new template using a versatile template-building facility. An example of SNAD-mediated conversion using a virus tree as input and one of the predefined templates is illustrated in Fig. 8\n. This tool facilitates communication and knowledge dissemination about genome-based data that dominate output in virus-related research.",

Systems were needed to ensure interactions between the crystallographic laboratories, and between structural biologists and virologists. The Laboratory Without Walls concept (LW2) is our attempt to achieve this difficult goal. With the correct access privileges, a virologist in Leiden would be able to access the crystallographic information for a particular target that is being evaluated and generated by the crystallography group in Pavia, for example. At the same time, the target allocation committee may require access to the latest set of new targets from the protein production pipeline, and the necessary information that would be required to assign a particular target to a particular laboratory. The LW2 system, therefore, is needed for coordination as well as collaboration between VIZIER laboratories.

Xtrack was originally designed to be extremely simple to use by beginners and infrequent users, and we have tried to keep this philosophy in our more recent updates and developments. The deposited information is arranged around a collection; an entity associated with a set of crystallographic data associated with a particular structure. Collections in turn are split up into more detailed pages that may be related to the target, protein expression, crystallization, data collection, structure solution, refinement and validation; see Harris and Jones (2002) for more details. Access to the database is controlled by user accounts and passwords. All Xtrack users must be registered and assigned to one or more groups. The user may then read and modify data only within those groups, but all members within a particular group are implicitly trusted, and may modify any group-related data. In the Vizier implementation, each user belongs to two groups \u2013 one representing their laboratory, and the pseudo-group \u2018Vizier\u2019 which has only read access to other groups\u2019 data.",

One vital aspect of our project is the allocation of targets to the crystallographic laboratories. Since this target-related information is kept in Marseille and we had no desire to duplicate this, we have built bi-directional connections between the databases. The main target list page in Xtrack has a column labelled \u2018submission\u2019, containing names like VZ04MODV-Q8QL64-01-UNK-MT-01HN. These codes are the links to the Marseille VIZIER database entry for that target. At the bottom of that VIZIER database page is a link back to Xtrack. The implementation is through PHP's libcurl package, which uses a secure connection protocol. The connection is also restricted to the IP address of our two hosts. With this information in hand, new targets are given an initial allocation code POOL before being assigned to a crystallographic laboratory. Every night, a script is run to carry out a BLAST search (Altschul et al., 1990) of all targets within Xtrack amongst themselves and against the deposited structures at the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It then becomes relatively straightforward for the target allocation committee to see the most closely related structures that are being worked on within VIZIER and outside the consortium. The crystallographic laboratories can also use this information to decide on their internal priority for a particular target. Fig. 10\n, shows an Xtrack listing for one such target, VZ93, a methyltransferase from Modoc virus (Jansson et al., 2009).",

At this point the user can also choose to perform a refinement on the uploaded model within EDBase.

These tools provide a more quantitative approach to deciding the level at which electron-density maps (especially maps made with amplitudes of type |Fo| \u2212 |Fc|) should be inspected, and how to decide on the addition of new water molecules during crystallographic refinement. Such decisions are made in terms of the average carbonyl oxygen of the structure under refinement, using a 3D profile that is specific to this structure and crystallographic dataset. If an EDBase user elects to select water molecules based on a low fraction (e.g. 0.5), more waters will be selected which after crystallographic refinement will show a gradual increase in temperature factor. For structures solved to suitably high resolution, such a plot of increasing B-factors will often show a hockey-stick profile, Fig. 11b, that clearly indicates where waters should be deleted from the model. O's use of carbonyl oxygen profiles conveniently allows the user to recognize peaks that are not water molecules but ions or larger entities. The water_electron function in O will normalize the \u2018water\u2019 peak into electrons in an attempt to clarify the nature of the atom/group. False positives may occur due to model errors, non-spherical density, and/or low resolution.",

ValLigURL, Fig. 12\n, is a ligand-searching tool for the validation of ligand structures (Kleywegt and Harris, 2007). The server scans the PDB for a particular ligand, and then compares the geometries of the hits with that of the given ligand structure. As well as a geometric comparison, the structures can also be shown superimposed in the Jmol molecular viewer, and a SMILES representation of the ligand is generated that can be used to search for previously unpublished ligand structures. This service is intended to indicate anomalies in the geometry of refined ligands, by highlighting differences from published structures of the same ligand, and also to aid in identification of novel ligand conformations. It has connections to several external ligand servers:(1)BabelWeb/ChemDB (Chen et al., 2005) is used to generate the canonical SMILES representation of the ligand so that the user can take this away to their favorite similarity search engine.(2)Direct links are offered to PDBeChem's searches for substructures and superstructures that are found in the PDB (Golovin et al., 2004). From the results pages of these searches, PDBe offers links to further pages about similar ligands, including full chemical information, and a list of the PDB entries containing them.(3)There are connections to Relibase's similarity searches (Hendlich et al., 2003). This service now requires a cost-free registration to Relibase before the VaLigURL link can be used. The user can then get access to a list of similar ligands, and links to the PDB structures containing them.(4)The connection to SuperLigands (Michalsky et al., 2005) not only finds similar structures, but can superimpose them, and display the result using Chime.(5)The link to BindingDB (Liu et al., 2007) gives access to many more parameters for the ligand.\n",

Expectations and their execution were regularly debated at consortium meetings as the project progressed. These discussions raised awareness concerning cultural differences integral to such a broad enterprise, helped build bridges and develop practical solutions to produce inter-partner synergy. Each of the four major software platforms instrumental in the project's success, the VIZIER Target DB, VaZyMolO, Viralis and Xtrack/EDBase, was advanced with new tools, and their databases were updated. They were used to predict and analyze hundreds of domain targets, and conduct other analyses that led, particularly, to the development of a novel concept of virus emergence. To date, VaZyMolO database is publicly accessible without any restrictions and Xtrack and SNAD codes are freely available to the virology and the structural biology communities.",

Thus predicting new domains and refining old predictions remains a part of any sustainable effort to dissect the RNA virus proteome. Suitable target constructs need to be predicted for new viruses that are being identified literally every day, and at an ever increasing pace.

These tools have not only helped in the daily follow-up of the project, but they have considerably simplified inter-partner communications and the establishment of a common language that contributed to the project culture. Other information-related challenges abound downstream in the pipeline. Most of the laboratories involved in drug testing in VIZIER, for example, have their own pre-existing drug or chemical library databases. These are served with tools describing, managing, and retrieving information about small organic chemical molecules that have a drug potential. It becomes vital to integrate these drug databases into a network that could be used to produce, in a common format, data about structural, chemical, antiviral, pharmacological and toxicological properties related to viruses and targets, and to access all related information acquired on emerging viruses.
