Watson and Dr Francis Crick [1] , Dr Clyde E. Keeler predicted in 1947 that gene therapy would be 'a therapeutic technique' 'achieving permanent correction of hereditary diseases' [2] . Several years later in 1972, Dr Theodore Friedmann and Dr Richard Roblin predicted that 'gene therapy may ameliorate some human genetic diseases in the future' [3] . True to these predictions, gene therapy vectors have been the subject of extensive development over the last 40 years in efforts to insert or replace therapeutic genes in target cells of affected tissues and cure genetic diseases. Proof-of-principle for gene therapy became a reality in 1990, when 4-year-old Ashanti DeSilva, suffering from adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA SCID), was a subject of an ex vivo gene therapy trial [4, 5] . A subset of her T cells was removed, treated ex vivo with a gammaretrovirus expressing the ADA gene, and the gene-corrected T cells reintroduced into her circulation [5] . This process essentially reconstituted her immune system with gene-corrected T cells.

Gene therapy is a simple concept: delivery of DNA (or RNA) to the affected somatic cells of a specific tissue or organ will repair the defect, restore normal function and cure the subject of the specific disease phenotype. Almost 20 years ago cystic fibrosis (CF) [6] airway disease was characterized as an excellent candidate for gene therapy [7] on the basis that it was a monogenic disease [8, 9] and the level of gene expression necessary for correction of the disease phenotype was low ( 5%) [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 459, "end": 462, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 539, "end": 542, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 588, "end": 591, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 592, "end": 594, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 692, "end": 696, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The gene transfer tools that have been developed for the delivery of genes to various targets are either viral-based or non-viral-based ( Table 1) . Viral-based vectors exploit the ability of a virus to effectively transfer its genetic cargo into the target cell. For most gene therapy protocols designed for lifelong genetic diseases, re-administration of the virus-based gene transfer vector will be warranted. However, the majority of virus-based vectors induce potent humoral immune responses that will diminish the effectiveness of vector re-administration [11] [12] [13] . Additionally, preexisting immunity to a specific virus-based vector due to a previous infection with the wild-type virus or an earlier vector administration will also limit effective gene transfer. Indeed, in recent years this has been shown to be case in a number of preclinical and clinical models of gene transfer [11] . In contrast, non-viral vectors consist of lipids, peptides, carbohydrates, or nanoparticles that fuse with the cell membrane and release the therapeutic DNA into the cell cytoplasm and induce low, if any, immune responses. Below, representative gene therapeutics from both categories are discussed in detail. of the respiratory tract accounting for 10% of upper respiratory infections in young children and older adults [14] . Given their large cloning capacity ( 8 kb) [15] , they have been developed as gene therapy vectors for various genetic diseases including CF [16] . Although there are 50 serotypes of AdV, vectors based on serotypes 2 and 5, both members of subgroup C [17] , have been extensively reported to efficiently transfer transgenes to many cell types in vitro and to various tissues or organs in vivo [18] . AdV vectors can be produced at high titers [19] with minimal risk of contamination from replication-competent virus. However, as AdV vectors are non-integrative and non-replicating, they can only confer transient gene expression, the duration of which is dependent on the proliferation state of the target cell [20, 21] . AdVs have four early genes (E124), which encode polypeptides responsible for viral and cellular gene expression, viral replication, repression of major histocompatibility complex responses and inhibition of cellular apoptosis [21] . In first-generation AdV vectors, the early region (E1A/B), containing the transcriptional regulatory genes essential for viral replication, was replaced with an expression cassette for a transgene [22, 21] . These AdV vectors are propagated in E1-transcomplementing cell lines such as HEK293 [21] . The administration of first-generation AdV vectors in animals and in subjects in gene therapy clinical trials was found to elicit high inflammatory and immune responses. These responses were T cell-mediated and directed against both the vector and the transgene product, resulting in the elimination of transduced cells and compromising the duration of gene expression [23, 24] . In second generation AdV vectors, in addition to the E1 region, the E2, E3, or E4 regions were either deleted or disabled [25] . As a consequence, these AdV vectors exhibited lower levels of viral protein expression shown to be responsible for evoking host immune and inflammatory responses. The gene transfer efficiency of second-generation AdV vectors was no different than that of the first-generation AdV vectors [25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 562, "end": 566, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 567, "end": 571, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 572, "end": 576, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 896, "end": 900, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1327, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1377, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1475, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1585, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1727, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1773, "end": 1777, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2041, "end": 2045, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2046, "end": 2049, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2278, "end": 2282, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2482, "end": 2486, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2490, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2577, "end": 2581, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2953, "end": 2957, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2958, "end": 2961, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3086, "end": 3090, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3381, "end": 3385, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 146, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Gene Therapy Vectors"}, {"text": "In an effort to improve both the duration of gene expression and safety, helper-dependent AdV vectors were developed.

AAV vectors can positively transduce dividing and non-dividing cells, an advantage for those organs in which ,1% of cells are actively dividing (e.g. lung [31] ). To date, AAV has not been associated with any known human disease and is considered a safe vector for use in humans. To overcome dependence on second-strand synthesis, self-complementary AAV (scAAV) vectors were developed [32] . The two main benefits of these vectors were the rapid onset of gene expression and the significantly higher (up to 600-fold [33] ) levels of transgene expression compared with their single-stranded counterparts. However, the main disadvantage associated with the use of scAAV vectors is the further reduced cloning capacity to 2.2 kb [32] . In contrast to wild-type AAV, which integrates specifically into the q arm of chromosome 19 [34] , AAV vectors (including scAAV) integrate randomly (raising the possibility of insertional mutagenesis), or remain as stable episomal DNA [35] . In recent years, it was demonstrated that AAV vectors preferentially integrated into active genes following systemic delivery to the mouse liver raising the potential for cancer development [36] . AAV vector-mediated integration however, is not as common as that observed for retroviruses. AAV vectors do not possess the machinery necessary to activate genes or cause breaks in host chromosomes [37] . In subsequent large and long-term liver-directed gene transfer studies in mice [38] [39] [40] there was no evidence of tumorigenesis. Additionally, liver tumors have not been observed in long-term monkey studies (James M. Wilson, University of Pennsylvania, personal communication) nor in canine [41, 42] AAV-based liver-directed gene transfer studies. With respect to their safety profile, AAV vectors have been injected in more than 300 subjects with no serious adverse events reported [11] . An exception was the death of a young woman in 2007 who was enrolled in a gene therapy clinical trial for rheumatoid arthritis [43] . In this trial, an AAV1 vector expressing a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitor was injected intra-articularly to one knee of each enrolled subject. The female subject received the second vector injection 5 months following the first injection, however she died within 22 days of the injection [43] .

Recently, in an ex vivo phase I clinical trial an SIN LV vector expressing anti-CD19 linked to CD3-zeta and CD137 signaling domains was used to transduce ex vivo T cells harvested from a subject with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia [96] . The vector-treated T cells were then re-infused into the subject and expanded to a level that resulted in complete remission. These impressive data are forming the basis for further larger clinical trials. Nonetheless, strict attention is being paid to the risk of the potential of insertional mutagenesis for these LV vectors as well [96] . Specifically, in the ALD trial, investigators noted the presence of common insertion sites (CIS) in the treated cells [97] . Although these were found to be non-genotoxic CIS, the real risk needs to be addressed or at least carefully monitored in larger clinical trials using LV vectors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 365, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 467, "end": 471, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 714, "end": 718, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1060, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1185, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lentivirus-based vectors"}, {"text": "The efficiency of most non-viral gene transfer vectors (i.e. lipoplexes) used to deliver genes into target cells largely depends on the mechanisms that are present in the target cells for uptake and intracellular transport of particles [98] .

Long-term gene transfer studies in large canines [110, 42] , and non-human primates [111, 112] predicted that a therapeutic dose (2 \u00c2 10 12 vector genomes/ kg) of AAV2 would be effective at restoring adequate levels of serum-circulating levels of factor IX (FIX). However, following a liver-directed injection of AAV2-FIX vector in adult subjects with hemophilia B, only transient expression of FIX was observed [66] . The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are not entirely understood. However, it has been postulated that memory T cells against the AAV2 capsid, in combination with the compromised liver microenvironment of most patients with hemophilia B that have become infected with hepatitis B and C, contributed to the unpredicted cytolytic capsid-directed T cell response [113] . Current clinical trials for hemophilia B are employing two differing strategies: AAV2 with short-term immunosuppression and self-complementary AAV8 (at lower vector doses) in the absence of immunosuppression [11] . In addition to AAV2, AAV1 has also shown to be immunogenic when injected intramuscularly in humans. Specifically in a clinical trial for LPL deficiency, subjects were injected with AAV1 intramuscularly and at the higher vector doses capsid-specific CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells were detected [11] .

A recent report of gene replacement therapy for DMD suggests that some subjects may be at increased risk of clinically meaningful cytotoxic T cell responses against the transgenederived dystrophin protein due to pre-existing memory T cells to dystrophin. The authors concluded that primed T cells may contribute to DMD pathogenesis and enhance problematic T cell responses following gene therapy that aims to reconstitute normal dystrophin expression [116] . More concerning, however, for the application of gene therapy vectors in human subjects may be the prevalence of pre-existing T cells against the therapeutic gene reported for dystrophin [116] and recently CFTR [117] . The reason why these pre-existing T cells are present in patients with a specific genetic disease remains to be elucidated. Nonetheless, the role of these resident transgene-specific T cells in disease pathogenesis or the possible increased likelihood of rejection of transduced target cells following gene therapy needs to be carefully investigated.

Although there continues to be strong ethical debates regarding gene therapy in fetuses and/or young children, significant progress in pre-and postnatal gene therapy in various animal species, including macaques, have demonstrated both safety and efficacy. Specifically, exciting data from AAV gene transfer studies conducted in utero or shortly after birth in large animal models (macaques) now pave the way for prenatal gene therapy for genetic diseases with acute and immediate lifeshortening symptoms. Two examples are ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency [118] , which causes irreversible damage in young male babies soon after birth with 50% of subjects dying within weeks of birth [119, 120] , and some types of mucopolysaccharidoses in which irreversible brain damage occurs prior to or soon after birth [121] .
