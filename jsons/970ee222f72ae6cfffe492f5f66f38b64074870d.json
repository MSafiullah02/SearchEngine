Very little structural information about 2019-nCoV make this situation more difficult for drug designing. Benzylidenechromanones, naturally occurring oxygen heterocyclic compounds, having capability to inhibit various protein and receptors, have been designed here to block mutant variety of coronavirus main protease enzyme (SARC-CoV-2 M pro ) isolated from 2019-nCoV with the assistance of molecular docking, bioinformatics and molecular electrostatic potential. (Z)-3-(4\u2032-chlorobenzylidene)-thiochroman-4one showed highest binding affinity to the protein. Binding of a compound to this protein actually inhibits the replication and transcription of the virus and, ultimately, stop the virus multiplication. Incorporation of any functional groups to the basic benzylidenechromanones enhances their binding ability. Chloro and bromo substitutions amplify the binding affinity. ADME studies of all these compounds indicate they are lipophilic, high gastro intestine absorbable and blood-brain barrier permeable. The outcome reveals that the investigated benzylidenechromanones can be examined in the case of 2019-nCoV as potent inhibitory drug of SARC-CoV-2 M pro , for their strong inhibition ability, high reactivity and effective pharmacological properties.",

However, Michael reaction at \u03b1\u03b2-unsaturated ketone site of flavones 1 is difficult due to the participation of the ring oxygen (major contribution owing to the gaining of aromaticity of the ring C) as well as ring B in extended conjugation with the ketone (Fig. 2b , compound 1 to 1a) which decreases the electrophilicity at \u03b2-or C 2 position and increase the single bond character of the \u03b1\u03b2-double bond (C 2 = C 3 of 1 to 1a).",

They have also protein-binding abilities (Table S1 ; entry 8-11). In both cases, there is one ketone group (C 4 ), one \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated double bond (C 2 = C 3 for 1 and C 3 = C 11 for 2) and one rotatable phenyl ring are present. This is the reason why the class of compounds are often utilised in place of flavones. From the structural point of view, compound 2 has some advantages over 1. In the case of 2, the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone is more reactive for its exo-cyclic nature and the lack of conjugation with ring oxygen atom (Fig. 2b, structure 2) . The presence of exo-cyclic C=C double bond at C 3 without the previous type of conjugation enhances its reactivity and allows the compound 2 for facile Michael reaction at the C 11 position. Therefore, there is a chance of compound 2 as Michel acceptor during interaction with amino acid residue (Cys145 and His41) at the active site of the protein. These are the reasons for the choice of compound 2 as the best possible lead moiety in this study and compounds 2e-i were also be considered to explore the electronic features of 2 and it is discussed later.

Hence, the extent of binding forces in the protein-ligand complex depends on two factors, electronic distribution and the shape of the surface of the ligand. These can be predicted from the molecular electrostatic potential surface of the energyminimised geometry of a molecule by calculating Wang-Ford charges of all atoms [22, 23] . In MEP surface, electronegative atoms show negative values (red, hydrogen bonding acceptor) of charge, and it is positive in value for electronpoor atoms (blue, hydrogen bonding donor). The atoms with zero values (green, \u03c0and other types of staking interactions) are neutral in nature. This molecular detail helps to predict how much they are potential to take part in chemical reaction and to realise their mechanism of interactions. In addition to this, the surfaces provide the lower limit of the proximity of two molecules which describe the steric feature of the molecule [24] . Therefore, the quantum mechanically calculated properties of an energy minimised molecular geometry help to understand the steric, electronic feature and nature of binding forces of molecules.",

The electron density ring A of chromanone is quite higher (green to yellow) due to electron donation ring oxygen through conjugation which can favour the \u03c0-staking interaction with aromatic amino acid residues. This effect is enhanced in 2g for the presence of less electronegative atom sulphur in the ring. It is possible to manipulate the electron density at the benzylidene ring and C 11 position by adding different functional groups at the benzylidene part. Incorporation of oxygen containing functional groups (OMe) at benzylidene part (2b, 2e and 2h) increases the electron density to the ring (Fig. 3) . This enhancement of electron density is also favourable for the \u03c0-staking interaction. The case becomes more interesting for halogens because the single atom occupies a large electron density surface with negative values which is also suitable also for multiple \u03c0-staking interactions as well as halogen bonding. However, the halogen atoms at this part are unable to influence the electronic behaviour of the ring (green for 2c, 2d and 2g). Therefore, it is expected that these compounds may interact strongly with proteins. In the case of compound 2f, the electron rich oxygen in the furan ring polarises the ring electron cloud towards itself. The compound can bind strongly by hydrogen bonding. The extended conjugated hydrophobic benzylidene system is 2i and is very slightly electron rich with a large surface area (Fig. 3) . Therefore, small red, yellow and blue patches on the large green surface of compounds are balancing the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts which are essential for good binding to the protein.",

Molecular docking has been used here to predict the inhibitory activities of compounds 2a-i against mutant coronavirus main protease enzyme. In this study, we docked all the nine compounds with the SARC-CoV-2 M pro (pdb id: 6lu7) as well as three previously known coronavirus (pdb ids: 2q6f, 2q6d and 2h2z). The crystal structure of SARC-CoV-2 M pro contains a peptide fragment in its active site. The peptide-based ligand N3 is also docked and the docking score is considered as the control. All the designed compounds show a much higher binding affinity towards CoV M pro proteins with respect to the N3 (Table 2) . It is so interesting that the compounds bind strongly with the SARC-CoV-2 M pro in comparison to the previously known proteins ( Table 2 ). The study shows that the compound 2g perform best as anti-SARC-CoV-2 M pro ( Table 2 ). The more curious fact is that the more lipophilic molecule binds more strongly with the proteins. The presence of halogen atoms increases electron density as well as hydrophobicity of the molecule which goes in favour of their strong binding. The compound exhibited excellent results in all the bioavailability studies as discussed in the previous sections.",

There is a possibility of rotation of the C-C bond designated by cyan colour in Fig. 5b . This bond rotation can bring the grey-coloured carbon atoms of benzylidene ring closer to the amide carbonyl groups of R188 and Q189 residues (Fig. 5b) . Hydroxyl group substitution of the hydrogen atoms at the mentioned positions can involve in hydrogen bonding with the amino acid residue. The grey-coloured carbon atom at thiochromanone ring is closer to P140 and the carboxyl group of E166. Replacement of the attached hydrogen at the marked carbon by NH 2 group may The italic values indicates compound 2g is the best in the docking study render it capable of hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions. If these substitutions occur, the compound 2j can come into existence (Fig. 6a) . All the above studies are also performed for the 2j, and it is found that the compound is sufficiently hydrophobic (log P values are in Table S1 ). The presence of two hydroxyl groups and one amino group reduces the log S values (ESOL log S = \u2212 3.62, Ali log S = \u2212 4.41 and Silicos-IT log Sw = \u2212 4.25) slightly and enhances its water solubility. The compound has high gastrointestinal absorbance without BBB permeability. The compound may behave as Pgp substrate with low skin absorbability (log Kp = \u2212 6.37 cm/s). The compound 2j has the same bioavailability score (0.55) with other and low synthetic accessibility (3.29) . Therefore, the designed new compound is well in the pharmacokinetic point of view also. The MEP of 2j displays that the electron density increases in both the aromatic rings, in comparison to 2g, due to electron donation of OH and NH 2 groups (Fig. 6a) which is favourable to form strong \u03c0-staking interactions. The appearance of dark blue patch in the region of the amine group of 2j on the MEP surface is clue for strong hydrogen bonding. The docking of the compound with all the CoV M pro proteins shows that the compound 2j binds more strongly with the protein than that of 2g in each case. The increment in docking score of 2j (\u2212 7.88, \u2212 7.21, \u2212 6.31 and \u2212 7.13 for the protein with pdb id 6lu7, 2q6f, 2q6d and 2h2z, respectively) is slight which can be because of (Fig. 6b) . In addition to this, the hydrogen bonding between the ketone oxygen of 2j and E166 amino acid residue (1.94 \u00c5) is also observed here. Sulphur-\u03c0 (M94 and 165) and \u03c0-\u03c0 (H41) staking interactions are found with OH containing ring and N-H-\u03c0 (H163) found at thiochromanone ring. The sulphur-sulphur interactions are also observed between the compound and C145.",

It is very complicatedly related to the patients and show dependency on the type of compounds used, its doses as well as their interaction with the stage of infection. One of the primary tasks in drug discovery is to find a molecule with the least toxicity or nontoxicity from all aspects [38] . Therefore, the prediction of the toxicity of the molecules under investigation is also an essential part of this study. Here, we have judged all these molecules in different toxicity parameters. In this study, we have considered cardiotoxicity, organ toxicity (hepatotoxicity), toxicity endpoints (carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, mutagenicity and cytotoxicity), nuclear receptor signaling pathways (aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), androgen receptor (AR), androgen receptor ligand-binding domain (AR-LBD), aromatase, estrogen receptor alpha (ER), estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (ER-LBD) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Gamma)) and stress response pathways (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2/antioxidant responsive element (nrf2/ARE), heat shock factor response element (HSE), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), phosphoprotein (tumour suppressor) p53 and ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 5 (ATAD5)) [39] and details are given in Tables S5 and S6. Drugs like sertindole, terfenadine and cisapride, can inhibit the human ether-\u00e1-go-go related gene (hERG) K + channels, which have been stopped in use because of heart arrhythmia followed by death. The study shows that all the compounds except 2i and 2j can have an active tendency to bind with hERG K + channel [40] which results cardiac toxicity (Table S5) . Compounds 2a and 2g are almost non-toxic and passed all the above-mentioned toxicity parameters (Table S6) . A weak activity against carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity and AhR was predicted for 2a and only AhR activity for 2g. It was also predicted that all other compounds including 2j (cardiac non-toxic) are strongly active only in immunotoxicity. It is also interesting to note that such prediction on the five FDA-approved antiviral drugs (rilpivirine, dolutegravir, glecaprevir, grazoprevir and paritaprevir) also have the same strong immunotoxicity activity (Table S7) . Therefore, immunotoxicity may be allowed in some cases. Considering all these factors, it can be concluded that 2j is found to be the best in this case.",
