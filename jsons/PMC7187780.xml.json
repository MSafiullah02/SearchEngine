A potential influence of different combinations of solvent and detergent(s) was not found under production conditions (Fig. 3). In Fig. 5 for robustness studies, virus inactivation by different combinations of S/D is plotted versus the incubation time and late time points might indicate slower kinetics of virus inactivation. However, the data comprising only the first time point of virus inactivation to below limit of detection allow no conclusions on the kinetics of inactivation or efficiency of the different combinations of solvent and detergent(s). In Fig. 5, when the virus inactivation capacity is plotted versus the TNBP concentration, some low LRF values (\u22643 log) were observed for low concentrations of TNBP in combination with Tween 80. Again, the reason for those findings might be that most studies at low concentrations of TNBP were done for the combination of TNPB/Tween 80. Thus, a potential influence might be feigned by the smaller number of data for other combinations of S/D. A potential influence of the different combinations on mean values of virus inactivation cannot be identified. Also, when data are plotted versus incubation time, the mean values of inactivation scatter around a magnitude of 4 log inactivation or higher. However, short incubation times in robustness studies result in a larger range of inactivation values.",

As TNBP is essentially combined with detergents, a reduced concentration of TNBP also implies reduced concentrations of detergents. A potential influence of detergent alone or of decreasing concentrations of detergent at a standard concentration of TNBP was not addressed in the studies presented here. TNBP is almost insoluble in aqueous solutions; thus a sufficient amount of detergent is essential for efficient virus inactivation. Elevated concentrations of Tween 80 in a FVIII solution up to 1.8% (18 g/L) instead of 1% (10 g/L) had no influence on PRV inactivation after 60 minutes of treatment.",
