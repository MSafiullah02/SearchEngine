CD4+ T cells can be further divided based upon the cytokines they secrete, into Th0, Th1, Th2 and Th3 cells (reviewed in [11]). CD4+ T cells help other cells by cognate interaction and/or the secretion of soluble mediators, such as cytokines. CD8+ T cells are also potent producers of cytokines and kill pathogen-infected cells or tumour cells directly [12]. The production of cytokines by T cells contributes significantly to the clinical symptoms that are associated with many lung viral infections. The regulation or inhibition of T cells might, therefore, be of therapeutic potential during respiratory infection.",

The point at which T cells perform their effector actions might occur during the expansion and effector phases of the T-cell response, whereas the induction of memory occurs during contraction in the late effector phase. T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize small peptide fragments of antigen that are presented by major histocompatibility molecules (MHCs); MHC class I for CTLs and MHC class II for Th cells. MHC molecules are constitutively expressed at low levels on \u2018professional\u2019 antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as B cells, dendritic cells and macrophages, but are also upregulated or induced on a variety of other cell types during inflammation. The progression of T cells to full effector function, and especially entry into the memory pool, requires a variety of additional signals. The precise requirement, sequence and cooperation among such signals to maintain T-cell responses and to prevent cell death are beginning to be determined. Cytokines, such as IL-2, assist initial T-cell proliferation, but a variety of additional co-stimulatory signals between the T cell and APCs are required for expansion, survival and entry into the memory pool (Figure 1\n).",

Although CD28 co-stimulation is essential for the activation of na\u00efve T cells that have entered the cell cycle, its requirement for memory T-cell responses depends on the model system 16, 17. CD27 (which is expressed on resting T cells and binds to CD70 expressed on APCs and activated T cells) might also function during early T-cell activation. Recent evidence in CD28-knockout mice suggests that CD27 does not affect the cell cycle but sustains T-cell survival through several divisions, rather than influencing the number of dividing cells 17, 18. Inhibitory molecules, such as CTLA-4 and PD1, are upregulated to limit clonal expansion (reviewed in 19, 20, 21). The majority of cells at this stage die by apoptosis, and only if they receive further survival signals do they progress into the memory pool (from which they can be rapidly reactivated to counter future antigenic insults).",

Expression requires TCR\u2013MHC\u2013peptide interaction and, although CD28 signalling enhances expression, both OX40 and 4-1BB can be expressed in its absence 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. The re-expression of OX40 (data are not yet available for 4-1BB) is much faster (within 4 h) on resting, previously activated T cells [27]. OX40 and 4-1BB can be expressed on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, depending on the experimental system used 28, 29, 30, 31. It should be noted, however, that other cell types, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells and eosinophils, might also express 4-1BB (Table 1\n) (reviewed in [13]).",

For OX40 and 4-1BB, binding to TRAF2 activates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and AKT [44], which upregulate the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bfl-1 [45]. All co-stimulatory TNF-receptor molecules induce cell survival through NF-\u03baB, Jun N-terminal kinase and AP1 (reviewed in 13, 37, 46). The precise signalling pathways involved are still being elucidated. At present, co-stimulatory TNF-receptor molecules seem to share common signalling events, although further analysis might show some specificity through the precise combination of signals and the time at which they occur, relative to T-cell activation.",

Once activated by antigenic peptides presented by MHC molecules in the lymph nodes that are associated with the inflammatory site, T cells acquire chemokine receptors and homing molecules that enable entry into non-lymphoid inflamed tissues. The respiratory tract contains lymphoid tissue in the nose itself (nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, NALT), small foci of follicles (predominantly B cells) that are associated with the bronchi (although this reduces with age) and scattered lymphocytes throughout the lung parenchyma (although these are virtually absent in a healthy individual). The lower airways are not associated with constitutive secondary lymph nodes, nor do they possess classical afferent and efferent lymphatics. Mediastinal lymph nodes are induced following infection, display typical characteristics of secondary lymphoid tissue and retract once inflammation has subsided. The lung encounters a vast array of potentially antigenic material. A significant role for lung APCs is, therefore, the induction of tolerance, which is mediated by lung dendritic cells producing IL-10 (which induces the development of regulatory T cells) and is dependent on co-stimulation by CD86 (B7\u20132) and ICOS\u2013ICOSL interactions [47]. The propensity for IL-10 production, however, might inadvertently induce allergic Th2 cells [48]. Despite the expression of B7 molecules, alveolar macrophages are poor at co-stimulating T cells [49] and also produce significant quantities of IL-10 [50]. Vigorous T-cell responses can occur if the threat exceeds the immune-suppressive environment. Nasal and airway epithelial cells express B-7 molecules, implying that they participate in na\u00efve T-cell priming [51]. However, the majority of T-cell activation is thought to occur in lung-associated lymph nodes. Beyer et al.\n[52] showed that, during viral infection, the number and activation of pulmonary APCs increases [53].",

Although influenza virus is still eliminated, the kinetics of clearance is delayed [60]. The complication with using soluble CTLA-4 is that there are two forms of the receptor [B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86)], which seem to have subtly different roles. However, this might provide more subtle intervention opportunities, because mutated CTLA-4\u2013Ig inhibits influenza-induced inflammation without preventing viral clearance [60].

The effect on both primary and memory responses lends further support to the hypothesis that CD27 acts concurrently with, or at least very close to, CD28 signals. Recent data from Hendriks et al.\n[17] show that CD27 and CD28 cooperate in the CD8+ T-cell response to influenza virus infection. CD27 can compensate for the lack of CD28 during influenza-specific T-cell responses in the lung and for T-cell priming in the mediastinal lymph nodes, whereas in mice lacking both molecules, T-cell responses are virtually absent. The influence of CD27 on virus-specific T-cell responses appears to be restricted to the site of viral replication because splenic CD8+ T cells are unaffected. In addition, mice lacking CD27 or CD28, or both, show reduced recall CD8+ T-cell responses to an influenza virus challenge. The mode of action of each molecule might differ subtly depending on the site studied. CD28, but not CD27, affects the cell cycle, whereas CD27, particularly in the lung, assists with the survival of antigen-activated CD8+ T cells.",

Agonistic antibodies against 4-1BB restore the defect in secondary CD8+ T cells in influenza-infected 4-1BB-knockout mice, but only when administered during secondary, and not primary, responses. Interestingly, agonistic antibodies against 4-1BB can restore the defective primary CD8+ T-cell response in CD28-knockout mice when administered early during infection [65]. 4-1BB is, therefore, important for the generation of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells.

More importantly, such treatment is beneficial three days after the onset of clinical symptoms [29]. The reduction of virus-associated illness is accompanied by a reduced cellular infiltrate into the airways and lung parenchyma. A reduction in the proliferation and an enhancement in the apoptosis of lung cells accounts for this reduced cellularity. These data are partially supported by studies in OX40-knockout mice, in which CD4+ T-cell infiltrates were reduced. However, no effect was observed on CD8+ T-cell responses [66].

Influenza virus is inflammatory and, therefore, a moderate reduction in the vigour of the inflammatory response might be beneficial without affecting virus clearance. The ability to clear viral infection despite significantly reduced lung inflammation might also reflect redundancy among late co-stimulatory signals and the presence of intact innate and antibody-mediated immune mechanisms. For example, the inhibition of OX40 leaves the 4-1BB co-stimulatory pathway intact. This hypothesis is consistent with the efficient control of other infections in OX40-knockout mice 66, 67. CD27-knockout mice similarly recover from influenza virus infection without displaying any signs of illness [61]. The interruption of CD30, which is also expressed on effector and memory T cells, has yet to be tested in models of lung viral infection. To understand the synergy and redundancy it will be important to examine anti-viral immunity in an environment that is deficient for multiple late co-stimulatory molecules (e.g. 4-1BB and OX40).",

            "text": "A clear conclusion from in vivo lung infection models is that a reduction, but not an elimination, of inflammatory infiltrate reduces the clinical manifestations without compromising pathogen clearance. The manner in which this reduction is achieved is important. The manipulation of late co-stimulatory molecules is tempting because of their predominant expression on effector, but not na\u00efve, T cells. It is likely that the inhibition of OX40, 4-1BB or CD30 would serve this purpose, although studies on the protection from re-infection and clinical disease are required following the manipulation of 4-1BB and CD30. Other co-stimulatory molecules, such as herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM, which is expressed on na\u00efve, and some memory T cells) and CD30 (which is expressed on effector cells and some memory cells), have yet to be tested. Similarly, the engagement of PD-1 on activated T cells by either of the two ligands (PDL-1 and PDL-2) inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion 20, 21. Soluble forms of these ligands or agonistic antibodies against PD-1 might, therefore, limit excessive T-cell expansion, although this has yet to be tested in models of inflammatory lung disease. It might also be possible to manipulate late co-stimulatory molecules by interfering with the signalling pathway. TNF receptor family members have been shown to bind to TRAFs [37]. At present, it appears that the inhibition of signalling might concurrently affect too many co-stimulatory molecules. By manipulating molecules on the cell surface, the redundancy that exists could be advantageous. Although the outcome of inhibiting co-stimulatory molecules is clear, the mechanism is not. Therefore, further studies will need to address whether manipulation alters T-cell survival, cytokine production and/or chemokine receptor expression patterns [22].",

The nature of the compound that is used to manipulate co-stimulatory signals will require significant thought, because the production of fusion proteins and antibodies is expensive.

T cells scan the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for specific antigenic peptides that are expressed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II molecules. This is facilitated by the interaction of leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 with T-cell binding to intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 on the APC. Recognition of peptide\u2013MHC by the T-cell receptor (TCR) is not sufficient to fully activate the T cell. A second co-stimulatory interaction between CD28 on the T cell and CD80 and/or CD86 (B7) on the APC is required. Expansion of activated T cells is then facilitated by additional co-stimulatory signals. CD27 is upregulated on activated T cells, as is inducible co-stimulatory molecule (ICOS). During the later stages of the effector response, T-cell activation is reduced by the expression of CTLA-4, which competes with CD28 for binding to CD80 and/or CD86 (B7). To maintain T-cell activation and form the memory pool, additional signals are required. OX40, 4-1BB and CD30 are induced on T cells and bind to their respective ligands on APCs, providing a survival advantage. The interaction of OX40 with OX40 ligand also reduces the expression of CTLA-4. It is not yet known how long ICOS persists on T cells or whether co-stimulatory molecules are present on memory cells (studies suggest that although CD27 is constitutive, it is downregulated on memory T cells). It is also unclear whether multiple co-stimulatory molecules exist on the same T cell.",

            "text": "Figure 2: The coordinated activation of T lymphocytes during acute pulmonary viral infection. (a) Infection of the respiratory epithelium, alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells (e.g. with influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus) causes the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit immune cells to the lung. Some epithelial cells that are killed during replication of the virus are ingested by antigen presenting cells (APCs). These, together with directly infected APCs, migrate to the expanding lung-associated lymph nodes (such as the mediastinal lymph node). Na\u00efve T cells enter the lymph node from the blood and are activated by the viral antigens that are presented on APCs. The activation of T cells depends on the co-stimulatory interaction between CD28 and B7, and results in the expression of alternative chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules that facilitate the entry of activated T cells into the inflamed lung. (b) From 2\u20134 days after lung infection, T cells are further expanded and upregulate late co-stimulatory molecules (OX40 and possibly 4-1BB). These cells migrate to the site of viral replication via the blood. Note that inflamed endothelial cells can also express OX40L, which might facilitate the movement of OX40-expressing T cells into the lung. Once in the lung, further activation occurs through the interaction with activated APCs or epithelial cells (which can upregulate co-stimulatory molecules). (c) By days 4\u20138, the level of T-cell recruitment and activation is maximal. OX40 (and probably 4-1BB)-expressing T cells accumulate in and around the airways and blood vessels, disrupting their function. This, together with excessive inflammatory cytokine production, causes the clinical symptoms of infection (sweating, weight loss, cachexia and appetite suppression). (d) If the virus is eliminated and the patient survives, by day 8\u201318, the inflammatory infiltrate subsides (by activation-induced cell death) and the mediastinal lymph node reduces in size. Some antigen-specific cells survive this contraction process and migrate to the spleen as memory T cells. For clarity, we have omitted inducible co-stimulatory molecule (ICOS), which is induced much faster than OX40. The precise timing of co-stimulatory molecule expression is affected by the precise pathogen and dose.",
