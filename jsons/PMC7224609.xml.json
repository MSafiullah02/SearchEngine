Patients who were intubated, who died, or who were transferred to another facility within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department were excluded from the analysis.

The suggested hydroxychloroquine regimen was a loading dose of 600 mg twice on day 1, followed by 400 mg daily for 4 additional days. Azithromycin at a dose of 500 mg on day 1 and then 250 mg daily for 4 more days in combination with hydroxychloroquine was an additional suggested therapeutic option. The azithromycin suggestion was removed on April 12, 2020, and the hydroxychloroquine suggestion was removed on April 29, 2020.

The individual propensities for receipt of hydroxychloroquine treatment were estimated with the use of a multivariable logistic-regression model that included the same covariates as the Cox regression model.

This report has not yet been fully peer-reviewed, but results were posted to the MedRxiv website for public comment.13 Investigators reported a faster mean time to clinical recovery (resolution of fever and cough and improvement on chest radiography) in the experimental group than in the control group. Four patients (all in the control group) had progression to severe infection.

We also performed a series of analyses using several propensity-score approaches. Findings were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. The consistency of the results across these analyses is reassuring. In our analysis, we adjusted for likely confounders, including age, race and ethnic group, body-mass index, diabetes, underlying kidney disease, chronic lung disease, hypertension, baseline vital signs, Pao2:Fio2, and inflammatory markers of the severity of illness. Despite this extensive adjustment, it is still possible that some amount of unmeasured confounding remains. Additional limitations of our study include missing data for some variables and potential for inaccuracies in the electronic health records, such as lack of documentation of smoking and coexisting illness for some patients. Nonetheless, we used contemporary methods to deal with missing data to minimize bias. Finally, the single-center design may limit the generalizability of these results.",
