The MASE, introduced by Hyndman and Koehler (2006) , compares the within-sample error of each model to the error of a corresponding na\u00efve forecasting model. MASE values greater than one indicate a na\u00eeve model would have lower error, while values less than one indicate the chosen SARIMA model has a lower error. In all models used in this study, the MASE was lower than one. For many forecasting circumstances, it would be preferable to compare models by comparing out-of-sample forecasting error. In the present case no comparable out-of-sample data were available because the pandemic has occurred everywhere (precluding the use of data from other cities) and because data from after the beginning of the pandemic cannot be assumed to be comparable to those from before it began.",
