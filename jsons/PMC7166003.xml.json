First COVID-19 cases were confirmed in individuals who had previously visited this market [1]. Nevertheless, the following COVID-19 cases were not exposed to this kind of seafood market- related infection. Therefore, a potential human to human transmission was suggested to be the main source of the virus spread [1]. The virus is transmitted between individuals through respiratory droplets that are produced by an infected person while sneezing, coughing or talking and staying in the short distance from another person. Direct contact with a person with COVID-19 or a direct contact with the surfaces contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 with subsequent contact with own nasal cavity, oral cavity or eyes are also sources of infection [1]. Oro-fecal transmission of the virus is presumably also possible. It was suggested that the two meters distance between an infected and non-infected person should be enough to avoid infection [2]. Van Doremalen et al. conducted an experimental study in which they reported that SARS-CoV-2 was able to remain viable in aerosols for 3 h [3]. SARS-CoV-2 survived up to 72 h on plastic and stainless steel, on copper the virus was not detected after 4 h, while on cardboard no viable virus was found after 24 h [3].",

In patients positive for COVID-19 or in those with unknown COVID-19 status, cuffed and non-fenestrated tracheostomy tube should be used to prevent SARS-Cov-2 from aerosolizing [28]. The cuff of the endotracheal tube should not be perforated during the procedure. The mechanic ventilation should be suspended while making the opening in the trachea and during the tracheostomy tube insertion into the trachea [28]. Heat and moisture exchanger (HME) ought to be immediately connected with the tracheostomy to reduce the spread of the virus. Subsequently it should not be disconnected [28]. It is recommended to avoid humidified closed circuits to minimize the chance of the virus-induced space contamination in case of the system disjunction [28]. The closed gear used in patients after tracheostomy should be the same as used for patients connected to a mechanical ventilator [29]. After the surgery, the tracheostomy tube should not be changed until patient\u2019s COVID-19 status is positive or unknown [28].

That could eliminate the exposure of healthcare service to close contact with a patient while taking naso- or oropharyngeal swabs [33]. It was also reported that in several cases saliva was more accurate material to detect coronavirus than nasopharyngeal swab [34]. Authors from China reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in saliva specimens obtained from 91.7% of patients with COVID-19 [33]. Saliva was taken into a sterile container from patients while spitting saliva from throat and subsequently analyzed using nucleic acid extraction and RT-PCR test [33].",

Ai et al. conducted a large cohort study performed on patients with positive RT-PCR test revealing that the sensitivity of chest CT in implying the presence of COVID-19 reached 97% [32]. The sensitivity of RT-PCR tests and chest CT for diagnosing COVID-19 in suspected individuals reached 59% and 88%, respectively [32]. 60% to 93% of patients in this cohort presented initial positive chest CT suggesting COVID-19 before the initial RT-PCR test detected SARS-CoV-2 [32]. 42% of patients with COVID-19 presented improvement in the follow-up chest CT before the test based on RT-PCR results turned negative [32]. The authors suggested that chest CT could be considered as a sensitive and useful test in detecting COVID-19 in the areas affected by COVID-19 epidemic [32]. CT of the thoracic cavity revealing ground-glass opacities, infiltrates and bronchovascular thickening consolidations strongly suggest SARS-CoV-2 infection [23].",

COVID-19 could also manifest as a sudden hyposmia or anosmia not accompanied by any other symptom. Whether SARS-CoV-2-induced hyposmia/anosmia is reversible remain unknown. URT symptoms are commonly observed in younger patients and usually appear initially. They may precede the development of severe COVID-19.
