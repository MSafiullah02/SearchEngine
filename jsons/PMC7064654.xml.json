Most of them also have other comorbidities, compounding the surgical risk higher than their benign counterparts [1, 2]. These comorbidities are advanced age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and malignancy itself [2]. Gawande et al. devised SAS in 2007 at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Boston, in a cohort of 303 patients undergoing genera surgical procedures [3]. The score is easy to calculate at the end of a surgical procedure by recording the lowest mean arterial pressure (MAP), lowest heart rate (HR), and estimated blood loss (EBL). These variables are then allotted a score and added to get SAS (Table 1).",

An informed consent was obtained for all patients included in study. All three variables needed for SAS calculation were recorded immediately at the end of surgery, with the assistance of anesthesiologist. Any complication event, as per Clavien-Dindo classification, up to a 30-day period postsurgery was recorded. Descriptive statistics were used for all patients and other co-variates, i.e., age, BMI, and ASA grades. A SAS cut-off of 5 or less and 6 or more was used to compare complication events in these subgroups, based on previous studies where scores \u2264 6 have been found to be associated with higher complications [1, 4, 6\u20138]. Women aged 18 years or more were considered for this study. Their clinico-pathologic characteristics, co-morbidities, and intraoperative events were recorded. Hospital stay was not used as a variable in analysis as many patients had a longer hospital stay due to administrative issues. Descriptive statistics and chi-square test were used for statistical analysis.",

ASA classification reflects the patients\u2019 preoperative physical status only and therefore does not reflect the patients\u2019 intraoperative conditions due to unexpected complications during surgery. APACHE and POSSUM are complicated and cumbersome to calculate and thus not widely used in clinical practice for postoperative risk prediction. SOFA and qSOFA need lesser variables for calculation; however, these are utilized once patient is admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. SAS seems to be the only reliable and objective parameter to decide intensive care for a given patient. In its absence, surgeon\u2019s or anesthesiologist\u2019s clinical acumen decides which patient would require intensive care. SAS can add to this judgment and improve patient\u2019s postoperative outcome.",
