Viral RNA was present in our patient\u2019s conjunctival sacs for at least 5 days. The viral RNA levels in conjunctival specimens were dramatically lower than those in respiratory samples. More viral RNA in conjunctival sacs (inversely related to Ct value)9 was detected 13 days after onset, soon after the symptom onset of acute conjunctivitis. Conjunctival specimens obtained on illness days 13, 14, 17 and 19 showed a trend toward decreasing levels of viral RNA. The result suggested that viral loads in conjunctival specimens gradually decrease over time with less potential for transmissibility accompanied by improvement of the ocular symptoms.",

This case report highlights the necessity to further understand the full spectrum, duration and natural history of ocular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform clinical treatment and affect precaution practices. Our case confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 led to ocular complications, but not in the early stage of infection. On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival specimens might represent a source of spread, particularly with higher viral loads at the acute stage of ocular complications. On the other hand, the conjunctiva might not serve as an ideal site for sampling for early diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
