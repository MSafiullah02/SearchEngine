The complexity of the system has increased even further now that we know that Ang II activates more than one receptor, that Ang II has metabolites which activate their own receptors, and that there may even be receptors for renin and prorenin.

Most species have one renin gene (ren-1 c ), although some mouse strains have two renin genes, ren-1 d and a submandibular variant, designated as ren-2. The ren-2 gene is encoding for a nonglycosylated prorenin, as opposed to the ren-1 gene which can be glycosylated at three asparagine residues.

In vivo, proteolytic activation is probably mediated by a proconvertase in the renin-producing cells of the juxta-glomerular apparatus of the kidney. Non-proteolytic activation of prorenin is a reversible process in which prorenin is converted from the 'closed ' (inactive) to the 'open' (active) conformation by unfolding of the prosegment from the enzymatic cleft .

Prorenin and renin are both rapidly internalized after binding to this receptor, and internalized prorenin is proteolytically converted to renin.

Somatic ACE has 2 homologous domains which share 60% sequence homology. Both domains contain a catalytically active site (Wei et al 1991a) and are situated at the N-and C-terminal side of ACE.

Testis ACE possesses only one catalytic domain which is identical to the C-domain of somatic ACE. Studies selectively blocking the Cand N-domain of somatic ACE revealed that conversion of Ang I to Ang II by membrane-bound ACE depends on the C-domain, whereas both domains contribute to this conversion in soluble ACE (van Esch et al 2005) . Degradation of bradykinin at tissue sites also required both domains (Tom et al 2001) .

Evidence for AT 2 receptor mediated vasodilatation is largely based on two approaches: an indirect approach, showing an enhanced response to Ang II in the presence of AT 2 receptor blockade or gene disruption (Hein et al 1995; Ichiki et al 1995; Batenburg et al 2004; van Esch et al 2006) , and a direct approach showing AT 2 receptor-induced responses by applying either the (partial) AT 2 receptor agonist CGP42112A or Ang II in the presence of an AT 1 receptor blocker (Widdop et al 2002; Li and Widdop 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 230, "text": "(Hein et al 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 231, "end": 249, "text": "Ichiki et al 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 250, "end": 269, "text": "AbdAlla et al 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 270, "end": 289, "text": "Schuijt et al 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 290, "end": 311, "text": "Batenburg et al 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 757, "end": 774, "text": "(Hein et al 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 775, "end": 793, "text": "Ichiki et al 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 794, "end": 815, "text": "Batenburg et al 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 816, "end": 836, "text": "van Esch et al 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1039, "text": "(Widdop et al 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1059, "text": "Li and Widdop 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AT 2 receptor"}, {"text": "The AT 2 receptor gene was first cloned in 1993 (Mukoyama et al 1993) .

This situation changes rapidly after birth, resulting in the AT 1 receptor becoming the dominant subtype in most adult tissues (Widdop et al 2003) . Yet, in adults, AT 2 receptors can still be detected in a variety of tissues, including uterus, ovary, adrenal medulla, heart, blood vessels and brain (Bottari et al 1993) . Here it is important to consider that the distribution of the AT 2 receptor depends on age and species, but is also subject to changes in expression during pregnancy and pathological conditions such as hypertension, heart failure and vascular injury (see below) (Bottari et al 1993; de Gasparo et al 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 48, "end": 69, "text": "(Mukoyama et al 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 489, "end": 508, "text": "(Widdop et al 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 662, "end": 682, "text": "(Bottari et al 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 947, "end": 967, "text": "(Bottari et al 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 968, "end": 990, "text": "de Gasparo et al 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "AT 2 receptor"}, {"text": "In 1995, two groups reported that deletion of the AT 2 receptor in mice led to an increased pressor response to Ang II (Hein et al 1995; Ichiki et al 1995) .

Up to now, three specific phosphatases have been linked to AT 2 receptor activation: MAPK phosphatase 1, SH2-domain-containing phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A.

Activation of the AT 2 receptor counteracts these growth-promoting actions by dephosphorylation through subsequent activation of phosphatases.

Initially, it was thought that all components required for local Ang II production (i.e., renin, angiotensinogen and ACE) would be produced at tissue sites. Infusions of radiolabeled angiotensins, allowing the quantification of uptake of blood-derived angiotensin in tissues, confirmed that the majority of tissue Ang I and II is produced at tissue sites, and not derived from blood (Schuijt and Danser 2002) . ACE is well-known to be abundantly expressed in virtually every tissue of the body, its main site being the surface of endothelial cells. Thus, its local synthesis is beyond doubt. Although angiotensinogen mRNA has been detected outside the liver, direct proof for actual angiotensinogen synthesis at important sites of local angiotensin production (e.g., heart and vessel wall) is lacking. For instance, the isolated perfused heart does not release angiotensinogen . Therefore, the majority of tissue angiotensinogen is probably of hepatic origin. The fact that angiotensinogen is neither internalized, nor binds to membranes, combined with the observation that angiotensinogen-synthesizing cells release angiotensinogen to the extracellular space (Klett et al 1993) , rather than storing it intracellularly, indicates that angiotensin generation must occurs extracellularly. Thus, tissue angiotensin generation is restricted to the interstitial space and/or the cell surface (Fig. 4) . Following a bilateral nephrectomy, tissue renin and angiotensin levels drop to levels at or below the detection limit (Campbell et al 1993; Danser et al 1994; Katz et al 1997) . This suggests that the majority of tissue renin is not locally produced, but kidney-derived, and that without renin, there is no angiotensin production. The presence of renin in cardiac membrane fractions (Danser et al 1994) suggested that circulating renin, in addition to its diffusion into the interstitial space (Katz et al 1997; van den Eijnden et al 2002) , may bind to renin-binding proteins or receptors at tissue sites. The recent discovery of several of such receptors, as discussed above, supports this concept. An interesting additional observation is that these receptors also bind prorenin, and that prorenin, upon binding, becomes catalytically active. In view of the much higher prorenin than renin levels, an attractive concept is that prorenin rather than renin contributes to tissue angiotensin generation. Studies with (pro)renin receptor blockers in diabetic rats confirmed this concept (Ichihara et al 2004) . Unexpectedly however, these blockers did not affect tissue angiotensin levels in control rats, although the prorenin levels of the latter rats were only \u22482-fold lower than those of the diabetic rats. Moreover, despite the fact that prorenin is still present in circulating blood after a nephrectomy (Danser et al 1994) , tissue angiotensin levels are close to zero. This suggests that, if prorenin contributes to tissue angiotensin production, this involves prorenin of renal rather than extrarenal origin. Currently, the only known difference between renal and extrarenal prorenin relates to their degree of glycosylation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 626, "end": 651, "text": "(Schuijt and Danser 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1421, "text": "(Klett et al 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1781, "text": "(Campbell et al 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1800, "text": "Danser et al 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1801, "end": 1817, "text": "Katz et al 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2025, "end": 2044, "text": "(Danser et al 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2153, "text": "(Katz et al 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2181, "text": "van den Eijnden et al 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 2728, "end": 2749, "text": "(Ichihara et al 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3051, "end": 3070, "text": "(Danser et al 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1631, "end": 1639, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "TISSUE ANGIOTENSIN GENERATION"}, {"text": "In vitro studies using the isolated perfused rat Langendorff heart fully confirmed the idea of renin and angiotensinogen uptake underlying tissue angiotensin production.

Findings on angiotensinogen were similar. Stopping the exposure to renin revealed a biphasic washout curve, in agreement with the concept that renin is not only present in extracellular fluid but also binds to receptors.

However, this type of Ang II generation is less efficient, because it does not result in a high level of regional AT receptor stimulation. In particular, Ang II generated by chymase (which is localized in the adventitia) will be subject to rapid metabolism in the interstitial space on its way to AT receptors (Schuijt et al 1999; de Lannoy et al 2001) and thus is less likely to result in a high regional AT receptor occupancy.
