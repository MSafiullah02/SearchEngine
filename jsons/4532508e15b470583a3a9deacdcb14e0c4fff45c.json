            "text": "Acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of child and adult morbidity and mortality throughout the world [Williams et al., 2002] . Determining the etiological diagnoses of patients who have respiratory symptoms remains a challenge both in the clinic and laboratory. Differentiating infections caused by influenza viruses from those caused by other respiratory viruses is essential for case management, as illustrated during the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic (A/H1N1p). Many definitions of influenza-like illness (ILI) have been used worldwide in influenza surveillance; however, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of such definitions significantly vary depending on the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses in the community [Boivin et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2011; Thursky et al., 2003] . The identification of the respiratory viruses that are responsible for influenza-like illness has been reported in many countries, and the percentage of positive swabs for at least one virus ranges from 32% to 65% [Bellei et al., 2008; Laguna-Torres et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2009; Buecher et al., 2010; Renois et al., 2010; Razanajatovo et al., 2011] . Influenza-like illness can be attributed to a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, adenoviruses (AdV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses (EVs), human rhinovirus (HRV), and parainfluenza viruses (PiVs) [Bellei et al., 2008; Laguna-Torres et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2009; Buecher et al., 2010; Renois et al., 2010; Razanajatovo et al., 2011] . Recently, several viruses have been associated with respiratory infections, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] , human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) [van der Hoek et al., 2004] , human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoVHKU1) [Woo et al., 2005] , as well as human bocavirus (HBoV) [Allander et al., 2005] . Three novel polyomaviruses, KIPyV, WUPyV, and MCPyV, have been detected recently in the respiratory tracts of humans; however, their pathogenicity remains controversial [Norja et al., 2007; Babakir-Mina et al., 2011] .",
