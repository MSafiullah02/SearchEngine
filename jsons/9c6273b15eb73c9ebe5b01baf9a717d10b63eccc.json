At time of writing (10 April, 2020) , the rapid spread of the virus throughout the world has resulted in over 1.6 million infections and over 95,000 deaths world-wide; in Australia, there have been 6,203 confirmed cases with 53 deaths, with a mortality rate of 0.85%, much less than the world average of around 6%. Given the ferocity and devastating effects on health care systems abroad, Australia has implemented a series of measures to reduce the rate of spread and prepare the health care system for the pandemic. This has included cancelling elective surgery, social distancing and a nation-wide shut down of non-essential services.",

One of the unintended consequences of the current pandemic has been a reduction in patients presenting for management of other chronic health conditions, in particular, cardiovascular health conditions. There is gathering data with respect to declining rates of patients presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) throughout the world, with a reduction of 70% in the north of Italy, 40% in Spain [1] , and up to 50% across the United States [2] . A number of theories have been suggested, including a tangible change in diet and lifestyle, whereby a reduction in aerobic exercise may reduce risk of acute plaque rupture [3] , whilst less psychological stress by staying at home may also reduce risks of acute coronary syndromes [4] . Furthermore with fewer cars on the roads, there may be a reduction in particulate air pollution [5] . However, worryingly, initial data from Hong Kong has suggested that patients are presenting later to hospital with STEMI, presumably in an effort to minimise interaction with the health care system, in an effort to avoid COVID-19 infection [6] . Furthermore, emerging data from New York, at time of writing the epicentre for the pandemic suggests that rates of out of hospital cardiac arrests have increased by 800% [7, 8] . Although some of these patients may be infected with SARS-CoV-2, almost certainly some patients with STEMI may be either hesitant to call for emergency services or else unable to access an increasingly thinly stretched medical service. These worrying findings suggest patients may be tolerating symptoms at home, and as such, complications of non-revascularised coronary disease may present in the coming weeks to months, including heart failure, arrhythmias and valvular heart disease.",

This suggests that patients may remain sceptical about attending health care professionals for some time following containment of the pandemic. A reduction in access to medical care is associated with a decline in health status [11] , whilst close cardiology follow-up in the outpatient setting is associated with improved prognosis and lower mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation [12] , chest pain [13] , acute coronary syndrome [14] and heart failure [15] . Furthermore, reports in the mainstream media of the-so far, unsubstantiated-risks of the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) in COVID-19 may lead to patients discontinuing antihypertensives.

Furthermore, anxiety related to contracting the disease, as well as spreading it to patients, colleagues, friends and family are all likely to result in a degree of \"physician burnout\" [22] . Physician burnout is associated with poorer patient outcomes [23] , and as such it is imperative strategies are implemented early to mitigate the effects of the psychosocial burden physicians will face. Early increase in health care worker provision by mobilising physicians not currently in the hospital sector will allow recovery time for staff, whilst considered rostering of lower acuity areas of the hospital in between caring for COVID-19 patients may also play a role. It is also anticipated that both medical and nursing staff may be redeployed to other departments and areas which need personnel during the surge.
