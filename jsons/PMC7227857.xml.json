            "text": "Infectious diseases caused by bacteria have increased dramatically in recent years. Despite many significant advances in antibacterial therapy, the widespread use and misuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, which is a serious threat to public health. On the other hand, tuberculosis (TB), still remains the leading cause of worldwide death among infectious diseases.1,2 In 2014, there were an estimated 9.6 million new TB cases: 5.4 million among men, 3.2 million among women and 1.0 million among children.3 Additionally, viral infections caused by the rapid emergence of antiviral drug resistant strains have become a serious threat globally.4 Many diseases are actually caused by the different members of DNA- and RNA-containing viruses. Among DNA-containing viruses, the herpes group of viruses, particularly herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) primarily causes encephalitis, stomatitis, ocular infections and HSV-2 primarily causes genital lesions, skin eruptions or cytomegalovirus is related with severe morbidity and mortality in patients at risk for disease because of immune system disabilities and varicella-zoster virus is the ethiological agent of chickenpox and shingles.5,6 Influenza (INF) viruses, parainfluenza-3 virus, alphaviruses (e.g. sindbis virus), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are examples of enveloped single-stranded RNA-containing viruses. VSV causes an economically important disease in horses and cattle.7 Both RSV and parainfluenza-3 virus are an important cause of respiratory tract infections.8,9",

Outer perimeter wells were filled with sterile water to prevent dehydration in experimental wells. Initial drug dilutions were prepared in either dimethyl sulfoxide or distilled deionized water, and subsequent twofold dilutions were performed in 0.1 mL of 7H9GC (no Tween 80) in the microplates. BACTEC 12B-passaged inocula were initially diluted 1:2 in 7H9GC, and 0.1 mL was added to wells. Subsequent determination of bacterial titers yield 1x106 CFU/mL in plate wells for H37Rv. Frozen inocula were initially diluted 1:20 in BACTEC 12B medium followed by a 1:50 dilution in 7H9GC. Addition of 1/10 mL to wells resulted in a final bacterial titers of 2.0x105 CFU/mL for H37Rv. Wells containing drug only were used to detect autofluorescence of compounds. Addition control wells consisted of bacteria only (B) and medium only (M). Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C. Starting at day 4 of incubation, 20 mL of 10x Alamar Blue solution (Alamar Biosciences/Accumed, Westlake, Ohio, USA) and 12.5 mL of 20% Tween 80 were added to one B well an done M well, and plates were reincubated 37\u00b0C. Wells were observed at 12 and 24 h for a color change from blue to pink and for a reading of \u226550.000 fluorescence units (FU). Fluorescence was measured in a Cytofluor II microplate fluorometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, Massachusetts, USA) in bottom-reading mode with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. If the B wells became pink by 24 h, reagent was added to the entire plate. If the well remained blue or \u00a350.000 FU was measured, additional M and B wells were tested daily until a color change occurred, at which time reagents were added to all remaining wells. Plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C, and results were recorded at 24 h post-reagent addition. Visual MICs were defined as the lowest concentration of drug that had prevented a color change. For fluorometric MICs, a background subtraction was performed on all wells with a mean of triplicate M wells. Percent inhibition was defined as 1-(test well FU/mean FU triplicate B wells) x 100. The lowest drug concentration effecting an inhibition of \u226590% was considered the MIC.",

The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration effecting a reduction in fluorescence of 90%, relative to controls. This value was determined from the dose-response curve as the IC90 using a curve fitting program. Any IC90 value of \u226410 \u00b5g/mL was considered \u201cActive\u201d for antitubercular activity. Compounds active in the initial screen were tested for IC50 in Vero cells. Cytotoxicity was determined from the dose-response curve as the IC50 using a curve fitting program.
