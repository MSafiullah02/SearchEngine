The pathological changes with viral-dependent distribution were compared 57 using necropsy specimens between two monkeys undergone challenge-rechallenge (M3 58 and M5) at 5 days post rechallenge (dpr, 33 dpi) and two monkeys undergone only 59 initial challenge (M0 at 5 dpi and M1 at 7 dpi). Clinical traits including body weight, 60 body temperature, chest X-ray, peripheral blood measurement, nasal/throat/anal swabs, 61 virus distribution, and pathological changes were examined at designated time points 62 (Figure 1 ). Weight loss ranged from 200 g to 400 g were found in four monkeys 63 4 undergone initial challenge (4/7) (Figure 2A) , and none of monkey's rectal temperature 64 was observed elevated (0/7) ( Figure 2B ). Reduced appetite and/or increased respiration 65 were common (6/7) but emerged transiently with a very short time. In regard to viral 66 dissemination, peak viral load (6.5 log10 RNA copies/mL) was detected in nasal swabs 67 and pharyngeal swabs at 3 dpi followed with gradual decline (Figure 2C and 2D) . Peak 68 viral load (5 log10 RNA copies/mL) could be detected using anal swabs at 3 dpi followed 69 with linearly declined to undetectable level at 14 dpi ( Figure 2E ). For all monkeys with 70 the initial challenge, white blood cell (WBC, 3.5-9.5\u00d710 9 /L), lymphocyte counts 71 (LYMP, 1.1-3.4\u00d710 9 /L) and neutrophil counts (NEUT, 1.8-6.4\u00d710 9 /L) fluctuated within 72 normal ranges. Comparing to the baseline, a slight yet significant reduction of WBC 73 and LYMP was observed posterior primary infection (*p<0.05, Figure 2F ). T 74 lymphocyte subsets including CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells maintained relatively 75 stable during the primary infectious stage ( Figure 2G ). Specific antibody against SARS-76 CoV-2 was gradually increased, leading to the concentration significantly higher at 21 77 dpi compared to that at 3 dpi (*p<0.05, Figure 2H ). Radiologically, bilateral ground-78 glass opacities were shown, indicating mild-to-moderate interstitial infiltration in 79 monkeys with pneumonia (Represented by M4, Figure 3A ). Using necropsy specimens, 80 viral RNA copies were detected in nose (10 6 to 10 8 copies/mL), pharynx (10 4 to 10 6 81 copies/mL), lung (10 3 to 10 7 copies/mL) and gut (10 4 to 10 6 copies/mL) ( Figure 3B , 82 upper panel). 83 Through HE staining, a mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia characterized by 84 widened alveolar septa, increased alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes in the 85 alveolar interstitium, and degenerated alveolar epithelia, and infiltrated inflammatory 86 cells were shown in lung from monkeys with primary infection. Amount of collagen 87 fiber could be also observed in the thickened alveolar interstitium in M0 and M1 88 5 monkeys by Modified Masson's Trichrome stain at 5 or 7 dpi (Figure 3C). Meanwhile, 89 the mucous membranes of trachea, tonsil, pulmonary lymph node, jejunum and colon 90 in M0 and M1 exhibited inflammatory cell infiltrations (Figure S1), and infiltration 91 with abundant CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells, macrophages and plasma cells in 92 lung were specified by immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) (Figure S2).

After all the experimentally infected monkeys were recovery from 312 the primary infection, four infected monkeys (M3 to M6) were intratracheally 313 rechallenged at 28 days post initial challenge (dpi) with the same dose of SARS-CoV-314 2 strain to ascertain the possibility of reinfection. Meanwhile, uninfected monkey (M0) 315 was also treated with SARS-CoV-2 as the model control in the second challenge, and 316 previously infected monkey (M2) was untreated again and continuously monitored as 317 the control. To compare the virus distribution and histopathological changes between 318 the initially infected monkeys and the reinfected monkeys, two monkeys per group (M0 319 and M1 in initial infection group, M3 and M5 in reinfection group) were euthanized 320 and necropsied at 5 (M0) or 7 (M1) dpi, 5 (M3 and M5) days post rechallenge (dpr), 321 respectively.
