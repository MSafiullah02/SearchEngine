Historically, trauma pneumonectomy (TP) mortality rates ranged between 53 and 100%. It is unclear if contemporary mortality rates have improved. Therefore, we evaluated outcomes associated with TP and limited lung resections (LLR) (i.e., lobectomy and segmentectomy) and aimed to identify predictors of mortality, hypothesizing that TP is associated with greater mortality versus LLR. We queried the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010-2016) and performed a multivariable logistic regression to determine the independent predictors of mortality in TLI patients undergoing TP versus LLR. TLI occurred in 287,276 patients. Of these, 889 required lung resection with 758 (85.3%) undergoing LLR and 131 (14.7%) undergoing TP. Patients undergoing TP had a higher median injury severity score (26.0 vs. 24.5, p = 0.03) but no difference in initial median systolic blood pressure (109 vs. 107 mmHg, p = 0.92) compared to LLR. Mortality was significantly higher for TP compared to LLR (64.9% vs 27.2%, p < 0.001). The strongest independent predictor for mortality was undergoing TP versus LLR (OR 4.89, CI 3.18-7.54, p < 0.001). TP continues to be associated with a higher mortality compared to LLR. Furthermore, TP is independently associated with a fivefold increased risk of mortality compared to LLR. Future investigations should focus on identifying parameters or treatment modalities that improve survivability after TP. We recommend that surgeons reserve TP as a last-resort management given the continued high morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure.",

The true incidence of traumatic lung injury (TLI) is unknown, as many patients with thoracic trauma die prior to arrival at the hospital [5, 6] . Among those presenting with thoracic trauma, pulmonary contusion is found in 30-75%, and pneumothorax and/or hemothorax in 20% of patients [2, 7] . Typically, most patients presenting with chest trauma require less invasive interventions, such as chest tube placement; however, in rare and severe cases, surgical resection may be necessary. TLI requiring surgical lung resection and the extent of lung resected are associated with increased morbidity and morality [8] . Overall, less than 0.1% of patients with chest trauma require any type of lung resection; however, patients who do undergo lung resection have significantly higher mortality rates [9] [10] [11] .",

Rates are 10-22% for a wedge resection, 27-70% for a lobectomy, and 53-100% for a trauma pneumonectomy (TP) [9, 12, 13] . Although less extensive lung resection techniques, such as wedge resections, may result in lower mortality rates, they may not always be feasible, especially when patients present with more severe lung injuries that are not amenable to this technique. More devastating injuries such as major hilar or bronchial injuries warrant more extensive lung resections, which are also associated with longer operative times and increased blood loss [9, 12, 14] . Previous studies comparing trauma patient outcomes associated with varying degrees of lung resection demonstrated that more extensive lung resections were associated with increased complications, and that the extent of lung resection is an independent predictor of mortality, even after adjusting for injury severity [9, 14] .",

Importantly, this retrospective analysis using seven years of data from TQIP demonstrated that TP continues to have a significantly higher mortality than that of LLR among patients with TLI requiring surgical intervention. Furthermore, TP was identified as the strongest risk factor for mortality in TLI patients. Although we reported that patients who underwent TP had shorter LOS and ventilator days compared to LLR, these patients had higher in-hospital mortality rates and most likely died early in their hospital course, thereby skewing these data. In addition, the current mortality rate of TP appears relatively unchanged compared to previous reports, thereby reinforcing the need for future research on this highly lethal operation. The prevalence of lung resections in thoracic trauma was previously reported to be 0.08% with higher rates after penetrating (1.3%) compared with blunt injury (0.03%) [9] . Huh et al. performed a single-center retrospective review between 1984 and 1999 and reported mortality rates of 69.7% for TP and 35.0% for lobectomy [11] . Similarly, a review of 669 TLI patients undergoing lung resection identified in the National Trauma Database by Martin et al. reported mortality rates of 62% for TP and 38% for lobectomy. Even in isolated TLI, the mortality rate for TP was 53% and 27% for lobectomy [9] . More than a decade after these reports, we demonstrated that patients undergoing TP had a mortality rate of 65% and 27% for LLR.",

            "text": "Although the mortality rate for TP remains high and similar to historical reports, our analysis revealed that trends for TP and overall lung resection in TLI patients remained stable between 2010 and 2016. The extent of lung resection is associated with longer operative times, increased blood loss, and higher perioperative morbidity and mortality [9, 12, 14] . For example, pulmonary tractotomy preserves lung tissue in patients requiring emergent thoracotomy and presenting with penetrating or blunt through-and-through pulmonary parenchyma injury not involving hilar structures [11, 17, 18] . For patients with hilar or irreparable main bronchus injuries where TP may not be avoided, rapid stapled pneumonectomy may improve outcomes, as the survival of the patient may be related to the rapidity by which the hilum is compressed and the lung is resected [18] . Another technique reported in other studies is twisting the pulmonary hilum in central lung injuries to gain rapid control of hemorrhage and postpone pneumonectomy [11, 19] . Nonetheless, this study emphasizes the clinical implication that lung-sparing techniques should be performed whenever possible. The use of DCS techniques have successfully improved survival rates in severe abdominal, vascular, and orthopedic trauma, and have recently been applied to those with thoracic injuries [17, 20, 21] . However, there are few singlecenter studies with small patient sample sizes that describe the impact of DCS on outcomes in patients with TLI [19, 21, 22] . Studies that report lower overall mortality rates (~ 24%) associated with DCS still find the highest mortality rates in patients who undergo TP (up to 67%), compared to less invasive surgeries such as lobectomy or wedge resection [19, 21] . This highlights that the cause of death after TP is different than the cause of death after DCS for abdominal hemorrhage and it is important for the clinician to understand that the mortality associated with TP may not necessarily be related to the procedure alone.",

            "text": "Poor outcomes associated with TP may also be in part due to cardiopulmonary stress. Previous animal studies have demonstrated that pneumonectomy results in an acute increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) due to an increase in pulmonary artery pressure without significant change in cardiac index [24] . This is thought to be mediated by cytokine release associated with hemorrhagic shock and blood product transfusion after lung resection [25] [26] [27] . This causes decreased compliance and increased afterload in the right ventricle (RV), which leads to a rapid onset of RV failure, decreased cardiac output, tissue hypoxia, refractory shock, and death. Indeed, there were significantly more patients who developed cardiac arrest in the TP group than the LLR group. These physiological changes may be exaggerated in trauma patients, who are already suffering from other extreme physiologic derangements. Therefore, interventions that minimize postoperative increases in PVR may improve survivability in TP patients. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has been demonstrated to selectively dilate the pulmonary vasculature, decrease PVR, and improve oxygenation and ventilation perfusion with minimal effects on systemic hemodynamics [24, 26, 28, 29] . A blinded randomized controlled trial on sheep with hemorrhagic shock demonstrated that iNO could decrease right ventricle afterload, while preserving biventricular function and, therefore, may be a useful adjunct for patients undergoing TP [28] . Future large prospective trials using iNO or other novel treatments for humans undergoing TP are needed to try and mitigate the persistently high mortality associated with this surgery.",

Our data were restricted to fields available in the TQIP database. For example, lobectomy and segmentectomy were grouped together as LLR, while they have been analyzed separately in previous studies. Missing pertinent data fields include the indication for operation, extent of injury (i.e., American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) lung injury grade), surgical technique (i.e., hilar twist, clamp resection, staple resection), intraoperative physiology, intraoperative surgical findings (i.e., cardiac injury or great vessel injury), surgical duration, intraoperative blood loss, percentage of lung resected, and whether ischemic pre-conditioning was utilized. In addition, we were unable to include perioperative data such as fluid resuscitation, ventilatory management, and hemodynamic support with vasopressors. The timing of death and cause of mortality were also not available. Furthermore, we were unable to determine if patients who went for re-incision of recent thoracotomy site were planned or unplanned cases returning to the operating room. Lastly, we were unable to evaluate the laterality in this patient population, which may change outcomes as a right pneumonectomy has been associated with a fivefold increase in mortality compared to a left pneumonectomy in elective thoracic lung resections [23, 30, 31] . These limitations could ideally be addressed in a prospective study or with data containing the aforementioned missing information in future versions of TQIP.",
