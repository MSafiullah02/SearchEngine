            "text": "Quantitative infection risk assessment can serve as a useful tool in epidemic modeling, parametric studies on disease transmission and evaluating the effectiveness of infection control measures. It describes the infection risk of an individual or a population to an infectious disease quantitatively. Infection risk is expressed by a probability of infection between 0 and 1. By comparing infection risks, the influence of different environmental factors on disease transmission and the effectiveness of different infection control measures can be evaluated. Quantitative infection risk assessment can also be used in epidemiological studies such as outbreak investigations. Currently, there are two approaches to quanti-tative infection risk assessment of respiratory diseases, which can be transmitted via the airborne route: the Wells-Riley model and the dose-response model. The Wells-Riley equation was developed by Riley and colleagues in an epidemiological study on a measles outbreak (Riley et al., 1978) . The equation is based on the concept of \u00d4quantum of infection\u00d5 as proposed by Wells (1955) and is therefore termed the Wells-Riley equation. The Wells-Riley model has been extensively used in analyzing ventilation strategy and its association to airborne infections in clinical environments (e.g., Escombe et al., 2007; Fennelly and Nardell, 1998; Nardell et al., 1991) . The dose-response relationship is used to describe the effect on organisms from the exposure to different doses of chemicals, drugs, Abstract Infection risk assessment is very useful in understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and in predicting the risk of these diseases to the public. Quantitative infection risk assessment can provide quantitative analysis of disease transmission and the effectiveness of infection control measures. The Wells-Riley model has been extensively used for quantitative infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases in indoor premises. Some newer studies have also proposed the use of dose-response models for such purpose. This study reviews and compares these two approaches to infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases. The Wells-Riley model allows quick assessment and does not require interspecies extrapolation of infectivity. Dose-response models can consider other disease transmission routes in addition to airborne route and can calculate the infectious source strength of an outbreak in terms of the quantity of the pathogen rather than a hypothetical unit. Spatial distribution of airborne pathogens is one of the most important factors in infection risk assessment of respiratory disease. Respiratory deposition of aerosol induces heterogeneous infectivity of intake pathogens and randomness on the intake dose, which are not being well accounted for in current risk models. Some suggestions for further development of the risk assessment models are proposed. radiation, bio-agents, or other stressors. Risk assessment models based on the dose-response relationship are called dose-response models. Originally, doseresponse models were mainly used for risk assessment of hazardous chemicals. They were then developed for assessing the infection risk of foodborne and waterborne pathogens (Haas, 1983) . Some newer studies have proposed to use dose-response models for assessing the infection risk of airborne-transmissible pathogens (e.g., Armstrong and Haas, 2007a; Nicas, 1996; Sze To et al., 2008) . This article reviews the fundamental theories, formulations, model developments, and modifications of these two approaches. The strengths and limitations of the two approaches to infection risk assessment as well as to outbreak investigations are compared. Suggestions on further development of risk assessment models regarding their limitations are proposed.",

Airborne respiratory pathogens can be generated from expiration actions and other activities that introduce pathogen-laden aerosols into the air. Pathogens released from the infectious source must reach the target infection site of the receptor to commence the infection. Even after the pathogen has successfully reached the target infection site, it must survive the immune defenses of the receptor organism to induce infection. A number of influencing factors affect this process and the outcome. They are listed in Table 1 . These factors add complexities to the exposure and risk assessment of pathogenic microorganisms. Many of them are not well-understood, especially the pathogen-host interactions. As a result, statistics and probabilities are often employed to formulate quantitative infection risk assessment models.",

In deterministic models, each individual is hypothesized to have an inherent tolerance dose toward the infectious agent (Haas et al., 1999) . When a receptor organism intakes a dose of pathogens equivalent to or exceeding his/her tolerance dose, infection will occur. Lower than this tolerance dose, the receptor organism will remain uninfected. Following this hypothesis, the model can determine whether an individual will be infected or not under a certain intake dose. On the contrary, stochastic models do not determine whether an individual will acquire infection or not under a certain intake dose. Instead, the models estimate the probability of acquiring the infection under the intake dose. More details on these two concepts will be discussed in further sections.",

When a population intakes a dose lower than the threshold dose, none of the individuals would acquire the infection, i.e., the infection risk would be zero. It should be noticed that the threshold dose is different from the tolerance dose in the deterministic models (Haas et al., 1999) . Threshold dose is the minimum amount of pathogens required to initiate infection. When the intake dose exceeds the threshold dose, there will be a non-zero probability of infection. Tolerance dose is a deterministic indicator. When an individual receives an intake dose exceeding his/her tolerance dose, that individual will be infected. Examples and the assumptions of threshold models will be discussed in further sections. Wells-Riley model: the quantum of infection and the Poisson probability distribution Wells (1955) proposed a hypothetical infectious dose unit: the quantum of infection. A quantum is defined as the number of infectious airborne particles required to infect the person and may consist of one or more airborne particles. These particles are assumed to be randomly distributed throughout the air of confined spaces. Riley et al. (1978) considered the intake dose of airborne pathogens in terms of the number of quanta to evaluate the probability of escaping the infection as a modification of the Reed-Frost equation (Abbey, 1952) . Together with the Poisson probability distribution describing the randomly distributed discrete infectious particles in the air, the Wells-Riley equation was derived as follows:",

The infectivity term describes the probability of each infectious particle to initiate the infection. It should be noticed that in the first interpretation, a unity infectivity term implies that the host is completely vulnerable to the pathogen. This will make the Wells-Riley equation only suitable for diseases such as tuberculosis, in which the definition of tuberculosis infection fulfills this condition (Huebner et al., 1993) . A unity infectivity term also indicates that one quantum is equal to one infectious particle/ pathogen and makes the model deterministic, because the individual is determined to be infected if his/her intake dose is equal to or greater than one pathogen. The first interpretation has also assumed that all inhaled infectious particles will successfully deposit on the target infection site in the respiratory tracts, which is not correct in general. Adopting the second interpretation, the equation is applicable to many diseases and it is a stochastic model. Respiratory deposition of infectious particles is implicitly considered in the calculated quanta generation rate. The calculated Dispersion and distribution of airborne pathogens How airborne pathogens disperse and distribute in the room air governs the exposure levels of the susceptible persons. The spatial distribution of airborne pathogens depends on the proximity to the infectious source, ventilation, and the geometry of the premises. The susceptible people would generally have different exposure levels and hence different degrees of infection risk. Assuming a uniform airborne pathogen distribution may cause significant error in the assessment (Noakes and Sleigh, 2008) . Ventilation strategy Airborne pathogens can be dispersed to different locations by airflow. The ventilated airflow pattern has strong correlation to the spreading of airborne transmissible diseases (Li et al., 2007) . The spatial distribution of infectious particles is very dependent on the airflow pattern. Infectious particles can be removed from the air by ventilation dilution, which depends on the ventilation rate. Survival of pathogen Pathogens may lose viability to cause infection by biological decay during the airborne stage, which is a sinking mechanism for respiratory pathogens. Airborne survival of pathogens often depends on the temperature and humidity (e.g., Schaffer et al., 1976) . Aerosol size Expiratory aerosols and many other bioaerosols are polydispersed. The transport of aerosols depends on their aerodynamic size. Therefore, the dispersion of pathogen-laden aerosols is dependent on aerodynamic size and the exposure levels to these aerosols usually have spatial variations. The deposition loss of infectious particles also depends on their aerosol size .",

Following the tolerance dose concept, infectious dose data are interpreted as the dose of pathogens that exceeds the tolerance dose of a portion of the population. For example, 50% infectious dose (ID 50 ) exceeds the tolerance dose of half of the susceptible population. When each person in a susceptible population intakes a dose of the pathogen equal to ID 50 , half of the people will be infected. When the frequency distribution of this tolerance dose is known, the infection risk of a certain intake dose can be assessed. Figure 1 illustrates this idea. The cumulative curve describes the doseresponse relationship. When each member of a susceptible population receives the same dose of pathogens, the infection risk is equal to the (cumulative) relative frequency of infection at this dose. The tolerance dose concept is biologically plausible in the sense that the immune status and the host\u00d5s sensitivity to the pathogen vary between individuals as do their tolerance doses. In addition, some infection symptoms may only be observed after the host acquires a certain amount of pathogen in the body. However, it is not biologically plausible in the sense that the pathogens would inherently be assumed to be acting cooperatively, by which infection is the consequence of their joint action (Armitage et al., 1965; Haas, 1983) .

Although the threshold dose concept is not the same as the tolerance dose concept, threshold models also inherently assume that the pathogens act cooperatively (Rubin, 1987) . This assumption is not biologically plausible, as pathogen attacks on an organ or cell are spontaneous and independent actions and they do not have \u00d4joint actions\u00d5 or \u00d4cooperative attacks\u00d5. In addition, after pathogens successfully attack the organ or cell, they may quickly replicate inside the host body and eventually reach a critical amount sufficient to provoke infection symptoms in the host. There is sufficient evidence to support the argument that only a single pathogen is required to commence infection of some diseases, including tuberculosis and smallpox (Nicas et al., 2004; Wells, 1955) . However, some arguments suggest that threshold models do provide more accurate assessment results for some diseases, especially under low intake doses. Some experimental infection studies have observed threshold dose among the test animals (e.g., Cafruny and Hovinen, 1988; Dean et al., 2005) .

However, readers should be aware that when the quanta generation rate, q, is backward calculated from an outbreak case by Equation 1, removal by ventilation is implicitly assumed to be the sole sink mechanism for the airborne pathogen during that outbreak case. Therefore, the calculated q has already implicitly considered the deposition loss of infectious particles and the viability loss of pathogens in the airborne state of that outbreak case. If this quanta generation rate is used in Equation 12, the effects of these influencing factors would be considered twice and would lead to underestimation of the infection risk. To consider these two influencing factors using the Wells-Riley model, knowledge of the deposition and viability losses during the outbreak case is required. By substituting these two parameters into Equation 12, a quanta generation rate of the disease without implicit consideration of ventilation removal, deposition and viability losses as airborne pathogen sink mechanisms during the outbreak can be obtained. Risk assessors can then perform risk assessment with consideration of these influencing factors with Equation 12 using this quanta generation rate. Likewise, if the place of an outbreak case is equipped with ultraviolet irradiation or air filtration devices or the occupants have used respiratory protection, using Equation 1 to calculate the quanta generation rate during the outbreak will obtain a q implicitly considering these influencing factors. It is inappropriate to use such quanta generation rates for parametric studies of these factors.

In such measurements, tracer gas is released from the locations of the infectors and the concentrations of the tracer gas at the locations of each susceptible person are then measured. The amount of exhaled breath inhaled by a susceptible person can be calculated by the measured concentrations and the released concentration. This parameter can also be obtained numerically by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A numerical model of the premises is constructed. Gas surrogate is injected into the model at the locations of the infectors and its dispersion is simulated numerically. Spatial distribution of gas concentration is then obtained and the amount of exhaled breath inhaled by the susceptible person at different locations can be calculated. Some risk assessment studies have used these approaches to incorporate spatial variation into infection risk (e.g., Gao et al., 2008; Tung and Hu, 2008) . These approaches can provide more realistic results, but they are more timeconsuming than using the multiple box or multi-zone model.",

The concept has also been found to be feasible in assessing the risk of pathogenic microorganisms. The dose-response models have been widely adopted in quantitative risk assessment of infectious diseases transmitted via foodborne and waterborne routes and is recommended by the World Health Organization (2003). In waterborne and foodborne infections, as the contaminated water or food is consumed by ingestion, the pathogenic microorganism can directly reach the gastrointestinal region and hence the target site of infection. However, when assessing the risk of airborne infection, not all inhaled airborne pathogens will reach or be retained in the target infection site. Thus, the respiratory deposition of aerosols has to be considered. Exposure to airborne pathogens has to be assessed when estimating the intake dose. Exposure assessment is recognized by the National Academy of Sciences as one of the four components of the risk assessment paradigm for human health effects (National Academy of Sciences, 1983) . Once the exposure level to the airborne pathogen is known, the intake dose can be estimated from the pulmonary ventilation rate and deposition fraction of the aerosols. The probability of infection can then be predicted using the dose-response equation. Therefore, it is critical to obtain a realistic exposure level in the susceptibles of airborne pathogens when adopting dose-response risk assessment models.",

Readers may notice that the equation is similar to the Wells-Riley equation with the quanta generation rate q replaced by Gb and it is also similar to the exponential dose-response equation with r equal to 1. The equation implicitly assumes that infection will occur if there is one bacillus successfully deposited on the alveolar region. Infectious particles are also assumed to have a Poisson distribution in the air. As a result, the probability of infection equals 0.63 when the exponential term equals 1. The first assumption delineates the host as completely vulnerable to the pathogen. Equation 16 is describing the probability of the susceptible person being exposed to the tuberculosis bacilli, i.e., getting a positive skin test. As having a positive skin test equates to tuberculosis infection (Huebner et al., 1993) , Equation 16 is adequate for use to describe the probability of tuberculosis infection. For other diseases, the assumption that the host is completely vulnerable to the pathogen may not be appropriate. Nicas\u00d5s work has shown the possibility of using the dose-response model in assessing the infection risk of disease transmitted via airborne route. Nicas and his colleagues modified the equation by expressing the infectious source strength term, G, as a multiple of cough frequency, pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid and the volume of expiratory droplets introduced into the air in a cough (Nicas et al., 2005) . Other sinking mechanisms for the airborne pathogen were also considered in the modified equation with a formulation similar to Equation 11. These two dose-response models utilize the steady-state and well-mixed assumption on the airborne pathogen concentration.",

The spatial distribution of infectious particles can be reflected by this parameter. It is tedious and time-consuming to model every cough during the exposure time interval to obtain v(x, t) at different locations. An alternative approach is to model the transport of the expiratory droplets after a single cough to obtain v(x, t) at different locations and then to multiply the right-hand side of the equation by the total number of coughs during the exposure time interval.

            "text": "Droplet and indirect contact transmission. Many respiratory infectious diseases can be transmitted via the airborne route and many of them can also be transmitted via droplet and indirect contact routes. It is also believed that the airborne mode may not be the major or only route of transmission for some respiratory diseases, such as SARS and influenza. Indirect contact transmission may be an important route of transmission for many respiratory pathogens (Beggs, 2003; Boone and Gerba, 2007) . The result of risk assessment will be incomplete without considering these transmission routes. Dose-response models can assess the infection risk of these exposure pathways provided that the intake dose of the pathogen via these transmission routes can be estimated. Droplet transmission occurs when pathogens are carried in relatively large expiratory droplets. Unlike small expiratory aerosols, which can remain airborne for a long time and disperse over long distances, these expiratory aerosols can only travel short distances before settling. Under the definitions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2003) , disease transmission via expiratory aerosols with sizes greater than 5 lm are in the droplet mode and with sizes smaller than or equal to 5 lm are in the airborne mode. However, studies found that expiratory droplet nuclei with sizes up to about 20 lm may also travel long distances similar to these aerosols with sizes smaller than or equal to 5 lm, depending on the airflow pattern and ventilation strategy (Chao and Wan, 2006; . Therefore, a more rigorous approach to perform the dose-response infection risk assessment is not to distinguish into the airborne mode or the droplet mode, but directly split the exposure level into different aerodynamic size ranges for the infectious particles, such as Equation 18. Other dose-response models described in this article can also assess the infection risk via droplet transmission when the aerodynamic size-dependent factors are incorporated and an exposure assessment method that includes spatial variation of aerosol exposure levels is adopted. Other than directly inhaling aerosolized respiratory pathogens, susceptibles may also be exposed to them via contacting surfaces contaminated by the deposited pathogens, as the conjunctiva and nasal mucous membrane can be portals of entry for some respiratory pathogens such as the measles and influenza viruses. When infectious particles are deposited on solid surfaces, these surfaces will become fomites. People contacting these contaminated surfaces may then deliver the pathogen to their eyes or nasal mucous membranes and may become infected. The first study assessing the infection risk via indirect contact transmission was performed by Nicas and Sun (2006) . A Markov chain model was used to estimate the intake dose of pathogens via indirect contact and also via other exposure pathways. When the intake dose is known, the infection risk can be assessed by the doseresponse model. Their model assumes a steady-state pathogen load on contaminated surfaces, in which the rate of introducing the pathogens onto the surface equals the loss rate of the pathogen on the surface because of decay. This assumption is adequate for some pathogens with a fast or medium decay rate on the surface. Some pathogens will survive on solid surfaces for days or even weeks (Walther and Ewald, 2004 ) and at such a slow decay rate, the steady-state pathogen load will take a long time to reach. In this case, the error associated with this assumption will be large, especially for a short and medium exposure time interval. Nicas and Best (2008) have proposed an analytical model assessing the infection risk via indirect contact transmission by considering an average pathogen load on hand over the concerned exposure time interval. Wan et al. (2009) have also developed a mathematical model describing the process of delivering pathogen to the mucous membranes via indirect contact transmission. The model also estimates the intake dose via indirect contact transmission. Their model can incorporate the non-steady-state pathogen load condition. It assumes that the decay of the pathogen on the contaminated surface is insignificant during the exposure time interval. Therefore, the equation is suitable for the case when the pathogen has a slow decay rate on the contaminated surface. In contrast, Nicas and Sun\u00d5s model should be used when the pathogens have a fast or medium decay rate on the contaminated surface. With pathogens that can survive on inanimate surfaces for days or even weeks, the contaminated surfaces can serve as reservoirs for the pathogens up to weeks without effective disinfection. These fomites can impose potential infection risk to susceptible people for a long period of time, even after the source of the infectious particles has been removed. In this case, indirect contact transmission is the only exposure pathway to the susceptible people. Their model can also estimate the intake dose in this scenario. Table 3 shows these models. With the estimated intake dose, the infection risk can be assessed using the dose-response model. To assess the combined infection risk via multiple exposure pathways, the simplest way is to sum up all the intake doses from different exposure pathways and then substitute into the doseresponse model. However, as discussed in Table 1 , pathogens have heterogeneous infectivity in different regions of the respiratory tract. Using a summed intake dose from different exposure pathways in doseresponse assessment will only allow a single or a single set of fitting parameters that consider all the pathogens to have homogeneous infectivity. Essentially, pathogens encased in small aerosols will generally infect the lower respiratory tract, whereas pathogens encased in large aerosols will mainly infect the upper respiratory tract, and pathogens acquired via indirect contact will primarily infect the mucous membranes. Risk assessors should separate the intake dose for different exposure pathways and use different fitting parameters to obtain more realistic risk assessment results, unless the available infectious dose data are insufficient. To consider multiple intake doses from different exposure pathways, the dose-response equations would need to be reformulated. The exponential model is modified as follows:",

The exposure level and hence the infection risk to respiratory pathogens are always expected to have spatial variation. As observed in many outbreaks associated with infectious respiratory diseases, the infection cases are often distributed with obvious proximity relationship to the index case (e.g., Gustafson et al., 1982; Marsden, 2003) . Spatial distribution of the infectious particles is an important consideration in risk assessment of infectious respiratory diseases. When the well-mixed assumption is adopted, the spatial variation of infectious particles distribution is Review of the Wells-Riley and dose-response models ignored and all the susceptible people have the same infection risk. This approach may cause underestimation of infection risk for the susceptible people in close proximity to the infectious source (Noakes and Sleigh, 2008) . Newer models allow both approaches to consider the spatial variation of infection risk in the assessment. However, as the Wells-Riley models rely on backward calculated infectivity and infectious source strength (the quanta generation rate), there is currently no method to estimate the infectious source strength from an outbreak other than the well-mixed approach. When the infectious source strength term is backward calculated from an outbreak using the wellmixed assumption, the influences of the geometry of the premises, the airflow pattern, and the location of the infectious source on the spatial distribution of the infectious particles are implicitly considered in that infectious source strength. Using this infectious source strength in the risk assessments, even if the risk assessor has used a model that can incorporate spatial variation in exposure levels, these influencing factors cannot be explicitly adjusted and will become errors. Therefore, the errors associated with the well-mixed assumption still persist even though the risk assessor uses a modified Wells-Riley model that can consider spatial effects in the assessment. Dose-response models do not rely on backward calculation of infectivity and infectious source strength from outbreaks. Therefore, using the dose-response models that can consider spatial effects in the assessment can avoid those errors.",

The randomness induced by air turbulence consists of two components: the randomness in the pathogen distribution in air and the randomness of respiratory deposition of the inhaled pathogen. The former component can be described by Poisson probability as shown in some of the current risk models. For the latter component, if the respiratory deposition fraction is multiplied to the inhaled dose, the deposited dose will be the expected value and this randomness is not fully adjusted. When a person inhales an amount of N* pathogens and the respiratory deposition fraction of the aerosols is b*, an amount of b*N* pathogens is most likely to be successfully deposited on his/her respiratory tract. However, it is also possible to have zero pathogen successfully deposited on his/her respiratory tract if the person has lottery-winning good luck or having all N* pathogens successfully deposited on his/her respiratory tract if the person has very bad luck. Therefore, there should be a binomial probability distribution to describe this randomness. Taking the exponential (2008) where E m is the dose of pathogen delivered to the mucous membrane, c h is the transfer efficiency of the pathogen from the surface to the hand after a contact, c m is the transfer efficiency of the pathogen from the hand to the mucous membrane after a contact, f h is the frequency of hand-to-contaminated surface contact, f m is the frequency of hand-to-mucous membrane contact, A s is the average contaminated surface area touched per hand contact, t o is the concerned time interval, C s is the pathogen load per area of the contaminated surface, and u is the decay rate of pathogen on hand.",

This may cause errors in risk assessment results. Quanta generation rates and the fitting parameters of dose-response equation describe the infectivity of the pathogen. Pathogen-host interaction is implicitly considered by these parameters. Although the pathogen-host interaction has not been well-understood and quantified, it is reasonable to assume that the interaction between a particular species of pathogen and a particular species of host is rather consistent in different scenarios, while the variation in the individual host\u00d5s immune status is either reflected statistically in the formulation of the model or is implicitly considered in the infectivity terms. However, other influencing factors that are being implicitly considered by the quanta generation rate or by the fitting parameters may have greater variation across different cases. The backward calculated quanta generation rate also does not distinguish whether the infection cases are caused by airborne, droplet, or indirect contact transmission or by a combination of all three, but it assumes that all infection cases are caused by airborne infection. This may also induce implicit error in the backward calculated quanta generation rate. Spatial heterogeneity, pathogen survivability, deposition loss of infectious particles, and other influencing factors are also implicitly considered in the backward calculated quanta generation rate. These factors always vary from case to case. The calculated quanta generation rate value will inherit all these influencing factors in that particular outbreak case. With so many influencing factors implicitly considered by a single parameter, the caseto-case variations and hence the implicit errors would be huge. As reviewed in one study, the quanta generation rate of tuberculosis calculated from different outbreaks ranged from 1.25 to 30,840 quanta/h . Other than the variation of infectious source strengths, this huge variation is also likely to be attributed by these implicit errors. In doseresponse models, as many of these influencing factors can be considered explicitly, there are fewer implicit errors in general.",

This hypothetical infectious dose unit offers convenience for risk assessment but provides less information regarding the outbreak, as it cannot distinguish the pathogen emission rate from the path-ogen\u00d5s infectivity. When the quanta generation rates of two diseases are compared, epidemiologists cannot ascertain whether the one with a greater quanta generation rate is more infective than the other or that the infector has shed more pathogens during the outbreak than the other one. Infectivity of different pathogens can be easily compared by the infectious dose unit, in which the quantity of the pathogens can be directly compared. Dose-response model can also be used to calculate the infectious source strength of an outbreak. The infectious source strength can be expressed in terms of the quantity of the pathogen rather than a hypothetical unit. To demonstrate this idea, we selected an influenza outbreak during an air flight in Australia in 1999 (Marsden, 2003) as an example. As shown in Although interspecies extrapolation can be used in adopting these data to humans, using extrapolated animal data may still not fully adjust the difference of pathogen-host interactions between the two species. Risk assessors should be aware that the respiratory deposition of animals differs with that of humans (Asgharian et al., 1995) and this difference should also be considered when performing interspecies extrapolations. Some pathogens are too dangerous to be aerosolized to conduct infection experiments, such as the SARS coronavirus. Their infectious dose data are often unavailable.",

If the infectious dose data are not obtained from the inhalation of aerosolized pathogens, for example, by intranasal inoculation, it would not contain the uncertainty of respiratory deposition. In this case, the fitting parameters should be calculated by a dose-response equation without considering the binomial probability distribution, such as Equation 6.

Knowing the amount of pathogens shed during an outbreak would provide further information to understand the transmission of disease. of infectious dose data Dose-response models rely on infectious dose data to derive the dose-response relationship. A number of infectious dose values of a disease are usually needed to determine which dose-response equation best fits the infectious dose data for model selection. Dose-response models such as Equations 18, 21-23 also require a number of infectious dose values, for example, the infectious dose values of the pathogen suspended in aerosols of different sizes. Therefore, a rich infectious dose database is necessary. Infectious dose data are often obtained by experimental infections but, for many pathogens, only animal data are available.",
