The index ranges from 0 to 100, and assesses six core elements: prevention, detection and reporting, response, health system, compliance with norms and risk of infectious disease outbreaks. 2 A higher GHSI indicates better preparedness.",

Data on countries' median age and proportion of females in 2019 were sourced from the United Nations population database. 4 We analysed the association between GHSI and COVID-19 burden, represented by numbers of tests confirmed cases and deaths per million people per day since the first confirmed case in each country. First, we plotted GHSI against natural log transformed values of these outcomes (to provide more symmetrical distributions). Secondly, we used a generalised linear model (GLM) to determine the association between GHSI and confirmed cases and deaths per million people per day, with adjustment for testing rate, population median age and proportion of females.",

            "text": "The findings of our study were unexpected. First, no association was noted between GHSI and testing rate, despite that GHSI should serve as a surrogate for healthcare capacity, including COVID-19 testing. Effective pandemic response requires significant investment in testing, with adequate training of healthcare workers in testing, as well as sufficient supply of PPE and testing kits. 5 In addition, effective and widespread dissemination of information to the general population regarding testing criteria assists case detection. 5 Secondly, the associations between GHSI and COVID-19 cases and deaths were positive, meaning that the GHSI can reflect a country's capacity to deal with epidemics or pandemics, but in the opposite manner than intended. No doubt there was confounding by increased globalisation among more developed countries (with higher GHSI). Increased exposure to foreigners travelling for the purposes of tourism, business and use of healthcare is likely to increase the risk of new infectious pathogens being introduced. Similarly, mass migration contributes to disruption of local bacterial and viral environments. 2 Furthermore, the rarity of pandemics in conjunction with false reassurance from a high GHSI may have contributed to more lenient adherence to infection control mechanisms in recent years. 6 The intent of the GHSI is noble, and the findings of our study should not discourage future endeavours to gauge capacity to respond to pandemics. However, as the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the value of assessing the capacity of countries to manage infectious outbreaks individually is redundant. This interconnectedness extends beyond social, political, and business interactions to pathogenic environments. Consequently, identifying and controlling spread of newly arising infectious agents is only as effective as the practices within the poorest performing countries.",
