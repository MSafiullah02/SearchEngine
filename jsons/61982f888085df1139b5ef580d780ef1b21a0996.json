These classes of polynucleotides have the ability to target an mRNA in the cell and change its expression levels predominantly by modulating mRNA turnover or translation. Although RNAi mediators are typically active once in the correct cellular compartment, they are intrinsically difficult to get into the cell from an external source because of their susceptibility to nucleases, relatively large molecular weight, negatively charged backbone, and their inability to efficiently penetrate membranes without an aid. While technologies such as lipids and membrane penetrating polypeptides are widely available to aid delivery of RNAi mediators into cells in culture, techniques to efficiently deliver RNAi mediators into animal organs are not as easily obtainable. Delivering RNA into cells in animal tissues is much more complicated as target cells are typically deeply embedded in dense and complex microenvironments.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 218, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Although numerous techniques have been developed to systemically deliver RNAi mediators into some of the major organ systems, 2-5 these techniques lack efficiency in specifically targeting particular genes in cell types of interest.

One of the first successful gene reductions of Apolipoprotein B in the jejunum and liver utilized cholesterol conjugated siRNA. 15 Studies utilizing modified siRNA 10, 16, 17 along with liposomal formulations 18 continue to be main strategies in liver targeting. Wolfrum et al. 19 found that efficient uptake of siRNA conjugates depends on interactions with lipoprotein particles, receptors and transmembrane proteins. Their study showed that high-density lipoprotein directed siRNA into liver, gut, and kidney whereas low-density lipoprotein targeted siRNA primarily into the liver. These results illustrate nicely that effective uptake via a common mechanism can be exploited to optimize delivery. In terms of delivery into the respiratory epithelium, unformulated siRNAs were shown to be efficacious against respiratory infections caused by 20 and severe acute respiratory syndrome 21 in primate and mouse models. Bitko et al. 20 found nasally administered siRNA at a dose of 3 mg/kg reduced RSV and Parainfluenza virus (PIV) titers by 99% without inducing an interferon response. However, combinational therapies using an excess of one siRNA over the other had an inhibitory effect, most likely a result of RNAi protein mediator competition. Using 10-40 mg/kg accumulated doses of siRNA in rhesus macaque severe acute respiratory syndrome models, Li et al. were able to reduce coronavirus induced fever, viral titer, and acute diffuse alveoli damage without any signs of siRNA induced toxicity.

The targeting agent contains the human transferrin protein. The cationic polymer (cyclodextran) interacts electrostatically with anionic siRNA to assemble into nanocomplexes below approximately 100 nm in diameter that protect the siRNA from nuclease degradation in serum. The siRNA-containing nanocomplexes are targeted to cells that over-express the TfR.

Inside the cell, chemistry built into the polymer achieves unpackaging of the siRNA from the nanocomplex, permitting it to function via RNA interference. 46 The surface-modifying agents have terminal adamantane groups that form inclusion complexes with the cyclodextrin and contain polyethylene glycol (PEG) to endow the particles with properties that prevent aggregation, enhance stability, and enable systemic administration.

We added 50-ng GAPDH siRNA or a scrambled negative-control siRNA with 100 ng of HER2 antibody conjugate. This complex was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then injected directly into xenograft tumors made using either SKBR3 or MCF7 cell lines. Seventy-two hours postinjection, the animals were sacrificed, and tumors were removed and analyzed using an in-house GAPDH ELISA assay. The relative gene reduction compared with scrambled negative controls was determined.

The PEGylated polyethyleneimine (PEI) was complexed with siRNA against VEGF-R2. Tail vein injection into tumorbearing mice showed selective uptake and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and growth rate. The complex was shown to improve serum stability over 12 h when compared with unformulated RNAi mediator. Using a similar approach, Kim et al. 74 utilized PEIgraft-PEG-folate to deliver siRNA targeting green fluorescent protein (GFP) to folate receptor overexpressing keratin-forming tumor cell line (KB) cells. Results demonstrated successful target reduction in the cytoplasm. Building on the premise of integrintargeted RNAi mediator delivery, Peer et al. 75 developed liposomal based \u03b27 integrin-targeted siRNA vehicles to target specific leukocyte subsets in gut inflammation. Using stabilized unilamellar vesicles (ULV), they covalently attached hyaluronan to palmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) in the ULV, which stabilized these particles during systemic circulation and endocytosis. A monoclonal antibody against \u03b27 integrins was covalently attached to the hyaluronan. This systemic application silenced CyD1 in leukocytes and reversed induced colitis in mice by suppressing leukocyte proliferation and T helper cell 1 cytokine expression. Covalent conjugations as performed by Peer et al. are typically performed through reactive sites carried on the head groups of phospholipids with the use of a crosslinker or other intermediary. These conjugations may be performed with homo-bifunctional or hetero-bifunctional crosslinking reagents, carbodiimides, reductive amination, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters, activation of carboxylates, or noncovalent use of an avidin-biotin interaction. Stability and in vivo use of these complexes often depend on the size of each liposomal particle, the amount of antibody in the reaction and the mole amount of lipid in the bilayer formulation. The use of liposomal-antibody conjugates was demonstrated by Pirollo et al. 58, 59 to specifically deliver siRNAs to both primary and metastatic tumors, including prostate, pancreatic, and breast tumors after systemic administration. Pirollo et al. utilized a TfRscFVliposomal complex to deliver an anti-HER-2 siRNA. The liposome encapsulated the siRNA by a cationic 1,2-dioleoyl-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) lipid and was labeled with the anti-TfRscFV targeting moiety. TfR levels have been shown to correlate with the proliferative nature of tumor cells and recycle during internalization in rapidly dividing cancer cells, 76, 77 contributing to the uptake of TfR-targeted liposomal complexes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 65, "end": 67, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 564, "end": 566, "text": "74", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 880, "end": 882, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 2195, "end": 2198, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2199, "end": 2201, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2790, "end": 2793, "text": "76,", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2794, "end": 2796, "text": "77", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Targeted Delivery Technology Using Peptides and Immuno-liposomal Conjugates"}, {"text": "Once siRNA has reached its intended target it must be released from the endosome to knockdown a gene of interest. This has often limited the efficacy of many studies. The incorporation of pH sensitive components into liposomes has been developed to try to enhance the efficiency of liposomal payload by exploiting the fact that endosomal compartments are generally acidic in nature. Destabilization of targeted liposomes following acidification has been enhanced by: (1) inclusion of (DOPE) which undergoes a lamellar to hexagonal phase transition at low pH, releasing captured liposomal components and (2) pH sensitive peptides that attach to the liposome at neutral pH and bind adjacent bilayers at acidic pH. Utilizing the latter approach, Chen et al. 78 and Aoki et al. 79 have developed histidine-lysine polymers that were shown to disrupt the endosomes and increase transfection efficiency over unmodified cationic liposomes. Using liposomes containing siRNA against HER2 with labeled polymers adapted from these studies, Pirollo et al. 59 demonstrated that tumor specific delivery resulted in near-complete knockdown of HER2 expression in tumors.

Data from preclinical programs suggest that siRNA therapeutics have the potential for treating disease. Many of the preclinical studies have led to ongoing clinical trials with encouraging preliminary results. Despite this progress, delivery remains the largest obstacle for improving siRNA therapy. Understanding how RNA-based therapies can be delivered into tissues affected by disease will be essential if they are to be widely successful in treating disease. Most current clinical trials utilize direct injection into organs or targeted administration of unmodified siRNA or siRNA with minor chemical modifications. While direct injection or targeted administrations remain the best option for siRNA delivery today, it is unlikely that siRNA-based therapeutics will be limited to these approaches. Broad yet targeted systemic clinical treatment will likely be the future for safe and efficacious human application.

ALN-VSP02 targets two key genes each involved in the disease pathway of liver cancer: kinesin spindle protein (KSP) and VEGF. It is thought that the dual-target approach increases the potential for a significant therapeutic benefit for cancer treatment. In preclinical studies, ALN-VSP demonstrated the ability to silence both tumor KSP and VEGF and stopped the proliferation of cancer cells. In these studies, ALN-VSP02 showed a striking reduction in the growth and number of significant tumor masses in the liver.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
