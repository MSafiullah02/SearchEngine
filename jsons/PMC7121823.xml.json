This patient is likely to have a pneumonia with secondary septic shock, but a central line-associated infection from her tunneled central line is possible, as are non-infectious complications of HSCT. Respiratory failure is the most frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission after HSCT, most frequently from an infectious cause. The patient was placed on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for oxygenation support and started on a norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support. Antibacterial coverage was changed to meropenem, levofloxacin, and vancomycin, and voriconazole was added for antifungal coverage. Her central line was removed. Her respiratory status continued to decline, and endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were required 24 h after admission. She was placed on volume assist-control with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. The BAL fluid was initially bloody, but cleared with sequential aliquots. Microbiologic studies of the BAL fluid were positive for respiratory syncytial virus and . She was maintained on low tidal-volume ventilation and vasopressors were weaned off. Her white blood cell count slowly began to recover, and her respiratory status began to improve. She was extubated on hospital day 12 and was discharged from the ICU on hospital day 14.",

No organism is identified in about 50% of neutropenic fevers [14, 15]. Bacteremia is documented in up to 25% of patients. Gram-positive bacteria are most commonly isolated [14, 16] (Table 80.1), while Gram-negative infections confer a higher mortality risk [17]. Fungal infections, particularly Candida and Aspergillus species, are frequent, especially in prolonged or profound neutropenia [15]. Approximately 10% of allogeneic HSCT patients will develop severe sepsis during the engraftment period [18], and mortality isapproximately 50% in those who go on to develop septic shock [11, 19, 20]. Mortality predictors include concomitant graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), respiratory failure, positive blood cultures, and multi-organ failure [18, 20].\n",

Empiric antibiotics must cover common organisms and should be tailored to patient-specific culture data and institutional epidemiology [14, 15]. Appropriate empiric antibiotics include an anti-pseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (e.g. piperacillin/tazobactam or cefepime, respectively), or a carbapenem [14, 15]. Vancomycin is not routinely indicated but should be added in the presence of a suspected catheter-related infection, soft tissue infection, oral mucositis, pneumonia, known colonization with resistant gram-positiveorganisms, or hemodynamic instability [14, 15, 21]. Aminoglycosidesshould not be added to an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam unless required by allergies, resistant organisms, or refractory hemodynamic instability [14, 21, 23\u201325].

More recent data suggest that more than 15% of patients undergoing allogeneic transplant develop ARDS with a mortality rate of 50\u201370% [33, 34]. Most cases of respiratory failure and ARDS after HSCT are related to infection, either a primary pulmonary infection or sepsis [35]. Common pulmonary infections and associated risk factors are shown in Table 80.2. Respiratory viral infection is common after HSCT [36, 37], and isassociated with significant mortality, especially with progression to lower respiratory tract infection [38\u201340]. In some cases, antiviral therapy with agents such as oseltamivir (influenza) or ribavirin (respiratory syncytial virus) is indicated [41]. Bacterial pneumonias are also common and may occur as a co-infection or secondary infection with a respiratory virus. Fungal and other opportunistic infections such as must also be considered [42]. As in immunocompetent patients, treatment ofARDS centers on treatment of the underlying cause while providing supportive care with low tidal volume mechanical ventilation. Neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning should be considered in patients with an arterial PO2: FiO2 \u2264 150 mmHg [43\u201345].\n",

It is nearly impossible to control delivered tidal volume with NIV and high delivered non-invasive tidal volumes are linked to higher rates of NIV failure [49].

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) occurs in up to 12% of patients and is associate with poor outcomes [56, 57]. Diagnosis ismost commonly made by observation of progressively bloody aliquots of bronchoalveolar lavage. Steroids are the mainstay of treatment of DAH, with some evidence that efficacy is greatest at doses <250 mg/day of methylprednisolone equivalent [57]. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a form of non-infectious lung injury after HSCT and is clinically defined by diffuse alveolar injury when infection, cardiac dysfunction, renal failure, and volume overload have been excluded [58]. IPS can have many manifestations, including ARDS, pulmonary capillary leak, DAH, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. IPS is thought to affect up to 15% of patients after myeloablative allogeneic HSCT, and only ~ 2% of patients after non-myeloablative HSCT. Median time of onset of IPS is 19 days after HSCT and mortality ranges from 60\u201380% in all patients, with nearly 100% mortality if mechanical ventilation is required [58]. Though thepathophysiology of IPS is incompletely understood, research indicating a pathogenic role for TNF-\u03b1 has led to the use of the anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody etanercept to treat IPS, with mixed clinical results [59\u201362]. The single randomized placebo-controlled trial in adults included only 34 patients and showed no benefit to etanercept when added to steroids (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day) [63].",

In addition to the usual ICU causes of AKI such as septic shock, there are many specific contributors to the risk of AKI in HSCT, including preparative chemotherapeutic regimens, nephrotoxins (e.g. tacrolimus, cyclosporine, antimicrobials), elevated cytokine levels, GVHD, and hepatic sinusoidal obstruction [65]. Hemorrhagic cystitis arising from chemotherapy toxicity or viral infection can cause significant blood loss and obstructive nephropathy due to blood clots. Management of AKI primarily consists of limiting exposure to nephrotoxins (if able) and maintaining adequate hemodynamics. If hemorrhagic cystitis ispresent, continuous bladder irrigation with a three-way catheter should be considered. The requirement for renal replacement therapy is ominous and portends a high mortality rate [65].",

Acute GVHD is a major contributor to peri-transplant morbidity and mortality, and is caused by donor-origin T-cells recognizing recipient tissues as foreign and instigating an immune response against the transplant recipient [69]. Acute GVHD generally occurs within the first 100 days after transplant and can affect the skin, mucosa, intestinal tract, and liver. Grading is based on severity of clinical manifestations, which include skin erythema or maculopapular rash; nausea, emesis, or diarrhea, and elevated bilirubin levels (Fig. 80.1, Table 80.3) [69\u201372]. Acute GVHD can progress to frank epidermal desquamation, massive diarrhea and hematochezia, and fulminant liver failure, respectively. Severe skin acute GVHD behaves much like a burn injury, and the expertise of a burn center may be required. Corticosteroids are the mainstayof treatment for acute GVHD, and the prognosis of steroid-refractory disease is poor [69, 73]. Prophylaxis against GVHD is an essential part of allogeneic transplant regimens and includes a variety of modalities, including calcinuerin inhibitors, anti-metabolites, and post-transplant cyclophosphamide [74]. As GVHD prophylaxis has improved, more patients are presenting with Grade II or Grade III acute GVHD (and fewer are presenting with Grade IV acute GVHD), the incidence of hepatic acute GVHD is decreasing, and overall mortality from acute GVHD is decreasing in patients treated withtacrolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis [73].\n\n",

BOS results from peribronchiolar fibrosis andobliteration of small airways resulting in the characteristic obstructive physiology [75]. Interstitial and subpleural fibrosis may also occur, resulting in concomitantrestrictive physiology. BOS occurs in approximately 3\u20135% of all patients after allogeneic HSCT, and 14% of those with chronic GVHD, but is likely underdiagnosed [76, 79, 80]. Inhaled corticosteroids appearefficacious in improving FEV1 in established BOS [81]. Systemic steroids are also commonly used to treat BOS and most patients are maintained on anti-GVHD immunosuppression with tacrolimus, sirolimus, or a calcineurin inhibitor [76]. Thecombination of inhaled fluticasone, azithromycin, and montelukast (FAM) appears to slow the decline in lung function with BOS [82] but has not yet been proven in a randomized controlled trial. While FAM is standard therapy for established BOS, recent data argue strongly against using azithromycin as prophylaxis against BOS due to decreased survival due to a higher rate of hematologic relapse [83]. Though FAM has been shown to decreasethe progression of BOS, mortality due to progressive lung disease remains high, and patients typically present to the ICU with respiratory failure. Unfortunately, with end-stage BOS, there are noeffective therapeutic options. A select few patients may be eligible for consideration for lung transplantation, but this is unusual, and in most cases goals of care should be addressed prior to aggressive ICU interventions.",

Even the phrase \u201cneutropenic sepsis\u201d is a misnomer, as the HSCT myelopreparative regimens also result in pancytopenia. Leukopenia, including neutropenia, lymphopenia, and monocytopenia, dramatically changes not only the acute response to infection, but the regulation of the adaptive immune response and the resolution and repair of injury [3, 7, 8, 84\u201390]. Platelets are increasingly recognized to play a vital role in the defense against bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and like leukocytes, are integral to the development and resolution of organ failure [91\u201395]. Not surprisingly, thrombocytopenia is associated with poor outcomes in critical illness [96]. Taken together, these data strongly supportthe notion that common critical care conditions, such as sepsis and respiratory failure, may differ dramatically in HSCT patients compared to \u201cnormal\u201d patients. Encouragingly, survival in neutropenic sepsis appears to be improving, but still lags that of non-neutropenic patients [12, 19, 48], and more research is needed.",

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia affects up to 35% of patients after HSCT and is associated with poor outcomes [99\u2013101]. Similarly, MDR gram negative infections, particularly carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), are associated with high mortality rates in allogeneic HSCT patients [102]. Successful treatment CRE infections ischallenging, and requires early use of multi-drug antibiotic regimens, typically including aminoglycosides, carbepenems, and polymyxins. However, none of the available regimens are particularly effective, and new antimicrobials are desperately needed.",

HSCT-TMA occurs in a large number of patients post allogeneic HSCT (up to 20\u201340%) and appears to be the result of endothelial injury and complement activation. Most occurrences are within the first 100 days after transplant. Patients can present to the ICU with acute kidney injury and neurologic changes in addition to hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia [65, 104]. Management is predominantly supportive, with blood pressure control, cessation of any possible pharmacologic instigators (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), and renal replacement therapy playing major roles. Recent case reports have suggested a possible role in some patients for the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab or theanti-complement antibody eculizumab, though neither of these agents has been definitively proven effective [104].",

Similarly, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are increasingly used for transplant instead of bone marrow stem cells [108]. However, the use of peripheral blood results in a larger number of donor T-cells included in the transplanted stem cells. This higher T-cell dose can result in a profound syndrome of fevers, vascular permeability, hemodynamic instability, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure. This constellation of findings is associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and has accordingly been labeled as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). While most associated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy [109], CRS is increasing recognized after PBSC transplant and is associated with poor outcomes [110]. Emerging data suggest that anti-IL-6 therapy with tocilizumab may improve outcomes, but more research is needed [110].",

As HSCT volumes increase and the complexity and potential toxicity of HSCT regimens expands, the number of critically ill HSCT patients will increase [48]. In response to this growing ICU volume, some centers continue to admit HSCT patients to general ICUs, but many high-volume transplant centers have developed specialty HSCT ICUs. While specialty HSCT ICUs have a number of potential benefits, there are few data to support (or dissuade) their development. Development of best practices for the provision of critical care to HSCT patients, including the optimum ICU organization is an important area for study [48]. Great progress in the critical care of HSCT patients has been made, but with continued basic and clinical research and further development of the sub-specialty of oncologic critical care, outcomes for critically ill HSCT patients should continue to improve.",
