It was composed of 1 pretriage unit, 3 special clinics, and 2 tents (Figure) . Personal protective equipment included an N95 mask covered by a surgical mask, a hair cap, a goggle, a facial shield, gloves, a gown, and shoe coverings.",

One guard was responsible for entry-gate control with an infrared thermal camera, and the other for patient traffic outside the ED. The officer checked immigration records from health insurance cards. If patients had any history of travel, high-risk occupation, cluster, or contact with patients with suspected COVID-19 and fever or respiratory symptoms, the nurse led pediatric patients to the special clinic 2 and adult patients to special clinic 3. If a patient with a positive history of travel, high-risk occupation, cluster, or contact with patients with suspected COVID-19 presented with respiratory distress, he or she was sent to a negative-pressure room, special clinic 1. Every patient was required to use hand hygiene and wear a surgical mask.",
