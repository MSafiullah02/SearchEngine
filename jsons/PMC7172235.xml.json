            "text": "The records of the Colorado State University Infectious Disease Laboratory between January 2001 and November 2004 were reviewed for feline submissions from United States veterinarians for which the primary presenting complaint included anemia and for which sufficient blood in EDTA or DNA from the blood digest were available for further testing. The majority of the samples had been submitted because the referring veterinarian suspected hemoplasmosis and requested assessment with a previously published hemoplasma PCR assay (Jensen et al 2001) offered as a clinical service at Colorado State University. The referring veterinarian was contacted for permission to review the medical record. Information gathered included results of complete blood count, serum biochemical panel, FeLV antigen test, FIV antibody test, age, state of origin, recent antibiotic history, recent vaccination history, clinical history and final diagnosis. Anemia was defined as a packed cell volume (PCV) or hematocrit (HCT) of <30%. Cases with a known cause of anemia were excluded from further study. In addition, cats known to have been administered vaccines within the previous 1 month or treated with antibiotics within 10 days of the presentation for evaluation of anemia based on the history listed on the submission forms were excluded. Anemia was classified as regenerative (absolute reticulocyte count >60,000 reticulocytes/\u03bcl or a corrected reticulocyte percent >1.5%) or non-regenerative (absolute reticulocyte count <60,000 reticulocytes/\u03bcl or a corrected reticulocyte percent <1.5%). Because very few of the records or submission forms stated the presence or absence of fleas, the state of origin of the case was used to classify each cat as high risk or low risk of exposure to Ctenocephalides felis (Jameson et al 1995). Samples were categorized as being from areas with low (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) or high flea prevalence (all other states). In a separate study of fever of unknown origin in cats, referring veterinarians from around the United States were requested to submit blood from a clinically healthy cat for use as a control sample for each case with fever (Lappin 2002). While the PCV of these cats was unknown, there were no history or physical examination findings consistent with anemia. DNA digests were selected from this group to serve as a control group solely based on sample availability.",

Because recent vaccination has been associated with immune-mediated hemolytic disease in some dogs (Duval and Giger 1996) and antibiotic therapy can result in falsely negative PCR assay results for some infectious agents, we intended to exclude these cases. While none of the anemic cats were excluded for these criteria, we cannot be certain that failure to find the information in the medical records provided proves that the treatments did not occur. For some cases, the duration of illness could not be determined which may have resulted in the classification of some cases into the non-regenerative anemia category when in fact the cases may have just been too acute to have developed a regenerative response. The blood samples were not assessed for all known infectious causes of anemia with the most sensitive techniques that are available. For example, while none of the veterinarians or complete blood count reports noted organisms consistent with C felis or Babesia species, it is possible some cats could have been cytology negative but PCR assay positive (Baneth et al., 2004, Birkenheuer et al., 2006a, Birkenheuer et al., 2006b).

            "text": "Regardless of these limitations, we believe the study results provide new information concerning anemia in cats. For example, infection by a hemoplasma species is thought to be one of the most common causes of anemia in cats and the majority of the samples assessed in this study were suspected to have hemoplasmosis by the referring veterinarian as evidenced by the submission for hemoplasma testing. However, hemoplasma DNA was amplified from only 20.2% of the cats with anemia and there was no significant difference in hemoplasma prevalence rates between healthy and anemic cats, regardless of flea risk. While both hemoplasmas are associated with anemia in some cats, not all infected cats develop anemia, most infected cats survive regardless of antibiotic treatment, and infection can persist for months in cats with or without antibiotic therapy (Tasker and Lappin 2002). These facts probably explain our failure to detect differences in prevalence rates between cats with anemia and healthy cats. However, the fact that a historical control group was used in this study versus an age-matched sample drawn from a healthy cat on the same day from the same clinic as anemic samples might also account for the lack of a difference. In addition, these results also document that amplification of hemoplasma DNA from the blood of a cat does not directly prove the anemia was a result of the infection. Failure to document hemoplasma infection in 79.8% of suspect cases supports our hypothesis that other causes of anemia in cats exist and may be common. In future studies, PCR assays that amplify C felis, Babesia species, and \u2018Candidatus M turicensis\u2019 should also be used.",

However, results of this study fail to link Bartonella species to presence of anemia, regardless of flea risk. In a separate study of sick cats in North Carolina, cats with B henselae antibodies in their serum were no more likely to be anemic than cats that were B henselae seronegative (Breitschwerdt et al 2005). We believe that the results of these two studies suggest B henselae and B clarridgeiae are not common causes of anemia in cats. There are several potential limitations to prevalence studies based on PCR assay results. While the primers utilized in this study occasionally amplify non-Bartonella species DNA, all amplicons detected in this study were of the appropriate size and so we do not believe false positive results occurred (Maggi and Breitschwerdt 2005a). As mentioned, if antibiotics had been previously administered and not recorded in the medical record, some cases may have had falsely negative results. In addition, while PCR assays are very sensitive, blood culture is still considered the most sensitive and specific test to prove Bartonella species bacteremia (Guptill, 2005, Maggi et al., 2005b). Future prospective studies should include blood culture, serology, and PCR assay results.",

            "text": "Primary immune-mediated disease is thought to be the most common cause of hemolytic anemia in dogs (Dodds, 1977, Klay et al., 1993, Day, 1999). Primary immune-mediated anemia can also be non-regenerative if the immune reaction is directed toward bone marrow precursors (Stokol and Blue, 1999, Weiss, 2002). In cats, anemia has frequently been attributed to infectious and other diseases with primary immune-mediated disease thought to be less common (Werner and Gorman 1984). However, in the anemic cats described here, approximately 75% of cats with regenerative or non-regenerative anemia had no identifiable infectious cause and 60% of cats with regenerative anemia had no obvious sign of blood loss or identifiable infectious cause; however, we did not test for some known infectious causes of anemia in cats including C felis, Babesia species, and \u2018Candidatus M turicensis\u2019. The data presented and recent work from Germany (Kohn et al 2006) suggest that cats are more predisposed to primary immune-mediated anemia than previously thought or may have another unidentified infectious cause of hemolytic anemia. The possibility that primary hemolytic anemia may be more common in cats than previously recognized warrants further prospective study.",
