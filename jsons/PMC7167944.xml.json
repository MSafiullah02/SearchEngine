The methods have been described in detail earlier (14, 17). Pre\u2010defined exclusion criteria were systemic corticosteroid treatment in the preceding 4 wk, chronic disease (other than asthma or allergy), severe wheezing necessitating intensive care unit treatment or previous participation in this study. For this analysis, we also excluded children with less than two previous wheezing attacks, as we wanted to focus on recurrent wheezing. In addition, a few children aged \u22657 yr were excluded to narrow down the age distribution. As in our previous report, we wanted to focus only on virus\u2010positive children. Atopy was defined as positive immunoglobulin E antibodies against common allergens (18). All asthma diagnoses fulfilled the criteria suggested by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, USA (19). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Turku University Hospital, and written informed consents were obtained from the parents before commencing the study.",

Blood samples for eosinophil analyses were collected on entry, and as described above, and analyzed according to the standard clinical routine in the Central Laboratory, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. Exhaled NO was successfully collected with the tidal breathing offline collection procedure from 46 children (36 children with picornavirus and 10 with other virus infection on entry) according to the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society before randomization at the ward and analyzed in the Department of Clinical Physiology, Turku University Hospital (Sievers 280, Nitric Oxide Analyzer; Sievers Instruments Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) (14). Triple measurements of respiratory resistance (Rrs) at 5, 20, and 35 Hz were performed according to normal clinical protocol of our hospital (Master Screen IOS, Erich Jaeger GmbH, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany) (20). Measurements were repeated after inhalation of 300 \u03bcg salbutamol.",

The normality of data distribution was tested using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. The t\u2010test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used for continuous variables. Categorical data were analyzed using the chi\u2010square test or Fischer's exact test. The efficacy of prednisolone was analyzed using multivariate regression analysis (generalized linear model) with backward stepwise elimination model using negative binominal distribution and log\u2010link. The model included the study drug, age, atopic disease, blood eosinophil count at entry, duration of preceding respiratory symptoms, viral etiology (picornaviruses and RSV), and antibiotic treatment, i.e., the variables in which baseline difference was found between prednisolone and placebo groups or between picornavirus and non\u2010picornavirus groups. Interpretation of generalized linear model is carried out using the concept of risk ratio (RR), which means how much risk changes when an independent variable (if continuous) changes by one unit. In categorical explanatory variables, RR tells how great risk is in one group when compared with another group. Interaction between study drug and picornavirus, rhinovirus, or enterovirus positivity, blood eosinophil count on entry, presence of atopy, age, and severity of symptoms were also tested, i.e., one interaction in each model. E.g., the drug*picornavirus interaction term in the model refers to estimated differences in the drug effect in the picornavirus and non\u2010picornavirus groups. Furthermore, to estimate the drug effect in certain patient groups, e.g., in picornavirus and non\u2010picornavirus groups, contrast estimates were formulated to test the effect of the drug in each group. The effects of prednisolone on oxygen saturation and exhaled nitric oxide during the first 48 h of hospital stay were tested at 12 h intervals using the repeated measurements analysis of variance. Statistical significance was established at a p value lower than 0.05. The statistical analyses were carried out using SAS/STAT(r) software, Version 9.1.3 SP3 of the SAS System for Windows, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.",

Although there are no other virus\u2010specific efficacy studies available in children suffering from recurrent wheezing or asthma, the efficacy of prednisolone in rhino\u2010 and enterovirus\u2010induced wheezing was what was to be expected on the basis of the high detection rate of respiratory picornaviruses in acute childhood asthma and separate studies showing the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in this patient group (1, 3, 10). However, we were surprised by the finding that prednisolone also decreased the duration of hospitalization in picornavirus affected children because previous studies on pediatric asthma have had difficulties demonstrating it. A recent meta\u2010analysis of these studies have shown efficacy in the discharge rate at the first re\u2010examination in the outpatient ward, in the improvement of clinical severity scores, and in the number of relapses over 1\u20133 months after discharge, but not in the duration of hospitalization (10). The rapid resolution of wheezing (median of 18 h in our children) makes it difficult to demonstrate a decrease in hospitalization time. The negative clinical outcomes in all patients may be, thus, because of the different viral etiologies of illness, or in broader scope, because of the association of certain host characteristics with picornavirus infections.",

(11) studied 123 wheezing children aged 1.5\u201318 months and found shorter duration of hospitalization in prednisolone than placebo group. Only 31% of children were RSV\u2010positive. Goebel et al. (12) studied 51 first\u2010time wheezers aged less than 2 yr and showed lower symptom scores in prednisolone group than in placebo group. Only 35% of children were RSV\u2010positive. Schuh et al. (13) showed marked effects with a single dose of dexamethasone in 70 first\u2010time wheezers aged 8 wk to 23 months in an emergency room setting. Half the number of children were RSV\u2010positive. More recently, a Finnish study showed shorter hospital stays and a shorter duration of symptoms in 230 wheezing children aged 6\u201335 months treated with prednisolone (21). Although no viral diagnostics were used in that study, many of the children were older than those typically infected by RSV. As RSV\u2010positive children have clearly not benefited from corticosteroids (4, 5, 6, 7) and rhinovirus has been detected in 20\u201340% and enteroviruses in 10\u201320% of the cases bronchiolitis cases (1, 2, 15, 22), these earlier studies support the view that systemic corticosteroids may be effective in respiratory picornavirus\u2010affected children. Finally, we have demonstrated in our earlier report that standard dose of prednisolone reduced relapses during a 2\u2010month period after first or second episode of wheezing associated with rhinovirus infection and/or blood eosinophils \u22650.2 \u00d7 109/l, but not with RSV infection, in 78 children aged 3\u201335 months (14).

In these studies, systemic, inhaled, or nasal corticosteroids administered to non\u2010atopic adults and atopic adults with mild asthma have not clearly reduced symptoms or airway responsiveness (23, 24, 25). We argue that the experimental infections in adults with mild asthma are not comparable to natural viral infection in children, especially to moderate\u2010to\u2010severe cases necessitating hospitalization. Children susceptible to rhinovirus\u2010induced moderate\u2010to\u2010severe wheezing may not just present a case of any viral illness. Instead, these cases may reveal children with underlying immunologic anomaly predisposing them to more severe outcome of rhinovirus infections (26, 27). We speculate that markedly elevated baseline eosinophil counts and higher prevalence of atopy found in rhinovirus\u2010affected children when compared with children affected by other viruses may also increase susceptibility for more severe diseases (14, 28). However, there was no significant interaction between the study drug and blood eosinophil count on entry, atopy, or age in the current study.",

In asthmatic children, the eosinopenic effect has been reported to last at least 5 days after the discontinuation of a 5\u2010day treatment with prednisolone (29). In asthmatic adults, blood eosinophils have returned to baseline level 1 wk after a 12\u2010day treatment with prednisolone (30). In our study, no difference in eosinophil levels was found 2 wk after the prednisolone treatment. It appears that the eosinopenic effect of 3\u2010day course of prednisolone is lost within 2 wk. This is in agreement with our previous report on early wheezing (14).",

As a result of difficulties designing picornavirus\u2010specific studies in children, our analyses were carried out post hoc. The power calculation was based on RSV\u2010infection, because previous data on rhinovirus\u2010specific efficacy were not available. The final sample size was quite small, and it could account for some negative findings, e.g., the efficacy associated with atopy and increased blood eosinophils. Despite intensive search, the detection of other than respiratory picornavirus infections was low. It is the most likely reason for the prolonged time until ready for discharge in non\u2010picornavirus\u2010affected children receiving prednisolone when compared with placebo. The reliability of a positive PCR test in the detection of an active viral infection may be questioned (1). We have previously shown in our wheezing patients that cases of positive picornavirus PCR markedly decreased within 2\u20133 wk and disappeared within 5\u20136 wk after acute wheezing, suggesting that PCR positivity is related to acute infection (31). In the current study, viral load was not assessed. Balanced randomization was lost because of exclusion of many subjects before analysis. It should be noted that virus\u2010specific results come from various subgroup analyses and are only secondary outcomes. Finally, we studied only hospitalized children receiving abundant bronchodilating medication and excluded children requiring intensive care. The strengths of this study include careful recording of risk factors, detailed viral diagnostics, and prospective follow\u2010up.",
