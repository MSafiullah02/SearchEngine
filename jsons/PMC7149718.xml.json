Community pharmacists must strategically position themselves in the community to serve the public health. Community pharmacies can be found on main streets, in malls and supermarkets, at the heart of the most rural villages, and in the center of the most deprived communities. In some countries, many community pharmacies are opened early and closed late when other healthcare professionals are unavailable (CPNI, no date). According to WHO (1994), among healthcare providers, community pharmacists are the most accessible to the public. In practice, a pharmacy provides medications and other healthcare products and services and helps people and society make the best use of them (Wiedenmayer et al., 2006). Community pharmacists supply, dispense, and sell medications according to the law. A proper dispensing practice will interpret and evaluate a prescription; select and manipulate or compound a pharmaceutical product; and label and supply the product in an appropriate container according to legal and regulatory requirements (WHO, 1994). In addition, pharmacy activities include a pharmacist\u2019s provision of information and instructions to patients, and, under a pharmacist\u2019s supervision, practices will ensure the patient\u2019s safe and effective use of the medicines.",

Many studies, initiatives, and interventions, especially in developed countries, have been conducted to improve patient care and health outcomes. In an attempt to provide health and pharmaceutical care to patients and society, the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors in developing countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), are facing challenges. These challenges include the shortage of human resources in the pharmacy workforce; inefficient health systems; the rising costs of medicines and healthcare; limited financial resources; the huge burden of disease; and changing social, epidemiological, technological, economic, and political situations (Mohamed Ibrahim, Palaian, Al-Sulaiti, & El-Shami, 2016).",

            "text": "Studies have reported that community pharmacists in developing countries, especially LMICs, do not provide quality services. A quick look at 19 developing countries (Fathelrahman, Mohamed Ibrahim, & Wertheimer, 2016) shows that the community pharmacy practice setting is regarded as popular. Unfortunately, this practice setting also presents some concerns. For example, some countries allow nonpharmacists to operate pharmacies and to handle medicines. In some countries, the practice of community pharmacy is not well regulated, with little to no minimum standard of practice (Hussain, Mohamed Ibrahim, & Zaheer, 2012d). Many pharmacy personnel who dispense medicines are unqualified, with no college/university diploma or professional degree in pharmacy (Lenjisa, Mosisa, Woldu, & Negassa, 2015). A study in Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (Gokcekus, Toklu, Demirdamar, & Gumusel, 2012) reported that the pharmacy employees have no pharmacy-based training and that pharmacists believed that their employees are capable to handle the prescriptions. Studies in Qatar, Pakistan, Malaysian, and Sudan have indicated that dispensing and labeling practices and provider\u2013patient interactions are poor (Alamin Hassan et al., 2014, Hussain and Mohamed Izham, 2011, Hussain et al., 2012d, Mohamed Ibrahim et al., 2014, Mohamed Ibrahim et al., 2016, Osman et al., 2012). In addition, a few dispensing errors have been identified (Lenjisa et al., 2015). According to Basak, Arunkumar, and Masilamani (2009), community pharmacy services in India are quite problematic, and the pharmacy\u2019s role in healthcare remains unrecognized. These authors have called for reform to meet societal needs. A study in Nigeria found that some community pharmacists often administer injections for customers\u2014in some cases, without a prescription. The number of prescriptions that community pharmacists receive is low. They suffer from the limited availability of some resources, which has a serious impact on their practice (Adje & Oli, 2013). A review of community pharmacy practices showed that, in some countries, pharmacy outlets were run by nonpharmacists; dispensing practices were unsatisfactory; drug sellers\u2019 level of knowledge regarding diseases and medicines was poor; medicines were used irrationally; pharmacies were not meeting the government\u2019s licensing requirements; medication storage conditions were improper; and customers could hardly meet with pharmacists (Hussain et al., 2012a, Hussain et al., 2012b, Hussain et al., 2012d, Hussain and Ibrahim, 2012). A study on over-the-counter (OTC) counseling in Brazil (Halila, Junior, Otuki, & Correr, 2015) concluded that even though the most important factors taken into account when counseling an OTC medicine were drug\u2019s efficacy and adverse effects, but only few pharmacists knew the meaning of terms related to evidence-based health. Poudel, Subish, Mishra, Mohamed Ibrahim, and Jayasekera (2010) reported that unregistered fixed-dose combinations of pharmaceutical products (e.g., antimicrobial combinations, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug combinations, and antimotility combinations) have been found in Nepali healthcare facilities, including drug outlets. Regarding prescription behavior, even in rural areas of India, the proportion of brand name prescriptions was high (Aravamuthan, Arputhavanan, Subramaniam, & Chander, 2017).",

Even worse, some community pharmacists lack particular competencies and communication skills, have no or few business skills, and do not have up-to-date knowledge. In some cases, pharmacists do not comply with regulations (e.g., selling antibiotics or psychotropic drugs without a prescription), and they often fail to assume responsibility for pharmaceutical care. In the eyes of the consumers, community pharmacists are always regarded as businesspeople rather than as healthcare professionals. Community pharmacists must strike a balance between professional and business responsibilities.

Pharmacists should be both health generalists and health specialists, which will have an impact on public health. Even the American Public Health Association (1981) supports the pharmacists\u2019 role in public health. Should community pharmacists move beyond their traditional role? Even when dispensing medicines through paper-based prescription services, pharmacists should comply with some fundamental standards. Safety issues must be considered when dispensing medications. The Pharmacy Board of Australia published guidelines for medication dispensing (i.e., guidelines for scanned and faxed prescriptions and steps to take when handling Internet or mail-order dispensing); guidelines for dispensing extemporaneous medications; guidelines when handling errors (e.g., dispensing errors); guidelines for appropriate medication labeling; guidelines for patient counseling, privacy, and confidentiality; and pharmacy technicians\u2019 functions, responsibilities, and competencies (Pharmacy Board of Australia, n.d.). In addition, for pharmacies that use electronic and computer systems, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (n.d.) has provided several guidelines and principles for good dispensing and appropriate dispensing procedures (e.g., professional checking, medication substitution, and labeling). Malaysia, a developing country, has also developed Guide to Good Dispensing Practice (Malaysian Pharmaceutical Services Division, 2016). These guidelines aim to have both public and private facilities dispensing medications according to the law and guidelines, which may ensure that patients receive the correct medications, adherence is improved, adverse effects are minimized, and errors are avoided. The document\u2019s contents relate to processing prescriptions, preparing medications, labeling, recoding, and issuing medications to the patient. In geographical areas where no pharmacists are available, a guide about managing medicines would be a handy document indeed (Andersson & Snell, 2010).",

Outcomes refer to the consequences (results) of interventions that are made to achieve therapeutic goals. Outcomes can have economic, social/behavioral, or physiological characteristics. When community pharmacists are serving the public, in addition to health outcomes, at least four important parameters should be monitored: accessibility, availability, affordability, and acceptability.

            "text": "To progress and gain society\u2019s acceptance, community pharmacists must acknowledge the following challenges in healthcare systems:1.One-third of the world\u2019s population is known to lack regular access to essential medicines. For many people, the cost of medication is a major constraint. Those hardest hit are patients in developing and transitional economies, where 50% to 90% of medicines are out-of-pocket expenses (WHO, 1998). The burden falls most heavily on the poor, who are not adequately protected by current policies or by health insurance.2.Healthcare workers, including community pharmacist, are in short supply, especially in LMICs (WHO, 2016).3.Some countries are eager to introduce and establish a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree in pharmacy colleges, but due to several reasons, they have failed to produce competent graduates who can apply clinical knowledge in practice or who can distance the practice from its traditional role.4.The logistical aspects of distribution, often seen as the pharmacist\u2019s traditional role (i.e., the \u201ccount and pour, lick and stick pharmacy\u201d), represent another challenge.5.In terms of medication quality, studied medication samples have failed quality control tests (MSH, 2012), and substandard and counterfeit medications are highly likely to be on pharmacy shelves.6.Another major challenge is ensuring that medicines are used as advised or instructed; more than half of all prescriptions are incorrect, and more than half of the people who are prescribed with medications fail to take them correctly. Medication adherence can be affected if the medication is unavailable or unaffordable or if the instructions given are not understood or remembered. Furthermore, a patient\u2019s confidence or trust in the pharmacist or the medications prescribed may also affect adherence.\n7.Especially in economically deprived communities, self-medication with either modern or traditional medicines is becoming common practice. Individuals resort to self-medication when healthcare services become more unaffordable and inaccessible (Hughes, McElnay, & Fleming, 2001). The situation deteriorates when prescription medicines can be easily obtained over the counter. Community pharmacists could play a role in mitigating the risks of self-medication (Bennadi, 2013).\n",

These machines could provide customers access to OTC drugs, nondrug items, and information, thereby supporting the self-care concept (Steinfirst, Cowell, Presley, & Reifler, 1985). This technology could be argued to have an adverse effect on customers. For example, the buying and selling process lacks the \u201chuman touch,\u201d or customers leave the pharmacy without information or take medication incorrectly due to a lack of quality information. However, what is the difference when the same customers visit pharmacies with \u201cinvisible pharmacists\u201d? Do pharmacists just count pills?

            "text": "To be effective healthcare team members, community pharmacists need skills and abilities that will enable them to assume many different functions. WHO introduced the concept of the \u201cseven/eight-star pharmacist,\u201d which the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) adopted in 2000 in its policy statement on Good Pharmacy Education Practice to outline the caregiver, decision-maker, communicator, manager, lifelong learner, teacher, and leader roles of the pharmacist. The pharmacist\u2019s function as a researcher has since evolved, and all these roles have been addressed in the competence standards (WHO, 1997, pp. 27\u201329). Community pharmacists have to make efforts to move from being drug compounders and dispensers to being pharmaceutical care providers and medication experts; their role and function should focus on patient-centered care rather than products and profits. Community pharmacists must equip themselves with adequate knowledge and skills and be responsible for ensuring that, irrespective of the medications provided and used, quality products are selected, procured, stored, distributed, dispensed, and administered to enhance patients\u2019 health and do them no harm. Relevant pharmacy authorities should provide more support, training, and development for community pharmacies to help their pharmacists deliver high-quality services. Pharmacy associations could organize programs in collaboration with pharmacy colleges and could involve regional or international experts if affordable. Nonprofit international organizations, such as WHO and Management Sciences for Health (MSH), could assist LMICs in this matter. In addition, some chain pharmacies could implement monthly programs. Community pharmacists must be involved in CPD; individual pharmacists are responsible for the systematic maintenance, development, and broadening of their knowledge, skills, and attitudes to ensure their continued competence as professionals throughout their careers. Community pharmacists (with the help of academics from pharmacy colleges, if required) must conduct research to document outcomes and impacts (e.g., accessibility, effectiveness, and positive perceptions of the experience); research must be conducted to assess the minimum standards and quality of community pharmacies and to provide evidence-based practice information. The numbers of published studies from developing countries are very low compared with those from developed countries. Managerial and educational interventions are needed to improve the practice. Community pharmacists could obtain inputs/ideas and explore the perceptions of community pharmacy staff\u2014in addition to customers and patients\u2014regarding aspects of service quality. These inputs could then perhaps be used to improve the services offered to customers. Some pharmacists are able to use information technology to enhance pharmacy and pharmaceutical services; pharmacists in some other countries find doing it so problematic\u2014due to a very basic infrastructure or the lack of basic competencies, among others. Finally, WHO (Wiedenmayer et al., 2006) and other sources have provided a guide and systematic approach for delivering pharmacy patient-centered care and good pharmacy and dispensing practice.",

The customer\u2019s (patient\u2019s) expectations are rapidly changing; customers are becoming more aware of their healthcare needs. Customers now demand better quality care and more attention to maintain or improve their overall health. Evidence has shown that challenges and gaps exist in community pharmacy practice.

Thus, pharmacy authorities, policy makers, and educators must collaborate to fix these problems and make improvements.\u2022Due to the high prevalence of chronic diseases and the need to improve public health and well-being, community pharmacists must continue to be competent in their professional and business roles; pharmacists should expand the role in delivering wellness services (e.g., disease-oriented pharmaceutical care) that go beyond filling prescriptions.\u2022Many developing nations do not have effective and efficient regulations, guidelines, policies, governmental support, or electronic patient records and databases in community pharmacies to help establish and implement clinical, cognitive, and extended pharmacy services.\u2022Community pharmacists should establish benchmark best practices\u2014at the very least among countries with similar economies and levels of development.\n",
