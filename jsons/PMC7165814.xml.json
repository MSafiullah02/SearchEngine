After only 2 months, the epidemic of COVID\u201019 is already larger than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) outbreak, which during 2002/2003 lasted 8 months and infected 8096 people, with a mortality rate of 9\u00b75%. It is a larger threat than the multiple smaller outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), a zoonotic coronavirus that was discovered in 2012 (Bermingham et al. \n2012).",

There is evidence that SARS\u2010CoV originated in bats in China and reached humans most probably after jumping to an intermediate host, the civet (Paguma larvata) (reviewed by Wang and Eaton 2007). Similarly, MERS\u2010CoV is endemic in dromedary camels in the Middle East, from which it can be transmitted to humans, but it may also have originated in bats (Cui et al. \n2019). The MERS epidemic is ongoing, and as of December 2019, 2468 cases have been reported (Baharoon and Memish 2019) and the mortality rate has been as high as 42% (Mohd et al. \n2016). At the other end of the virulence spectrum are coronavirus species that cause common colds in humans with relatively mild symptoms (reviewed by Su et al. \n2016).",

While this manuscript was under review, it was published that this animal might have been a pangolin (Manis javanica; Liu et al. \n2019). Alternatively, though less likely, a highly infectious patient zero may have been present at the market, as we now know that the virus can spread via human\u2010to\u2010human contacts (Riou and Althaus 2020) and individuals infected with a coronavirus can be \u2018super\u2010spreaders\u2019, as was demonstrated for MERS (Cho et al. \n2016; Kang et al. \n2017).",

SARS, MERS and 2019_nCoV are members of Betacoronavirus, which is divided into the subgenera Embecovirus, Hibecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Sarbecovirus. All coronaviruses have a genome consisting of a positive\u2010sense single\u2010strand RNA molecule. A long polycystronic messenger is produced from this that codes for a number of proteins, some of which are posttranslationally cleaved to produce smaller proteins (Cui et al. \n2019). Approximately two\u2010thirds of the genome codes for a large open reading frame, often called \u2018orf 1ab\u2019 that undergoes a frame shift during translation, and whose product is processed into a number of smaller proteins, while a variable number of smaller open reading frames are located downstream of orf 1ab.",

(2020) recently published a phylogenetic tree based on 50 genome sequences (including 10 2019_nCoV isolates) with high bootstrap values, which can only be obtained with sufficient degrees of conservation between members of the data set. Their analysis was based on complete genomes (presumably, nucleotide sequences), whereas in our pilot analysis only protein\u2010coding nucleotide sequences were compared. This initiated an analysis to identify how much of the phylogenetic signal and conservation was actually present in noncoding regions of the viral genomes. In case of coronavirus these are mostly restricted to the 5\u2019\u2010 and 3\u2010\u2018end flanks, as all open reading frames are tightly packed. Therefore, a more extensive comparison was performed, this time with either the 5\u2019\u2010 or the 3\u2019\u2010end noncoding flanks, obtained from 31 whole genome sequences covering all subspecies of Betacoronavirus (Table 1). This selection included the most variable genomes identified by Lu and colleagues, complemented with other members of the subgenera, while genomes with high similarity to another genome were discarded to remove redundancy. The phylogenetic trees obtained with these two noncoding regions are shown in Fig. 1. Both fragments could separate the four subspecies, and an unclassified bat isolate from Cameroon could be identified as a member of the Nobecovirus. Another unclassified virus isolated from a Nigerian bat showed high similarity with the only other fully sequenced member of Hibecovirus, at least for its 5\u2019\u2010 flank (Fig. 1a).",

            "text": "Although any section of the viral genome that is conserved within but not between subspecies would result in correct classification, the conservation of such regions within coding sequences of Sarbecovirus members was generally weaker than we observed for the noncoding flanks. Using coding sequences of this same small selection of seven Sarbecovirus members, the maximum conservation at nucleotide level for gene 1a/b was 85% within a sliding window of 60 bases, compared to 93% for the downstream and 90% for the upstream flank. The longest stretch of conserved nucleotides was 22 in the upstream flank, 33 in the downstream flank and only 20 nucleotides in orf 1ab (results not shown). Only the gene coding for envelope protein E was as strongly conserved as the noncoding flanks (maximum conservation 95% over a window of 60 bases, with a longest conserved stretch of 32 nucleotides) for the seven genomes analysed here. As conservation of coding sequences decreases with third\u2010base variation, it is likely that this degree of conservation in gene E would decrease as more genomes would be included in the comparison. Thus, restricting analyses to only comparing coding regions may reduce the chance a proposed detection target might be able to detect a novel Sarbecovirus species. Instead, we recommend inclusion of the noncoding genome regions in such attempts. Although it was not our aim to develop improved detection methods (for which we would have to experimentally test any proposed target region), our findings can be a starting point for such studies.",

The food market of Wuhan may or may not have been selling bats for food; however, bats and their excrements are often used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which may be a reason for their legal or illegal trading. It is also possible that the virus had infected another mammal that was traded at the market and served as the source of the infection. Such a case has been proposed for Malayan pangolins (Liu et al. \n2019), a meat delicacy that was most likely sold in the exotic meat market. Such cross\u2010infection could also have occurred during handling, storage or selling prior to animals reaching the food market. The case for pangolins being the actual source of 2019_nCoV has not yet been proven, but was referred from sequence similarities (Liu et al. \n2019).

Of these bat species, the first three can be found in the province of Hubei (source: http://www.iucnredlist.org); the habitat of S. ornatus reaches to the south of the province but does not cover the Wuhan area, while S. kuhlii is not endemic in this region. A number of whole genome Sarbecovirus sequences isolated from these bats and other bat species were selected and their 5\u2019\u2010flank was compared to that of 2019_nCoV (Fig. 2). This produced the highest identity to the same isolate that Lu and coworkers had identified (Lu et al. \n2020), demonstrating that an analysis of 253 nucleotides directly upstream of the start codon of the polycystronic messenger suffices to identify genetic relationships between Sarbecovirus species.",

However, the database is highly biased towards particular bat species that were specifically sampled in search of the source of SARS. Highly similar coronaviruses can be detected in different bat species (as identified by asterisks in Fig. 2), so that even a high similarity match to a bat isolate may not always identify the correct bat species that was the cause of a given zoonotic outbreak. This caution can be extended to other possible animal hosts that have been or will be claimed as sources of the 2019_nCoV without a proven epidemiological link.",

Both practices could be highly risky in case an animal was infected with a coronavirus, particularly the first use, as the virus can be present in faeces and can enter a host via the eye. We speculate that a live or recently deceased infected bat species was handled by traders because of its value in TCM, and that such an infected individual, or the still infective bat or bat products, may have been the route by which the virus entered the exotic meat market in Wuhan. Alternatively, during the trade chain, a host jump occurred between an infected bat (handled for TCM purposes) and another mammal, that then was the source of infection. Less likely, because the material is usually dried significantly, the outbreak may have started by medicinal use of bat\u2010derived, contaminated TCM material. In this respect it is interesting to note that the first known onset of symptoms (on 1 December 2019) were observed in a patient with no known epidemiological links to the Wuhan food market (Huang et al. \n2020).",
