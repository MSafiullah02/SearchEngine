Approximately 2.4 million cases have been reported up to date, including approximately 83.000 confirmed cases in Turkey [2]. The prominent symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and fatigue, as well as hemoptysis, and dyspnea. In severe cases, patients develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac problems, and multiple organ failure [4]. Besides, they also have neuro-invasive abilities and might spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system [3], [4]. It was recently shown that some patients with COVID-19 have neurological symptoms, such as headache, anosmia, dysgesia, dizziness, and impaired consciousness [4], [5]. COVID-19 may also predispose cerebrovascular diseases due to excessive inflammation, immobilization, hypoxia, and diffuse intravascular coagulation [6]. In this case report, 4 patients with COVID-19 were reported to be simultaneously accompanied by neurological involvement of acute ischemic stroke independently of the critical disease process. Although the pathophysiology of the neurological signs caused by COVID-19 have not been investigated in a detailed manner, the spectrum and intensities of these manifestations need to be explored.",

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities and accompanying consolidated areas which were compatible with Covid-19 pneumonia in all cases. The Covid-19 PCR tests of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for all 4 cases. They were treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. All patients had increased blood pressure (\u2265130/80 mmHg) at admission of stroke. Intravenous alteplase or mechanical thrombectomy treatments were not indicated. Therefore, they were managed with antithrombotic therapy, blood pressure control, intravenous fluids and supportive care.",

She was thought to be infected upon contact with her sick son. Brain dMRI showed left lenticulostriate artery infarction. Case 3 is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension. He was admitted with loss of consciousness, dysarthria, and right hemiparesis. The NIHSS score was 10. Although he had only mild cough, he had a viral transmission history 1 week before. The cortical branches of left MCA was affected in dMRI. Case 4 is a 77-year-old male admitting to emergency room with fever, cough and shortness of breath over the last two days. He had also left hemi-hypoesthesia and mild ataxia. The NIHSS score was 2. Brain dMRI showed right pontine infarction.

In the study of Li et al, the median durations from first symptoms of Covid-19 to cerebrovascular disease were 10 days [7]. The average of time from Covid-19 symptom onset to the diagnosis of stroke was 2 days in our cases. Of the patients with stroke, 2 were large vessel stenosis, 2 was small vessel occlusion. There was no cardioembolic type. Another interesting aspect of our study was that, unlike previous studies, none of the patients developed a severe Covid-19 infection [4], [7].",

Some blood inflammatory factors like CRP are thought to be responsible for early molecular events triggered by coagulation abnormalities [8]. In our study, 3 of the patients had elevated D-dimer levels, as well as two of them had high CRP levels. However, the clinical and radiological severity of Covid-19 infection in these patients were similar. There is a doubt regarding the increased inflammatory response underlying the abnormal blood coagulation in early stage of cerebrovascular diseases. It could also be speculated that Covid-19 patients were more prone to stroke, and the most accompanying comorbidity was hypertension. Our cases with anterior system infarction had higher D-dimer levels. Although our number of cases was limited, the severity of stroke offers an insight that it may vary depending on D-dimer levels.",
