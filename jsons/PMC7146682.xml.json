Shortly after writing this Correspondence, the Olympic Games were officially postponed to 2021.",

These considerations are crucial even for mass gatherings of which most attendees are young adults (eg, sports, music). At mass gatherings of mainly older and more vulnerable people with comorbidities (mainly religious), these considerations are even more relevant. Furthermore, the density of the typical mass gathering renders social distancing and continued disinfection of hard surfaces impossible. Outbreaks emanating from mass gatherings can also serve as potent seeds for successive waves of infection through international and regional travel. Finally, even with carefully thought-out mass gatherings, unless the viral evolutionary trajectory of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is determined, premature promotion of mass gatherings can only lead to re-ignition of the pandemic. Although the initial human response can be described as panic at times of crises, complacency quickly sets in.5, 6 As public health leaders, we cannot be seen to permit even any tacit endorsement of a mass gathering during this unprecedented global event. When governments and societal and economic systems are unanimously intensifying efforts toward the economically and personally challenging concept of social distancing, any call to consider mass gatherings sends a diametrically opposing and confusing message to the public.",
