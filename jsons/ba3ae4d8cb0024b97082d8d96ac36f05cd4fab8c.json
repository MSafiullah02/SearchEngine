Culture for many organisms is notoriously insensitive due to fastidious growth requirements, and DFAs and ELISA are labor-intensive and insensitive due to low-level infections that fall below the practical sensitivity of these methodologies. DFAs are also subject to technical error and subjective/inconsistent result interpretation.

Because the LDT LoD for RSV exceeded the value originally established for that assay by greater than 1 log, sequencing of the target region of the test virus was performed to check for polymorphisms potentially affecting PCR efficiency (12) . Sequencing revealed two previously undescribed polymorphisms that likely account for this difference. These results are consistent with LDT and FARP having comparably low LoDs for RSV strains not containing these polymorphisms.

As a result, industry efforts toward developing rapid, sensitive, panel-based molecular diagnostics for respiratory pathogens have been aggressively pursued in recent years, and many are now commercially available (11) . One such assay, the Luminex TM xTAG RVP, was shown to be a cost effective option for respiratory pathogen detection and its use resulted in shorter hospital stays overall in Canadian hospitals (13) . This technology however is labor-intensive and requires proficiency in molecular techniques as well as a dedicated amplicon room. For laboratories unable to practically adopt a complex multiplex assay, but interested in replacing viral DFA with molecular multiplex testing, the FARP is an attractive alternative. The major advantages to this system are the fully enclosed platform and the overall simplicity of the setup and performance. A separate molecular work area and molecular expertise are not required as a result of these attributes. Several recent studies have compared the FARP head-to -head with other real-time PCR platforms for overall agreement, and one study performed a clinical comparison in real-time for immunocompromised patients; however, this study provides a fully resolved comparison to DFA, the methodology likely to be displaced by FARP in most clinical laboratories adopting this technology (14) (15) (16) (17) . The FARP performed very well overall in this comparison study for all of the parameters tested. In fact, most of our agreement values were greater than those reported by Idaho Technology Inc (18) . Consistent with the findings of Rand et al., less than 2% of our runs failed, despite running the machines almost 24 h at a time; making the platform very robust for testing in the urgent care setting (16) . Several of these failures were due to malfunction of one FilmArray R machine that was replaced without further failures. After resolution of the discrepant subset, many analytes were 100% in concordance with DFA results. The majority of unexpected negatives were re-solved as \"true negatives\" by LDT, misinterpreted DFAs, or clerical errors in the freezer database. For many of the discrepant samples, the FARP detected unexpected positives that were not previously detected by DFA. Most unexpected positive results were verified by LDT, making the FARP a more favorable assay for all analytes except Adeno. There were three unexpected positive analytes detected in the Rhino-positive specimen cohort that are not reflected in the calculations in Tables 2 and 3 since the reference method for these other analytes (DFA) was negative during patient testing. Because the specimens were negative by DFA, they were reflexed to RVP testing; however, the RVP detected Adeno in two samples and 2009 H1N1 in one sample, none of which were detected by FARP. LDTs confirmed the presence of all three analytes. The concentration of virus in the 2009 H1N1 specimen was close to the calculated LoD of the FARP, which likely explains why this specimen was not detected.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 387, "end": 391, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 587, "end": 591, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1517, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1522, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1527, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1532, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1730, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1934, "end": 1938, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2688, "end": 2702, "text": "Tables 2 and 3", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Nine Adeno \"false negatives\" were positive by both DFA/LDT (n = 7) or RVP/LDT (n = 2). This suggests that the FARP may not detect each serotype of Adeno with equal sensitivity, because several of the specimens were clearly positive by culture/DFA and measured up to 2.5 \u00d7 10 10 copies/ml by the LDT. Though the concentration of some samples fell below the FARP LoD for Adeno, several of the samples were within range of the established LoD, which further suggests that the target nucleic acid sequence was not amplified. In fact, the FARP does not detect all Adeno subtypes (personal communication, Idaho Technology Inc.), a limitation shared by the RVP (19) . However, the agreement values for Adeno were consistent with those reported by Idaho Technology Inc. (18) . This analyte is troubling in its current performance, and we have adopted an algorithm that includes reflex to Adeno-DFA for all FARP negative specimens to allow for comprehensive detection of this pathogen. This approach would be appropriate for laboratories considering the FARP as a replacement for DFA. Alternatively, negative specimens could be submitted to a reference laboratory for LDT testing specifically for Adeno, though the turn-around-time is no longer favorable in this scenario. Two unresolved specimens were excluded from the FluB cohort due to a lack of consensus (DFA = FluB, LDT = FluA, FARP = Negative). There was no evidence of mislabeling to account for this discrepant result. Six specimens (four Para2, one FluB, and one 2009 FluA H1N1) were also excluded due to lack of specimen for repeat culture/fluorescent antibody stain or real-time PCR. For each of these discrepant results, the initial DFA result was not confirmed by the FARP. Thirteen samples showed lack of concordance between DFA or RVP and FARP after final resolution (Table 2) . Two Para1 specimens were DFA and culture positive upon reanalysis, one Para3 specimen was determined negative by both DFA and LDT, and one 2009 FluA H1N1 specimen was detected by DFA and LDT. One unexpected RSV-positive specimen was not confirmed when the pool and the individual specimens in the pool were tested by LDT.

Interestingly, the LoD values for RSV were comparably low for both LDT and FARP for viruses lacking polymorphisms in the targeted nucleic acid. Consistent with this low LoD, the FARP was previously shown to detect RSV samples that the RVP could not detect (16) .

As well, pooling did not have a negative impact on the assay's LoD for Bpert and Adeno. An inherent limitation of pooling clinical specimens for evaluation purposes is that failure to detect a target analyte may be masked by an unexpected positive of the same analyte from another member of that pool. For instance, if a pool includes FluA, FluB, RSV, Rhino, and hMPV, the FluB may be undetected in the intended patient positive; however, another patient could have an unexpected FluB co-infection (previously undetected) that may be detected. In the final run output, this scenario would not be appreciated, and could skew agreement statistics. Due to our high numbers of discrepant samples, we ran multiple pools individually as single specimens for resolution purposes and only encountered this hypothetical scenario once with a Rhino specimen.
