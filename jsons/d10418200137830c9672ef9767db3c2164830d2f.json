Over the next few months SARS rapidly spread throughout China, leap-frogged to Hong Kong, and from there spread by global air to every continent and 29 countries. Along the way SARS infected more than 8,000 people and took at least 774 lives. One out of every two older persons who contracted the disease died. Additionally, it snarled global air traffic, cost billions of dollars, heightened political tensions, and brought home the message that cities in the global network are continually at risk for a serious microbe invasion riding along with the daily international exchanges of travelers, products, plants, and animals.",

It is in the local community that people fall ill and die. It also is in the local community that diagnoses are made, treatment regimes are established and implemented, and contagion is fought. Plagues typically overrun the normal capacity of community healthcare systems to respond, and without help from external expert systems such as the World Health Organization (WHO), local communities can suffer excessive casualties (Schwirian, 2005) . The timely arrival of help from external agencies and organizations is not automatically assured because responses to outbreaks of plague often become tangled in the morass of national and international politics (Fidler, 2004) . The WHO has taken on the role of being the chief agency that provides worldwide assistance to countries and communities as they battle overwhelming health crises. Nevertheless, WHO's ability to do its work depends on the willingness of national and local political regimes to request their assistance.",

In 1967, William H. Stewart, the then Surgeon General of the United States, told in a White House meeting of state and territorial health officials that we were at a health transition point -the killer infectious diseases were now well controlled and it was time to shift the focus from them to the chronic diseases (Garrett, 1995) .",

Concerns over smallpox, though, have been revived recently as some have seen it as a possible agent of bioterrorism (Bollet, 2004) . Nevertheless, in global public health circles it was thought that the victory over smallpox, as well as apparent victories over yellow fever, measles, and poliomyelitis, was a portent of things to come in the war against other serious diseases (Oldstone, 1998) .

This law builds on Stanley Milgram's (1967) small-world research that has come to be popularly referred to as ''six degrees of separation.'' Milgram showed that most people are linked together by only a few steps in their social networks. It is not that each of us is related to everyone else through the six intermediaries, but that in the chains of these relationships we become connected to ''funnels'' or persons with much higher-than-average connectivity. They link together social networks that otherwise would remain separate from each other. It is through these people that our individual network connectivity is multiplied. In epidemiology terms, these funnels are referred to as ''super spreaders.' ' We saw this funnel or super spreader phenomenon in the SARS-infected Chinese physician who came to Hong Kong. He stayed for one night in the ninth floor of Kowloon's Metropole Hotel. There his virus was contracted by 14 other people staying in the same hotel floor. In turn, by international air travel, the 14 brought SARS with them to several other cities in the global network. One of the 14 who contracted the disease from the physician was an airline flight attendant. She proved to be a super spreader. Over the course of the next few days, she single-handedly infected at least 100 other people and also earned the dubious distinction of being the person who brought SARS to Singapore.",

The longer one is contagious, the larger the number of persons one may infect. SARS has a high-stickiness factor. Its incubation factor goes up to ten days. Within that time period, a well-connected person may infect many others. For example, on January 31 a man in Zhongshan, China who had been ill for several days was admitted to hospital in Guangzhou. During his short stay he infected 30 people in that hospital. He was then transferred to another hospital where in a matter of a couple of days he infected another 26 people. In addition, over the course of his illness he spread the disease to 19 family members. So, single-handedly, in a few week's time, he spread SARS to at least 75 people. When the stickiness factor combines with the contact range of a super spreader, a lethal public health threat is created.",

Mallon became a major public health threat before she was quarantined for life after refusing to cooperate with health authorities and refrain from employment as a cook. Ironically, her last employment as a free person was at New York's Sloan Hospital where she infected 25 people of whom two died (Leavitt, 1996) . This was after she had already been quarantined for the first time and released. Disease carriers such as Mallon, whether of typhoid, AIDS, SARS, or some other infection, are very dangerous as public health threats because of their potential mobility among various social networks.

To break the chain of plague transmission, infected individuals must be isolated or quarantined from the general population. This is particularly important in outbreaks in which there are no sure curative treatments and no inoculations to protect those not yet infected. As long as infected persons are able to move freely, they pose a threat to the general population. Isolation of the infected and quarantine of people exposed to the disease are standard public health activities in the face of plague.",

This was met with a negative response in Canada's civil rights quarters. Lesley Jacobs, a professor of law and human rights at York University, stated, ''Quarantine infringes on civil and political rights recognized in international law and the legal systems of most constitutional democracies. My research indicates that senior public health officials in Toronto did far less than their Chinese counterparts to accommodate the rights and concerns of front-line health workers, quarantined individuals or SARS patients and their families'' (Connor, 2005) . To limit the use of patient isolation and quarantine of those exposed to the disease, and who are therefore potential additional victims, removes one of the most effective means of truncating the contagion.",

Today it is widely recognized that these cities not only are the focal points for business, political, and cultural matters within their society but they also serve as connection points to other societies. Indeed as Mark Abrahamson (2004, p. 2) has noted, ''the key nodes in the international system are (global) cities, not nations. y Once the linkages among cities became a global network, nations became dependent upon major cities for connections to the rest of the world.''

Third, the prospect of isolating the world cities from each other as a way to contain a plague is poor. There is simply too much riding on the daily exchanges among them.

The overall linkage between pairs of subnetworks depends on the extent to which one or two cities dominate the links of its cities to other subnetworks. For example, for years, all connections between Western and Chinese cities had to pass through Beijing. In effect, connections between U.S. and Chinese cities were shaped importantly by the decision makers in Beijing. So, the linkage between the city networks of the two countries was tenuous. This is somewhat less true today as individual cities in the two countries form economic and social ties. As we will see later in the discussion, Beijing's control of access to its network of cities served to exacerbate the problems created by the SARS outbreak.",

These concepts include nodes and ties. Accordingly, cities are the nodes in the network, and ties are the relationships between them.

The first is the inside panel review in which participants in the event meet to self-assess their performance or to form a general group opinion of how the system performed in general. For a plague outbreak this is the typical hospital medical review. This took place in most hospitals that dealt with SARS patients. Usually, the results of these evaluations are kept confidential, and often they attribute no specific blame to individuals. Frequently, they praise members of the staff that performed admirably during the crisis. Often, they suggest organizational improvements that will elevate future performance when faced with a comparable medical emergency.",

Beijing fired both health minister Zhang Dejaing and Beijing city mayor Meng Xuenong for ''their'' poor handling of the SARS crisis.

For example, it stated that there were poor and ineffective links in the chain command in fighting the outbreak; there was inadequate contingency planning, poor infection control in the hospitals, and ill-trained hospital staff (SARS Expert Committee, 2003) .

It named several senior Hong Kong officials and hospital administrators for dealing poorly with the SARS epidemic. For example, Yeoh-Eng-kiong, Hong Kong's Health Minister was accused of downplaying the outbreak and withholding information from the public. Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun, former director of health was accused of not taking the outbreak seriously enough. Leong Che-hung, chairman of the Hospital Authority was accused of not having made a contingency plan to deal with outbreaks of the SARS magnitude. Yeong and Leong quickly resigned their posts. Margaret Chan resigned before the report was issued to work for WHO. William Ho, chief executive of the Hospital Authority, also resigned. Ho had contracted SARS, but that did not save his job.",
