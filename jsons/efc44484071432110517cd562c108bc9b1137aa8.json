Therefore, early identification of the infection and creating effective treatment plan are particularly imperative 3 4 .

Patients with increased SAA2, CRP2, SAA2/L2 and decreased L2 were more likely to have a worsening condition.Patients with decreased SAA2, CRP2, SAA2/L2 and elevated L2 were more likely to have improved conditions(table 4).To detect if the dynamic changes of studied inflammation factors were valuable in predicting the progression of disease, the authors used ROC curve analysis to calculate the AUC of the changes of SAA, CRP, L and SAA/L between the first and second time point, regarding recovering as negative whereas exacerbation as positive.

The results showed a significant correlation of SAA dynamics and patient outcome. Specifically, SAA3, CRP3, and SAA3/L3 levels continued to increase whereas L consistently decreased in exacerbating and deceased patients. While, the levels of SAA3, CRP3, and L3 were within normal ranges in recovered patients(table 5)The relationship between the dynamic changes of SAA, CRP, l, SAA / L and clinical outcome at composite endpoint In patients who were discharged/well recovered, from the first time point at admission to the third time point at composite endpoint, the levels of SAA, CRP, and SAA/L consistently decreased, but L consistently increased.

Of the CT scans performed at admission, 98.5% (130/132) showed abnormalities, and only two cases were normal. Of ten exacerbating patients, seven of them had the second CT scan showing the worsening of disease; Of six deceased patients, five of them had the second CT imaging showing the worsening of disease; Of six exacerbating or deceased patients, five of six had the third CT scan showing the worsening of disease. Additionally, all of deceased patients had CT scans showing the worsening of disease(table 7).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": ". Studies have suggested that patients infected with COVID-19 had a large amount of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, MCP-1 and other cytokines present in system, leading to the activation of Th1 cell. Compared with mild patients, critically ill patients may have more IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1, TNF-\u03b1 and other cytokines expressed, which boost liver cells to produce SAA16 17  .Patients with respiratory virus infection usually have clinical symptoms after 36 to 48 hours of infection, and SAA gradually increases and reaches to peak at 3-4 day post infection. During the phase of recovery, it is reported that SAA level continuously decreased and the decrease rate was faster than that of CRP18 . CRP is also an acute phase protein produced when infection occurs.CRP level rises rapidly and the rate of increase is positively correlated with the severity of infection. Lymphocytes, as the key element in immune response, have three types of cells including T cells, B cells, and NK cells. Huang et al. 16 suggests that patients with COVID-19 have a large amount of IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, and MCP released, causing the activation of Th1 cells, SAA, CRP, L, PCT, WBC, and PLT. These inflammatory factors can be used as indicators to reflect the body's response to infection. The authors of this study want to detect if these indicators have clinical value in COVID-19 infection. The results showed that in COVID-19 infection, SAA and CRP levels increased significantly, while L decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range, it was consistent with Wang D's results 19 . As the disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L gradually decreased, but PLT, WBC, and PCT were all within the normal range. In this study, SAA<10mg/L was used as normal clinical reference value. Of 132 patients, 123 patients had SAA level above 10 mg/L. Almost all severe and critically severe patients had SAA level greater than 10 mg/L, 12 of which were above 200 mg/L, suggesting that the SAA is a sensitive indicator for the severity of COVID-19. ROC curve analysis shows that AUC that from high to low is: SAA/L > CRP > SAA > L, suggesting that SAA/L is a reliable indicator in distinguishing severe COVID-19 infection cases from mild ones. Compared with the initial levels at the first time point, dynamic changes in SAA, CRP, L, and SAA/L levels at 3-5 day-hospitalization (second time point) and composite endpoint (the last time point) reflected the change of patient's condition.
