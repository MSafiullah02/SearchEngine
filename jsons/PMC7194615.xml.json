Even though, based on a reasonable mathematical model some scenarios can be drawn and serve as a warning on how the severity of one specific situation can evolve (Biswas and Sen, 2020).",

Nevertheless, even a good prediction model will start to deviate from the actual data in just a few weeks and, therefore, without any adjustment become useless for this task. The idea of this study is to provide a more realistic growth model of confirmed CV-19 cases to give anyone conditions to promptly evaluate how restrictive mobility actions (as, for instance, social isolation) are changing the virus growing rates.",
