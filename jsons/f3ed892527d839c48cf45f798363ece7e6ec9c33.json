Here we report a computer-aided analysis of the structure around the established or putative frameshift sites in a number of retroviral, coronaviral, toroviral, and luteoviral RNAs and two dsRNA yeast viruses. In almost all cases a stable hairpin was predicted four to nine nucleotides downstream of the shifty heptanucleotide. More than half of the resulting hairpin loops give rise to potential pseudoknotting with sequences downstream of this hairpin. Especially in the case of the shifty heptanucleotides U UUA AAC and G GGA AAC, stable downstream pseudoknots are present. Indications were also found for the presence of pseudoknots downstream of amber stop condons at readthrough sites in some retroviral RNAs.",

            "text": "Translational frameshifting, although generally an abortive event during protein synthesis, is employed by various retroviruses to express the pol gene, encoding the reverse transcriptase and integrase. Frameshifting occurs at a defined site in the overlap region of the gag and pol genes and results in the synthesis of a gagpol fusion protein (1, 2) . In some retroviral RNAs, e.g., mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA (3, 4) , a double-frameshift event takes place, leading to the expression of a third reading frame encoding a protease. The ribosome is generally shifted into the -1 reading frame, but a shift into the + 1 frame has been noted in one case for the related retroviral-like transposon Ty-1 (5, 6) . Studying the se-TEN DAM, PLEIJ, AND BOSCH quence requirements for ribosomal frameshifting during translation of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) RNA, Jacks and coauthors found indications for a mechanism in which simultaneous slippage occurs of two adjacent ribosome-bound tRNAs by one nucleotide in the 5' direction at the site of frameshifting. Comparison of the sequences at the known or suspected frameshift sites in reading frame overlaps of a number of retroviral RNAs revealed a consensus heptanucleotide, consisting of a run of three A, U, or G residues followed by the tetranucleotide UUUA, UUUU, or AAAC (7) .",

During the course of this work, strong experimental evidence was reported for the presence of a pseudoknotted structure downstream of the frameshift site in infectious avian bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA. This pseudoknot was shown to be essential for efficient frameshifting of the ribosome in the orfla/orflb overlap region (11) .

(manuscript submitted for publication). This program is able to predict pseudoknotted structures involving hairpin loops, also coined H-type pseudoknots (12) , and has been successfully applied for the prediction of a number of consecutive pseudoknots in the 5' noncoding region of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA (13) and of pseudoknots in various other viral RNAs (Pleij, unpublished observations) . Stretches of about 250 nucleotides surrounding the shifty heptanucleotide were analyzed. Because only stem-loop structures downstream of the shifty sequence appear to be important (7,l l), we have focused mainly on the sequence at the 3' side of the frameshift site. Some pseudoknots involving bulge loops or multibranched loops are not predicted by this program. We, therefore, searched for these structural elements by visual inspection of the sequences if the proper stem-loop structures were found, taking into account the rules that are imposed by the geometry of the RNA-A double helix. The characteristics of RNA pseudoknots and their prediction and detection have been reviewed (12, 14) .",

Essential fea-tures are the heptanucleotide sequence SH, where the frameshift takes place, and the stem region Sl separated from SH by the spacer SP. If pseudoknotting involves a simple hairpin loop, as depicted in Fig. lA , it is fully defined by the connecting loops Ll and L2 and the other stem region or \"tertiary interaction\" S2. Except for SH and SP, the symbols are derived from the nomenclature previously used to describe pseudoknots (12, 14) . Figure 1B shows a schematic presentation of the structure obtained after coaxial stacking of stem segments Sl and S2. A characteristic feature of the relatively simple pseudoknot illustrated in Fig. IA is that the hairpin loop sequence participating in the tertiary interaction borders directly on the stem region of the hairpin. We call this type of pseudoknot H. When examining the retroviral structures we have not restricted ourself to a search for this particular type only, but have included pseudoknots that meet the more general definition: a structural RNA element formed upon basepairing of nucleotides within a loop with nucleotides outside that loop (12) . An example of a more complicated pseudoknot is the one proposed for RSV RNA (see below).",

We have included a number of sites from the retro-, luteo-, corona-, and toroviral groups and two yeast viruses not discussed before. For nearly all sequences tested, the computer program predicted a very stable hairpin, starting four to nine nucleotides downstream of SH, in agreement with observations by others for RSV, MMTV, HIV-l, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV MAC) (4, 9) . Similar results were reported using a different RNA secondary structure-predicting program (11) . This particular stem Sl was the most stable stem present in the 250 nucleotides surrounding SH, except for the luteovirus barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) (15) and the transposable element gypsy (16) . In the latter two cases, it was the second best. In mouse intracisternal A particle (mouse IAP), such a hairpin is found if a G-A mismatch in S 1 is allowed (17) . S 1 was neither predicted by the program nor found by eye for the transposable element 17.6 (11, 18) and for the retrovirus SIVA~~ (10) . The latter has U UUU UUA as the shifty sequence, and the absence of this hairpin is not surprising in view of the experimental results obtained for HIV-l (8) (see Discussion). For HIV-2 and SIV MAC we have included for Sl the stems as proposed earlier (9) .",

The sequence conservation in all three viral RNAs is absolute, however, which means that covariations in the stem regions, which generally provide support for the proposed structures, are lacking here. The gag@ overlap region of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) contains a similar structure (25) . Inspection of the sequence in the corresponding overlap region in another type D retrovirus, SMRV-H (26), suggests a SH, as indicated in Fig. 2B . The SH is located at the same position as can be concluded unambiguously from a sequence alignment. Its sequence is identical to that of the three other type D retroviral gagpro SHs mentioned above. The length of its SP is seven nucleotides, and its hairpin shows a strong resemblance to that of the other three related retroviruses (e.g., SRV-1 Fig. 2A) . However, the formation of a H-type pseudoknot is not possible anymore due to the G insertion in HL and a U-to-C substitution in the complementary sequence downstream of the hairpin. Surprisingly, Sl now harbors a potential second SH, G GGC CCC, which in turn is separated by a SP of four nucleotides from the ideal H-type pseudoknot predicted by the program (Fig.  2B ). This possible second frameshift site might compensate for the loss of the pseudoknot after the first site. Whether G GGC CCC can function as a SH sequence obviously remains to be seen, let alone that a second frameshift site indeed is active in SMRV-H RNA. A similar situation was found in both SIV RNAs (see below).",

The hairpin found downstream of U UUC CCC in SIVMAC RNA is reminiscent of the one present in RSV RNA and in some other retroviral RNAs, and a potential pseudoknot interaction with the long, single-stranded region further downstream is possible (not illustrated). We note that the situation described here for both SIV viruses is analogous to the one described for SMRV-H RNA in Fig. 2B .",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are plus-stranded RNA viruses having large single-stranded RNA genomes with replication strategies different from retroviruses. However, it was recently shown for the coronavirus IBV that the overlap of the two open reading frames (orfla and orflb) of the putative polymerase gene contains the shifty sequence U UUA AAC, which is followed downstream by a pseudoknotted structure (7,10,11). Site-directed mutagenesis clearly demonstrated that the pseudoknot is involved in the very efficient frameshifting (25-30%). The program predicts essentially the same hairpin S 1 as proposed by Brierley and coauthors (1 l), but we propose a slightly different tertiary basepairing, which enables a better coaxial stacking of Sl and S2, and is typical for an H-type pseudoknot (Fig. 3) . This proposal is further supported by a comparison with the possible pseudoknot in the corresponding region of the related coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A-59 (40) . Covariations in both Sl and S2 already prove that the pseudoknot exists in both viral RNAs. This is especially clear for S2, where three of these covariations are found, including the G-A pair in MHV. Note that such a G-A pair also occurs in the otherwise perfect stem Sl in IBV. Moreover, the shortening of the MHV stem Sl at the top is compensated by the formation of an extra base pair (bp) in stem S2. It is further remarkable that the loop of the MHV hairpin shows an insertion of the stop codon triplet UAA, just in phase with the upstream orfla coding region. This insertion extends stem S2 with another 2 or 3 bp (see Fig. 3 ). The single-stranded UG(U) stretch left may be just sufficient to cross the deep groove over lo-11 bp (14) . We note that the 32-nucleotide-long connecting loop can be folded internally (not shown), but this does not interfere with the pseudoknotting itself. A similar structure is predicted for a member of the torovirus group, Berne virus (BEV) (40) .",

A potential candidate for a SH sequence in the right frame in the corresponding overlap region was found: G GGA AAC at position 1553 to 1559. It is followed after five nucleotides by a short but stable hairpin, which can form an H-type pseudoknot (Fig. 4) . The nucleotide sequence of the closely related potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) RNA also has a potential SH. Its position [1662-1668 in PLRVw*o (43) or 1768-1774 in PLRV sear (44) ] is identical to that of BWYV RNA, as can be concluded unambiguously from aligning both PLRV sequences with that of BWYV. Its composition, however, is rather different: U UUA AAU in PLRVwAG and U UUA AAU/C in PLRVscor. Moreover, Sl in PLRV is shortened by 1 bp, but even more striking is the substitution of the U residue in HL of BWYV for a C in the Wageningen PLRV RNA sequence. This substitution weakens the pseudoknot structure, if existing at all. It is tempting to suggest that the pseudoknot requirement is relaxed because of the transition of SH from U UUA AAC to U UUA AAU (see Discussion).",

A stable hairpin with the UAG codon in the loop was proposed as a secondary structure element that could play a role in the readthrough event (4752). Recently, studies using sitedirected mutagenesis around the gag-& junction indicated that this stem-loop structure is important for virus activity (53) . A similar hairpin is present in Moloney murine leukemia virus (MO-MLV) (52) . However, a role of this particular hairpin in the readthrough phenomenon is difficult to reconcile with the position of the amber codon in the loop region (see also 51) . Moreover, the hairpin appears not to be conserved in M7 baboon endogenous virus (M7) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV, results not shown), nor in spleen necrosis virus (51) . The computer program predicted other stable hairpins around the amber codon of FeLV and M7, which were not conserved in the other RNAs either. However, there is a structure motif that is conserved among all four viruses. We here note that one of the most stable hairpins possible in the entire FeLV genome occurs just downstream of the amber stop codon (54) . This hairpin is capable of forming a pseudoknot. The loop contains a long stretch of only Cs at its 3' side, which can form a very stable S2 with six G residues 18 nucleotides downstream of the hairpin (Fig. 5A) . We emphasize the strong resemblance of this potential pseudoknot with some of those present in viral RNAs showing translational frameshifting (see above). Moreover, the distance from the UAG stop codon to Sl (eight nucleotides) reveals another striking resemblance (see also Discussion). Comparison of the FeLV sequence with those of three other retroviral RNAs, having established or putative suppressed amber codons (47, 52, 55) , gives support to the proposed pseudoknot, though not in a decisive manner (Fig. 5B) . Note again the single A residue in Ll of AKV and M7, and also of MO-MLV, if C2255 indeed is a G residue, as was reported recently (53) .",

This search was inspired by the suggestion that a pseudoknot is involved in the frameshift event in the gag-pol overlap of RSV RNA (7) . Our data, which include viral sequences not tabulated before, indicate that 26 of the 38 overlap regions studied here harbor potential pseudoknots. These pseudoknots are always found four to seven nucleotides downstream of a heptanucleotide sequence, where the translational frameshifting was demonstrated or supposed to take place. There are only three exceptions-EIAV, FIV, and SIVMIAc-where SP is nine, eight, and three nucleotides long, respectively. Some of the pseudoknotted structures found were of the same type as described previously for noncoding regions of viral RNAs, in which the stretch of nucleotides from HL basepairing with a complementary region outside this hairpin borders immediately on Sl, enabling coaxial stacking of the two stem segments (pseudoknots of the H type, compare Fig. 1 ).",

The failure to find a hairpin or pseudoknot in the overlap of the latter is consistent with the finding that the stable hairpin in HIV-I RNA is dispensable for frameshifting (8) . These authors proposed that two broad classes of retroviral RNAs exist, differing in their mechanism of frameshifting: one class using a short linear shifty sequence (like in HIV-I) and the other using RNA secondary structure for efficient frameshifting (e.g., RSV and IBV). In principle, the second class may be divided in two subclasses: one harboring a hairpin, the other a pseudoknot.",

The number of base pairs in Sl was not found to be critical either. Two structural features distinguish an RNA pseudoknot from a classical RNA hairpin: the two connecting loops Ll and L2, of which the bases point into the deep groove and away from the shallow groove, respectively (57) , and the quasi-continuity of the double helix. Which of these features induces the ribosome to shift into another reading frame remains to be established, however.",

For IBV, changing SP from six to three or nine nucleotides, respectively, reduced or abolished frameshifting (11) . Spacing between SH and the structure involved in frameshifting thus appears to be critical. In this respect it is striking that the distance between the amber stop codon and the pseudoknot at readthrough sites is almost equal to SP in frameshifting. The stem Sl as originally proposed for RSV RNA is in fact an exception, in that it starts immediately downstream of SH, forming a 14-bp stem, including a bulged C residue (7) . We have chosen to disrupt 5 bp up to the bulged C residue, which leaves an SP of six nucleotides. The latter value is in the range of that of all the viral RNAs (see Table 1 ). Moreover, mutations in this six-nucleotide stretch did not alter the frameshift efficiency (7), which argues against the importance of the bottom part of the stem proposed.",

            "text": "No correlation between the SP size and the presence of a pseudoknot became apparent in the present comparison, however. A comparison of the sequences of the SH heptanucleotides is more suggestive (see Table 1 ). Two sequences stand out in overlaps harboring a pseudoknot: G GGA AAC and U UUA AAC. It is tempting to suggest, therefore, that the sequence AAAC, where the tRNA bound to the ribosomal A site is shifting, has to be followed by an elaborate RNA structure. The first three nucleotides of the SH heptanucleotide, however, play an additional role, as can be concluded from the group with the A AAA AAC sequence, which has some members for which potential pseudoknotting could not be established. An important factor to consider further may be the presence of C and G residues in the SH heptanucleotide, leading to more stable codon-anticodon interactions. In this case a longer stalling of the ribosome may be needed to increase the chance of the slippage event. Such a longer stalling may be achieved by an extra structural feature downstream of SH. In this respect, it is interesting to see that pseudoknotted structures may be involved as well in the efficient readthrough of an amber codon. It is conceivable that a common basis for both mechanisms is the need for a stalling of the translating ribosome, which is pro-vided by pseudoknotted structures for reasons we do not yet know. If such a common basis is present, one can predict that a few changes in the nucleotide sequence around SH or the amber codon, respectively, could easily change a frameshifting viral RNA into one suppressing an amber codon and vice versa. However, first more information is needed about the actual requirement for amber stop-codon suppression of a downstream stem-loop structure or pseudoknot. The same holds true for a large number of viral RNAs having overlapping reading frames in which frameshifting occurs, despite the presently available data on RSV, HIV-l, and IBV.",
