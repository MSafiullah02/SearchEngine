MERS-CoV is a zoonotic infection with limited human-to-human transmissibility, and sporadic cases have sometimes led to clusters of infection. Influenza A(H5N1) is also a zoonotic infection, with a similar degree of human-to-human transmissibility in households as MERS-CoV.1, 2 On the other hand, human influenza viruses spread easily between humans, and large epidemics occur at least once per year in most countries. Zoonotic and human-to-human transmission of these pathogens could be affected by common factors such as meteorological factors (e.g., daily temperature and humidity), travel restrictions, and enhanced surveillance efforts. The practice of testing for either virus could also impact on detection of the other. It is therefore of interest to study the patterns of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in the Middle East and the global MERS-CoV cases.",
