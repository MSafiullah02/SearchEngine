            "text": "Given the magnitude and pace of the worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus, it is important to preemptively develop strategies for making a treatment available affordably, rapidly, and at scale. Appropriate strategies could avoid delays and inefficient policy decisions and ensure that stakeholders are incentivized to develop and roll out effective products. Organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, and Mastercard have already committed $125 million not only to accelerate the development of a COVID-19 therapeutic, but also to accelerate manufacturing and distribution of any such treatment. As stated by Bill Gates, any treatment for COVID-19 must be \"available and affordable for people who are at the heart of the outbreak and in greatest need. Not only is such distribution the right thing to do, it's also the right strategy for short-circuiting transmission and preventing future pandemics.\" 3 In this commentary, we define affordability in terms of \"being relevant if paying for all patients [who are] potentially eligible for a new treatment would force either an overrun of the payer's planned budget or a displacement of other treatments regarding as being cost-effective.\" 4 In the context of developing countries, affordability would be a particularly acute issue if a COVID-19 medication was very effective and would be required by a large patient population. Given the limited and short-term health budgets of most developing countries, any such new COVID-19 treatment would require that the country (1) forgo the opportunity to access the new COVID-19 treatment (as occurred in the early days of antiretroviral therapy for HIV in most developing countries), (2) discontinue offering other cost-effective treatment program to access the new COVID-19 treatment, or (3) identify external sources of funding that could pay for the new COVID-19 treatment.",

Remdesivir had apparent success in treating a 35-year-old COVID-19 patient with pneumonia in Washington state. 5 An analysis of 53 patients receiving remdesivir for compassionate use showed that 36 of them (68%) had clinical improvements, although the results are difficult to generalize given the lack of a control population. 6 A subsequent trial conducted by the National Institutes of Health found that remdesivir was effective in reducing the length of hospitalization and might decrease the mortality of patients with COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir also seemed to be successful in treating a 62-year-old in Spain with COVID-19, 7 but a recently published trial suggests the drug may not be effective. 8 An early trial of favipiravir tablets among 340 patients found that the drug shortened the period to recovery while also improving the lung function of patients. 9 In the meantime, a range of other medications is being explored, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. 10 Another treatment approach entering trials is the use of antibodies (convalescent sera) from people who have recovered from COVID-19. This approach has been used previously, as long ago as the 1918 influenza pandemic and as recently as the 2014 Ebola epidemic. 11 The use of convalescent sera is dependent on local availability of sophisticated blood banks with apheresis capacity. Countries that have experienced early epidemics could possibly scale up production, but it will always be a high-cost product. Even the production of monoclonal antibodies is inherently more expensive and more difficult to replicate, typically, than synthesis of small-molecule drugs.",

An ideal approach would maximize value globally, assure equity in access to treatment, and focus on those who are worse off. 13 The example of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) medications illustrates the challenges when a new treatment is discovered and launched, but there is no strategy for making it affordable in the countries most in need. Antiretroviral therapy was found to be a highly effective treatment for people living with HIV in 1996. Nevertheless, at prices of $10 000 to $15 000 per patient per year, it was unaffordable in African countries, where most infections were occurring. Antiretroviral therapy only became available in most African countries in 2002 (the launch of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) and 2003 (the start of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief). As a result, more than 5 years were lost because treatment was largely limited to developed countries. 14 Millions died as a result of an inability to provide affordable treatment during this time. This tragic lesson could be sadly relevant for any COVID-19 medication if affordability is not addressed immediately.",

Ideally, there would be a global mechanism that would simultaneously incentivize rapid development of treatments for COVID-19 and ensure very rapid and affordable access for the world's population. This will require compensating successful innovation and simultaneously unleashing global generic manufacturing capacity. Much has been written about these types of mechanisms. They typically resemble a large prize that is awarded to the innovator in exchange for the intellectual property rights (at least for low-and middle-income countries). For a pandemic of this sort, it might well be more efficient for the access to be universal, with set global prices (that would presumably be different depending on the wealth of the country) obviating the need for country-specific negotiations.
