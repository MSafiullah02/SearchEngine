            "text": "Genomic information of small eukaryotic viruses is typically encoded in a single-stranded nucleic acid filament (specifically, a positively-stranded RNA) rather than a double-stranded one, as is the case for larger viruses [1]. The very different flexural rigidities of single- and double-stranded nucleic acids call for different mechanisms of genome packaging inside viral capsids. Double-stranded DNA, which has a persistence length of  \u223c50 nm, is inserted into a pre-formed capsid by a molecular motor, and the mature virion has to withstand a significant positive osmotic pressure as a result [2\u20136]. On the other hand, single-stranded (ss)RNA has a persistence length of only about 1 nm, and its self-interaction and interactions with the capsid proteins are sufficient to drive its organization into a rather compact fold, inducing a small negative osmotic pressure [6\u201310]. Indeed, the sizes of wild-type (WT) ssRNA genomes of icosahedral viruses are usually only slightly larger than the space available inside the proteinaceous capsid of the mature virions [11]. This implies that only a modest additional compression of the ssRNA has to be imparted by the viral coat proteins that attach and assemble around the genome to form the capsid [6, 12\u201315].",

A follow-up study by Tubiana et al [16] further established that even relatively mild alterations of the WT sequence in the form of synonymous mutations can be as disruptive for the overall compactness of the genome folds as complete random reshufflings. These results indicate that, just as for specific local RNA structures [17\u201320] and phenotypic viral proteins, the global compactness of viral ssRNA genomes too has been optimised by evolutionary mechanisms [21]. In addition, both experimental and bioinformatics studies have indicated that a key recurrent and distinctive element of compact RNA folds is the presence of hubs with high-degree branching points in their secondary structure [22, 23]. These hubs are instrumental for the organization of the RNA fold into a floret-like structure composed of several local structural moduli (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\\end{document}\u22721000 nt long) [24, 25] and for the general control of the fold compactness [22].",

In particular, observations of Gopal et al [22] indicate that fold compactness seems to be encoded locally on a scale of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\\end{document}\u22721000 nt.

We mutate either continuous stretches (blocks) of nucleotides, spaced at regular intervals along the genome, or stretches of nucleotides sharing a similar distance relationship from the central branching hub of the WT fold. In addition, we also consider disperse mutations picked uniformly (stochastically) along the genome to provide a comparison with existing studies. Based on previous studies, one might expect that (local) mutations targeting the nucleotides closest to the central, high-branching hub of a fold would be the most disruptive for its compactness, and that disperse mutations would be, conversely, the least disruptive. Instead, we find that the exact opposite is true, indicating that the compactness of viral ssRNA genomes is encoded on a global scale.",

The nucleotides in the batches are picked according to three different mutation schemes described further below. For each batch we independently generate 100 mutated sequences using non-synonymous point substitutions that approximately conserve the characteristic dinucleotide frequencies of the WT genomes. More precisely, the frequencies are allowed to vary by no more that 37.5% from the WT reference values (see the supplementary material available online at stacks.iop.org/JPhysCM/30/084006/mmedia and [16]). Additionally, we verified a posteriori that the results we obtain in this way are largely unaffected by substituting the dinucleotide frequency constraint with that of mononucleotide frequency constraint, based on the Fisher\u2013Yates shuffling algorithm [35]. Moreover, we also checked that omitting half of the mutated sequences does not significantly change our results, as demonstrated in figure S1.

This runs counter to the expectation that the central hub and the corresponding high-degree branching points of the fold would be the most crucial regions where the sequence-structure interplay would stabilize the fold compactness. Instead, the most sensitive regions appear to be those of mid- to large distance from center\u2014and yet, even in these cases centrality-ranked mutations are not as disruptive as the random shuffling of the entire genome.",

Arguably, this strong tendency for the WT fold compactness has been evolutionary promoted as it facilitates genome encapsidation. From the point of view of the sequence-structure interplay in viral RNAs, several previous works have suggested that their compactness is largely due to the atypically high number of branching points, or hubs, of their genome folds [22, 23]. This led us to the question of whether the mutations that would specifically target either batches of nucleotides that are close to the central hub of the fold or batches that span continuous stretches of its sequence could be even more disruptive to the fold compactness than random mutations.",

Finally, we considered similar amounts of random mutations distributed randomly along the genome. We assessed the impact on compactness of each mutation scheme by computing the change in the MLD. The latter is a measure of the largest distance of any two nucleotides in the contact space of an RNA fold, and has been shown to be a robust proxy for the actual three-dimensional size of the RNA.",

Contrary to this expectation, our results clearly show that the largest disruption of fold compactness is caused by disperse mutations, and targeting nucleotides either in blocks along the sequence or in batches with various degrees of centrality in the structure has significantly less impact on the compactness of the WT genomes.",

Figures 6(a) and (b) show that while all mutation schemes produce folds with lower pairing probability than the WT one, only disperse mutations result in folds where the amount of base-pairing is significantly lower in both viruses. The number of high-degree branching points in the folds (defined as hubs with more than five branches stemming from them) is also almost unaffected by any of the mutation schemes, showing a slight decrease again only in the case of disperse mutations (figures 6(c) and (d)). Other quantities, such as the average duplex length and the number of duplexes in a fold, remain constant under different mutation schemes and compared to the WT folds. Consequently, while the reduced fraction of paired nucleotides clearly correlates with the increased impact of disperse mutations, it is difficult to argue that the change in any other structural observable could be behind our observed differences in the effects of different mutation schemes on the compactness of WT folds. It thus remains to be seen whether it is a combination of these characteristic features of RNA secondary structure, such as the number of high-degree branching points and pairing probability, that is encoded on a global scale of the fold and affected most strongly by disperse mutations, or whether there is a yet unknown global property of folds that is responsible for it.",

At the same time, we point out here two limitations that ought to be addressed in future studies. Firstly, while the MLD has been shown to correlate well with the experimental data on RNA compactness, it is nevertheless based on a simplified description of RNA folds as planar graphs. Restricting considerations to such classes of graphs is the de facto standard for secondary structure prediction methods, because they are clearly much more amenable to extensive numerical characterization. However, it is known that as RNA length increases, the genus of the native fold (a measure of topological complexity and non-planarity) increases as well [36]. Therefore, pseudoknots and other non-planar elements may definitely be present in the WT folds of phage MS2 and BMV [37\u201341]. Extending considerations, as well as the definition of MLD, to such cases is underway, based on the use of McGenus, a general (non-planar) secondary structure prediction scheme [36]. Secondly, for the sake of simplicity we have neglected other elements beyond MLD that are known to be important, such as electrostatic effects and the interactions of RNA with the capsid [42\u201344]. These should also be included in future extensions.",

Our findings clearly indicate that correlations due to sequence proximity help maintain the original properties of the fold under mutations to a much greater extent than in the case when the mutations are randomly distributed all along the sequence. Based on these results, we expect that further insight into the sequence-dependent robustness of viral RNA compactness could be gleaned from mapping out the reorganization of the network of secondary structure motifs due to mutations.
