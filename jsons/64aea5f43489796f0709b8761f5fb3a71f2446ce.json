The reproduction numbers for virus infection, antibody immune response, CTL immune response, CTL immune competition and antibody immune competition, respectively, are calculated. By using the Lyapunov functionals and linearization methods, the threshold conditions on the global stability of the equilibria for infection-free, immune-free, antibody response, CTL response and antibody and CTL responses, respectively, are established if the space is assumed as homogeneous. When the space is inhomogeneous, the effects of diffusion, intracellular delay and production delay are obtained by the numerical simulations.",

Mathematical analysis for these models are necessary to obtain an integrated view for the virus dynamics in vivo.

When a 1 > 0; a 2 = 0, the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response is simplified to Holling type II functional response (Li and Ma 2007) . And when a 1 = 0 and a 2 > 0, it expresses a saturation response (Song and Neumann 2007) . They obtained some criterion for the local asymptotic stability of the positive equilibrium of model (1) and gave the global stability of the positive equilibrium by constructing Lyapunov functions.

            "text": "Note that it is implicitly assumed that cells and viruses are well mixed, and the spatial mobility of cells and viruses has been ignored in model (1). Model (1) has been traditionally formulated in relation to the time evolution of uniform population distributions in a habitat and areas such governed by ordinary differential equations. However, as discussed by Wu (1996) , in many biological systems, the species under consideration may disperse spatially as well as evolving in time. The mobility of susceptible cells, infected cells and immune cells is further neglected under normal conditions, but viruses move freely in body in McCluskey and Yang (2015) , Gourley and So (2002) , Xu and Ma (2009) , Hattaf and Yousfi (2013, 2015) , Wang et al. (2011 and Zhang and Xu (2014) . They introduced the random mobility for viruses into model (1) and assume that the motion of virus follows the Fickian diffusion. Yang and Xu (2016) proposed the following virus infection model with spatial dependence v(x, t) and z(x, t) represent the densities of uninfected cells, infected cells, free virus and immune cells at location x and time t, respectively. The Laplacian operator and the diffusion coefficient are denoted by and D, respectively. It is demonstrated in model (2) that by constructing Lyapunov functionals and using LaSalle's invariance principle, the global stability of the model is established. More recently, the global dynamics of diffusive virus dynamic models have been studied in McCluskey and Yang (2015) , Gourley and So (2002) , Xu and Ma (2009 ), Hattaf and Yousfi (2013 , 2015 , Wang et al. (2011 and Zhang and Xu (2014) . During viral infections, the immune system reacts against virus. The antibody and CTLs play the crucial roles in preventing and modulating infections. The antibody response is implemented by the functioning of immunocompetent B lymphocytes. The CTL response has the ability to suppress the virus replication in vivo. Hence, an effective vaccine to prevent virus infection needs both strong neutralizing antibody and CTL responses (Balasubramaniam et al. 2015; Wodarz 2003; Yan and Wang 2012; . Therefore, some of the typical HIV infection models are described by delay differential equations, considering the dynamics of target cell, virus populations and immune response has been studied in recent years (Nelson and Perelson 2000; Yan and Wang 2012; Zhu and Zou 2009; Shu et al. 2013; Yuan and Zou 2013; Balasubramaniam et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2012 Pawelek et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2011; Ji 2015; Lu et al. 2015; Xiang et al. 2013 ). There are some models which include intracellular delay (Nelson and Perelson 2000; Yan and Wang 2012; Zhu and Zou 2009; Shu et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2012 Pawelek et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2011) ; some authors believe that time delays cannot be ignored in models for production viruses (Shu et al. 2013; Ji 2015; Xiang et al. 2013) . Therefore, it is more realistic to investigate delayed virus infection models with antibody and CTL responses and nonlinear incidences. However, to our knowledge, there are few works on diffusive virus dynamics model with time delay and adaptive immune response.",

Compared to the case without diffusion, the approach is to construct 5, h = 0.1, \u03c4 1 = 10, \u03c4 2 = 5, we have R 0 = 0.2087 < 1, the infection-free equilibrium E 0 (1000, 0, 0, 0, 0) is asymptotically stable Fig. 2 Taking \u03b2 = 0.15, c = 0.01, b = 0.2, g = 0.5, h = 1.5, \u03c4 1 = 3, \u03c4 2 = 15, we have R 0 = 3.0373 > 1, R 1 = 0.7098 < 1 and R 2 = 0.9277 < 1, the immune-free equilibrium E 1 (44.0253, 18.5544, 2.1293, 0, 0) is asymptotically stable Lyapunov functionals for partial differential equations (PDEs) or delayed partial differential equations (DPDEs) using Lyapunov functionals for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or delayed differential equations (DDEs). Research on diffusion will be more complicated. Moreover, all the five state variables are influenced by multi-time delays and diffusion can better impact the virus infection problems. Therefore, research in this paper can be seen as an improvement and a supplementary of model (2), and it might be helpful to understand 18, g = 1.5, h = 1, \u03c4 1 = 10, \u03c4 2 = 5, we have R 0 = 5.2164 > 1, R 1 = 3.3682 > 1 and R 3 = 0.8899 < 1, the infection equilibrium only with CTL immune response E 2 (114.8758, 16.0179, 0.6667, 0, 6.1420) is asymptotically stable Fig. 4 Taking \u03b2 = 0.35, c = 0.1, b = 0.15, g = 1.5, h = 1, \u03c4 1 = 10, \u03c4 2 = 5, we have R 0 = 7.3030 > 1, R 2 = 11.8885 > 1 and R 4 = 0.2854 < 1, the infection equilibrium only with antibody response E 3 (455.1241, 1.5000, 0.1902, 2.7868, 0) is asymptotically stable the virus infection model. Finally, under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, our results imply that diffusion, the intracellular delay and virus replication delay have no effect on the global behaviors of such virus dynamics model. Observing all obtained results in this paper, we can directly put forward the following open question which need to be further studied in the future. In this paper, we only discuss a five-dimensional diffusive virus infection model with intracellular delay, virus replication delay and general incidence rate. Based on different practical backgrounds, the immune response delay and mitotic proliferation terms for both uninfected and infected target cells are considered in modeling the viral infection of disease. Therefore, whether the results obtained in this paper also can be extended to five-dimensional diffusive virus infection model with mitosis transmission and immune delay. In other words, with immune delay as a bifurcation parameter, whether we also can obtain that the global asymptotic stability of equilibria for infection-free, immune-free, antibody response, infection with CTL response and infection with both antibody and CTL response, respectively, will also be a very estimable and significative subject.",

Hence, there is a positive root s 1 = gv 1 \u2212 h. When R 2 > 1, there is also a positive root s 2 = cw 1 \u2212 b. Therefore, when R 1 > 1 or R 2 > 1, the equilibrium E 1 is unstable.

From the LaSalle's invariance principle Hale and Verduyn (1993) , we finally have that the equilibrium E 4 of model (3) is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 > 1, R 1 > 1, R 3 > 1 and R 4 > 1. This completes the proof.Biologically, Theorem 3.5 implies that, if CTL immune response has not any delay, then the susceptible cells, infected cells, free virus, CTL immune response and antibody immune response can coexist in vivo.",
