In the last 60 years there had been 124,255 reported human rabies cases, an average of 2,037 cases per year. However, the factors and mechanisms behind the persistence and prevalence of human rabies have not become well understood. The monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health exhibits a periodic pattern on an annual base. The cases in the summer and autumn are significantly higher than in the spring and winter. Based on this observation, we propose a susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIRS) model with periodic transmission rates to investigate the seasonal rabies epidemics. We evaluate the basic reproduction number R 0 , analyze the dynamical behavior of the model, and use the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health. We also carry out some sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R 0 in terms of various model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is more reasonable to regard R 0 rather than the average basic reproduction numberR 0 or the basic reproduction numberR 0 of the corresponding autonomous system as a threshold for the disease. Finally, our studies show that human rabies in China can be controlled by reducing the birth rate of dogs, increasing the immunization rate of dogs, enhancing public education and awareness about rabies, and strengthening supervision of pupils and children in the summer and autumn.",

After entering the body, the rabies virus travels quickly along the neural pathways to the noncentral nervous system, from there the virus further spreads to other organs and causes morbidity by intruding many tissues. Infected individuals can experience incubation before showing symptoms. The incubation period of the disease is usually a few months, but can be as long as years, depending on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system. If the bitten location is near the head, the incubation is relatively shorter. The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu expressing fever or headache, progressing to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, fearing light and water within days. With the disease exacerbating, the infected individual may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia (CDC 2010b) . Once the rabies virus reaches the central nervous system and symptoms of the disease develop, the course of the disease is less than 10 days (CDC 2010b) and the mortality rate reaches up to 100%.",

It was shown that reducing dog birth rate and increasing dog immunization coverage rate are the most effective methods for controlling rabies in China and large scale culling of susceptible dogs can be replaced by immunization of them. Hou et al. (2012) proposed a similar dog-human interaction model considering both domestic and wild dogs and used the model to simulate the rabies data from Guangdong Province, China. It was shown that the quantity of stray dogs also plays an important role in the transmission of rabies.",

Seasonally effective contact rate (Dushoff et al. 2004; Schwartz 1992; Schwartz and Smith 1983; Smith 1983) , periodic changing in the birth rate (Ma and Ma 2006) and vaccination program (Earn et al. 2000) are often regarded as sources of periodicity. In this paper, we take periodic transmission rate into account based on the following facts. (1) In the summer and fall, people wear light clothing and are lack of protection for the bites or scratches of dogs. Also, in summer and fall people, in particular farmers, have more frequent outdoor activities which increase the chance of human-dog interaction. (2) In these seasons, dogs are more maniacal and apt to attack each other and humans. (3) From July to September schools are closed for summer vacations and children are out of supervision and enjoy tantalizing dogs. In fact, it was reported (Song et al. 2009 ) that 25.7% of human rabies cases in China are students and unattended children. (4) In addition, temperature may be related to the fluctuation of diseases. Under high temperature in summer, rabies virus can survive easily and its infectivity is stronger.",

We will evaluate the basic reproduction number R 0 , analyze the dynamical behavior of the model, and use the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004. We will also carry out some sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R 0 in terms of various model parameters. Moreover, we will show that it is more reasonable to regard R 0 rather than the average basic reproduction numberR 0 or the basic reproduction numberR 0 of the corresponding autonomous system as a threshold for the disease. Finally, we will explore some effective control measures for the rabies epidemics in China.",

We can write transmission rate \u03b2(t) in the general form \u03b2(t) = \u03bb 0 \u03b2 (N )\u03b2 /N , where N is the total number of dogs, \u03b2 (N ) is the number of dogs that a susceptible dog comes across per unit time, \u03b2 is the probability of getting bitten after interacting with the susceptible dog, and \u03bb 0 is the probability of being infected after bitten for the susceptible dog. We can express \u03b2 1 (t) similarly. As discussed in the Introduction, in the summer and fall there are more frequent interactions among dogs and between dogs and humans and these coefficients are more likely to change as season changes. Thus we use the periodic functions \u03b2(t) = a[1 + b sin( \u03c0 6 t + 5.5)] and \u03b2 1 (t) = a 1 [1 + b 1 sin( \u03c0 6 t + 5.5)] proposed by Schenzle (1984) to describe the transmission rates among dogs and from dogs to humans, where a and a 1 are the baseline contact rates and b and b 1 are the magnitudes of forcing.",

Then we calculate the average and divide it by 12 to derive the monthly human birth population B = 1,340,000. We need the initial values to perform the numerical simulations of the model. The number of the initial susceptible human population at the end of 2003, S 1 (0), is obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook and the number of the initial infective humans I 1 (0) is from epidemiological bulletins published by the Chinese Ministry of Health. However, the numbers of the initial exposed humans E 1 (0) and the recovered humans R 1 (0) cannot be obtained. We derive E 1 (0) reversely by the parameter \u03b3 and R 1 (0) is estimated roughly. Regarding the initial values for dogs, we only know that there are about 75 millions dogs in 2009 from online news. So, S(0), E(0), I (0), and R(0) are calculated reversely by the corresponding parameters r 1 , k 1 and data fitting.

We observe that R 0 is a concave function of k from Fig. 7(b) . So k has an obvious effect on R 0 . We also know that immunization is an effective measure to control rabies. Next, we consider the effect of \u03b3 on R 0 , which is depicted in Fig. 7(c) . We can observe that it is linear in \u03b3 . Most people, especially in the rural and remote areas, have little knowledge about rabies and even do not know what to do after being bitten by dogs. Song et al. (2009) reported that 66.3% of rabies victims did not seek medical services at all and 27.6% of the cases received inadequate PEP. Although the effect of \u03b3 on R 0 is less than k, we can enhance people the awareness and knowledge about rabies and the emergency measure and treatment after they are bitten and scratched by dogs to decrease the rate of clinical outbreak of rabies. Now we discuss how a effects R 0 in Fig. 7(d) . Although they are linear, a is very small and a slight change of a can lead to large variations of R 0 . Since \u03b2(t) = a[1 + b sin( \u03c0 6 t + 5.5)] = \u03bb 0 \u03b2 (N )\u03b2 /N , we can manage a by controlling \u03b2 (N ), i.e., the number of dogs a susceptible dog runs into per unit time, which is to strengthen the management of dogs, especially stray dogs, in case they run wild and bite each other and humans.",

In conclusion, controlling the population of dogs, reducing the birth rate of dogs, increasing the immunization rate of dogs, improve the management of dogs, enhancing the awareness of people about rabies, and combining these measures are effective measures to control rabies in China.

The data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health exhibit seasonal characteristics that the morbidity rates in the summer and autumn are much higher than in the winter and spring. In order to study the transmission dynamics of rabies in China, seasonality of the spreading of the rabies was incorporated into an SEIRS mathematic model with periodic transmission rates. Firstly, we calculated the basic reproduction number R 0 (Diekmann et al. 1990 ) and analyzed the dynamics of the model including the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the existence Table 1 do not change Fig. 8 The graph of R 0 in terms of (a) A and k and (b) a and k. Other parameter values in Table 1 do not change of periodic solutions. R 0 was calculated following the definition of Bacaer and Guernaoui (2006) , namely R 0 = \u03c1(L), where L is the next infection operator, which has been employed in some other studies (Bai and Zhou 2011; Liu 2010; Liu et al. 2010; Fig. 9 The fitting result of the tendency of the infected human rabies cases I 1 (t) using the corresponding autonomous system. A = 232,000, \u03b2 = 9.56 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , \u03b2 1 = 3.68 \u00d7 10 \u221211 and other parameter values are the same as those in the nonautonomous system. The oscillatory curve is the data reported and the skewed curve is the fitting result by the autonomous system Nakata and Kuniya 2010; Wang and Zhao 2008; Zhang and Zhao 2007) . In particular, Wang and Zhao (2008) generalized the techniques and results of van den Driessche and Watmough (2002) to periodic ODE models and provided a recipe to calculate the basic reproduction number. Their results also indicate that R 0 is a threshold value for determining the local stability of the disease-free periodic solution. We then used our model to simulate the monthly data on the number of infected human cases from January 2004 to December 2010 in China reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health and predicted the general tendency of disease in China. Moreover, we carried out some sensitivity analysis of parameters on R 0 . The demographic data were estimated from National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC 2009) . The values of most parameters in our model were obtained from the literature or by assumptions. The values of \u03b2(t), \u03b2 1 (t) and A were estimated through least-square fitting of I 1 (t i ) by discretizing the ordinary differential system as in Chowell et al. (2006) and Stafford et al.

By numerical simulations of our model, we found that the average basic reproduction numberR 0 overestimates infection risks. When A = 220,000 and other parameters values do not change, R 0 = 0.97 andR 0 = 1.17. Note thatR 0 = 1.17 predicts that the disease should be prevalent. However, the curve in Fig. 10 tends to zero. Furthermore, we would like to point out that Zhang et al. (2011) estimated that the basic reproduction number R 0 = 2, but in this paper, we calculated it to be 1.03 with similar model structure. This can be explained as follows. In Zhang et al. (2011) , the data adopted by model fitting were from 1996 to 2010. In this paper we only used the data from 2004 to 2010. From Fig. 11 , we can see that the numbers of infected human cases increased dramatically from 159 cases in 1996 and were fierce from 1996 to 2004. After 2004, the spread of rabies began to slow down. Moreover, the data in 2005 and after 2007 decreased. So the fact that R 0 in this paper is less than in previous paper is reasonable. We also would like to calculate the basic reproduction number for the nonautonomous system from 1996 to 2010. However, we cannot obtain the monthly data before 2004 since only after the SARS outbreaks in 2003 the Chinese Ministry of Health began to publish monthly data on various infectious diseases.",

Moreover, the nonautonomous differential system is different from and better than the autonomous model used in Zhang et al. (2011) . The dynamics, especially the basic reproduction number, are more complex. Thirdly, by comparing the basic reproduction numbers, we found that it is more realistic to regard R 0 rather thanR 0 or R 0 as a threshold to determine whether the disease can establish or vanish eventually. Finally, we concluded that human rabies in China can be controlled by reducing the birth rate of dogs, increasing the immunization rate of dogs, enhancing the awareness of people about rabies, improving supervision of children and students in the summer, and increasing the medical service and treatment such as PEP after bitten by dogs.",
