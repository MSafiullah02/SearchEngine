In the developing world, 95% of deaths are due to a lack of proper diagnostics and the associated follow-on treatment of infectious diseases; i.e., acute respiratory infections (ARIs), malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB) (1). Recent pandemics like the 2009 H1N1 Influenza A pandemic, have accentuated the need for tools to effectively detect and control infectious diseases. Factors like \u201crapid pathogen mutation rates, transformation of nonhuman pathogens into human pathogens, and recombination of nonhuman pathogen with human pathogens\u201d have added to the challenge of managing novel infectious diseases (2). Increased global mobility has aided the rapid spread of infectious diseases from region of origin to other parts of the world as seen during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. This mobility has highlighted the need for rapid, portable diagnostic (point-of-care [POC]) devices at ports of entry to prevent global spread of infections. Current laboratory culture methods for pathogens take a day or more to provide results (2). Clearly, methods need to be developed to aid rapid and site-relevant diagnosis of disease.",

Sub-Saharan Africa is a region heavily affected by the AIDS pandemic. The lack of standard laboratory facilities and trained laboratory technicians in these regions is a serious bottleneck (3). Similar problems exist in medically underserved areas of the USA. A simple POC platform could enable increased access to treatment for patients in such low-resource settings.",

The high speed analysis also makes microfluidics a suitable candidate for high-throughput applications.Straightforward integration of multiple components/functionalities (sample preparation, detection, data processing) on a single device.Potentially fully automated and simple to use, enabling use by laypeople.Portability and a small footprint should allow field and clinic use, as well as possibly allowing more widespread diagnostics. Pervasive diagnostics should greatly increase the likelihood of personalized medicine having a significant impact on society.Highly parallel analyses will allow multiple tests to be run simultaneously, either on the same sample or multiple samples. Microfluidic devices can in principle be used to obtain parameters like proteomic, metabolomic, and genetic data of each individual for personalized care (15).\n",

Rapid progress was made on these tools at this time and many of the developed concepts are still in use today. A summary of some of the best examples follow: Jacobson et al. reported separation of complexed metal ions in polyacrylamide-modified channels (17) using electrophoresis. Micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) separation of biological samples (18) and neutral dyes (19) were reported. Wooley et al. reported ultra-high-speed DNA sequencing and separation using microfabricated capillary electrophoresis chips (20). Surface passivation of silicon-based PCR chips to obtain amplifications comparable to conventional PCR systems was accomplished (21). Koutny et al. reported a competitive immunoassay for separation and quantification of free and bound labeled antigens by capillary electrophoresis (CE) (22). Hadd et al. presented an automated enzyme assay in which nanoliter volumes of substrate, enzyme, and inhibitor were mixed using electrokinetic flow (23). Microchip-based capillary electrophoresis (CE) for separation and relative quantitation of human serum proteins was achieved (24). Some of the other separation methods like free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) (25), capillary gel electrophoresis (26) and capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) (27) were reported. These devices were primarily fabricated in silicon and glass and lead to the work on related components like micropumps, microvalves and sensors.",

The first lab-on-a-chip emerged with the concept of a \u201cminiaturized total analysis system\u201d or \u03bcTAS, involving a silicon chip analyzer with sampling, sample pretreatment, separation, and detection functionalities embedded on an integrated system (30).

Seiler et al. reported amino-acid separation on chip and their detection using laser-induced fluorescence (32). Other applications involving biomolecules and cells emerged during the period.

The success of the microelectronics and MEMS industries in manufacturing thousands of miniaturized components in parallel at very low costs was thought to be applicable to microfluidics. While this may eventually prove to be true, low cost microfluidic devices made using photolithographic techniques have proven to be the exception rather than the rule, since the numbers of identical microfluidic chips manufactured for current and foreseeable markets tend to be more in the 10,000 s \u2212100,000 s, where batch processing does not provide sufficient cost savings. Packaging and other post processing steps like reagent introduction have also proven challenging and expensive, and consequently other manufacturing methods currently appear to be more in favor. Thus, while most of the earliest work in microfluidics was in silicon, the majority of current devices are now made in glass or a variety of plastics. Nonetheless, silicon and glass manufacturing technique are important in microfluidics, because molds for rapid and inexpensive manufacturing of plastic devices are still often made of silicon or glass.",

Microlithography involves the use of an energy beam to transfer a geometric pattern to a substrate. Depending on the type of energy beam used, these can be divided into: photolithography, electron beam lithography, X-ray lithography, and ion lithography. Photolithography involves using light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photo mask to a light sensitive chemical called photoresist. This is followed by a development process using a developer solution to create a positive or negative image of pattern onto the photoresist. Other techniques like X-ray lithography, extreme ultraviolet (UV) lithography, ion particle lithography, scanning probe lithography, and nanoimprint lithography are being increasingly used due to their capability in producing sub-100 nm structures. Of these, nanoimprint lithography, a type of embossing, is a low cost, high throughput and high resolution method that has the potential to be used for low-cost mass manufacture of micro and nanofluidic devices in a variety of materials, but especially for direct embossing of plastics (65).",

Six primary considerations have been behind this transition. First, silicon is relatively expensive compared to plastics because microfluidics tends to take up larger areas than microelectronic chips (and silicon costs are measured by area). Second, the electronic advantages of silicon are not typically required in microfluidic devices. Third, silicon is not transparent, so troubleshooting microfluidic devices during development can be difficult and optical detection techniques cannot be employed. Fourth, silicon processing typically requires processes found in expensive cleanrooms that are also relatively slow. The development of rapid and inexpensive polymer processing methods has proven compelling. Fifth, silicon is relatively brittle and is not ideal for devices that experience significant \u201chandling.\u201d Sixth, silicon is incompatible with the strong potentials used in electrokinetic pumping and capillary electrophoresis (CE). Silicon does have some advantages, such as well controlled surface properties, but these have not proven sufficient to drive microfluidic development.",

Many microfluidic components, such as pumps and valves, work better when fabricated in the less rigid polymer medium as compared with silicon. The permeability of polymer to gases make it suitable for work with living mammalian cells. PDMS, an optically transparent, soft elastomer has been used for various microfluidic devices since its introduction (10). Most polymer devices are made using a molding, embossing, or casting techniques, although direct processing means, such as laser-based or knife-based manufacturing is increasing (56). Soft lithography is the technique of replicating structures from a master mold or stamp onto an elastomeric (PDMS) substrate. Fabrication using PDMS is simple and does not require expensive facilities, and prototyping can often be done in less than a day. The reader can refer to in-depth reviews of soft lithography for detailed insight into the method (51, 52). Interestingly, not many commercial products use devices fabricated in PDMS due to a gap between academic and industrial practices, although this is starting to change (66). In addition, PDMS has limited application due to its hydrophobic surface and tendency to swell in organic solvents (67). Although polymers are the preferred material for most microfluidic applications today, silicon and glass are still relied upon for building specialized devices that need chemical and thermal stability (68). In the nascent field of nanofluidics, silicon and glass are used due to their mechanical stability (10). Some of other methods that are used in microfluidic fabrication are xerography (69), laser micromachining (70) and polymer stereolithography (71).",

We examine the microfluidic applications in diagnostics for diabetes, cardiac related conditions, and infections related to bacteria, virus, and HIV. We also review the applications in pharmacogenomics and devices for low resource settings. We discuss some of the methods used in fabricating these microfluidic devices and the challenges in mass production.

The major concerns in terms of DALY are infections due to viruses (HIV/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and viral gastroenteritis [rotavirus]); bacteria (cholera, tuberculosis, pertussis, tetanus, and meningitis); and parasites (malaria, Lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis). The three most devastating diseases are malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV. In 2009, there was an estimated 169\u2013294 million cases of malaria worldwide, resulting in about 781,000 deaths. Of these 85% of deaths were in children under 5 years of age [82). There was an estimated 14 million people infected with TB and about 1.7 million related deaths in 2009. TB is a major cause of deaths in HIV infected patients with about 380,000 of the 1.7 million deaths being reported in people with HIV (83). An estimated 33.3 million people are living with HIV worldwide of which about 67.5% live in sub-Saharan Africa (84). There has been an estimated 1.8 million AIDS related deaths, 73% of those being in sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, early infectious disease detection and management is a high priority in low-resource settings and a major driver of microfluidic diagnostic devices. Infectious diseases are not limited to developing countries. Recent outbreaks like H1N1 influenza A demonstrate the rapid spread of infectious diseases from a country of origin to the rest of the world. In April 2009, USA and Mexico reported 38 cases of H1N1 influenza. By June 2009 when World Health Organization declared a pandemic, there were a reported 28,774 cases and 144 deaths in 74 countries. The H1N1 influenza pandemic had a total of 43,677 reported cases in the USA as of July 2010 (85). Estimates of unreported cases are a much higher figure at 1.8\u20135.7 million cases (86).",

            "text": "The number of CD4+ T-lymphocytes per microliter of HIV-infected blood is a critical monitor of disease state and this measurement is needed to make informed antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment decisions. Therefore, the primary mechanisms for HIV detection in POC microfluidic devices are enumeration of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and HIV viral load quantification. To be successful, the POC device needs to detect around 200 CD4+ cells/\u03bcL and 400 copies/mL of HIV from whole blood (103). Towards this goal, Sia et al. reported a microfluidic immunoassay, \u201cPOCKET (portable and cost-effective)\u201d for quantifying anti-HIV-1 antibodies in the sera of HIV-1 infected patients. The device consisted of a PDMS slab with microchannels placed orthogonally to a polystyrene stripe patterned with HIV-enveloped antigen. The HIV-1 infected patient serum sample is flowed through the microchannels to quantify anti-HIV-1 antibodies. Although the device was able to identify the sera of HIV-1-infected patients from those of non-infected patients, it could not make a correlation of the output data with HIV disease states (103). Lee et al. developed a RT-PCR-based POC diagnostic chip for HIV. The chip relies on HIV markers p24 (a major core protein encoded by the HIV gag gene) and gp120 (an external envelope protein encoded by envelope gene) for diagnostic purposes (104). Cheng et al. reported a POC microfluidic CD4+ T-cell counting device. The device works in two stages, initial depletion of monocytes from whole blood and subsequent CD4+ T cell capture. The strategy of contaminant (monocytes) depletion prior to CD4+ T cell isolation enhances the performance in low CD4 count (200 cells/\u03bcL) scenarios (105). Other label-free CD4+ T-lymphocyte capture techniques have been reported. Although the microfluidic devices themselves are disposable and usually cheap, they still require expensive optical microscopes to count the captured CD4+ T-cells (106, 107). A lensless portable CCD-based microfluidic platform developed by Demirci et al. overcomes this limitation. The captured label-free CD4+ T-lymphocytes are detected by a charge coupled device (CCD) sensor using lensless shadow imaging techniques and counted using automatic cell counting software in a few seconds (108). Cheng et al. developed a non-optical method of counting CD+ T-cells. The cell count is enumerated by measuring the changes in conductivity of the surrounding medium due to ions released from the surface-immobilized cells within a microfluidic channel (109). Gohring et al. demonstrated the detection of CD4+ and CD8+ T-Lymphocyte whole cells and CD4+ T-Lymphocyte cell lysis using an optofluidic ring resonator (OFRR) sensor. This sensor measures the presence of T cells based on a change in refractive index in the microfluidic channel due to the presence of immobilized T cells (110). Wang et al. reported a microfluidic chip with an integrated micromixer for fluorescent labeling of CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and their subsequent counting using a microflow cytometer (111).",

An external optical detection module is used to analyze the optical intensity of the magnetic complex. The system displayed better performance than conventional flow cytometry systems in terms of limit of detection (114). However, the expensive external optical detection module could restrict its use in POC low-resource settings. Yamanaka et al. reported a microfluidic RT-PCR chip for rapid detection of influenza (AH1pdm) virus of swine-origin. A disposable electrical printed chip was used for electrochemical detection of the PCR amplicon (112). The electrochemical method is better for use in low-resource settings compared to the optical methods reported above due to the absence of expensive external detection units.

Legendre et al. reported work into the design and development of a microfluidic device for diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. The system accepts a whole blood sample as the input, extracts the DNA, amplifies target sequences of the T-cell receptor-gene, and eletrophoretically resolves the products for detection of a signature consistent with monoclonality (131). Diercks et al. demonstrated a microfluidic device that measured multiple proteins (tumor necrosis factor, CXC chemokine ligand 2, interleukin 6 and interleukin 1b) at pg/mL concentrations in nanoliter volumes. Antibody-coupled polystyrene microspheres labeled with embedded fluorophores were used to detect the analyte (proteins). Optical detection of captured analyte was performed off-chip using a confocal microscope, which proved to be a disadvantage in terms of lack of device portability (132). A similar fluorescence approach has been used to detect vascular endothelial growth factors in human plasma (133). An on-chip nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based biosensor was developed for the multiplexed identification of cancer markers (epidermal growth factor receptors EGFR and Her2/neu). The design consists of a microcoil array for NMR measurements, microfluidic channels for sample handling and a permanent magnet to generate a polarizing magnetic field, all integrated into a handheld device (134). Mass spectroscopy-based microfluidic detection of cancer-specific biomarkers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cathepsin D, and keratins K8, K18, and K19) was demonstrated by Lazar (135).",

Gervais et al. demonstrated a microfluidic device for one step detection of CRP in serum. The device works based on capillary action for fluid actuation and does not need any external power requirements (149), which makes it extremely useful in a POC, low-cost setting. A multiplexed cardiac biomarker detection prototype device was developed by Hong et al. The MEMS-based device detected four different cardiac markers viz. myoglobin, CRP, cTnI and BNP using Au nanoparticle-based fluorescence detection (150). Bhattacharyya & Klapperich developed a disposable microfluidic chip for detection of CRP including an on-board detection module (151). A microfluidic chemiluminescence-based immunoassay system for detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was reported by Cho et al. (152). Huang et al. demonstrated a microfluidic chemiluminescence-based detection sensor for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Super-paramagnetic microbeads were used to capture the biomarker (153). Use of magnetic microbeads results in higher surface to volume ratio for efficient analyte capture and enables on-chip actuation using an integrated electromagnet. A digital microfluidic platform detection device for cTnI was developed by Sista et al. (154). The fluidic actuation is performed by electrowetting, obviating the need for any off-chip fluid handling apparatus. SPR-based microfluidic detection of cardiac marker B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was reported by Kurita et al. (155).",

The lack of success is not due to problems with microfluidic devices; for example, drug screening requires high-throughput methods to find and test different drug candidates. Microfluidic high-throughput screening (HTS) techniques have been applied to drug discovery to perform thousands of tests in parallel with some success (162\u2013164). As of now these methods haven\u2019t been applied in microfluidic diagnostics for several reasons. Current diagnostics are typically performed in large hospitals or reference labs. In these labs, most tests are batched and performed using robots in a highly parallel, high throughput approach. Replacing these robots by using microfluidics is unlikely in the short term due to the large infrastructure already developed. Essentially, a solution to this problem already exists, so adoption of microfluidics for these assays will only occur if there are compelling assay improvements. In addition, if an assay can be performed in a batch mode using microfluidics, it is likely to be able to be performed in the clinic or POC setting, and for nearly the same price. Thus, microfluidics is likely to be driven to the POC rather than to large reference laboratories.",

A few examples of multiplexed screening have already been provided, especially for cardiac biomarkers, but highly multiplexed diagnostics are still being developed. Multiplexed screening is likely to have a more significant impact on diagnostics than high throughput screening, especially with the move towards personalized medicine. Microfluidics has been combined with microarray technology, which is used regularly in genomics and proteomics, and which will likely have diagnostic applications in the future; however, this is beyond the scope of the chapter. More relevant are microfluidic devices that can diagnose multiple diseases simultaneously. A recently released product that uses \u201cmesoscale\u201d fluidics can simultaneously diagnose 15 respiratory diseases associated with viruses (165). A challenge with getting the device to commercialization is that regulatory agencies such as the FDA require individual validation of each assay, meaning that multiplexing must clear very challenging regulatory requirements, which will likely limit substantial multiplexing in the near future. Nevertheless, microfluidics will probably lead to highly multiplexed assays that can perform 100s or 1,000s of diagnostic assays on one sample.",

In spite of immense academic interest in microfluidics and significant research investment directed towards both academic and industrial organizations, relatively few commercial products based on microfluidics have been introduced into the market (166, 167); however, the rate of introduction is increasing and many barriers are coming down. One of the reasons cited for lack of commercial success is the lack of a potential \u201cblockbuster\u201d end-user product that could generate billions of dollars in revenue. Until the industry can find a product with high volume demand, the fabrication costs due to lack of \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d are going to remain high. Existing materials like PDMS, which are hugely popular in research, have not succeeded in the industry due to issues with manufacturability and scaling (168). Most of the LOC products are still focused on the business-to-business segment and not the business-to-consumer (167). There needs to be more focused research on microfluidic product development including issues like manufacturability and cost dynamics and a simultaneous search for new application areas where microfluidics could be applied.

While the potential for these devices was first recognized more than 20 years ago, the realization of that potential has been slow, even though thousands of devices and methods have been published. The continuing development of applications and microfluidic manufacturing methods, including platform technologies that can be customized easily for each diagnostic test, will be the drivers of success. Very recent progress and an emphasis on global health has helped move the field towards POC devices that will likely become ubiquitous in the years ahead. While most microfluidic devices have one diagnostic target, devices capable of diagnosing 100s or 1,000s of diseases will likely be developed and commercialized in the next decade, making microfluidics a major driver of disease diagnostics.",

The heaters and thermocouples are shown with a manifold for on-chip fluidic control. The fluidic interface for the extraction system is designed so that it can be readily connected to the downstream assays such as hybridization and PCR.",
