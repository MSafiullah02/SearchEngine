It is also roughly the number of AIDS and malaria deaths combined in 1 year. Yet deaths in newborn babies are rarely mentioned in global-health priorities. A misconception has been that highly technical care is needed. On the contrary, our estimates suggest that up to three-quarters of these deaths could be prevented with low-technology interventions at an additional cost of less than US$1 per head for the 75 countries with the highest mortality.2, 4 What is needed is the political will to ensure that these interventions reach the women and babies who need them.3, 4 1 year on, we ask: what progress has been made over the past year in policy, in funding, and most importantly, in programmes in high-mortality countries?",

In Africa, various regional meetings of different audiences have profiled findings from the series. Mass media coverage of the series included articles in the five largest-circulation US newspapers, coverage in about 150 newspapers worldwide, and several radio interviews.",

Panel 1\n5, 8, 9, 10, 11 outlines some of the progress we have identified in profile, policy, programmes, and funding. We think deaths in newborn babies are now mentioned more on the health policy agenda, at least in child survival and maternal health circles\u2014as attested to by the attention received at the Countdown to 2015 conference in London, UK, in December, 2005.11 However, neither deaths in newborn babies nor in children or mothers appear on the agenda at high-level forums, such as the G8 summit, the Commonwealth Health Ministers meeting, and the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in which attention to health tends to focus on HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The World Health Assembly in 2005 also focused mainly on infectious disease emergencies, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).Panel 1Positive changes for health of newborn babies in the past year since publication of The Lancet Neonatal Survival Series\nProfile\n\n\u2022The World Health Report 2005 included a chapter on newborn babies and presented cause-of-death data for newborn babies, on the basis of estimates from the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group used in The Lancet series. In April, 2005, health of newborn babies had a high profile during World Health Day in New Delhi, India, and in the Delhi Declaration, which promoted a major shift from maternal and child health to maternal, neonatal, and child health\u2022The Millennium Task Force report included a prominent section on newborn babies8\n\u2022The Disease Control Priorities Project (National Institutes of Health and World Bank) added a chapter on health of newborn babies, towards the end of revising the second edition9\n\u2022Leaders of WHO, UNICEF, and World Bank have made public commitments to improving newborn health, including Ann Veneman, new Executive Director of UNICEF, in her maiden speech at the World Health Assembly in 2005\u2022India accounts for almost 30% of neonatal deaths worldwide. On National Newborn Health Day, the Indian Government issued a special stamp highlighting the health of newborn babies (figure) and the Indian Prime Minister has made a commitment to address this \u201cnational shame\u201d\n\nPolicy\n\n\u2022UNICEF's new health and nutrition strategy focuses on Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 and on increasing coverage of essential interventions, recognising the importance of survival of newborn babies for child survival goals. UNICEF previously had no programme guidance on the health of newborn babies, but has developed a policy entitled \u201cStrategic Guidance for Programming for Newborn Health\u201d\u2022WHO ran a workshop to increase capacity of regional and subregional child health advisers to support countries in incorporating newborn health into child health strategies (New Delhi, December, 2005)\u2022Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) materials, emergency obstetric care, and many other clinical and programmatic guidelines are being reviewed by various UN organisations and partners to incorporate or strengthen newborn health components\n\nPartnering\n\n\u2022The Partnership for Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Health10 was launched after the merger of three partnerships that worked together on the Comments for The Lancet series5\n\u2022The International Paediatric Association is launching a global movement of paediatricians for newborn health. At the African Congress of Paediatricians in Benin, in December, 2005, 27 African national paediatric associations signed up to join this movement\u2022The Norwegian Government has committed support for programmes related to Millennium Development Goal 4 in selected south Asian and African countries\n\nFinancial support\n\n\u2022World Bank funding for health-sector reform and strengthening now promotes an emphasis on health for newborn babies as well as mothers and children (eg, in a recent $250 million grant for health-system strengthening to Democratic Republic of the Congo)\u2022The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has provided grants of $60 million to Saving Newborn Lives/Save the Children-USA and $24 million to the Program for Appropriate Technology and Health (PATH), to advance survival of newborn babies in high-mortality countries\u2022The Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiative (GAVI Alliance) has earmarked $60 million for elimination of neonatal tetanus\n\nProgramme monitoring\n\n\u2022Inclusion of neonatal mortality rate as a Millennium Development Goal target has been recommended by The Lancet series steering team, and by task force on goals 4 and 5\u2022Tracking Child Survival Report, presented at Countdown to 2015 conference in London, included neonatal health indicators that were proposed in The Lancet series,4 and will be monitored by existing population-based surveys in high-mortality countries11\n\n",

There is wider recognition that midwifery training should include training in simple care and resuscitation of newborn babies, although challenges remain in health-system roll-out, including a shortage of competency-based training, a lack of supervision, few resuscitation dummies for training, and insufficient supplies of bags and masks. A companion volume on neonatal deaths and stillbirths is being added to WHO's maternal audit guide, Beyond the numbers. Work continues to improve the ability of verbal autopsy instruments in capturing deaths in newborn babies and identifying the causes of death. However, many issues remain unresolved in postnatal care\u2014there is no international consensus on the where, who, and what of care provided to mothers and babies in the first week after birth, when the risk of death for both is the highest.",

Interventions for newborn babies are now more commonly regarded as part of the funding for general health systems. For example, the World Bank is providing $250 million to the Democratic Republic of the Congo for health system rehabilitation, and interventions for newborn babies are part of the national package. The Department for International Development (DfID) and the US Agency for International Department (USAID) have funded maternal and newborn health programmes in Pakistan with about $250 million over 5 years. Spurred by a health policy review13 and the launch of The Lancet Neonatal Survival Series in Islamabad, the Government of Pakistan is launching a new 5-year programme on maternal, neonatal, and child health under a new cell in the Ministry of Health. In Bangladesh, a comprehensive national policy now supports newborn health, newborn health-indicators are included in the national health-information system, and 11% of the national budget for health training is allocated to care of newborn babies. India has increased spending on public health in 2006 from 0\u00b79% of the gross domestic product to 2\u20133% in 4 years, with most ploughed into the National Rural Health Mission to reduce the infant mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio.

The Road Map uses a systematic, stepwise approach to develop, accept, fund, and implement a national plan. Since its launch in 2004, at least 32 African countries have begun the process, and plans have been adopted in 12 countries, overseen by a regional task force. In some countries, health components for newborn babies could need review and strengthening, but the recognition and inclusion of care for newborn babies is an essential first step\u2022A large group of partners are working together to develop programme and policy guides, adapting approaches, and building capacity in organisations and countries. A publication, Opportunities for Africa's Newborns, is in preparation. This monograph will detail eight opportunities to integrate newborn care in existing programmes and provide profiles of 46 countries, plus a CD-ROM of relevant information\u2022In July, 2005, the African Union declared the acceleration of child survival, including that of newborn babies, to be priority\u2022Meeting of the First Ladies of West Africa at the end of 2005 included a presentation on survival of newborn babies\n",

The current wave of new community health workers will be most effective in saving lives if highly effective interventions for maternal, neonatal, and child care are the core set of tasks, and if the lessons of the first revolution in primary health care are applied\u2014ie, the need for supervision, close links with the rest of the health system, and remuneration.",

The Lancet Neonatal Survival Series contributed to some of these changes, but which and how much is difficult to tell and really does not matter. There is still much to do and high demand from countries for help to do it. The launch of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health provides new opportunities for maternal, neonatal, and child care. The real challenge ahead remains the provision of essential interventions to all mothers and babies, the integration and institutionalisation of interventions for newborn babies in programmes for maternal, neonatal, and child care, and the scaling-up of these programmes. We have much to learn about what works in different settings. This goal will need ongoing investment from countries and donors and should be seen for what it is: an investment in the health of the next generation. However, money is not all that is needed. Currently, too few people are involved and too little research is underway, in view of the size of the problem. We need more champions and researchers committed to asking and answering questions that can save many lives.",
