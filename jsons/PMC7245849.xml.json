As with any therapy, however, the use of NMBAs has inherent risks, particularly when providers are unfamiliar with the nuances of selecting the appropriate agent, monitoring the depth of neuromuscular blockade, and ensuring adequate skeletal muscle recovery once NMBA therapy has ceased. Optimal neuromuscular blockade management has challenged clinicians for decades, despite the frequent use of NMBAs in clinical practice [1]. Complications associated with the NMBA use can be particularly concerning in the critical care setting, as intensivists typically administer NMBAs to critically ill patients with multi-organ system derangements for long periods of time resulting in greater accumulation of NMB drug and drug metabolites. The impact of such \u201coff-label\u201d use of NMBAs in the ICU is still being investigated. The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) developed guidelines addressing optimal practice based on the available evidence to address these concerns [2\u20134].",

Unlike the OR where the primary objective of tracheal intubation is to secure the airway after induction of anesthesia, the procedural objective in the ICU is to secure the airway as a life-saving intervention in a patient with current or impending respiratory failure [7]. Endotracheal intubation in the critical care setting is associated with significant complications such as severe hypotension, hypoxemia, and even cardiac arrest [7\u20139]. Such complications can occur up to 25% of the time [10]. Moreover, when managing the difficult airway, the intensivist rarely has the option to awaken the patient during the scenario of \u201cfailed intubation\u201d as suggested by the American Society of Anesthesiologists\u2019 (ASA) difficult airway algorithm [11].",

            "text": "Nonetheless, the use of NMBAs is an important adjunct to facilitate tracheal intubation as these drugs can create better conditions during laryngoscopy [12]. In addition, the NMBA use can significantly decrease airway trauma associated with this procedure and facilitate securing the airway in fewer attempts [13]. Succinylcholine and rocuronium are the two agents typically utilized when the neuromuscular blockade is desired to rapidly facilitate tracheal intubation. While succinylcholine provides rapid and reliable neuromuscular blockade, higher doses of rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg or 4\u00d7 the effective dose that decreases the twitch by 95% from baseline [ED95]) can have a similar mean onset time (although a slightly wider range of onset times), a characteristic that makes this agent suitable for rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) [14]. Higher doses of rocuronium result in a much longer duration of action than succinylcholine, increasing concerns about its use in the patient with a difficult airway. However, high-dose rocuronium can be antagonized with sugammadex (at a dose of 16 mg/kg) after 3 min in the \u201ccan\u2019t intubate/can\u2019t ventilate\u201d scenario [15]. This pharmacologic reversal, however, does not ensure the avoidance of dangerous periods of hypoxia (or hypoventilation due to opioid or sedative drugs co-administered), and rapid, appropriate airway management targeted at establishing airway patency remains paramount [16].",

            "text": "In the ICU, NMBAs are also commonly used for the facilitation of mechanical ventilation. The current SCCM clinical practice guidelines [4] suggest that an NMBA be administered by continuous intravenous infusion early in the course of acute lung injury for patients with a partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio less than 150 (weak recommendation with moderate quality of evidence). Indeed, patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are unlikely to oxygenate or ventilate optimally with sedation/analgesia regimens alone. Gainnier et al. conducted a multi-center, prospective controlled randomized trial and found that the use of NMBAs during a 48-h period in ARDS patients was associated with a sustained improvement in oxygenation [26]. In the ACURASYS trial, Pappazian et al. found that in patients with severe ARDS, early administration of cisatracurium continuously for 48 h improved the adjusted 90-day survival, decreased the risk of barotrauma, and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness [27]. However, more recent results from the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial failed to show reductions in mortality when NMBAs were administered in moderate-severe ARDS [28]. While cisatracurium has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties in animal models [29], its clinically relevant benefit likely involves avoidance of ventilator dyssynchrony and improvements in lung compliance [4]. The results of three recent meta-analyses have all demonstrated that NMBA administration in ARDS patients is associated with reduced barotrauma and improved oxygenation; however, the impact on mortality remains unclear [30\u201332]. Thus, the NMBA use in ARDS must be individualized and may be utilized as a part of an institutional-based protocol.",

Neuromuscular blockade may be useful in the short-term without negatively impacting hemodynamic parameters such as ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and blood pressure [36]. Furthermore, the avoidance of coughing, straining, and ventilator dyssynchrony during periods of the neuromuscular blockade can avoid significant increases in ICP and worsening of cerebral edema [36, 37]. The benefits of NMBAs are limited to endpoints such as reducing oxygen consumption as well as carbon dioxide production, although this practice has not been shown to improve overall outcomes and may increase the ICU length of stay, risk of pneumonia, and overall costs [37].",

A complication from hypothermia is shivering, which leads to the deleterious consequences of increased metabolic rate and ICP, heat production, inflammation, and decreased brain tissue oxygen levels [42]. The American Heart Association guidelines recommend short-acting NMBAs in conjunction with appropriate use of analgesia and sedation to alleviate shivering in this setting [42, 43].

Its use is associated with skeletal muscle fasciculations after administration, and waiting at least 30 s after the cessation of fasciculations should provide optimal blockade for endotracheal intubation [68, 69]. Succinylcholine is a known trigger for malignant hyperthermia and causes a transient increase in plasma potassium levels by 0.5\u20131.0 mEq/L [70, 71]. This hyperkalemic response can be exaggerated in patients with upregulated extrajunctional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The proliferation of such receptors occurs in patients with prolonged immobility, acute burns, stroke with paralysis, spinal cord injury, demyelinating disorders, and even sepsis [72]. This feature is of particular concern in the critically ill patient as the duration of ICU stay has been correlated with the risk of hyperkalemia (potassium \u2265 6.5 mEq/L) [73].

Neostigmine should not be utilized to reverse moderate levels of neuromuscular blockade (train-of-four count < 1\u20133) but should be reserved for situations with the train-of-four count > 3 (Table 5).

This encapsulation process occurs in the plasma, creating a concentration gradient that facilitates the transfer of aminosteroidal NMBA from the neuromuscular junction back into the circulation. The tightly bound, inactive sugammadex-aminosteroidal complex is then excreted in the urine [77]. Sugammadex has the unique ability to reverse deep or profound levels of neuromuscular blockade and restore neuromuscular function faster than spontaneous recovery from succinylcholine [78], although this rescue technique should not supplant prudent airway management [16]. It is not approved for use in patients with a creatinine clearance < 30 ml.min-1; however, several studies have reported its use in patients with a significant renal disease without complications [79\u201381]. In addition, the NMBA-sugammadex complex can be removed via standard dialysis techniques [82]. Concern exists over hypersensitivity reactions following sugammadex administration [83]; however, the overall incidence of such events remains low and rarely impacts routine clinical care [84]. While not currently widely used in the critical care setting, its use may expand as new evidence emerges describing its use as a rescue therapy for residual blockade [85] and its role in reducing the incidence of reintubation [86] and promoting enhanced recovery protocols in the ICU [87]. In an effort to reduce the incidence of residual weakness and recurrence of neuromuscular blockade, we recommend dosing sugammadex based on actual body weight (rather than ideal body weight) and utilizing neuromuscular monitoring to confirm adequate recovery prior to extubating the patient\u2019s trachea.",

While the use of continuous NMBA infusions rather than intermittent boluses was reported to minimize the risk of prolonged paralysis [89], current guidelines also suggest that the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) can be a useful tool, when combined with other clinical assessment, to determine adequate neuromuscular blockade. Indeed, a PNS is utilized by a majority of institutions to guide neuromuscular blockade in the critical care setting [90]. While expert opinion has driven such implementation [91, 92], a large randomized, prospective study demonstrated that utilizing a PNS reduced the incidence of prolonged muscle recovery and the overall amount of NMBA administered [93]. Furthermore, the use of a PNS has been shown to achieve overall cost savings, primarily through less drug being needed to maintain the desired level of paralysis [94]. An international panel of experts recently recommended at least the use of a PNS whenever neuromuscular blockade is utilized, although quantitative monitors are the only means of reliably confirming recovery [95].",

Quantitative monitoring carries a distinct advantage over the use of a PNS in that it objectively measures and calculates the train-of-four count and ratio, rather than relying on visual or tactile assessment by clinicians. Transitioning from subjective evaluation to precisely measuring the level of blockade with quantitative monitoring represents a significant improvement in neuromuscular blockade management in the critical care setting and reduces inter-observer variability.

Acceleromyography (AMG) is the most commonly utilized quantitative monitor and relies on Newton\u2019s second law that states force is proportional to acceleration. By measuring the acceleration of the monitored muscle group, AMG devices can calculate the train-of-four ratio and confirm adequate recovery from neuromuscular blockade. Kinemyography (KMG) measures the degree of bending of a sensor strip positioned between the thumb and index finger after neurostimulation. Both KMG and AMG require the muscle group being monitored to move freely without restriction as they utilize integrated piezoelectric motion sensors to quantify the response to neurostimulation. Electromyography (EMG) does not require freely moving muscle groups, as it measures the electrical response of the muscle upon neurostimulation. This response is proportional to the force of contraction, without requiring an actual contraction. Because of this characteristic, EMG may be suitable for confirming recovery for the neuromuscular blockade in the critical care setting that commonly utilizes limb restraints (and in clinical settings in which the use of AMG- or KMG-based monitors is limited). Similar to using a PNS, EMG- and AMG-based quantitative monitors can also be utilized to monitor other muscle groups (facial, foot) if the hand is unavailable (Figs. 2, 3, and 4).\n",

While the use of processed electroencephalography (EEG) has been shown to decrease the risk of intraoperative awareness in high-risk surgical patients [101], current guidelines make no recommendations regarding the use of such technology in the critical care setting when NMBAs are administered [4]. However, we recognize that the utilization of processed EEG monitors at the bedside of ICU patients receiving NMBA infusions is becoming more common.",

Most notably, neuromuscular blockade results in prolonged patient immobility that can lead to the development of acquired weakness, myopathy, pressure ulcers, nerve injuries, and risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) [42]. Because the critically ill patient has an increased risk of DVT in their lower extremities compared with other hospitalized patients, special attention should be given to this potentially preventable complication [102, 103]. Boddi et al. found in their multivariate analysis that NMBAs were the strongest independent predictor for DVT incidence in the ICU [102]. Special care and consideration should be given to patients who receive NMBAs with regard to optimizing DVT prevention.",

ICUAW represents a heterogeneous term that has been used to describe varying conditions such as critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), and critical illness neuromyopathy (CINM), a diagnosis that is based on electrophysiologic testing. The etiology of such states is often multifactorial, and the reported outcomes are also heterogeneous. A recent meta-analysis suggested a modest association between NMBA use and ICUAW [107]; however, the studies that were included with a strong association have a high risk of bias, and the studies with the lowest risk of bias that performed multivariable adjustment suggested a small, but not significant association. Nevertheless, the authors\u2019 sensitivity analysis showed an increased risk of CIP in septic shock patients exposed to NMBAs, and consistent with previous studies [108, 109], the association may be proportional to the severity of the sepsis; therefore, the authors recommended to be cautious and target early use. Association between the ICUAW and NMBA use remains controversial. Well-designed trials should be performed to determine if the use of NMBAs is an independent cause of ICUAW.",

NMBAs have been known to cause adverse pulmonary outcomes [112] such as decreased inspiratory flow [113], residual paralysis [114], and impaired airway protective reflexes [99]. Such clinical features place patients at increased risk of upper airway obstruction, pneumonia, and reintubation. Identification of patients who may be at risk for adverse respiratory events was highlighted by Stewart and colleagues in 2016 [115]. These investigators found that > 30% of patients in the post-anesthesia care unit had residual neuromuscular blockade, and this risk was increased with older age, abdominal surgery, and surgery duration greater than 90 min [115]. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who receive NMBAs may also be at higher risk for postoperative respiratory complications compared to patients who do not have OSA [116]. While this risk stratification has not been applied to the ICU setting, such clinical predictors may prove useful and applicable in critically ill patients. Additionally, the use of a \u201cleak test\u201d has been proposed to identify patients at risk for post-extubation stridor that can result from laryngeal edema [117]. While the incidence of this complication has been found to be as high as 22% [118], a recent prospective, multicenter trial found it to be less than 10% [119]. Interestingly, these authors propose that the increasing use of neuromuscular blockers at the time of endotracheal intubation may be a contributing factor to this decline [119]. Regardless, vigilance is warranted following extubation as post-extubation stridor is a significant predictor of prolonged mechanical ventilation and prolonged ICU length of stay [120, 121].",

However, by understanding the pharmacology, dosing, drug interactions, side effects, and monitoring techniques, clinicians can safely maximize the benefits. As there are few prospective studies that support improved long-term outcomes for patients in the ICU, the administration of NMBAs should be limited to facilitating endotracheal intubation, prevention of shivering following therapeutic hypothermia, and avoiding increases in intracranial pressure in patients at risk associated with coughing or ventilator dysynchrony. Moreover, residual weakness following the use of NMBAs in the ICU is a particular concern, given this vulnerable population. This complication may occur more frequently in the ICU, given the abundance of patients with significant organ dysfunction and delayed drug (NMBA) elimination. We recommend continuous vigilance when NMBAs are used in critically ill patients, selecting the most appropriate NMBA for each individual clinical scenario, evidence-based protocols that ensure adequate sedation and analgesia, appropriate equipment for assessing the degree of neuromuscular blockade, and aggressive physical therapy regimens during periods of reduced mobility. Such a multifaceted approach can improve patient safety when NMBAs are utilized in the ICU and reduce associated complications.",
