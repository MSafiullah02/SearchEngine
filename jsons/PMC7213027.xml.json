The patient should then be shifted to the designated COVID-19 hospital as soon as possible for admission with prenotification and appropriate transfer method. (see details in the document)COVID-19 positive stroke patient should be managed in designated health facilities for COVID-19.Report of laboratory testing for COVID-19 suspect patients should be available on priority to guide the management.Appropriate protection should be provided to healthcare workers and patients as per standard guidelines. Limitations of PPE will require minimizing and optimizing staff on duty.Standard acute stroke treatment guidelines will apply to the management of patients. Individualized decisions will need to be taken for patients with a serious COVID-19 illness.Hospitals may consider designating a separate CT machine for acute imaging of a COVID-19 suspect or positive patients in the designated areas and appropriately sanitize the area after use as per standard protocols. Standard imaging protocols will apply. Optimize/minimize the use of MRI during this pandemic to reduce exposure to the staff and system.Intravenous thrombolysis in the absence of any major contraindication should be provided with either IV Alteplase or IV Tenecteplase in standard doses followed by post thrombolysis monitoring to all eligible patients.Mechanical thrombectomy should be provided to eligible patients with large vessel occlusion if the facility is available at the designated hospital. The challenge will remain for either designating a particular angiosuite if feasible or sanitizing the angiosuite used when treating a COVID-19 suspect or positive case. It will be prudent to discuss with colleagues and administration to organize the local needs as deemed best feasible. Standard PPE care is essential.Individualised decison regarding thrombolysis and endovascular stroke treatment may need to be taken in patients seriously ill due to COVID-19.The non-COVID-19 suspect or negative patients should be provided care in the designated stroke unit or inpatient unit.COVID-19 suspect or active patients have to be provided care in designated hospital areas only (till test reports of final COVID-19 status are available for suspected patients). Limitations of care may arise, but standard guidelines should follow for monitoring and advice. It may be prudent to educate the health care workers in COVID-19 demarcated area about stroke. Checklists and stroke protocols could be made available for these areas to follow and discuss with the stroke team.Telemedicine could be used for consultations between designated areas and specialty areas within or outside the hospital.Etiological evaluation should be focused on the most important components as deemed feasible. Appropriate secondary prevention should be provided.Rehabilitation is likely to be suboptimum and should focus on the most immediate needs of the patients. Tele-rehabilitation resources if available may be utilized.Discharge of stable COVID-19 negative patients should be planned early to minimize exposure and also reduce the burden on the health system. Discharge of COVID positive patients should follow standard guidelines.Telemedicine consultation should be considered for follow-up visits.\n",

More than one third may present with features referable to the central nervous system (CNS) including stroke. Moreover, neurological symptoms are more common in patients with severe infection, among them being ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and encephalopathy.[23] Among the 214 patients admitted in Wuhan, China, 78 patients had some neurological symptoms.[23] Cerebrovascular disease was observed in 6 (2.8%) patients and was more common among patients with more severe disease (5 out of 6 patients). In another study on acute cerebrovascular disease observed among admitted patients with COVID-19, ischemic stroke was the most common, and stroke occurred more in the elderly and middle-aged with vascular risk factors and 38% of them died.[34] COVID-19 is more likely to happen among people with some known vascular risk factors and also carries higher mortality amongst them.[5] In a recent metanalysis of 76993 patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease,[6] the pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, history of smoking, and diabetes were estimated as 16.37% (95%CI: 10.15%\u201323.65%), 12.11% (95%CI 4.40%\u201322.75%), 7.63% (95%CI 3.83%\u201312.43%), and 7.87% (95%CI 6.57%\u20139.28%), respectively. Another systematic review also showed predominant comorbidities to be hypertension and diabetes.[7]",

This requires prompt treatment and decision-making and 24 \u00d7 7 preparedness for the hospitals to provide evidence-based care that is essential for good outcomes in ischemic stroke as well as other stroke subtypes [intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)]. The ongoing pandemic brings with it many challenges,[89] be it overwhelmed emergency rooms, manpower issues, screening issues, resource limitations, prioritization, creating more quarantine facilities, caring for our healthcare workers by the provision of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, and above all optimizing care in an acute stroke patient who is a COVID-19 suspect or positive. Even during a pandemic, acute stroke and a coronary event is still an emergency and requires a coordinated team effort that would be compromised in situations like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Even China reported a reduced functioning of stroke centers mainly due to fear of in-hospital cross infection and lack of experienced stroke care experts.[8] This calls for rapid planning and modifications of existing care paradigms and systems of care as per the healthcare guidelines without putting a burden on existing infrastructure. The concept of \u201cprotected stroke code,\u201d refers to the concerns related to preparedness for managing acute stroke and preventing healthcare workers and other patients from getting exposed to the virus.[9] Worldwide, even countries with highly efficient stroke systems of care are reporting patients, who after having an acute stroke have no idea whether to attend hospital and where to go for treatment due to the extant crisis. In India, this situation would be manifold given the already deficient stroke systems of care vis-a-vis the stroke burden.",

This concept has also recently been referred to as the \u201cprotected stroke code.\u201d[9] Since time is a critical component, we strongly recommend hospitals to plan with the neurology/stroke faculty, COVID-19 managing team, and hospital administration to designate appropriate areas/corridor for such patients, including separate imaging area, angiosuite area wherever feasible and possible in these hospital settings for emergent imaging and timely treatment. Healthcare personnel protection is recommended. The patient test swabs for SARS-CoV-2 should be sent emergently and depending on the results of the test, the decision should be taken to transfer the patient to the inpatient neurology unit/stroke unit from the designated isolation monitoring area. In case staff and exposure need to be minimized because of limited resources, telemedicine may provide a solution.",

The indications, contraindications, and additional recommendations for intravenous thrombolysis remain unchanged from the American Heart Association (AHA) 2019 guidelines and Indian Stroke Guidelines.[10111213] Adherence to guidelines is suggested.[24] Only the assessment of blood glucose must precede the initiation of IV thrombolysis in all patients. Other tests e.g. International normalised ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and platelet count may be necessary for some circumstances if there is suspicion of a coagulopathy. Evaluating platelet count in suspect or positive COVID-19 patients before IV thrombolysis is preferable given frequent cytopenia\u2019s seen in COVID- 19 infected patients. In light of emerging reports of COVID-19 patients presenting as strokes, it would be prudent to routinely perform D-Dimer for all patients during this pandemic.[2526] Dosing, the methodology of administration of IV alteplase and tenecteplase remains unchanged. Frequent blood pressure (BP) monitoring is essential with the aim to keep <180 systolic <110 diastolic. In the event of a shortage of nursing staff due to posting for non-neurological COVID-19 patients, continuous BP monitoring may be relied upon with less frequent (than recommended) manual BP testing for the first 24 h. Monitoring for complications and management of complications remains unchanged from the previous guidelines. Risk of antiplatelets, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) within the first 24 h after treatment with IV alteplase is uncertain and should be avoided unless there are other concomitant conditions for which such treatment will provide a substantial benefit or withholding such treatment will result in a substantial risk.",

Usual scenarios include a patient with intracerebral hemorrhage with or without intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and/or hydrocephalus, a cerebellar hemorrhage, malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction, or posterior fossa infarction with edema or a post thrombolytic bleeding. In the usual scenario, it would be a easy decision to operate. When dealing with a situation of COVID-19 positivity or high-risk situation where results are yet not available, the system has to be geared up to manage such emergencies. The systems of care will also need reorganization.
