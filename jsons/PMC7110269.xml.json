Though it was believed to be linked with Wuhan Huanan seafood wholesale market initially, now it is spread to more than 166 countries in the world, and it was declared as pandemic by WHO. Whole landscape of the disease has changed from epidemic to pandemic in just 45 days. Worldwide, 191,127 confirmed cases and 7807 deaths were reported as on March 18, 2020, indicating serious global public health concern (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200318-sitrep-58-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=20876712_2). Situational awareness in all levels for risk management is badly required to contain the spread of this deadly disease.",

The Chinese researchers found that the incubation period could be 24 days and asymptomatic carriers were evidenced to transmit the COVID-19 also. The incubation period may be as long as 0\u201324 days in some cases (https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/coronavirus-study-incubation-period/). The viral genomes, isolated from both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cell cultures, were sequenced using next-generation sequencing, and found COVID-19 virus was similar to betacoronavirus \u2018bat-SL-CoVZC45\u2019. However, the remarkable exception was the spike protein, which is only 80% similar to bat coronaviruses. The envelope spike protein plays major role in binding to receptor, membrane fusion, and transmission capacity. Interestingly, it was more similar to SARS-CoV with respect to receptor-binding domain [1]. Despite there are some variations in COVID-19 receptor-binding domain, it was suggested that COVID-19 might use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as cell membrane receptor similar to SARS-CoV [1]. ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.",
