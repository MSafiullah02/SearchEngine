[3] [4] [5] Tobacco smoking is a significant risk factor for both viral and bacterial infections of the respiratory system 6, 7 , with smokers five times as likely to develop influenza and twice as likely to have pneumonia 8 . It may therefore be an important factor worsening the impact of COVID-19. There is evidence from case series that smoking is associated with more severe disease, a greater risk of ITU admission and excess mortality in people with COVID-19 admitted to hospital 3, [9] [10] [11] [12] . However some reports have suggested that although smoking related disease is common in patients with COVID-19, current smoking rates in hospitalised patients are lower than would be expected from population smoking prevalence. While some studies have looked specifically at current smoking [10] [11] [12] others combined current and exsmokers 3, 9 , and smoking prevalence in these samples suggest data may have been incomplete. A potential protective effect of nicotine has been suggested 13 .",

As a consequence, extrapolation from this group to population risk is inappropriate. Smoking prevalence was lower in the tested group, 8.9% vs 11.0%, both values substantially below the UK population average and smoking prevalence was lower in those testing positive than those testing negative (7.4% vs 9.3%). This raises several possibilities. Firstly, it may be that smoking does reduce susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2, though the likelihood of developing symptoms and severity of disease in current smokers remains higher, according both to the whole population data and the fact that smokers testing positive were more likely to report hospital attendance. Data from a multinational study of 8,910 hospitalised COVID-19 patients indicate that smokers experience more severe disease and have worse outcomes, including an increased risk of death (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or non-smokers; OR [95% CI] 1.79 [1.29 to 2.47]) 4 .
