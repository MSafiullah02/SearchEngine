On February 11, 2020, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) officially named the novel coronavirus that caused this COVID-19 epidemic as \u2018severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u2019 [2]. As of April 5, there has been 1,267,174 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, of which 68,931 patients have died, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44% [3]. Coagulation dysfunction is one of the major causes for death in patients with severe COVID-19 [4]. Previous studies have shown that 71% of the patients who died have met the criteria set by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) for the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [5]. Therefore, the People\u2019s Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis gathered experts from the epidemic frontline of Wuhan to establish a committee to reach a consensus. This consensus includes an overview of COVID-19-related coagulation dysfunction, coagulation tests, anticoagulation therapy, replacement therapy, supportive therapy and prevention. There are 18 recommendations which are being used to provide guidance for relevant clinical work.",

            "text": "Novel coronaviruses belonging to the \u03b2-type coronavirus and SARS viruses both utilize the S protein to bind to an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 protein on the cell surface membrane, in order to enter into human cells [6]. However, the S protein trimeric structure of the novel coronavirus is more likely to bind to the ACE2 protein on the cell surface, resulting in the novel coronavirus S protein having a 10 to 20 times higher affinity to ACE2 when compared to the SARS virus [7]. ACE2, the main target of the novel coronavirus, is mainly distributed in the heart, lungs, kidneys, testes, and digestive tract [8]. Therefore, the pathological results showed that SARS-CoV were detected in alveolar type II epithelial cells, monocytes, digestive tract epithelial cells, distal renal tubulesepithelial cells, skin sweat gland cells, parathyroid and pituitary eosinophils, adrenal cortex cells, gastric parietal cells, pancreatic acinar cells and tracheal serous gland cells. Different from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 were mainly detected in alveolar type II epithelial cells and pulmonary macrophages, and partly in hilar lymph nodes, spleens and testes [9]. Coronavirus has an extensive tissue distribution, causing a high number of proinflammatory cytokines to be released, promoting a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), accelerating cell death in the lungs, livers, heart, kidneys and the adrenal parenchymal organs, which can ultimately lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [10]. As inflammatory reactions occur in the all organs of the body, the microvascular system is damaged, leading to abnormal activation of the coagulation system, which pathologically manifests as generalised small vessel vasculitis and extensive microthrombosis [9, 11]. Previous study has shown that an abnormal urokinase pathway can cause a SARS-CoV -induced lung injury [12], and suggested that the interaction between novel coronavirus, coagulation and fibrinolytic systems has a complicated molecular mechanism, which requires further study.",

A prolonged APTT indicates an abnormal quantity or quality of coagulation factors in the endogenous coagulation system, or the presence of anticoagulant substances in the blood. A shortened APTT indicates the hypercoagulable status. APTT can also be used to determine heparin dosage. 3) Evaluation of common coagulation pathways: thrombin time (TT) and fibrinogen. Prolonged TT and normal fibrinogen level indicates the presence of anticoagulant substances in the blood. Prolonged TT and decreased fibrinogen level suggest hypofibrinogenemia. 4) Evaluation of fibrinolytic system: D-dimers (DD) and fibrin degradation products (FDP). Increased DD and FDP suggests the fibrinolytic system activity. 5) Platelet (PLT) count: if the number of PLT decreases, the risk of bleeding increases; if the number of PLT increases, PLT are prone to adhesion, aggregation and release reactions, increasing the risk of platelet thrombosis.",

Professor Tang, an expert on the committee, conducted a retrospective analysis of the routine coagulation parameters of 183 patients with COVID-19, and found that plasma FDP and DD in non-survivors were significantly higher than those in survivors; PT and APTT were significantly prolonged [5]. A retrospective analysis of 138 COVID-19 patients by Professor Peng also confirmed that D-dimers increased after admission [16].

Presently, DIC is based mainly on the diagnostic criteria of the Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC) of the ISTH. The parameters of DIC diagnostic scoring system included PT, PLT, fibrinogen and DD. A score of \u22655 can be diagnosed as overt DIC and < 5 is diagnosed as non-overt DIC, which would need to be evaluated daily [17] (Table 2). In 2017, the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Group of the Chinese Medical Association Hematology Branch recommended the Chinese DIC scoring system (CDSS), which added the primary disease and revised the diagnostic thresholds [18, 19].\n",

If circuit anticoagulation is the goal, local anticoagulation or systemic anticoagulation can be used. If patient anticoagulation is the goal, systemic anticoagulation is recommended to alter the coagulation status for treatment of the primary disease. To avoid an increased risk of bleeding, the dose of anticoagulant drugs needs to be adjusted according to the patient\u2019s coagulation status.

Bleeding in severe COVID-19 patients with coagulation dysfunction is more common at surgical incision or ECMO intubation sites, in the nose and in airways.

It mainly manifests as thrombocytopenia, as well as venous and arterial thrombosis, and even death. Literature review shows that the incidence of HIT is approximately 0.1% to 5.0%, and the incidence is higher with unfractionated heparin use than with LMWH use [31]. HIT is mainly caused by platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin complex, which stimulates immune cells to produce PF4-heparin complex antibodies (i.e., HIT antibodies), which in turn leads to persistent platelet activation, activation of the coagulation pathway, platelet thrombosis, and fibrin thrombus. If a severe case of COVID-19 leads to a decrease in the platelet count at > 50% of the basal value and/or shows signs of arteriovenous thrombosis after an administration of heparin, the 4 T\u2019s score or HIT antibody can be used to diagnose HIT. The 4T's score is a validated clinical prediction tool for HIT, and it is composed of elements related to the degree of thrombocytopenia, the time to thrombocytopenia from heparin product exposure, the associated thrombotic complications and the concurrent presence of other potential etiologies of thrombocytopenia. A score \u2264 3 is classified as low likelihood of HIT, 4 ~ 5 is moderate, and 6~8 is highly possible.

Large-molecular-weight substances including autoantibodies, immune complexes, cholesterol, bilirubin, drugs and poisons, are removed from the plasma by PE [45]. At the same time, coagulation factors are supplemented to improve the coagulation status of the critically ill patients. Previous studies have confirmed that in septic shock patients using large doses of vasoactive drugs to maintain blood pressure, early plasma exchange can decrease the dosage of vasoactive drugs, remove inflammatory cytokines, reduce capillary leakage and platelet consumption [46, 47].",

However, succinyl gelatin can lead to an average CR reduction of 12% and an average peak time extension of 96%, with an overall tendency towards hypocoagulation [52]. As the fluid volume increases, coagulation dysfunction is further exacerbated because of dilution effect [53].

The balance between coagulation and anticoagulation are affected, resulting in additional depletion of platelets and coagulation factors [57]. Anticoagulant drugs that prevent coagulation in the circuit may also affect the patient\u2019s coagulation state, increasing the risk of bleeding-induced thrombocytopenia or inducing HIT [58]. Guru et al. [59] reported that thrombocytopenia occurred in 65% of critically ill patients who planned to receive CRRT, and thrombocytopenia occurred in another 20% of patients during CRRT. Patients with CRRT using heparin anticoagulation have more significant platelet decline than patients without CRRT using heparin anticoagulation. The 4 T\u2019s scores indicate that most patients meet the diagnostic criteria for HIT, yet their positive antibody rate is not significantly high [60]. Choi et al. [61] reported that the rate of thrombocytopenia in patients receiving ECMO is as high as 83%. VA-ECMO is more likely than VV-ECMO to cause thrombocytopenia, because of platelet consumption caused by membrane oxygenator induced vWF aggregation [62]. The incidence of HIT can reach 20% during ECMO. Most patients show positive PF4 antibodies when treated with ECMO. The diagnosis of HIT needs to be considered if the ECMO circuit is frequently abnormal, the platelets progressively decrease and there are high levels of PF4 specific IgG antibodies [63].",
