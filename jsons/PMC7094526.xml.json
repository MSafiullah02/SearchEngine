Per heifer, reducing first-calving age (FCA) by a month reduces the costs of rearing by $51 to $116 (Gabler et al., 2000; Mohd Nor et al., 2012). However, a reduced FCA might be associated with lower first-lactation milk production (FLP). This possible negative effect must be considered when making decisions on reducing FCA.",

In rearing experiments, 2 experimental variations will always exist, as growth rate will affect BW at first calving unless the FCA is changed accordingly (Mourits et al., 1997). The advantage of rearing experiments is the possibility of having detailed insights into growth and the time of insemination and time of calving. For instance, lowering the FCA with an accelerated daily gain during the prepubertal period is known to have a negative effect on FLP (Sejrsen et al., 2000; Le Cozler et al., 2008). According to a study by Dobos et al. (2001), this lowering can be offset by increasing the BW at calving. The disadvantage of such experimental studies is the relatively low numbers of animals and farms that were studied, which make generalization more difficult.",

As previous field studies have shown, lowering FCA by a month can reduce FLP by 56 to 60 kg (Pirlo et al., 2000; Dobos et al., 2001; Berry and Cromie, 2009), lowering FCA under 700 d with an equal daily gain among heifers can create total yield losses of more than 310 kg (Ettema and Santos, 2004) and lowering FCA below 2 yr of age can lower FLP by up to 0.6 L per day (Haworth et al., 2008).

First-calving age decreases with a high-energy and -protein diet during rearing (Davis Rincker et al., 2011). First-lactation milk production has been shown to increase with number of days of antibiotic treatment before 4 mo of age, increases in DMI during weaning, and increases in the amount of concentrate fed around calving (Svensson and Hultgren, 2008; Heinrichs and Heinrichs, 2011). First-lactation milk production decreases with morbidity due to calf diarrhea (Svensson and Hultgren, 2008) and with a higher number of days of illness before 4 mo of age (Heinrichs and Heinrichs, 2011).",

These farms were chosen to participate because they were regular clients of the University Large Animal Veterinary Practice (Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands). Each farm was visited once by a trained veterinary student in September or October 2010 for a survey including both the student\u2019s observations (e.g., on factors such as the cleanliness of the barns) and a questionnaire about young stock rearing management. The questionnaire included 98 questions related to young stock rearing management, with open-ended (n = 33), closed (n = 44), and semi-closed (n = 20) types of questions. They covered general information about the farm, colostrum, and milk feeding, breeding, diseases, healthcare, and housing. The questions about feeding, diseases, healthcare, housing, and cleanliness were carried out for 3 different age groups: from birth to weaning, from weaning to 1 yr of age, and from 1 to 2 yr of age. Some questions (e.g., on the cleanliness of the barn during inspection) used a 5-point scale. An outline of the questionnaire design is given in Appendix Table A1\n. The full questionnaire (in Dutch) is available upon request from the authors. For this study, the University Large Animal Veterinary Practice also provided the average number of animals on the farms in 2010 and the average age of first insemination (mo). The average number of animals on the farm was provided for different age groups: less than 1 yr of age young stock, between 1 and 2 yr of age, and more than 2 yr of age. For all heifers on these 100 farms from July 2003 to June 2010, the cooperative cattle improvement organization CRV BV (Arnhem, the Netherlands) provided milk production records and calving dates.",

This guaranteed that the heifers experienced the rearing conditions that were reported in the survey (autumn 2010). For 2 farms that indicated their rearing management changed dramatically since 2008, only heifers calved after January 1, 2010, were included. In one of the farms, data on FCA of the heifer was unavailable and further, in those 2 farms, data on FLP of the heifer was unavailable. Consequently, median FCA was determined for 86 farms and median FLP for 85 farms. The median FCA of the herd was categorized into 3 groups: \u226424 mo of age, >24 to <27 mo of age, and \u226527 mo of age.",

Incidences for both calf scours and BRD in this study were higher than earlier reports both for Norway and the Netherlands (Perez et al., 1990; Gulliksen et al., 2009). This could be related to the fact that the number of sick animals in the current study was based on the farmers\u2019 own estimations and not based on actual farm records. At the same time, as Dutch farmers are more known to underestimate disease incidences than to overestimate disease incidences (Huijps et al., 2008), it could very well be that the incidence of diseases has increased over time.

These management factors are the amount of milk given to unweaned calves, whether waste milk is given to calves, and the minimum age at first insemination (Table 3). Further, only a few rearing management factors were associated with a herd\u2019s median FLP. These management factors were the median FCA of the herd and whether calves were vaccinated against BRSV (Table 5). The near absence of management factors associated with the median FCA and FLP of the herd can be explained by several interconnected factors. First, the median FCA of the herd and the age of the heifers when farmers started first insemination were strongly associated. As rearing management on each farm can influence both growth and BW, farmers expect their heifers to be sufficiently developed at a certain minimum age. They, therefore, prefer to use age and not BW to determine the start of insemination. This risk-avoiding behavior may have masked the effect on median FCA and FLP of other management factors during rearing (such as colostrum management and disease incidences). Second, measuring the farmer\u2019s management is difficult and, with a relatively small number of farms (n = 86), could have resulted in the low number of statistically significant relations between young stock rearing management and FCA and FLP. In addition, data on several factors that can be seen as links between management and FCA/FLP (e.g., nutrition, feed intake, energy density and protein level, calving weight, and growth) were unavailable and, therefore, were not included in the model.",

Similar results have been shown in previous studies, which have indicated that a greater amount of milk is related to better growth and earlier insemination (Le Cozler et al., 2008; Svensson and Hultgren, 2008), which can result in a lower FCA. In our study, a lower FCA for the herd was also associated with not giving waste milk (Table 3). This finding may be explained by the fact that farms that did not giving waste milk were the farms that practiced good animal welfare (Vasseur et al., 2010) and good rearing management. This is supported by previous findings indicating that giving waste milk did not affect a heifer\u2019s growth during preweaning (Jamaluddin et al., 1996).",

Bovine respiratory syncytial virus is one of the causes for BRD, which from previous studies is known to reduce growth in heifers (Van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2002). As growth and BW at calving are related to milk production (Le Cozler et al., 2008), growth reduction due to not vaccinating against BRSV may explain the found reduction of median FLP of the herd. In addition, in a previous study, a reduction in milk production was found after an outbreak of BRSV on a farm (Beaudeau et al., 2010).",

            "text": "In this study, the association between FCA and FLP was studied by using both absolute FCA and relative FCA (Table 6). In previous studies using field data, FLP was explained by absolute FCA. For instance, in an Italian study, a change in absolute FCA from 29 to 24 mo reduced the 305-d FLP by 255 kg (Pirlo et al., 2000), whereas in the current study, this would be a reduction of 391 kg. To our knowledge, ours is the first study that explained 305-d FLP using relative FCA to reflect the development of each heifer relative to the management of the herd in which the heifer was raised. This required the assumption that within the same farm, heifers will have similar development because they were similarly managed. Rearing management can be reflected by median FCA of the herd and, therefore, a deviation in the heifer\u2019s FCA from the median FCA is thought to reflect the heifer\u2019s development relative to the herd\u2019s average. The advantage of using relative FCA was that it took into account that each farm in this study had a different rearing management strategy and, therefore, it was suitable to be used in a field situation. Lowering the relative FCA on a farm will reduce the rearing costs (Mohd Nor et al., 2012). However, when the FCA is lowered by earlier insemination without adjusting the management to ensure sufficient development, it will also lower the milk production at first lactation (Table 6). At the cow level, although a month lower relative FCA is expected to reduce the total cost of rearing by, on average, $77 per heifer (Mohd Nor et al., 2012), it creates additional loss in revenues by reducing milk yield by 90 kg in the first lactation. This means that with a net benefit per kilogram of milk of $0.32 (LEI, 2012), the reduced rearing costs from a month lower FCA should be adjusted to an estimated $48 per heifer. This was estimated to be 1.7% of the gross margin per cow per year (LEI, 2012). At the herd level, lowering the FCA will produce additional savings by reducing the number of replacement heifers needed (Mourits et al., 2000a). As our results also indicate, a higher relative FCA resulted in higher milk production (Table 6), but these higher benefits from milk production were associated with higher rearing costs. These results show that an economic optimum exists between rearing costs, FCA, and FLP, and, as a consequence, that decisions with regard to young stock management should be made with care.",

            "text": "In our study, the majority of the farmers (60%) indicated that age determined the moment of first insemination. The minimum age the farmers would like to start inseminating was, on average, 15 mo, varying between 14 to 16 mo (5\u201395% percentiles). This would indicate that the desired FCA would be 24 mo, varying between 23 to 25 mo (5\u201395% percentiles). The age at first insemination should be the result of a proactive goal in combination with (feeding) management that enables reaching the goal. However, it is our impression that the answers of the farmers reflected knowledge rather than a well-thought-out proactive goal. This impression is supported by the findings that young stock rearing is the least important element on Dutch dairy farms (Derks et al., 2012) and that the majority of Dutch farmers relate their rearing performance primarily to chronological target values instead of physiological target values (Mourits et al., 2000b). The lack of a proactive goal for insemination/FCA would mean that achieving a higher FLP at a lower FCA would be difficult because farmers would not actively work on adjusting the management and nutrition to ensure sufficient BW at calving. Previous studies have already stressed the importance of proactive FCA and BW at calving as the primary factors that influence FLP (Van Amburgh et al., 1998; Fox et al., 1999; Bach and Kertz, 2010). Unfortunately, in our study, as in other studies (Ettema and Santos, 2004; Le Cozler et al., 2010), that information was not available. Due to the lack of information on BW, nutrition, and growth, it was not possible to do a complete investigation on which factors influence the FLP.",
