These microorganisms are resistant to antibiotics, and commonly referred to as \u201csuperbugs\u201d. As a result of infection by these pathogens often involve considerable pain and suffering and many deaths. These infections are major problems and significant costs of modern health sector. Cleaning and disinfection are expensive and are not effective enough due to inaccessible areas. Since there is no way to force people to disinfect hands remains to introduce robots to disinfect\n[1].\n",

UV gained fame in the 1950s for helping to eradicate TB before fading in use in the 1960s with the proliferation of antibiotics and chemical disinfectants [2, 3].",
