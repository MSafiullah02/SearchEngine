Initially, these infections were thought to result from zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission; however, recently published evidence [2] and the exponential growth of case incidence show compelling evidence of human-to-human secondary transmission fueled by travel, with many cases detected in other parts of the world [3]. This geographic expansion beyond the initial epicenter of Wuhan provides an opportunity to study the natural history of COVID-19 infection, as these migration events limit the risk of infection to the time during which an individual traveled to an area where exposure could occur [4].

The time from hospital admission to death is also critical to the avoidance of underestimation when calculating case fatality risk [9].

In addition to empirically showing the comparability of COVID-19 to other disease-causing coronaviruses, the present study has also shown that the 95th percentile of the incubation period is around 10\u201314 days, indicating that a 14-day quarantine period would largely ensure the absence of disease among healthy exposed individuals.

However, our calculations have shown that adding more cases to the dataset even with uncertainty reduces both the variance of the estimates and selection bias, improving the fit of the distribution mean. Our estimates are in agreement with the report of Li et al. [2]. A recent study by Backer et al. [17] noted a similar finding in their analysis of the incubation period for 88 cases (including 63 Wuhan residents). However, the estimates of Backer et al. for the model that included Wuhan residents were subject to overestimation as the lower bounds for Wuhan residents\u2014who had unknown left exposure dates\u2014were fixed in their analysis. In contrast, we considered the left exposure dates for Wuhan residents as parameters to be fitted\u2014see [14] for details. Notably, our results demonstrated the overall benefit of using additional case data, even when some of exposure values were not precisely known.",

During the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, 2003, the time from illness onset to hospital admission was shown to have shortened as a function of the calendar time, gradually reflecting the effects of contact tracing [9]. It remains to be seen if this will be the case for COVID-19 as well. The time delay distribution between illness onset and hospital admission may also be negatively associated with the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a fully susceptible population [18].

However, the living cases include persons who were isolated\u2014in some cases more for reducing transmission than for treatment purposes\u2014while all deceased cases were admitted for treatment. In addition, deceased cases for whom information was available had onset dates closer to the beginning of the outbreak compared to the living cases, who mostly had onset in the latter two-thirds of January 2020. The time delay distributions from illness onset to hospital admission for cases reported later in the epidemic, when there was a more widespread recognition of the virus and a more prevalent social imperative for those with symptoms to seek healthcare, may differ from those of early cases [2].

First, the dataset relies on publicly available information that is not uniformly distributed (i.e., collected from various sources), and therefore the availability of dates relevant to our analyses is limited to a small, selective sample that is not necessarily generalizable to all confirmed cases. Moreover, given the novelty of the COVID-19 pneumonia, it is possible that illness onset and other event data were handled differently between jurisdictions (e.g., was illness onset the date of fever or date of dyspnea?). Second, our data include very coarse date intervals with some proxy dates used to determine the left and/or right hand dates of some intervals. Third, as the sample size was limited, the variance is likely to be biased. Fourth, we were not able to examine the heterogeneity of estimates by different attributes of cases (e.g., severity of disease) [16]. Lastly, as we only have information on confirmed cases, there is a bias towards more severe disease\u2014particularly for earlier cases. ",
