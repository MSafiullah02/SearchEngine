Although the incidence of transfusion transmitted HIV, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus has been greatly reduced since the mid-1980s, the threat of new or emerging pathogens, such as West Nile virus and the corona virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, continue to motivate research into an oxygen carrier which is free of infectious agents. Furthermore, episodic blood shortages and the gap between the growing transfusion needs of an aging population expecting access to increasingly sophisticated medical care, and the shrinking proportion of the public who are willing and able to donate blood, make a synthetic or semi-synthetic oxygen carrier a desirable adjunct to banked blood.",

A number of reviews have discussed various aspects of blood substitutes [1], [2], [3], [4]. This review will focus on the hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOC).",

It has a high capacity for O2; it lacks the numerous and complex antigens of the red blood cell membrane, hence it is universally compatible; it is a robust molecule which withstands rigorous purification and viral inactivation processes; it is stable under ordinary storage conditions; and its physiology was thought to be well understood, although time has shown that there is more to be learned. Thus, eight different companies embarked on the development of a HBOC in the 1980s and 1990s (see Table 1\n). To date, one product, Oxyglobin, has been licensed for veterinary use, while its sister product, Hemopure, has been approved for limited use in humans in South Africa. However, only three companies are still actively engaged in clinical trials of HBOCs (Northfield, Biopure, Sangart).",

It was in Phase III clinical trials in trauma, surgery and acute ischemic stroke when in 1998 the company halted further development. In both the stroke [6] and the trauma trial [7] excess mortality was observed among the patients receiving HemAssist compared to those receiving banked red blood cells. However, mortality was equivalent among patients receiving HemAssist or banked red blood cells in a trial in cardiac surgery [8]. A post-hoc analysis of the trauma trial failed to identify the reason for the unexpected high mortality rate in the HemAssist treated patients [9]. Subsequently, however, a study was published comparing resuscitation with normal saline or the same di-aspirin cross-linked hemoglobin tetramer as HemAssist in an animal model of traumatic brain injury [10]. The mean arterial pressure was higher and the cardiac output was lower in the hemoglobin-resuscitated animals. In addition, the cerebral O2 saturation was lower suggesting that O2 delivery was impaired, perhaps the result of a vasoconstrictive response to the HBOC.",

It has also been noted to have a pressor effect which correlates with increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased cardiac index. In a study of patients undergoing infrarenal aortic aneurysm resection, 27% of patients randomized to receive Hemopure intraoperatively avoided allogeneic transfusion compared to none of the patients receiving banked red blood cells, although the median number of allogeneic units used was not different [17]. Biopure also completed a Phase III study in non-cardiac surgery and submitted the data to the FDA, which requested additional data. Biopure has since proposed a Phase IIb/III clinical trial in trauma, although the study design has not yet been approved by the FDA [20]. Meanwhile, they have begun to explore another use for Hemopure as a cardioprotective agent in patients undergoing coronary artery angioplasty or stent placement and have completed enrollment in a clinical trial in Europe.",

The HBOCs under development all have vascular half-lives in the 18\u201324 h range, which is adequate for most acute care applications (i.e. hemorrhage and surgery). Most can be stored at 4 \u00b0C or room temperature for 1\u20132 years and none of them require any form of compatibility testing.

Although the observed systemic pressor effect of the HBOCs, which is generally mild, is not necessarily deleterious per se, the possibility that it reflects vasoconstriction is of concern particularly if it prevents effective perfusion of capillary beds and eliminates the benefit of increased blood pressure or increased O2 carrying capacity.

The rapid binding of nitric oxide (NO) to both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin [38] and the ability of the HBOCs, which are very small compared to intact erythrocytes, to move in the bloodstream into the RBC free zone close to the vessel wall [39], suggested that they may trigger vasoconstriction by scavenging the NO produced by the vascular endothelium thereby releasing its constitutive vasodilatory influence [40], [41], [42]. It was predicted that HBOCs with large molecular weights, which would not be able to extravasate into the subendothelial space very readily, would exert less of vasoconstrictive effect. However, the correlation of pressor effect and molecular weight is weak. Although a substantial pressor effect was seen with stabilized hemoglobin tetramers, such as the diaspirin linked hemoglobin (HemAssist), it was also present in formulations consisting almost entirely of higher order n-mers of hemoglobin with very little residual tetramer, such as PolyHeme and Hemopure [43], [44], [45]. The pressor effect also does not correlate well with NO affinity [46]. Therefore, NO scavenging does not seem to be the major mechanism whereby HBOCs exert a vasoconstrictive effect [47].",

Hemoglobin solutions are much less viscous than whole blood and insofar as the dilution of the circulating blood with an HBOC would lower its viscosity and systemic vascular resistance, it might be expected to improve flow, at least at a systemic level. However, events at the level of the microcirculation may not necessarily reflect systemic hemodynamics [48]. The endothelial cells lining small vessels appear to sense shear stress, a property of a moving fluid, which is directly proportional to viscosity [49]. A drop in shear stress (viscosity) triggers down-regulation of the production of NO by endothelial cells triggering vasoconstriction [50], [51]. This viscosity-dependent regulation of flow in the microcirculation has been demonstrated in several experimental systems [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57].",

This theory posits that terminal arterioles respond to local PO2 by matching flow to the perceived need. Paradoxically, excessive delivery of O2 at the level of the arteriole might be expected to trigger vasoconstriction, thereby impeding flow and oxygen delivery to the distal capillary beds. Oxygen delivery to the arteriole may be affected by the O2 content of the blood (which in turn depends on hemoglobin concentration and its degree of O2 saturation), the ability of hemoglobin to off-load O2 (determined in part by the P50 and Hill coefficient) and the ability of O2 to diffuse from the red cell, or oxygen carrier, to the vascular endothelium.",

Several characteristics of the HBOCs may affect their propensity to deliver O2 to the arterial wall. The presence of hemoglobin in solution is known to enhance the diffusion of O2 as well as its uptake and release [67], [68], [69]. HBOCs are distributed in the red cell free layer of the plasma close to the endothelium, shortening the diffusion path for off-loaded O2, as well as facilitating diffusion of O2 from red blood cells through the plasma toward the endothelium. Since the diffusion coefficient of a molecule is inversely related to its molecular radius, a molecule with a small radius, such as a stabilized hemoglobin tetramer, would have a higher diffusion coefficient for O2 than a hemoglobin conjugated to PEG which complexes with water and sweeps a much larger radius. HBOCs with high diffusion coefficients might be expected to deliver O2 to the arterial wall more readily. Accordingly, HBOCs with smaller molecular radii, and presumably higher diffusion coefficients for O2, have been shown to produce vasoconstriction and limit blood flow to distal capillary beds in several experimental systems [70], [71], [72].",

It might be expected that an HBOC with high oxygen affinity (low P50) would unload less O2 than one with low affinity and therefore be less likely to trigger a vasoconstrictive response [46], [64]. In one model system, vasoactivity was found to be greater in an HBOC with a higher P50 than a similar preparation with a low P50\n[46]. However, experiments in an artificial capillary system [70] and animals [71], [72] indicate that the diffusion properties of an HBOC make more of a contribution to its vasoactivity than the P50. Hence, the P50 seems to play only a secondary role in determining the vasoactivity of an HBOC.",
