These two biotypes exist in both types I and II (Tekes and Thiel, 2016; Jaimes et al., 2020). Like other RNA viruses, coronaviruses are prone to mutations. Few mutations in accessory genes and the spike (S) gene of FCoVs have been identified. The mutations M1058 L or S1060A in the S gene, that were initially thought to be a marker for FIPV, were recently associated to the ability of the virus to infect and replicate in monocytes and macrophages, representing a marker for systemic FCoV replication (Chang et al., 2012, Pedersen, 2014; Porter et al., 2014; Stranieri et al., 2018; Felten and Hartmann, 2019).",

The S gene of FCoV types I and II differ: FCoV type I harbors the original feline S gene whereas the FCoV type II acquired the S gene (along with other genes) from the CCoV during recombination events (Jamies et al., 2020). Moreover, because the S gene encodes for the spike protein, which is the protein most subject to evolutionary immune pressure, it is the most variable of the FCoV genes. Therefore, the S gene is also useful for genetic characterization of strains (Addie et al., 2003; Kipar and Meli, 2014).",

Sequence comparisons demonstrated that FECVs and FIPVs from the same group of cats were very closely related, while significant genetic variation existed between FECVs and FIPVs that were from different geographic areas (Pedersen, 2014). For a better understanding of pathways of infection dispersion, a phylogeographical analysis that allows reconstruction of the most probable place of origin of infections and flow of geographic spread of viruses has been developed (Lemey et al., 2009; Drummond et al., 2012). This approach has been used to reconstruct spatial and temporal dispersion of some highly variable viruses but, to our knowledge, has been applied only in one recent study providing insights into the origin of FCoV in Brazil (Myrrha et al., 2019). Phylogeographical analyses has never been applied for the reconstruction of FCoV origin in Italy.",

The range of FCoV origin date that was estimated by our analysis is also confirmed by a previous study indicating that FCoV is estimated to have diverged from alphacoronavirues in 1953 (Vijaykrishna et al., 2007) and by the absence of descriptions of the disease before 1950 in the USA (Pedersen 2009). Moreover, the description of FIP in cats from USA occurring years before cats from other countries suggests the likely American origin of the virus. Indeed, based on available data in peer-reviewed journals, the first descriptions of FIP in other countries have been reported almost twenty years after the US, with the first reports of FIP in 1969 in Canada and in Germany and worldwide starting from the 1970s.",

            "text": "The significant migration link that was observed by our phylogeographical reconstruction between the US and Germany during 1974-1995 is in agreement with the information on the first reports of FIP in Germany years after the US (Landes et al., 1984) and suggests that the virus likely moved from the US to Europe where it reached Germany. Evidence of North America being the source of introduction of FCoV in other countries has also been recently reported in Brazil (Myrrha et al., 2019). FCoV introduction in countries is likely by animal movements. It has been reported that major geographical movements of viruses that need direct contact for viral transmission mirrors those of animals and that key migratory or transport routes followed by host species could also be responsible for virus transmission in areas where the virus was previously absent (Chen et al., 2015). Indeed, FCoV transmission occurs by the fecal-oral route and requires the presence of FECV-infected cats shedding the virus in their feces (Addie et al., 2003). In the case of FCoV, animal movements between USA and Europe may have been linked to cat shows, that started in 1871 in UK and have been reported worldwide thereafter (Hornidge, 2002) or to animal movements for breeding purposes. It has to be kept in mind that during the Second World War cat breeds from Europe were almost extinct (Bell et al., 2012) and that after the end of the war cats were frequently introduced from the US, where American cat breeders had continued to develop cat breeds (Longeri M., personal communication). Moreover, cats movement may also have been linked to owners\u2019 movements. During the Cold War, thousands of American soldiers and their families were moved to Germany (Alvah, 2007) and it is likely that cats followed their owners. Indeed, air flight companies specialized in pet shipping have reported in their websites that at least from the early days of 1968 pets were flown between the US and Germany (Lauzi S., personal communication). However, further investigations are needed to confirm this hypothesis that may also account for the introduction of FCoV-infected cats by American owners in other countries where US personnel and families stationed for prolonged periods after the Second World War, like Japan.",

In the last decade, the presence of different significant subclades with few FCoV type I sequences collected from the same country (and from cities close to each other in case of Italian sequences), in a restricted period of time, likely represent recent networks in the local circulation of the virus. Results also suggest that in the last decade FCoV was mainly transmitted locally, confirming that FCoV trasmission requires a close contact with infected animals. Unfortunately, the only Italian cat living in a city far from the others, as well as the only Italian cat included in a subclade with foreign sequences (from cats from the Netherlands) were from two different catteries and it was not possible to establish their previous movements.",

Our results also suggest that in the last decade FCoV transmission seem to rely on different areas from which the virus spreads. A similar result was not reported in Brazil (Myrrha et al., 2019), where the FCoV 7b gene was used for the phylogeographical analysis showing high conservation of sequences.

Therefore, our results need to be confirmed analysing a higher number of FCoV sequences from Germany and other European countries that to our knowledge are not available in GenBank. It cannot be ruled out that pre-existing avirulent feline coronaviruses may have been previously circulating in Europe in healthy cats. These strains may have been undiagnosed because they were less prone to undergo biotype conversion and cause FIP and/or because risk factors associated to the outcome of the disease (Addie et al., 2009) were less present in European countries compared to the US. Indeed, the shift in the status of cats as pets after World War II, with number of pet cats greatly increased, has been identified as one of the principal factor for FCoV infection (Pedersen, 2009).",
