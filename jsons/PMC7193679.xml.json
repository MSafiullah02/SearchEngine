However, this simple rationale for seed tolerance to LN exposure has been questioned by the demonstration that intracellular ice formation in seed tissues during cooling to LN temperature is not always a lethal event. In pea seeds, the unfreezable water content, as determined from DSC heating thermograms, was found to be lower than the critical water content for freezing injury, i.e. 0.26 and 0.33 g H2O g\u22121 dry weight, respectively (Vertucci 1989a). Since then, it has been shown that embryos/embryonic axes of 3 desiccation\u2010sensitive seed species could tolerate the presence, to a certain extent, of freezable water in their tissues during exposure to sub\u2010freezing temperatures (Vertucci et al. 1991; Wesley\u2010Smith et al. 1992; Vertucci et al. 1995). However, with seeds of some species survival to LN exposure seems to be unconditionally dependent on the avoidance of intracellular ice formation: in soybean seeds, the high moisture freezing limit was shown to coincide with the unfreezable water content (Vertucci 1989a).",

However, it has been shown that there is a negative interaction between high cooling rates (i.e. direct immersion in LN) and low water contents on survival of lipid\u2010rich orthodox seeds to LN exposure (Stanwood 1987, 1989a, 1989b). Thus, the presence of lipid reserves in seed tissues appears to be another key factor involved in survival of seeds after exposure to ultra\u2010low temperature. To our knowledge, the influence of the amount and the composition of reserve lipids on the sensitivity of seeds to LN exposure have never been investigated.",

Successful cryopreservation of embryonic axes of several recalcitrant seeds has been achieved by lowering their level of desiccation sensitivity through the use of very high drying rates \u2013 i.e. the \u2018flash drying\u2019 technique (Vertucci et al. 1991; Wesley\u2010Smith et al. 1992).

With C. arabica seeds, which exhibit a very high sensitivity to rapid cooling to LN temperature (Becwar et al. 1983, 1997, 1998, 2000, 1999a), a slow precooling step (1\u00b0C min\u22121 to \u221250\u00b0C) prior to immersion in LN had a beneficial effect on seed survival (Dussert et al. 1997, 1998). Furthermore, it has been shown that sensitivity of whole C. arabica seeds to LN exposure was due to damage caused to the endosperm only, since all embryos extracted from frozen seeds after thawing developed into normal seedlings when cultured in vitro (Dussert et al. 1997, 2000). In the present study, experiments involving two cooling regimes down to LN temperature were carried out with whole seeds of 9 coffee species showing differences in desiccation sensitivity. To study whether intracellular ice formation was associated with freezing injury, the unfreezable water content of endosperm of seeds of these 9 coffee species was determined by DSC analysis. Moreover, endosperm lipid content and composition were studied to determine their influence on sensitivity of seeds to LN exposure.",

The water content of seeds (expressed in g H2O g\u22121 dry weight) was estimated using 3 replicates of 10 seeds and their dry weight measured after 2 days of desiccation in an oven at 105\u00b0C. The effect of desiccation alone on seed viability was studied after desiccation over 6\u201312 salt solutions, depending of the species, and desiccation sensitivity was quantified by the water content at which 50% of the initial viability was reached, WC50, using the desiccation sensitivity model developed in a previous study (Dussert et al. 1999). Exposure of seeds to LN temperature was performed after desiccation over K2SO4, KNO3, MgCl2, Na2CO3, NH4Cl and NH4NO3 saturated solutions. Before cooling, seeds were hermetically sealed in 10\u2010ml polypropylene tubes. The initial temperature of the seeds was around 25\u00b0C (room temperature). Seeds were either immersed directly into LN (rapid cooling treatment, average of 200\u00b0C min\u22121) or precooled to \u221250\u00b0C at 1\u00b0C min\u22121 prior to immersion into LN (slow cooling treatment), as described by Dussert et al.

Seed culture was carried out according to the method described by Dussert et al. (1998).

With one of the replicates of C. liberica and C. stenophylla seeds, zygotic embryos were extracted from frozen seeds after thawing and cultured in vitro according to the method described by Dussert et al.

Empty pans were also scanned daily before seed sample analysis to correct the baseline curvature. Seed samples sealed in aluminum pans were cooled to \u2212120\u00b0C at the maximal cooling rate of the apparatus (about 320\u00b0C min\u22121), then heated at 10\u00b0C min\u20101 from \u2212120 to +20\u00b0C.

In C. arabica, 3\u20135\u2010mg samples of total seed lipid extract obtained as described above were analyzed in triplicate in order to confirm the identification of an endothermic lipid transition in seed sample thermograms. Heating thermograms were analyzed for the determination of the temperature and the enthalpy of endothermic transitions measured. Transition enthalpies, expressed in J g\u22121 dry weight, were determined from the area above the baseline and plotted against seed sample water content, expressed in g H2O g\u22121 dry weight, for the determination of unfreezable water content. Two lines of regression were then determined for each species, according to the method described by Vertucci (1989a) for oily seeds. The heat of fusion of freezable water was estimated by the difference in the slopes of the two regression lines.",

In species of the first group, C. brevipes, C. canephora, C. liberica and C. stenophylla, no seed germination, and consequently, no seedling production, could be obtained after LN exposure, independently of the seed water content and of the cooling procedure. In contrast to species of group 1, with the 5 species of groups 2 and 3, C. arabica, C. eugenioides, C. racemosa, C. pseudozanguebariae and C. sessiliflora, seedlings could be recovered after LN exposure when seeds were sufficiently dehydrated (Table 1; 1, 2 for C. eugenioides and C. pseudozanguebariae, respectively; all data not shown for other species). For each of these 5 species, there was a specific water content above which no survival was observed after LN exposure. This threshold water content for LN exposure is named in this study the high moisture freezing limit (HMFL), and is indicated by a dashed line in 1, 2. With the 4 species of groups 2 and 3, where seedlings could be recovered after both rapid and slow cooling, the HMFL value was the same for the two cooling protocols (1, 2; data not shown for C. racemosa and C. sessiliflora). A high interspecific variability for the HMFL was observed within the five coffee species of groups 2 and 3 (Table 1): it ranged from 0.14 g H2O g\u22121 dry weight in C. pseudozanguebariae to 0.26 in C. eugenioides. In all species of groups 2 and 3, the HMFL corresponded also to the optimal water content for LN exposure. Regardless of the criterion used for survival assessment, there was a decline in seed survival after LN exposure with dehydrating seeds to water contents below the specific HMFL value (1, 2; data not shown for C. arabica, C. racemosa and C. sessiliflora).",

At water contents higher than 0.22 g H2O g\u22121 dry weight, a second endotherm (peak 2) appeared with an onset temperature of \u221220\u00b0C. With continuing seed rehydration, the size and the onset temperature of peak 2 increased and, at the highest water contents experimented, the peak 1 appeared only as a small shoulder at the end of peak 2 (Fig. 4). DSC analysis of C. arabica lipid extract revealed the presence of one main endotherm whose characteristics were identical to those of peak 1 of seed sample thermograms. Its onset temperature was of \u221211\u00b0C and its transition enthalpy of 43 J g\u22121, a value very similar to the transition enthalpy of peak 1 measured in dry C. arabica seeds if taking in account their lipid content (16.1% dry weight). Thus, peaks 1 and 2 were attributed to the melting transition of lipids and water, respectively. Even if the characteristics of the peak corresponding to the melting of lipids varied between the different coffee species studied, the unfreezable water content could be determined using the same method. Because the two events partly overlapped at high water contents, the sum of the areas of the two peaks was used for regression against seed sample water content as performed by Vertucci (1989a) in oily seeds.",

Seed cryopreservation studies involving determination of the unfreezable water content from DSC analysis are scarce. However, from these few studies, it can be established that some seed materials can withstand the presence of some freezable water during exposure to sub\u2010freezing temperatures, while others can not. It was first demonstrated with pea seeds that formation of intracellular ice crystals did not always limit survival (Vertucci 1989a). Vertucci (1989a) suggested that, below a threshold water content (about 0.33 g H2O g\u22121 dry weight in pea seeds while the unfreezable water content was of 0.26 g H2O g\u22121 dry weight), the ice crystals that form in pea cotyledons and embryos during cooling are too small to cause significant damage and do not coalesce during rewarming. By contrast, whole soybean seeds did not withstand intracellular ice formation during LN exposure (Vertucci 1989a). Since the shift in tolerance of soybean seeds to the presence of some freezable water in their tissues was observed in the range of temperatures where phase transitions of storage lipids occurred (between \u221230 and \u221250\u00b0C), it was suggested by Vertucci (1989a) that the interaction between storage lipids and water somehow promoted formation of ice crystals large enough to cause lethal damage. Seed lipid contents of the different coffee species studied here were of the same order of soybean seeds (about 20% dry weight). Thus, the present results are consistent with the earlier study of Vertucci (1989a) with orthodox soybean seeds, and confirm that intracellular ice formation seems to be lethal in lipid\u2010rich seeds, independent of their level of desiccation sensitivity. Furthermore, these data indicate that the unfreezable water content does correspond to the upper limit of the hydration window allowing the successful cryopreservation of such seeds. In addition, the susceptibility of seeds to the presence of some freezable water during LN exposure does not seem to be related to desiccation sensitivity per se because some of the seed materials that were shown to tolerate it, such as Landolphia kirkii (Vertucci et al. 1991) and Zizania (Vertucci et al. 1995) embryos, were also shown to be considerably less tolerant to desiccation than coffee seeds.",

            "text": "The second proposal, i.e. that the critical water content for desiccation sensitivity measured at room temperature does not correspond to the lower limit of the hydration window for LN exposure, is derived from observations and suggestions of Eira et al. (1999a). These authors observed an increase in the critical water content for desiccation sensitivity of Coffea spp. seeds with decreasing temperature from +15 to \u221220\u00b0C. A theoretical basis for this phenomenon has been proposed by Vertucci et al. (1994). This assumes that a single critical water activity determines the desiccation sensitivity of seeds of a given species. Since, at given water content, seed water activity decreases with decreasing temperature (Vertucci and Roos 1993, 1994, 1995), it is possible that the water activity of seeds cooled to \u2212196\u00b0C is decreased to a value lower than the critical water activity for desiccation sensitivity. Consequently, even if at room temperature the water activity of seeds desiccated to WCu is higher than the critical water activity for desiccation sensitivity, when frozen these seeds undergo desiccation damage. The relationship between the water activity, aw, and the temperature, T (in Kelvin), is described by the following equation derived from the van't Hoff isochore (Vertucci and Roos 1993; Vertucci et al. 1995; Eira et al. 1999b): d(ln(aw))/d(1/T)=\u0394Hsorp(T)/R, where \u0394Hsorp(T) is the enthalpy of sorption and R is the ideal gas constant. Assuming a constant \u0394Hsorp with temperature (Vertucci and Roos 1993), in C. arabica seeds at 0.2 g H2O g\u22121 dry weight (the unfreezable water content), \u0394Hsorp should not be lower than \u22120.5 kJ mol\u22121 of water in order to avoid a decrease of seed water activity at \u2212196\u00b0C below the critical water activity for desiccation tolerance, i.e., about 0.45, as quantified at room temperature (Dussert et al. 1999). The value of \u0394Hsorp measured between 5 and 25\u00b0C at 0.2 g H2O g\u22121 dry weight in C. arabica seeds by Eira et al. (1999b) was lower than \u22120.5 kJ mol\u22121 of water, indicating clearly that desiccation damage could occur at LN temperature in C. arabica seeds if assuming the existence of a single water activity for desiccation sensitivity and a constant value of \u0394Hsorp with temperature. Therefore, the prediction of the existence of an hydration window for LN exposure in non\u2010orthodox oily seeds should not be done by the comparison of the unfreezable water content with the critical water content for desiccation sensitivity as measured at room temperature, but by comparing the critical water activity for desiccation damage, measured at room temperature, to the calculated water activity at LN temperature of seeds desiccated to the unfreezable water content.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the nature of this relationship. Additional data, previously reported by other authors, fit remarkably well with the relationship shown on Fig. 7: the unfreezable water contents of seeds of Quercus\nrubra, Q.\nrobur and Azadirachta indica were of 0.32, 0.21 and 0.14 g H2O g\u22121 dry weight, respectively, whereas their lipid contents are 3, 20 and 43% dry weight, respectively (Pritchard and Manger 1998; Sun 1999; Sacand\u00e9 et al. 2000). The relationship between the lipid content and WCu appeared not to follow a linear model, even when WCu was expressed on a non\u2010lipid dry weight basis. Since this relationship was not linear, it is a good indication that either the interaction between non\u2010lipid components and water varies among species or that lipids interfere with the freezing properties of water. The interspecific variability observed in coffee seeds for the water activity corresponding to the unfreezable water content ranged between 0.75 and 0.88 (water potentials of between \u221238 and \u221219 MPa), and was found to be independent of the seed lipid content. These values of awu are remarkably consistent with those observed in orthodox seeds of pea and soybean (Vertucci 1990). However, the interspecific variance for the water activity corresponding to unfreezable water content is certainly associated with the non\u2010linear relationship observed between the lipid content and the unfreezable water content of seeds: in other words, components other than lipids influence the value of awu.",
