            "text": "Previous studies have clearly shown a great phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of memory T cells in both mice and humans (reviewed in 1\u20138). A series of surface markers including CD45RO, CD45RA, CD28, CD27, CCR7, CD7 and CD57 have been used in order to define different populations of memory T cells and to correlate these markers with functional capacity and differentiation stage. These studies have led to the generation of different models of differentiation of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. For instance, the marker combinations CD28+CD27+, CD28\u2013CD27+ and CD28\u2013CD27\u2013 may represent memory CD8 T cells at an early stage, intermediate stage and advanced stage of differentiation, respectively 9\u201311. The lack of expression of CD7 is characteristic of memory T cells at an advanced stage of differentiation 12\u201315. The expression of CD57 defines CD8 T cells at a terminal stage of differentiation 16\u201319. The combined use of CCR7 with CD45RA led to the identification of two phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets of memory T cells 20. The lack of expression of CCR7 (CCR7\u2013) defines a population of effector memory T cells (TEM) that resides predominantly in the periphery, while the expression of CCR7 (CCR7+) characterizes a population of central memory T cells (TCM) that resides predominantly within the secondary lymphoid organs and serves as precursors of effector cells 20. This latter study led to the identification of four and three subsets of CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively 20.",

These studies have been performed predominantly with CD8 T cells, and the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in the different viral infections was proposed to result from skewed maturation or replication senescence of memory CD8 T cells during HIV\u20101 infection 21, 24 or an influence of the type of pathogen/virus on the specific development of distinct memory T cell populations 21.",

Recent studies investigating the function of virus\u2010specific CD4 T cells demonstrated a skewed representation of different populations of antigen (Ag)\u2010specific CD4 T cells with a selective reduction in the proportion of helper (IL\u20102\u2010secreting and proliferating) CD4 T cells in HIV\u20101 compared to CMV infection 27, 29. In this regard, we recently provided evidence that the functional heterogeneity of Ag\u2010specific CD4 T cells responses is influenced by Ag persistence/exposure and load (Harari et al., submitted). In the present study, we have investigated the factors that may be responsible for the phenotypic heterogeneity of Ag\u2010specific CD4 T cell responses in humans by analyzing different models differing in Ag persistence/exposure and load. In particular, we have used a) tetanus toxoid (TT) as a model of memory T cell response where the Ag is cleared; b) the CMV, EBV, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) chronic infections as well as controlled HIV\u20101 infection in long\u2010term nonprogressors (LTNP) as a model of repetitive Ag exposure and low Ag load; and c) chronic HIV\u20101 infection and acute CMV infection as a model of Ag persistence and high Ag load. Our results demonstrate the existence of a third population of memory CD4 T cells (CD45RA+CCR7\u2013) with characteristics of terminally differentiated cells (i.e. short telomeres and a lack of proliferative capacity). In addition, we show that the phenotypic heterogeneity and maturation stage of memory CD4 T cells among the different models of immune responses can be explained by the Ag persistence and load and that Ag\u2010specific CD4 T cells with the CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 phenotype are only generated in conditions of repetitive Ag exposure and low Ag load.",

Using this approach two and three populations of memory CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes have been identified, respectively 20. The population with the CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 phenotype that defines the terminally differentiated memory CD8 T cell population (TET) has not been described for CD4 T cells 20, 24, 26. We therefore investigated the composition of the pool of memory CD4 T cells. Blood mononuclear cells were stained with antibodies to CD4, CCR7 and CD45RA. According to previous studies 20, the majority of blood CD4 T cells are CD45RA+CCR7+, i.e. naive cells, CD45RA\u2013CCR7+ or CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 (Fig. 1). However, a small but well\u2010defined fourth cell population with the CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 phenotype was also consistently found among CD4 T cells (Fig. 1). The mean percentage of CD4+CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 cells was 2.3\u00b11.1 in a large group (n=43) of randomly selected blood donors (Fig. 1). Therefore, these results demonstrate the existence of a third population of memory CD4 T cells with the CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 phenotype. Among CD8 T cells, this phenotypically distinct cell population has been proposed to define a population with functional characteristics, e.g. poor proliferative capacity, of terminally differentiated cells 20, 24, 26.",

According to previous studies 20, substantial differences in telomere length were observed among the different populations of CD4 T cells defined by the expression of CD45RA and CCR7. The overlaid histogram plots of telomere PNA fluorescence for each of the sorted populations indicates that CD45RA+CCR7+ CD4 T cells, i.e. naive cells, have longer telomeres compared to the CD45RA\u2013CCR7+ (TCM) and CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 (TEM) memory CD4 T cell populations (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with the higher number of cell divisions occurring in memory versus naive cells and with the previous observations of Sallusto et al. 20. Of interest, the newly identified CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 CD4 T cell population had a telomere length consistently (in three separate experiments) shorter than the other two populations of memory CD4 T cells (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 CD4 T cells are at an advanced stage of differentiation that is at least comparable to that of CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 (TEM) CD4 T cells.",

The different memory T cell populations were isolated by cell sorting, and homeostatic proliferation was assessed on the basis of their ability to proliferate in the presence of a cocktail of cytokines (IL\u20106, IL\u20107, IL\u201010, IL\u201015 and TNF\u2010\u03b1) 30.

The CD45RA\u2013CCR7+ phenotype is typical of TCM cells and of cells secreting IL\u20102. Furthermore, it has been proposed that TCM cells represent long\u2010lived memory T cells 20. In support of this hypothesis, it was recently observed that hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2010specific CD4 T cells identified by MHC class II tetramers were indeed CD45RA\u2013CCR7+ in subjects who spontaneously resolved HCV viremia 31. Similarly, influenza (Flu)\u2010specific or Flu vaccine\u2010specific CD4 T cells were also CD45RA\u2013CCR7+/\u2013\n32. Therefore, the CD45RA\u2013CCR7+ phenotype truly defines long\u2010lived memory CD4 T cells and should be found in a situation of Ag clearance as is the case with the TT\u2010specific CD4 T cell response. Our results indeed indicate that TT\u2010specific CD4 T cells are mostly IL\u20102\u2010secreting cells and CD45RA\u2013CCR7+. TT is not a viral Ag. However, we wish to propose that similar memory CD4 T cell responses are also typical of virus infections such as influenza, respiratory syncithia virus, coronavirus, leukochoriomeningitis virus, etc., in which viruses are efficiently cleared after the acute phase of infection and, unlike CMV, do not have a latency reactivation pattern.",

These functionally distinct CD4 T cell populations were contained within three phenotypic populations: CD45RA\u2013CCR7+, CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 and CD45RA+CCR7\u2013. The IL\u20102\u2010secreting cells were either CD45RA\u2013CCR7+ or CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013, while IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010secreting cells were CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 or CD45RA+CCR7\u2013. Finally, the CD4 T cell response in the model of Ag persistence and high Ag load, i.e. chronic and progressive HIV\u20101 infection as well as acute CMV infection, was dominated by the presence of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010secreting cells with the CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 phenotype. Therefore, the three models of memory CD4 T cell responses are associated with either a mono\u2010phenotypic response (CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 for Ag clearance and CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 for Ag persistence and high Ag load) or a multi\u2010phenotypic response (CD45RA\u2013CCR7+, CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 and CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 for repetitive Ag exposure and/or low Ag load).",

            "text": "The above results raise a series of issues. Firstly, how can it be explained that IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010secreting cells with the CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 phenotype are found in memory CD4 T cell responses associated with protracted Ag exposure and/or low Ag load but not under conditions of Ag persistence and high load despite the fact that the memory CD4 T cells are exclusively composed of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010secreting cells? On the basis of both the present data and previous studies on memory CD8 T cells, chronic stimulation with low Ag levels seems to be necessary for the appearance of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells with the CD45RA+CCR7\u2013 phenotype. Secondly, it is important to underscore that substantial phenotypic and functional changes were observed within the CMV\u2010 and HIV\u20101\u2010specific CD4 T cell responses under different conditions of Ag load. The mono\u2010phenotypic CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 CD4 T cell response typical of conditions of Ag persistence and high Ag load (chronic and progressive HIV\u20101 infection) was not found in LTNP, where we found the multi\u2010phenotypic CD4 T cell response typical of repetitive Ag exposure and low Ag load. Along the same line, a mono\u2010phenotypic CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 CD4 T cell response characterized the CMV\u2010specific CD4 T cell response during primary infection, whereas a multi\u2010phenotypic response was associated with the CMV\u2010specific CD4 T cell response during chronic CMV infection. An important variable between progressive and nonprogressive HIV\u20101 infection and between primary and chronic CMV infection is Ag load. Therefore, taken together our data indicate that the phenotypic as well as the functional heterogeneity of memory CD4 T cell responses is regulated by Ag persistence and Ag load. Thirdly, the phenotypic patterns shown for CD4 T cell responses within the different models of Ag persistence and load were consistent with those shown for CD8 T cells using CD45RA and CCR7 24, 26. In fact, multi\u2010phenotypic CD8 T cell responses were only found under conditions of protracted Ag exposure and Ag load, e.g. chronic CMV and EBV infections 24, 26. The mono\u2010phenotypic CD45RA\u2013CCR7\u2013 pattern appeared under conditions of Ag persistence or high Ag load, e.g. chronic HIV\u20101 infection and acute CMV infection, and the mono\u2010phenotypic CD45RA\u2013CCR7+ (dull) pattern was found under conditions of Ag clearance, e.g. influenza infection and LCMV infection in mice 32, 33. Therefore, memory CD4 and CD8 T cell responses have common phenotypic patterns modulated by Ag persistence and Ag load. Fourthly, these different phenotypic patterns seem to reflect different stages of differentiation of memory CD4 T cells. Recent studies using CD27 and CD28 support this hypothesis 34. However, additional studies will be needed to directly address the relationship between phenotype and differentiation stage. The results presented here support the hypothesis that the levels of Ag represent the critical factor influencing this heterogeneity.",
