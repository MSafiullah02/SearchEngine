However, it is sometimes difficult to identify IN/IBs, particularly in autolyzed tissues or samples from both early and late stages of infection, and other methods were presently developed. Methods: Stray dog samples were evaluated by histopathology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to investigate the status of the CAV-2 infection on the stray dogs in Korea. Histologic tests were performed, and dogs with pneumonic lungs were further evaluated by IHC and PCR. Results: Pathognomonic IN/IBs were identified in 3 of 213 lungs; CAV-2 PCR was positive for 27 of 213 pneumonic lungs. A total of 7 of 27 CAV-2 PCR-positive lungs were IHC-positive. No PCR-negative lung was IHC-positive. Positive results were primarily detected in the IN/IBs of the bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, and very rarely in the cytoplasm of bronchial epithelial cells. Conclusions: IHC was a more reliable diagnostic method than conventional pathologic methods in the present study, and suggests that IHC should be routinely used in the diagnosis of CAV-2 infection. Further, PCR alone may not be adequate for CAV-2 diagnosis.",

            "text": "Infectious canine respiratory diseases primarily occur in dogs housed in groups, including those in rescue shelters, breeding kennels, and veterinary hospitals. Several studies evaluating natural disease outbreaks have demonstrated complex etiologies and infection with various viruses and bacteria. Common infectious causes of respiratory disease in dogs include canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2). 1 A canine coronavirus associated with clinical canine respiratory disease similar to bovine coronavirus has been recently described in the UK. 2 However, CAV-2 is more commonly associated with infectious laryngotracheitis, or the kennel cough complex. The CAV-2 virus is included in the genus Mastadenovirus and the family Adenoviridae. Adenoviridae are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses with 26-to 44-kb double-stranded DNA genomes, 3 and infect a variety of vertebrates including mammals, fish, birds, and reptiles. 3 Pulmonary CAV-2 lesions are consistent with those of bronchointerstitial pneumonia, including the presence of necrosis and large basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (IN/IBs) in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells as well as pulmonary macrophages. 4 Simultaneous CAV-2 and CDV infections have been previously described. 5 Histopathology is a reliable indicator of CAV-2 infection because large IN/IBs are easily visualized in the infected lung. However, it is frequently difficult to find IN/IBs in lung tissue, (particularly in autolyzed tissue), at the early and late stages of infection, and in cases co-infected with suppurative bacteria.",

Viruses commonly associated with respiratory disease in domestic dogs include CDV, CAV-2, canine parainfluenza virus type 2 (CPIV-2), canine reovirus type 1 (CRV-1), and canine herpesvirus type 1 (CHV-1). 5 CAV-2 was first detected from dogs affected by laryngotracheitis in Canada in 1961. 9 The clinical isolate was designated Toronto A26/61, was characterized as an adenovirus, and was initially categorized as an attenuated canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1) strain. 1 CAV-2 is considered one of the most common causes of infectious tracheobroncheitis, and results in mild respiratory tract infection. CAV-2 has been implicated in enteritis episodes and has been detected in the brains of dogs with neurological signs. 1 Serological tests for canine viral disease using immunofluorescent methods were performed in Korea in 1995, 10 and 42.5% of dogs from veterinary clinics had anti-CAV-2 antibodies. Anti-CDV and anti-CPIV-2 antibodies were identified at 83.8% and 63.8%, respectively. CAV-2 was less prevalent than CDV and CPIV-2; however, CAV-2 was identified in the present study as one of the important infectious agents of dogs in Korea.

            "text": "Most cases of CAV-2 infection are histologically characterized by necrotizing tracheobronchitis and bronchiolitis with eosinophilic IN/IBs in epithelial cells. 6 CAV-2 infection clinically causes severe necrotizing bronchitis and interstitial pneumonia, particularly in the presence of secondary bacterial infections. 6 Nuclei with IN/IBs are usually round and very large, and inclusions are usually present in alveolar macrophages, pneumocytes, and bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells. The size and shape of identified viral particles were similar to those seen in previous studies, and the pattern was also identical with previous reports. 11, 12 Intracellular CAV-2 antigens were identified in the bronchiolar epithelia, macrophages, neutrophils, and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. 13 However, CAV-2 antigens were also detected in a tonsillar epithelial cells in a previous report. 14 Positive signals were primarily detected in the nuclei by immunohistochemical staining in the present study. However, mild positive signals were detected in the cytoplasms of infected macrophages and epithelial cells, suggesting that virus was present in both the cytoplasms and the nuclei, similar to previous reports in cell culture systems. 15 IN/IBs are generally located in the nucleus; however, spherical dark inclusions were observed in both the cytoplasms and the nuclei in MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) cells infected with CAV-2. 15 The distribution of these cellular inclusions suggested that they were simultaneously formed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus and did not appear to be secondary to movement of these inclusions between the cellular compartments in the early stages of infection. 15 IHC was reported as a reliable and rapid method for the diagnosis of CAV-1 infection, as previously reported. 16 CAV-1 and CAV-2 can be differentiated by haemagglutination and neutralization test in the laboratory. They are difficult to differentiate in practical field specimens, particularly with infection in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, simple PCR methods were developed to detect and differentiate the viruses using a single pair of common primers based on E3 and flanking region sequences. 8 These primers were designed to detect PCR products for CAV-1 (508 bp) and CAV-2 (1,030 bp), respectively, under the same amplification conditions; 8 these primers were used in the present study. There were no CAV-1 cases, but 27 of 213 cases were CAV-2 positive. The PCR method used in the present study was effective and could be used for rapid diagnosis and differentiation of the different adenoviruses in canine field samples.",

The detection ratio for CAV-2 infection in the present study was higher in IHC than in routine histopathology ( Table 2 ).
