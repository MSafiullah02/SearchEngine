While around 80% of cases will result in mild forms of the disease, a study of admissions in 166 UK hospitals showed that around 33% of all patients requiring hospitalization and 45% of those requiring high dependency or intensive care have died from the disease 2 . There is a significant correlation with age, sex and underlying co-morbidities, with elderly males at highest mortality risk. There has been some success in repurposing existing antiviral therapies such as the investigational agent Remdesivir in COVID-19 patients 3 , but antiviral agents tend to be more effective when applied early in the disease course. It would be highly desirable to understand the differential in host response between patients in terms of their underlying genetic, epidemiological and clinical factors to be able to predict which individuals are more at risk of developing severe COVID-19, and to identify potential therapies for the later stages of the disease, which are driven by the host's immune response rather than the coronavirus 4 .",

It finds and statistically validates combinations of features (typically three to ten features in combination known as 'signatures') that together are strongly associated with a specific disease diagnosis or other clinical phenotype (e.g. fast disease progression or therapy response). It can combine genomic, transcriptomic and epidemiological data in its analyses. When used to analyze genomic data from patients, precisionlife can identify high-order epistatic interactions comprising multiple consistently co-associated SNP genotypes. This analytical mining platform has been validated in multiple disease populations 16, 17 .",
