First, our results are only applicable to adults, and the rates of mixed bacterial-viral infections may be quite different in children. In addition, our results may not be applicable to all adults admitted with respiratory tract infections, since most illnesses in our study were not severe, as reflected by the low mortality rate. The inability to obtain consent from some of the most critically ill patients may have underestimated the rate of mixed viral-bacterial infections. Also, despite vigorous attempts to collect adequate respiratory samples in a timely fashion, we were successful in only 51% of hospitalizations, also leading to underestimates of bacterial infection. Conversely, it is also possible that bacterial infection based on results of sputum cultures overestimates the incidence of infection, as it is often not possible to distinguish chronic colonization from infection even with adequate samples. Last, the presence of viral RNA may not always be causally associated with the illness leading to hospitalization. Prolonged viral detection following respiratory tract infection due to rhinovirus and other viruses can been seen, particularly when using sensitive molecular diagnostic tests.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, bacterial coinfection is associated with approximately 40% of serious respiratory viral infections in adults requiring hospitalization. Patients with positive results of viral tests should be carefully evaluated for concomitant bacterial infection, and it is prudent to initiate early empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with severe viral illness or definitive radiographic pneumonia. At the present time, establishing a specific bacterial diagnosis on the basis of traditional methods remains difficult, and better bacterial diagnostic tests are needed. Future studies are needed to develop treatment algorithms that use combinations of biomarkers and clinical parameters to accurately predict patients at low risk for bacterial infection in whom antibiotics may be safely discontinued.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Respiratory syncytial virus infection in elderly and high-risk adults", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Falsey", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Hennessey", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Formica", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Cox", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Walsh", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "352", "issn": "", "pages": "1749--59", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Improved diagnosis of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia with real-time polymerase chain reaction", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Templeton", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Scheltinga", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Van Den Eeden", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Graffelman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Van Den Broek", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Claas", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Clin Infect Dis", "volume": "41", "issn": "", "pages": "345--51", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Rates of hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza virus in older adults", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Widmer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Zhu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["V"], "last": "Williams", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Griffin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Edwards", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Talbot", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "J Infect Dis", "volume": "206", "issn": "", "pages": "56--62", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Comparison of two multiplex methods for detection of respiratory viruses: FilmArray RP and xTAG RVP", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Rand", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Rampersaud", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Houck", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2011, "venue": "J Clin Microbiol", "volume": "49", "issn": "", "pages": "2449--53", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "The use of antimicrobial agents after diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections in hospitalized adults: antibiotics or anxiolytics?", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Shiley", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Lautenbach", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2010, "venue": "Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol", "volume": "31", "issn": "", "pages": "1177--83", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Impact of rapid diagnosis on management of adults hospitalized with influenza", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Falsey", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Murata", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Walsh", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "Arch Intern Med", "volume": "95", "issn": "", "pages": "1029--1066", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Studies on influenza in the pandemic of 1957-1958.
