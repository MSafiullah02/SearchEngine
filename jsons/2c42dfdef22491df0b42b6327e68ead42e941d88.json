Essential feature of respiratory viruses is their easiness of transmission, especially in places with great density of people (schools, governments, mall centers, and means of public transport) (Brydak 2007) . Elder people, children up to 24 months and persons from high risk groups are particularly exposed to respiratory viruses' infections. The most frequently circulating respiratory viruses are: influenza virus type A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV-A) and B (RSV-B), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (PIV-1,-2,-3), human coronavirus (hCoV), adenovirus (ADV), human rhinovirus (hRV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Infections caused by respiratory viruses can have different clinical symptoms, while specific set of symptoms can be induced by different viruses. Despite usually mild course of disease, some viruses causing certain disease entity can result in serious complications. Furthermore, not only viruses can cause particular illness, but also bacteria. Therefore, quick and appropriate diagnostic is crucial for administering proper treatment (Stefa\u0144ska et al. 2013) . What is more, organism attacked by one pathogen has reduced immunity and becomes vulnerable to the subsequent ones. In this way numerous co-infections occur, which can result in death (Brydak 2008 (Brydak , 2011 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 354, "end": 367, "text": "(Brydak 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1247, "text": "(Stefa\u0144ska et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1446, "text": "(Brydak 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1447, "end": 1461, "text": "(Brydak , 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Because RNA virus samples were typed in Voivodeship Sanitary Epidemiological Stations, only subtyping of influenza viruses was achieved.

In order to get detailed virological analysis, laboratory data were categorized into 7 age groups: 0 -4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-25, 26-54, 45-64 , and >65 years old. Influenza viruses made up 42.6 %, while influenza-like viruses 57.4 % of all positively confirmed cases.
