            "text": "In the study mentioned in the previous section, \u201cThreats,\u201d Hall commented on fire protection features in high-rise buildings by stating that,In several instances, the value of these fire protection features [i.e., automatic extinguishing systems (primarily sprinklers), fire detection equipment, and fire-resistive construction] may be seen clearly in a statistical analysis of 1994-1998 loss per fire averages, with and without the protection. For high-rise buildings, automatic extinguishing systems are associated with a reduction of at least 88% in the rate of deaths per 1,000 fires for each of the three property classes (excluding office buildings, which had no deaths recorded in NFIRS [National Fire Incident Reporting System] in high-rise buildings) and at least 44% in the average dollar loss per fire for each of the four property classes. Fire detection equipment is associated with a reduction of 55% in the rate of deaths per 1,000 fires in apartment buildings. Fire-resistive construction is associated with a reduction of 30% in average dollar loss per fire in apartment buildings. This probably is produced not directly by the construction but indirectly by the compartmentation features that tend to be used with fire-resistive construction, features that keep more fires smaller and so keep property losses lower. (Note, though, that compartmentation practices probably vary more by type of occupancy than by type of construction.) Because high-rise buildings often use all three systems, it is very difficult to try to separate their effects on loss rates, and many rates are very sensitive to deaths or large dollar loss in individual incidents.Automatic extinguishing systems and fire detection equipment and the compartmentation features associated with fire-resistive construction all contribute to fire protection by helping to keep fires small, with extinguishing and construction doing so directly and detection doing so by providing early warning that can lead to earlier manual suppression\u2026.Finally, the effectiveness of these fire protection systems and features and their widespread use in high-rise buildings mean that when people are killed in high-rise residential fires, they are much more likely to have been close to the fire, where it is more likely that fatal injury could occur before [the] fire could be stopped or blocked by these systems and features.16\n",
