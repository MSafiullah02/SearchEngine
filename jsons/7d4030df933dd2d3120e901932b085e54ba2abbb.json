As of February 23, 2020, China had 77,150 confirmed new coronavirus infections, of which, 64,287 cases were reported in Hubei Province [2] . As of February 23, 2020, there were 2,592 deaths in China due to COVID-19 infection [2] . Also, as of February 23, 2020, more than 3,000 medical staff were infected with the COVID-19 virus [2] .",

These factors are of concern, particularly when infected individuals travel long distances. The growing number of people infected with COVID-19 increased awareness of mortality associated with infection, and the novel nature of the viral infection has resulted in anxiety in the population of Hubei Province and throughout China. During January and February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has begun to be controlled by the efforts and skill of medical staff throughout China. However, the psychological and emotional stress and the quality of life for people in both endemic and non-endemic areas in China have been significantly changed since the beginning of the COVID-19 virus epidemic [3] .",

In 2015, Omar et al. showed that misconceptions or incorrect perceptions about the modes of disease transmission were associated with mental distress and other negative psychological responses that included anxiety and panic, which indicated that public awareness was an important factor in controlling both the infectious disease and the effects of stress associated with the disease [6] . Perceived disease susceptibility and perceived disease severity may be associated with increased levels of mental distress and the adoption of preventive measures, including self-isolation [7] .",

In 2017, Huang et al. identified the major sleep disturbances that may result in severe health consequences, including depression and anxiety [9] . During January and February 2020 in Hubei Province in China, the medical staff have suffered the greatest pressure in the population due to long working hours, an increase in workload, and the challenge of treating patients with a novel viral infection, COVID-19, that cannot be prevented with a vaccine, cannot be treated and has an unknown pathogenesis [10, 11] . Therefore, in addition to treating patients who are infected with COVID-19, non-infected members of the population also have a psychological stress response to COVID-19, which may have long-term health consequences. Public health data from previous similar epidemics can help to prevent or control events, such as epidemics, which can improve the health of a city, a country, or the population of the world [12] . Therefore, it is important to understand, monitor, and evaluate stress and psychological problems during epidemics, such as COVID-19 [13] .",

However, for some people, somatic or physical changes became worse during the two-week period, which may have been due to three main factors. First, the publication of several online media reports significantly prolonged the time people spent browsing their mobile phones, which may have affected their normal sleep schedule. The lack of evidence-based scientific and medical knowledge of the population can be difficult to distinguish from speculation and rumor that may cause fear and anxiety in large populations [24] . Secondly, the amount of activity and workload for some occupations reduced due to quarantine and self-isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in a lack of normal social activities, which would have resulted in feelings of stress and isolation [25 -27] . Third, when previously employed people are required to stay at home for a long time, their income decreases, which results in anxiety [28, 29] .",

The symptoms of inability to fall asleep within 30 minutes and difficulty in staying awake during the day may have been due to three main factors, Firstly, in 2017, Akcali et al. [30] showed that anxiety was a common cause of insomnia, and it may be assumed that the stress response to COVID-19 might lead to physical dysfunction which can include sleep dysfunction [31] . Secondly, during the outbreak of COVID-19, the government strongly recommended all the citizens to stay at home as much as possible, but the government did not include a recommendation to maintain daily physical activities while staying home. Physical activity is an important factor in maintaining psychological wellbeing, including the normal sleep cycle [27] . Thirdly, especially for the 18 -24 year age group, who may have been working or studying at home during the two-week study period, their sleeping habits would have changed without the need to wake up early in the morning, which may have resulted in poor sleep quality and duration from staying up late and sleeping late into the morning.",

For the study participants in the non-endemic districts in China, there were no significant differences regarding these beliefs. Most study participants were confident that they were likely to recover once infected. During the epidemic of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, the government's response has included the building of two new hospitals in Wuhan, providing information to the population, and increasing the provision of medical care. The role of the media has changed, and now broadcasts the number of people who recover from COVID-19 infection each day, all of which may re-assure the population, reduce levels of anxiety, and increase their confidence. Importantly, evidence-based scientific and medical information has been provided to the population of Hubei Province and throughout China to provide awareness of COVID-19, which may reduce some of the fear caused by a lack of knowledge of this new infectious disease [33] . improve. Despite public awareness, levels of anxiety exist that affect the quality of life during epidemics, including periods of population quarantine or self-isolation.
