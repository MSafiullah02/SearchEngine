From 1982 to 1987, 16 oceanographic cruises were carried out along the Pacific coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico. Larvae of 42 mesopelagic fish taxa were collected. Larval abundance was highly variable during the studied period, but summer months coincided with higher abundance (>200 larvae under 10 m 2 ). Larval assemblages were dominated by three of the most common species of tropical (Vinciguerria lucetia, Diogenichthys laternatus) and subtropical affinity (Triphoturus mexicanus). A group of species of tropical affinity (Diplophos proximus, Diaphus pacificus, Benthosema panamense) was useful for distinguishing the 1982-84 El Ni\u00f1 o event, and an assemblage of larvae of temperate affinity (Symbolophorus californiensis, Melamphaes lugubris, Bathylagus ochotensis, Leuroglossus stilbius, Protomyctophum crockeri) characterized 'normal' years (mid-1984 to mid-1987).",

Adults of some species migrate vertically to surface waters at night (Paxton, 1967; Watanabe and Kawaguchi, 2003) , and some lanternfish species (e.g. Benthosema panamense) form compact aggregations at the surface during daylight (Moser and Ahlstrom, 1970) . Diurnal migrations are thought to play an important role in the vertical transport of biomass (biological convection). Mesopelagic fish contribute a considerable portion of the diets of commercially important fish, cephalopods, and marine mammals (Alverson, 1961; Gaskett et al., 2001) . Their abundance and ecological role in the marine food chain are recognized in studies of marine ecology, but also in fisheries sciences, as a potential fishing resource (Kawaguchi and Shimizu, 1978) .",

For example, seven mesopelagic species ranked in the 13 principal taxa identified by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) surveys from 1951 to 1984 . Early life history descriptions and spatial and seasonal distributions of early life stages are summarized in the literature (e.g. Moser et al., , 1994 Moser, 1996) . Mesopelagic species are the principal constituents of larval fish assemblages that inhabit offshore waters of the southerly California Current (Loeb et al., 1983a; Funes-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2002) . This region is characterized by marked seasonal shifts in cooling and heating. The main source of seasonal variation is related to the coastal circulation pattern, with the south-flowing California Current as the dominant flow during spring and summer, the poleward-flowing inshore countercurrent dominant during fall and winter, and the California undercurrent with subsurface poleward flow present throughout the year (Hickey, 1979; Lynn and Simpson, 1987) .",

El Ni\u00f1o events in 1982-83 and 1987-88 are detected along the Baja California coast as positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies (G\u00f3mez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 1995; Hern\u00e1ndez-Trujillo, 1999) . Environmental changes associated with El Ni\u00f1 o events may have a large impact on ecosystems, including expansion in the range of some adult fish populations and consequent expansion of their spawning area (Bailey and Incze, 1985; Moser et al., 1987; MacCall and Prager, 1988) . During El Ni\u00f1 o 1958-59, the distribution of fish larvae of tropical affinity expanded northward beyond their typical range in the California Current (Moser et al., 1987) . During El Ni\u00f1o 1982-83 invertebrate zooplankton and micronekton and fish larvae off Baja California Sur were predominantly of tropical and subtropical affinity, while temperate species, although infrequent in the region, had more restricted geographical distributions during El Ni\u00f1 o (Funes-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 1995 G\u00f3mez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 1995; Hern\u00e1ndez-Trujillo, 1999) .",

Survey lines were perpendicular to the coast, extending seaward 37-185 km (20-100 nautical miles, n miles), and stations were placed at 37-km intervals (20 n miles) on the survey lines ( Fig. 1 ). In total 614 plankton net tows were made. Plankton samples were collected with a bongo net (333-and 505-lm mesh) with a 0.5-m mouth diameter that were towed obliquely between the surface and approximately 200 m maximum depth in open water, and to near-bottom depth in shallower water (Smith and Richardson, 1977) . A flow meter in the mouth of each net was used to calculate the volume of water strained. Plankton samples were preserved with 4% formalin buffered with sodium borate. Plankton biomass (mL per 1000 m 3 ) was determined using the displaced volume technique (Beers, 1976) . Fish larvae and eggs were sorted from the 505-lm mesh samples. Mesopelagic fish larvae were identified from chapters in Moser (1996) as principal sources. Counts of fish larvae were converted to number under 10 m 2 sea surface (Smith and Richardson, 1977) .",

After classification of species and stations for a particular data set, the original percentage occurrence of each species (positive tows) was rearranged according to the order in which sampling periods and species appeared in the dendrograms. Measurements of similarity and classification were analyzed with the community analysis package 2.13 (Herderson and Seaby, 2002) . Spearman's q rank-order correlation analysis was used to explore the relationships between abundance of mesopelagic larvae with SST, plankton biomass, upwelling strength, and MEI.

Group 1 consisted mainly of months with 'normal' or slightly negative SST anomalies from mid-1984 to 1986, and October 1987 which had a moderately large positive anomaly, while group 2 occurred mainly during the months associated with positive SST anomalies, the 1982 to mid-1984 El Ni\u00f1 o months. Three groups of taxa (A, B, and C) were separated in the species dendrogram by more than 8.5% similarity (Fig. 4) . Species group A principally contained taxa that were relatively uncommon in the area and have transitional affinity (Melamphaes lugubris, Bathylagus ochotensis, Leuroglossus stilbius and Protomyctophum crockeri). These species were present principally in the 'normal period' (group 1). Species group B principally contained tropical and subtropical species, present in both month groups. Species group B was dominated by the three commonest species: V. lucetia, T. mexicanus, and D. laternatus. All three occurred in both month groups, but T. mexicanus and D. laternatus were more common during 'normal' months (group 1), and V. lucetia was slightly more common during El Ni\u00f1 o months (group 2). Species in group C were exclusively of tropical affinity that occurred mainly during El Ni\u00f1 o months in group 2 (Diplophos proximus, Diaphus pacifi-cus, and Benthosema panamense). Their non-group 2 occurrence was by Diaphus pacificus in 1987, an El Ni\u00f1 o month in group 1 (Fig. 4) .",

S \u00bc subarctic; T \u00bc transitional; SbTr \u00bc subtropical; Tr \u00bc tropical; WWC \u00bc warm water cosmopolite; ETP \u00bc eastern tropical Pacific; Ext \u00bc extended spawning season. Faunal association and spawning season information principally from Moser (1996) . mesopelagic taxa were the tropical V. lucetia and D. laternatus and subtropical T. mexicanus, whether the regime was warm or not. These species occurred mainly in the southern region of the California Current, and their larvae ranked third, eleventh, and sixth, respectively, among ichthyoplankton taxa identified from CalCOFI survey cruises from 1951 to 1984 . They occurred throughout the year; abundance of V. lucetia and T. mexicanus larvae peaked in summer and D. laternatus larvae peaked during late winter and again in summer . The current data set did not support the view that mesopelagic fish larvae had a marked seasonal trend in abundance and occurrence during the studied period. However, tropical species such as V. lucetia, and H. atratum peaked mostly during periods with a positive SST anomaly, principally during 1982-83, but D. laternatus appears to be more frequent when SST anomalies were smaller and varied between positive and negative, while the highest abundances and occurrences of T. mexicanus were principally during 'normal years ' (1985-86) . Historical data showed that T. mexicanus ranked second in abundance off central Baja California during the cool year 1975, followed by D. laternatus and V. lucetia (Loeb et al., 1983a) , similar to the findings registered during 'normal years' . Mesopelagic fish larvae off Baja California Sur fall into several major ecological assemblages, including subarctic-transitional, transitional, central north Pacific, and eastern tropical Pacific, in agreement with Moser et al. (1987) . The conjunction of diverse ecological assemblages is particularly pronounced at the southern extreme of the California Current where cold and warm water collide, creating rich 'meadows' (Malakoff, 2004) . Our data on taxonomic composition confirms this. Subtropical and tropical species were the primary constituents (75%) of mesopelagic fish larvae off Baja California. Consequently, larval fish assemblages reflect the transitional nature of this part of the California Current region and its zoogeographic components (Moser et al., 1987) . This is similar to hydrographic structures in the Kuroshio Current region and myctophid larvae assemblages related to it (Sassa et al., 2004) . Other studies of plankton populations off Baja California Sur showed that the number of tropical species was relatively constant (G\u00f3mez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 1995; Hern\u00e1ndez-Trujillo, 1999) . Nevertheless, there is high inter-annual variation in species composition that could be related to changes in the California Current system and environmental shifts like El Ni\u00f1 o. Such a shift between years was reported during the 1957-58 El Ni\u00f1 o (Moser et al., 1987) .",

Subarctic-transitional species tended to occur although scarce in late winter and spring when the California Current is strongest, but these species were relatively uncommon or restricted to the north during spring 1983.

Both groups (1 and 2) contained three of the most common species of tropical and subtropical affinity: V. lucetia, D. laternatus, and T. mexicanus (species group B). However, frequencies of occurrence of tropical affinity species (species group C) during El Ni\u00f1 o conditions were useful to distinguish them from 'normal' months, when subarctictransitional taxa occurred relatively more frequently (species group A). Triphoturus mexicanus that is characteristic of the southern half of the California Current region may be less affected by changes in the flow regime off Baja California Sur, compared with species at or near their range limits which are probably at their southernmost occurrence in the California Current region. Triphoturus mexicanus was primarily associated with tropical, subtropical, and warm water cosmopolitan species (species group B), but occurs principally during 'normal' months, possibly related to the transitional nature of the Triphoturus group strongly connected with two larger recurrent groups of the southern complex (Vinciguerria and Symbolophorus; Moser et al., 1987) .",
