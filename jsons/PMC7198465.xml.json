Almost all plans mentioned ethics, with many referring to other guidelines like those produced by the University of Toronto, New York, or Minnesota.9-11 The tragic dilemmas and intense moral distress, exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, have produced further ethics guidance.12,13 Among the state plans that explicitly developed ethical grounding, Minnesota and Arizona were exemplary. In 2006, Minnesota commissioned a detailed study of relevant ethical issues. This was published in 2010 and included the results of public engagement exercises on ethics held around Minnesota, their detailed ethical reasoning, and a list of recommendations for ethical decision-making when rationing different types of interventions (eg, antiviral medications, masks, ventilators, etc.). This detailed and thorough report was used by several other state plans.11 The Minnesota Pandemic Ethics Project continues to produce new resources.11 Arizona\u2019s 2015 plan had ethics as foundational to the whole report, with the additional goal of ensuring that pandemic responses are compassionate.14 Their working group also developed a Crisis Standards of Care Emergency Code of Ethics for Arizona, and provided some ethical decision-making guidance. Nevada\u2019s CSC plan (2017) had many similarities to Arizona\u2019s, although did not address issues in the same level of detail.15 Colorado\u2019s plan (2009) had a general discussion of ethics.16 Michigan\u2019s plan (2012) focused on ethics throughout its discussions, and provided excellent descriptions of the key ethical principles.17 Louisiana\u2019s plan (2014) was explicitly based on ethical principles that were clearly defined.18 Finally, Indiana\u2019s plan (2014) thoroughly examined ethical issues with triage and scare resources, but did not explore any other ethical issues.19\n",

These groups prepared different sections, including a dedicated public engagement campaign. This public engagement campaign included public meetings, as well as an online feedback tool to assess public opinion and garner support. Communication during an incident was addressed in 1 section, with multiple communication systems outlined with purposes, administrators, and target audiences.

It went further in some areas to include recommendations for worker/volunteer reimbursement as well as guidelines for parties that fail to meet the CSC specifications.

Indicators and triggers guide transitions along the continuum of care, from conventional to contingency to crisis and then the return to conventional.22 Furthermore, the IOM Toolkit defines a crisis care trigger as the point at which the scarcity of resources requires a transition from contingency care to crisis care, implemented within and across the emergency response system. This is the transition point at which resource allocation strategies focus on the community rather than the individual.

It may be surprising to many readers that nearly 20 states provide no explicit guidance for health-care entities or workers functioning during times of pandemic or crisis. In terms of the IOM elements, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Vermont (draft),25 and Nevada all are comprehensive plans. Each of these 5 plans have similar ethical sections, based on core ethical principles such as justice and fairness, duty to care, and proportionality. They have comprehensive and detailed legal frameworks, including specific federal and state laws. They have well-defined activation and triggers, identifying specific individuals who may activate the plan and when it should be activated. Each plan has considerations for special populations, specifically pediatric considerations.",

Colorado has a manageable length of 88 pages, enough to be thorough but not prohibitive for the average reader. One particular area that makes Colorado an exemplar plan is in the decision for critical care. As we are seeing with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, supplies such as ventilators can be a scarce resource in need of guidelines for allocation. Colorado\u2019s plan has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for critical care, as well as patient prioritization. These exclusion criteria include end-stage organ failure and incurable metastatic disease, among others. Meanwhile, while Arizona and Nevada do have clear inclusion criteria that are similar to Colorado\u2019s, there are no clear exclusion criteria. For example, Nevada\u2019s plan states that the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score may be used to \u201cprioritize admission for ICU-level care or to reallocate scarce medical resources.\u201d In contrast, Colorado\u2019s plan specifies MSOFA scores that should lead to withdrawal of care. \u201cIf a patient has a MSOFA greater than 8 for greater than 5 days, and with flat or rising trend or if a patient ever has a MSOFA score of 15 or higher or any other exclusion criteria, they should be considered for withdrawal from ongoing critical care\u201d.16 Although there is some controversy regarding the use of SOFA scores in exclusion criteria, new literature suggests using the SOFA or the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2 (PELOD-2) scoring systems to predict mortality over the short term.26\n",

New York has a ventilator-specific plan that contains adult guidelines, pediatric guidelines, neonatal guidelines, and legal considerations.10 Another issue that is addressed by the New York plan is the topic of using age as an exclusion factor. Their draft guidelines recommend that \u201cadvanced age should not be a factor that prevents a patient from being eligible for ventilator therapy.\u201d Age is an issue that is avoided by most state plans, but recent literature suggests that it may be used as a tie-breaker in patients who have equivalent prognoses.26 This is referred to as stage of life-related (life-cycle) and suggests that children and adults under the age of 50 be given the highest priority for a ventilator in the event of a tie. As age increases in this model, priority decreases with lowest priority given to adults over the age of 85.",
