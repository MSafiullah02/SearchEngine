            "text": "Disasters have been endemic throughout history. In Judeo history, the flood survived by Noah was about as complete a disaster to contemporary humankind as can be imagined. Egypt was plagued with droughts and floods of the Nile. In Greek/Roman culture, events such as eruptions of Mount Vesuvius caused tremendous suffering and damage. Similar disasters disrupted human activity throughout the world, to include unrecorded events at Easter Island. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies stated that over a recent 10 year period, almost two billion people have been affected by disasters. 1 People in Asia accounted for almost 89% of the population affected by natural disasters between 1975 and 2003. 2 In very recent activity, we have continued to see disasters, such as the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, 3 European flooding in August 2005, hurricane Katrina in the US in September 2005, 4 and Sichuan earthquakes in 2008. These disasters were all geological. There have been biological disasters such as the SARS scare, and the current swine flu virus scare. Nuclear systems receive a great deal of attention, to include the Netherlands, 5 the US, 6 Russia, 7 and elsewhere. Like all governments, the US government expends considerable effort in developing emergency response capability. 8 The US Department of Homeland Security also has systems, to include their Critical Infrastructure Protection Decision Support System (CIPDSS). 9 A common theme is that we are never prepared adequately, yet society copes, and no matter how successful response is, critics abound. 10 We will begin the chapter with a review of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China and the responses to that disaster. We will then review the rich and growing field of emergency management, focusing on the use of modeling and technology to support better response. These tools include database systems, data mining, other forms of quantitative modeling, culminating in emergency management support systems. There are many software products developed to support disaster planning. In a broad sense, they cover data manipulation as well as modeling specific scenarios. Many software providers are moving to virtual services, making their products available on-line. We review a few of the applications involving database systems and data mining, followed by a review and demonstration of emergency management support systems, and one of the financial instruments designed to deal with that aspect of disaster management.",

For a detailed list of large earthquakes all over the world, please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ List_of_earthquakes. Table 6 .2 demonstrates that earthquakes can involve massive loss of life (see the 1,556 earthquake on the list). Earthquakes strike all around the world. In August, 2007 Peru was struck by a 7.9 magnitude earthquake shaking the cities of Ica, Pisco, and Chinca, resulting in 500 deaths and destruction of houses, 11 In May 1970, over 50,000 died in Peru from another 7.9 magnitude earthquake. Earthquakes in Japan threaten a widespread nuclear energy system. An earthquake in 2007 caused a fire at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, leading to leaking of radioactive water into the ocean. As nuclear energy becomes more attractive, environmental groups are concerned about earthquake risk in other areas of Asia, to include Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand. 12 Earthquakes also have had significant political impact (e.g., the Managua Nicaragua earthquake in 1972 has been credited with leading to the Sandinista revolution because of inadequate governmental relief response).",

The chief of the Office of Applied Economics of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology has proposed a three step protocol to prepare for natural disaster in the context of building construction. 16 The first step is to assess risk. Tools available to evaluate risk include standards and software products. The second step is to identify alternative risk mitigation strategies, to include engineering alternatives, management practices, and financial mechanisms. The third step is to evaluate life-cycle economic effectives of alternatives. Some organizations provide standards and software to aid in this third step.",

This step can include initial data collection, data description, data exploration, and the verification of data quality. Data exploration such as viewing summary statistics (which includes the visual display of categorical variables) can occur at the end of this phase. Models such as cluster analysis can also be applied during this phase, with the intent of identifying patterns in the data. \u2022 Data preparation: Once the data resources available are identified, they need to be selected, cleaned, built into the form desired, and formatted. Data cleaning and data transformation in preparation of data modeling needs to occur in this phase. Data exploration at a greater depth can be applied during this phase, and additional models utilized, again providing the opportunity to see patterns based on business understanding. \u2022 Modeling: Data mining software tools such as visualization (plotting data and establishing relationships) and cluster analysis (to identify which variables go well together) are useful for initial analysis. Tools such as generalized rule induction can develop initial association rules. Once greater data understanding is gained (often through pattern recognition triggered by viewing model output), more detailed models appropriate to the data type can be applied. The division of data into training and test sets is also needed for modeling. \u2022 Evaluation: Model results should be evaluated in the context of the business objectives established in the first phase (business understanding). This will lead to the identification of other needs (often through pattern recognition), frequently reverting to prior phases of CRISP-DM. Gaining business understanding is an iterative procedure in data mining, where the results of various visualization, statistical, and artificial intelligence tools show the user new relationships that provide a deeper understanding of organizational operations. \u2022 Deployment: Data mining can be used to both verify previously held hypotheses, or for knowledge discovery (identification of unexpected and useful relationships). Through the knowledge discovered in the earlier phases of the CRISP-DM process, sound models can be obtained that may then be applied to business operations for many purposes, including prediction or identification of key situations. These models need to be monitored for changes in operating conditions, because what might be true today may not be true a year from now. If significant changes do occur, the model should be redone. It's also wise to record the results of data mining projects so documented evidence is available for future studies.",

An immediate huge market then followed: $1-2 billion of issuance per year for the 1998-2001 period, and over $2 billion per year following 9-11 and approximately $4 billion on an annual basis in 2006 following Hurricane Katrina. This market continued to grow rapidly through 2007 because a number of insurers sought diversification of coverage through the market. 43 Table 6 .4 gives market amount of the earthquake bonds in North America and Japan from 1997 to 2007.",

            "text": "Traditional derivative pricing approaches using Gaussian assumptions are not appropriate when applied to these instruments such as CAT bond due to the properties of the underlying contingent stochastic processes. There are evidences that catastrophic natural events have (partial) power-law distributions associated with Year North America Japan their loss statistics. 44 This overturns the traditional log-normal assumption of derivative pricing models. There are also well-known statistical difficulties associated with the moments of power-law distributions, thus rendering it impossible to employ traditional pooling methods and consequently the central limit theorem. Several studies have been done to pricing models with respect to catastrophe derivatives such as CAT bonds. Geman and Yor 45 analyzed catastrophe options with payoff (L(T) -K)+ where L(T) is the aggregate claim process modeled by a jump-diffusion process. Cox and Pedersen 46 priced a CAT bond under a term structure model together with an estimation of the probability of catastrophic events. Dassios and Jang 47 used a doubly-stochastic Poisson process for the claim process to price catastrophe reinsurance contract and derivatives. Jaimungal and Wang 48 studied the pricing and hedging of catastrophe put options (CatEPut) under stochastic interest rates with a compound Poisson process. In contrast, Lee and Yu 49 adopted a structural approach to value the reinsurance contract, where they use the idea of credit risk modeling in corporate finance. They allow the reinsurer to transfer the risk to the capital market via CAT bonds and, in effect, to reduce the risk of the reinsurer's default risk. Since the payments from CAT bonds cannot be replicated by the ordinary types of securities available in financial markets, the pricing has to be done in the incomplete market model. The most important feature of Cat bonds is the conditional payment. Trigger conditions are generally divided into three categories: indemnity-based trigger conditions, index-based trigger conditions and parametric trigger conditions. An indemnity trigger involves the actual losses of the bond-issuing insurer. It is very popular in the early times of Catastrophe bond market. An industry index trigger includes an industry index, e.g., an index created from property claim service (PCS) loss estimates. A parametric trigger is based on quantitative parameters of the catastrophe event, for example, earthquake magnitude, central pressure wind pressure, wind speed, rainfall of hurricane and so on.",
