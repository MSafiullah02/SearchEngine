Only 20\u201330% of patients with dementia respond appropriately to conventional drugs, and the onset of adverse drug reactions imposes the need for other drugs to neutralize side effects, thus multiplying the initial cost of the pharmacological treatment and the health risk for the patients [7]. Wimo et al. [8] studied the economic impact of dementia in Europe in the EU-funded Eurocode project and found that the total cost of dementia in EU27 countries in 2008 was estimated to be \u20ac160 billion (\u20ac22,000 per dementia patient per year), of which 56% were costs of informal care. The corresponding costs for the whole of Europe were \u20ac177 billion. Informal caregiver costs were the largest cost component, accounting for about half to just over 60% of total societal costs, depending on the country and AD severity [9].",

The pharmacological management of dementia is an issue of special concern because of the polymedication required to modulate its symptomatic complexity where cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and psychomotor deterioration coexist. In parallel, a growing body of fresh knowledge is emerging on the pathogenesis of dementia, together with data on the neurogenomics and pharmacogenomics of CNS disorders. The incorporation of this new armamentarium of molecular pathology and genomic medicine into daily medical practice, together with educational programs for the correct use of drugs, must help researchers and clinicians to (1) understand AD pathogenesis; (2) establish an early diagnosis; and (3) optimize therapeutics either as a preventive strategy or as formal symptomatic treatment [7], [12].",

Transcripts of 16,896 genes have been measured in different CNS regions. Each region possesses its own unique transcriptome fingerprint that is independent of age, gender, and energy intake. Fewer than 10% of genes are affected by age, diet, or gender, with most of these changes occurring between middle and old age. Gender and energy restriction have robust influences on the hippocampal transcriptome of middle-aged animals. Prominent functional groups of age- and energy-sensitive genes are those encoding proteins involved in DNA damage responses, mitochondrial and proteasome functions, cell fate determination, and synaptic vesicle trafficking [14].",

Mendelian mutations affect genes directly linked to AD, including 32 mutations in the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) gene (21q21)(AD1), 165 mutations in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene (14q24.3)(AD3), and 12 mutations in the presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene (1q31\u2013q42) (AD4) [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. PSEN1 and PSEN2 are important determinants of \u03b3-secretase activity responsible for proteolytic cleavage of APP and NOTCH receptor proteins. Mendelian mutations are very rare in AD (1:1000). Mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene appear with a frequency of 0.30% and 0.78%, respectively, in AD patients. Likewise, PSEN1, PSEN2, and microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT)(17q21.1) mutations are present in less than 2% of cases. Mutations in these genes confer specific phenotypic profiles to patients with dementia: amyloidogeneic pathology associated with APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations and tauopathy associated with MAPT mutations represent the two major pathogenic hypotheses for AD [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21].",

Significant interactions include target SNPs present in seven genes related to AD prognosis with the miRNAs miR-214, -23a and -23b, -486-3p, -30e*, -143, -128, -27a and -27b, -324-5p, and -422a.

Resident microglia fail to trigger an effective phagocytic response to clear A\u03b2 deposits, although they mainly exist in an \u201cactivated\u201d state. Oligomeric A\u03b2 (oA\u03b2) can induce more potent neurotoxicity when compared with fibrillar A\u03b2 (fA\u03b2). A\u03b2(1\u201342) fibrils, not A\u03b2(1\u201342) oligomers, increase microglial phagocytosis [51]. Among several putative neuroinflammatory mechanisms, the TNF-\u03b1 signaling system has a central role in this process. In AD, TNF-\u03b1 levels are altered in serum and CSF. The abnormal production of inflammatory factors may accompany the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Abnormal activation of the TNF-\u03b1 signaling system, represented by increased expression of sTNFR1, is associated with a higher risk of progression from MCI to AD [52].",

The removal of \u03b2-amyloid, or the prevention of its buildup, has the potential not only to correct \u03b2-amyloid-related toxicity, but also to prevent the formation of neurofibrillary tangles\u2022Conformational changes of endogenously occurring proteins and the formation of insoluble aggregates are commonly associated with neurodegeneration and brain disease, so the removal or prevention of these pathologic protein aggregates is also a therapeutic goal in the principle of immunotherapy\u2022Immunotherapy works in experimental animals and in initial clinical trials: both active immunization and passive antibody transfer consistently reduce brain \u03b2-amyloid load, improve \u03b2-amyloid-related memory impairments, and protect neurons against degeneration in many independent experiments using different mouse models and primates [90]\n\n",

Increased levels of tau oligomers have been observed in the early stage of AD, prior to the detection of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formed by aggregation and accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau [92]. Several approaches have been taken to treat AD by targeting tau, such as the following:1.The inhibition of tau hyperphosphorylation, by a kinase inhibitor of soluble aggregated tau formation, which also prevents related motor deficits [93].2.Activation of the proteolytic pathway, by the degrading action of calpain [94] and puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase [95].3.The stabilization of microtubules, treating tauopathies by functionally binding and stabilizing microtubules with mt-binding protein tau [96] and paclitaxel, a drug proven effective in restoring affected axonal transport and motor impairments [97].4.Tau clearance by immunotherapy in this case, the tau active vaccination uses phosphorylated antigens of tau fragments associated with neurofibrillary tangles [98] that results in an efficient reduction of both soluble and insoluble tau active fragments, reducing phosphorylated NFTs in AD-like mouse brains.\n",

A recent immunization study has proven that a fragment of the A\u03b2 peptide bound to polylysines activates the immune response that diminishes AD-like pathology in APP transgenic mice. This result reinforces the notion that the immune-conjugate approach is an effective means of A\u03b2 immunotherapy, and also that the entire A\u03b2 peptide is not necessary for its efficacy. It is in accordance with the hypothesis that specific antibodies directed against the amino-terminal and/or central region of the amyloid peptide provide beneficial protection against amyloid pathology. Passive immunization studies have also been conducted with promising experimental results, showing that a humoral response alone, without A\u03b2 cellular response, is sufficient to reduce the \u03b2-amyloid burden and reverse memory deficits [101].",

It is a transport enzyme of the cytochrome P450 subfamily IID or multigenic cytochrome P450 superfamily of mixed-function monooxygenases. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. CYP2D6 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is known to metabolize as many as 25% of commonly prescribed drugs, and more than 60% of current psychotropics. Its substrates include debrisoquine, an adrenergic-blocking drug; sparteine and propafenone, both antiarrhythmic drugs; and amitryptiline, an antidepressant.

The hepatic cytochrome P450 system is responsible for the first phase in the metabolism and elimination of numerous endogenous and exogenous molecules and ingested chemicals. P450 enzymes convert these substances into electrophilic intermediates, which are then conjugated by phase II enzymes (e.g., UDP glucuronosyltransferases, N-acetyltransferases) to hydrophilic derivatives that can be excreted.

Oligomer binding involves the C-terminal domain of ApoE, with ApoE3 reporting a much greater response through this conformational marker. ApoE3 displays a higher affinity and capacity for the toxic A\u03b2 oligomer. ApoE polymorphism and AD risk can largely be attributed to the reduced ability of ApoE4 to function as a clearance vehicle for the toxic form of A\u03b2. MAPT and APOE\nare involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of AD, and both the MAPT H1/H1 genotype and the APOE \u025b4 allele lead to a more rapid progression to dementia among MCI subjects, probably mediating an increased rate of amyloid-\u03b2 and tau brain deposition [27].",

These 20 major phenotypic features clearly illustrate the biological disadvantage of APOE-4 homozygotes and the potential consequences that these patients may experience when they receive pharmacological treatment for AD and/or concomitant pathologies [7], [12], [23], [24], [25], [28], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59].Box 27.2Key Conclusions Regarding APOE-Related AD Phenotypes\n1.The age at onset is 5\u201310 years earlier in approximately 80% of AD cases harboring the APOE-4/4 genotype.2.The serum levels of ApoE are lowest in APOE-4/4, intermediate in APOE-3/3 and APOE-3/4, and highest in APOE-2/3 and APOE-2/4.3.Serum cholesterol levels are higher in APOE-4/4 than in other genotypes.4.HDL-cholesterol levels tend to be lower in APOE-3 homozygotes than in APOE-4 allele carriers.5.LDL-cholesterol levels are systematically higher in APOE-4/4 than in any other genotype.6.Triglyceride levels are significantly lower in APOE-4/4.7.Nitric oxide levels are slightly lower in APOE-4/4.8.Serum and cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b2 levels tend to differ between APOE-4/4 and the other most frequent genotypes (APOE-3/3, APOE-3/4).9.Blood histamine levels are dramatically reduced in APOE-4/4 as compared to the other genotypes.10.Brain atrophy is markedly increased in APOE-4/4>APOE-3/4>APOE-3/3.11.Brain mapping activity shows a significant increase in slow wave activity in APOE-4/4 from the early stages of the disease.12.Brain hemodynamics, as reflected by reduced brain blood flow velocity and increased pulsatility and resistance indices, is significantly worse in APOE-4/4 (and in APOE-4 carriers in general, as compared with APOE-3 carriers); brain hypoperfusion and neocortical oxygenation is also more deficient in APOE-4 carriers.13.Lymphocyte apoptosis is markedly enhanced in APOE-4 carriers.14.Cognitive deterioration is faster in APOE-4/4 patients than in carriers of any other APOE genotype.15.In approximately 3\u20138% of AD cases, some dementia-related metabolic dysfunctions accumulate more in APOE-4 carriers than in APOE-3 carriers.16.Some behavioral disturbances, alterations in circadian rhythm patterns, and mood disorders are slightly more frequent in APOE-4 carriers.17.Aortic and systemic atherosclerosis is more frequent in APOE-4 carriers.18.Liver metabolism and transaminase activity differ in APOE-4/4 with respect to other genotypes.19.Hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors accumulate in APOE-4 carriers.20.\nAPOE-4/4 carriers are the poorest responders to conventional drugs.\n\n",

Both are necessary in CNS disorders and dementia to cope with efficacy and safety issues associated with current psychotropics and antidementia drugs, as well as new CNS drugs. With regard to the future of pharmacogenomics as a practical discipline, several issues should be addressed:\u2022The education of physicians in medical genomics and pharmacogenomics is fundamental (less than 2% of clinicians are familiar with genomic science)\u2022Genomic screening of gene clusters involved in pharmacogenomic outcomes must become a clinical routine (without genetic testing, there is no pharmacogenetics)\u2022Each patient must be a carrier of a pharmacogenetic card [140] indicating what kind of drugs he/she can take and which medications he/she should avoid\u2022Regulatory agencies should request pharmacogenetic data from the pharmaceutical industry when applying for drug approval\u2022Pharmacogenetic data must be incorporated into patient information leaflets and the pharmaceutical vade mecum\n\u2022New guidelines for daily praxis, such as those given in the World Guide for Drug Use and Pharmacogenomics\n[113], will promote understanding of the relationship between drugs and genes to make drug prescription truly personalized\n",

Since only 25\u201330% of the population is an extensive metabolizer for drugs metabolized via CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 enzymes, it seems reasonable to use pharmacogenomic procedures as a way to optimize AD therapeutics, thus reducing ADRs and unnecessary costs. The therapeutic response to conventional drugs in patients with AD is genotype-specific, with CYP2D6-PMs, CYP2D6-UMs, and APOE-4/4 carriers shown to be the worst responders.
