We recommend seeking the advice of the hospital's infectious disease department to consider surgery in a patient with COVID-19. In our centers, scheduled patients are hospitalized 48 hours before surgery. If the patient is asymptomatic, we perform a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening test on the patient's arrival. If the patient is symptomatic, we perform 2 screening tests 24 hours apart, combined with a computed tomography scan of the chest. The same procedure is applied for patients arriving in emergency adjusted to the required delay of surgery. Antibodies are not routine tests at this time. As soon as they will be available and reliable, they probably should be added to the screening strategy and coupled with the PCR technique to optimize preoperative screening.",

The precautionary principle should be followed, given the absence of follow-up on this disease (risk of asymptomatic case, risk of second contamination of the patient, risk of carrying the virus longer).3)If a coronavirus diagnosis is made after surgery, it is necessary to identify all the surgical staff who have been in contact with the patient and consider quarantining them after advice from the infectious disease department.\n",
