Acute lung injury (ALI) also constitutes the causative factor for the other organ chaos [1]. Thus, it is important to prevent and cure the respiratory dysfunction for the improvement of treatment in multiple organ dysfunctions (MODS) [2]. However, compelling evidence indicates that the remedy of ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on the ventilation function support and anti-inflammatory treatment remains unsatisfied [3\u20135]. Actually, the key point to treat the ALI and ARDS is to realize both the structural remodeling and functional repair, and recover the normal gas exchange. Presently, the potential measures to realize the repair and regeneration of injured adult lung tissues is to activate the self repairing potential through an extra- or intra-pulmonary route [6, 7], and improve the local pulmonary microenvironment so as to promote the reconstruction of breathing function. During these complex courses, the principal biological event is that stem/progenitor cells are synergistically involved in the repair of injured lung tissues (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "Bone marrow is the largest pool for the storing of stem cells, which constitutes the principal source of stem/progenitor cells outside the lungs. The potential repairing cells include bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells (BMSCs), epithelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) [8]. During acute injury, infections or the mobilizers\u2019 administration, they egress from the bone marrow pool and may directionally migrate towards the injured lung tissues under the guidance of chemokines. Finally, they are involved in the repairing courses in the differentiated cell types [9]. Intravenous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is known to induce mobilization of BMSCs to peripheral blood, while their increased homing to sites of injury would improve tissue healing. Also, the mobilizers could induce the increase of bone marrow-derived EPCs in the murine model of emphysema [10], inducing angiogenesis in injured lungs through mobilizing EPC [11]. Similarly, in the patients suffered from bacteria pneumonia and ALI, the number of circulating EPCs is obviously increased, which is even related to their prognosis. In turn, the mobilizing capacity of bone marrow-derived EPCs is impaired after ARDS [12], indicating the necessity of improvement of bone marrow mobilization so as to promote the pulmonary repair. Meanwhile, mobilization of HSPCs and colony formation capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated great significance after ALI [13\u201315]. All these findings indicate that the bone marrow-derived stem/progenitor cells exhibit the mobilizing courses, and play a substantial role in the regression of excessive inflammatory responses and repair in injured lungs. In addition, recent researchers found that ALI with endotoxin or NO2 does not enhance development of airway epithelium from bone marrow [16], suggesting that the expansion and proliferation of endogenous bone marrow-derived stem/progenitor cells toward airway descendants are further required once their mobilization occurs.",

The allograft of bone marrow MSCs are easily tolerated for the acceptors due to the low expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I, II and co-stimulator molecules in T cells. Thus, these theoretically reasonable cells are further stored until use without ethical disputation. In recent years above 130 clinical trials of MSCs have been registered and carried out. Bone marrow MSCs have been proved to efficiently alleviate the lung injury and promote the recovery courses [18], partly due to the immunoregulatory effects [19, 20]. Meanwhile, administration of MSCs via the vein or trachea also reduces the LPS-induced ALI, alleviating the chest impact injury and hyperoxia-induced lung injury, reversing the pathological reduction of pulmonary surface area and the blunted breathing function in rodents [21, 22]. Bleomycin-induced inflammation, collagen deposition and fibrosis were also attenuated after the MSCs injection [10]. The conditioned medium for MSCs culture further showed similar therapeutic effects on pulmonary function [23]. Hence, bone marrows MSCs possess the prospective clinical value for the repair and regeneration in ALI.",

Also, inhaled NO contributes to the repair of injured lungs in piglets via increasing circulating endothelial progenitor cells [29]. The number of EPCs is positively related to the animal survival. From the clinical point of view, the increased number of EPCs in the pneumonia patients is the innocent representation of self repair in bodies. If the number of circulating EPCs didn\u2019t increase in ALI [12], these patients might have distressing outcome, indicating the great necessity for supplementing the EPCs in combination with immune modulatory measures.",

Actually, ADSCs could secrete vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) when promoting the angiogenesis.

The alveolar epithelium is composed of the flat alveolar type I (AT1) cells comprising 95 % of the gas-exchange surface area and less than 5 % of cuboidal alveolar type II (AT2) cells comprising the rest. Once ALI occurs, AT1 cells showed injury, necrosis or apoptosis. Then, rare, long-lived, mature AT2 cells could differentiate and substitute the disabled AT1 cells in the injured area [64, 65]. At this moment, some of AT2 cells were found to become hypertrophy, which is easily discriminated in various injured lung tissues. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity of AT2 cells had been presented and classified with three subgroups including the alveolar renewal focus, alveolar repair focus and AT2 replacement focus [66]. Further, the subgroup of stem cells were shown to exist within the AT2 cells, which were found to widely distribute in the terminal bronchiole, bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ) and alveolus. In comparison, the contribution of AT2 cells is more significant than bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) concerning the numerical preponderance and differentiation potential [67, 68]. Some murine AT2 cells can also generate BASCs unexpectedly [69]. Therefore, during the course of pulmonary remodeling after ALI, the efficient shift of repair potential in AT2 cells including the number, distribution and cellular transfer path should be undoubtedly weighted.",

Robust preclinical literature has showed that AT2 cells could repair the injured alveolar epithelium. However, the potential of pulmonary endogenous stem cells to substituting the injured AT2 cells remains unclear. To address this question, new findings suggested that the murine stem cell antigen (Sca)-1 positive cell may be the endogenous lung stem cell although it could not found in rats [70]. The cell number with stem cell marker (Sca-1, CD34 and c-kit) increased in the elastase-induced lung injury. The combination of HGF and elastase could synergistically increase the number of Sca-1+/SPC+ cells. Most of the Sca-1+ belong to the endogenous lung stem cells while most of the c-kit+ cells come from the bone marrow [70, 71]. Therefore, the increase in the number of endogenous lung stem/progenitor cells is in great need for the repair of injured lung tissues. In recent years, Zhang and colleagues [72] found that the excitation of Wnt signal pathway could significantly increase the number of BASCs. The pharmacological modulators, lithium may also promote the amplification and differentiation of specific stem cell group in the lung tissues [73], which supplies the new avenue for the endogenous repair of injured lungs on the basis of pulmonary stem cells.",

Nonetheless, the HLSCs researches proved their in vitro c-kit positive characteristics, which were further confirmed using the in vivo experimental models. Also, some experimental preparations have been given for the potential clinical usage. But it remains a long way to go before the clinical engraftment for HLSCs. First, how efficient is the HLSCs engraftment. Whether does the newborn lung tissues differentiated from HLSCs possess the normal physiological function? Second, how is the feasibility of HLSCs engraftment? For the patients suffered from the lung diseases, whether their HLSCs lose the self proliferative and multidirectional differentiation capacity owing to the infaust pulmonary microenvironment? Third, whether does the variant engraftment of HLSCs has the same therapeutic effect compared with their auto transplantation? Finally, there remains a series of technique bottle neck from their isolation and culture to engraftment.",

Although the action of MSCs is not completely clear in the lung regeneration, the beneficial effects of MSCs on the lung injuries have been extensively investigated. MSCs can secrete diverse cytokines and growth factors. Co-culture of LPS-stimulated lung cells and MSCs could result in the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating that the soluble mediators may inhibit excessive inflammatory responses, or the direct interactions of lung cells and MSCs could produce the anti-inflammatory effects. Similar results have showed that the immunoregulatory role of MSCs on immune cells (T cells, B cells and NK cells). Other studies reported that the intra trachea administration of pulmonary stem cells with the MSCs phenotype attenuated the elastase-induced emphysema [84]. The transplanted stem cells can reach the alveolar space besides some of them reserved in the alveolar wall. These results didn\u2019t support the idea of cell differentiation, but indicated their immunoregulatory effects in the injured lung tissues. In addition, new mechanisms included the mitochondria DNA transmission between the MSCs and other cytosolic components through intercellular bridges, which may regulate the cellular biological ability in the recipient cells [85]. Hence, the protective effects of MSCs are rather the anti-inflammatory effects than the differentiation towards the lung cells.",

Likewise, the researches concerning their microenvironment regulation demonstrated that the stem/progenitor cell-derived conditioned medium possesses the similar efficacy, suggesting that the secreting factors (IL-10, IL-RN, VEGF, angiopoietin-1) act as the anti-inflammatory and pro-reparative mediators on the gas-blood barrier in ALI [86\u201389]. Moreover, microvesicles containing anti-inflammatory mRNA and miRNA secreted by the stem/progenitor cells also possessed the therapeutic potential during the repairing courses [90\u201392]. Second, BMSC could protect against oxidative stress in Escherichia coli-induced ALI in mice [93], and ameliorate seawater-exposure-induced ALI by inhibiting autophagy in lung tissues [94]. Concurrently, they could restore sodium transport and preserve epithelial permeability in an in vitro model of acute alveolar injury [95]. Third, BMSC could reduce inflammation while enhancing bacterial clearance in bacterial pneumonia [96, 97]. Fourth, the number of a population of Clara cells possessing secreting capacity; named bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) were increased in ALI [98]. The ex vivo colony formation experiments proved that the proliferation of BASCs was maybe due to MSCs but not growth factors. The therapeutic effect of MSCs on the chronic bronchopulmonary dysplasia showed that BASCs help the reconstruction of pulmonary epithelial structure. So, the repairing effects of MSCs maybe realize via the stimulation of BASCs proliferation, demonstrating the peculiarly promoting effects of extra pulmonary stem cells on the lung stem cells during the repair and regeneration.",

Hence, the potential contamination and bio-safety should be carefully considered (Table 2). Once the transplantation procedure is completed, the turnover of these stem/progenitor cells should also be further controlled to lower the risk of graft rejection and teratoma formation [107\u2013109]. In comparison, the greatest advantage of endogenous stem/progenitor cells lies in the good safety only required to use the mobilizers or activating elements for their redistribution within the bone marrow, blood and lungs. However, the constraint of cell numbers especially in the blunted mobilization responses for some patients may deteriorate the therapeutic efficacy. In addition, other important findings have reported that there exist some differences between MSCs from bone marrow, placenta and umbilical cord blood in terms of their immunosuppressive properties against T cells [110].",

Likewise, the autotransplantation is preferentially selected compared with allotransplantation. Second, aging stem/progenitor cells were showed to have impaired migration and anti-inflammatory responses as well as abnormal immunosuppressive properties against T cells [110, 112], indicating the selection of young stem/progenitor cells is in preference. Third, the delivery routes for stem/progenitor cell transplantation are also comparable. The therapeutic effects via intraperitoneal route were slightly inferior to intravenous route in amiodarone induced lung injury in rats [113]. So, the reasonable transplantation route (venous, trachea, intrapleural or intraperitoneal pathway) should be carefully considered for the ideal therapeutic efficacy (Fig. 1).",

Hence ways are being sought to either engraft stem/progenitor cells or fetal lung cells that will form pulmonary structures to the severely injured lungs, or build bio-artificial lungs that completely replace the depleted. However, owing to the complicated three-dimensional tissue structure and above 40 cell types, lungs are difficult to be artificially constructed perfectly. Recently, several artificial lung models have been presented. The essential researches utilized the scaffold material that supports the development of alveolar-like epithelia and endothelia from fetal lung cells. Meanwhile, the decellularized lungs were also repopulated with fetal lung epithelial cells delivered via the trachea and lung endothelial or human umbilical cord vein cells through the pulmonary artery. The constructs were then cultured in a bioreactor where the cells regenerated region-specific tissue with the characteristics of normal alveolar tissue before transplantation. Although these cells need to be carefully investigated before the clinical usage, the integrity of lung stroma remains to be resolved, and the gas exchange capacity is limited, the concept of bio-artificial lungs may supply a candidate replacement measure for the severe lung injury owing to its low immune rejection and controlled organ origin, which might throw sunshine on the 50 million end staged-patients with ALI.",

            "text": "To the end, the endogenous lung remodeling, repair and regeneration has become the new avenue for the refractory lung diseases. However, the following concerns remains to be added. First, most of successful ALI experiments were accomplished with rodents [114]. Their lungs in thoracic cavities possess the energetic proliferating capacity in the whole life period which is quite different from human lungs because the transplantation of exogenous stem/progenitor cells into matured human lung tissues seems difficult at least owing to our limited insight in the HLSC. But the initiation of endogenous stem/progenitor (self renewal, proliferation, migration, and differentiation) is safe and maybe efficient via some modulators (KGF, HGF, retinoid acid, etc.). Second, in view of the bio-safety of endogenous stem/progenitor cells and the quantity constraint of exogenous stem/progenitor cells, it may be reasonable to consider the combination of these two types of cells in the ALI therapy. Third, the repair and regeneration of injured lungs is complicated. We should emphasize the microenvironmental regulation via the neuroendocrine immune network [115, 116]. Only in this way may the stem/progenitor cells possess the ideal biological capability (migration, mobilization, chemotaxis and homing, expansion, differentiation and proliferation). Such good \u201csoil\u201d may benefit these \u201cseed\u201d cells in the remodeling and regeneration of injured lungs. Fourth, regarding the complicated cell types in lungs, the integration of inflammatory modulation and pro-repair factors\u2019 increase may help inhibit their deleterious injury and promote the structural remodeling. The potential measures should consider the synergistic combination of statins plus retinoid acid, statins plus HGF, etc. Fifth, concerning the stem/progenitor cell pool of the bone marrow, and the energetic reservoir of the stem/progenitor cell pool of placenta, umbilical cord and amnion during the perinatal period, the selection of compositive stem/progenitor cell populations maybe benefit ALI treatment more than a single stem/progenitor cell population, which has been partly confirmed by the previous studies of mononuclear cell populations in the bone marrow [117]. Sixth, concerning their robust protective capacity via paracrine/endocrine mediators released by stem/progenitor cells, it is valuable to develop some stem/progenitor cell-derived therapeutic fluid similar to the conditioned medium of stem/progenitor cell in combined with the microvesicles for the ALI therapy. Finally, from the previous experience in the research of bio-artificial lungs, it is valuable to deeply emphasize the contribution of extracellular matrix while using stem/progenitor cells, which might pave the road for the pulmonary integrity in the lung remodeling and regeneration (Fig. 3).",
