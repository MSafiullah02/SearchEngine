Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13.

            "text": "Coronavirus, first discovered in the 1960s [1] , is a species of enveloped positive-sense RNA virus classified under the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and the subfamily Coronavirinae (see Figure 1 ). These are viruses that can infect the cells of certain vertebrate hosts and can be characterized by their club-like spikes protruding from the surface [2] . The subfamily Coronavirinae can be split into four main genera of coronavirus on the basis of their serological and genomic properties, that is, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Betacoronavirus can be further split into four lineages A, B, C, and D (see Figure 1 ). The recently identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now classified into subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus lineage B Betacoronavirus [3, 4] . Due to the widespread availability, large genetic diversity, and frequent recombination of the coronavirus species, in conjunction with the increased time humans spend in the presence of animals, coronaviruses are occasionally able to mutate to infect human hosts [5] . From the list of coronaviruses discovered thus far, there are six species that have been known to infect human hosts (also known as HCoV), causing mild to serious respiratory symptoms depending on the lineage of the coronavirus as well as the immunocompromised nature of the patients [6] . The new coronavirus, initially named the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, was first discovered when a cluster of patients reported symptoms of pneumonia of unknown cause to local Chinese health facilities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in early December 2019 [5] . However, the original source of the novel coronavirus is unclear. On February 11, 2020, the 2019-nCoV was given the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as announced by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses in reference to the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) naming guidelines [7] . The timeline development of SARS-CoV-2 is shown below (see Figure 2 ). In the past 20 years, there have been other zoonotic and pathogenic coronaviruses that have led to global or regional outbreaks, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although not identical, much could still be learned from these previous outbreaks with knowledge and experience incorporated into the current efforts on understanding the SARS-CoV-2 as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment.

According to some studies on animal samples taken from live-animal markets in Guangdong, it was found that masked palm civets and two other species had already been infected by the SARS-CoV. Because SARS-CoV is zoonotic, this led to the tentative large-scale culling of the masked palm civets. However, further studies later revealed that there were no widespread infections found in wild or farmed civets and clinical symptoms of SARS were only shown to be overt in the civets sold at the markets [9, 10] , suggesting that civets were highly unlikely to have been the primary/natural reservoir host. The study of Li et al. [9] drew attention to bats and their ability to host several zoonotic viruses whilst rarely displaying any clinical symptoms. In addition, the increased consumption of bats or bat-based products in southern China aroused suspicion that bats might be the primary host of the SARS-CoV. Upon collecting and testing the serum samples and cDNA of 408 bats from nine species, six genera, and three families, Li et al. observed that SARS-CoV tested positive only in different species of horseshoe bats from the Rhinolophus genus [9] . These observations concluded that horseshoe bats were the primary hosts of SARS-CoV, which had subsequently passed it on to other intermediate hosts such as civets and eventually to humans [6] .",

Full-length genome sequences were released at the early stage of the outbreak. The study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to a bat coronavirus at the whole-genome level and it belongs to the species of SARS-CoV [14] . A transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of SARS-CoV-2 is shown below in Figure 3 . According to a test carried out by Phan et al. [2] , the nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was compared with other types of already known coronaviruses using a pair-wise sequence analysis, and the test results demonstrated an 88% nucleotide similarity to bat-SARS coronavirus (see Figure 4) , which was the most similar to SARS-CoV-2 by a significant margin compared to the rest of the known zoonotic coronaviruses with less than 50% nucleotide similarity. Although not definitive, this suggests that the Huanan seafood wholesale market was potentially closely linked to the virus source with other sources, suggesting that bats were the primary reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.

MG772934.1) and ZC45 (MG772933.1), and 82% identical to that of SARS-CoV Tor2 (JX163927), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 also belongs to betacoronavirus lineage B, but has closer homology to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 than SARS-CoV [16] . Structural analysis of the spike (S) protein of this new virus showed that its S protein only binds weakly to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cells, whereas the human SARS-CoV exhibits strong affinity to the ACE receptor [17] . Despite this, the binding strength between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is still much higher than the threshold required for virus infection [13, 18] . Although this is important in showing the potential for human-to-human transmission, it also shows that binding with ACE2 receptor may not be the only factor affecting virus transmission.

            "text": "From a study conducted by Chen et al. [13] , medical reports of 99 patients up to January 25, 2020, were examined. The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 82 years old, with a mean age of 55.5. Approximately 32% of the patients were female and 68% male. From this sample of patients, about half of them were suffering from other underlying cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. It would appear that older individuals and/or individuals with compromised immune system are at a greater risk of infection. In addition, although preliminary, it would seem as though there is a link to the sex of patients. The lower number of female patients, as observed in this particular group of patients, could potentially be attributed to their natural immune system protection from X chromosomes and sex hormones (see Figure 5A ) [13] , which are known to play a key role in innate and adaptive immunity [24] and thus less susceptible to various infections. That being said, further observations and studies are needed to confirm this relationship. The patients also displayed various clinical symptoms, such as fever (83%), cough (82%), shortness of breath (31%), muscle ache (11%), confusion (9%), headache (8%), sore throat (5%), rhinorrhea (4%), chest pain (2%), diarrhea (2%), and nausea and vomiting (1%) (see Figure 5B ). Approximately 90% of the patients were observed to have more than one of the symptoms, whereas 15% experienced fever, cough, and shortness of breath simultaneously. Laboratory tests displayed an overall fall in the value of lymphocytes, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly target lymphocytes, specifically T lymphocytes, by spreading through the respiratory mucosa, triggering immune responses and negative changes in the immune system. This would potentially cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock in some patients, leading to eventual organ failure [13] . [30] . The median age was 47, and 58.10% were males. The common clinical symptoms were fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%). Ground-glass opacity (50.0%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (46.0%) were typically found on chest computerized tomography (CT) scans. Figure 7 shows ground-glass opacity in the infected lungs of both male and female COVID-19 patients of similar age range. The median incubation period is 3.0 days (with incubation period ranging from 0 to 24 days). COVID-19 has a relatively lower fatality rate than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It was found that the mortality rate of 1.4%, based on the larger sample size studied, is lower than that reported previously [13, [30] [31] [32] . As of February 13, 2020, a total of 1370 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported with 60,412 confirmed cases in 25 different countries. According to a live update, the number of deaths resulting from the COVID-19 is shown to be rising with an overall daily growth factor of over 1, which suggests an exponential growth in the number of deaths January 23, 2020, to February 13, 2020 (see Figure 6 ) [25] [26] [27] . According to a study on medical reports carried out by Zhao et al., the total number of unreported cases from January 1 to January 15, 2020, was estimated to be 469, with a growth factor of 2.56 [28] .",

The routes of transmission might have accelerated the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Apart from respiratory droplets and direct contact, which serve as the conventional routes of transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and highly pathogenic influenza [32, 35, 36] , fomite transmission was found to be a potential reason for the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [30] .",

In another study carried out by Chan et al., six family members who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, China, were monitored. Five of them were tested positive for the COVID-19, despite not having come in contact with any of the markets or animals in Wuhan where the outbreak is believed-although not definitively-to have started. An additional family member was also reported to have contracted the disease several days after coming in contact with four of the family members. This observation further reinforces the fact that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from a human host to another human host [37] . This also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to undergo mutation and adapt to infecting human hosts more easily than before, creating the urgency to find methods to contain the mutation. A method of predicting whether or not these mutations will lead to further infectivity in the future is available but has yet to be conducted and validated [17] .",

Thus far, all human-to-human infections have been classified as second generation transmission, and there have yet to be any known cases of third generation transmission, which is a human infecting another human who was previously infected by another human. If this were to occur, it could spell out an increase in the reproduction number and the possibility of the virus transmitting [38] . Apart from China, human-to-human transmission has been reported in other countries such as Germany, Japan, Thailand, and the United States [39] . In a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), it was reported that the first four cases of the COVID-19 in Germany were associated with a businesswoman from Shanghai who travelled to a company in Munich on January 20 and 21. The four people whom she met soon started experiencing clinical symptoms, and it was later reported that the businesswoman herself was not experiencing symptoms at the time, leading experts to believe that asymptomatic patients are able to transmit the SARS-CoV-2 as well. Although it was later found out that the businesswoman had suppressed the symptoms with paracetamol [40] , there is yet enough evidence to rule out the potential of asymptomatic transmission.",

On the basis of the time-scale phylogenetic analysis of the virus genome sequences, the potential large \"first generation\" human-to-human virus transmission is estimated to have occurred on November 9, 2019 [44] . Similarly, phylogeographic analysis of the two geographical locations with earliest confirmed cases reported (primarily Wuhan, China, and Bangkok, Thailand [45] ) revealed that most viral transmissions between epidemiologically linked cities potentially originated from Wuhan, with a posterior probability of 0.98 [44] , rather than from Bangkok. However, more evidence and studies will be needed to confirm the origin.",

As the aforementioned studies approximated the virus incubation period at 5.2-12.5 days, the expected epidemic doubling time of COVID-19 could be in the range of 2.9-8.4 days. The probability of outbreak in locations outside of Wuhan is estimated on the potential individual-level variation in transmission, in which the increase in variation will result in lower possibility of an outbreak, whereas the increase in transmission homogeneity will most likely establish an outbreak in a new location. Researchers anticipated 50% possibility [47] of an outbreak occurring in a new location by assuming a SARS-like variation and a Wuhan-like transmission in the study model.",

The analysis of the major structural proteins including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelop (E), and nucleic capsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 showed that the coronavirus exhibits a high degree of variation from the human SARS virus and should be categorized as a novel type of bat coronavirus [17] . As the transmission of coronaviruses to human is, in part, driven by the interaction of spike proteins (S protein) with human receptors ACE2, researchers have utilized the Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the docking and binding processes of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2 [52] . Simulation results showed that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 is 73% similar to SARS-CoV, suggesting its S protein has been encoded by its genome to process human receptor-binding ability and thus it is highly possible that it can drive human-human transmission. On the other hand, the transmissibility from the infection source to human is simulated on the basis of a reservoir-human transmission network model. The matrix employs the SEIR model for both infected source and human population. As the R 0 varies with every updated input into the matrix, the model suggests that if R 0 > 1, the outbreak will occur; if R 0 < 1, the outbreak will be terminated [53] .",

One of the prescribed antiviral medications for patients suffering from COVID-19 is oseltamivir, which is normally used for treating influenza in adults, children, and infants older than 2 weeks of age who have experienced clinical symptoms for no more than 2 days. Oseltamivir is classified under a class of medicines known as neuraminidase inhibitors that work by stopping the spread of the virus throughout the body, shortening the time in which the flu symptoms last [68] . Neuraminidase inhibitors promote the release of virus from infected cells and facilitate viral movement within the respiratory tract.

Remdesivir inhibits viral replication by initializing efficient metabolic conversion in cells and tissues to activate nucleoside triphosphate which, in turn, deactivates viral RNA polymerases [75] . Remdesivir has been shown to have a diminishing effect on the pathological features of acute lung injury (ALI), a common clinical feature observed in COVID-19 patients. Previously, in vivo studies have shown that lung injury scoring was significantly reduced in MERS-CoV-infected mice treated with remdesivir [72] [73] [74] . Sections of the lung tissue appeared to have a lower concentration of debris and inflammatory cell deposition, thus facilitating a more efficient gas exchange in the lungs as compared to those of untreated mice with ALI [72] [73] [74] . Apart from lung injuries, some COVID-19 patients have also developed secondary infection and septic shock, a widespread infection throughout the body that would result in multiple organ failures. Non-human primate tissue distribution studies have shown that remdesivir can effectively penetrate and distribute into immune-privileged sites, including the eyes, genital tracts, and some extent of the brain, which could be a persistent reservoir for viruses [75] . This would allow remdesivir to provide a wider coverage of antiviral effect to different organs in the body and thus reduces the possibility of virus accumulation in immune privileged sites. This indicates the potential of remdesivir as an antiviral drug to treat COVID-19 patients.",

Antiviral treatment, primarily using oseltamivir, ganciclovir, and KALETRA (a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir), is prescribed to treat the ARD and to minimize the potential of septic shock. In parallel, most patients are also given either single or a combined treatment of antibiotic agents, namely, cephalosporin, quinolone, and carbapenem to prevent secondary infection and to strengthen the immune system.

The oxygen therapy eases symptoms of hypoxemia and prevents further organ damage. Renal replacement therapy replaces nonendocrine kidney function in patients with renal failure.

In addition, 100% of the patients received antibiotics treatment, 66% of patients were on oxygen therapy, and 7% of patients were given CRRT. The discharge rate from hospitals was as high as 68% [31] . Similar combined treatment has reported promising results in a collective study involving 1099 patients in 552 hospitals across 31 provinces in mainland China [30] . In another epidemiological study involving 99 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan [13] , a combination of oseltamivir, ganciclovir, and KALETRA was prescribed to 76% of the patients. A total of 25% of the patients were provided with single antibiotic treatment, whilst 45% of the patients received multi-antibiotic treatments. Of the patients in this study, 76% and 9% were on oxygen therapy and CRRT, respectively. Eventually, 31% of patients were discharged from hospital. In addition, several studies [81, 104, 105] have reported the effective use of KALETRA in suppressing the activity of SARS-CoV-2. Medical teams in China [13] , Singapore [99] , Malaysia [100] , and Thailand [97] have observed promising effects of KALETRA in combination with other medical interventions to treat COVID-19 patients, leading to many being discharged from hospitals. That being said, at present there is no available vaccine and medical treatment that could prevent COVID-19 infection. In addition, continuous on-going efforts are needed, both theoretical and clinical, to fully understand SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 for more effective treatment and prevention.",

            "text": "The recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic outbreak is an ongoing crisis that is causing global uncertainty on an unprecedented scale. The zoonotic pathogen, identified as an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus with 96.2% similarity to that of a bat coronavirus (termed BatCoV RaTG13), is believed to have originated from infected bats and is transmissible between animals and humans, as well as between humans and humans, with up to 24 days of incubation period. By February 13, 2020, there were a staggering 60,412 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 1370 fatalities reported worldwide. Although the current mortality rate of COVID-19 is relatively low at approximately 2% compared to SARS (9.6%) and MERS (35%), the SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has infected more patients than both SARS and MERS combined over a shorter period of time. A significant amount of collective work has been done in China and globally in the first 75 days of the outbreak, particularly in understanding the novel coronavirus, as well as in devising prevention and treatment strategies. Strict containment measures have been effectively implemented throughout China, particularly in infected areas, preventing uncontrolled spreading. Statistical studies have shown that the reproduction number (once as high as 5.7) has been on a declining trend, indicating lower spreading rates through containment and strict isolation measures. Promising medical interventions have been administered to COVID-19 patients with a total of 6271 patients discharged from hospitals in various countries (as of February 13, 2020). That being said, there are no available vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 and little is still known about the post-effects of the COVID-19. Clearly, continued effort from across the world will be needed to fully understand the coronavirus family in order to prevent further and future outbreaks. ",
