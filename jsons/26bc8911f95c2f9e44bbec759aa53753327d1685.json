The paucity of published data is illustrated by a book on acute leukemia, published in 1958, which made no mention of infectious complications [1] .

The subsequent use of multiple drug combinations in acute lymphocytic leukemia and Hodgkin disease represented major advances [2] . Another important advance was the use of platelet transfusions to control and prevent hemorrhage in acute leukemia patients with thrombocytopenia [3] . In an autopsy study, the frequency of hemorrhage as a cause of death in acute leukemia patients decreased from 67 to 37% due to the use of platelet transfusions [4] . Unfortunately, infection remained a major cause of death.

Surveys in the 1960s found that about 80% of patients with acute leukemia, 75% with lymphoma, but less than 40% of patients with metastatic carcinoma developed infection [12, 13] . There are a wide variety of factors that may impact on the susceptibility of cancer patients to infection [11] . Local factors such as tumor masses that may obstruct the bronchial tree or urinary tract and necrotic tumors in the gastrointestinal tract can result in infection. In an autopsy study of children with metastatic carcinoma, 80% of cases of pneumonia were associated with pulmonary metastases, aspiration, or tracheostomy [14] . Antibiotic therapy is often of limited efficacy in these types of tumors, unless the local predisposing factor can be removed.",

            "text": "Neutropenia is the most important predisposing factor and can be due to the disease or its therapy. While there were some reports of the role of neutropenia in infection, a detailed analysis of 52 patients with acute leukemia was published in 1966 [15] . This study demonstrated that the risk of infection was related to the degree and duration of neutropenia. The risk increased when the neutrophil count was less than 1,000/ mm 3 , but increased substantially when it was below 500/ mm 3 . Also, the risk of developing infection increased the longer the duration of neutropenia. One hundred percent of episodes of severe neutropenia (<100 PMN/mL) lasting 3 weeks or longer were accompanied by identifiable infection compared to 65% of episodes lasting one week. Neutropenia diminishes the likelihood of detecting characteristic manifestations of infection. One study compared physical findings of infection in a group of patients with severe neutropenia with a group with adequate neutrophil counts [16] . Only 8% of patients in the former group with pneumonia were able to produce purulent sputum compared to 84% in the latter group. Similarly, among patients with urinary tract infections, pyuria was found in 11 and 97%, respectively. In an autopsy study, it was demonstrated that many pulmonary infections were not detected on routine chest radiographs antemortem [17] . Likewise, among patients with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia, 85% of those with initially abnormal chest radiographs had >1,000 neutrophils/mL, whereas 81% with normal roentgenograms had <1,000 neutrophils/mL [18] . The lack of signs of infection in febrile neutropenic patients impairs the physician's ability to determine whether or not fever is due to infection. In one study of fever in neutropenic patients, physicians were required to conclude whether infection was present or not before instituting therapy [19] . The physician's initial diagnosis (infection or fever of unknown origin) was incorrect in 33% of the cases.",

            "text": "White blood cell (WBC) transfusions were initiated in an effort to improve the outcome of infections in severely neutropenic patients. Since it was difficult to collect sufficient neutrophils from normal donors, initially, patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia with high neutrophil counts were used as donors [20] . Later, the development of the continuous cell separating machine made it possible to collect adequate cells from normal donors [21] . Studies demonstrated that there was a direct relationship between the number of cells transfused and the increment in the recipient's neutrophil count. In one study of 128 neutropenic patients who had fever unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, 49% responded after WBC transfusions, including patients with pneumonia and gram-negative bacillary septicemia [22] . Unfortunately, potential adverse effects occurred in some recipients. In one study when WBC transfusions were administered with amphotericin B, 64% of patients developed acute dyspnea, respiratory deterioration, and new pulmonary infiltrates compared to only 6% of patients who did not receive amphotericin B [23] . Several other studies failed to observe this toxicity. Another potential adverse event primarily for bone marrow transplant recipients was acquisition of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection [24] . Reports of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a few recipients has led to routine irradiation transfused cells, but questions have been raised about adverse effects of radiation on the function of the transfused neutrophils. In a review of seven prospective randomized trials of WBC transfusions in neutropenic patients with infection, it was concluded that the transfusions were of some benefit in five studies but the number of patients in each study was small [25] . A problem with many was the ignoring of the number of neutrophils administered; hence, some patients received an inadequate dose. The use of WBC transfusions diminished by the 1980s because there was inadequate evidence of their efficacy from prospective comparative studies. However, there has been a resurgence of interest in increasing available neutrophils since recombinant myeloid growth factor granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has become available. Administration of G-CSF to donors improves the number of neutrophils collected as well as increases their activity against infection [26] .",

These units provided filtered air, sterile water supply, sterile room, specially prepared food, and toilet facilities. The patients were given specifically prepared \"sterile\" food and prophylactic oral and topical antibiotics. These rooms, air, food, and patients were carefully monitored for microbial contamination [28, 29] . The program reduced the frequency of infection and permitted the use of more intensive chemotherapy in the premyeloid growth factor era. Unfortunately, more intensive chemotherapy in this setting did not result in higher remission rates for several malignancies including acute leukemia [30] , lymphoma [31] , and sarcoma [32] . One review of protected environment entitled \"Protected Environment are discomforting and expensive and do not offer meaningful protection\" summarized the discussion as follows \"The one constant in almost every controlled study is that life has not been prolonged, remission induction increased, nor remission prolonged\" [8] .",

Exceptions were those with cellular immune defects due to the neoplasm such as Hodgkin's disease, who might present with cryptococcosis or those with multiple myeloma who might present with pneumococcal septicemia because of their decreased production of normal immune globulins. In the neutropenic patient, the organisms invading from the nasopharynx were usually Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus (penicillin susceptible). From the orointestinal tract, Escherica coli and Klebsiella or Proteus species were responsible; these bacteria were sensitive to most available antibiotics during early 1950s. Gradually, but steadily, resistance developed in most of the organisms except S. pyogenes. S. aureus resistant to penicillin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to all antimicrobials except polymyxin appeared in the late 1950s [4, 33, 34] . Antimicrobial resistance developed over the years among the orointestinal isolates and the Gram-positive cocci increased to become predominate by the 1980s with MRSA and penicillin-resistant First type of protective environment for severely neutropenic patients.

The diseases are due to organisms from all categories including Salmonella spp., Histoplasma capsulatum, Leishmania spp., and CMV. In the early 1980s and with the advent of the AIDS epidemic, investigators with access to laboratories where T cells could be measured began systematic studies that revealed that patients with levels in the 200 range or lower would develop one or more of these opportunistic infections, especially PCP. It became apparent that as the T cells fell, it could be predicted which organisms would cause disease [8, 35] .

New culture methods include isolator lysis centrifugation tubes which are used for continuous around-the-clock monitoring employing a fluorescent carbon dioxide detection system. An automated broth system can be used for quantitation by colony counts of centrifuged sediments and these systems are more sensitive for the isolation of some fungi, mycobacteria and Bartonella species. In addition, the broth can be examined by nucleic acid probes and HPLC for rapid organism identification. Automated broth Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) antimicrobial susceptibility tests yield more rapid results which can be entered into online computer systems for clinicians and recorded for antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for hospital infection control.

It became the predominant cause of fatal infection in neutropenic patients [4] . Once effective antibiotics became available for treatment of penicillin-resistant S. aureus, gram-negative bacilli emerged as the most common cause of fatal infections. Pseudonomas aeruginosa became a major cause of infections, especially among neutropenic patients [29, 37, 38] . Although polymyxin B and colistin were very active in vitro against the pathogen, they were ineffective for therapy in neutropenic patients and were of limited benefit in other patients. Their efficacy in neutropenic patients depended upon the recovery from neutropenia. The availability of carbenicillin, the first b lactam with anti-pseudomonal activity, had a dramatic impact on the therapy of life-threatening Pseudomonas infections [39] . Other gram-negative bacilli emerged as significant pathogens, including Klebiella spp. and Serratia marcescens. Cephalothins were the first b lactam available for the treatment of some of these infections [40] . Over the years, multiplicity of antibiotics has been developed including potent broad-spectrum cephalosprosins, carbapenims, and fluoroquinolones [41] . Despite these important advances, bacterial infections remain a serious threat to cancer patients, due in large part to the ability of organisms to develop resistance to multiple antibiotics. Recent increase in nonpseudomonal nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has been associated with difficult-to-treat healthcare-associated infections; these bacteria may also cause less severe community-acquired infections [42] ; high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the treatment of choice, although occasionally a multidrug-resistant organism poses a serious challenge [43] . Emergence and spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae and recently identified carbapenemases producing Klebsiella species (KPC) and spreading to other gram-negative disease-associated bacteria herald alarming limitation in choice for effective antimicrobial therapy against these new groups of MDR-gram-negative bacterial infections [44] .",

After multiple antibiotics became available and the potential for emergence of resistance became apparent, it became the standard practice to withhold antibiotic therapy in the febrile patient until the infecting pathogen was identified. However, early studies of antibiotic therapy for fever in neutropenic patients clearly indicated the importance of instituting antibiotic therapy promptly to neutropenic patients when they become febrile. It has been demonstrated that mortality rates increase substantially if therapy is not administered promptly. The choice of initial antibiotic therapy should provide broad-spectrum antibacterial coverage against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. Most infections are caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic infections tend to be uncommon. It is of critical importance for physicians caring for neutropenic patients to be aware of the common pathogens causing infections at their hospitals and their antimicrobial susceptibilities so that appropriate antibiotic regimens will be selected. Antibiotics that are bactericidal should be selected when possible. The greatest experience has been obtained with broad-spectrum b lactams and aminoglycosides. Aminoglycosides are less effective as single agents in neutropenic patients and should not be used alone [49] .",

Disseminated infection is often difficult to diagnose because there may be few signs and symptoms except fever and progressive debilitation and the organism is often not cultured from blood specimens. About 10% percent of patients have multiple skin lesions [69] . There is a chronic form of disseminated candidiasis that occurs in neutropenic patients, which persists after neutrophil recovery and is characterized by persistent fever, debilitation, weight loss, and in some patients, hepatosplenomegaly and right upper quadrant pain [70] [71] [72] . Mortality rates have been as high as 70% among patients treated with amphotericin B. Fluconazole prophylaxis has been associated with a significant increase in drug-resistant Candida krusei and Candida glabrata breakthrough disseminated infections [73] [74] [75] . Other alternatives are lipid formulations of amphoterician B and echinocandins. Neutrophil recovery is a critical factor in recovery from candidiasis.

Lipid formulations of amphoterician B are also used in combination with other mold-active drugs. Neutrophil recovery and discontinuation of systemic immunosuppressive therapy, especially adrenal costicosteroids, are important for recovery from the infection.

Similarly, amebiasis and giardiasis are infrequently seen in patients from rural residences who consume water from shallow contaminated wells. Latent Toxoplasma gondii infection is difficult to diagnose on the bases of travel, food consumption, or history of domestic feline exposure; serology may be diagnostic, although in patients with B-cell defects PCR analysis may be needed. Malaria is mostly seen in patients traveling to endemic regions without prophylaxis or receiving ineffective chemoprophylaxis due to drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium species. \"Airport malaria\" has also been seldom reported in patients who reside near airports with frequent international flights. Transfusion malaria has been observed in patients with neoplastic diseases and should be considered and explored in the presence of unexplained fever [106] . Chaga's disease has also been transmitted by transfusions adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma; antineoplastic agents like cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and HHV6: Human herpesvirus 6 L. donovani and L. infantum may lead to serious visceral leishmaniasis. L. donovani is seen in Africa and Asia, L. infantum is seen in Africa, Europe, Mediterranean, and Central and South America. VZV is rarely associated with systemic dissemination in patients with humoral immune defects, or even those with mixed immune dysfunctions. Strongyloides stercoralis may lead to serious, life-threatening hyperinfection syndrome in patients with marked cellular immune defects causing fevers and pericardial effusions [107] . This disease may become more common as the number of potential donors coming from endemic areas increases and also the reduvid bug appears to be moving north into southwestern states. Screening donors may become necessary. A recent increase in fatal Babesia species infection reported since November 2005 in the US has raised concerns of this rare intraerythrocytic parasite disease [108] .",

Catheter removal reduces risk of infection recurrences [113] , and in patients with high-grade bacteremia or candidemia with or without hemodynamic compromise, the catheter should be removed immediately. A thorough evaluation for underlying endovascular infection such as septic thrombophlebitis may yield a source of persistent bacteremia, lack of complete response, and influence duration of systemic antimicrobial therapy. Factors that influence antimicrobial choice include (a) penetration of drug in the biofilm, (b) antimicrobial activity within the biofilm, and (c) activity against the nonplanktonic stationary phase of the microorganisms [114] .
