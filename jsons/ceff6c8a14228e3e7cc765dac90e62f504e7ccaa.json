However, a number of states have now begun to ease these restrictions. Here, we evaluate the effects of loosening stay-athome orders on COVID-19 incidence and related outcomes. We use a metapopulation model applied at county resolution to simulate the spread and growth of COVID-19 incidence in the United States. We calibrate the model against county-level daily case and death data collected from February 21, 2020 to May 2, 2020, and project the outbreak in 3,142 US counties for 6 weeks into the future. Projections for daily reported cases, daily new infections (both reported and unreported), new and cumulative hospital bed demand, ICU bed and ventilator demand, as well as daily mortality, are generated.",

While it is certainly possible that strong social distancing practices enforced in stores, restaurants and theaters, as well as increased use of face masks, could offset any increases in person-to-person contact, congregation in common spaces and associated increased opportunities for virus transmission, it is likely that a return to greater activity will reverse some of the gains, i.e. reductions of virus transmissibility, accrued over the last 6 weeks, particularly if initial re-openings do not produce an immediate growth of cases and consumer confidence grows.",

However, in states that reopen, we apply an increase to the contact rate of counties in those states.

In the second scenario, the contact rate is increased by an additional 10% each week to represent progressive loosening of restrictions and increased public confidence and frequenting of businesses. A third comparison scenario assumes no effect due to reopening, and instead applies 20% weekly reductions in contact rates for all counties meeting the criteria described above, and as in Pei and Shaman 1 .

This model has been described previously in Pei and Shaman 1 and has been used since March 13, 2020 to make biweekly projections of COVID-19 incidence, hospitalizations and deaths. The model represents two types of movement: daily work commuting and random movement. Information on county-tocounty work commuting is publicly available from the US Census Bureau 2 , which is used to determine rates of intercounty movement prior to March 15, 2020. We assume the number of random visitors between two counties is proportional to the average number of commuters between them. After March 15, 2020, we use SafeGraph estimates of the reduction of inter-county visitor numbers in points of interest (POI) (e.g., restaurants, stores, etc.) to inform the decline of inter-county movement on a county-by-county basis. For instance, if the number of out-of-county visitors was reduced by 30% in a county on a given day comparing with the baseline on March 15, 2020, the size of subpopulations traveling to this county would be reduced by 30% accordingly. During projection into the future, we maintained the most recent level of inter-county movement.",

As such, even a small increase in the contact rate can drive Reff greater than 1, which would then lead to a rebound in transmission and a lagged increase of confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths. These findings indicate that most states are not well-positioned to re-open their economies and simultaneously control the spread of COVID-19 infections. Both scenarios with increasing contact rates in reopening states resulted in a rebound in COVID-19 incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths at the national scale (Figure 2 ). The rebound was faster and stronger for the weekly-increase scenario. Notably, the increase in cases and deaths is not apparent at the national scale until two to four weeks after the first states begin to reopen.

Firstly, the model is optimized using observations through May 2, 2020; however, those observations, i.e. confirmed cases and deaths by county, represent infections that were acquired by individuals 1-3 weeks earlier. Because of this long delay, the effects of changes in social distancing and contact patterns over the last 3 weeks on virus transmission have yet to be fully observed.",
