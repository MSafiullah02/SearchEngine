            "text": "34 million new cases of hRSV-associated ALRTI occur in children younger than 5 years and as much as 200,000 deaths are estimated annually. 12 Indeed, hRSV causes a minimum of 3.4 million hospitalizations per year in the United States. 12 Due to the high hospitalization rates and increased health care system costs, hRSV infections are considered a major public health burden globally. For instance, medical costs related to hRSV infection in hospitalized individuals is estimated at 394 million USD annually, just in the United States. 13 Thus, safe and effective vaccines against this virus are urgently needed. hRSV spreads rapidly and efficiently throughout the population by inhalation of aerosolized droplets of infectious viral particles, or directly through the contact of these droplets with the ocular mucosa. 14, 15 One of the most relevant characteristics of hRSV infection is the capacity to produce high reinfection rates in individuals during epidemic outbreaks. For instance, epidemiological studies indicate that approximately 36% of individuals can be reinfected at least once during a given season. 13, 16, 17 Based on the current evidence, these reinfection episodes may be due to the elicitation of a deficient or hampered cellular and humoral immune memory after a first exposure to the virus. 4, [18] [19] [20] Bronchiolitis is one of the most severe illnesses caused by hRSV infection. The term bronchiolitis is referred to distal bronchiole inflammation and obstruction. Such an obstruction reduces the airflow into small airways and causes an alteration in the exhalation capacity. This phenomenon can lead to lung hyperexpansion, lung function alterations, increased mucus production, atelectasis, and wheezing. 21, 22 Furthermore, infection of alveolar epithelium by hRSV leads to pneumonia, which prevents an efficient gas-exchange process. Such infection triggers distal airway inflammation, leading to severe pulmonary disease. 22 The initial response against hRSV infection is given by the airway epithelial cells (AECs), which promotes the recruitment of effector immune cells at the site of infection. hRSV-associated immunopathology is characterized by the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the subsequent perivascular/peribronchial infiltration by mononuclear cells, mainly neutrophils and lymphocytes. 21 This exacerbated inflammation is thought to trigger an unbalanced and pathogenic T helper (Th)2 response.",

This proteolytic cleavage generates three polypeptides, in which C-and N-terminal (F1 and F2 subunits) polypeptides are linked by two disulfide bonds. 11, 34 The active form of the F protein in the viral particles is a trimer in a prefusion conformation. 35 This protein mediates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane by changing its conformation to a postfusion form after interacting with the receptor. 36 Importantly, the F protein can interact with different proteins on the surface of host cells, such as TLR4, 37 ICAM-1, 38 and nucleolin. 39 Particularly, nucleolin has been described as the main hRSV receptor that interacts with the F protein, because it was shown that nonpermissive cells expressing nucleolin became susceptible to hRSV infection. 39 Furthermore, no new virions could be made after infection with a mutant virus lacking this protein. 40 These data suggest that the F protein is one of the most important hRSV proteins contributing to infection and interaction with host cells.",

            "text": "Below the virus envelope lie the other viral proteins, namely, proteins N, P, L, M, and M2-1. 29,31 The nucleoprotein N is in close contact with the viral genome and is thought to protect the viral RNA from nucleases and together with P and L proteins constitute the hRSV ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which regulate the transcription and replication of the viral RNA. 52,53 Importantly, the N protein prevents the genomic RNA from forming double-stranded RNA structures, as well as RNA cleavage by host components. 54 Noteworthy, its structure with viral RNA has been recently determined. 55, 56 The N protein is generally located within cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, where it interacts with the M2-1, P, and L proteins. During the first hours after infection, the N protein has been shown to associate within these structures with MDA5 and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), which contribute to the innate immune response. 57 The sequestering of these molecules by the N protein would cause a poor detection of viral genome by these nucleic acid sensors, which could dampen the antivirus interferon (IFN) response. 57 Importantly, it has been recently described that the N protein can be expressed on the surface of infected epithelial and dendritic cells (DCs). 58 Expression of this protein impairs the capacity of hRSV-infected DCs to activate T cells, probably due to a blockade of the interaction of peptide-MHC (pMHC; MHC, major histocompatibility complex) complexes with the T-cell receptor (TCR). 58 Such novel role for the N protein has provided new insights relative to the localization of this protein and how hRSV can interfere with the induction of protective T-cell responses, which is often impaired by hRSV infection. 3, 19, 58 The viral phosphoprotein P has been described as a cofactor of the RNP complex and the most important for the L protein. Indeed, the P protein can interact with N protein, allowing it to access the L protein. 52, 59 The P protein is highly stable as a tetramer and the C-terminal domain (P CTD from the residue 161 to the residue 241) is critical for the interaction with the L and N proteins. [60] [61] [62] Consistent with this notion, the phosphorylation of the P protein has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis mediated by the virus, as a virus lacking the five phosphorylation sites in this protein shows reduced replication in vivo in mice and cotton rats, as well as in vitro in HEp-2 sites. 63 However, this recombinant virus can replicate normally in Vero cells, thereby suggesting that the phosphorylation of the P protein is necessary for an efficient viral replication. 63 The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) L protein is the lesser expressed of all viral proteins in the infected host cells. The principal role of this protein is the replication and transcription of the viral genome, regulated and supported by the RNP complex. 64 Because hRSV is a negative sense RNA virus, the L protein transcripts the genome directly into mRNA for the expression of each hRSV gene. 59 In this process, the L protein recognizes a promoter region in the 3\u2032 extreme of the negative RNA strand and starts the transcription of each gene. Accumulating evidence suggests that transcription is modulated by the N protein. 52,53,59 During the replication process, the L protein copies the complete virus genome from a negative sense RNA into a positive sense RNA, which is called an antigenome. This RNA is then used as a template to generate new negative sense RNA, which finally will be encapsided in the virions. 59,65 A typical characteristic of the L protein is that in the process of transcription, it generates a gradient of gene expression, from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032, producing more mRNAs of the genes 3\u2032 as compared with those 5\u2032 in the genome. 66, 67 The matrix protein M promotes viral assembly and is essential for hRSV replication. 68 Early after infection, the M protein is located in the nucleus, where it is able to decrease the transcriptional activity of the host cells genes. [69] [70] [71] Another role of matrix protein is to arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase, as shown in A549 cells. It also arrests the G1 and G2/M phases in human bronchial epithelial cells. 72 These actions, which are p53-dependent, increase hRSV replication. 72 In addition, the M protein is directly related to the maturation of viral filaments. 73 In this line, it has been described that hRSV strains that are null for the M protein show significantly lesser infective progeny particles. 73 Moreover, not only lesser new viral particles are generated but also protein trafficking is affected, particularly with the N protein being concentrated in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, before virus budding. This phenomenon suggests that M protein is important for triggering the trafficking of viral proteins to the budding site. 73 Other studies show that the M protein is expressed in inclusion bodies and interact with the M2-1 protein, as a means to interact with the RNP complex. 74 The M protein is also capable of inhibiting viral transcription and interact with hRSV G and F proteins to signal the assembly of the virions. 75, 76 The M2-1 protein is involved in the transcription process as part of the RNP complex, and acts as an antitermination/ elongation factor promoting the transcription of all hRSV genes, aiding the L protein to proceed with transcription of viral genes. 77 Interestingly, it was also showed that NS1 and NS2 genes can be transcribed by the L protein independently of the hRSV M2-1 protein, suggesting that several transcription mechanisms for viral genes exist. 77 To exert its antitermination functions, M2-1 needs to form as tetramers. 78 Importantly, without this oligomerization, the protein cannot function correctly, which is supported by using a mutant virus for M2-1 protein that cannot generate tetramers. 78 As M2-1 is part of the RNP complex, this protein can interact with different protein of this complex. 74, [78] [79] [80] [81] The interaction with the N protein is particularly mediated through interactions with the viral RNA, as treatment with RNAses disrupts this binding. 80 Another function of this protein is the activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and its association with the RelA protein. 82 On the other hand, the M2-2 protein is involved in the regulation of transcription to the replication by the virus polymerase. 83, 84 This effect was discovered by studying an \u0394M2-2 virus, in which the accumulation of mRNA was higher in cells infected with this mutant virus, as compared with WT virus. 84 In addition, viral titers were reduced over 1,000 times in the first 5 days and over 10 times after 7 to 8 days when the \u0394M2-2 virus was used. 84 Thus, these two proteins play a critical role in the regulation of transcription and replication of hRSV RNA.",

            "text": "Besides the structural proteins mentioned earlier, the hRSV genome also encodes two nonstructural proteins, namely, NS1 and NS2, both with the capacity to interfere with host type 1 IFN innate response. This process negatively modulates DCs maturation and T-cell responses. 85, 86 The NS1 protein interferes with the activation of the IFN gene promotor by inhibiting the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). 87 NS2 also can interfere with the activation of IRF-3 by its interaction with retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), inhibiting the activation of IFN response genes (IFNRs). 88, 89 The NS1 protein is able to interrupt the signaling of JAK/STAT pathways that are activated by IFN receptor pathways, particularly through the degradation of STAT-2. 88,89 Both proteins, NS1 and NS2, are able to promote phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways promoting the survival of infected cells, increasing viral yield. 90 In this line, interference with the type 1 IFN response by NS1 and NS2 proteins blocks DCs maturation. 86 Concomitantly, \u0394NS1/NS2 and \u0394NS1 viruses are able to increase the expression of maturation markers on DCs compared with WT hRSV. 86 Furthermore, this effect in DCs could interfere with their capacity to activate T cells. 85, 86 Indeed, human DCs infected with a \u0394NS1 virus show increased activation and proliferation of CD8\u00fe T, increase the activation and proliferation of Th17 protective cells, and decrease the activation of IL-4 \u00fe CD4 \u00fe T cells, which are related to increased hRSV pathogenesis. 85 In addition, a recent study showed that the expression of NS1 and NS2 proteins by human bronchial epithelial cells decreases the polarization of T cells toward Th1, Th2, and Th17 phenotypes by the NS1 protein, and Th2 and Th17 polarization by the NS2 protein. 91 Thus, these two nonstructural proteins are very important virulence factors that directly affect the immune response of the host.",

            "text": "The infection of target cells, such as airways epithelial cells (AECs), starts with the attachment of virions to the cell surface aided by the G protein, which interacts with heparan sulfates and chondroitin sulfate B glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). 92 After this interaction, which helps the virus approach the membrane of the cell to be infected, the F protein contacts its receptor, nucleolin (\u25baFig. 2). 39 The entry of hRSV has been described to occur particularly in cholesterol-rich microdomains on the cell surface. 93 Further, the fusion membranes require the participation of Pak-1 in the rearrangement of actin filaments. 93 Entry via endocytosis has been discarded because the use of Dynasore shows that, despite dynamin-endocytic process is inhibited, viral fusion still occurs. 93 Therefore, the fusion of the hRSV membrane with the host cell membrane depends on the interactions of hRSV G and F proteins with their receptor and the rearrangement of actin filaments close to cholesterolrich microdomains (\u25baFig. 2). 32, 93 The fusion of the viral and cell membranes triggers the release of the viral nucleocapsid content into cytoplasm. Here, the nucleocapsid is dissociated from the RNP complex and repetitions of the M protein, which is mediated by the phosphorylation of the P protein (\u25baFig. 2). 94 Importantly, this process is mediated not only by viral proteins but also by host cell enzymes, such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) \u03b2 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). 94 The transcription process mediated by the function of L protein mainly occurs in cellular inclusion bodies together with N and P proteins. 95 As mentioned earlier, the L proteins associated with the P protein are able to recognize the promotor region on the 3\u2032 of viral RNA, and initiate transcription of viral genes. 59, 67 The polymerase initiates transcription in gene start (GS) regions carrying out mRNA capping and methylating the 5\u2032 of the messenger. 59, 67 Then, the L polymerase recognizes a gene end signal at the end of the mRNA and carries out polyadenylation. 59, 67 This process goes on again after recognition of a new GS sequence downstream of a previously transcribed gene. It is known that the minimal proteins required for transcription are N, P, and L. The M2-1 protein also appears to be important because of its ability to interact with all RNP proteins, [78] [79] [80] [81] included with the M protein. 74 Furthermore, host proteins are also involved in the transcription process; for instance, profilin, an actin-modulatory protein, is required for an optimal transcription. 96 Additionally, host heat shock proteins (HSPs) are also involved in this process, particularly HSP90 and HSP70. Both proteins are expressed in lipid rafts and are associated with the viral RNP complex. Recently, it was described that HSP90 is critical for the stability and functionality of the L polymerase and that HSP70 is necessary for efficient RNA synthesis. 97, 98 When the viral genome is repli-cated, the L polymerase recognizes the TrC promoter region at the 3\u2032 of the antigenome and generates genomic hRSV-RNA. 99 This new RNA strand is immediately encapsulated by the N protein. 59 Virus assembly, after viral RNA transcription and replication, depends on the M protein localization and occurs at cholesterol-rich domains. 73,100 As described earlier, at the beginning of the infection cycle, the M protein is transported to the nucleus by the interaction with importin-\u03b21, where M protein can interfere with cellular transcription (\u25baFig. 2). 69, 70 The M protein is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by a Crm1-dependant nuclear signal so that it localizes to lipids rafts. 71 When the M protein is associated with these domains, the assembly and budding process begins and involves interactions with surface proteins F, G, and SH. 101 Accordingly, a recent report showed that the F and G proteins are expressed on the surface of ciliated cells. 102 Thereafter, the interaction of the F protein with the M proteins promotes assembly of the new virions (\u25baFig. 2). 103 On the other hand, the M2-1 protein has been shown to bind to the M protein, promoting its assembly with the RNP complex. 74 The formation of filaments that contain the virions is regulated by the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase enzyme, which mediates changes in F-actin to generate viral filamentous projection that are involved in cell-to-cell transmission. 104 Finally, the budding process is not regulated by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery, as occurs for other enveloped RNA viruses. In its place, hRSV budding is controlled by the RAB11 family interacting protein 2 (FIP2), 105 which has been described as a novel pathway for this type of process. Taken together, the hRSVinfective cycle depends of three main processes: (1) hRSV protein localization, where inclusion bodies and rich cholesterol sites are principal places where the hRSV proteins can be founded; (2) hRSV protein interaction, the particular interaction between RNP complex and accessory proteins for replication and transcription and the interaction of M protein to surface protein triggering the virion budding; and (3) interaction of host cell proteins with hRSV proteins and structures, principally how host cells help in the release of nucleocapsid at the beginning of the process and how a novel process of budding depends of host proteins (\u25baFig. 2).",

CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells have been shown to play pivotal roles in both hRSV clearance and pathogenesis. Such a dichotomy in the role of virus-specific T cells has been observed for infection, and also lung damage after challenge with the virus. 126 For instance, T cells expanded in mice experimentally infected with hRSV have been shown to be essential for the clearance of the hRSV, although this immune response causes an exacerbated activation of the immune system within the airways. 127 Similarly, mice immunized with a vaccine Fig. 3 Immune response trigged by hRSV infection in respiratory airways. hRSV reaches the lower respiratory tract and is recognized for respiratory epithelial cells by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed leading to the secretion of innate cytokines and chemokines such as TSLP, IL-13, and IL-25. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines promote the recruitment of innate immune cells into the lungs, such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and monocytes. The inflammatory environment induced by the innate immune cell recruitment and mucus production together with an excessive Th2 and Th17 response generate destruction of the respiratory epithelium and the obstruction of distal bronchiolar airways.",

Consistent with this notion, depletion of CD8 \u00fe T cells reduced the severity of hRSV-induced disease during primary and secondary infection. 133 Such detrimental responses have been suggested to occur because CD8 \u00fe T cells play a role in the regulation and activation of the CD4 \u00fe T cells toward Th2 polarized phenotypes. 134 On the other hand, a reduction of intracellular granzyme B content, diminished secretion of IFN-\u03b3, and impairment of perforin expression have been observed in CD8 \u00fe T cells in the lungs of hRSV-infected individuals. 135, 136 Inefficient T cells against hRSV have been reported in infected individuals. 137, 138 Such suppression of T-cell activation is thought to be due to an impairment of DC-T cell immunological synapse assembly, which has been observed by a decrease in Golgi polarization in T cells cultured with hRSV-infected DCs 3 (\u25baFig. 4). This impairment of immunological synapse assembly also causes improper TCR engagement, leading to the failure of antigen-specific T cells priming. 3 Interestingly, these authors reported that DC-derived soluble factor mediators were not involved in this suppression. 3 By contrast, alteration of cytokine secretion surrounding the DC-T cell environment by hRSV have been shown to modulate T cell response. 139 Furthermore, hRSV has also been observed to alter the quantity of surface cognate peptide-MHC, impairing T cell activation. 140 Likewise, secretion of Th1-like cytokines is reduced in hRSV-infected DCs and may decrease cytotoxic T cell activity. 3 Taken together, immunological synapse is a fine system that could be exploited by hRSV at multiple levels. Thereafter, further research is needed to elicit mechanisms of hRSV to interfere in the immunological synapse.",

            "text": "Epidemiological data suggest that hRSV infection may cause neurological complications in 1.2 to 1.8% of the cases. 6,163 These neurological alterations include seizures, central apnea, lethargy, feeding or swallowing difficulties, tone abnormalities, strabismus, abnormalities in the CSF, and encephalopathy. 26, [163] [164] [165] Acute encephalopathies resulting from viral infection have been classified into three mayor types: metabolic error, cytokine storm, and excitotoxicity. 166 The etiology of the encephalopathies induced by hRSV infection remain unclear. However, an association between the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and free radicals in the CSF has been extensively associated with neurological complications. For instance, IL-6, IL-8, and nitrogen oxide are increased in the CSFs of hRSV-infected patients, thereby suggesting that a cytokine storm may be involved in the pathogenesis of hRSV encephalopathy (\u25baFig. 5 and \u25baTable 1). 163, 166, 167 Indeed, increased protein levels, cell infiltration, and low glucose levels have been observed in the CSF of hRSV-infected patients. 26 Interestingly, CSF abnormalities have also been detected in infants with no apparent neurological symptoms, suggesting that hRSV can induce subclinical neurological alterations. 168 Furthermore, brain imaging of patients with acute hRSV encephalopathy is also unclear. These findings include diffuse edema, an abnormal shifts of fluid in various compartments of the brain parenchyma, that involves the entire cerebral cortex and subsequent diffuse brain atrophy, which results in loss of neurons and the connection between them. 163 Central apnea and seizures are the most frequent neurological alterations described in clinical reports. 169 Nevertheless, the frequency of neurological complications can reach up to 40% in children younger than 2 years with critical consequences due to severe hRSV infection. 6 Supporting evidence for an association between neurological alterations and hRSV infection is the detection of viral RNA and specific antibodies against hRSV in CSF of patients with neurological alterations (\u25baFig. 5). Furthermore, several studies have shown that encephalopathy-associated hRSV patients display altered cytokine profiles, as compared with patients infected with hRSV and bronchiolitis, but without neurological alterations. 167, 170 Central apnea can occur in up to 21% of children admitted into the clinic after hRSV infection. It has been proposed that hRSV infection can cause disruptions in neural control pathways by reducing nonadrenergic and noncholinergic inhibitory responses, which eventually may cause the central apnea symptom. 171, 172 Further, hRSV causes abnormal cholinergic responses in an animal model, which suggests that hRSV can directly alter specific central nervous system (CNS) responses 173 by participating in CNS inflammation. An alternative explanation could be the significantly prolonged laryngeal chemo reflex observed in sleeping infants with hRSV bronchiolitis, as compared with those infected with hRSV but that do not develop central apnea. 172 Other extrapulmonary clinical manifestations by hRSV, besides seizures, include recurrent neurological abnormalities. Such abnormalities have been described in two different types: generalized tonic-clonic and partial seizures with altered consciousness and focal motor features or eye deviation (\u25baTable 1). 165, 168 Similar to hRSV encephalopathy, seizures have also been related to the overproduction of cytokines and free radicals. 163, 167 Importantly, hyponatremia can also contribute to seizures. 165, 168 The direct infection of cranial nerves can also result in less common neurological alteration as reported for hRSV infection-induced strabismus in the form of esotropia. 165 Taken together, extrapulmonary manifestations occurring in severe cases of hRSV infections are not isolated cases. Thus, there is an urgent need to evaluate the occurrence of these events in hospitalized children with hRSV bronchiolitis and to study the possible consequences of acute neurological abnormalities due to the infection with this virus. Furthermore, it is imperative to determine whether these extrapulmonary effects are due to direct effects of tissues with hRSV or by inflammatory mediators dispersed from the airways or responding immune cells.",

            "text": "The neurological complications observed upon hRSV infection 167 have encouraged researchers to understand the mechanisms involved in CNS dysfunction. Studies performed in BALB/c mice and Sprague Dawley rats have detected hRSV-RNA and viral proteins in the brain of animals previously infected intranasally with this pathogen. 174 Studies have found that immune cells are associated with hRSV in peripheral blood from hRSV-infected patients. Consistent with this notion, hRSV-infected immune cells would migrate to the CNS by the hematogenous pathway and trespass the blood-brain barrier. 174 An unexpected and important finding regarding the access of hRSV to the CNS was the description that impairment in cognitive function is observed after pulmonary disease was resolved in mice and rats. 174 Indeed, our group recently described that mice and rats infected with hRSV have a deficient performance in tests that evaluate these abilities. hRSV-infected mice performed significantly worse than noninfected mice, both in the Marble Burying (MB) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests, several weeks after viral challenge. 174 The MB test consists in measuring the ability of rodents to dig and hide marbles, which is controlled by hippocampal function. 175 In addition, the MWM evaluates the animal's ability for spatial learning through spatial localization of relevant visual cues that are subsequently processed, consolidated, retained, and then retrieved in the brain to successfully navigate and thereby locate a hidden platform to escape from the water. 176 In both tasks, hRSV-infected animals showed significant alterations in behavioral and learning processes, as compared with control animals. Moreover, electrophysiological assays suggested that impaired cognitive function was due to a failure to efficiently induce long-term potentiation responses in the stratum radiatum in the hippocampus area. Our study supports the previously proposed idea that hRSV can alter CNS function. Accordingly, hRSV has been shown to infect primary neuronal cells in vitro, as well as neural processes innervating the lungs. 148 The association of an exacerbated immune response against hRSV together with hRSV-induced cognitive impairment is supported by the observation that a vaccine that induces protective T cell immunity prevents virus spread into the CNS, as well as neurological alterations caused by infection. 174 A possible explanation is that hRSV may enter the CNS associated with leucocytes or freely, triggering an elevated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that affect normal neuronal function.",
