Microscopic examination of body fluids, fine-needle aspirates of solid organs, and imprints or scrapings of superficial lesions are just a few examples of ways in which infectious agents can be collected and identified morphologically. One of the limitations of cytology is whether the organism occurs in sufficient numbers in circulation or in the tissues or fluids to be identified. To help identify low numbers of organisms, intracellular organisms, and viruses, special stains with affinities for certain physical characteristics of the agents can be applied to the cytology sample. Routine special stains include Gram stain, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and acid-fast stain.",

At the laboratory, the great diversity of infectious microorganisms and their varied biological behaviors can make accurate identification difficult. To help overcome these challenges, many microbiology laboratories now use automated systems that can run a wider range of biological tests and compare the behavior of the sample organism on these tests with a database containing information about the reaction patterns of known pathogens.

Fluorescent antibody and immunoblot assays are performed in commercial laboratories, whereas numerous patient-side rapid ELISA and latex agglutination kits are available for antigen detection. The antigen ELISA assay comprises capturing the antigen of interest by using an antibody immobilized on a solid phase (e.g., a microtiter plate, a membrane, or microparticles) and forming a sandwich with a second antibody that is coupled to an enzyme. Formation of this sandwich occurs only if the corresponding antigen is present in the sample. After binding, the enzyme is catalyzed to give a color reaction. The most widely used ELISA for antigen determination in cats is the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen assay. As with other antigen serology assays, this technique is limited based on the level of antigen load, the location of the antigen (i.e., intracellular or extracellular), and cross-reactivity with other antigens. Recent advances in ELISA assays have been directed toward improving the specificity of the antibody to the organism in question or enhancements in the detection system. Initially, nonspecific, outer surface proteins were used to develop the assay antibodies. This often resulted in cross-reactivity with multiple organisms and false-positive test results. Many tests now use purified, unique proteins to produce highly specific antibodies for the assays. These improved tests have a high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (greater than 95 per cent) and often are discordant with less specific whole-cell IFA tests.3, 4 Additional improvements in ELISA diagnostic assays include enhancements to the conjugate that allow shorter incubation times, superior reaction detection through the use of enzyme stabilizers, and longer conjugate stability and shelf life. Some detection systems have been changed to a non\u2013enzyme-based conjugate for color detection using colloidal gold or colloidal carbon.5\n",

Polymerase enzymes \u201cphotocopy\u201d or amplify minute quantities of genetic material to a volume sufficient for it to be detected.

The extracted DNA then is heat-stressed to cause it to uncoil from its normal double-helix structure and separate into individual strands. The second step involves the addition of the two unique primers that flank each side of the sequence of interest. The primers aid in identification and amplification of the unique DNA sequence in question. When the primer finds the matching section of nucleic acid sequence, this sequence is copied to produce a small fragment of DNA (the amplicon) specific to the organism. This series of steps is repeated 20 to 50 times, with the product of each round serving as additional template for subsequent rounds of amplification. The final result is a logarithmic amplification of the original nucleic acid sequence. Detection of the multiplied nucleic acid sequence is performed during the amplification process with fluorescence emission with each amplification step (real-time PCR), after the completion of all amplification steps with the use of a secondary detection method, or from electrophoretic separation of the final DNA fragment and detection by application of a labeled complimentary nucleic acid probe.",

However, few laboratories have provided the important validation data that are necessary to evaluate and compare methods for diagnostic accuracy. The absence of standardization in testing protocols, primer selection, laboratory contamination control measures, quality control monitoring, and validation methods has led to increasing lab-to-lab variability and poor lot-to-lot reproducibility.

This is further complicated by the fact that PCR cannot distinguish between viable and nonviable organisms, reinforcing the need to establish a comprehensive clinical profile in diagnosis.

For some pathogens, antibodies have been identified that are directed against specific proteins that are present only on the organism when it is alive within the host.4 New assays use these live-pathogen specific peptides instead of whole cell proteins to detect antibodies directed only against those specific peptides. An example of this type of peptide is the recently identified invariable, immunodominant region (IR6) on a variable region of the lipoprotein (VlsE) of Borrelia burgdorferi.6 The IR6 peptide is highly antigenic and stimulates antibody production that rises rapidly during experimental infection and drops rapidly with successful treatment. Several theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including the possibility that the variable region of the VlsE protein is changed rapidly in the organism and older variant molecules are degraded rapidly. This high turnover rate also would ensure that the protein would be rare in dead organisms.7 Therefore acute infections treated immediately showed a rapid rise and drop in antibody against this antigen. It has yet to be determined whether antibody levels in chronic cases will respond similarly, and whether the IR6 is exposed to memory cells over time, resulting in antibody levels that persist following infection and treatment. Vaccination against Borrelia spp. apparently does not induce antibodies to IR6, because the DNA that encodes the IR6 sequence is not present in the laboratory strains of B. burgdorferi used for vaccine production.8\n",
