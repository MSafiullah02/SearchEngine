Early reports in some scientific and public media speculated that the virus had evolved to more effectively transmit between humans. One route of transmission postulated was aerosol transmission, although there was little epidemiological evidence to support this claim. This study investigates the viability of 2 Zaire ebolavirus strains within aerosols at 22\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity over time. The results presented here indicate that there is no difference in virus stability between the 2 strains and that viable virus can be recovered from an aerosol 180 minutes after it is generated.",

            "text": "The largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease to date quietly began in December 2013 with the first cases in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Guinea, West Africa [1] . By August 2014 the disease had become established in large population centers in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The rapid spread of Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) Makona strain over such a wide geographic range led to questions of increased virulence and or human-to-human transmission of the circulating variants of the virus involved in this epidemic. Sequence analysis of early virus isolates collected from patients in Guinea and Sierra Leone was conducted in an attempt to determine whether the Makona strain was changing more rapidly than strains in previous outbreaks. This was critical information because diagnostic assays were dependent on the sequences of the assay reagents matching the sequences of the circulating viruses. These first sequence analysis showed that the West African strains of the virus formed a clade distinct from EBOV sequences collected from previous outbreaks in Central Africa [2] . Further analysis of the new sequences at the nucleotide level revealed a 3% difference among the sequences analyzed, a substitution rate twice that of the rate between outbreaks; in addition, the substitutions were more often nonsynonymous [2, 3] . However, other studies that included more EBOV sequences covering a larger temporal and spatial distribution showed a lower rate of virus evolution, with nucleotide mutations being synonymous or occurring in noncoding regions, similar to what has been observed in previous outbreaks [4, 5] .",

EBOV RNA was used as an internal control for physical loss of aerosol owing to sampling and or settling of the aerosol over the course of the experiment. qRT-PCR was used to monitor the genome copy number of the aerosolized virus suspension as a proxy for the amount of aerosol still in suspension ( Figure 1A ). Virus titration of the sample collected in the all-glass impinger was carried out in 96-well microtiter plates, and the data were used to back calculate the TCID 50 per liter in the drum aerosol ( Figure 1B) . All viability measurements were then normalized to the viral genome copies that remained in suspension ( Figure 1C) . A nonlinear regression model was used to analyze the data for each virus and the slopes were compared. There was no significant difference between the slopes of the TCID 50 per liter of aerosolized virus, regardless of whether the data were normalized to the RNA copy number data; therefore, in both cases the nonlinear regression model was fitted to the slope derived from all of the data. The slope of the nonlinear regression of the nonnormalized data is \u22120.0029, and the slope of the nonlinear regression for the normalized model is \u22120.0016. Using the single-slope regression model generated for the data normalized to genome copy number, the time required for a reduction of 1 log TCID 50 was calculated to be 619 minutes, or 0.43 days. This value is similar to the decay rate reported elsewhere for virus dried on stainless steel or plastic at 27\u00b0C (0.45 days for both substances) [23] . Viable virus was recovered from the aerosol after 180 minutes, at an average concentration of just over 1 \u00d7 10 1 .",

Samples were collected over the course of 3 hours, and the TCID 50 per liter was calculated and plotted to compare the slopes of the viability over time. There was no statistically significant difference in viability between the 2 strains over 3 hours.

Although the starting titer in the aerosol generated for this study may be more biologically relevant, for the purposes of this study a higher starting titer would allow a more accurate assessment of the loss of virus viability over time. A second limitation is that within the drum the aerosol is confined to the volume of the drum. That is necessary for the parameters of this study, but under real-world conditions the virus would be expected to dissipate, thus lowering its concentration over time. In addition, the aerosols were generated using virus in cell culture medium and not a body fluid, as they would be in a natural setting.",

From these data, we calculated a decay rate of 1 Log 10 TCID 50 /619 min , and the virus titer normalized to RNA level, used to reflect the loss of aerosol due to sample withdrawal and settling (C). The limit of detection in this assay is 1.28 log 10 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/L. Slopes were compared for each graph using the GraphPad analysis of covariance function.
