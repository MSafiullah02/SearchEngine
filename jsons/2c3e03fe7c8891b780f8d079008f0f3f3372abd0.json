Leeds) when we were teaching a Chemical Reaction Engineering course at UFSC in Florianopolis. However, I had some K (Knowledge) which helped me to start a research laboratory along with some principles: i) If you don't wish something, you will never get it, ii) Keep eyes open to other areas (cross-fertilization), iii) Accountability (publish research results), iv) In research you can always do what you want; it can take longer because of lack of money, etc. v) Researchers should leave their fingerprint in the lab, vi) Research can't be done with absent people.",

I started my involvement with CO 2 capture in connection with the development of Sorption Enhanced Reaction Processes [30] to shift the equilibrium towards hydrogen production by coupling methane steam reforming with CO 2 sorption on hydrotalcites at high temperature [31] . Later I moved to capture of CO 2 from flue gases using various adsorbents such as 13X zeolites, carbon materials, binderless zeolites in different shapes (monoliths, beads, extrudates) using cyclic adsorption technologies as Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), Vacuum Swing Adsorption (VSA), Temperature Swing adsorption (TSA), Electric Swing Adsorption (ESA). All this work was developed in parallel with modeling and simulation with home-made packages for process simulation [32] . One of the PhD students working in this area was Zhen Liu who returned to ECUST in Shangai, after a sandwich period at LSRE, and built a pilot plant (Fig. 8) to treat flue gas from a coal-fired power plant involving a 2-bed PSA and a 3-bed PSA under the guidance of Prof Yu Jianguo and Ping Li [33, 34] . I was impressed with his achievement when I went to ECUST for his PhD defense.",

The problems in the synthesis of new adsorbents is the scale-up from gr scale to kg scale and increase the productivity by using new reactors such as NETmix reactor [35] . Nevertheless at the end we get powder material and shaping is required to use the adsorbents in fixed bed columns. An example was the 3D printing of composite monolith of 13 X zeolite and activated carbon to be used in ESA operation for CO 2 capture [36] The cost of CO 2 capture is still high and one option is storage. More interesting is the Utilization of CO 2 captured. Still there is a mismatch between the amounts of CO 2 to be captured and the potential use as reactant in current industrial processes. It is important to mention the transformation of CO 2 from geothermal power plant in methanol in Carbon Recycling International (Iceland) following the concept of methanol economy of Nobel Prize George Olah [37] . Another option is the use of adsorption/reaction cyclic process to make Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) from CO 2 . This is the Power-to-Gas concept; in a first step CO 2 from flue gas or other source is adsorbed over hydrotalcites (and concentrated) and in a second step hydrogen from water electrolysis powdered by renewal energy (wind) is fed and methanation reaction occurs producing SNG [38, 39] . This second step is the reactive regeneration of the adsorbent (Fig. 9 ).",

In Kraft processes lignin is removed from wood and the black liquor, after recovery of chemicals, is burned in boilers and therefore pulp mills are net producers of electricity injected in the grid. Typically for a pulp mill processing 1 million ton/year of wood, 250,000 ton/year of lignin are obtained. One may need to increase the capacity of the plant and be limited by the boiler capacity; in such case a fraction of the black liquor can be taken to produce chemicals such as vanillin or syringaldehyde depending on the wood source. In our lab, we developed an integrated process shown in Fig. 10 [40] involving first lignin oxidation followed by membrane separation of low molecular weight compounds from the degraded lignin, which can be sent to the boiler or used to make polyurethane foams. The permeate stream is sent to adsorption columns were a clear separation by families: acids, aldehydes, ketones is achieved (Fig. 11 ) [41] . Proper elution allows enriched fractions of the compounds of interest and finally extraction/crystallization processes lead to the final product (vanillin or syringaldehyde) [42] . There is room here to implement cyclic adsorption processes using some kind of multi-column technology.",

Everyone knows that a good adsorbent should have good adsorption capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, good selectivity, and good thermal, mechanical and chemical stability. However translating these properties in numbers is trickier. Metrics based on Working Capacity(WC), Adsorbent Figure of Merit (AFM), Capture Figure of Merit (CFM) etc.",
