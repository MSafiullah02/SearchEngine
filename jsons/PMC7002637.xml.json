Indeed, its properties of apico-basolateral polarity, cell junctions and in vitro growth rate are well known (Dukes et al. 2012). MDCK cells are also used in studies of viral infections, and more recently in vaccine production (Gregersen et al. 2011). However, little is known about basal expression of genes involved in innate immunity, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, as well as in the secretion of cytokines, and the response to infectious and non-infectious stressors. Moreover, no data are available about the effect of cell passages and aging of confluent monolayers. These gaps may hinder a correct use of these cells for vaccine production and studies on host/pathogen interaction. Owing to the above, the aims of our study were: 1-to evaluate the basal level of expression of pivotal genes in the innate immune response and cell cycle regulation. 2-to evaluate the ability of this cell line to respond to infectious or non-infectious stressors.",

However, after monolayer confluence the concentration of Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs, such as self DNA) in supernatants can increase and cause changes of gene expression; indeed sensing such DNAs leads to activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), respectively (Sok et al. 2018).",

            "text": "In this study, we chose cadmium (Cd2+) as a non-infectious stressor. This heavy metal is widely known for its toxic and carcinogenic effects. Cd2+ toxicity has now been shown in nearly every organ and tissue of the body and the kidney is a critical organ for Cd2+ accumulation and toxicity. Indeed, exposure to Cd2+ has been implicated in renal dysfunction (Bernard 2008). Many studies demonstrated the ability of Cd2+ to modulate the activity of cellular enzymes, to suppress mitochondrial functions, to initiate oxidative stress, and to disrupt calcium homeostasis (Tchounwou et al. 2012; Rusanov et al. 2015). Moreover, in our previous study we demonstrated the ability of this heavy metal to modulate innate immune responses in IPEC-J2 cells as a function of both time and concentration (Razzuoli et al. 2018). Furthermore, Cd2+ exposure has been reported to alter a variety of immune cell functions in terms of both protein expression patterns and immune cell functions (Maret and Moulis 2013). The major mechanism behind Cd2+ toxicity is oxidative stress that induces damages in organs such as kidney, liver, lung, brain and testis. This is due to the inflammatory response caused by Cd-driven tissue damage, including leukocyte activation and recruitment. In particular, Cd2+ induces expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, which underlies the amplification of the inflammatory response (Milnerowicz et al. 2015). Moreover, low levels of Cd2+ may be present in environment contaminants like dust (Tan et al. 2016), plastic and glass (Turner 2019).",

            "text": "To mimic infectious stressors, we chose Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), present in the external wall of Gram-negative bacteria and largely responsible for their toxicity. LPS is recognized by TLR4\u2013co-receptors MD2 and CD14, which recognize the lipid A core of LPS. TLR4 transduces the signal via MyD88 and TRIF adapters to activate NF-\u03baB- and/or IRF3-mediated transcription of genes encoding pivotal molecules of the immune system, including cytokines and chemokines, which mimics major inflammatory response models (Poltorak et al. 1998; Rathinam et al. 2019). Moreover, LPS is of concern since it is a common contaminant of cell cultures. It is an amphipathic molecule which adheres to hydrophobic materials like plastics and glassware. Therefore, cross-contamination between experiments might occur if LPS molecules were not effectively removed. If LPS is introduced into laboratory equipment, its persistence can determine a memory effect provoking inflammatory responses or endotoxin tolerance. The control of LPS contamination is difficult due to its ubiquity in nature, toxicity and stability in solutions (stable depending on pH, ions and surfactants), and even sterilization at temperatures > 180 \u00b0C (Gorbet and Sefton 2005). This can cause contamination or cross-contamination between experiments if LPS is not effectively removed from the system (Schwarz et al. 2014).",

EVA Green RT-qPCR amplification were performed a CFX96\u2122 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, Milano) as previously described (Razzuoli et al. 2014). To evaluate the basal level of expression, PCR-negative samples were given a Ct 39 fictitious value, whereas the positive ones showed Ct values < 38. After LPS or Cd2+ treatment we evaluated the expression of the following genes: IL-8, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TLR1, TLR3, TLR5, TLR9, iNOS, CD14, MyD88, NF-kB/p65, TLR4, MD2, IL-18. To normalize the results, we tested B2M, B-ACT, HPRT1 and GAPDH as possible housekeeping genes by NormFinder algorithm (Peletto et al. 2011). In each sample, the relative expression of the selected genes was calculated using the formula 2\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct, where Ct is short for cycle of threshold and \u0394Ct = Ct (target gene) \u2212 Ct (housekeeping). \u0394Ct values are the mean of three test replicates \u00b1 1 standard deviation and \u0394\u0394Ct = \u0394Ct (different passages, 34th and 40th) \u2212 \u0394Ct (control, 33rd passage).",

Although several studies showed satisfactory results in MDCK cells for these purposes, none of them described their characteristics in terms of both gene expression and involvement in the innate immune response. Therefore, our study focused on the basal levels of protein release and gene expression in this cell line under physiological conditions and after exposure to diverse stressors. Accordingly, we developed a RT-qPCR to evaluate the expression of a selected group of 41 genes coding for molecules of different typology and function. Our results demonstrated the expression of all the genes under study with the exception of IL-4, IL-10, IL-15, IL-17, IL-27 and IFNG; this is in agreement with other studies that reported no expression of these genes in epithelial cells (Bianchi 2007; Groeger and Meyle 2019). We also investigated the basal expression level of TLRs, a family of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), expressed by many cell types, in order to recognize microorganisms (e.g. bacteria, viruses and fungi) and to induce the innate immune response (Velloso et al. 2015). The expression in MDCK of these molecules is in line with the routine use of this cell line: evaluation of the virulence of some bacterial strains, including bacterial penetration, adhesion and cytotoxicity (Chou et al. 2016; Lin et al. 2017). The expression in all samples of p65, one of the major members of the NF-kB protein family, along with MyD88, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-16, implies the ability of this cell line to mount an inflammatory response. This assumption is confirmed by our results. In particular, Cd2+ exposure caused an inflammatory response characterized by up-regulation of genes expression and IL-6 release; this was associated to Cd2+ uptake, in agreement with previous studies conducted on Enterocytes (Razzuoli et al. 2018). MDCK cells showed the ability to absorb low levels of Cd2+, causing an innate immune response, although this cell line is more resistant to Cd2+ exposure, compared with other cell lines like LLC-PK1 (Bonham et al. 2003). Also, a previous study showed that Cd2+ treatments at concentrations equal to or greater than 10 \u03bcM (LLC-PK1) or 25 \u03bcM (MDCK) reduce cell vitality and induce cell death (Bonham et al. 2003).",

In our study, the exposure of MDCK to Cd2+ caused up-regulation of iNOS, TLR1, TLR3, TLR5 and TLR9 gene expression after 3 h of exposure. The genes that are expressed in response to the activation of TLRs encode important proteins at various levels of the innate immune response, including not only cytokines, but also proteins involved in the mechanisms of bacterial killing, such as the inducible nitric oxide synthetase iNOS (Tsutsuki et al. 2012). This response could ease the replication of viral agents in MDCK cells; in this respect, Checconi et al. (2013) demonstrated that the exposure to low levels of cadmium (1\u201350 \u03bcM) increased influenza virus replication in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the exposure to LPS caused in this study a down-regulation of iNOS, CD14, TLR5 and TLR9, which confirms the ability of cells to react to both infectious and non-infectious stressors.",

However, these results differ from data obtained on myeloid cells like human macrophages and monocytes, where LPS causes early pro-inflammatory responses through TLR4/NF-kB signaling (Petes et al. 2018). The absence of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 responses to LPS in MDCK cells could be accounted for by a form of constitutive endotoxin tolerance (Lotz et al. 2006) in these epithelial cells.",

Similar results were obtained in IPEC-J2 (Razzuoli et al. 2018) and Caco-2 cells, in which Hyun et al. (2007) demonstrated the activation of an inflammatory response through the NF-kb pathway.
