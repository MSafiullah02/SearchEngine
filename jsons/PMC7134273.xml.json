Unlike traditional recruitment, e-recruitment makes use of information technology to handle the recruitment processes. Breaugh et al. [1] defined a recruitment model that presents the recruitment process at a macro level with the following activities: Setting recruitment objectives, developing a strategy, performing the recruitment activity and obtaining and evaluating recruitment results. Recruiters compete with each other for candidates (jobseekers suitable for available jobs), while jobseekers compete for jobs; which drives both groups to adopt information technologies at accelerated rates in order to take the strain out of some of the recruitment activities [2\u20137]. \u201cFor most job seekers, the Internet is where the action is\u201d [3, p. 140]. Thus, to get candidates, recruiters need to move swiftly to locate and hire, which may require use of a multitude of information technologies in the process [8, p. 130].",

            "text": "There is evidence in research papers that academic disciplines and stakeholders have varied definitions of e-recruitment. The variety of definitions of e-recruitment is expected because it is part of e-HRM (electronic Human Resource Management) that has in itself different definitions depending on the context [6, p. 26], [9, p. 98]. Studies based on these definitions tend to reveal overlapping and contradictory results due to the overlaps or differences in definitions [9, p. 100]. The differences in definitions, aside from being problematic, is evidence of the variety in conceptualization of e-recruitment. Thus to find a standard definition of e-recruitment, conceptualizations of e-recruitment need to be known. To our knowledge, no research paper in e-recruitment has focused on conceptualization of e-recruitment, however there are studies in other areas of information systems (IS) that have focused on conceptualization [10\u201319]. Most view conceptualization as the formulation of a view about the nature of a phenomenon. The research questions to be answered are:What conceptualizations of e-recruitment exist in literature?How can the conceptualizations be described and explained?\n",

Glaser [22] defines saturation as a state where new data does not bring new properties to the concepts. In an effort to attain completeness a check was done to make sure all conceptualizations were included. Theoretical sampling ended when saturation and completeness was achieved. This is the point at which the number of research articles involved in identifying conceptualizations in e-recruitment were counted. In the end 26 research articles were relevant for identifying and explaining conceptualizations of e-recruitment.",
