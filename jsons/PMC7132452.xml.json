The epidemic has been described as the \u2018gathering storm\u2019 [1] which could create a \u2018next wave\u2019 [2] of infections and deaths in Asia pushing the \u2018continent in peril\u2019 [3] and putting the \u2018economic and social progress in jeopardy\u2019 [4]. Though the prevalence of the disease in Asian regions such as South and Southeast Asia (0.6%) and East Asia (0.1%) is much lower than that in sub-Saharan Africa (6.1%), almost all the countries have detected the virus in their nationals [5]. Yet people who take drugs intravenously and those who sell sex are at the front-line of the population groups hit by the \u2018storm\u2019. The virus has been detected in the majority of injecting drug users in one or more sites of China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam, and among one-tenth or more sex workers in some sites of Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam [6], [7]. The incidence of HIV is rising among low-risk female populations in many countries [8].",

Dwyer et al. observed that although information about devastating impacts of HIV/AIDS in Africa was widely circulated in the region, most countries in Asia took no initiative to adopt the measures proven to be effective in controlling the epidemic [9]. There are notable disagreements about the extent, prospect, and prevention of the disease. At the first hand, the control of AIDS epidemics looks simple, as Thailand has shown that the disease can be contained provided that the leaders are committed and focused interventions are put in place [10]. But many other countries have done little to reach the people who are the first to face the \u2018storm\u2019. A 2003 review showed that only a small fraction of at-risk populations such as injecting drug users, sex workers, and migrants had been reached with the basic prevention services [11]. Not much was changed by 2005 [5]. Even Thailand was no exception given that only a few drug injectors and homosexuals were receiving some outreach services [11].",

            "text": "The analysis is guided by the social constructionist approach which assumes that the diseases are biological phenomena but they carry socially constructed meaning. Widespread stigma and discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS arise partly from the existing negative public attitude towards these people [12]. The negative public image of HIV/AIDS and people carrying the virus is not only associated with the nature of the disease but also with the socially constructed meaning or understanding about the risk factors. The extent of stigma varies according to modes of transmission or behaviours perceived to be responsible for the infection and the pre-existing characteristics of the at-risk groups. Many different social institutions contribute to the construction of specific public images of the target populations. The people and places at risk of contracting a disease are identified by the epidemiological studies but they do not necessarily become comprehensible to the masses. The public, the media, and the policy-makers begin to develop certain images about the disease and the at-risk people. According to Schneider and Ingram [13], \u2018officials develop maps of target populations based on both the stereotypes they themselves hold and those they believe to prevail among the segments of the public likely to become important to them.\u2019 Formulation and shifts in policy for a particular group, subpopulation, or community depend on how they are viewed by policy-makers. Gauri and Liberman contend that where social institutions divide the population groups deeply, elites and common people perceive AIDS to be a disease of other people outside their community and who are unlikely to mingle with them [14]. When responsible authorities take \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018they\u2019 approach by prejudicially linking the disease with specific sections of the populations, AIDS policies remain misguided and fragmented. To illustrate, despite very similar socio-demographic set-ups, response to AIDS were very different in Brazil and South Africa; unlike Brazil where AIDS was considered a general threat for the entire population, AIDS was linked in South Africa with the racial issues and AIDS policy was marred with racial divisions [14].",

This has even tied the hands of the United Nations (UN) agencies which are looked for leading the global efforts to fight this pandemic. The Political Declaration adopted on 15 June 2006 by the UN General Assembly mentioned the term \u2018vulnerable groups\u2019 five times but nowhere specified what they include [15]. This was aimed at avoiding the acknowledgment of the existence of vulnerable groups such as injecting drug users and sex workers. Yet much of the international comments on AIDS denial refer to South Africa where the President Thabo Mbeki questioned the prevailing mainstream views on HIV/AIDS, and set up the Presidential AIDS Advisory Panel [16], [17], [18]. Inclusion of the so-called dissident scientists in the panel was the most controversial aspect of his initiative and the major cause for severe criticism against him. Refuting the established biomedical explanations, Mbeki raised doubts about the role of sexual behaviours in driving the epidemic, attributed poverty as a cause for widespread AIDS deaths in Africa, and expressed skepticism to the relevance of antiretroviral therapy. He was, therefore, branded as a \u2018denialist\u2019 and was even considered responsible for \u2018genocide\u2019 for the deaths due to AIDS in his country [18].",

There is, however, little clarity as to what the AIDS denial means in the Asian contexts. Mention of this term in one or the other context or to accuse governments [19], [20] is not helpful to understand the full picture of the denial in this region.

To illustrate the illusion of moral order, it is sufficient to quote the then Indian Health Minister:\u2018Ours is a moral society. While tackling AIDS you [cannot] say you lead licentious lives because [you can use] condoms. I don\u2019t think that should be the message.\u2019 [27]\n",

When the disease began to appear among the local populations of Asia, the virus was initially identified among people who were traditionally considered deviants or immoral. In India, a female sex worker from Chennai was the first local person identified with HIV. Initial outbreaks of HIV in this country occurred among injecting drug users in Manipur, a northeastern state bordering on Myanmar [28] and female sex workers in Mumbai [7]. Likewise, in Indonesia, initial cases of HIV infections were found in costal areas frequented by Thai fishermen [29]. The first major outbreaks of HIV in China were limited to the injecting drug users mostly from the ethnic minorities in Yunnan province [30], [31]. This might have created a false hope that the mainstreams of the society would be insulated from the epidemic.",

Though the country soon took bold steps to publicise the statistics and to institute the much-admired condom-promotion campaign [33], many other countries in the region continued to show high sensitivity towards the statistics on HIV/AIDS and the most-at-risk groups. This is one of the reasons behind limited availability and quality of the statistics on the at-risk groups such as injecting drug users, sex workers and their clients, and men who have sex with men in the region [34], [35], [36]. Attitude of authorities in several countries of this region is probably reflected in the UN Theme Group's observation about the local governments in China:Many local governments do not want to know, or let others know about HIV/AIDS in their area for fear that it will reflect poorly on the locality and its officials. Local governments sometimes suppress information and sometimes even actively oppose research on HIV/AIDS. [37]\n",

On several occasions, internal and external agencies have seriously doubted one another's estimates. Generally, India and China kept questioning the validity of the HIV/AIDS estimates and relevance of the prevention programs prescribed by the international institutions and Western health experts. In 1996, Indian officials disagreed with the UN estimate of 3 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the country, and the media even suspected that the \u2018figures were being inflated by the West to pressure India into accepting vaccine trial and other research on HIV infected people\u2019 [38]. A doctor familiar with the AIDS situation in India, however, warned that \u2018Denial, complacency, and blaming others for the epidemic are the main reasons why HIV has spread so successfully\u2019 in the country [19]. Similar disagreements erupted in 2004 when Richard Feachman, the Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria warned that India had the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world, surpassing South Africa. He remarked, \u2018I don\u2019t believe in official statistics. India is already in [the] first place\u2019 [39]. His arguments were refuted by several senior government officials of India citing that these two countries were not comparable and the gap in HIV prevalence levels were large [40]. Likewise, on 13 September 2003, The Lancet published a news report entitled \u2018Human rights organization blasts China over HIV/AIDS cover-up.\u2019 Human Rights Watch accused Chinese government of being \u2018in denial\u2019 over scale of HIV/AIDS epidemic. In this report, Asian division director of Human Rights Watch, a New York based organization, was quoted as commenting: \u2018The Chinese government has been in denial about the problem for many years\u2019, and \u2018Beijing's failure to act decisively in the AIDS epidemic continues to cost lives and cause incalculable suffering to those living with the virus\u2019 [20].",

They maintained that the absence of any comment about syphilis in Sanskrit works would illustrate the absence of this disease in this region. They noted: \u2018The disease is first mentioned in Bhabaprakasa under the name of Feringhi Roga (Portuguese Disease) and mercurial preparations are recommended its treatment\u2019 [41]. The term Feringhi was used in many countries of Asia not only to refer to Portuguese but any European. In Nepal, for example, local name of syphilis is Viringi and it seems probable that the name was coined to identify the disease with the Feringhi. Medical history also indicates that incidence of venereal diseases was probably higher among Europeans than Asians. According to the 1926 Annual Report of the Public Health Commissioner with the Government of India, rates of hospital admissions for treatment of venereal diseases of British troops (62.1 per 1000) was four times higher than that of Indian troops (15.7 per 1000) [41].",

This pattern of thought is sometimes referred, particularly in the East or Southeast Asia, as the Asian values.

A relevant example is the great population debate \u2013 evolved in the 1950s \u2013 about the role of aggressive family planning programs versus role of development for population control in the developing countries [43], [44]. In the 1970s, developing countries questioned the Western policy of the uni-focal family planning programs to control population in the Third World countries.

            "text": "The construction of public impression about AIDS and the at-risk groups began with its initial epidemiological mystery. The disease remained mysterious for some years and societies developed various metaphors reflecting fear, stigma and moralistic misapprehensions [45]. Various perceptions about AIDS and at-risk groups evolved in the West permeated Asia well before the disease arrived. In the US, AIDS was initially found among gays and hence characterized as a \u2018gay plague\u2019 [46]. This prompted the Asian policy-makers to dismiss the potential challenge of this epidemic assuming that homosexuality was absent in Asia. In the 1980s, AIDS cases detected in Asia were mostly among foreigners, overseas returnees, and female sex workers. Until the early 1990s, AIDS in Asia was generally interpreted as the foreigner's disease, particularly Westerner's disease, associated with homosexuality and prostitution. For example, in 1990, a journalist observed that the \u2018Indian government's perception that \u201cforeigners\u201d are the principal carriers of HIV does not seem to have changed in recent years\u2019 [47]. He added, \u2018most laws proposed to check the spread of AIDS are aimed at non-nationals\u2019 [47]. Similar was the situation in Thailand where AIDS was initially perceived as \u2018a foreign disease, carried by foreigners and brought from foreign lands\u2019, and later as \u2018a disease of homosexuals\u2019 and then as \u2018a disease of intravenous drug users\u2019 [48]. In the Philippines, AIDS was mainly identified with the prostitutes and lower class gays who had contact with foreigners. Even the upper class gays were arguing that \u2018low class gay people should be rounded up for AIDS testing since they\u2019re the only ones now who go around with the foreigners\u2019 [49]. In some instances, people from high prevalence neighbouring regions were also blamed and cautioned. For example, when Taiwan started to recruit foreign labourers in 1991 to make up its labour shortage, the labourers from South and Southeast Asia were characterized as the highest risk category who would pass HIV to innocent locals [50]. It has been taking a long time to overcome the misinterpretation that AIDS is simply a disease of bad people.",

So, these groups have been blamed for spreading the disease and considered to be personally accountable for the infections. Major messages directed to the negatively viewed powerless groups are that \u2018they are bad people whose behaviour constitute a problem for others,\u2019 and that \u2018they can expect to be punished unless they change their behaviour or avoid contact with the government\u2019 [13]. The negatively viewed powerless at-risk groups mostly included injecting drug users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and immigrants. In Japan, as the official medical care system excludes undocumented foreign nationals, the immigrants are reluctant to take HIV test and to seek medical care for the fear of deportation [51]. Burmese migrants in Thailand, especially those who lack work permit, also avoid visiting health facilities because of the fear of deportation [52]. On 24 May 2006, a Thai daily, The Nation, reported that HIV prevalence among migrants was twice the prevalence in pregnant women, and hence the local public health experts were pointing out migrants as emerging vectors of HIV.",

In Yunnan, China, for example, drug users carry stigma and are denied participation in the community activities and state sponsored services irrespective of their HIV status [55]. A study from six Asian countries identified that the tendency to blame, stigmatize, and discriminate the people vulnerable to, or living with, HIV is realised more clearly in interpersonal contexts such as health facilities but this is grounded in cultural, religious, institutional, and structural frameworks [56]. In some instances, governments use strong negative terms such as social evils to described these people and emphasize punishment rather than support and care [57], [58]. Comparatively, AIDS carries more stigma than do other killer diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and tuberculosis because AIDS is still seen as the consequence of one's own carelessness [59].",

There are some variations in the images of AIDS and at-risk groups across the regions but they are not merely local products; rather they have been shaped by the global and historical institutions as well. The echo has been felt up to the UN General Assemblies at the international level and down to the individuals at the micro-level. Interestingly, no one in Asia has taken views as extreme as the South African president Mbeki, but there are many instances of disagreements, doubts, and denials that have been affecting the people directly exposed to the pandemic. While indifference, doubts, and blame underpin inaction or slow action in some instances, they have led to adopt negative policies in the other instances.",

Strategies can vary among the nations depending on their socio-cultural context and economic and technical ability. A general approach is to tackle pre-existing background stigma towards these vulnerable groups by promoting solidarity and intensifying advocacy. This helps reduce the long-held tendency to see AIDS as a disease of some careless people. The efforts of local and international networks of people with HIV have been showing some impacts but these institutions should have more than ceremonial recognition. Further work is required to improve surveillance, research, and analysis and to better understand the extent and prospect of the epidemics and to show the implications to the society of the continued inactions. Such work should be supplemented by conceptual debate on how broader social contexts, not only individual desires, underpin the risk behaviours.",
