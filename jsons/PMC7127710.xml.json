Coronaviruses (CoVs) are found in a wide range of animal species including cat, dog, pig, rabbit, cattle, mouse, rat, chicken, pheasant, turkey, whale, as well as humans. Before the SARS epidemic, the only recognized coronaviruses causing respiratory tract infection in humans were HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. In 2003, a previously unrecognized CoV was detected from SARS patients,8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and was confirmed to be the causative agent for SARS; it became known as SARS-CoV. Retrospective serologic surveys suggested that cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV or its variants from various animal species to humans might have occurred frequently in the wet market, as a high seroprevalence was detected among animal handlers who had no notable SARS-like illnesses.16\n",

In 2005, CoVs that are similar to SARS-CoV were found in horseshoe bats by 2 independent research teams.19, 20 These bat SARS-like CoVs share 88% to 92% sequence homology with human or civet isolates, but with key differences found in the region encoding spike (S) protein that is critical in determining host range and tissue tropism.21 The data suggest that bats could be a natural reservoir of a close ancestor of SARS-CoV, and that the CoVs seem to have used an entirely new receptor when they crossed species from bats to palm civets and humans.",

The high morbidity of SARS was highlighted by the observation that, even when there was only 12% of total lung field involved by consolidation on chest radiographs, 50% of patients would require supplemental oxygen to maintain satisfactory oxygenation greater than 90%,55 whereas about 20% of patients would progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating invasive ventilatory support.34 Peiris and colleagues35 showed a progressive decrease in rates of viral shedding from nasophargynx, stool, and urine from day 10 to day 21 after symptom onset in 20 patients who had serial measurements with reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Thus, clinical worsening during phase II was most likely the result of immune-mediated lung injury as a result of an overexuberant host response and could not be explained by uncontrolled viral replication.35\n",

DC-SIGN is expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells including those found in skin, lungs, intestine, rectum, cervix, placenta, and lymph node. However, the binding of SARS-CoV to DC-SIGN does not lead to entry of viruses into dendritic cells; instead it facilities the transfer of viruses to other susceptible cells. In this way, the dendritic cells play an important role in virus dissemination within the infected host.73, 74, 75 L-SIGN (CD209L or DC-SIGNR) is a homolog of DC-SIGN, which is expressed in liver, lymph node, and placenta.

First, in addition to being the host receptor mediating the entry of SARS-CoV, the ACE2 probably contributes to the diffuse alveolar damage. ACE2 is a negative regulator of the local renin-angiotensin system, where its imbalance leads to the development of diffuse alveolar damage. Data from animal studies suggest that the diffuse alveolar damage seen in SARS is mediated by the S protein-ACE2-renin-angiotensin pathway.84, 85 The second direct injury mechanism is by the induction of apoptosis. The SARS-CoV\u2013encoded 3a and 7a proteins have been shown to be a strong inducer of apoptosis in cell lines derived from different organs including lungs, kidneys, and liver.86, 87, 88\n",

Nevertheless, complications such as disseminated fungal disease132 and avascular necrosis of bone have been reported following prolonged corticosteroid therapy.133 With the rescue pulsed MP approach, avascular necrosis of bone was found in 12 (4.7%) patients after screening 254 using magnetic resonance imaging. The risk of avascular necrosis was 0.6% for patients receiving less than 3 g, and was 13% for those receiving more than 3 g prednisolone\u2013equivalent dose.134 A randomized placebo-controlled study conducted at PWH, HK showed that plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations in the second and third weeks of illness were higher in patients given initial hydrocortisone (n = 10) than in those given normal saline (n = 7) during phase I of the clinical course of illness.135 Despite the small sample size, the data suggest that pulsed MP given in the earlier phase might prolong viremia and thus it should only be given during the later phase for rescue purposes. Carefully designed clinical trials with larger sample sizes are required to determine the optimal timing and dosage of systemic steroid in the treatment of possibly immune-mediated lung injury in SARS.",

However, this approach requires the production of a large amount of infectious virus in a biosafety level 3 containment facility, which is not widely available among vaccine manufacturers. Because the S protein of SARS-CoV is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, it is a priority target for the development of subunit vaccines. Full-length S protein delivered in the form of DNA vaccine, or expressed in attenuated vaccinia virus or recombinant baculovirus systems, have been to shown to induce T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, and have been found to be protective in challenge studies.124, 126, 164, 165 However, there are concerns about using full-length S protein as a vaccine, because harmful immune responses causing liver damage in vaccinated animals have been reported.166 The possibility of enhanced disease, as observed in vaccinated cats on infection with feline infectious peritonitis virus, is also a concern.167, 168 Theoretically, antibodies present at low concentrations may form complexes with virions, and be taken up by macrophage via the Fc receptors expressed on its surface. This process enhances virus dissemination and may lead to adverse outcomes. Vaccines based on a partial S protein or other structural proteins of SARS-CoV have been explored. The greatest challenge to sustainable vaccine development is that SARS-CoV has disappeared from humans, and antigenic changes of the re-emergent strain, if it ever occurs, remain unknown.",

HCWs are particularly vulnerable to SARS as the viral loads of SARS-CoV in patients increase to peak levels during the second week after patients are hospitalized.35, 169 Because SARS has the potential to be converted from droplet to airborne transmission, HCWs should use adequate respiratory protection, in addition to strict contact and droplet precautions, when managing patients with SARS. Because there is currently no proven effective treatment of SARS, early recognition, isolation, and stringent infection control measures are the key to controlling this highly contagious disease. Isolation facilities, strict droplet and contact precautions (hand hygiene, gown, gloves, N95 masks, eye protection) for HCWs managing patients with SARS, avoidance of using jet nebulizers on general wards,1, 27, 52 contact tracing, and quarantine isolation for close contacts are important measures in controlling the spread of the infection in hospitals and the community.",
