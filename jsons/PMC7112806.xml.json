            "text": "Porcine parvovirus (PPV) genome, a single-stranded DNA comprising about 5000 nucleotides, contains two large open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encoding the non-structural (NS) proteins is highly conserved among the parvoviruses and the other ORF encoding capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) may vary between some strains of PPV. VP1 and VP2 are proteins translated in the same frame but from different start codons and VP3 is a product of VP2 proteolytic cleavage (Molitor et al., 1983, R\u00e1nz et al., 1989, Bergeron et al., 1993). PPV is considered an important cause of reproductive failure in swine. Embryonic death and resorption, mummified foetuses and stillbirth, as a result of prolonged farrowing intervals, are typical clinical signs of PPV-induced reproductive failure (Mengeling et al., 2000). PPV occurs worldwide with variable reported prevalence rates (Maldonado et al., 2005). The prerequisite for controlling the disease is rapid and accurate identification of this organism.",

PPV was commonly found in pigs with PMWS (Woodbine et al., 2007). Several researchers reported that PCV1, PCV2 and PRV could also reproduce symptoms typical of PMWS (Rodriguez et al., 1999, Rovira et al., 2002, Kim and Chae, 2003, Woodbine et al., 2007). Thus, the development of a simple and rapid diagnostic tool that could detect PPV and differentiate it from PCV1, PCV2 and PRV in the same samples would be of significance for epidemiological surveillance and prediction of the severity of PMWS outbreaks in swine herds.",

Adding SYBR Green I to LAMP reactions can increase the ease and sensitivity of detection by the naked eye (Iwamoto et al., 2003).",

The lack of cross reaction observed with CPV, B19V, PCV1, PCV2, PRV and host-derived DNA indicates that PPV LAMP system may be specific in addition to high sensitivity. In the present study, the optimal tissues for PPV LAMP are probably the blood, lymph node, lung, kidney, heart, duodenum and jejunum because these gave a 100% detection rate in LAMP assay. Furthermore, blood is the preferable sample during the early stage of infection, which may have a higher predictive value of detecting PPV infection during disease surveillance screening.",
