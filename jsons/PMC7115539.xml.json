Mucosal vaccines are an alternative to injectable vaccines, because it is e.g. increasingly more difficult to incorporate new injectable vaccines into the existing paediatric vaccination programmes. In addition, mucosally delivered vaccines activate the mucosal immune system to elicit protective secretory IgA antibodies and cellular immunity. This is relevant for protection against viruses, bacteria and parasites that enter the body through mucosal surfaces and cause diseases of the intestinal, respiratory and genital tracts.",

Both soluble and particle-associated proteins given intranasally can, through uptake by the nasopharynx-associated lymphoreticular tissue (NALT), elicit local and distal mucosal as well as systemic immune responses [3]. Therefore, oral or nasal immunisation may also be useful against pathogens that enter the body through routes other than mucosa. Attenuated strains of bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella typhi, Mycobacterium bovis and Bordetella pertussis are being developed as vectors for mucosal immunisation, but suffer from the disadvantage that they tend to disseminate in the body [3] and can be unsafe in immuno-compromised persons.",

Several bacterial or viral antigens have been expressed in L. lactis for use in oral and intranasal immunisations [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The advantage in relation to the potency of the elicited immune response of anchoring the antigens to the cell wall of the producing L. lactis cells as opposed to intracellular expression has been demonstrated by others [9], [10], [12], [13], [14].

Although L. lactis is an innocuous bacterium, its widespread use as a genetically modified strain in vaccinations, especially mucosal vaccinations, may cause undesirable shedding of recombinant DNA into the environment with the attendant risk of transfer to other organisms. In order to eliminate this risk we developed a non-genetically modified L. lactis support that allows highly efficient binding of proteins that are fused to a lactococcal peptidoglycan binding domain, the protein anchor (PA). For this purpose, L. lactis cells are pre-treated with an acid that removes surface components [15], leaving non-living particles that we termed Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) [16], [17]. The pre-treated and neutralized GEM particles are used to bind the antigen-PA fusion that was produced by another source (in trans binding). In this way, the antigen can be presented to the immune system as a bacterial particle that does not contain the recombinant DNA encoding the antigen.",

Instead it had the signal \u2013 and pro-sequence [nucleotides 1206\u20131766 in Ref. [18]] of the lactococcal cell wall-associated proteinase PrtP at the N-terminus for efficient secretion, together with a C-terminal anchor sequence (PA) derived from the L. lactis cell-wall hydrolase AcmA [corresponding to nucleotides 733\u20131488 in Ref. [24]]. The corresponding MSA2 fusion protein MSA2-PA is termed MSA2-nCov for reasons of clarity. MSA2-nCov is attached non-covalently to the cell wall of the producer cells through the protein anchor [15], and is also secreted into the culture medium after which it can be rebound non-covalently to lactococcal GEM particles [15], [16], [17]. Plasmid pNG3043 (Fig. 1) expressed the same 223-aa fragment of MSA2 as in pNG3041, with the signal and pro-sequence of PrtP at the N-terminus, but with a cell-wall spanning and covalent anchoring sequence of PrtP, cP, at its C-terminus [corresponding to nucleotides 6539\u20136914 in Ref. [18]]. This MSA2 fusion protein MSA2-cP is termed MSA2-Cov. The plasmids pNZ8048 (negative control), pNG3041 and pNG3043 were used to transform L. lactis-NZ9000, which has the nisRK genes in the chromosome needed for the nisin-induced activation of PnisA\n[23], by electroporation [26].",

One rabbit obtained three intramuscular (i.m.) immunisations with L. lactis(MSA2-Cov) as a positive control (totally 24 \u03bcg MSA2-Cov). Immunofluorescence reactivity against the surface of P. falciparum merozoites was used to assay antibodies in sera and faecal extracts, as this measures antibodies reacting with near-native MSA2 protein (see Section 2). The IFA results of the immunised rabbits are summarised in Table 1. A single immunisation with L. lactis(MSA2-Cov) administered i.m., nasally or orally did not yield anti-MSA2 serum antibodies detectable by IFA. A further boosting immunisation was needed in all cases to detect antibodies. It is apparent that the positive control, i.m. immunisation with L. lactis(MSA2-Cov), led to good serum antibody titres. The titres waned 15 weeks after the third injection but could be boosted to the original levels by a fourth i.m. injection. Levels of IgG antibodies after three immunisations, as measured with an FITC-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody against rabbit \u03b3 chains, were one order of magnitude less but still indicate that IgG antibodies constitute the major portion of the antibody response against MSA2-Cov expressed on cells of L. lactis-pNG3043(MSA2-Cov) after i.m. immunisation.",

The staining bands in the lanes indicate that L. lactis proteins present at that position in the SDS-PAA gel reacted with the indicated rabbit antiserum. A pronounced anti-L. lactis protein response was observed after 2 or 3 i.m. administrations of the live recombinant L. lactis vaccine (Fig. 5A). This response was clearly reduced after oral delivery of the vaccine (Fig. 5B). The anti-L. lactis response was even more minimized in the rabbit orally immunised with the GEM particle vaccine (Fig. 5C). It is clear from these results that mucosal delivery reduces the anti-carrier response and that the L. lactis GEM particles generate less anti-carrier antibody responses than the live recombinant L. lactis cells.",

It was also our aim to evaluate the feasibility of a novel bacterial antigen display system that avoids the use of recombinant DNA in the vaccine. For this purpose, we compared MSA2 vaccines based on a live recombinant L. lactis surface display system that exploits the commonly used covalent LPXTG-type anchoring cassette [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [27], [28], with a non-living non-genetically modified L. lactis surface display system, the GEM particles. The GEM particles can be loaded with the antigen when the latter is fused to the non-covalent cell wall binding domain (PA) of the lactococcal protein AcmA. Others have already demonstrated that non-living recombinant lactococci are as efficient as live L. lactis cells in eliciting antibody responses in mucosal immunizations [7]. The AcmA cell wall binding domain PA has been used to display antigens on live recombinant [27], [28] or non-recombinant live L. lactis cells [29]. Here we used acid pre-treated L. lactis cells, which we termed GEM particles [16], for antigen delivery because this pre-treatment enhances the binding capacity for PA fusion proteins [15], [16], [17]. Moreover, the use of GEM particles in vaccines prevents the dissemination of recombinant DNA in the environment. The results of the oral immunisations confirm that non-living L. lactis GEM particles are equally efficient in eliciting antigen-specific antibody responses as living L. lactis cells. Consequently, the present results show that L. lactis GEM particles, which consist of peptidoglycan largely devoid of lipotechoic acid and lacking DNA [16], known immunostimulants [30], [31], can also efficiently stimulate antigen presenting cells without the use of additional adjuvants. In addition, GEM particles elicit less anti-carrier response than live L. lactis cells. Not requiring additional adjuvant and a minimal anti-carrier response would be desirable characteristics for any vaccine to be used in human vaccinations. Further investigations are warranted to reveal the mechanism of immune stimulation.",

            "text": "Our results with the recombinant L. lactis delivery system suggest that oral immunisation leads to higher levels of serum antibodies than the corresponding nasal immunisation procedure employed. A similar observation was made by Pei et al. [13] in immunisations with L. lactis expressing the SARS-coronavirus nucleocapsid protein. Also other investigators observed significant systemic immune responses after oral immunisations with recombinant lactococci [7], [8], [9], [10] and in some cases protection against a lethal challenge was obtained [7], [10], [11]. Protection against infection with P. falciparum can not be evaluated in a challenge model using non-primate animals. The anti-MSA2 serum antibodies generated in the present study in the oral immunisations with both delivery formats, react with near-native antigen on merozoites, as evidenced by the IFA studies on intact merozoites. Reaction of the antibodies with merozoite surfaces is related to their biological efficacy, i.e. the inhibition of red cell invasion. In addition, the demonstration of systemic IgG antibodies whose levels can be boosted implies that MSA2-specific Th cells are activated through mucosal immunisation. The detection of MSA2-specific IgA antibodies in the extracts from faecal pellets of rabbits immunised orally is consistent with the observation of others [7], [10], [11], [32], [33]. Therefore, the findings suggest that foreign proteins expressed in L. lactis can also be used in oral vaccination procedures to elicit protective secretory antibodies in the gut.",

Intramuscular immunisation with synthetic peptide polymers based on MSA2 B-cell epitopes elicited high-titre antibodies against the immunising peptide, which reacted only poorly with near-native MSA2 on merozoites [36]. While very high titres (10\u22126) of antibodies reacting with near-native MSA2 is achievable in animals with recombinant MSA2 in intramuscular immunisations, this required the use of Freund's adjuvant, which is not acceptable for human use [25]. Adjuvants with fewer side effects that have been tried on humans with recombinant MSA2, have yielded poorer antibody titres [37]. Therefore oral immunisation with L. lactis MSA2 display formats is a promising method of generating systemic anti-MSA2 antibodies in man for protection against malaria.",

The apparent advantages of the GEM approach are: (i) it avoids the need for introducing recombinant cells or additional adjuvants into vaccine recipients; (ii) it elicits a weaker immune response against the vector, thereby increasing safety and possibly permitting a greater number of immunisations than feasible with intact L. lactis; (iii) the process more easily permits immunisation with different combinations of antigens on the same particle [16]. Experiments are presently in progress to determine whether proteins absorbed on the GEM particles are able to induce antigen-specific systemic Tc cells, which could further widen the use of the GEM particles in vaccine preparations.",
