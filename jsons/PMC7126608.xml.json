            "text": "The replication of viral RNA, for both eucaryotic and procaryotic plus-strand RNA viruses, initiates with the production of minus-strand RNA. This process involves recognition of cis-acting elements within the viral genome by the replication machinery. Although many of these elements include sequences and/or structures that reside in the 3\u2032 non-translated regions (NTR) of viral RNAs,1., 2., 3. some cis-acting elements have been found to reside upstream and in the 5\u2032 NTR.4 In addition, a long-distance interaction between elements near the 3\u2032 terminus and 1200 nt upstream has been shown to be important for bacteriophage Q\u03b2 replication minus-strand RNA synthesis in vitro.5 Analyses of the roles of cis-acting elements in the synthesis of minus-strand RNA are complicated because 3\u2032-terminal sequences may be required for other aspects of virus replication such as assembly, translation and/or RNA stabilization.6., 7., 8., 9., 10., 11., 12., 13.\n",

The genome (Figure 1(A)) has an 84 nt 5\u2032 NTR, five open reading frames (ORFs) and a 72 nt 3\u2032 NTR.41., 42. ORF1 encodes the viral replicase, which is the only viral protein absolutely required for replication. The overlapping ORFs 2\u20134, collectively called the triple gene block, encode for proteins required for viral cell-to-cell and long-distance movement.43., 44., 45. ORF 5 encodes the coat protein, which is also required for viral movement.45., 46., 47. Our previous studies have shown that there are sequence and structural elements present in the 5\u2032 NTR of PVX RNA that affect genomic and subgenomic (sgRNA) plus-strand RNA accumulation.48., 49., 50. These analyses revealed that although the plus-strand RNA accumulation was affected by mutations in the 5\u2032 NTR, there was no significant effect on minus-strand RNA accumulation. Both local elements upstream of the sgRNAs, as well as long-distance interactions with complementary sequence at the terminus, are important for PVX plus-strand RNA accumulation. None of these elements in the 5\u2032 NTR or upstream of the sgRNAs affected PVX minus-strand RNA accumulation. In contrast, Sriskanda et al.37 showed that deletion of 38 nt in the 3\u2032 NTR of PVX RNA affected minus-strand RNA accumulation. Moreover, an eight nucleotide U-rich element within this region was shown to be important for host protein binding and replication.",

We have identified multiple sequence elements throughout the 3\u2032 NTR that were required for minus-strand RNA accumulation, as well as a short region near the 3\u2032 terminus that was dispensable. In contrast, only one stem-loop structure was critical for RNA accumulation.

The thermodynamic energy dot plot shown in Figure 2(A) represents all secondary structures for the 250 nt sequence within 10% of the minimal energy. The triangle below the diagonal represents the most optimal folding of the minimum energy structure, with the rows of dots corresponding to nucleotide positions involved in pairing and the gaps within the rows indicating internal loops or bulges. The triangle above the diagonal represents sub-optimal foldings within 4 kcal (1 cal=4.184 J) of minimum free energy of the optimal folding. The dark dots represent optimal pairings and alternative folding patterns are represented by progressively lighter dots, with the lightest dots representing the least-favored pairing. Regions that are scattered with differently shaded dots exhibit multiple folding possibilities. The 3\u2032 NTR (nucleotides 6364\u20136435 plus 17 A residues) of PVX RNA was predicted to contain three stem-loop structures, denoted SL1, SL2 and SL3 in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction (Figure 2(A) and (B)). As seen in Figure 2(A), SL3 was strongly predicted, but SL1 had some scatter near the base of the stem. The region containing SL2 and the region between SL2 and SL3 contained considerable scatter, suggesting multiple pairing possibilities. Similar structures were obtained when foldings were done with additional residues from the SpeI site. The secondary structure predicted by STAR program strongly supported the existence of SL3. There was no stable pseudoknot predicted in the 3\u2032 region of PVX RNA.",

Samples were analyzed using Rnase T1 and Rnase V1 to detect unpaired G residues and base-paired or stacked helical regions, respectively. Reaction conditions for both the chemical modification and the RNase digestion were optimized such that less than one nucleotide per RNA molecule was modified. The extent of modification and cleavage was analyzed by primer extension of the products and subsequent gel electrophoresis. A particular nucleotide was considered reactive if the intensity of the extended product signal was stronger in the modified (+) lane than that in the unmodified (\u2212) lane. Transcripts derived from clone p10, containing 185 nt of the PVX RNA 3\u2032 region were used for the enzymatic cleavage experiments and full-length PVX transcripts derived from clone pMON8453 were utilized for the chemical modification experiments. Comparison of these transcripts and viral RNA resulted in similar modification patterns (data not shown).",

Autoradiographs corresponding to some of these data are shown in Figure 3, Figure 4\n. RNase V1 cleaved many of the nucleotides in the stem of SL1 and none was reactive to DMS, indicating base-pairing or stacking in this region. Lack of modification in the 3\u2032 end of the lower region of SL1 was due to protection by primers used in the reverse transcription reactions. Exceptions to the predicted pairing were indicated by susceptibility of G6415 to Rnase T1 (Figure 2, Figure 4) and U6412 to CMCT (Figure 3(B)). Although the nucleotides in the predicted mismatch were not modified by DMS, it was not susceptible to RNase V1. The terminal loop residue G6423 was cleaved by RNase T1, suggesting that it was not paired, but none of the other terminal loop residues was accessible to DMS or CMCT. In contrast, all of the loop residues were accessible to RNase V1. Thus, it appears that the upper stem region of SL1 may be base-paired as predicted, and that the terminal loop residues of SL1 may be stacked or be involved in pairing with nucleotides located elsewhere. The lower region of the predicted stem region appears to be more flexible and may form alternative structures, which is consistent with the thermodynamic energy dot plot (Figure 2(A)).",

Similarly, G6401 in this loop had strong reaction with Rnase T1 (Figure 4(A)). In contrast, U6394\u201396 exhibited low-level modification by CMCT, as seen in Figure 3(B). Low reactivity of A6392 to DMS (Figure 3(A)) and G6411 to RNase T1 (Figure 4(A)), combined with weak or absent reactivity of some loop residues, may indicate that alternative structures can form. Since SL1 is predicted to be immediately adjacent to predicted SL2, it is possible that these two stems are co-axially stacked. The low level of modification of the residue G6411 at the base of SL2, and CMCT reaction of the contiguous U6412 at the base of SL1 (Figure 4, Figure 3, respectively), suggests that the bases of these stems may have been in alternative conformations.",

In contrast, protoplasts inoculated with the three deletion mutants (p71\u039410, p71\u039460, \u0394int) contained negligible levels of minus or plus-strand RNAs. The signals for minus-strand RNA frequently appeared as doublets. These are likely due to breathing in the AUAUC sequence immediately adjacent to the non-specific portion of the probe, which resulted in two S1 protection patterns. The intensity of each band in the doublet varies from experiment to experiment, and shows no correlation to a particular transcript used as inoculum. Coat protein accumulation (data not shown) mirrored the plus-RNA accumulation, suggesting that sub-genomic RNA accumulation was affected similarly by the deletions. These data indicate that deletion of 10 nt, including the hexanucleotide element near the 5\u2032 region of the 3\u2032 NTR, resulted in inhibition of minus-strand RNA accumulation. As expected, the longer deletion of most of the 3\u2032 NTR in p71\u039460 also was unable to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. Although the \u0394int mutant contains the hexanucleotide element, the U-rich element and other sequences downstream, deletion of the sequence between these elements was detrimental to minus-strand RNA accumulation. Either the sequence in this region, the importance of this sequence to structure, and/or the spacing between the hexanucleotide and U-rich elements are necessary for RNA synthesis. Because minus-strand RNA synthesis was inhibited for all of these deletion mutants, plus-strand RNA levels were reduced similarly. These data demonstrate that multiple elements within the 3\u2032 NTR are required for minus-strand, and hence plus-strand, RNA accumulation.",

In contrast, mutant SL2-C was created to retain the U-rich element within an altered structure by changing only the 5\u2032 side of the stem (C6390CAG to GGUC). This resulted in disruption of both SL3 and SL2, and predicted formation of a single, large stem-loop structure (Figure 7(B)).

These data are similar to those observed for mutant SL3-C (Figure 6(C)), which also was predicted to have a combined SL3/SL2 structure.

Although p72\u039413 and p72\u039416 have identical structures, they differ in only three nucleotides and this sequence difference reduces the minus-strand RNA accumulation from wild-type levels in p72\u039413 to 70% of wild-type in p72\u039416. When the deletion was extended two nucleotides in the upstream direction and five nucleotides in the downstream direction (mutant p72\u039423), minus-strand RNA accumulation in protoplasts dropped to 5% of wild-type. Thus, it was not surprising that deletion of the 3\u2032- terminal 15 nt plus the poly(A) tail in the mutant \u039415 resulted in no minus-strand RNA accumulation. It is unlikely that the deletion of GG at the upstream end of the deletion in p72\u039423 was solely responsible for the reduction in minus-strand RNA accumulation because these two nucleotides were mutated in SL2-2A, which exhibited minus-strand RNA accumulation similar to wild-type levels. Thus, nucleotides from A6425\u2013A6432 are required for minus-strand RNA accumulation, whereas at least U6412\u2013A6424 and potentially G6410\u2013A6424 are not necessary. Similarly, other groups have identified dispensable sequences in the 3\u2032 NTRs of several plant33., 55., 56., 57. and animal58., 59. viral RNAs.",

Thus, this region of the PVX 3\u2032 NTR appears to have a dual role in minus-strand RNA synthesis and plus-strand RNA stability and/or polyadenylation. It is possible that correctly polyadenylated templates are important for PVX minus-strand RNA synthesis. When WClMV transcripts containing no poly(A) tail were inoculated into pea protoplasts, replication proceeded very slowly.36 The importance of poly(A) length was observed also for BaMV, where no or short poly(A) tails did not support genomic and subgenomic plus-strand RNA accumulation.34 In addition, it appears that BaMV minus-strand RNA initiates at multiple sites within the 5\u2032 most 15 A residues of the poly(A) tail.66 The importance of a poly(A) tail in virus RNA accumulation was observed for coronaviruses. The 3\u2032 NTR and the poly(A) tail of MHV RNA are required for minus-strand synthesis,59 and a poly(A) tail of at least five A residues was required for efficient replication of bovine coronavirus (BCV) RNA.67 Our data show that deletions in the regions of the PVX NUEs (mutants p72\u039423 and \u039415) resulted in negligible levels of minus-strand RNA, suggesting that elements necessary for minus-strand RNA accumulation and those needed for efficient polyadenylation and/or stability overlap near the 3\u2032 end of the PVX 3\u2032 NTR.",
