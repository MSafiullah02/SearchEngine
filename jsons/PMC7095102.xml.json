Indeed, fecal\u2013oral transmission does exist with other respiratory viruses10. These findings also suggest that rectal swab-testing may be more useful than nasopharyngeal swab-testing in judging the effectiveness of treatment and determining the timing of termination of quarantine12.

All highly suspected and confirmed pediatric cases in Guangzhou were admitted to this hospital after the SARS-CoV-2 infection was classified as a reportable disease in the Infectious Disease Law and Health and Quarantine Law in China on 20 January 2020. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made using real-time RT\u2013PCR in the virology laboratory of our hospital and then further confirmed by either Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or Guangdong Provincial CDC. Nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected upon admission and then every 1\u20133 d throughout the hospitalization period. SARS-CoV-2 was tested through real-time RT\u2013PCR of 2019-nCoVRNA as previously reported6.
