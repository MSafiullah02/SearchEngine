Otorrhea, adjacent cervical lymph node enlargement, and local cellulitis may develop later in the course of more severe cases. The most common bacterial causes of OE include Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus [1]. Typical physical examination findings include erythema and edema of the EAC with debris, cerumen, and purulent material filling the canal. Visualization of the tympanic membrane (TM) is often obstructed by the otorrhea and the swelling associated with the inflammation. An unimpaired view of a normal TM, with visible landmarks, is shown in \u25d8 Fig. 4.1. The diagnosis of OE is made based on the history and the clinical findings. Typical otoscopic findings of OE are shown in \u25d8 Fig. 4.2. When the EAC is cultured, one must be cognizant that culture results may reflect EAC flora rather than a causative organism. First-line antibiotic treatments include topical otic drops of a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin with or without topical glucocorticoid drops. If edema of the EAC is severe, placement of a wick inside the EAC\nmay be necessary to ensure delivery of medication to the more proximal areas of infection. Risk of recurrence of OE is increased in individuals with atopic dermatitis, seborrhea, immune compromise, and repeated local trauma to the area when cleaning the ear. A fungal etiology of the infection should be considered when otorrhea is prolonged, especially if topical antibacterials and a wick have been used already. Individuals who use hearing aids and those who have had recent bacterial infections\nare also at risk for fungal disease. The most common fungal etiologies include Aspergillus and Candida species [1].\n\n",

Under normal conditions, the eustachian tube allows the middle ear to drain to the pharynx and to equalize pressure between the middle ear and the environment. Impaired drainage may be present for several reasons. The anatomic position of the shorter eustachian tube in young children maintains a relatively horizontal orientation allowing the drainage to defy gravity. Adenoidal hypertrophy and anatomic anomalies of the palate can also block or impair normal drainage. The presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, allergic rhinitis, and viral upper respiratory infections can all lead to inflammation of the eustachian tube and surrounding tissues resulting in the presence of increased secretions in the middle ear that accumulates because the eustachian tube is not fully patent [2\u20134]. In each of these clinical scenarios, negative pressure develops in the eustachian tube and middle ear space. The small number of bacteria normally present in those secretions replicates in the now closed space resulting in acute infection ( AOM). Retained nasopharyngeal secretions are very common in individuals with otherwise uncomplicated viral respiratory infections. A subgroup of these individuals experience secondary bacterial infection because the initial viral infection and its associated inflammation allow for the closed space conditions\nwhere the bacteria can thrive.",

Less common bacterial etiologies of AOM include Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as group A streptococcus, the cause of \u201cstrep throat\u201d) and Staphylococcus aureus. S. pyogenes is more commonly seen among those older than 5 years of age. Its presentation is typically quite aggressive leading to perforation of the TM and/or accompanying mastoiditis [2]. S. aureus should be included on the list of possible infecting agents in patients who have tympanostomy tubes, as these medical devices serve as a conduit between the bacteria normally present in the EAC and the middle ear.

A thorough otoscopic exam, including pneumatic otoscopy and clear visualization of the TM and EAC, is essential. Presuming a diagnosis of AOM in the absence of a thorough examination leads to overdiagnosis and subsequent overuse of antibiotics. Pneumatic otoscopy should always be included to assess the mobility of the TM. Efficient pneumatic otoscopy is aided by using a speculum with a tight seal of the EAC [4]. Classic otoscopy findings of AOM include the presence of fluid in middle ear space, outward bulging of the TM secondary to the increased pressure in the middle ear space, loss of visualization of ossicle bony landmarks behind the TM, and erythema or injection of radial vessels on the TM. The middle ear effusion is purulent in AOM\nbut must be carefully distinguished from opaque noninfectious effusions secondary to OME. The absence of erythema of the TM suggests a diagnosis of OME, not AOM. A bulging TM with decreased mobility on pneumatic otoscopy is the most specific exam finding for bacterial AOM [4]. The presence of purulent otorrhea in the EAC is seen if a TM perforation has occurred before the time of examination. This finding must be distinguished from the edema and erythema that occur along the EAC during otitis externa. Bullae may be present on the TM in conjunction with other signs of acute inflammation. The findings are consistent with a form of AOM termed bullous myringitis. The presence of bullae does not suggest a specific microbiologic cause nor does it change the clinical approach to the condition.",

The change in color and consistency is secondary to innate immune responses to the virus, with recruitment of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase allows for some of the oxygen-free radicals to be converted to hypochlorite. It is the presence of this halogenated compound that renders the color change, not the presence of bacteria. Acute bacterial infections trigger the same innate immune inflammatory pathways, explaining why the discharge seen during a bacterial infection also has a yellow-green color.

Known complications involve contiguous spread of the infection to adjacent structures and include subperiosteal abscesses, Bezold\u2019s abscesses (infection of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscle attachments), facial nerve paralysis, meningitis, subdural empyema, brain abscess, venous sinus thrombosis, labyrinthitis, temporal bone osteomyelitis, cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea, or conductive hearing loss secondary to destruction of the bony ossicles. Progressive disease can lead to systemic infection with bacteremia and distal septic emboli. A rare but classic complication known as Gradenigo\u2019s syndrome is diagnosed when there is petrositis with associated otitis media, ipsilateral medial rectus palsy, eye pain, and possible additional cranial nerve abnormalities [8].",

Two days into his course of amoxicillin, he seemed to improve and his fevers resolved. Two days after he completed his antibiotic course, his fevers returned and his mother noticed redness and swelling behind his right ear.
