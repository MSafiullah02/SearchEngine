Knowledge that dengue virus may invade the CNS also leads to the question of the role it plays in patients presenting with symptoms or signs of CNS infection. In a separate study, Ara\u00fajo and colleagues addressed this issue by retrospectively examining the incidence of dengue infection in patients with suspected viral meningitis or meningoencephalitis in the same endemic region of Brazil, possibly during a period of epidemic activity. They studied CSF from 183 living patients and 26 deceased subjects. Using the same diagnostic tests as in their other study, they found evidence of CNS involvement by dengue virus in 8 (3.6%) individuals, 5 of the 183 living patients and 3 of the 26 deceased subjects.",

The recommended duration of therapy of latent tuberculosis with daily rifampin alone is 4 months; with weekly observed isoniazid (INH) and rifapentine it is 3 months, while that of daily INH alone is 6-9 months. The requirememt for the prolonged duration of INH administration when administered as a single agent is believed to be the result of its inactivity against nonreplicating bacilli. In addition, INH is not active under hypoxic conditions, as exist in caseating granulomas. Metronidazole, on the other hand, though not active in an aerobic environment, is bactericidally active in vitro against nonreplicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis under hypoxic conditions in vitro.",

In this model, administration of INH alone for 6 months or INH plus rifampin for 2 months were each highly effective in the prevention of reactivation disease, while administration of metronidazole alone for 2 months was equally effective. Metronidazole also demonstrated benefit in active tuberculosis when added to INH and rifampin with all 3 administered for only 3 months.",

Excluding allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell recipients, \u00d6hrmalm and colleagues in Stockholm prospectively studied 123 adults with fever and neutropenia as well as 36 neutropenic patients who were afebrile.
