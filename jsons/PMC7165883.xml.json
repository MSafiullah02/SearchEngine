Long\u2010time epidemiological observation indicates that only 5\u201310% of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection progress to active TB in their lifetime. Whether a person develops TB depends on host\u2013pathogen interactions. There are several lines of evidence indicating that susceptibility to TB is determined partly by the host genetic factors, and possibly influenced by environmental factors as well (Schurr, 2007). Mutations in genes of the interferon\u2010\u03b3 signalling pathway result in increased susceptibility to TB. Several other susceptibility genes, such as SLC11A1 (NRAMP1), NOD2, MCP1, ALOX5, TLR genes, have also been identified (Schurr, 2007; Austin et al., 2008).",

A specific small molecule inhibitor of AKT1, H\u201089, could significantly inhibit proliferation of M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv and multi\u2010drug resistant strain MDR16319 in primary human macrophages, without inducing apoptosis of the host cells (Kuijl et al., 2007). Specific knockdown of AKT expression with AKT1/2\u2010siRNA prevents intracellular growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis in human macrophages. Previous study has found that activation of AKT prevents phagosome maturation (Hernandez et al., 2004). Inhibition of AKT1 can induce phagosome maturation to phagolysosomes, resulting in killing of intracellular bacteria (Kuijl et al., 2007). Therefore, AKT1 inhibitors have the potential to be used as antibiotics for the treatment of TB, especially drug\u2010resistant TB.",

The group B streptococcus requires the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway for invasion of epithelial cells (Burnham et al., 2007). Akt1 inhibitors could significantly reduce growth of Salmonella typhimurium and M. tuberculosis in host cells through inducing phagosome maturation to phagolysosomes (Kuijl et al., 2007) and might be used as antibiotics for the treatment of infection.",

Recently an AKT1 E17K somatic mutation was identified. This mutation leads to pathological localization to the plasma membrane and activates AKT1, and is implicated in human breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers (Carpten et al., 2007). To our knowledge, there is no any report on relationship of human AKT1 polymorphisms with susceptibility to TB. In this study, we found association of the IVS3+18C>T SNP and the T\u2013A haplotype with pulmonary TB. Since +726G>A is a synonymous SNP, it is possible that IVS3+18C>T polymorphism might involve in the regulation of AKT1 expression and should be studied further. Previous studies have proved that SNPs can significantly alter the expression or activity of AKT1 (Harris et al., 2005; Carpten et al., 2007), it is possible that SNPs on the AKT1 locus might influence controlling of M. tuberculosis replication in humans and ultimately development of active disease.",
