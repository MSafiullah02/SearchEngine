Unhealthy alcohol consumption is associated with a number of chronic medical conditions common in older adults1 Of particular concern, suicide risk is elevated among older adults with both depression and alcohol use disorders2. In 2015-2017, 10.6% of adults over 65 reported unhealthy drinking (5+ drinks in a day for men / 4+ drinks in a day for women) in the prior 30 days, an increase over previous years3. Current NIH guidelines recommend that adults age 65 and over consume no more than 7 drinks per week and no more than 3 drinks in one day. However, for older adults with common medical conditions or psychiatric disorders there may be no level of safe alcohol use.",

There is strong evidence that smoking tobacco puts people at risk for more severe COVID-19-related symptoms; data from China indicate a case fatality rate of 6.3% for individuals with chronic respiratory disease, compared with 2.3% overall7. Vaping nicotine is thought to be less harmful than combustible tobacco yet there are also growing concerns that vaping nicotine may damage lungs in ways that make users especially vulnerable to COVID-19-related symptoms8.",

As with younger adults, older people who misuse opioids are likely to have comorbid psychiatric and other substance use disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic poses substantial challenges to effective pain management and to addiction treatment for older adults. For those who use medications as prescribed, interruption of regular medical visits is a barrier to careful monitoring. Among individuals with an opioid use disorder who are engaged in treatment, care disruption may lead to decreased access to methadone, buprenorphine, naloxone treatment for overdose, as well as critical social services11. Lack of treatment access, in combination with social isolation, increases vulnerability to relapse and overdose for older adults during the pandemic.",

Between 2010 and 2016, among older adults in the Veterans Administration, the prevalence of benzodiazepine use has ranged from approximately 9% to 11% and incidence of new prescriptions has held steady at approximately 2%13. As of this writing, there are no published data regarding changes in benzodiazepine prescription rates associated with COVID-19; however, previous research has demonstrated increased use associated with disaster situations14. The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria strongly recommends avoiding benzodiazepine use, except in specific circumstances (e.g., alcohol withdrawal), because of the potential for cognitive impairment, falls, fractures, motor-vehicle accidents, other serious injuries, and delirium12. These hazards may be magnified by concurrent alcohol consumption, illicit substance and opioid use, and opioid-replacement therapy with methadone or buprenorphine.",

Fortunately, there is evidence that gradual discontinuation of benzodiazepines is feasible, safe, and can be completed in primary care as well as mental health treatment contexts15.",

These concerns are compounded in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The already elevated risk of suicide in older adults has the potential to be increased by social isolation, anxiety and depression related to COVID-19, and by alcohol and other substance use. Racial/ethnic disparities in income and insurance coverage can exacerbate these problems. It is important for future research to examine how major categories of substance use impact COVID-19 outcomes among older adults, how social isolation and mental health conditions may increase substance use among older adults, and how intervention strategies (including those offered through telemedicine) can help to mitigate substance use problems. Providers should be alert to potential increases in substance use among vulnerable patients. Risks to older adults can be addressed by helping to expand access to interventions, and by incorporating the assistance of partners, family, and caregivers in helping older patients use healthier coping techniques to manage stress as the pandemic continues.",
