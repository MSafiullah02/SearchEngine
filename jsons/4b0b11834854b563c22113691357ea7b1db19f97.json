The COVID-19 epidemic is associated with anxiety, depression, distress, sleep disturbances, and suicidality (1-7).",

Another nationwide survey of more than 50,000 people in China during the COVID-19 epidemic showed that about 35% of the respondents experienced psychological distress (4). Another research group in China sampled and analyzed the online posts from about 18,000 Chinese social media users before and after the declaration of COVID-19 in China on January 20, 2020 (5). Researchers found that negative emotions such as anxiety, depression and anger increased, while the positive emotions and life satisfaction decreased.",

The authors noted that \"anxiety and stress of isolated individuals were at high levels, while the sleep quality was low.\" Researchers in China also examined a state of mental health of about 1250 health care professionals who treated coronavirus patients (7) . 50.4% of study participants reported depression, 44.6% anxiety, 34.0% insomnia, and 71.5% distress.",

Appropriate treatment of sleep disturbances is always vital and reduces symptoms of psychiatric disorders and suicidality. However, recognizing and treating insomnia are especially important during stressful times such as the COVID-19 epidemic because it may significantly reduce suicides. It is important to identify and treat sleep disorders not only among psychiatric patient but also among individuals who are not in psychiatric treatment. People with sleep disturbances need to be evaluated for suicidal ideation and suicide intent. Clinicians need to be educated on how to assess individuals with sleep disorders for suicidality.",
