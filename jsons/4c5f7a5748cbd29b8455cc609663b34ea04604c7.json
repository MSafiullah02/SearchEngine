            "text": "A COVID-19 epidemic has been spreading in China and other parts of the world since December 2019. The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. We sampled college students from Changzhi medical college by using cluster sampling. They responded to a questionnaire packet that included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and those inquiring the participants' basic information. We received 7,143 responses. Results indicated that 0.9% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 2.7% moderate anxiety, and 21.3% mild anxiety. Moreover, living in urban areas (OR = 0.810, 95% CI = 0.709 -0.925), family income stability (OR = 0.726, 95% CI = 0.645 -0.817) and living with parents (OR = 0.752, 95% CI = 0.596 -0.950) were protective factors against anxiety. Moreover, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students (OR = 3.007, 95% CI = 2.377 -3.804). Results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects, and effects on daily life, as well as delays in academic activities, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms (P < .001). However, social support was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (P < .001). It is suggested that the mental health of college students should be monitored during epidemics.",

This large scale, infectious, public health event, imposed enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical and healthcare providers, and the general public (Pan et al., 2020; C. Wang et al., 2020) . Thirty-one provinces in China initiated a Level-1 public health response (Deng et al., 2020) . The epidemic brought not only the risk of death from the viral infection but also unbearable psychological pressure to people in China and the rest of the world (Xiao, 2020; Duan, 2020) . The continuous spread of the epidemic, strict isolation measures and delays in starting schools, colleges, and universities across the country is expected to influence the mental health of college students. There have been reports on the psychological impact of the epidemic on the general public, patients, medical staff, children, and older adults (Q. Chen et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) . However, no detailed study on the mental health status of college students facing the epidemic has been conducted to date.",

The GAD-7 takes less than 3 min to complete and easy to score (Budikayanti et al., 2019) . Today, the GAD-7 is the most widely used measure of anxiety used in clinical practice and research due to its diagnostic reliability and efficiency (Johnson et al., 2019) . It can be applied for screening, diagnosis, and the assessment of the severity of anxiety disorders, as well as for social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorders, and panic disorders (Moreno et al., 2019 Methods of guiding students to effectively and appropriately regulate their emotions during public health emergencies and avoid losses caused by crisis events have become an urgent problem for colleges and universities. Therefore, we investigated and analyzed the mental health status of college students during the epidemic for the following purposes. (1) To evaluate the mental situation of college students during the epidemic; (2) to provide a theoretical basis for psychological interventions with college students; and (3) to provide a basis for the promulgation of national and governmental policies.",

This survey indicated that 24.9% of college students were afflicted with experienced anxiety because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Of these students, 0.9% experienced severe anxiety, and 21.3% experienced mild anxiety. College students' anxiety about COVID-19 might have been related to the effect of the virus on their studies (Cornine et al., 2020) and future employment (C. Wang et al., 2020) . On the other hand, the students' anxiety may have been caused by the gradually increasing distances between people resulting from the quarantine.

            "text": "It has been indicated that the increasing number of patients and suspected cases, as well as the increasing number of provinces and countries affected by the outbreak, have elicited public worry about being infected in this outbreak, which has increased anxiety . Furthermore, the significant shortage of masks and disinfectants, the overwhelming and sensational news headlines, and erroneous news reports have also added to anxiety and fear (Ayittey et al., 2020) . The results of this study indicated college students' anxiety regarding the epidemic was associated with their place of residence, source of parental income, whether living with parents and whether a relative or an acquaintance was infected with COVID-19. However, no significant r Correlation coefficient. Cao, et al. Psychiatry Research 287 (2020) 112934 difference in gender or region was indicated, which is different from previous findings (Moreno et al., 2019) . This difference indicates that male and female students experienced similar stresses and negative emotions as a result of the epidemic. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis suggested that living in urban areas, in contrast to rural areas, was conducive to reducing the anxiety of college students. This might be explained by the imbalance of economic, cultural, and educational resources between urban and rural areas. The urban economy is relatively prosperous and provides citizens with better material security (Shigemura et al., 2020) . Similarly, the sanitary conditions in cities are better than in towns and villages, which decreases the chances of surviving the virus. Cities also have excellent educational resources, and they have made great efforts to publicize knowledge on how to prevent the epidemic, which attracts attention to the measures taken to stop the epidemic . The stability of family income was also was a significant factor in students' experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis, which could be explained by increased psychological and economic pressure (Liu, 2013) . Living with parents was another favorable factor against feeling anxious. Previous studies have indicated that the risk factors associated with emotional and anxiety disorders in adults include the death of parents in childhood, not living with parents, and parents' psychological problems and mental illnesses (Woodgate et al., al.,2020; Gentili et al., 2020) , which are consistent with the results of this study. Relatives or acquaintances being infected with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor in college students' anxiety about the epidemic, which might be related to the high contagiousness of the new coronavirus pneumonia (World Health Organization, 2020; Song et al., 2019) .",

Similar studies (Kernan, 2019) have indicated that in addition to the national health situation, the epidemic will also have a significant impact on the economy of the country and individuals. Because of the outbreak, some families will lose their source of income, and students might feel anxious about paying their tuition fees (Peng et al., 2012) . In China, the government took measures, including travel warnings and bans, and extending the national holidays to control the outbreak, which inevitably disrupted routine life and resulted in anxiety. In the mainland China and Hong Kong, all primary and secondary schools were closed, and universities were either postponing classes until March 2020 or were using distant/remote learning methods (Kwok et al., 2020) . These measures undoubtedly have a specific impact on the education and the growth of students. Finally, social support was negatively correlated with the anxiety of college students, which is consistent with previous findings (Thompson et al., 2016; Q. Chen et al., 2020) . Social support not only reduces the psychological pressure during the epidemics but also changes the attitude regarding social support and help-seeking methods. This result suggests that effective and robust social support is necessary during public health emergencies (Bai et al., 2005) .",
