            "text": "Driven by the possible use of ammonia\u2013borane (H3N\u22c5BH3) as a chemical storage medium for H2,1 the formation of boron\u2013nitrogen \u03c3 bonds by the catalytic dehydrocoupling of amine\u2013boranes is currently receiving a great deal of attention.2 Manners, for example, has reported that dehydrocoupling of MeNH2\n\u22c5BH3 to oligomeric or polymeric compounds may be effected by both homo\u2010 and heterogeneous Group 9 species.3 Exemplified by this work, most progress has been based around the study of mid or late transition metals and relatively little attention has been directed toward d0 species of the early transition metals (Groups 3\u20135) or metals of Groups 1 and 2.4\u20136 In contrast to the reactivity derived from low oxidation state or more electron\u2010rich catalytic centers, these series of metals must necessarily preclude the possibility of B\u2014H oxidative addition (via B\u2014H \u03c3\u2010borane complexes)7 and/or B\u2014N reductive elimination as pathways toward amidoborane formation.1c Keller demonstrated in the 1970s that more complex amidoboranes could be prepared by a combination of R2N\u2014 for H exchange and H2 elimination from the interaction of either lithium primary amides and B2H6 or alkali metal hydrides and amine\u2013boranes.8 A recent report by Sneddon and co\u2010workers has highlighted the ability of the strong, non\u2010nucleophilic base bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene and the Group 1 derivatives lithium and potassium triethylborohydride to effect H3N\u22c5BH3 dehydrogenation by initial nitrogen deprotonation to form [H3BNH2]\u2212 and subsequent anionic dehydropolymerization.9 Although hydrogen release may be promoted by solid\u2010state ball milling with MgH2, and conversion of H3N\u22c5BH3 to the crystallographically characterized calcium amidotrihydoborates [Ca(NH2BH3)2(thf)n] (n=0, 1, 2) has been reported to result in significantly reduced hydrogen release temperatures, these solid\u2010state reactions are, necessarily, mechanistically uncertain.10, 11 Two years ago we reported that \u03c3\u2010bond metathesis reactions of \u03b2\u2010diketiminato calcium amides with the secondary organoborane 9\u2010BBN (9\u2010borobicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) result in the formation of B\u2014N bonded species and a calcium hydride as the reaction products.12 More recently, Harder has reported that sequential H2 elimination can be induced from \u03b2\u2010diketiminato calcium amidoborane derivatives of both H3N\u22c5BH3 itself and BH3 adducts of primary amines and anilines.13 In these cases further thermally induced B\u2014N formation apparently occurred via the intermediacy of dimeric calcium complexes of the complex dianions [RN\u2010BH\u2010NR\u2010BH3]2\u2212 (R=H; Me; iPr). In cases in which dimerization was not possible, unimolecular H2 elimination provided species containing coordinated imidoborane anions. Most recently, the same group reported that di\u2010n\u2010butyl magnesium or a \u03b2\u2010diketiminate\u2010supported magnesium silylamide are capable of the catalytic dehydrocoupling of the primary anilino\u2013borane, (Dipp)NH2BH3 (Dipp=2,6\u2010di\u2010iso\u2010propylphenyl), via the intermediacy of a structurally characterized magnesium anilido species, [HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2Mg{NH(Dipp)BH3}] (I), [Link]\nchemical structure image\nin the case of the heteroleptic derivative.6a The only dehydrocoupled product to be fully characterized was [HB{NH(Dipp)}2], proposed to be the result of \u03b2\u2010hydride elimination and BH3 evolution from a more complex, but unidentified, species derived from I containing an additional B\u2014N linkage (Scheme 1). Although sound precedent has been provided for the intermediacy of a resultant magnesium hydride by the same authors\u2019 isolation of a tetrahydridoborane magnesium species from this reaction and their synthesis of the zinc hydride II via an analogous zinc primary amidoborane derivative,6a, b no rationale was developed for the mechanism of B\u2014N bond formation and concurrent H2 elimination to provide the complex intermediate [(Dipp)NHBH2NH(Dipp)BH3]\u2212 ion during the dehydrocoupling reaction (Scheme 1). Rather, these authors suggested that this central step simply occurs by a mechanistically undefined reaction of the isolated magnesium amidoborane with the acidic ammonia\u2013borane (Dipp)NH2BH3.6a\n",

The corresponding proton\u2010coupled 11B NMR spectra revealed the complete disappearance of a resonance attributable to the Me2NH\u22c5BH3 starting material (\u03b4\n11B 11.9 ppm, 1\nJ\nHB=97.3 Hz) and evidence of two new boron environments observed at 4.0 and \u221215.3 ppm, which appeared as triplet (1\nJ\nHB=102 Hz) and quartet (1\nJ\nHB=89 Hz) signals, respectively. The origin of these observations was revealed by a single\u2010crystal X\u2010ray diffraction analysis performed upon crystals of compound 1 isolated from hexane. Details of this X\u2010ray analysis are given in Table 1 and selected bond length and angle data are provided in the caption to Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, compound 1 is a discrete magnesium complex in which the magnesium coordination sphere is composed of a molecule of THF and two borylamido anions, [H3BNMe2BH2Me2N]\u2212. These latter ligands may be considered as the deprotonated form of H3BNMe2BH2Me2NH (III),15 the product of a single dehydrocoupling reaction between two Me2NHBH3 molecules. Although III has previously been postulated as a key intermediate in the catalytic dehydrocoupling of Me2NH\u22c5BH3 and the dianionic species [H3BNHBHNH]2\u2212 has been identified from the calcium\u2010induced dehydrocouping of ammonia\u2013borane itself,3a, 4e,h,i, 12a to the best of our knowledge, the ligand within compound 1 is the first example of this particular anion to be crystallographically characterized. The primary interactions between the [H3BNMe2BH2Me2N]\u2212 ions and magnesium are provided by the formally deprotonated nitrogen atom of each ligand. The observed bond lengths (Mg1\u2014N1 2.1649(11), Mg1\u2014N3 2.1684(11) \u00c5) are considerably longer than those observed between magnesium and the anilidoborane anion within I (Mg\u2014N 2.083(4) \u00c5), but are only slightly elongated in comparison to those within Mg(Me2C5H3BNMe2)2 (Mg\u2014N 2.140(3), 2.142(3) \u00c5), in which the three\u2010coordinate boron center forms part of a delocalized boratabenzene fragment.14 Coordination to magnesium evidently produces only minor perturbations to the boron\u2013nitrogen bond lengths of the chelated anion in comparison to the crystallographically characterized species III (B1\u2014N1: 1 1.5647(17), III 1.599(2); B1\u2014N2: 1 1.6145(17), III 1.589(2); B2\u2014N2: 1 1.5762(17), III 1.600(2) \u00c5).15 Although the B\u2014N bond lengths across the \u2010NHBHNH\u2010 unit of the bridging and calcium\u2010coordinated dianionic species, [H3BNHBHNH]2\u2212, (CaNH\u2014BH: 1.419(5); NH\u2014BH(NH): 1.451(6) \u00c5) were greatly shortened in comparison to the relevant B\u2014N bond lengths within the structure of 1, the bond lengths to the \u201cterminal\u201d \u2014BH3 component of both anions are significantly shortened within 1 (B2\u2014N2: 1.5762(17) and B3\u2014N3: 1.5646(17) versus 1.593(6) \u00c5).13 These variations are likely to be a result of both the widely differing charge distribution across the two NBNB moieties, as well as the reduced number of metal\u2010to\u2010ligand contacts within the strictly mononuclear species 1. Monitoring of the B\u2014H region of the 1H{11B} NMR spectrum between 228 K and 288 K provided evidence for two independent fluxional processes in [D8]toluene. At temperatures below 258 K, the resonances associated with the BH2 unit of the ligand backbone occupy diastereotopic environments, most likely owing to the maintenance of a conformation of the chelated ligand similar to that observed in the solid state (Figure 2). The coalescence of these resonances is possibly indicative of either rapid coordination/de\u2010coordination of the THF co\u2010ligand or a facile conformational interconversion process (\u0394G\n\u2260=44.1 kJ mol\u22121) at temperatures above 258 K. The resonances associated with the BH3 units of compound 1 also displayed a rather more complex decoalescence event at low temperature (<248 K), suggestive of a low\u2010energy conformational change, possibly involving the rapid coordination and decoordination of terminal and Mg\u2010bound hydrides. Although a value for T\nc could not be accurately determined for this latter event, both processes indicate that the coordination of the NBNB\u2014H chelate to magnesium is, to some extent, retained in toluene. The occurrence of these processes was rather more clearly defined through monitoring of the N\u2014Me region of the same series of variable temperature spectra (Figure 2). Again two fluxional events were apparent at temperatures below 258 K and provided free energies of activation for both processes (for \u03b4\nH=2.33 ppm, \u0394G\n\u2260=42.4 kJ mol\u22121; for \u03b4\nH=2.23 ppm, \u0394G\n\u2260=46.6 kJ mol\u22121) effectively identical to that deduced for the boron\u2010centered unit within the limits the of experimental observations.",

A reaction of the \u03b2\u2010diketiminate complex [HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2MgnBu] with two equivalents of Me2NH\u22c5BH3 resulted in the formation of a single compound (2), which displayed a similar but broadened 11B NMR (\u03b4=4.1, \u221214.9 ppm) spectrum to those recorded for compound 1. The identity of compound 2 was confirmed by a combination of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and a single\u2010crystal X\u2010ray diffraction experiment, the results of which are illustrated in Figure 3. Details of the analysis are given in Table 1, while selected bond length and angle data are provided in the figure caption. Compound 2 contains a pseudo\u2010four\u2010coordinate magnesium center, in which the coordination sphere of the alkaline earth element is provided by the bidentate \u03b2\u2010diketiminate ligand and a chelated [H3BNMe2BH2Me2N]\u2212 ion identical to that observed in the homoleptic species, compound 1. The amidoborane ligand binds to the magnesium in an exactly analogous manner in both compounds 1 and 2. The presence of the sterically demanding \u03b2\u2010diketiminate ligand and the reduced formal coordination number of the magnesium center in compound 2 produce only minor adjustments to the bond lengths and angles around the six\u2010membered MgNBNBH heterocycle. Although compound 2 proved to be more thermally robust, NMR monitoring of a sample heated to 60 \u00b0C for 16 h also resulted in the production (ca. 20 % conversion) of [(H2BNMe2)2]. Of more significance, however, was the concurrent production of a small quantity of Jones\u2019 recently reported dimeric magnesium hydride [{HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2MgH(thf)}2],16 identified by comparison to the 1H NMR literature data and again indicative of a reaction pathway analogous to the \u03b2\u2010hydride elimination illustrated in Scheme 1, but involving the \u03b4\u2010located BH3 unit within the chelated anion of 2.",

Although quite slow, the catalytic dehydrocoupling protocol illustrated by Scheme 2 provided clean and selective conversion to the dimerized species [(H2BNMe2)2] over the course of 72 h. A number of notable features were also apparent from inspection of the 11B NMR spectra recorded during the dehydrocoupling process (Figure 4). The presence of a BH2 unit of an intermediate analogous to the Mg\u2010coordinated [H3BNMe2BH2Me2N]\u2212 species observed in the well\u2010defined compounds 1 and 2 was inferred from the presence of a low intensity triplet at about 4 ppm (1\nJ\nHB=101 Hz) throughout the reaction. An additional quartet resonance at approximately \u22129 ppm (1\nJ\nHB=92 Hz) was not assigned to the corresponding BH3 component of the anion, on the basis of the signal intensity and the lower field chemical shift compared to those observed in either 1 or 2, Rather, on the basis of a 11B\u201011B correlation experiment, this low intensity signal is proposed to be obscured by the quartet resonance of the Me2NH\u22c5BH3 starting material and it is notable that Weller and co\u2010workers have recently made similar deductions during studies of the Rh\u2010catalyzed dehydrocoupling of the same substrate.4i Having tentatively assigned a similar downfield triplet resonance to the trimerized species [(H2BNMe2)3] in their original communication,4e this group later revised their assignment of this resonance as arising from the BH2 unit of the neutral product III. Through comparison to the deshielded environments observed for heavier metal derivatives of the same ligands (see below), the more intense downfield signal at \u22129 ppm is proposed to arise from a magnesium\u2010coordinated anion derived by deprotonation of a single equivalent of the Me2NH\u22c5BH3 starting material. The diaminoborane HB(NMe2)2 was also observed at early stages of, and throughout, the course of the reaction. Although the reaction of HB(NMe2)2 with diborane has been reported to result in longer chain amine\u2013boranes,8b this species was not consumed and our supposition is that this species is formed through a parallel but less significant reaction pathway involving elimination of a \u03b2\u2010hydride from the coordinated [H3BNMe2BH2Me2N]\u2212 ion followed by loss of BH3.17 A similar \u03b2\u2010hydride elimination has been proposed to occur during the magnesium\u2010catalyzed production of [HB{NH(Dipp)}2] from (Dipp)NH2BH3.\n6a Although in this last case the occurrence of BH3 elimination was supported by the isolation of a magnesium tetrahydridoborate, we have observed no evidence for this process and assume that BH3 is displaced as B2H6 and one of the, as yet, unmonitored gaseous by\u2010products.",

No triplet resonance assignable to the appearance of a [H3BNMe2BH2Me2N]\u2212 ion, such as that observed in compounds 1 and 2, was observed at room temperature. Although no tractable single products have yet been isolated from this reaction, a further stoichiometric reaction between the \u03b2\u2010diketiminate calcium amide [HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2Ca{N(SiMe3)2}(thf)] and Me2NH\u22c5BH3 provided a significant insight into these observations. This reaction provided smooth access at room temperature to the simple amidoborane derivative [HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2Ca{NMe2BH3}(thf)] (4), irrespective of the presence of an excess of the amine\u2013borane reagent. Compound 4 provided a quartet resonance at \u221211.5 ppm (1\nJ\nHB=86 Hz) in its 11B NMR spectrum and has been fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and a single\u2010crystal X\u2010ray structural analysis, the results of which are shown in Figure 5. Details of the crystallographic analysis are given in Table 1 and selected bond length and angle data are provided in the caption to the figure. The centrosymmetric structure consists of a mononuclear calcium complex in which the primary coordination to the metal is provided by the \u03ba2\u2010N,N\u2032\u2010\u03b2\u2010diketiminate and the \u03ba2\u2010N,BH dimethylamidoborane ligands, augmented by a molecule of THF.",

Although small quantities of HB(NMe2)2 were again apparent, perhaps significantly, a low intensity resonance at about 36 ppm was also observed, which may be assigned to monomeric Me2N=BH2.4a,i Careful inspection of the 1H NMR spectrum of this thermal reaction also provided evidence for the formation of the known \u03b2\u2010diketiminato calcium hydride [[HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2CaH(thf)]2,19 and we thus tentatively suggest that compound 4 undergoes a thermally induced \u03b2\u2010hydride elimination/intramolecular \u03c3\u2010bond metathesis process under these conditions. Although [(H2BNMe2)2] was not observed under these conditions, preliminary observations of stoichiometric and catalytic reactions of both [HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2Ca{N(SiMe3)2}(thf)] and the calcium dialkyl compound 3 with Me2NH\u22c5BH3 provided 11B NMR spectra similar to those illustrated in Figure 4 and evidence for [(H2BNMe2)2] formation by a common and sequential protonolysis\u2010metathesis pathway.",
