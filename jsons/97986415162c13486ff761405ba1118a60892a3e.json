Recent studies have shown that bat coronaviruses were the source of many human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and NL63 (Han et al., 2015) . The cDNA was generated from RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexamers. The cDNA was screened for the presence of coronavirus using a broad range heminested RT-PCR targeting conserved regions of the RdRp gene for detecting known and unknown coronaviruses as previously described (Hemida et al., 2017) . Positive and negative controls were included for each run. RT-PCR products were analysed using agarose gel electrophoresis to identify a product size of 440 base pairs indicating the presence of known or unknown coronaviruses. DNA sequencing was carried out on four strongly positive RT-PCR products at School of Public Health, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.",

Over the last few years, identification of new coronaviruses in bats including the most recently reported lineage D betacoronavirus in cave nectar bats (Eonycteris spelaea) in Singapore (Mendenhall et al., 2017) led us to investigate coronaviruses in fruit bats in Sri Lanka. Detection of lineage D betacoronavirus in guano collected from Pteropus medius bats shows the presence of these viruses in bats, which roost in public places such as the Botanic gardens. Lineage D betacoronaviruses are strictly confined to bats up to now; however, they might evolve to become harmful to humans with public health implications. Pteropus medius are one of the largest species of bats, roost in large trees near waterways or rivers and fly distances of up to 150 Km daily for foraging (Newman, Field, Jong, & Epstein, 2011) . They are widespread in South Asia and can be commonly found in peri-domestic settings. In some cultures, these species are also hunted and consumed as food. New bats are born during February-May, and the samples collected in this study were from this period of new bat birthing and may explain the high rates of virus detection observed.",
