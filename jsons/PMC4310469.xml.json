These risk groups include immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ALL patients experience immune suppression both from their disease and secondary to chemotherapy, which they receive for up to 3.5 years 2, 3. Children with cancer also have a higher frequency of influenza infections and longer duration of symptoms compared to healthy individuals.

Four months after receiving the SD TIV, one of the subjects was hospitalized for 3 days. Five months later after receiving the SD TIV, a second subject was hospitalized for a total of 6 days. In addition to influenza B, coronavirus was detected in this subject. Both subjects received treatment with oseltamivir and recovered from their illnesses. We do not know if the influenza B virus that was detected in these patients represented the same vaccine strain of influenza B, since reports of two different influenza B strains simultaneously circulating have been reported.",

These discrepancies may be explained by the use of different influenza vaccines: monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent; whole cell versus split cell; and varying doses (from 50 to 400 chicken cell\u2010agglutinating); different immunization schedules; different chemotherapeutic regimens; and most importantly inadequate samples sizes in those that did not find a statistically significant difference between children with and without cancer 23. The majority of these earlier studies; however, reported that lower antibody titers were achieved in individuals with cancer, including children with ALL, when compared to healthy controls 23. In addition, individuals receiving chemotherapy had significantly lower titers compared to those off chemotherapy 23. Lower immune responses in children with ALL receiving chemotherapy compared to healthy controls and children with ALL off\u2010chemotherapy were also reported in more current studies with TIV 14, 15, 19. Two studies compared TIV to a live\u2010attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in children with cancer; the first study proved it was safe to administer LAIV in these children 22. However, the second study revealed that the LAIV produced lower HAI titers compared to the TIV 21, suggesting that the LAIV was not as effective in this population compared to the TIV. Thus, these studies indicated that the optimal influenza vaccine does not exist at this time, and therefore this population could benefit from further research into improved influenza vaccines.",

This was a phase I study with a small number of patients enrolled and although we did not see any increased local or systemic reactions associated with the HD TIV, further studies with a larger population are needed. Recruitment occurred over two influenza seasons which is not ideal, but the vaccine formulations remained identical. Even though we limited our patients to children with ALL in remission and at least 4 weeks into the initiation of chemotherapy, this was still a heterogeneous population, which could have affected our immunogenicity results. Finally, we changed our inclusion criteria in study year 2, which allowed patients to enroll after 4 weeks into chemotherapy rather than once in the maintenance phase. Patients enrolled prior to the maintenance phase of chemotherapy are receiving more intense therapy and this might have affected their immune response to the vaccine in study year 2. Since more than 80% of patients were in maintenance during the study, the population was quite similar.",
