            "text": "Mining frequent itemsets from transactional databases play an important role in many data mining applications, e.g., social network mining (Jiang, Leung, Zhang, 2016, Moosavi, Jalali, Misaghian, Shamshirband, Anisi, 2017), finding gene expression patterns (Becquet, Blachon, Jeudy, Boulicaut, Gandrillon, 2001, Creighton, Hanash, 2003, Cremaschi, Carriero, Astrologo, Col, Lisa, Parolo, Bione, 2015, Mallik, Mukhopadhyay, Maulik, 2015), web log pattern mining (Diwakar Tripathia, Edlaa, 2017, Han, Cheng, Xin, Yan, 2007, Iv\u00e1ncsy, Ren\u00e1ta, Vajk, 2006, Yu, Korkmaz, 2015). In recent years, many algorithms have been proposed for efficient mining of frequent itemsets (Apiletti, Baralis, Cerquitelli, Garza, Pulvirenti, Venturini, 2017, Bodon, 2003, Burdick, Calimlim, Flannick, Gehrke, Yiu, 2005, Gan, Lin, Fournier-Viger, Chao, Zhan, 2017, Han, Pei, Yin, 2000, Kosters, Pijls, 2003, Liu, Lu, Yu, Wang, Xiao, 2003, Pei, Tung, Han, 2001, Uno, Kiyomi, Arimura, 2004, Vo, Pham, Le, Deng, 2017). These algorithms take a transactional database and support threshold (minimum itemset support) as input and mines complete set of frequent itemsets with support greater than minimum itemset support. Traditional frequent itemset mining (FIM) approach discovers only exact matching itemsets that are absolutely matched. This creates problem when the database contains missing items in transactions and may cause some implicit frequent itemsets not being discover (Yu, Li, & Wang, 2015). In the presence of missing items users face difficulties in setting suitable support threshold for mining desired itemsets. For example, if the support threshold is set too large then FIM discovers only a small number of frequent itemsets, which do not provide desirable output. On the other hand if the support threshold is set too small then FIM generates too many redundant short length frequent itemsets (Cheung, Fu, 2004, Huynh-Thi-Le, Le, Vo, Le, 2015, Saif-Ur-Rehman, Ashraf, Habib, Salam, 2016). This not only consumes large processing time but also increases the complexity of filtering interesting frequent itemsets. In both settings, the ultimate goal of mining interesting frequent itemsets is undermined.",

To mine frequent itemsets if the user gives the minimum itemset support equals to 3 then there exists no itemset with length more than 2 items (see column 2 of Table 1). The database has many short length itemsets with low support count. To discover generalized knowledge users would be interested to mine itemsets of long length with high support count. If we further analyze the database, then we can discover some long length frequent itemsets. These are not absolutely matched in transactions but have support more than 2. For example, further analysis reveals that the itemset (abcef) has itemset support 3 as the transactions 10, 30, and 50 contain four out of five items of abcef, and every single item of (abcef) is appeared in two out of three transactions. This frequent itemset mining phenomenon is interesting in terms of that it discovers generalized frequent itemsets that are not absolutely matched by slightly relaxing the notion of traditional frequent itemset. This phenomenon motivates us to develop an automatic method to mine such kind of knowledge. This task is called mining fault tolerant (FT) frequent itemsets (Pei et al., 2001).",

(Pei et al., 2001) proposed FT-Apriori algorithm for mining FT frequent itemsets from transactional databases. FT-Apriori uses candidate generation-and-test approach for mining FT frequent itemsets. Although, the performance of FT-Apriori is efficient when database is sparse and FT support thresholds are given large. However, FT-Apriori encounters difficulties and takes long processing time for dense and spare databases if the FT support thresholds are given small. We list here main limitations of FT-Apriori that do not make it an attractive solution for mining FT frequent itemsets.\u2022\nFT-Apriori is based on Apriori-like candidate generation-and-test approach. This approach is not efficient for databases having large number of items. For example, to mine complete set of FT frequent itemsets of a database with 200 items. FT-Apriori has to generate and test all the 2200 candidates.\u2022\nFT-Apriori applies bottom-up search mechanism and this enumerates each subset of itemset X before mining itemset X. This implies that in order to produce FT frequent itemsets of length Y, the algorithm must generate all subsets of Y which are 2Y, since all subsets must be frequent. This exponential complexity of FT-Apriori fundamentally restricts the algorithm to mine complete set of itemsets in a reasonable time limit.\u2022To mine FT frequent itemsets of length Y the FT-Apriori requires full scan of database multiple times for counting support of itemsets. These scans are costly when the database is large and number of candidates to be examined are numerous.\n",

FT-PatternGrowth adopts a divide-and-conquer technique and recursively projects a transactional database into a set of smaller projected transactional databases and mines FT frequent itemsets in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent items. This mines the complete set of FT frequent itemsets and substantially reduces those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the database (Han, Pei, 2014, Han, Pei, Yin, 2000, Han, Pei, Yin, Mao, 2004). The major advantage of mining FT frequent itemsets using pattern growth approach is that it removes two costly operations of Apriori heuristic: candidate generate-and-test and repeatedly scanning of database for counting support of itemsets. The first scan of database counts the support of all frequent items of length one. The second scan of database builds a compact data structure called frequent pattern (FP)-tree. Each node of FP-tree corresponds to an item which was found frequent in first scan of database. Next, all FT frequent itemsets are mined directly from this FP-tree without scanning the database multiple times. The approach traverses search space using depth first order and during traversing each node it generates FT frequent itemsets using conditional patterns and builds compacted child FP-trees for mining FT frequent itemsets of next level. We tested our approach on several benchmarks databases and found computationally efficient than FT-Apriori.",

The concept of mining proportional FT itemsets is similar to traditional FT itemsets, however, the fault tolerant factor in proportional FT itemsets is proportional to the length of itemset. Thus, the definition of proportional discovers much large number of itemsets than the FT itemset mining definition proposed in (Pei et al., 2001). Our proposed algorithm in based on the FT definition proposed in (Pei et al., 2001). Thus, the processing time of our proposed algorithm cannot be directly comparable with the algorithm proposed in (Lee & Lin, 2006).

To discover proportional FT frequent itemsets in a reasonable time Liu, Poon, 2014, Liu, Poon, 2018 proposed efficient heuristic method to mine approximation version of the itemsets. Their study showed heuristic algorithm is much faster than the exact algorithms while the error is acceptable. In all studies on mining proportional FT frequent itemsets the authors proposed algorithms by mining itemsets on the basis of Apriori-like candidate generation-and-test property. However, no effort is made how to use FP-tree structure and pattern growth for increasing the speed of counting itemset support and reducing the number of candidate itemsets.

To examine the support of itemsets of length equals to (\u03b4+1) the algorithm counts item support and itemset support directly from the conditional patterns of items stored in the FP-tree. Example: To examine whether itemset X=(bca) is a frequent itemset. The algorithm generates conditional patterns of item b, item c, and item a. The algorithm ignores the conditional patterns of other items; this is because if a branch of FP-tree does not contain any item of X then the FT factor of the branch becomes (\u03b4=3), which does not qualify (\u03b4=2). The algorithm enumerates items of X in increasing frequency order, i.e., first b, then c and then a. For X, the FP-tree generates the following set of conditional patterns.\u2022For Item b, FP-tree generates conditional patterns \u27e8efab: 1\u27e9, \u27e8efcb: 1\u27e9, and \u27e8eacb: 1\u27e9.\u2022FP-tree is again traversed for item c and the following three conditional patterns are discovered: \u27e8efc: 1\u27e9, \u27e8eac: 1\u27e9, and \u27e8fdc: 1\u27e9. If a conditional pattern (cB) is a subset of any already discovered conditional pattern (cA) of previous item, then the support of cB is subtracted from the support of cA. If the support of cB becomes zero, then the conditional pattern cB is ignored. Since conditional patterns \u27e8efc: 1\u27e9 and \u27e8eac: 1\u27e9 are subsets of conditional patterns (\u27e8efcb: 1\u27e9 and \u27e8eacb: 1\u27e9) of item b, and after subtracting the support of \u27e8efc: 1\u27e9 and \u27e8eac: 1\u27e9 from the support of conditional patterns of b, the support of both conditional patterns become zero. Thus, both patterns are removed from the conditional patterns of c. After removing two patterns, the item c contains only conditional pattern \u27e8fdc: 1\u27e9.\u2022The FP-tree is again traversed for item a and the following three conditional patterns are discovered: \u27e8efa: 2\u27e9, \u27e8ea: 1\u27e9, and \u27e8fda: 1\u27e9. The pattern \u27e8efa: 2\u27e9 is a subset of conditional pattern \u27e8efab: 1\u27e9 of item b. The support of \u27e8efa: 2\u27e9 is subtracted from the support of (\u27e8efab: 1\u27e9), which makes the support of \u27e8efa: 2\u27e9 equals to 1. The pattern \u27e8ea: 1\u27e9 is a subset of conditional pattern \u27e8eacb: 1\u27e9 of item b. The support of \u27e8ea: 1\u27e9 is subtracted from the support of (\u27e8eacb: 1\u27e9), which makes the support of \u27e8ea: 1\u27e9 equals to 0. The pattern \u27e8ea: 1\u27e9 is ignored. After removing, the item a contains two conditional patterns \u27e8efa: 1\u27e9 and \u27e8fda: 1\u27e9\u2022The three conditional patterns of b (\u27e8efcb: 1\u27e9, \u27e8efab: 1\u27e9, and \u27e8eacb: 1\u27e9), one conditional pattern of c (\u27e8fdc: 1\u27e9), and two conditional patterns of a (\u27e8efa: 1\u27e9 and \u27e8fda: 2\u27e9) are used for counting items support and itemset support. Since all items of itemset (bca) qualify item_sup\u03b4=2, and (bca) qualifies itemset support (min_sup\u03b4=3). Therefore, (bca) is a FT frequent itemset of length three.\n",

To deal with large number of transactions FT-Apriori has to generate many candidates itemsets, even those that do not exist in the database. We also found that large amount of processing time of FT-Apriori is spend on counting itemset support. This is because FT-Apriroi does not provide any functionality to compress the transactions which share a common set of items. This number of candidates itemsets becomes tremendous large when the database contains large number of frequent items. In contrast, the FT-PatternGrowth is efficient because it generates only those candidate itemsets which exist in the branches of FP-trees. This mines all FT frequent itemsets in less processing time as it substantially eliminates those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the transactions. FT-PatternGrowth provides much better speed for counting support of itemsets as it compresses transactions in the similar branches of FP-tree if they share a common set of items. This explains why FT-PatternGrowth is more efficient than FT-Apriori when the support threshold is low and when the number of transactions is large.",

Previous algorithms on mining FT frequent itemsets are based on Apriori-like candidate generation-and-test approach. These algorithms generate many candidate itemsets including those that do not exist in the database and require multiple scans of database for counting the support of each candidate itemsets. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for mining FT frequent itemsets using pattern growth approach (FT-PatternGrowth). FT-PatternGrowth adopts a divide-and-conquer technique and recursively projects a transactional database into a set of smaller projected transactional databases and mines FT frequent itemsets in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent items. This mines the complete set of FT frequent itemsets in less processing time and substantially reduces those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the database. FT-PatternGrowth also stores the transactional database in a highly condensed much smaller data structure called FT-FP-tree. The support of candidate itemsets and the support of items are calculated directly from the FT-FP-tree without scanning the database multiple times. This reduces the processing time of algorithm for counting support of itemsets. Our experiments on benchmark databases indicate mining FT frequent itemsets using pattern growth approach is highly efficient than Apriori-like algorithms.",
