In contrast, SCY995 did not significantly affect on NTCP-mediated bile acid uptake (Fig. 5) . Similar binding pocket-mediated inhibition were observed in the competition kinetics analysis of preS1 binding assay: Inhibitory effect of CsA, SCY446, and SCY995 can be overcome by addition of increasing amount of fluorescent-labeled preS1 probe ( Supplementary Fig. 9C ), suggesting that cyclosporins inhibited NTCP-preS1 binding in a competitive manner. The above evidences suggest that CsA or its derivative SCY446 bind to the NTCP interface that contains the bile acid pocket, but SCY995 interaction does not involve the bile acid pocket. As SCY995 competitively inhibited NTCP-preS1 binding, which is likely to contain the bile acid pocket and its peripheral region in NTCP, we speculate that SCY995",
