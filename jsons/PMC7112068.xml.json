However, most of the HW incinerators were built in the serious situation for dealing HW generated during Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), thus many of the facilities were old and improperly designed and usually lacks emission control system. Currently, many hospital-scale incinerators in some small cities are still operating although China EPA has closed some on-site small incinerators which pose a potential threat to the environment. In recent years, several large-scale and properly designed HW incinerators, equipped with well-maintained air pollution control devices (APCDs), have been built in large cities.",

Meanwhile, hospital waste was found to generate higher amount of PAHs compared to coal and municipal solid waste (MSW) because it contains high amount of plastic and rubber (gloves, containers, bags, packaging) (Levendis et al., 2001). Mastral (1999) concluded that such wastes promote more PAHs formation as compared to coal combustion at the same combustion conditions. Thus HW incineration is an important emission source of PAHs, especially small-scale incinerators which lack emission control system.",

However, in the combustion processes, PAHs adsorbed on solid particles can also cause serious pollution when they evaporate into the atmosphere (Wild et al., 1992, Liu et al., 2000), as most of the PAHs are associated with particulate material and the PAHs either remain in the bottom ash or are removed from the flue gases by the precipitators to form fly ash. Lee et al. (2002) and Wheatley and Sadhra (2004) reported PAH levels and concentrations in clinical waste incineration bottom and fly ash in Taiwan and UK. To the best knowledge of the authors, however, only limited reports are available on PAHs content in various HW incinerator ashes in China, though thermal treatment of HW has dramatically increased after the outbreak of SARS.",

The GC oven temperature was programmed from 50 \u00b0C held for 2 min followed by an increase to 300 \u00b0C at a rate of 6 \u00b0C/min, where it was held for 5 min. The injector and detector temperatures were 300 \u00b0C and 230 \u00b0C, respectively. Quantization was performed using the five-point calibration curve for individual components.",

This could attribute to the operating conditions of this type incinerator, which are suitable for PAHs formation. For example, the operating temperature in HWI-I is generally below 800 \u00b0C, while that in HWI-II is below 400 \u00b0C.

It was also much higher than those reported in literatures, i.e. 0 and 47.0 mg kg\u2212 1 (Lee et al., 2002, Wheatley and Sadhra, 2004). The prominent species in the two types of fly ashes are quite different. Nine PAH species tend to predominate in ash samples from HWI-III, i.e., benzo [g,h,i] perylene, fluoranthene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, phenanthrene, benzo[k]fluoranthese, chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene in descending order. While naphthalene is the most abundant species in samples from HWI-IV, the percentage of this species to total PAHs is in the range of 23.33% to 57.95%. These results indicate that fly ashes from medium-scale incinerators (HWI-III) contain much higher amounts of PAHs than from large-scale incinerators (HWI-IV). This could be partly attributed to the different exact operating temperatures of the two incinerators. Although the designed incineration temperatures were similar for the two types of incinerators (Table 1), the real running temperatures in HWI-III were much lower than in HWI-IV because of the structural difference between the two incinerators. First, the color of the ash from HWI-IV was grey while that from HWI-III was black, indicating uncompleted burning in HWI-III. Second, the loss of on ignition (weight percent at 600 \u00b0C for 3 h) of the two types of ashes were quite different, i.e. 20% for HWI-III ash and 3% respectively for HWI-III ash, indicating that HWI-IV ash contained much more unburned organic matter.",

It can be seen that the mean \u2211carcinogenic PAHs of the ashes are all above the limits for soil use. In particular, fly ash from HWI-III exceeded the limits of the three countries for about 100 times. Generally, bottom ashes are regarded as less toxic waste materials since they contain less toxic heavy metals and the leachability of which are much lower compared with fly ashes.

            "text": "The results of this study demonstrated that PAHs generated from HW incineration was greatly affected by incinerator types. Among the three types of incinerators, two medium-scale incinerators generated high levels of PAHs, with mean total PAH values of 22.50 and 198.9 mg kg\u2212 1, much higher than PAHs in ashes from large-scale (4.16 mg kg\u2212 1), and even small-scale (16.43 mg kg\u2212 1) incinerators. Although bottom ash has not been classified as a hazardous material, according to this study, bottom ashes from HW incinerator, especially from medium-scale and small-scale incinerators, contained high levels of PAHs thus need special treatment before landfill. Of the PAH species, the mean \u2211carcinogenic PAHs in the examined ashes are all above the limits for soil application, especially for ashes from two medium-scale incinerators, which exceed the limit values for 100 times, suggesting that these ashes must be pre-treated before they are disposed by landfill. Organic matter content was found to have a positive relationship (R\n2 = 0.88) with the total PAH thus has a potential to be used as an indicator for PAH levels in HW ashes. Furthermore, it was found that PAH concentrations in the ashes correlate highly with some metallic elements either positively (e.g. Fe, Ti, Mg) or negatively (Ca), indicating that these elements may promote or prevent PAHs formation during HW combustion.",
