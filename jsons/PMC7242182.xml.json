We have previously calculated the cost of PDC at our centre at \u00a3155 per visit4 and for our 31 patients this translates to an approximately saving of \u00a39000 per month just on PDC costs. If 30 patients each month could be identified for remote monitoring, this could potentially lead to an annual saving of more than \u00a3110,000. In addition, the estimated cost-saving by converting the mode of anaesthesia from GA to WALANT has been shown to cause a 70% reduction.5\n",
