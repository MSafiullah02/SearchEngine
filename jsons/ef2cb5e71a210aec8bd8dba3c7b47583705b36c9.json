Clinicians must care for patients with a highly communicable disease while protecting themselves from a potentially lethal disease. Anesthesiologists are at particularly high risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 because airway management, particularly tracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation through a mask, and management of tracheostomy tubes, causes widespread aerosolization of the virus (Table 1) . 1, 2 Though the virus appears to have its most damaging clinical effects in adult patients, infection does occur in children. [3] [4] [5] [6] Indeed, in the Chinese experience, asymptomatic transmission of the virus from children to health care workers (HCWs) emerged as a significant risk. 4, 5 How to manage the pediatric airway in patients who may or may not be symptomatic is the focus of this report. Further many routine pre-COVID-19 practices, such as mask induction of general anesthesia in anxious, crying, and agitated children or carrying them into the operating room (OR), may be less desirable because of the risk of viral exposure to the clinical staff.",

Therefore, we sought to develop consensus guidelines from airway experts in pediatric anesthesiology. The Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative (PeDI-C; pediregistry.org) is a special interest group of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (pedsanesthesia.org). The mission of PeDI-C is to advance the safety of pediatric airway management by facilitating multicenter research, quality improvement, and education. PeDI-C has led several multicenter studies on pediatric airway management. 7-10 PeDI-C currently includes 35 hospitals from 6 countries and 10 additional hospitals that are being onboarded. The more than 100 PeDI-C members include many internationally recognized experts in pediatric airway management. PeDI-C hosts biannual in-person meetings and communicates year-round using an online active chat group on WhatsApp (https://www.whatsapp.com). Members discuss real-time management of difficult intubation cases and disseminate clinical best practices through the forum. Average messages increased from 4 per day in March 2019 to 77 per day during March 2020. The surge in messaging highlighted the global need for guidance about airway management during this COVID-19 pandemic. To help address this need, PeDI-C leadership organized a webinar to generate consensus guidelines about airway management during aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) in pediatric anesthesia.",

We used a modified nominal group technique (NGT). The classic NGT technique yields prompt results but requires a face-to-face meeting. 11 Due to the travel restrictions and requirement for social distancing during the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic, PeDI-C held a virtual NGT. PeDI-C leadership advertised the virtual meeting on its WhatsApp channel. Participation was voluntary and open to all members. Zoom (https://www.zoom.us), an online video conferencing service for the virtual NGT, was used, allowing members to interact using audio and video. J.E.F. moderated the session. Preplanned topics for discussion included appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), conduct of anesthesia, and management of at-risk care teams. Forty-four pediatric anesthesiologists and one otolaryngologist from 33 institutions attended the virtual NGT (Supplemental Digital Content 1, Material 1, http:// links.lww.com/AA/D84). We analyzed audio, chat messages, and video recordings to identify themes and compared these themes to notes taken in real time during the meeting by 3 PeDI-C members (J.E.F., P.C., and C.T.M.). We summarized the identified themes and shared them with PeDI-C membership for review, further input, and refinement (Table 2) . Additionally, an investigator (C.T.M.) conducted a literature search using Ovid Medline, PubMed, and Google on March 24 and 25, 2020, using the search terms \"COVID-19,\" \"SARS-CoV-2,\" \"children,\" AND \"pediatrics\" to identify publications relevant to airway management in children with COVID-19.",

This training is commendable; however, PeDI-C identified the need for context-specific simulation (ie, simulation that reflects their specific role in the health care team). 12, 13 For example, anesthesia clinicians should design simulation sessions focused on intubating and extubating COVID-19 patients in full appropriate PPE while minimizing exposure to and spread of the virus in the perioperative environment. Similarly, otolaryngologists would simulate performing an aerosolizing procedure with a clinical team while also minimizing OR exposure using various barrier techniques and PPE.",

            "text": "PeDI-C agreed that clinicians who are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 should be protected from clinical exposure. 14 Some suggestions included delegating these at-risk clinicians to staff telemedicine clinics or contribute to scholarly and administrative tasks while maintaining adequate physical distancing. PeDI-C discussed the importance of PPE for anesthesia clinicians; specifically, there was consensus that airway manipulation, such as endotracheal intubation or extubation, is AGMPs and therefore requires maximum protection. 1, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] The group also acknowledged that during times of crisis, such as the current pandemic, institutions might have PPE shortages. Several members emphasized that although equipment shortages are essential to consider, the highest priority should be the safety of care teams. Prioritizing the safety of HCWs can maximize the delivery of care for patients during a pandemic. PPE supplies are becoming available from manufacturers, donations, and release from national strategic stockpiles; however, clinicians are impossible to replace if quarantined, severely ill, or, worse yet, dead. PeDI-C felt that centers should err on the side of overprotection rather than underprotection. Nearly 10% of HCWs in Italy and 14% in Spain have contracted COVID-19 with associated morbidity and mortality. 20 Inadequate PPE, deeper lung penetration of aerosolized viral particles, and a high burden of PeDI-C recognized that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 could shed the virus asymptomatically, even in stool, and infect others. [21] [22] [23] [24] A case report of an asymptomatic well infant reported high viral loads for 16 days. 5 Anywhere from 18% to 31% of COVID-19-positive passengers (mostly adults) isolated on the Diamond Cruise ship never developed symptoms. Early periods of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to lower levels of sensitivity on screening tests. 25 Therefore, PeDI-C recommends appropriate PPE (N95 and face shield and powered, air-purifying respirator [PAPR]) for AGMPs in all children in areas with high community spread. PeDI-C also recognized the importance of balancing the need for ideal PPE for AGMPs against the current global shortage of PPE. A PPE coach should be available to ensure correct donning and doffing of PPE. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers educational videos of proper donning and doffing technique at https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/ hcp/ppe-training/index.html.",

PeDI-C recommends using video laryngoscopy for all intubations, if available, to reduce the laryngoscopist's proximity to the patient's airway. 29 The most experienced laryngoscopist should attempt tracheal intubation to minimize laryngoscopy time and the number of attempts. Open suctioning may create aerosols, and an in-line closed suction system is preferred. 1, 17, 30 If clinically appropriate, patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) should be intubated in the ICU (preferably in a negative pressure room) before transfer to the OR. PeDI-C felt that a supraglottic airway device with a good seal was acceptable in some cases. A simulated cough in a manikin model with a supraglottic airway device in place showed minimal aerosol dispersion (Supplemental Digital Second-generation supraglottic airway devices have higher leak pressures than first-generation masks and should be considered. 31 PeDI-C agreed that the least desirable approaches were high-or low-flow nasal cannula or bag-mask ventilation, though these techniques may be unavoidable at times. A simple oxygen mask placed on top of a nasal cannula may reduce the risk of aerosol dispersion (Supplemental Digital Content 3, Video 2, http://links.lww.com/AA/D86). PeDI-C recommended avoiding techniques that bring the clinician's face or stethoscope near the patient to verify leak pressures for endotracheal tube (ETT) and supraglottic airway (SGA). Clinicians can use the ventilator's measurements of expired and inspired tidal volume and handheld manometers to titrate cuff inflation. Wireless stethoscopes and point-of-care ultrasound can be used to confirm bilateral ventilation of the lungs. A \"high-quality\" viral filter should be placed between the breathing circuit and the patient's airway and another one at the end of the expiratory limb at the connection to the anesthesia machine as illustrated at https://www.apsf.org/faq-on-anesthesia-machineuse-protection-and-decontamination-during-thecovid-19-pandemic/#machine.",

Many of the recommendations described above for tracheal intubation of normal airways apply to difficult airways as well. An airway team should be assembled, and all equipment should be setup in the OR and checked. The team should consider a just-in-time review before beginning airway management. The clinician with the most experience with the selected airway device should perform the tracheal intubation. PeDI-C ranked difficult airway management approaches as follows: video laryngoscopy as the primary technique followed by fiberoptic intubation through a supraglottic airway device, combined video laryngoscopy and fiberoptic bronchoscopy and finally freehand fiberoptic. Oral fiberoptic intubation is preferred over nasal fiberoptic intubation and minimizes passive oxygenation as tolerated. Hypoxia can be addressed with intermittent 2-hand mask ventilation to maintain a good seal and low tidal volumes. If safe to do so, consider administering a neuromuscular blocking agent after IV induction. Sugammadex should be immediately available to antagonize the neuromuscular blocking agent if needed. If warranted, perform mask ventilation with low tidal volumes using a 2-person technique to maintain a good seal. If nasal fiberoptic intubation is required, using an endoscopy mask (Supplemental Digital Content 1, Material 3, http:// links.lww.com/AA/D84) is considered. Endoscopy masks have a diaphragm that seals around the fiberoptic scope but allows the tracheal tube to be advanced into the airway. It may be prudent to call early for personnel and equipment for a surgical airway. Prolonged attempts at intubation may be associated with increased aerosolization of the virus.",

One study compared the efficacy of N95 respirators to medical masks in preventing HCWs from acquiring influenza and other viral respiratory infections. They randomly assigned 2862 HCWs to N95 or a medical mask and found no difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza infections between the 2 groups: 207 (8.2%) in the N95 group, and 193 (7.2%) in the medical mask group (difference, 1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22120.5% to 2.5%; P = .18). 41 Clinicians should not extrapolate these data to COVID-19 for 2 reasons. First, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is more contagious than influenza. The R0, also known as the basic reproductive number, is a measure of how contagious an infectious disease is, and indicates the expected number of people who will get the disease from an infected individual. The R0 of influenza is 1.2, while that of COVID-19 is estimated to be between 2 and 3. 42 Second, SARS-CoV-2 may aerosolize more readily than influenza and remain airborne longer. 43 Clinicians should err on the side of overprotection in asymptomatic patients until more rigorous data are available in children. Fortunately, new data from Italy and China suggest that the pediatric burden of the disease might be low (2, 4) . Data from the Virtual pediatric intensive care unit systems (www.myvps.org), a collaboration of 135 North American Pediatric Intensive Care Units, indicate that of 609 patients tested, 30 were COVID-19 positive as of March 29, 2020. These data should be considered in the context of limited testing and exponential spread, which means a low disease prevalence can change rapidly. We caution clinicians not to lower their guard because of a perceived low burden of disease in children.",

Some centers use COVID-19 screening tests to determine the type of PPE for AGMPs, reserving N95 masks for COVID-19 patients and standard surgical masks for negative patients. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for COVID-19 to determine PPE use in a limited resource setting makes sense. However, sensitivity for detection of COVID-19 can vary based on how the sample was obtained, the duration from infection to testing, and how the laboratory performed the test. Further, the potential for false negatives should be recognized and clinicians should not be falsely reassured by a negative test. If high-sensitivity testing for COVID-19 is negative in the child, PPE may not be required. Another area of concern is the potential for asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 from HCWs to patients. It may become necessary for all HCWs to undergo COVID-19 testing to prevent nosocomial infection.",

Although we searched multiple online repositories and search engines for articles, publication delays could have made some reports unavailable to us at the time of this writing, and not all articles from the global medical community are available in the repositories we queried. Information is evolving quickly during this pandemic, and PeDI-C recognizes that an update to this document may be warranted as we learn more. Most importantly, each hospital will need to adapt these guidelines based on local regulations, availability of equipment, and the prevalence of the disease.
