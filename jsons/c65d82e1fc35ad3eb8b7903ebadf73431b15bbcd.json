Their aim is to ensure better protection and resilience of infrastructures, as well as an effective response to computer security incidents, whether at individual, organisational or even national levels (Cichonski et al., 2012; CMM, 2016; NIST, 2018) . They mainly adopt a technical and information technology risk management vision, but also incorporate legal or social aspects intrinsic to these problems. The inclusion of forensic science within incident response practices was also considered early in these models (Kent et al., 2006) . At the same time, a \"digital forensics\" community was emerging, supporting the detection, collection and management of digital evidence in judicial processes (Pollitt, 2010) . Beyond this traditional scope of forensic science, a forensic analysis approach has also proven to be essential to decipher the modus operandi of the attackers, and thus gather the knowledge to better protect an infrastructure (Casey and Nikkel, 2020) . Cybersecurity and digital forensics are now routinely implemented as specialized departments in private and public organizations or as services. Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) is considered to be a sub-domain, which is involved in particular when a rapid response to incidents is required.",

Although DFIR processes, practices, and tools play an important role in dealing with cybercrime, they are not sufficient for dealing with new forms of high volume crimes enabled by the technological infrastructures that have become ubiquitous in everyday life (Loveday, 2018) . A wide variety of online frauds are among these crimes that have become part of a digitally transformed society in which human factors play the central role. The coronavirus has shown how suddenly new online modus operandi can appear when the social context changes and people's routine activities are disrupted. 1 Online fraud is therefore difficult to model and mitigate entirely using a DFIR approach. It is preferable to integrate a strong crime analysis component bringing new insights from criminology. A new stream of criminological research is attempting to better delimit the size of the problem and its forms (Button, Lewis and Tapley, 2009; Reep-van den Bergh and Junger, 2018) , to adapt existing theories in an attempt to explain them ( Leukfeldt and Yar, 2016) , to characterize the phenomenon more specifically ( Leukfeldt et al., 2017; Wall, 2010) , study it from the victim's perspective ( Button et al., 2014a; Button et al., 2014b; Cross, 2018; Whitty, 2019) or consider the kinds of possible responses (Holt and Bossler, 2016) .",

Traditional high-volume property crimes that cross jurisdictions (e.g. burglaries or all sorts of thefts and frauds) were increasing dramatically during the eighties, and have required a strong reaction. It took a long time to gradually define new strategies and new policing style. The solutions found have been more proactive and intelligence-led (i.e., not prosecution-focused), incorporating crime analysis models based on crime concentrations, opportunities theories in criminology and the use of physical traces. Knowledge about what works and what does not work in terms of crime disruption or harm reduction has also increased considerably during this period (Ratcliffe, 2016; Ribaux et al., 2006) . By analogy, we are now in the same situation with online frauds than in the past with traditional high-volume crimes. The difficulties in prosecuting globalized crimes should be an incentive to find alternative solutions in the same spirit. It is necessary to develop a new, wellbalanced, interdisciplinary proactive vision integrating digital traces and their interpretation at the heart of the process (Rossy and Ribaux, 2020) .",
