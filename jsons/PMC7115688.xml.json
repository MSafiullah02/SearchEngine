            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory disease that was originally reported in Asia at the beginning of 2003. Shortly afterwards, it was rapidly spread to North America and Europe. Threatened by such a disease, scientists in all areas are devoted to the research for finding the treatment of SARS. Cumulative evidences indicate that a previously unrecognized coronavirus is the culprit of SARS [4], [7], [10]. It is also known that the process of cleaving the SARS-CoV polyproteins by a special proteinase, the so-called SARS coronavirus main proteinase (SARS-CoV Mpro, 3CLpro), is a key step for the replication of SARS-CoV. The functional importance of the Mpro in the viral life cycle makes it an attractive target for developing drugs directly against this new disease.",

            "text": "According to the\u201clock-and-key\u201dmechanism in enzymology, an octapeptide cleavable by the SARS proteinase must have a good fit for binding to its active site [8]. Thus, the cleavable peptide, after some chemical modification, can be converted to a competent inhibitor against the enzyme, as elaborated by Chou [6] in the \u201cdistorted key\u201d theory. In view of this, the knowledge about what kind of peptide sequences can be cleaved by 3CLpro is important in designing effective inhibitors against 3CLpro and potential drugs for SARS therapy [17]. The protease-susceptible sites in proteins usually extend to an octapeptide [5], [8], [15], [16], as generally formulated by P\u22124P\u22123P\u22122P\u22121\n \u2193 P1P2P3P4 with the scissile bond located between the subsites P\u22121 and P1\n[6]. The SARS coronavirus enzyme and several viral proteinases exhibit Gln \u2193 (Ser, Ala, and Gly) specificity [4], [10]. The octapeptide AVLQSGFR selected in this paper was taken from the paper by Chou et al. [10]. These authors had done studies of docking the octapeptide to SARS-CoV Mpro based on the three-dimensional structure of SARS coronavirus main proteinase obtained by Anand et al. [4] through a homologous approach. The binding results obtained through docking study [10] and structural bioinformatics [7] show that the octapeptide AVLQSGFR is bound to the SARS proteinase through six hydrogen bonds. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV Mpro has also been determined later by Yang et al. [18], whose results have confirmed the above analysis.",

Those residues involved in forming the hydrogen bonds from the enzyme are: Arg-40, His-41, Phe-185, Asp-187, and Gln-189. The interaction is so strong that the octapeptide naturally becomes an ideal competitive inhibitor for the SARS proteinase [1], [2], [3], [9].

The EC50 for AVLQSGFR we recorded shows the lowest concentration among those existing compounds and a higher selective antiviral activity (SI > 3704) against SARS-CoV. This suggests that AVLQSGFR can serve as a starting entity in the course of discovering effective drug candidates for the treatment of SARS.",
