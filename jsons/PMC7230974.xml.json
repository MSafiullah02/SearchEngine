In humans, two main types of stem cells can be distinguished, namely, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and adult stem cells (ASCs). ESCs are isolated from the inner cell mass of the pre-implantation blastocyst and are considered pluripotent, as they have the ability to differentiate into cells of all three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. However, their acquisition involves embryo destruction, which raises serious ethical concerns. Moreover, the possibility to utilize ESCs in a clinical environment seems to be limited, as they may form teratomas after the transplantation, and immune rejection may occur [1,2].",

In contrast, stem cell properties have been discovered in cells that are normally not considered stem cells, such as ovarian granulosa cells [7,8] or buccal pouch mucosal cells [9]. Recently, the perinatal tissues, such as the umbilical cord, have become of interest in regards to cellular therapies; because they are typically discarded after birth, their utilization as an MSC source is not ethically controversial and their collection does not involve a painful procedure. Moreover, it is suggested that MSCs from such neonatal tissues may have higher stemness potential than other MSCs [10]. Apart from this, contrary to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), they do not exhibit contact-inhibited cell growth and their proliferation rate is higher than for BM-MSCs [11].",

The induction of transcription factors, such as Oct-3/4 (Octamer-binding transcription factor 3/4), Sox2 (SRY-box transcription factor 2), Klf4 (Kruppel-like factor 4), or c-Myc (MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor), results in gaining pluripotency features by these cells [12]. Such genetic reprogramming involves a genome-wide change of DNA methylation and histone modifications, such as changes in H3K4me2 pattern [13]. However, similar to ESCs, their clinical use may pose a threat for patients, as they are prone to form teratomas in vivo [12]. Another important consideration is the fact that such iPSCs may inherit epigenetic memory from the donor tissue, which would affect their properties [14]. This was exemplified in the study by Bar-Nur et al. [15], who generated iPSCs from human pancreatic islet beta cells, and revealed that such cells maintained an open chromatin structure at key beta-cell genes, and also exhibited a unique DNA methylation signature, compared with ESCs.",

It starts to develop at day 26 of gestation from the yolk sac and allantois, and its main function is providing the blood supply for the fetus, as well as biological waste removal [17,18,19]. Such bidirectional blood flow between the mother and the child is established by the end of the fifth week of pregnancy [20], and occurs through three umbilical vessels\u2014two arteries and one vein (see Figure 1)\u2014which comprise tunica intima and tunica media layers, while lacking tunica adventitia.

The umbilical vessels are embedded in this gelatinous tissue, and its function is of particular significance, as it prevents vessels from compression and torsion; thus, it plays a vital role in maintaining bi-directional blood transfer between the mother and the fetus, which is critical for proper fetal development [24]. Because Wharton\u2019s jelly is classified as a connective tissue, it is abundant in extracellular matrix, composed of glycosaminoglycans (mainly hyaluronic acid), as well as different types of collagen [25]. Apart from the amorphous ground substance, Wharton\u2019s jelly contains the fibroblast-like connective tissue cells and occasional mast cells [26,27]. Contrary to other species, such as pig or horse, Wharton\u2019s jelly in humans lacks neural tissue, as well as other blood or lymph vessels [18,28].",

Moreover, the umbilical cord epithelial cells share certain features with both the fetal epidermis and the amniotic epithelium, which is not surprising, as the umbilical cords connects the amnion to the fetal skin. Therefore, the morphological differences between the aforementioned epithelias are not distinctive [31,32]. On the other hand, the umbilical epithelium is thought to be capable of stratification or keratinization, which distinguishes it from the amniotic epithelium [31,32]. Similar to the cells obtained from other parts of the umbilical cord, umbilical epithelial cells exhibit properties characteristic for mesenchymal stem cells, such as the expression of Oct-4, Nanog, SSEA-4 (Stage-specific embryonic antigen 4), CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105 (Endoglin), and others, as well as the ability to differentiate into adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages [33].",

The division of the umbilical cord into distinct zones was further expanded by Can et al. [26], who distinguished surface epithelium, subamniotic stroma, clefts, intervascular stroma (classically regarded as Wharton\u2019s jelly), perivascular stroma, and vessels. It is, however, suggested, that the cells contained in the perivascular stroma are derived from Wharton\u2019s jelly, as there is no obvious demarcation between these two regions [16]. Therefore, all the stromal tissue below the umbilical cord lining to the umbilical vessels, comprising subamniotic stroma, clefts, intervascular stroma, and perivascular stroma, is considered Wharton\u2019s jelly [28], which is illustrated in Figure 1.",

[35] revealed that these cells also possess the features of muscle cells, and therefore they are not typical fibroblasts. Wharton\u2019s jelly-derived cells described by these authors were of fusiform or stellate shape; their cytoplasm was acidophilic and the nuclei was oval or elongated. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that these cells were positive for both actin and non-muscle myosin, which are proteins known for their contractile properties. Moreover, their level in Wharton\u2019s jelly fibroblasts was similar to those observed in smooth muscle cells [35]. These cells from Wharton\u2019s jelly were positive for two members of the intermediate filament protein family, namely, desmin, which is one of the earliest myogenic markers in the heart and somites [35,36], and vimentin, a protein characteristic for cells of mesenchymal origin, such as fibroblasts [35,37]. Because the cells present in Wharton\u2019s jelly possess features of both fibroblasts and muscle cells, they have been named myofibroblasts, which were initially reported to participate in wound contraction [38]. However, their mitochondrial content is not as abundant as in typical smooth muscle cells [27], and it is hypothesized that they are derived from fibroblasts rather than muscle cells [35].",

Moreover, the differentiation of stromal cells occurs in a timely manner during gestation, as in the first and second trimester of pregnancy, the cells were less differentiated, meaning that their cytoskeleton expression pattern was less complex [25]. These findings were later confirmed by Kobayashi et al.

Therefore, it is assumed that the myofibroblasts are involved in synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix protein (such as collagen) [27]. The extracellular matrix of Wharton\u2019s jelly is rich in loosely arranged collagen fibers, whereas the elastic fibers are absent [41]. The collagen fibers become more abundant and oriented circularly around the umbilical vessels. Most of the collagen fibers are composed of type I collagen. However, as demonstrated by Sobolewski et al., there is also a relatively high level of type III collagen and a lower amount of type V collagen. About 1% of total Wharton\u2019s jelly collagen remained unidentified in the aforementioned study [42]. However, it was hypothesized that it might be type VII collagen, expressed predominantly by epithelial cells [42], which was in agreement with earlier studies reporting its expression in cultured Wharton\u2019s jelly stromal cells [43]. Apart from the collagen fibers, there is also a microfibrillar network present in Wharton\u2019s jelly extracellular matrix, composed of fibrillin and type VI collagen [25,44].",

The minimal criteria for defining multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells include plastic adherence in standard culture conditions; expression of specific surface antigens, namely, CD105, CD73 and CD90, while not expressing CD45, CD34, CD14, CD11b (Integrin alpha M), CD79\u03b1, CD19, and HLA-II by at least 95% of the cell population; as well as the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts [46]. MSCs were isolated for the first time from the bone marrow by Friedenstein et al. [3] and, subsequently, from a number of adult tissues. The isolation of the cells from the umbilical cords may be performed with the use of two different methods, namely, explant method or enzymatic digestion, as illustrated in Figure 2. The explant method involves mechanical tissue mincing followed by placing the tissue at the substrate/tissue interface, which results in the cell outgrowth on the plastic surface. The enzymatic digestion method requires an additional step of fragmented tissue incubation in enzymatic solution before the transfer to the culture dishes [47].",

[52] were the first to report immunomodulatory properties of these cells in vitro, demonstrating that they suppress rat splenocyte and human peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation and do not stimulate proliferation of allogeneic or xenogeneic immune cells. Moreover, this study indicated that WJ-MSCs produce HLA-G6, which is an immunosuppressive form of human leukocyte antigen, inhibiting the cytolytic activity of NK cells, while not expressing immune response-related antigens involved in T lymphocyte activation, such as CD40, CD80, or CD86 [52]. The previously mentioned study by Zhou et al. [75] confirmed these findings, indicating that WJ-MSCs inhibit proliferation of both mouse splenocytes and human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Such an effect was obtained when WJ-MSCs were co-cultured with immune cells or when only WJ-MSCs culture supernatant was used. Therefore, it was hypothesized that WJ-MSCs inhibit these cells\u2019 proliferation both via direct cell-to-cell interaction and soluble factors. Moreover, after co-culture, the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 (Transforming growth factor \u03b21) and IFN-\u03b3 (Interferon \u03b3) by lymphocytes was reduced [75]. Kara\u00f6z [76], on the other hand, demonstrated upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes, such as BCL2L10 (Bcl-2-like protein 10), BAK1 (Bcl-2-like protein 7), and BIK (Bcl-2-interacting killer), after WJ-MSC and T cell co-culture, with simultaneous decrease in anti-apoptotic genes\u2019 (BCL-2, BIRC3 (Baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3)) expression, suggesting WJ-MSCs\u2019 apoptotic properties towards activated T cells. Deng et al. [77] reported that mesenchymal stem cells isolated from the umbilical cord secrete IL-6 (Interleukin 6), which enables them to instruct dendritic cells to acquire tolerogenic phenotypes. Other soluble factors secreted by MSCs that are involved in immunoregulation include TGF-\u03b21, IL-10 (Interleukin 10), HGF (Hepatocyte growth factor), PGE2 (Prostaglandin E2), IDO (Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase), galectin-1, or HLA-G5 [52,78] Additionally, Donders et al. reported that WJ-MSCs exhibit an upregulated expression of anti-inflammatory molecules such as CD200 or PD-L1 (Programmed death ligand 1) [79].",

In the first study, the rats were injected with 6-hydroxydopamine to the medial forebrain bundle, which led to motor abnormalities similar to those seen in PD. The tested group was transplanted with approximately 1000 WJ-MSCs and received no immunosuppressive therapy. After 4 weeks, a significant decrease in apomorphine-induced rotations (which indicate motor deficits in hemiparkinsonian rats) was observed in the tested group compared to the control. A possible explanation of such results has been proposed, namely, dopaminergic neurons may have been saved from degeneration by growth and neurotrophic factors secreted by WJ-MSCs. Importantly, the cells transplanted into normal rats did not cause either immune rejection response or tumors [81]. The other previously mentioned authors, however, differentiated WJ-MSCs into dopaminergic neurons in vitro before the transplantation into the rat stratum damaged by 6-hydroxydopamine. Similar to the results obtained by Weiss et al., Fu et al. observed significant improvement in the rotational behavior in the transplanted group compared to the control [82]. Taken together, these results provide a promising alternative for Parkinson\u2019s disease therapy and management. However, further studies have to be performed to assess possible side effects.",

After the intrathecal transplantation of WJ-MSCs into rats with spinal cord injury, in several studies, the observed effects were similar, namely, an improved locomotor recovery and higher amount of spared gray matter compared to the controls [10,83,84]. Krupa et al. [83] tested two dosages of cells (0.5 M and 1.5 M), which were administered one to three times in weekly intervals. The results indicated that the effects of treatment are dose-dependent, as 1.5 M of cells provided a better outcome than 0.5 M, and this was enhanced by repeated application [83]. Chudickova et al. [84] compared the results of therapy with WJ-MSCs or their culture media (CM), as beneficial effects of MSCs are exerted mainly in a paracrine manner. Compared to the treatment with stem cells, the use of culture medium improved axonal sprouting and reduced the number of reactive astrocytes; therefore, the use of CM instead of the cells themselves seems to be an attractive alternative for spinal injury treatment [84]. Mohamadi et al. [10] focused on the molecular aspects of WJ-MSCs\u2019 anti-inflammatory potential. They found that stem cell administration caused a decrease in expression of inflammasome complex components, illustrating an anti-inflammatory potential of WJ-MSCs [10].",

Tsai et al. [88] injected WJ-MSCs directly into the livers of rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis, resulting in a reduction in inflammation and collagen content. This inflammatory reduction was due to the secretory activity of WJ-MSCs rather than their differentiation into hepatocytes, as they did not express either human albumin or \u03b1-fetoprotein [88]. The ability of WJ-MSCs to stimulate tissue regeneration has been studied in the SCID (severe combined immunodeficient) mouse model of skin injury [89]. The cells collected from the human umbilical cord were seeded onto decellularized amniotic membrane scaffold and then grafted onto the injured skin, which resulted in improvement of biomechanical properties of the regenerated skin, as well as in reduced scar formation and better healing abilities in general [89].",

(NCT01291329) [96], 116 patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction received intracoronary injection of WJ-MSCs or placebo to evaluate safety and efficacy of such a treatment. In the tested group, a reduction in myocardial infarct size and improved heart function was observed when compared to the control, and left ventricular adverse remodeling was prevented. Moreover, no adverse effects such as teratoma formation or immune rejection after cell transplant were reported [96]. In the case of previously mentioned amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (NCT02881476) [97], a group of 43 patients received WJ-MSCs once, twice, or three times, within a 2 month interval. The cells were suspended in autologous cerebrospinal fluid and administered intrathecally at the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar region. The aim of this study was to examine whether such a therapy would be safe and well tolerated by patients with ALS; no serious adverse events, apart from a headache in one case, were reported. Therefore, the researchers concluded that intrathecal injections of WJ-MSCs are safe for patients with ALS, and other outcomes of this treatment are being currently analyzed [97].",

The observed results included an increase in the number of circulating and central memory CD4 T cells and the production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, which caused general improvement in immune reconstitution.

            "text": "Another four studies concerned autoimmune diseases, however, the stem cells used in three of these studies were obtained from the whole umbilical cord to treat the active and refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (NCT01741857) [99], neuromyelitis optica (NCT01364246) [100], or active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (NCT01547091) [101]. Wang et al. [99] administered MSCs from the umbilical cord intravenously, in a weekly interval, to 40 patients with lupus. After a 12 month follow-up, the survival rate was 92.5% and the condition of the remaining patients significantly improved, according to SLEDAI (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index) and BILAG (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group) scores [99]. Such a result was explained by the secretion of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by MSCs from the umbilical cord, which led to T cell proliferation suppression [102]. In case of rheumatoid arthritis, a group of 136 patients received a treatment with MSCs from the umbilical cord injected intravenously, alongside anti-rheumatic drugs. The therapy resulted in decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6, and an increased percentage of regulatory T cells in peripheral blood, compared to the control, which led to significant remission of the disease [101]. However, it has been suggested that both treatments should be repeated after 6 months, as the clinical benefits declined after that time period [99,101]. MSCs from the umbilical cord were also used to treat neuromyelitis optica in five patients, who received intravenous and intrathecal injections of stem cells four times in weekly intervals. During an 18 month follow up, four patients exhibited an improvement in signs and symptoms, as well as reduced relapse frequencies, which was hypothesized as being the result of B cell inhibition and simultaneous increase of T cell levels [100]. In the fourth study, on the other hand, the WJ-MSCs were used to treat type 1 diabetes (T1D). The group of 15 newly onset T1D patients were administered with WJ-MSCs intravenously twice in a monthly interval, apart from a standard insulin therapy. As a result, the mean value of glycated hemoglobin significantly decreased compared to the control, whereas the mean C-peptide levels were significantly increased, and therefore it was hypothesized that such a therapy could restore the \u03b2 cell function in a longer period of time [103]. Importantly, no serious side effects or adverse events were reported.",

A total of 23 patients with T2D received WJ-MSCs twice, intravenously for the first time and directly to the pancreas via the splenic artery for the second time. Similar to the results obtained in the case of type 1 diabetes, the C-peptide levels improved, whereas glycated hemoglobin levels decreased after treatment. The authors also reported a reduction in markers of systemic inflammation, whereas no adverse events occurred [104]. Lv et al. (NCT01343511) [105] injected cells isolated from the Wharton\u2019s jelly twice intrathecally to nine patients with autism, alongside cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMNCs). During the 24 week follow up, there was a significant improvement in patients\u2019 symptoms when compared to the control group, as indicated by CARS (The Childhood Autism Rating Scale), CGI (Clinical Global Impression), and ABC (Aberrant Behavior Checklist) scores. Moreover, injections of WJ-MSCs combined with CBMNCs provided a better outcome than the use of CBMNCs alone, and there were no adverse events reported [105]. WJ-MSCs also enhance hematopoiesis after cord blood transplantation, as indicated by Wu et al. [106]. Eight patients with the high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia or the high-risk acute myeloid leukemia were co-transplanted with WJ-MSCs and cord blood, which resulted in shorter time of neutrophil and platelet engraftment when compared to the group of patients receiving the cord blood alone. Importantly, no infusion toxicity or ectopic tissues were observed after the transplantation, and therefore it was hypothesized that WJ-MSC therapy is safe for immunocompromised patients [106].",

In cases where clinical improvement was reported, it was mostly due to immunomodulatory properties of WJ-MSCs. However, such claims must be treated with caution, as some of the aforementioned studies were not blinded or placebo-controlled, or, in the case of neuromyelitis optica [100], the studied group was relatively small. Even though the clinical improvements described in the aforementioned trials seem promising, it is possible that in some cases they occurred due to the placebo effect. Another issue is the fact that tracing of administered cells is problematic, and therefore their fate after the injection remains unclear. Such cells may integrate into host tissue rather than be metabolized and exerted from the body, thus safety issues may not become apparent for decades [107]. Therefore, it is essential to conduct more standardized, blinded, and placebo-controlled trials before introducing WJ-MSC treatment to patients. There is no doubt that all clinical trials should be conducted in accordance to the \u201cGuidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation\u201d, published by ISCT in 2016 [108].",

Apart from meeting the minimal criteria for MSCs, they also express a number of proteins considered as embryonic stem cell markers. The broad differentiation capacity of WJ cells allows them to transform into cells from all three primary germ layers under appropriate stimuli. Apart from this, WJ-MSCs do not express MHC-II and possess unique immunomodulatory properties, which makes them excellent for allogeneic and xenogeneic transplantations. Indeed, a number of preclinical and clinical studies using WJ-MSCs have been performed to examine their potential in the management of various diseases. These stem cells were demonstrated to improve the condition of patients with cardiovascular diseases, immunologic-related disorders, or neurological diseases. The animal studies revealed that therapy with the use of WJ-MSCs may be beneficial in treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, tissue fibrosis, cancer, and spinal cord injury, amongst others, whether it was due to their differentiation into cells of the damaged tissues or paracrine mechanisms. It is important to note that all of these studies were successful in improving clinical outcomes, with no evidence of teratoma formation or immune rejection. Therefore, WJ-MSCs seem to be a great promise of regenerative medicine. However, further studies are needed to consider any possible side effects of WJ therapies.",

Both umbilical vein and umbilical arteries are devoid of tunica adventitia. Between the latter, the residual allantois is located. Wharton\u2019s jelly is a gelatinous connective tissue composed of extracellular matrix abundant in glycosaminoglycans (mostly hyaluronic acid), collagen fibers and myofibroblasts, and occasional mast cells. Stromal cells of Wharton\u2019s jelly are most abundant in the proximity of the umbilical vessels in perivascular Wharton\u2019s jelly, becoming less abundant in intervascular Wharton\u2019s jelly, with the least amount of stromal cells in subamniotic Wharton\u2019s jelly. The degree of stromal cells\u2019 differentiation towards myofibroblasts is the highest near the vessels, gradually decreasing towards the umbilical epithelium.",

The tissue pieces are placed directly on the culture vessel in the explant method, which results in the cell outgrowth on the plastic surface. In the enzymatic method, the tissue pieces are first digested in the enzymatic solution, and after that the cells released from the tissue are centrifuged, suspended in the culture medium, and seeded in the culture vessels.",
