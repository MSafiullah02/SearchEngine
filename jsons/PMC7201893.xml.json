            "text": "Type I hypersensitivity reactions including allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis are a major cause of illness and disability in industrialized countries, and exposure to allergens is a strong risk factor for asthma symptom prevalence and severity (Ring et al., 2001). Fungi are ubiquitous in indoor and outdoor environments, and many fungi are known to cause allergic reactions and exacerbate asthma attacks (Dharmage et al., 2001). Approximately 4.6 million people in the USA have asthma attributable to dampness and mold in homes, with a corresponding annual economic loss estimated at $3.5 billion in 2004 (Mudarri and Fisk, 2007). Another important adverse health outcome caused by fungi is invasive fungal infection including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), which is highly fatal for immunocompromised patients (Lin et al., 2001). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, typically treated with antibiotics and corticosteroids, are likely a main risk group for invasive fungal infections such as IPA (Guinea et al., 2010). However, quantitative aspects of indoor air and surface\u2010associated fungal allergens are largely unknown compared to well\u2010studied dust mite allergens. For instance, while several threshold levels for sensitization and asthma symptoms are suggested for dust mite allergens Der p1 and Fel d1 (Platts\u2010Mills et al., 1992), such values are not available for fungi, in part due to lack of standardized measurement methods.",

            "text": "To date, the current paradigm in measuring a diversity of indoor fungal allergens includes sample by vacuuming and culture\u2010based methods to estimate the fungal allergen contents (Cho et al., 2008; Hicks et al., 2005). Culture\u2010based methods, however, are often biased by the selection of the growth media (Takahashi, 1997) and are incapable of detecting noncultivable microorganisms (Lignell et al., 2008; Meklin et al., 2004) which are potential allergens and pathogens (Hirvonen et al., 1997). Additionally, growth\u2010based methods cannot detect nonviable fungi, which still have clinical importance because they retain bioactive materials such as ergosterol and allergenic proteins (Kauffman and Van Der Heide, 2003). Furthermore, identification of fungal species by growth\u2010based methods is based on the observation of their microscopic and macroscopic morphologies, and accuracy of the identification can thus be biased by an operator\u2019s experience and level of expertise. Some research, for example, has indicated growth\u2010based methods underestimate concentrations of fungi in dust by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude compared to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\u2010based measurements (Meklin et al., 2004). Consequently, traditional growth\u2010based methods likely lead to less toxicologically relevant exposure assessments for epidemiologic analyses. In contrast, emerging molecular\u2010based methods including qPCR are not dependent on fungal cultivability or viability and therefore appear to be toxicologically more relevant than growth\u2010based methods.",

Using the DNA sequences for qPCR probes and primers provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Haugland and Vesper, 2002), some studies also quantified fungi in house dust (Cai et al., 2009; Lignell et al., 2008; Meklin et al., 2004; Vesper et al., 2004, 2007). The majority of these studies (Lignell et al., 2008; Meklin et al., 2004; Vesper et al., 2004, 2007) used vacuum cleaner methods to collect house dust. In these methods, house dust is collected from a specified area of carpeted or hard floors, and sampled dust is sieved and weighed for subsequent qPCR\u2010based detection methodologies. Although the methods are suitable to collect large quantities of house dust and allow for dust collection from carpeted areas, they are relatively intrusive upon participants during field monitoring, and for hard surfaces like wood floors as well as for carpets of varying pile, do not as efficiently remove surface\u2010bound organisms compared to the moist wipe method standardized for lead sampling (Reynolds et al., 1997). Moreover, highly accurate and precise measurement methods to identify and quantify target fungal species are still needed.",

Samples were taken from homes of older adults with asthma and COPD. For further details about the targeted community, CBPR process, recruitment of participants, and results from using three questionnaires and one technician walk\u2010through survey, see the study by Shendell et al. (2011a). In the present study, we summarize these key details. A modification to an existing wipe sampling method developed by ASTM (Method E 1728\u201003) (ASTM, 2003) was used to collect floor dust. Pre\u2010wetted wipes with 6% isopropyl alcohol (23 \u00d7 23 cm, polyester, TX1086 Vectra QuanSat, ITW Texwipe) were used to collect dust on a 30 \u00d7 30 cm floor area. The selected surface area was wiped side to side several times while applying pressure with the fingertips. Nine homes were sampled in the cooling season, of which six homes were selected for repeated measurements in the heating season. Samples were taken in the kitchen on hard flooring that was relatively smooth and nonporous (e.g., tile and sheet vinyl floors). Within individual homes, we also identified and sampled other locations with flooring similar to that in the kitchen (e.g., another room if continuous with the kitchen, like a home office or computer workspace, or the den/living room and/or family room). In five of the homes considered during the cooling and heating seasons, two sampling locations (i.e., kitchen and other location) were selected. Overall, 30 samples across study homes and both seasons, including two field blanks and six duplicates, were collected. For duplicates, sampling locations were adjacent to one another, i.e., primary and duplicate samples were side\u2010by\u2010side. A field blank was a wipe handled in the same manner as both the field and duplicate samples except no sample was conducted, i.e., no surface was wiped. Sampled wipes were stored in screw\u2010top glass containers (USEPA class 1/2, purchased from Cole\u2010Parmer) in a \u221220\u00b0C freezer until subsequent analysis. We also note that a technician walk\u2010through survey, composed of previously validated questions in specific sections from a federal agency tool, was conducted in each study home each season. Topics included potential exposure agents, including known environmental asthma triggers, ventilation\u2014both natural and mechanical\u2014and the observed conditions of bathrooms, ceilings, floors and walls, doors, the water heater, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, kitchen, laundry area, lighting, patio/porch/deck/balcony, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, stairs and windows.

To prepare standards for qPCR, spores of A. fumigatus, C. cladosporioides, and P. chrysogenum were generated by growth on malt extract agar. The spores were harvested by cotton swabs and suspended in 10 ml of 70% ethanol. The suspensions were divided into 1.5\u2010ml microtubes to obtain several subsamples. These subsamples were centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 3 min to pellet the spores, and the ethanol supernatant was removed from the tubes prior to DNA extraction. To generate the standard curves based on cell counts, the numbers of spores in the pellets were enumerated by direct microscopy (Hospodsky et al., 2010). Unlike fungal species forming unicellular amerospores, such as A. fumigatus, C. cladosporioides, and P. chrysogenum, accurate cell enumeration is difficult for A. alternata and E. nigrum, which produce multicellular dictyospores. Therefore, tissues of approximately 4 cm2 areas of the colonies were collectively isolated and used to prepare the DNA standards for these two species, and the original numbers of fungal cells were back\u2010calculated based on the recovered DNA quantities and genome sizes of these two fungal species. Then the theoretical mass concentration of DNA per cell for each A. alternate and E. nigrum organism was estimated by Equation 1 (Dolezel et al., 2003): (1)\n",

We assumed a 10% DNA extraction efficiency for these two species based on levels typically observed for fungal spore DNA extraction in our laboratory (Hospodsky et al., 2010). For all five fungal species considered and in general for fungi, the quantities of rRNA gene copies are known to be highly variable by fungal strain (Herrera et al., 2009). As a result, in this study, qPCR standards were based on the total numbers of spores harvested from the five above\u2010mentioned fungal strains rather than from the gene copies. For universal fungal qPCR, standard curves were generated using the A. fumigatus DNA standard.",

The qPCR MDLs for Aaltr and PenGrp3 were higher and reflect the lower PCR amplification efficiencies (75\u201385%) for these two primer sets compared to efficiencies for the remaining primers, which averaged >95%. The qPCR MDLs are typically smaller than one cell because 18S rRNA genes usually occurred as a multiple tandem repeat. For instance, A. fumigatus has an average 54 copies of 18S rRNA gene per cell (Herrera et al., 2009). One field blank was employed per sampling season to identify degrees of field contamination. Few fungi were identified with the exception for FF2/FR1 showing a higher field blank value (0.49 cell) than the qPCR MDL (0.05 cell). Consequently, the qPCR MDL for FF2/FR1 was defined to be 0.49 cell. Incorporating factors associated with accuracy in sample analysis including DNA extraction efficiencies from cells (10%) and whole\u2010cell recovery from sampling wipes (20% for Aaltr and Enigr, and the values listed in Table 2 for the remaining species), fractions of DNA extract (1 \u03bcl out of total 50 \u03bcl extract) and membrane filter analyzed (one\u2010quarter), and the fact that 900 cm2 was the sampled area in study homes, the overall MDLs per unit surface area of sampled floor for FF2/FR1, Aaltr, Afumi, Cclad2, Enigr, PenGrp3, and PenAsp1mgb were calculated to be 5.7, 3.1, 0.6, 1.6, 0.8, 25, and 0.6 cell/cm2, respectively.",

Reporting fungal concentrations in cell/cm2 is more relevant in human exposure assessments because it provides an absolute metric for microorganisms for a unit area of a home.

Positive correlations were found among fungal species with the exception being Afumi and PenGrp3 (r = \u22120.040), for which majorities of the samples were below MDLs. The greatest correlation was found between Cclad2 and Enigr (r = 0.977). Vesper et al. (2004) classified 32 species of fungi based on association with water damage of house, i.e., group 1 species associated with water damage and group 2 species not associated with water damage. Concentrations of group 1 species including A. fumigatus and P. chrysogenum were below MDLs in most of the present study\u2019s samples (Figure 2), which suggested water damage was not so severe, i.e., observed less frequently in the present sample population. This was confirmed through use of a technician walk\u2010through survey conducted by community partners and researchers, which included questions to identify leaks, water\u2010damaged flooring, wall and other interior finish materials, and any visible signs of mold (Shendell et al., 2011a). We also found positive correlations between the universal fungal detections (FF2/FR1 and PenAsp1mgb) and the remaining species\u2010specific detections (Aaltr, Afumi, Cclad2, Enigr, and PenGrp3). This result suggested that a single universal fungal qPCR may be a strong indicator for multiple species\u2010specific qPCR to characterize degrees of fungal contaminations in homes, although species\u2010specific fungal detection may be desirable to better understand links with pathologies associated with each specific fungal species.",

The tendency was particularly true for Cclad2 and Enigr (P < 0.05; Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test). Some research has suggested concentrations of fungal species or assay groups in house dust varied significantly between different seasons (Kaarakainen et al., 2009). Although underlying causes of this tendency remains unclear, sampling in multiple seasons appears recommended to characterize representative whole\u2010year concentrations in a home. We note in the study community, in general, the summer cooling season demands air conditioning systems\u2014homes vary in terms of added humidity to supply air\u2014with windows and doors remaining closed most of the time, whereas in the winter heating season, space heating is typically needed late night through the morning until ambient temperature rises and morning fog dissipates. Future research should examine the potential role of air exchange rates and of particle filtration affecting measured concentrations of fungi of outdoor origin in home surface dust.",

The spatial variations in terms of cumulative COVs were calculated according to Equation 2 and presented in Table 5. Cumulative COVs excluding nondetected pairs ranged 45\u201394%, which were comparable to cumulative COVs for the measurement precision (Table 3). Given the similar variation level estimated here, the observed spatial variation was likely due to measurement reproducibility, which is large when compared to variation associated with the spatial inhomogeneity of fungi in a single sampling site (study home). The observed tendency was consistent with findings on spatial variation of airborne fungi reported by previous literature (Ren et al., 2001; Reboux et al., 2009). However, in a moisture\u2010damaged residence, some studies have also indicated the airborne fungal concentrations were different between rooms (Hyvarinen et al., 2001). Therefore, in future, larger field studies could help confirm this finding, especially for homes with historical and/or present moisture damages as well as larger and/or multistory homes. In the present field study, the study homes were one floor ranch style or apartments/condominiums with windows and/or sliding doors to the outdoors.",

Spatial variations in fungal concentrations for a single sampling site (home) in the same seasons were relatively small. This wipe sampling method was less intrusive in homes of susceptible, vulnerable populations like immunocompromised older adults, i.e., less disruptive for participants and not noisy compared to vacuums used in previous studies of environmental asthma triggers and heavy metals. Therefore, this method, in conjunction with growth\u2010independent qPCR methodologies, shows potential to improve human exposure studies for fungal pathogens and allergens in house dust as well as epidemiologic studies of older adults with chronic respiratory diseases and other potential comorbidity.",
