            "text": "Prior to the development of the transmission electron microscope, cells and bacteria could be observed by light microscopy, but the only viruses that could be visualised were the poxviruses. Although poxviruses were the largest of the viruses known at that time (approximately 250 nm), no morphological detail could be seen under an optimally adjusted light microscope. The resolution limit of light microscopy of approximately 200 nm formed a barrier to visualising all other viruses and bacterial ultrastructure. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) or \u2018supermicroscope\u2019 (Gabor, 1945) was first described by Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska in 1932 (Knoll and Ruska, 1932). The successful development of the TEM, with its resolution limit of about one thousand times greater than the light microscope and the subsequent, albeit limited, availability of commercial electron microscopes post 1945, revolutionised many aspects of virology and microbiology. Ernst Ruska's brother Helmut, was one of the first workers to visualise viruses (Kruger et al., 2000). Key events in the development of electron microscopy have recently been reviewed by Haguenau and colleagues (Haguenau et al., 2003). To fully exploit the potential of the TEM, new methods for specimen preparation and new procedures for fixation, embedding, sectioning and staining were developed (Nermut et al., 1987, Harris, 1997). Since viruses and bacteria are very small, it was also necessary to develop thin films to coat EM specimen grids to support these organisms. Early imaging of viruses and bacteria was accomplished by depositing metal atoms onto the organisms to provide the necessary contrast for their visualisation: this was known as the \u2018shadow casting\u2019 technique. The introduction of negative contrast staining, using solutions of heavy metal salts, greatly simplified specimen preparation and revealed far greater detail in the ultrastructure of viruses and bacteria (Brenner and Horne, 1959). Increased commercial production of TEMs made the instruments available to many institutions, including universities and hospital laboratories and, together with the new specimen preparation methods, allowed investigation of a whole range of infectious diseases.",

By the mid 1990s many laboratories and organisations were forced to rationalise their EM facilities as a result of the introduction of these new methods and financial constraints, which would not allow the automatic replacement of costly electron microscopes on a one to one basis. This rationalisation allowed some facilities to survive while others were forced to close down.",

Plastic support films must be of suitable thickness in order to be durable yet not degrade the resolution of the image produced by the microscope. Polyvinyl formal (Formvar) is commonly used (1\u20134% in a solvent), but other compounds such as nitrocellulose (Collodion) are also suitable. A carbon coating applied to the plastic film can enhance its stability and prevent deformation and rupture due to thermal stress caused by the electron beam. Plastic films are easier to prepare and are more durable than carbon support films, but where ultimate-resolution imaging is required, carbon films alone are preferred.",

Metals (gold, platinum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten) or metal alloys (gold/palladium, platinum/palladium) are vacuum deposited at an angle of between 30 and 45 \u00b0 onto the specimens adhering to the support film. This procedure, carried out within a vacuum coating unit, requires careful monitoring of the thickness of the metal to avoid masking surface detail on bacteria and viruses (Fig. 1\n). The method is technically demanding and proved non-ideal for routine examination of clinical specimens. The introduction of the far simpler negative staining technique relegated metal shadowing to specialised applications only, for example the visualisation of nucleic acids (Fig. 2\n).",

This technique uses the electron scattering power of heavy metal salts to provide contrast to viruses or bacteria so that surface detail may be seen. The convenience and simplicity of the method allows routine examination of many samples compared to the significantly more cumbersome metal shadowing technique. Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is probably the most commonly used negative stain within diagnostic microbiology, but there are others that are used routinely (e.g. ammonium molybdate, uranyl acetate, sodium silicotungstate, methylamine tungstate). A solution of the stain is either mixed with a suspension of the virus or bacterial sample suspension before application to the grid or it may be applied to the grid after the sample has been adsorbed to the support film. The pH of the negative stain may have a significant effect on the detail seen and contrast produced in a specimen (Madeley, 1972). For instance, group B rotaviruses can be difficult to detect if the wrong stain is used (Nakata et al., 1987, Suzuki et al., 1987). Also, poxviruses show better ultrastructure with uranyl acetate staining, but this stain is not necessarily good for other viruses.",

Fixed specimens are dehydrated in ethanol and usually embedded in an epoxy resin, such as Araldite\u2122 or Epon\u2122, prior to thin sectioning.

However, for detection of small particles like viruses, it is generally considered that there must be a minimum of 106\u2013108 virus particles/ml present in a sample to allow detection and it is therefore often necessary to concentrate the particles by such methods as differential centrifugation or ammonium sulphate precipitation (Caul et al., 1978).

SPIEM was originally developed for the detection of plant viruses (Derrick, 1973) and was subsequently adopted by electron microscopists working with a variety of human viruses. In SPIEM, a specimen grid with support film is coated with specific antibody. This antibody-coated grid is then floated on a drop of the virus sample under investigation. Virus particles are attracted onto the grid surface and these are spread individually over the grid rather than being aggregated into clumps. A major use of SPIEM has been for the detection of viruses associated with gastroenteritis, particularly noroviruses, which are often present in small numbers making detection by EM difficult (Lewis et al., 1988) and for enteric adenoviruses (Wood and Bailey, 1987).",

Post-embedding immuno-labelling may be performed on thin sections prepared from organisms, infected cells or tissues which have been embedded in a hydrophilic resin (e.g. LR White or Lowicryl), which is compatible with antigen/antibody binding. Pre-embedding immuno-labelling of cells, permeabilised to allow access of the labelled antibody to the antigen, may also be may carried out. Should chemical fixation destroy the antigen of interest, cryofixation techniques are available (Harris, 1997). These procedures involve rapid freezing of the sample, followed by cryo-sectioning at a temperature of about minus 120 \u00b0C, using a cryo-ultramicrotome. Cryosections are collected on support films on specimen grids, thawed, incubated with labelled antibody and stained before TEM examination.

Flagella are the structures responsible for this type of translational motility, but these appendages cannot normally be resolved under the light microscope. Under the TEM, bacterial flagella show a completely different structure from the flagella and cilia seen in higher organisms. The external part of the bacterial flagellum, which is normally visible, appears to be a structurally simple helical filament. However, at the base of the filament, a hook structure with complex basal architecture is embedded in the bacterial cell wall (Murray, 1978).

These have a diameter of about 80 nm but show great variability in length, occasionally exceeding 20 \u03bcm. Smaller viruses are known, but these mainly infect bacteria (bacteriophages). The morphology of viruses is usually consistent within one group. For example all adenoviruses have icosahedral symmetry and are the same shape and size. Some viruses, such as the paramyxoviruses, which cause measles, mumps and other respiratory infections are pleomorphic (Fig. 10\n), but possess characteristic internal components (nucleocapsids with helical symmetry) of a specific diameter and structure. Paramyxoviruses contain a long, thin helical nucleocapsid 18\u201322 nm in diameter, with a \u2018herringbone\u2019 appearance, which is a diagnostic feature.

Variola, the virus causing of smallpox, was endemic in some parts of the world, but outbreaks in large centres of population are known to have occurred during many periods of recorded human history up until the mid 20th century. Smallpox infection is fatal in up to 30% of infected individuals. Although classically seen as a skin infection, it is the release of virus from lesions in the respiratory tract and subsequent airborne transmission via the respiratory route that initiated outbreaks. Poxviruses are large viruses, the two major groups of which are orthopoxviruses (Fig. 4) and parapoxviruses (Fig. 11\n). Smallpox (Variola) is caused by an orthopoxvirus. Clinically, the skin lesions produced in chicken pox may easily be confused with those of smallpox. Vesicle fluid is very rich in virus particles and direct EM examination of vesicle fluid or scrapings of skin lesion leads to rapid identification of the virus group involved. Identification of a herpes virus (Fig. 5) rather than an orthopox virus negated the need to activate the public health measures (mass vaccination, quarantine, contact tracing) that would be required in the case of smallpox.",

Subsequently this antigen was found in about 20% of patients with viral hepatitis and is now known as hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HbsAg). For laboratory diagnosis of hepatitis B, the patient serum under investigation was mixed with a high titre immune serum and examined by EM (see Section 2.7). Under the electron microscope three types of particle may be identified (Fig. 12\n): small approximately 20 nm spheres, tubules 20 nm in diameter and up to 100 nm long and complex particles about 42 nm in diameter known as Dane particles. The Dane particle is the intact hepatitis B virus, whereas the spheres and tubules are excess viral protein (Dane et al., 1970). In the 1960s and 1970s, liver biopsies were sometimes performed on jaundiced patients and liver cells examined for the presence of Dane particles or core particles (internal components of Dane particles) migrating from the liver nuclei into the cytoplasm (Almeida et al., 1971). The immune electron microscopy method of detecting Australia antigen remained in use until about the mid 1980s when alternative methods of detection, such as radioimmuno assay, and later EIA became available.",

B19 is the cause of a common childhood rash disease, erythema infectiosum, colloquially known as \u2018slapped cheek syndrome\u2019 because of the bright red cheeks induced by the rash. We now know that this virus not only infects infants, but infection during pregnancy can seriously damage the developing foetus leading to hydrops fetalis and in some cases to spontaneous abortion. B19 infection is also a problem in individuals with chronic haemolytic disease (e.g. sickle cell anaemia), as infection can result in a significant and dangerous depression of haemoglobin levels (aplastic crisis). Development of other diagnostic techniques, particularly PCR, has resulted in EM now being rarely used for routine diagnosis of this virus, although it is occasionally used in reference laboratories where there are conflicting or equivocal results by other methods. Accurate diagnosis is important in pregnant women and those with haemolytic disorders as it can influence the clinical management of the patient.",

Some viruses could be grown from some stool samples, but it was subsequently shown that these were not the causative agents of viral gastroenteritis. Convincing evidence of an association between cultivable viruses and diarrhoea was rare. However, in the early 1970s, EM was used to examine diarrhoeal samples from patients with no bacterial cause for their symptoms and a number of new, non-cultivable viruses were discovered. Viruses were found to be common causes of infantile non-bacterial gastroenteritis and were responsible for many outbreaks of gastroenteritis in all age groups. The first of these viruses was Norwalk virus, which was derived from a community outbreak in Norwalk, OH, USA (Kapikian and Wyatt, 1972, Kapikian, 2000). Using IEM, Kapikian and colleagues were able to demonstrate the presence of virus in volunteers who developed enteric symptoms after ingesting stool filtrates from samples from this outbreak. Under the electron microscope, the virus was characterised by its round shape, small size of 30\u201335 nm and its \u2018fuzzy\u2019 or ragged edge (Fig. 13\n). Similar viruses with the same morphology were discovered elsewhere and were given interim names such as \u2018Norwalk-like viruses\u2019 or \u2018small round structured viruses\u2019 (SRSVs) to reflect their appearance in the electron microscope (Caul and Appleton, 1982). The interim names for this group of viruses have recently been reviewed and they are now officially known as \u2018noroviruses\u2019 (Mayo, 2002). Noroviruses are regarded as the commonest cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in developed countries. They are highly infectious, readily transmissible from person to person and are also the most frequent and important cause of foodborne viral infections (Appleton, 2000). Until fairly recently, EM was the main method of norovirus detection, but has been largely superseded by EIA and PCR methods.",

The two new adenoviruses, designated adenoviruses types 40 and 41 were specifically associated with gastroenteritis and formed a new group, the F adenoviruses (Gary et al., 1979). Unlike many other adenoviruses, these two new adenoviruses could not readily be cultured in the laboratory and hence became known as \u2018fastidious adenoviruses\u2019.

This virus had the appearance of a calicivirus, being about 32\u201335 nm in diameter with surface hollows (Madeley and Cosgrove, 1976). These hollows (or cups) become filled with the negative stain, giving rise to a \u2018star of David\u2019 appearance in some orientations (Fig. 17\n). Enterically transmitted caliciviruses are now named sapoviruses (Kogasaka et al., 1981) and are most often associated with gastroenteritis in young children (whereas noroviruses infect all age groups). The two viruses have morphological similarities and both are classified in the Calicivirus family, although in separate genera.",

However, by the late 1990s, EM within the PHLS was in decline due to the introduction of new methods of virus detection that were more sensitive than EM and could readily be used for dealing with large numbers of specimens, although initially these tests were only available in specialised laboratories. The reduction in EM facilities necessitated a rationalised virological EM specimen testing policy for the investigation of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis (Curry et al., 1999). Large numbers of outbreaks with many specimens being generated from each outbreak, could not be handled by the remaining PHLS EM facilities and in order to give a good diagnostic service with limited facilities it was necessary for the number of samples examined from each outbreak to be restricted. It had been recognised that most community outbreaks of gastroenteritis were caused by noroviruses and hence if two or more samples were found to be norovirus positive, then the outbreak was declared to be a positive norovirus outbreak and no further samples were examined. This testing algorithm allowed EM units to continue to diagnose norovirus infections until widespread use of specific PCR tests for noroviruses were adopted in routine virus laboratories or specific norovirus EIAs became commercially available. Norovirus EIAs were introduced to the UK during the latter half of 2002. Norovirus EIA and PCR tests are in the process of or have now superseded EM as the front-line tests for the investigation of non-bacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks in routine virology laboratories.",

The terrible events of September 11th 2001 and the unrelated deliberate release of anthrax spores in the USA at around the same time has alerted most countries to the serious consequences of deliberate release of other infectious agents such as smallpox. Diagnostic facilities must be in place to rapidly identify the causative agent present in atypical or suspicious skin lesions, be it smallpox or other viruses, so that unnecessary public panic can be avoided and appropriate control measures established. Electron microscopy has an important role in a rapid emergency diagnostic service and must be maintained as part of a balanced diagnostic response system, so that only orthopox samples are referred to specialist centres for definitive identification by molecular typing. Such a system requires a small network of well supported regionally based EM units with the necessary staff expertise in place to monitor viruses associated with skin lesions and to act as an early warning to the deliberate release of smallpox or other microbial agents. The risk of smallpox reappearing is small, but if a terrorist group were to obtain the virus, the possibility exists that it could be genetically modified to accentuate its pathogenic traits. A consequence of this would be that primers used in specific smallpox PCR tests might not amplify the nucleic acid, thereby rendering PCR as a means of diagnosis temporarily invalid. Such a modified virus would still be recognisable morphologically as a poxvirus under the electron microscope. This presents strong justification for the need to keep a network of microscopes and microscopists skilled in viral diagnosis, since EM is not dependant on detection of viral nucleic acid or expressed antigen.",

Prior to this, it was thought that monkeypox only occurred in the tropical forest regions of Africa, where it was fatal in up to 10% of human cases. Some clinicians who had treated infected individuals in the USA outbreak had initially mistaken the monkeypox lesions for smallpox or chickenpox (Reed et al., 2004). Most infections appeared in owners of exotic pet rodents or workers in veterinary centres or pet shops. Other unrelated cases of unusual orthopoxvirus infections have recently been reported. A case of severe generalized cowpox infection has recently been seen in Finland and was diagnosed using EM, cell culture (virus isolation) and molecular techniques (Pelkonen et al., 2003). In the USA, a woman who was revaccinated against smallpox showed a variety of symptoms including lesions on the face, legs, trunk and upper extremities (Miller et al., 2003). The presence of orthopoxviruses in lesion fluid was demonstrated by electron microscopy. This was the first report of generalized vaccinia among civilians receiving vaccination against smallpox in the current heightened alert state and highlights the concerns associated with the re-introduction of widespread use of smallpox vaccine.",

Viruses from a number of different families with different morphologies may cause haemorrhagic fever in humans. For example, the virus causing Lassa fever is an arenavirus while Crimean\u2013Congo haemorrhagic fever is caused by a bunyavirus. Marburg and Ebola, the most dangerous of these viruses, are members of the filovirus family (Fig. 20\n). Some bunyaviruses, such as Rift Valley Fever virus and Hantavirus, cause severe and sometimes fatal encephalitis in humans. Other viruses causing severe encephalitis, such as West Nile Fever and Dengue, are flaviviruses. Humans are not the natural hosts for any of these zoonotic viruses and normally only become infected by exposure to the animal vector. Rodents are the natural hosts for arenaviruses, and bunyaviruses and flaviviruses are transmitted by arthropods, mainly blood-sucking ticks and mosquitoes. Despite much investigative work, the natural host of the filoviruses has yet to be identified. Most haemorrhagic fever viruses are associated with tropical regions, but recently interest has focused on West Nile Fever, which emerged in birds in New York in 1999. Human infections subsequently occurred throughout North America and there are now ongoing studies of bird flocks in several countries. The distinctive filamentous morphology of Filoviruses allows their detection by EM in acute phase patient serum. However, this technique is not routinely employed for the diagnosis of other haemorrhagic fever viruses, but is used in supporting research on the structure and pathogenesis of these agents and in the development of other diagnostic methods and therapeutic regimes. Most of these viruses have high mortality rates and must be inactivated before processing for EM. The fixatives used for this (such as buffered formaldehyde) must be carefully chosen so as not to mask or degrade the morphological features of interest.",

Certainly laboratory managers faced with limited budgets are, almost inevitably, going to opt for the new molecular technologies, which offer the promise of greater sensitivity and specificity, rather than invest in expensive new electron microscopes. Also, specimens for EM require individual examination by an experienced electron microscopist, a process that cannot be automated and results in a relatively limited throughput of specimens. Economic arguments can be misleading, however. Over the long-term, despite the high initial capital costs, EM comes out as a very cost effective technique. Unlike other modern diagnostic equipment, electron microscopes have a useful life expectancy of around 20 years. In addition, consumable costs are almost negligible compared to expensive molecular diagnostic reagents. Electron microscopy still has much to offer and if such narrow attitudes persist, there may be a need for a national strategy to be put in place in order to safeguard EM capability within virology in the UK.

However, most gastroenteritis viruses contain an RNA genome, susceptible to spontaneous mutation, which may alter the RNA or expressed proteins, making them undetectable by existing EIAs or PCR assays.
