The probable transmission from individuals before the onset of symptoms or very early minimal symptoms makes COVID-19 much more difficult to control.

Many of the EMR countries addressed the need for increasing capacity in the areas of surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing and follow-up of potential contacts, strict health facility infection prevention and control, and other active public health control interventions. Moreover, countries addressed the need for communication strategies that provide general populations and vulnerable populations with actionable information for self-protection, including identification of symptoms, and clear guidance for seeking treatment.",

As service-based training programs implement competency-based training under the supervision of qualified mentors/supervisors, these programs focus on the practice of epidemiology in real time and real place. These programs are focused on building workforce capacity to contribute to strengthening their country\u2019s health system to detect, notify, report, and respond to events that threaten the national and international health. They focus on public health surveillance, outbreak investigations, epidemiological methods, laboratory and biosafety, risk communications, health-related surveys, and evaluation of the impact of prevention and control programs. The FETPs\u2019 curricula aim to improve public health systems and develop professional skills to ensure the country meets the surveillance and response requirements. The programs are established within the Ministries of Health and access technical assistance from the CDC.",
