            "text": "The question \u201cwhy do parasites harm their hosts?\u201d is recurrent in evolutionary biology and ecology, and has several implications for the medical sciences, particularly public health and epidemiology.1 The question is perplexing because of its paradoxical aspect. Indeed, one wonders why natural selection favours high virulence if this inevitably results in both the host and the pathogen\u2019s deaths. Shouldn\u2019t host and pathogens30 peacefully coevolve, and thus maximize both their chances of survival, instead of engaging in a near-infinite arms race? Very much along these lines, The Lives of a Cell (1974) by American physician Lewis Thomas reflected the conviction that \u201cthere is nothing to be gained, in an evolutionary sense, by the capacity to cause illness or death\u201d (Thomas 1974, 77). Thomas\u2019 views on the nature of disease were once widely accepted among medical scientists during the past century.2 The possibility of eradicating diseases like smallpox, combined with the belief that evolution was going to naturally wipe out infections, worked together in supporting the idea of the end of infectious diseases (Levins 1994). Physician and epidemiologist Aidan Cockburn, for instance, stated confidently: \u201cit seems reasonable to anticipate that within some measurable time, such as 100 years, all the major infections will have disappeared\u201d (Cockburn 1963, 150). Following the improved control over infections provided by vaccines, antibiotics, and chemotherapy, biomedical authorities in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in the U.S., ceased to regard infectious diseases as one of the major causes of death and morbidity, and argued, furthermore, that fundamental research on microorganisms could be halted altogether (Burnet 1953 in Fantini 1993). This perspective was also reflected at the political and economic levels. After the \u201cwar\u201d on cancer and cardio-vascular diseases was declared in the early 1970s, for instance, the budget of the National Institute of Health (NIH) doubled in 5 years, while the funding for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) grew by only 20 % (Krause 1998, 3). The belief in the power of medical technology to conquer infectious diseases with newly developed drugs resulted in the idea that given sufficient time most of these diseases would naturally decline as a result of the evolutionary dynamics that govern host and pathogens\u2019 relation and lead to lower levels of virulence over time (M\u00e9thot 2012a; Snowden 2008).",

            "text": "The return of infectious diseases from the early 1980s onwards turned this perspective on its head, however, as the responses of modern medicine seemed no longer adequate in the face of the steep rise of nosocomial infections and the evolution of drug resistance worldwide. Particularly, the acute sense of control over infectious disease felt by many was thrown into disarray with the onset of the HIV pandemic and other emerging infections such as Ebola fever, SARS, and more recently with the return of H1N1 influenza. Partly because \u201cmany people find it difficult to accommodate the reality that Nature is far from benign\u201d (Lederberg 1993, 3), the rationale of the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d (as named by May and Anderson 1983) \u2013 namely that hosts and pathogens should coevolve towards a state of harmlessness \u2013 was promoted far into the second half of the twentieth century (see Ewald 1994 for a review). An additional reason for the success of this avirulence hypothesis, besides its intuitive soundness, was the fact that no serious alternatives to it were introduced before the late 1970s (Alizon et al. 2009), even though some like zoologist Gordon Ball (1943) did raise important objections to the conventional wisdom. The thesis of a natural decline in the virulence of infectious disease postulated by earlier evolution-led models has been challenged on both theoretical and experimental grounds in the last 30 years. Empirical evidence and advances in modelling in evolutionary ecology (e.g. the trade-off model) have shown, for instance, that the evolution of hosts and parasites into a commensal state is not the vanishing, obligate point it was once held to be, but is rather only one of the possible evolutionary outcomes (Anderson and May 1982; Levin and Pimentel 1981; Ewald 1983; reviewed in Alizon et al. 2009). As biologist Carl Bergstrom recently stressed: \u201cwe cannot count on evolution to do our work for us\u201d (Bergstrom 2008, 261). Selective pressures, on the contrary, can drive the emergence of new diseases (Antia et al. 2003). And as some have argued, humans may well be the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest evolutionary force\u201d (Palumbi 2001) behind the increased virulence of pathogens.",

This of course adds up to the continuing emergence of human pathogens through zoonotic reservoirs (Wolfe et al. 2007). Infectious diseases continue to be a serious threat to human health, and some diseases once believed to be eradicated might return. Between 1940 and 2004, 335 diseases have emerged in human populations, the majority of them appearing during the 1980s after rapid increase in drug resistance was detected (Jones et al. 2008). Despite the recent steep rise in chronic and degenerative illnesses, emerging infections are still a global challenge for twenty-first century biomedicine and they continue to claim 15 million lives annually (Morens et al. 2004; Fauci 2000). Following the resurgence of infectious diseases as a leading cause of death and morbidity, and the detection of previously unknown disease-causing entities, the idea that newly emerged pathogens have thrown the natural world \u201cout of balance\u201d (Garrett 1994) has garnered a significant amount of scientific attention and has led to the adoption of new international health regulations in order to monitor, limit, and control the spread of communicable diseases (Castillo-Salgado 2010). Here, we explore how, and in what contexts (molecular, ecological, and evolutionary), knowledge claims about disease emergence and changes in virulence are made and justified in the case one specific example: the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic.",

            "text": "Emerging diseases are usually defined as diseases whose incidence has significantly increased within a population over a definite period of time (Morse 1995).3 As Weir and Mykhalovski (2010) recently observed, two of the most influential books on emerging diseases in the early 1990s (Lederberg et al. 1992; Morse 1993) have stressed the need to investigate factors driving disease emergence from both an ecological and a molecular-genetic point of view. Both books argued that the biology of the host and the pathogen, in addition to their complex interactions in changing ecological and evolutionary contexts, must be carefully considered in order to devise appropriate public health measures. In practice, though, it remains a challenging task to integrate those perspectives. Indeed, our starting point is the current gap \u2013 and lack of integration \u2013 in the literature between studies of virulence as applied to emerging disease in the biomedical sciences broadly understood and in molecular pathology and evolutionary ecology in particular. Integration is a multi-faceted concept that is often promoted as a promising goal of scientific practice. As discussed by philosophers of science, integration in science is a complex process that encompasses several activities such as methodological integration, data integration, and explanatory integration (O\u2019Malley and Soyer 2012; see also Mitchell 2008), among others.4 More rarely is the possibility that integration will fail discussed, however (see O\u2019Malley (2013) for an example of such). As this chapter exemplifies, ecological and molecular methodologies have yet to come together to provide a broader picture of changes in virulence in emerging diseases. Here, we focus particularly on experimental and modelling practices in molecular biomedicine and evolutionary ecology and on their respective explanatory limitations. Very often, explanations of the virulence of a pandemics are constructed as an alternative between knowing the biological nature of the pathogen or that of the environmental conditions that facilitate its transmission. While both consider the nature of the host as part of the disease process, most of the time one branch of the alternative alone is considered as the right (or at least sufficient) explanation while attention to other explanatory schemes is scant. Using the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic as a case study of a particularly virulent emerging disease, we illustrate the enduring persistence of two distinct scientific styles of practice in the recent history of virulence studies.",

We argue that an evolutionary approach is necessary to understand the dynamics of disease transmission and evolution but that a broader understanding of virulence will ultimately benefit from articulating the ecological dynamics with cellular mechanisms of virulence. In sum, both ecological and functional perspectives on host-pathogens\u2019 interactions are required to answer the opening question of this essay but also to devise appropriate health-care measures in order to prevent (and predict?) future influenza pandemics and other emerging threats.

More recently, evolutionary ecologists have argued in the direction of a better integration of those perspectives (Frank and Schmid-Hempel 2008). While Mayr\u2019s point that proximate and ultimate explanations are not alternatives is sound, developmental biology advocates, among others, have persuasively argued that evolutionary questions are relevant to understanding developmental processes, and vice-versa (see Laland et al. 2011 for a review). Today, another, and perhaps equally significant divide, seems to be that between ecological and functional (or proximate) approaches to biological systems and their evolution. As we show, what we call exogenous and endogenous approaches to virulence both make knowledge claims based (sometimes loosely) on evolutionary theory, although each of them invokes one particular aspect of the theory.5 Whereas the ecological (or exogenous) style focuses on processes (e.g. selective pressures, population density, within and between host competition, and so on) acting on the hosts and the pathogen, the molecular (or endogenous) style traces the evolutionary pathway, or patterns, of the influenza virus from animal(s) to man, and, by constructing molecular phylogenies, identifies particular genes for pathogenesis and mutation sites within lineages.6 In other words, the former analyses one of the main mechanisms of evolution (i.e. natural selection) and the latter describe the path of evolution (i.e. they construct phylogenies) (Ruse 1992). The construction of molecular phylogenetic trees by molecular pathologists reflects the recent \u201cdata-driven\u201d trend itself supported by genomics, molecular biology, and the development of high throughput technologies. The use of \u201cevolution\u201d by molecular pathologists is, however, secondary to finding molecular mechanisms for pathogenesis and thus explaining changes in virulence mechanistically.",

            "text": "Each perspective also provides a different way of thinking about disease emergence. Briefly, the endogenous view describes how bacteria and viruses can be transformed into pathogenic, emerging diseases by gaining intracellular and genetic material such as, for instance, a polysaccharide capsule, a large plasmid, a set of virulence genes, or pathogenicity islands (Friesen et al. 2006). These and similar findings have led some to claim that pathogens can evolve in \u201cquantum leap\u201d (Groisman and Ochman 1996). Point mutations allowing the virus to bind to a host receptor also belong to this category. While the capacity to cause disease due to new sets of genes is a crucial aspect of how organisms become pathogenic, this capacity can also occasionally result from genomic deletion and gene loss (Maurelli 2006). In sum, acquisition of novel \u201cvirulence factors\u201d (or deletion of other genetic elements) can rapidly lead to the emergence of new diseases or enhanced virulence in some pathogens. For molecular pathologists the concept of virulence is similar to the traditional definition of plant pathologists, i.e. the infectivity: a strain is virulent if it is able to infect a host.7 This definition could be traced back to the work of Pasteur, for whom \u201cvirulent cultures killed, attenuated ones did not\u201d (Mendelsohn 2002, 3\u201326, p. 5). A more classical definition is the ability to generate symptoms. In both cases, virulence is an all or nothing trait; it is qualitative and not quantitative. Note that these definitions have the advantage that they can be translated at different levels, for instance at the cellular level, where virulence can be the ability to infect cells.",

            "text": "The ecological or exogenous style adopts another approach to disease emergence, virulence, and evolution. Often described as a two-step process, disease emergence requires the introduction of a pathogen within a population followed by its successful dissemination (Morse 1991, 392\u20133). The \u201crules of viral traffic\u201d (Morse 1991) dictate that both steps usually result from one or several changes in the environment, not from a modification in the biological characteristics of the pathogen. For instance, in 1976 a change in the air conditioning system in a hotel in Philadelphia facilitated the spread of Legionellosis, a bacterium usually commensal to humans, which caused an outbreak of fever and pneumonia now known as Legionnaire\u2019s disease. However, there are cases supporting a biological explanation of emergence, for instance when a maladapted strain mutates into a well-adapted strain before going extinct (Antia et al. 2003). The trade-off model developed by Robert May and Roy Anderson, and independently by Paul Ewald, in the early 1980s currently underpins the bulk of the theoretical research on host-pathogen\u2019s interactions in evolutionary ecology.8 Put simply, the model postulates the existence of ecological trade-offs between a number of epidemiological variables. As a consequence, the evolution of virulence becomes linked to several factors: host resistance and recovery rate, pathogen transmission rate, the timing of infection life-history events and population density, among others. The trade-off model permits the investigation of the role of environmental changes broadly conceived (including within and between hosts selection) and selective pressures acting on pathogen transmission, and thus on the level of virulence (Alizon 2014).",

            "text": "While molecular geneticists quickly adopted the concepts of virulence genes and pathogenicity islands, evolutionary ecologists working with the trade-off model continued to regard them with suspicion (see Poulin and Combes 1999).9 We think this suspicion is probably due to the way virulence is defined. For evolutionary biologists, virulence typically is a quantitative trait that can be measured. Therefore, genes that are sufficient to render a pathogen virulent and essentially act as a qualitative trait are difficult to fit into the picture. Furthermore, there is no such thing as pathogen virulence alone in ecology. Virulence, typically, is a \u201cshared trait\u201d that results from the interaction between a host genotype, a parasite genotype and their environment. In other words, some parasite genotypes might only cause virulence when they infect some host genotypes or some parasites may only be virulent to hosts in certain contexts (e.g. starvation). For evolutionary biologists and ecologists, virulence is the harm a pathogen does to its host, i.e. the reduction in host fitness due to the infection (Read 1994). Fitness is notoriously difficult to evaluate but arguably the two most common measures are lifespan and fecundity.10 One problem is that a pathogen strain described as being very virulent in vitro could turn out to be mild in vivo (and vice-versa). Furthermore, recent work shows that levels of virulence can actually be the result of the immune system\u2019s over-response itself (see Graham et al. 2005 for a review). In the end, evolutionary ecologists focus on a combination of within-host processes when they refer to virulence. Importantly, this does not mean that they disregard the molecular processes that lead to virulence. For instance, studies have shown that immune-pathology contributions to virulence lead to a different evolutionary outcome than \u201cvirulence factors\u201d produced by pathogens (Alizon and van Baalen 2005).",

            "text": "Recent explanations advanced to account for the rapid changes in virulence during the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic reflect the polarity between ecological and molecular explicative strategies. Applying the trade-off model to the 1918\u201319 pandemic, Paul Ewald has argued that the proximity of soldiers in the trenches, the hospitals, the transport, and the military camps during World War I greatly facilitated transmission of the virus from host to host. High viral replication rate by natural selection was therefore favoured, which resulted in exceptionally high virulence and the high level of mortality of the pandemic (Ewald 1991, 1994, 1996). But since the late 1990s, molecular pathology has provided an alternative viewpoint on the evolution of virulence in the pandemic. The identification of the viral RNA from frozen bodies and wax blocks in the U.S. and its further sequencing has led to a renewed emphasis on genetic and molecular determinants of the virus as being the most important cause of this dramatic event (see Holmes 2004). According to molecular pathologist Jeffrey Taubenberger, one of the leading scientists involved in reviving the 1918 influenza strain, \u201cit is possible that a mutation or reassortment occurred in the late summer of 1918, resulting in significantly enhanced virulence\u201d (2005, 90). Taubenberger believes that this \u201cunique feature\u201d of the 1918 virus \u2013 its extreme virulence \u2013 \u201ccould be revealed in its [genetic] sequence\u201d (2005, 90). Both approaches \u2013 the exogenous and the endogenous \u2013 evolved along parallel lines during most of the twentieth century, and though the concept of emerging infectious diseases brought them closer to one another in the 1990s, we show how they remain in tension (M\u00e9thot 2012b). Before describing in more details the potentials and limits of these two perspectives we first describe significant aspects of the biology of influenza viruses.",

            "text": "The natural history and ecology of influenza A virus has been extensively studied (Webster 1999, 1993; Webster et al. 1992; Webster and Rott 1987). The virus\u2019 natural reservoir is the wild waterfowl, as supported by the fact that species of wild duck are not affected by the virus and remain \u201chealthy\u201d. The virus replicates inside the host, mostly in the intestinal tract, and is then washed into the ponds where ducks live and breed (Webster 1993). The relative harmlessness of this relationship is similar to the way myxoma virus is adapted to its natural host, the South American rabbit (see Fenner and Fantini 1999). The family tree of influenza viruses contains two genera: one that includes influenza A and B viruses and the other influenza C viruses. The two genera are distinct in terms of host range and virulence factors. Type A is the most common of all, and can infect a wide range of hosts, including, pigs, horses, seals, whales and birds. This type of virus is also the most redoubtable as it has the potential to cause pandemics. Type B is believed to infect only humans (especially young children) and Type C (another genus) can infect both humans and swine. In this sense influenza can hardly be regarded as a \u201csingle disease\u201d (Johnson 2006, 10).",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are enveloped negative strand RNA viruses and belong to the genus Orthomyxoviridae (Taubenberger 2005). The virus of the Spanish flu pandemic belongs to the type A influenza, known as H1N1. Influenza A and B viruses contain eight discrete gene segments, coding for at least one protein. The surface of influenza A viruses is covered by three types of proteins hemmagglutinin (HA), neuraminidases (NA) and matrix 2 (M2). The structural configuration of HA proteins is that of a triangular spike. These spikes allow the virus to bind to red blood cells by causing the latter to agglutinate (i.e. hemmagglutinin). They facilitate entrance into the host and they trigger the infective processes. Once the infection is over, antibodies responding to hemmagglutinin spikes are formed, allowing the immune system to recognize the signature of the viral strain in case of another infection episode. In contrast, neuraminidases (NA) also form spikes on the surface coat of the virus but their function is to cleave glycoproteins into two and to facilitate the propagation of the virus from cell to cell. NA proteins open-up cells for infection, so to speak. Antiviral drugs target NA in order to block their exit, and antibodies to NA are also produced after the infection. Influenza A viruses are further subdivided into serological types, which is the genetic characterization of the surface glycoproteins HA and NA. 16 HA and 9 NA proteins have been described to date. These surface glycoproteins define the virus\u2019 identity in terms of what the immune system detects and attacks. The different major families of flu are combinations of the two, hence the designation \u201cH5N1\u201d for the recent threat. The 1918 virus was H1N1.",

            "text": "The genes coding for these glycoproteins can reassort (i.e. reshuffle) due to two processes known as antigenic drift and antigenic shift. The former consists in the accumulation of point mutations in the genome of the virus, modifying both the shape and the electric charge of viral surface antigens and preventing their recognition by the antibodies of the host that were developed in reaction to previous exposures to the virus. The need to update the influenza vaccines every year illustrates the evolutionary success of antigenic drift. In contrast, antigenic shifts refer to the introduction of whole or part of influenza genes into viruses that circulate among human populations. This form of genetic reassortment or reshuffling occurs especially in swine that act as \u201cmixing vessels\u201d for the viral strains and are considered the intermediate host between birds and humans (Webster and Kawaoka 1994). The introduction of a new hemmagglutinin gene (HA) is often hailed as the responsible factor for increased virulence (Bush 2007). The fast reassortment of nucleotides and the high rate of mutation in influenza viruses result in influenza posing a continual threat for human and animal health. As a result, influenza is regarded as being a continually \u201cre-emerging\u201d disease (Webby and Webster 2003; Webster and Kawaoka 1994), and international efforts are made to understand why the 1918\u201319 pandemic was so exceptionally virulent. The motivation behind these global efforts in gaining a better understanding of this pandemic is to draw lessons from the past in order to be better prepared for the rise of future influenza and other viral pandemics.",

            "text": "Recorded history suggests that the first influenza pandemic occurred in 1580. Beginning in Asia, it rapidly spread to Africa, America and to Europe. Between the eighteenth and the nineteenth century, medical historians identified (at least) 8 pandemics out of 25 epidemics of influenza A virus (Beveridge 1992). The most devastating pandemic, however, occurred in 1918\u201319 (Fig. 1).11 The emergence of the (misnamed) \u201cSpanish\u201d influenza pandemic of 1918\u201319 is the first of the three major influenza pandemics that occurred during the past century \u2013 and is regarded as one of the most devastating episodes in medical history (McNeill 1976).12 Once described as \u201cthe biggest unsolved problem of theoretical epidemiology and public health practice\u201d (Burnet and Clark 1942), its consequences rendered many wary about the emergence of respiratory disease pandemics in a near future (Webby and Webster 2003). In addition to the 1918\u201319 pandemic, two other major influenza pandemics occurred in 1957\u201358 (\u201cAsian\u201d influenza, H2N2) and in 1968 (\u201cHong Kong\u201d influenza, H3N2). The death of David Lewis, a soldier at the military camp of Fort Dix in the U.S., and the infection of a few hundreds of others in 1976 led public health authorities to believe they were facing a new influenza epidemic. Amidst some scepticism, vaccines against H1N1 flu were quickly stockpiled as President Ford gave the green light to mass vaccination. However, no epidemic occurred while a number of vaccinated individuals came down with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an autoimmune disease, a few weeks later (see Krause 1998). One year later, in 1977, the H1N1 virus, which had disappeared in 1957, reappeared (the so-called \u201cRussian\u201d influenza) in the Soviet Union and spread to Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, and within 10 months had reached South America and New Zealand. The virus was similar to a virus isolated in the U.S. in 1950 at Fort Warren and had perhaps been accidentally released from a laboratory located in the former Soviet Union (Berche 2012, 127). Affecting mostly individuals born after 1957, this virus coexisted with the H3N2 virus until 2009, when a new variant of H1N1 emerged (the \u201cSwine\u201d flu, which is the latest pandemic) that replaced the 1977 variant. In comparison to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the Hong Kong and the Asian pandemics were more \u201cbenign\u201d, the former causing between 1.5 and 2 million deaths, and the latter 1 million. The recent H5N1 pandemic caused a few deaths only between 1997 and 2004 (Taubenberger 2005, 87). Despite the (crucial) facts that antibiotics were available during the second two pandemics, and that medical care had significantly improved and was more efficient after 1950, this raises the question: why was the 1918\u201319 pandemic so deadly to humans?\n\n",

            "text": "A first important aspect of the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic is its likely Western origin. In part because of its extensive pig-duck farming industry, China was previously singled out as the possible origin of most influenza pandemics. However, whereas most pandemics to have befallen man have come from China (Morse 1993, 17) the \u201cSpanish\u201d flu originated (likely) from France as early as 1916 causing acute respiratory symptoms closely resembling the phenotype of the disease during the 1918\u201319 flu pandemic (Oxford et al. 2002, 2005). Some have recently argued that there was an early wave of influenza in New York between February and April 1918 (Olson et al. 2005). The precise geographical origins of the 1918 pandemic are still a matter of debate, however.13 The world\u2019s deadliest flu pandemic kicked off in October 1918 and in just a few months, the virus killed between 30 and 40 million people (Philips and Killingray 2003; Johnson and Mueller 2002; Crosby 1989; some estimate deaths to number about 50 million, see McNeil 1976). According to the \u201cthree waves theory\u201d, influenza swept through all five continents in three recurrences. The first wave (or the \u201cspring wave\u201d) of the flu started in March in the U.S. (Mid West) before moving to Europe, then to Asia and North Africa before reaching Australia in July 1918. While morbidity was high, mortality was not higher than the habitual norm (Reid et al. 2001, 81). The second wave (or \u201cfall wave\u201d), however, was highly devastating and rapidly went extinct after causing millions of deaths worldwide, with peaks in October and November. It started in late August 1918 and within 1 week reports of the virus came from distant cities, including Boston (U.S.), Freetown (Africa), and Brest (France). On many accounts, this second wave lasted until November. The speed at which the virus circulated makes it difficult to pinpoint one specific location as being \u201cthe\u201d source of the pandemic but a Western origin appears to be the most plausible hypothesis according to the available evidence. Reports indicated a further third wave that hit in the first months of 1919 but was much less severe (Burnet and Clark 1942; Barry 2004a). However, the three waves pattern of the pandemic is not uniformly applicable to all countries; for instance Australia experienced a single occurrence of the flu pandemic (Johnson and Mueller 2002; Morens and Taubenberger 2009).",

Symptoms lasted generally between 2 and 4 days and could, more rarely, be extended up to 2 weeks. The respiratory disease was characterized by fever, body pain, and severe headaches. Without the possibility of treating patients with antibiotics, bacteria turned \u201cthose vital organs [lungs] into sacks of fluids [\u2026] effectively drowning the patient\u201d (Philips and Killingray 2003, 5). People therefore died within just a few days of hemorrhagic pulmonary oedema and other lung afflictions (Bush 2007; see also Taubenberger et al. 2000). Related to this, the second striking aspect of the 1918 influenza pandemic is the young age of the victims, which was qualitatively distinctive: most of them were men, supposedly healthy, of between 20\u201340 years old (some say 25\u201335), irrespective of whether the country was involved in the war or not. Instead of forming a U shaped mortality curve, the shape of the 1918 pandemic was W shaped. An additional peak (the central peak in the W) represents the male victims of the flu. Figure 2 (above) shows the U shaped curve of 1917 and the W shaped one of 1918. The distribution of deaths on this curve reflects the virulence of the pandemic and underlines the pattern of mortality of a group usually not affected by seasonal flu.\n\n",

In the United States alone only, annual death tolls related to seasonal influenza are estimated to be about 30,000 individuals (Thompson et al. 2003). Seasonal outbreaks of influenza normally last a few weeks and then disappear abruptly; they result from influenza viruses present in human populations that are able to infect individuals due to antigenic drift. On occasions, however, the virus can infect up to 40 % of the world population. During these pandemic years, in contrast, the number of deaths rises way above the average, claiming millions of victims all around the globe. In the course of seasonal epidemics strains of influenza type A and B can sometimes coexist, if at different frequencies among populations. So why was the Spanish influenza so devastating? Recent work in molecular biology argues that the waves pattern, the group mortality, and the clinical course of the disease \u201cmay find their explanation in genetic features of the 1918 virus\u201d (Reid et al. 2001, 86). Others, however, defend the view that the changes in virulence result from significant changes in the wider ecological context in which the outbreak occurred (Ewald 1994). In the next sections, we review both ecological-environmental and molecular-led approaches to this problem, we indicate some of the limitations of each and we suggest that a better integration of those perspectives would lead to positive outcomes regarding prediction, prevention, and preparedness in the face of other similar influenza and other bacterial or viral pandemics.",

His work was based on the concept of \u201ccultural vectors\u201d and on the assumption that parasites that do not rely on host mobility for transmission should evolve towards higher levels of virulence. In Ewald\u2019s terminology, a cultural vector is \u201ca set of characteristics that allow transmission from immobilized hosts to susceptible when at least one of the characteristics is some aspects of human cultures\u201d (1994; 68; see also Ewald 1988). In the case of waterborne transmission, cultural vectors include contaminated bed sheets in hospitals, sewage systems carrying the pathogens, medical staff disposing of the contaminated water to water supplies, and so on. Waterborne diseases can become more virulent because they do not rely on host mobility for transmission (see Ewald 1994, 69), that is, the host can be isolated and still be highly contagious; a \u201chealthy\u201d host is not needed for transmission (in contrast with what was postulated by the conventional wisdom). Note that implicit in his reasoning is the idea that more virulent pathogens have a higher transmission because they produce more spores.",

More precisely, he argued that the exceptionally high virulence resulted from rapid passages of the virus in soldiers, recruits and wounded people in hospitals during the war. Though a similar explanation had already been heralded in the 1930s\u20131940s, it had to be supplemented with an essential \u201cevolutionary mechanism\u201d: the classical explanation is based on the analogy with rapid passages of a viral strain through a series of animals (i.e. guinea pigs) in a laboratory that can enhance virulence (as Pasteur et al. (1994 [1881]) had experimentally demonstrated, see Mendelsohn (2002)). Ewald\u2019s argument is that, just like biological vectors, cultural vectors enhance virulence by facilitating transmission. The central point about the serial passages is that it removes the \u201crequirement that hosts be mobile to transmit their infections\u201d (Ewald 1994, 115). Once this obstacle is lifted nothing (a priori) stands in the way of a steep increase in virulence. In a laboratory context, experimenters inoculate different animals with artificially selected viral strains; in the field, this selection process results from another cultural vector, namely the warfare conditions.",

As postulated by the trade-off model, the density of the population (S) influences the level of observed virulence in a biological system (at least for short-term evolutionary dynamics). In this case, the high density resulted from the proximity of the soldiers in the trenches, in hospitals, on trains bringing soldiers to the front, and in military camps. In turn, this resulted in the unusual situation that immobilized individuals who normally should not be able to infect new people (because they would be isolated in a hospital) were now easily able to transmit the infections. Similarly, removing wounded soldiers from the trenches and bringing them to war hospitals facilitated transmission. The constant arrival of new susceptible individuals into the population through transport networks resulted in maintaining a high density of infected people; and as a consequence, an equally high level of virulence. Related to this is the idea that spatial structure in the host population affects virulence evolution. If hosts tend to have few contacts among them, e.g. because they live in isolation (the technical term to describe such a population is \u201cviscous\u201d), then a parasite has to keep its host alive sufficiently long enough to be transmitted. On the other hand, if the population is \u201cwell mixed\u201d, host encounter rate is not an issue \u2013 as in the 1918\u201319 example \u2013 and parasites can afford to be more virulent (Boots and Sasaki 1999).",

For other evolutionary ecologists, Ewald\u2019s cost-benefit argument is too adaptationist \u2013 i.e. virulence is depicted as being always adaptive for the parasite. As a consequence, \u201calternatives such as virulence being non-adaptive, or virulence being a consequence of short-sighted, within-host evolution of the parasite are ignored\u201d (Bull and Levin 1994, 1470). Evolutionary theory states that virulence can be directly selected but it can also be coincidental with other infection or biological processes (Levin and Ed\u00e9n 1990), and in some cases it can be potentially maladaptive. This point connects to one of the usual critiques levered against the trade-off hypothesis, namely that it is very verbal and lacks empirical support (Levin and Bull 1994; Lipsitch and Moxon 1997). However, the lack of support largely comes from the difficulty of finding an appropriate biological system; arguably, when people have looked for a trade-off in a host parasite system that satisfies the assumptions of the theory they have found it (Alizon et al. 2009). There is actually a tendency to challenge the trade-off hypothesis using host-parasite systems that do not fit the underlying model (see Alizon and Michalakis (2011) for an illustration).",

When taken into account, this concern weakens the claim that high transmission in the case of the 1918 pandemic has favoured high virulence because transmission was lower than with most infectious diseases. R\n0 are typically variable but given Ewald\u2019s argument it would be expected to find a high transmissibility rate between the virus and its hosts. In turn, this would support the claim that natural selection acted on transmission in ways that increased the overall level of virulence. Moreover, the trade-off assumes a homogeneous population and was developed for diseases transmitted by contact like influenza. However, a comparison of R\n0 between the 1918\u201319 pandemic with other major disease outbreaks in recent history, or with influenza pandemics in general, does not reveal a significantly higher transmissibility in the case of the Spanish influenza. Calculations suggest that the basic reproductive rate of viruses during influenza pandemics ranges from 2 and 3 (Mills et al. 2004). In comparison, the reproductive rate during an outbreak of measles in England in 1947\u20131950 was between 13 and 14 secondary infections; a pertussis outbreak in Maryland (U.S.) in 1913 yielded a reproductive rate between 7 and 8; and a mumps outbreak in the Netherlands during the 1970s produced between 11 and 14 secondary infections in a wholly susceptible populations (Anderson and May 1991, 70). In the case of the 1918 pandemic, more recent calculations suggest that R0 was perhaps equal to 2 (Morse 2007, 7314). Finally, a recent article on the transmission of influenza in households during the pandemic (Fraser et al. 2011) used historical data and mathematical models to study the rate of transmission. The authors found a relatively low level of transmission between individuals and suggest that prior immunity to the virus should be considered. Though transmissibility may, theoretically, have been fostered so that the virus reached unprecedented virulence, the trade-off model alone does not fully explain why it was so deadly.",

To make his argument more compelling, Ewald needs additional data that accurately and empirically describe the environmental conditions in the trenches. For instance, how close were the troops? How many soldiers were there? And more importantly, what was the rate of transmission between hosts? If a similar study to Fraser et al. (2011) could be conducted on viral transmission in the trenches it would perhaps yield interesting insights into the changes of virulence. To date, no epidemiological data exists that could serve as a basis to model the dynamic patterns, however. Though Ewald\u2019s account seems to suffer from a number of theoretical and empirical problems, it nevertheless supports the argument that properties other than those of the virus need to be taken into account and that without them we would are not able to fully understand the changes in virulence that occurred. As he remarked, progress towards the evolution of virulence \u201chas largely been limited to improve understanding of the genetic mechanisms of antigenic changes and the influences of these changes and host immunity on the occurrence of epidemics\u201d (Ewald 1991, 15). The recent work of microbiologist John Oxford on what we could call the \u201cWar Hypothesis\u201d reinforces Ewald\u2019s conclusion by feeding in some of the missing empirical and historical data.",

His comments were intended to provide support to a paper delivered earlier by Edwin Kilbourne, an American virologist who specialised in influenza, who had argued that the greater virulence of the 1918 pandemic was due to a combination of \u201cthe emergence of a new antigenic type in a population with little specific immunity\u201d and \u201cthe dislocation of and crowding of wartime which favoured not only dissemination and high dosage of virus but spread of bacterial pathogens to an unusual degree\u201d (Kilbourne 1960, 74). Kilbourne argued that the \u201cstudy of the host and his environment are more crucial to the interpretation of virulence than laboratory study of the virus itself\u201d (1960, 71). Attempts to locate the cause of virulence inside specific genes or to relate them to other mobile, structural elements (i.e. plasmids) were met with scepticism by people like Wilson, Kilbourne, and Burnet who were interested in large-scale ecological processes and in the formation of evolutionary equilibriums between hosts and parasites. Ecologically minded biologists were also reacting against the growing place of molecular biology since the 1960s and its reductionist vision of the life process and the life sciences. This is how we can interpret Kilbourne who scornfully remarked that \u201cironically in this era of molecular biology, the control of no infectious disease has yet depended on understanding its molecular mechanisms\u201d (1977, 1228).",

As part of a project funded by the University of Iowa, he travelled in 1951 to a small Inuit village whose population was decimated by the 1918 pandemic, which had killed 70 people in a week, a loss amounting to 85 % of the inhabitants. Hoping to find preserved corpses buried in the permafrost hosting traces of the infectious organism, Hultin travelled to the Seward Peninsular of Alaska in a village known as Teller Mission (Taubenberger 2003). He extracted lung tissue from several bodies he exhumed from the village cemetery, but all attempts to culture remaining traces of the virus of influenza from these samples failed to give any result. Forty years later, in the context of the Human Genome Project, the idea of resurrecting the influenza virus surfaced again, this time powered by genomic technology.",

In their first article, Taubenberger et al. randomly selected 28 cases of paraffin-embedded tissues collected from army servicemen who died during the pandemic for pathological review, searching for symptoms indicative of death by influenza. Most of the individuals examined died of secondary pulmonary infection, which was a common feature of victims of the pandemic. In effect, bacterial infection very often works together with the influenza virus in delineating the clinical picture of the disease. One case, indeed (1918 case1), could be linked to viral pneumonia and exhibited symptoms of acute pneumonia in the left lung combined with an acute form of bronchiolitis in the right lung, a pathological characteristic typical of a \u201cprimary viral pneumonia\u201d.",

It was concluded that the genetic sequence of this strain was different from every other influenza strain, and that it was more closely related to strains found in birds than in mammals (Taubenberger et al. 1997). This partial analysis of the genetic map of human influenza was soon followed by a complete sequencing of the hemmagglutinin gene (HA) \u2013 a gene long believed to be \u201cpivotal\u201d in the pathogenicity of influenza A viruses (Webster and Rott 1987; see also Cox and Bender 1995). This gene codes for a protein located on the surface of the virus that plays a crucial role in allowing the virus to bind to host cells. If the virus is able to spread to another species this means it has somehow (through antigenic drift) acquired a new protein that enables it to bind on a different receptor. However, the team did not identify a mutation of the cleave site of the hemmagglutinin gene (Reid et al. 2001; Taubenberger et al. 1997).",

Yet Taubenberger was forced to recognize that \u201cthe 1918 strain (as confirmed by all three cases) does not possess a mutation at this site\u201d (Ibid.; see also Reid et al. 1999; Stevens et al. 2004). In the light of this conclusion, virologist and influenza expert Robert Webster wrote that the secret of the Spanish influenza will \u201cremain elusive\u201d. Webster commented that such \u201cbiological properties\u201d [i.e. virulence] may \u201cnot be resolved\u201d and suggested that the results of the sequencing project could only provide a partial explanation of this phenomenon. Indeed, for him \u201cthe entire gene sequence is unlikely to reveal the secret of the high pathogenicity of the 1918 Spanish virus\u201d (Webster 1999, 1165). While Taubenberger\u2019s paper ends with some remarks about the complex, likely polygenic, nature of virulence determinants in a particular strain, it also concludes \u2013 contra Webster \u2013 with the hope that more sequencing would \u201cshed additional light on the nature of the 1918 influenza virus\u201d (Reid et al. 1999, 1656).",

Virologists Hideo Goto and Yoshihiro Kawaoka published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science on a novel mechanism for the acquisition of virulence by human influenza A viruses. There, they argued that a change in another major protein \u2013 neuraminidase \u2013 able to increase the cleavage of HA could bring about higher levels of virulence. In fact, Goto and Kawaoka even suggested that a change in a single amino-acid sequestering plasminogen might facilitate the cleavage of NA. The authors were cautious, however, stating they \u201cdo not conclude that single mutation will convert nonplasminogen-binding NAs to efficient plasminogen binders, thus rendering the virus highly virulent\u201d (1998, 10228). Yet, they acknowledged at the same time that it is \u201ctempting to speculate that the 1918 pandemic strain [\u2026] may have acquired its unprecedented virulence from the mechanism we describe\u201d (Ibid). But such a change in amino-acid was also absent (or at least not observed) in the 1918 neuraminidase sequence (Taubenberger 2003, 45; 1988; see also Reid et al. 2000; Kawaoka and Watanabe 2011). Also, similar to Taubenberger, Goto and Kawaoka concluded with a plea for \u201cfurther sequencing\u201d, in order \u201cto address the issue of its [the 1918\u201319 pandemic] unprecedented virulence\u201d (Goto and Kawaoka 1998, 10228).",

For instance, infected mice show 39,000 times more virus particles after infection with the 1918 strain than with other viral strains like the Texas virus, and infected mice died after 6 days following infection with the 1918 strain, while all survived when infected with the Texas virus (von Bubnoff 2005, 794).

            "text": "As the current head of the Viral Pathogenesis and Evolution Section at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Taubenberger\u2019s work is underpinned by evolutionary considerations. But what aspects of his work exactly are evolutionary or Darwinian? Philosopher Michael Ruse has long pointed out that the term \u201cDarwinism\u201d carries two broad meanings. It can be used firstly in a metaphysical sense to characterize change, development and transformation in the natural world. In this sense, the concept of Darwinism is older than Darwin himself. Another sense of Darwinism is important to acknowledge. In this second sense, Darwinism is a scientific notion that emerges in the work of naturalist Charles Darwin and refers to the fact of evolution, the paths (phylogenies) of evolution, and the mechanism (natural selection) of evolution (Ruse 1992, 77). This distinction between path and mechanism maps on the more traditional distinction between patterns and processes in evolutionary biology mentioned above. The research of Taubenberger and Ewald \u2013 and more generally molecular pathology and evolutionary ecology \u2013 displays these two aspects of Darwinian theory. Arguably, both accept evolution as a \u201cfact\u201d. However, the former is more interested in the \u201cpatterns\u201d of evolution and uses evolutionary thinking to unravel the biological (including genetic) and adaptive processes that led to an increase in virulence. In contrast, Ewald focuses on the \u201cprocess\u201d of evolution \u2013 natural selection \u2013 as it occurred in various environments and populations of hosts and pathogens. As described above, Taubenberger\u2019s research focuses on precise and minute description of the small steps that allow viruses to infect more than one species; this work painstakingly tracks changes in nucleotides and charts the genealogical relationships between several strains of influenza. Ewald and Oxford, in contrast, take a broader view and ask why those mutations were selected, what were the selective pressures that drove them to be passed on and conserved in the gene pool, and especially, what is the role of the milieu, largely understood, in shaping virulence.",

In other words, the second approach, the ecological one, seeks not only to describe organic changes leading to the formation of new viral strains, for example, but also attempts to give an account of the adaptive value of these transformations in the particular milieu in which the microorganisms lived, reproduced and eventually died. These two components of evolutionary theory \u2013 patterns and processes \u2013 are well known in the history of biology. Evolutionary ecologists nowadays might want to argue that Taubenberger is primarily interested in constructing and comparing distinct phylogenetic trees, no matter what the significance of their (evolutionary) relationship may be.16 We think that the two aspects of evolutionary theory discussed here, however, reflect more broadly the existence of two distinct styles of scientific practices in biomedicine. The difficulty in addressing both aspects of the theory at the same time is indicative of a genuine tension between distinct explanatory strategies where knowledge claims are made according to different assumptions as to what counts as explanatory.",

Yet it is striking to note that Reid, Taubenberger et al.

Proposals in genomics, synthetic biology, and other cognate fields with a strong engineering approach to biology can highlight potential findings and even future applications, some of which are likely to be patentable and thus rapidly rentable from a financial point of view. In brief, promoting more sequencing is likely to provide additional research money.

Derivative of Ian Hacking\u2019s concept of \u201cstyles of reasoning\u201d \u2013 itself inspired by Alistair Crombie\u2019s \u201cstyle of scientific thinking in the European tradition\u201d\u2013 (Hacking 1992; Crombie 1994), the notion of \u201cstyle\u201d typically refers to the historical formation of distinctive practices and methodologies in science. Styles frame what counts as evidence, relevant questions to ask, truth-value, and sound explanation in distinct research and/or cultural contexts. Alongside the development of individual styles of practice one finds the emergence of new standards for measurements, objectivity, proof, and so on (Hacking 1992). Though styles are flexible they are not loose or relativist categories; they admit rules, systems of norms, stabilization techniques, and methods of justification. As they progressively become stabilised over time and entrenched within scientific activities, however, the very existence of styles of reasoning and their historical development become taken for granted. While the notion of style is often employed to analyse scientific controversies (Amsterdamska 2004; Fujimura and Chou 1994), it is interesting to note here that the two styles at play in the present case study have grown in relative ignorance of each other. Going back to the missing mutations, we can see that even though Taubenberger\u2019s programme did not provide the answers it sought it could not be halted hastily, especially after gathering immense publicity and funding. On the contrary, it is expected that these scientists, working within their style of practice, continue to do so until all possibilities of finding the key to the exceptional virulence have been looked at and examined in detail. From this point of view, their persistence in seeking a complete molecular explanation makes sense \u2013 even if, from a public health and biosecurity point of view, their research raises ethical concerns about the development of dual-use technologies (Rappert 2007). Moreover, the results obtained on the biology of influenza A viruses and the methods developed by Taubenberger and his team now enable worldwide researchers to better understand the molecular differences between various influenza strains.",

The current gap between ecological and molecular explanations, as it emerged in the present case, may be due to the fact that functional explanations such as those constructed in molecular biology tend to appear \u201cself-sufficient\u201d, as historian and biologist Michel Morange recently put it (2011). This sort of epistemological obstacle means that, for many, there is no (obvious) need to complement molecular explanations with ecological considerations. To say that integration between mathematical modelling and molecular microbiological approaches has failed in this case would be going too far, however. Indeed, integration of ecological and molecular approaches of virulence evolution has not even been seriously attempted so far. Also, it would be misleading to suggest that molecular pathologists wholly ignore the environmental perspectives on virulence evolution and emerging diseases.17 Yet when they do take them into account, the result does not necessarily amount to a better integration of data, theories, or methods but reveals, instead, the heights of disciplinary boundaries and the valuing of one style of practice over another. For example, in one of the last publications of Taubenberger and his colleagues at the National Institute of Health, the authors concluded that the diminution of severity of influenza pandemics over time \u201cis surely due in part to advances in medicine and public health, but it may also reflect viral evolutionary choices that favor optimal transmissibility with minimal pathogenicity - a virus that kills its host too fast or sends them to bed is not optimally transmissible\u201d (Morens et al. 2009, 229; emphasis added). In other words, the biological interests of the virus will best be served by evolving lower virulence over time in order to facilitate transmission to new hosts, an explanation that rests on the conventional wisdom rejected by most evolutionary ecologists who advocate the theoretical trade-off model but that is still defended by some microbiologists. This may come as a surprise given that Anthony Fauci, on of the authors of the paper, and current head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has long criticized this view (see Fauci 2005). It shows, however, that branches of sciences in which the same problem is addressed, through distinct methodologies, can be surprisingly disconnected and separated by epistemic gaps, professional or institutional barriers. In other words, integration is no easy goal to achieve.",

A recent case of potential dual-use consequences in influenza research involving a group of researchers led by Ron Fouchier in the Netherlands and by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, from Madison, in the U.S, led in January 2012 to a 60 day suspension of research on influenza and virulent diseases, following consensus to delay publication.20 Both teams had submitted a paper, to Science and Nature respectively, describing the methodology employed to artificially render an H5N1 influenza strain transmissible between ferrets (which is, arguably, a reliable indicator of possible transmission to humans) due to a mutation on the hemmagglutinin protein. Both studies have now been published (Imai et al. 2012; Herfst et al. 2012). As an aside, it is interesting to see that these two studies, although undoubtedly driven by molecular biology questions, were based on classical approaches in evolutionary ecology known as serial passage experiments (Ebert 1998).",

The concept of emerging diseases has helped focus international efforts to contain infectious diseases within well-defined geographical and temporal limitations. With the (re)creation of the 1918\u201319 influenza strain and others (e.g. Yersinia pestis, polio virus, H5N1), a different form of biological threat arises and it requires different political, institutional, and legal response mechanisms. Indeed, while the threat of emerging infections was mostly perceived as coming from outside Northern-hemisphere countries, it now appears to be growing from within the heartland of Western countries itself. Instead of stressing possible disease invasions in previously unexposed countries (or with only low incidence of a particular disease), recently developed technologies in synthetic biology and genomics have opened-up the possibility to artificially create new diseases, or to resurrect old ones such as the plague, the influenza strain responsible for the 1918 pandemic, and the polio virus (Bos et al. 2011; Taubenberger 2005; Tumpey et al. 2005; Celo et al. 2002; Rosengard et al. 2002). On the other hand, it might be argued that new variants appear constantly and the risk of a laboratory accident might be comparable to what happens naturally in the field. Moreover, while dual-use is a characteristic of most life sciences nowadays (Atlas 2009), only a small number of experiments and experimental practices are, overall, seen as posing real threats to public health and global security (for a recent analysis see Aucouturier 2011; Morens et al. 2012). Finally, it is worth noting that dual-use technologies \u2013 like scientific research more generally \u2013 are often characterized by unexpected findings such as, for instance, the accidental discovery that a modified virus injected into mice was lethal to otherwise vaccinated animals (Jackson et al. 2001). As is often the case in science, the experimental system designed to answer certain questions opens-up theoretical and practical possibilities that could sometimes not be envisaged at the outset (Rheinberger 1997). If unpredictability and unforeseen results are truly the essence of scientific research, dual-use technologies are then an unavoidable trade-off to deal with, a point that reinforces the need to develop appropriate governance responses to biomedical research programmes on pathogens and potentially pathogenic organisms (M\u00e9thot 2014). More generally, those new research avenues underline the need for the development of a \u201cculture of responsibility\u201d (NSABB 2011) in the life sciences, that is, a new ethos to address and balance questions of biosecurity and risk with scientific autonomy and progress, among others.",

Researchers on ancient pathogens using high throughput technologies have recently claimed to identify the causal organism of the Black Death (Yersinia pestis) in the fourteenth century and the sources of its virulence in the form of a single plasmid (Schuenemann et al. 2001). However, determining why an organism is pathogenic or what makes it a pathogen is not straightforward and is rarely based on a specific structural characteristic alone (M\u00e9thot 2012c). As microbiologist Charles Nicolle once said (1930), virulence is the expression of a \u201cmosaic of powers\u201d resulting from a constellation of factors that are irreducible to any particular structure and must be understood against a broad biological and even historical background. It is interesting to note, therefore, that the same team went on to revise its position in a subsequent article by pointing out the inherent limitations of molecular-oriented explanation and, furthermore, emphasized the need to widen the explanation and integrate ecological factors as well. They write:\nRegardless, although no extant Y. pestis strain possesses the same genetic profile as our ancient organism, our data suggest that few changes in known virulence-associated genes have accrued in the organism\u2019s 660 years of evolution as a human pathogen, further suggesting that its perceived increased virulence in history may not be due to novel fixed point mutations detectable via the analytical approach described here. At our current resolution, we posit that molecular changes in pathogens are but one component of a constellation of factors contributing to changing infectious disease prevalence and severity, where genetics of the host population, climate, vector dynamics, social conditions and synergistic interactions with concurrent diseases should be foremost in discussions of population susceptibility to infectious disease and host\u2013pathogen relationships with reference to Y. pestis infections (Bos et al. 2011; emphasis added).\n",

More precisely, the more recent study emphasizes that a full understanding of the evolution of virulence requires a multi-dimensional framework that encompasses host resistance, ecological factors, and the interactions between the different diseases occuring in a well-defined geographical area over a specific time period. To go beyond the limitations of analytical approaches that investigate one disease at a time, a synthetic and global approach is necessary in order to understand more broadly the evolution of emerging diseases that compose the past, present, and future of any \u201cpathocenosis\u201d (Grmek 1969).",

            "text": "To conclude, our analyses of the case of the Spanish influenza pandemic show that there is an irreducible tension in studying the phenomenon of virulence comparatively across the sciences: one can either look for determinants of pathogenic power analytically, that is from within microorganisms, or synthetically at the level of host-pathogen interactions in a given ecological environment. Both approaches face limitations and neither appears to be sufficient to account for a complex phenomenon like the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic. Besides, each level of analysis has its own ways of characterizing the nature and causes of virulence (and pathogenicity), and both lead to the development of different measures to prevent or to treat emerging infectious diseases. While ecological approaches contribute to the establishment of national and international programmes intended to increase detection and surveillance in emerging infections on a global scale, monitoring changes in virulence to prevent pandemics worldwide, molecular approaches facilitate the development of biomedical tools, such as vaccines or antibiotics, to fight infectious diseases either by reducing their pathogenic power, and/or by enhancing individual and group (or herd) immunity. Yet both perspectives can also work together: molecular phylogenies can provide evidence regarding the likely origins of future pandemics and help to channel the attention of a detection network onto particularly sensitive sites (see Morens et al. 2012). A better integration of ecological and molecular approaches would thus benefit public health medicine by providing stronger theoretical approaches and empirical mechanistic models to understand, manage and perhaps even predict future influenza pandemics.",
