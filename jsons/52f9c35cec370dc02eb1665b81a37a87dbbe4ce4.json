Early in 2008, U.S. and Canadian versions of this in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device received regulatory clearances from the FDA and Health Canada, respectively. The CE-IVD kit provides the most comprehensive viral coverage in the xTAG RVP IVD product line through its ability to simultaneously detect the following viruses: The test provides a unique result for 18 of the 20 viruses listed above. A single result is provided for the closely related members of the picornaviridae family, enterovirus and rhinovirus, due to the high degree of nucleic acid sequence homology across different strains of these viruses. In addition to detecting the aforementioned viruses in a single reaction well, there are two unique results generated for controls detected in the same multiplex reaction. The first (Escherichia coli phage MS2) is an internal control that is added to each patient sample. This internal control monitors all steps in the assay: (1) nucleic acid extraction; (2) RT; (3) multiplex PCR; (4) multiplex target specific primer extension (TSPE); (5) Universal Array sorting; and (6) xMAP detection. The second (bacteriophage lambda) is as- sayed in a separate well and controls for a subset of these steps (PCR, TSPE, sorting, and detection). By assessing results for these two controls together with results for targeted analytes, the end-user is able to ascertain whether assay failures are due to a failure in the nucleic acid extraction/RT step or in the subsequent assay steps (PCR/TSPE/sorting/detection). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the CE-IVD kit was established through an evaluation of 1,464 prospectively and retrospectively collected clinical samples. The demographic features of this study cohort are summarized in Table 1 . It is worthwhile to note that several of these patients presented with a variety of coinfections that were detected by xTAG RVP but that would otherwise be missed by traditional methods. Of these 1,464 patient samples, 544 were prospectively collected nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs used to establish clinical performance characteristics for the U.S. version of the kit ( Table 2) . A second-generation IVD (xTAG RVP FAST) was introduced in Europe and Canada late in 2009. This line extension has a streamlined workflow, shorter time to result, and modified analyte coverage when compared to xTAG RVP. In addition to performance validations required for regulatory applications, there have been numerous third-party validations of the xTAG RVP product line. Several of these have involved comparisons to real-time applications and support the conclusion of improved diagnostic coverage and cost-efficiency being afforded through xTAG/xMAP detection. 19, 23, 24 The introduction of respiratory viral panels built on xTAG/xMAP technologies has served as a catalyst for NAAT adoption in diagnostic algorithms. In the United States, the January 3, 2008 clearance of xTAG RVP by the FDA represented the first clearance of a respiratory viral panel utilizing nucleic acid-based detection. 25 This device was also the first to receive FDA clearance for a recently discovered respiratory virus (hMPV) and for Flu A subtyping. 25 The ability to specifically identify seasonal subtypes of influenza A proved to be an invaluable tool during the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic that ensued the following year.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2832, "end": 2835, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2836, "end": 2839, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2840, "end": 2842, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3165, "end": 3167, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3300, "end": 3302, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1877, "end": 1884, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2254, "end": 2262, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Introduction of xTAG RVP into diagnostic algorithms"}, {"text": "Of the three known types of influenza (influenza A, B, and C), only influenza A viruses are further classified by subtypes based on two main surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (http:// www. cdc. gov/flu/avian/gen-info/flu-viruses.htm). Observations to date suggest that influenza A and B continuously evolve through antigenic drift, while only influenza A evolves through antigenic shift (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/fluviruses.htm). Antigenic drift is a gradual process of change via point mutations that lead to novel strains of viruses. It explains why people and animals can be infected by the same virus type (e.g., influenza B) more than once. Namely, the host response to an infecting strain may not grant immunity to new strains that have emerged through antigenic drift (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/fluviruses.htm). Antigenic shift, on the other hand, is a more dramatic process resulting from genetic reassortment, which occurs when influenza viruses exchange genetic material. This abrupt process can occur when two or more influenza A viruses infect a single human or animal host (http://www. cdc.gov/h1n1flu/information h1n1 virus qa.htm). Antigenic shift can lead to a global influenza pandemic if three conditions are met: (1) a new influenza A subtype is introduced into the human population, (2) the virus causes serious illness in humans, and (3) the virus can easily spread from person to person in a sustainable manner (http://www. cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/flu-viruses.htm).
