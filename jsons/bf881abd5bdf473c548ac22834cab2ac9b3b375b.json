The aims of this study were to identify GAS isolates and to determine emm typing, the coverage rate of available vaccines, and the distribution of superantigen gene profiles. 15 GAS isolates were isolated from throat cultures of 200 patients with tonsillopharyngitis, who were admitted to Canakkale Health Application and Research Hospital between October 2017 and May 2018. Identification of the isolates was performed by conventional methods and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. emm typing and exotoxin profiling of the isolates were performed by polymerase chain reaction. 7.5% GAS was detected in 200 patients. All the GAS isolates were identified as S. pyogenes. emm typing can be carried out in 13 S. pyogenes isolates. emm89 (33.3%), emm44 (20%), emm6 (13.3%), emm84 (6.7%), emm1 (6.7%), and emm18.1 (6.7%) were found to be six emm types. The coverage rate of S. pyogenes strains for 26-valent vaccine was 61.5% and for the 30-valent vaccine 84.6%. The most common exotoxin was speB (86.7%), followed by speC (60%), speF (33.3%), ssa (26.7%), speA (20%), speM (20%), speJ (13.3%), speL (6.7%), and speI (6.7%). As a result of determining the emm types of S. pyogenes species in Canakkale, it was concluded that the potential of 30-valent vaccine should be considered in Turkey and development of vaccines containing exotoxin types may be beneficial.",

            "text": "Many serious virulence factors play a role in the pathogenicity of S. pyogenes. The most notable factor is surface M protein encoded by the emm gene, showing its effect by facilitating adhesion, providing resistance to opsonophagocytosis and contributing to the overall burden of GAS infections [4, 5] . To date, more than 200 emm types and subtypes have been reported. The hyper-variable region of the emm gene forms the basis for emm typing in GAS. M protein is used as an epidemiological marker because of the different emm-type distribution in variable regions [6, 7] . emm gene sequence analysis is a useful tool to understand local transmission dynamics and geographical distribution of the emm types. Knowing the emm-type distribution of different patient populations in different regions of the same country can be used to understand local epidemiology and to determine local vaccine formulation. M protein, which is exhibited by all the strains of S. pyogenes, can be immunized in the host and is used in valuable vaccine development studies. Vaccines with 26-valves and 30-valves include streptococcal Mehzat Altun and Binnur Mericli Yap\u0131c\u0131 have contributed equally to this work. emm types that cause non-invasive (tonsillopharyngitis) and invasive infections [8, 9] . Superantigens (SAgs), containing mitogenic exotoxins, are produced by a small number of bacterial species and some viruses [10, 11] . GAS secretes several SAgs, e.g., streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (spe), streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin (smeZ), and streptococcal superantigen (ssa). These toxins are extracellular products and exhibit antigenic properties. SAgs, whose gene distribution and genomic heterogeneity have been determined, can be used as an additional epidemiological tool for further investigations of toxin-dependent diseases [12, 13] .",

Molecular epidemiology studies report that there are significant differences in emm-type distribution at global level, especially between high-income countries and resource-poor countries and tropical regions. Although a small number of emm types are observed in developed countries, a wide variety of emm types are more common in disease-related strains in low-income countries. Previous studies have reported that socioeconomic factors have a considerable influence on the diversity of emm types and circulation of S. pyogenes [23] .",
