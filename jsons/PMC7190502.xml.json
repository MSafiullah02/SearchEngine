Under certain conditions, the increase in the duration of wearing a mask or their re-use may be authorized [11]. They should normally not be re-used but they are also in short supply in some areas. In this situation the manufacturer should be contacted for advice on whether it is possible to disinfect or reprocess the face mask. Coronaviruses are inactivated at 60\u00b0C in 30 min so that thermal disinfection may be an option [12]. The construction of the face mask may allow thermal disinfection [13]. But some masks may lose their filtration capacity or the fitting in the face resulting in less protection for the user [13]. That is why it is so important to have a statement from the manufacturer. The WHO indicates that reprocessing masks or respirators should only be considered when there is critical shortage or lack of them [2]. Any type of reprocessing should ensure that the efficacy of the process is ensured, the reprocessing method does not result in residual toxicity for the healthcare workers and the functional integrity and shape of the item is maintained [2]. The following options are available:\u2022The mask may be disinfected or sterilized\noOrganize re-use of face masks (ideally person-bound) and thermal disinfection or steam sterilization [14]\noMark the mask (number of disinfections or sterilisations)\noEvaluate any visible damage of the mask when disinfected or sterilized more often\n\u2022No information\noTry to find information from other manufacturers with similar face masks\n\u2022The mask should not be disinfected or sterilized\noFFP2 mask: Keep the same mask for up to 8 h maximum [11]\noSurgical face mask: keep the same mask for up to 4 h (SFHH ) or 6 h (WHO) maximum [2, 11]\noTry to find another supplier or accept the risk of a potentially insufficient protection\noThe use of face shields may be an alternative [2]\n\u2022The masks should be worn as long as possible [15].\n",

Their use is indicated in various clinical situations, e.g. when contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, or non-intact skin is anticipated [4]. The reuse of gloves is not recommended by the WHO but in the case of glove reuse, the safest reprocessing method should be implemented [4].
