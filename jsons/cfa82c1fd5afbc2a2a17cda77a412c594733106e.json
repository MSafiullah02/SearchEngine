Granulocytopenia is defined as a neutrophil count less than 500 cells/mm 3 or less than 1,000 cells/mm 3 with expected decrease to less than 500 cells/mm 3 within 48 hours, and it is the main immune defect of cancer patients following chemotherapy. 4 The inverse relationship between the magnitude of granulocytopenia and subsequent infection was first delineated in the 1960s by Bodey et al., in patients with acute leukemia 5 : the incidence of infection was 14% if the absolute granulocyte count fell below 500 to 1,000/mm 3 and 24% to 60% if it fell below 100/mm 3 (Figure 76 .1). 5 Prolonged granulocytopenia, especially a rapid decline in circulating granulocytes, also increases the risk of deep fungal infection. 5 Absolute granulocyte counts less than 500 cells/mm 3 for more than 10 days is now viewed as the threshold for a greatly increased risk of severe infection. 6 Common pathogens causing infection in granulocytopenia include a wide array of gramnegative and gram-positive bacteria, Candida species, and filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus and Fusarium. 1 In general, with the exception of lymphoproliferative malignancies, defects of humoral immunity are not seen in most patients with cancer. However, globulin dysfunction or depletion is common in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and nearly universal in multiple myeloma, predisposing to invasive infection with encapsulated organisms, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. 7 Impairment of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) occurs with selected chemotherapeutic agents, such as the purine analogues, 8 and has also been described with novel therapies for cancer, such as monoclonal antibodies. Pathogens typically associated with impaired CMI include Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii), the herpesviruses, especially cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and atypical mycobacteria, Candida, and Nocardia.",

This class of drugs produces profound lymphocytopenia and a marked decrease in CD4 cells that can persist for several years following the discontinuation of treatment, which, in the case of fludarabine, has been associated with a high incidence of severe opportunistic infections, as high as 50% in some series, most occurring during the first 6 weeks of therapy. 8 Early reports on the spectrum of infections associated with purine analogues emphasized, in addition to the usual bacterial pathogens causing infection in granulocytopenic patients, an increased incidence of infections caused by pathogens associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity (CMI), particularly Listeria monocytogenes and Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii), occurring most often in patients who were heavily pretreated with alkylating agents and may also have received concomitant corticosteroids.

A recent large retrospective cohort study of P. aeruginosa bacteremia in a cancer hospital, found that the incidence of BSI fell from 4.7 to 2.1 per 1,000 admissions in 1991 to 1995; however, no decline was noted in patients with acute leukemia, and P. aeruginosa accounted for 15% to 20% of gram-negative infections in leukemic patients. 26 Pseudomonas aeruginosa rarely causes serious infection in the normal host but is capable of causing devastating, invasive disease if host defenses are breached by mucositis or myelosuppression from chemotherapy or the underlying malignancy, IVDs, or other invasive devices. However, the most important risk factor for life-threatening P. aeruginosa infection in patients with cancer is granulocytopenia. 26, 27 Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes a wide spectrum of infections in the granulocytopenic patient. Pneumonia and bacteremia are most common, but involvement of the urinary tract and skin also occurs. Skin lesions are present in approximately 20% of cancer patients with bacteremia. Ecthyma grangrenosum, the classic skin lesion historically associated with P. aeruginosa in patients with granulocytopenia, occurs most commonly in the axilla, groin, and perianal region 28 (Figure 76 .3). Histologically, these lesions show a septic vasculitis with dense bacillary infiltration of the blood vessel walls. P. aeruginosa septicemia may also be associated with subcutaneous nodules, deep abscesses, cellulitis, vesicular or pustular lesions, bullae, or necrotizing fasciitis. 29 In general, treatment of P. aeruginosa sepsis represents a formidable challenge, because of the intrinsic resistance of the organism to most antimicrobials, and the capacity to rapidly develop resistance during therapy. Factors associated with an unfavorable outcome include persistent neutropenia, especially an absolute granulocyte count of less than 100 cells/mm 3 , septic shock, lung, skin, or soft tissue involvement, or unidentified source, renal failure, metastatic foci, rapidly or ultimately fatal underlying disease, and inappropriate antibiotic therapy. 26, 27, 30 Most studies have found a higher mortality rate among patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia compared with other bacteremias. 26, 27 It is not clear to what extent a higher mortality rate reflects the more severe underlying illnesses affecting patients susceptible to",

The specific choice of agents should be guided by institutional antibiotic susceptibility patterns and guidelines. Although the subject of intense debate, cohort studies and a recent meta-analysis suggest that, in patients with P. aeruginosa sepsis, there is a survival advantage with combination therapy as contrasted with treatment with one antimicrobial to which the infecting strain is susceptible. 31 ",

Their increased frequency almost certainly derives from the very heavy use of cephalosporins over the past 25 years, drugs to which all enterococci are intrinsically resistant. The most common infections caused by enterococci are bacteremias, urinary tract infections, and postoperative surgical site infections; endocarditis is seen only rarely in patients being treated for cancer. 48 Enterococcus faecalis is the predominant species, accounting for 75% to 80% of enterococcal infections; however, infections caused by Enterococcus faecium are rapidly rising. This finding is of great concern, because 25% of all enterococcal isolates in U.S. hospitals are now resistant to vancomycin, and most of the vancomycin-resistant strains are E. faecium. 49 In the setting of granulocytopenia, bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) has been associated with mortality greater than 70%. 50 ",

In 20% to 30% of patients with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia, there is radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and it is usually assumed to be caused by the same organisms causing bacteremia; this is not necessarily the case, particularly with bacteremia caused by bacteria, such as enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Bacillus species, or Corynebacterium jeikium, which rarely cause pneumonia. Conventional chest radiographs show pulmonary infiltrates in less than 10% of patients who remain febrile despite antibacterial therapy, whereas CT, particularly the use of high-resolution scans, shows lung infiltrates in 50% of these patients. 62 Microbiologic diagnosis is based on blood cultures and cultures of specimens obtained by bronchoscopy or bronchoalveolar lavage. However, the role of invasive diagnostic procedures in granulocytopenic patients remains controversial; moreover, many bronchoscopists are reluctant to perform bronchoscopy, especially transbronchial biopsy, in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. During the past decade, molecular diagnostic methods have become available for the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae, Aspergillus, and Legionella. 63 However, the predictive value of these tests in patients with granulocytopenia and pneumonia has not been adequately characterized at this time.",

Patients who are clinically stable and have a small infiltrate may be observed for 48 hours. If the chest radiograph is suggestive of fluid overload, a trial of diuretics may be given, but continued observation of diffuse infiltrates is not recommended, as rapid clinical deterioration tends to occur when the problem is diffuse pneumonitis. 64 If rapid clinical improvement does not ensue, and the infiltrate has not changed, the patient may continue to be observed on therapy, and follow-up pulmonary imaging should be considered. If the infiltrate progresses on antimicrobial therapy, more aggressive diagnostic procedures are strongly recommended, preferably fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). 64 In many centers, if no improvement is noted after 5 to 7 days of antibiotics, empiric therapy with amphotericin B is started.

[69] [70] [71] The majority of these patients receive antimicrobial therapy; mucositis and surgical procedures also increase risk. 23 Studies have also implicated chemotherapeutic agents as independent risk factors for C. difficile-associated diarrhea, even in the absence of antibiotic therapy, presumably because of alteration of the normal bowel flora and extensive mucosal inflammation caused by chemotherapy, facilitating colonization by C. difficile. 71 A recent case-control study in hematology and oncology patients showed that antineoplastic therapy was associated with a fivefold-greater risk of developing C. difficile colitis [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5.1; P = 0.01]. 72 Clostridium difficile infection encompasses a spectrum of conditions ranging from asymptomatic colonization to fulminant disease with toxic megacolon. 73 The usual presentation is acute watery diarrhea with lower abdominal pain and fever occurring during or shortly after beginning antimicrobial therapy. The antibiotics that most predispose to C. difficile infection are third-or fourth-generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, and penicillins 74 ; however, virtually any antimicrobial may trigger C. difficile infection.",

This test, although 94% to 100% sensitive and 99% specific, takes at least 48 to 72 hours before results are available. In severely ill patients, flexible sigmoidoscopy provides a rapid means of diagnosis, because 90% of cases of pseudomembranous colitis involve the left side of the colon; the visualization of colonic pseudomembranes is essentially pathognomonic for C. difficile infection (Figure 76 .4). CT of the abdomen, although useful for identifying bowel wall thickness, does not differentiate between C. difficile and other causes of bowel wall thickening, such as ischemic colitis. 76 The most important step in the treatment of C. difficile is discontinuation of the culpable antimicrobial, if possible; in approximately 25% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, this will prove sufficient to resolve the infection. However, discontinuation may not always be possible in a profoundly granulocytopenic patient who is infected or febrile.

Hand hygiene with an antiseptic agent is essential. It is important to note that alcohol-based handrubs do not have activity against the spore form of C. difficile.

            "text": "How long to treat IVDR BSI will be influenced by the infecting microorganism, and by whether the patient has underlying valvular heart disease, already has evidence of endocarditis or septic thrombosis, or shows evidence of metastatic infection. If endocarditis is suspected, transesophageal echocardiography offers superior sensitivity and discrimination for detecting vegetations, as compared with transthoracic echocardiography. 101 In patients with high-grade bacteremia or fungemia, but without clinical or echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis, septic thrombosis should be suspected. 97 Central venous thrombosis can now be diagnosed by venography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or CT. 111 Although there are no prospective studies to guide the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for IVDR BSIs, most coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections can be cured with 5 to 7 days of therapy, 112, 113 whereas most infections caused by other microorganisms are adequately treated with 10 to 14 days of antimicrobial therapy. 113 These recommendations hold only as long as there are no complications related to the infection and the BSI clears within 72 hours of initiating therapy. Nosocomial enterococcal bacteremia deriving from an IVD is rarely associated with persistent endovascular infection, and unless there is clinical or echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis, treatment with IV ampicillin or vancomycin alone for 7 to 14 days should suffice. 48 The management of S. aureus device-related infection deserves special mention, as there have been no prospective studies to evaluate the optimal duration of therapy for IVDR BSIs caused by this ubiquitous human pathogen. Historically, high rates of associated IE and late complications led to a universal policy of 4 to 6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy for all patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Earlier diagnosis and initiation of bactericidal therapy of nosocomial S. aureus BSIs in recent years have been associated with lower rates of IE and metastatic complications, prompting suggestions that short-course therapy (i.e., 14 days) is effective and safe for most patients with S. aureus IVDR BSI, so long as the patient defervesces within 72 hours and there is no evidence of metastatic infection. 114 In a study of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in 103 hospitalized patients with S. aureus bacteremia, 69 related to an IVD, Fowler et al. found a surprisingly high incidence of endocarditis, 23% with IVDR S. aureus BSI. 101 In a more recent report, these authors have reported that the routine use of TEE with IVDR S. aureus BSI, as a means to stratify patients into short-course or longcourse therapy, is cost-effective. 115 However, at this time, there are no prospective studies to affirm this approach. Until more data are available, short-course therapy for IVDR S. aureus bacteremia therapy should be approached with caution, and used only when the TEE is unequivocally negative and the patient has defervesced within 72 hours of removing the IVD and starting antiinfective therapy.",

Seven randomized, prospective trials have examined a vancomycincontaining antibiotic lock solution for the prevention of IVDR BSI, 117 the largest of which found that use of a vancomycin or vancomycin/ciprofloxacin lock solution reduced the risk of IVDR BSI nearly 80% (P equal to or less than 0.005). 118 Concern about the emergence of resistance with prophylactic antibiotic-containing lock solutions has limited their acceptance to date. Three of the seven studies performed serial surveillance cultures for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus; VRE was not found in any of these studies. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotic lock solution is considered acceptable in the HICPAC Guideline if a patient with an essential long-term IVD has continued to experience recurrent IVDR BSIs despite consistent application of recommended infection control practices. 116 ",

Cutaneous dissemination can follow a dermatomal eruption in up to 35% of cancer patients, in contrast to only 4% in persons without cancer. Involvement of adjacent dermatomes is not unusual in immunocompetent patients and does not usually represent disseminated disease. Viral culture of lesions fails to detect the virus in 40% to 70% of cases. 130 Fluorescent antibody staining appears to be easier and far more sensitive diagnos-tically. Amplification of VZV DNA is of limited value in the diagnosis of cutaneous disease, but PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage and cerebrospinal fluid can be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of VZV pneumonia or meningoencephalitis. 131, 132 Treatment of immunodeficient patients with varicella or herpes zoster is described in Table 76 .9. Intravenous acyclovir, 10 mg/kg every 8 hours, is recommended for most patients; however, oral therapy with valaciclovir or famciclovir may be used in patients with mild to moderate immunosuppression who do not have evidence of disseminated or visceral disease. Resistance to acyclovir, mediated by mutation of the viral thymidine kinase, has been seen almost exclusively in patients with AIDS, but should be suspected in any patient not responding to therapy, in which case the use of foscarnet or cidofovir is recommended (see Table 76 .9). 123 The median time to onset of herpes zoster in BMT patients is 5 months 123 ; as a result, preventive therapy with acyclovir or its congeners is not recommended. The use of varicella zoster-immunoglobulin (VZIG) can reduce the risk of primary infection and its attendant complications, but must be given to susceptible immunodeficient individuals within 96 hours of exposure at a dose of 125 U/10 kg (maximum dose, 625 U). 133 The use of live, attenuated varicella virus vaccine is contraindicated in immunocompromised adults at the present time, although a clinical trial of the vaccine is under way in susceptible children. 133 Household contacts of immunodeficient patients at risk should be vaccinated if they are known to be susceptible to varicella infection (i.e., children and adults with no known history of varicella). 134 CYTOMEGALOVIRUS Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpesvirus that may infect up to 50% to 70% of the population in developed countries. 123 Cytomegalovirus infection is seen mainly in patients undergoing BMT or solid organ transplantation, 135 patients with leukemia, as a result of exposure to powerful immunosuppressive drugs, such as fludarabine and cytoxan. 137 Seropositive patients undergoing BMT or those who receive marrow from a seropositive donor without preventive therapy, develop infection in 60% to 70% of cases. 123 The likelihood of CMV infection is greatly increased in patients who develop graft-versus-host disease, those who receive an HLA-mismatched transplant, or those who receive antithymocyte immunoglobulin. 138, 139 Clinically, CMV infection in immunosuppressed patients can range from asymptomatic excretion to fulminant disseminated disease. Cytomegalovirus viremia often presents as unexplained fever without specific end-organ involvement but usually manifests as pneumonia or gastroenteritis. Without therapy, CMV pneumonia is fatal in up to 85% of cases. 139 Less common manifestations include esophagitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, encephalitis, and retinitis.",

            "text": "Community-acquired viral respiratory pathogens (Table  76 .10) are increasingly recognized causes of infection in immunocompromised patients. In one study at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, a respiratory virus was isolated from 33% of adult patients presenting with a respiratory illness, 31% caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 28% by rhinoviruses or picornaviruses, 18% by influenza A or B, and 23% by parainfluenza or adenoviruses. 153 Parainfluenza, rhinoviruses, and andenovirus infections occur year round, whereas infections caused by influenza A and B and RSV peak during the winter months. Although many respiratory viral infections are community acquired, several studies have clearly demonstrated the potential for nosocomial acquisi- 154, 155 Mortality associated with these infections is difficult to establish, because many patients infected by these viruses die with, rather than of, their viral infection. Nevertheless, studies examining mortality in immunocompromised patients from whom a viral respiratory pathogen has been isolated have found case-fatality rates ranging from 22% to 44%. 153 Mortality appears to be higher for patients infected with RSV; Whimby et al. found that 60% of leukemic patients who developed RSV died of complications related to their infection. 156 Diagnostic tests for most of the major respiratory viral pathogens, such as influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, RSV, and adenovirus, are commercially available. A description of individual tests is beyond the scope of this text; however, a new rapid reverse transcriptase PCR test (Hexaplex; Prodesse, Waukesha, WI), which simultaneously tests for the presence of both influenza subtypes, the three parainfluenza subtypes, and the two RSV subtypes, has shown high diagnostic accuracy. 157 The treatment of most respiratory viral infections is supportive; however, there are viable treatment options for influenza and RSV. 158 The neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir, is active against both influenza A and B, whereas amantidine and rimantidine possess activity only against influenza A; therapeutic impact appears to be negligible if the antiviral agent cannot be started within 48 to 72 hours of onset of clinical symptoms. 158 Aerosolized ribavirin has traditionally been used in patients with RSV; however, its benefit appears to be marginal in patients with established infection. The concomitant use of RSV immunoglobulin with aerosolized ribavirin has been shown to reduce mortality in leukemic adults by 30% compared to historical controls (70% to 50%). 155 The results from an ongoing randomized trial of aerosolized ribavirin versus ribavirin plus RSV immunoglobulin are still unavailable. The use of intravenous ribavirin does not appear to be of clinical benefit and can be associated with hemolysis, limiting its utility in this population. 159 The prevention of nosocomial transmission of communityacquired respiratory viral infections, such as influenza and RSV deserves mention, given the number of reports of institutional outbreaks. 160, 161 Minimum infection control practices to prevent nosocomial respiratory viral infections include (1) timely immunization of patients and staff against influenza 162 ; (2) prevention of patient contact with persons (friends, family, and healthcare staff) who have active respiratory symptoms; (3) use of rapid diagnostic tests to quickly identify symptomatic patients with potentially transmissible viral pathogens; (4) grouping patients with confirmed infection when single rooms are not available; and (5) placement of patients with suspected community-acquired respiratory viral infections in droplet isolation precautions. The use of more aggressive isolation procedures, such as contact and airborne isolation precautions, with or without the use of prophylactic antiviral agents, may require consideration with outbreaks among very high risk patients.",

Contrast radiographic studies are nonspecific and may be negative in up to 25% of cases; therefore, the diagnosis of candida esophagitis rests on detection of characteristic pseudomembranes and ulcerations by endoscopy. Examination of biopsy specimens, if obtained, confirms the diagnosis. Topical therapy with nonabsorbable antifungals is ineffective in patients with esophagitis, and systemic therapy with fluconazole, caspofungin, or IV amphotericin B is mandatory. The latter two agents are preferred in institutions with high rates of infections caused by non-albicans species or in patients with candida esophagitis who have received azoles in the past. Candida spp. are also an increasingly common cause of nosocomial BSI, 166 associated with case-fatality rates ranging from 30% to 60%. 167, 168 Disseminated infection usually occurs as a complication of candidemia and may be associated with cutaneous lesions, retinitis or endophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, and even endocarditis. Most episodes of candidemia in nongranulocytopenic patients originate from IVDs. 169 However, controversy exists over the relative role of IVDs versus intestinal translocation in patients with granulocytopenia or who have received intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy. 170 Studies performed two decades ago found that blood cultures are negative in more than 50% of patients with disseminated Candida infections confirmed at autopsy. 171 In contrast, recent studies have found that automated blood culturing systems detect up to 93% of cases of active candidemia. 172 Recovery of Candida spp. from a blood culture should never be regarded as a contaminant in decisions regarding treatment. Controversies about the source of candidemia aside, a considerable body of literature suggests that retention of an IVD is associated with prolonged candidemia and excess mortality. [102] [103] [104] As a result, we believe that IVDs should be removed from most patients with proven candidemia. Candidemia that responds rapidly to removal of the device and institution of IV amphotericin B can be reliably treated with a daily dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg and a total dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg. 173 If a lipid-associated formulation of amphotericin B is being used, a daily dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg and a total dose of 10 to 20 mg/kg should be sufficient in most cases. 104 If the patient has septic thrombosis of the central vein, associated with high-grade candidemia and florid sepsis, or infection caused by non-albicans species, a higher dose of IV amphotericin B is recommended, 0.7 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg or more total conventional amphotericin, 2 to 3 mg/kg/day and 20 to 30 mg/kg total, for a lipid-associated formulation. 173 Fluconazole (400 mg/day) has been shown to be as effective as IV amphotericin B in randomized trials in nongranulocytopenic patients, 174, 175 and has further been shown to be comparable to amphotericin B in observational studies of granulocytopenic patients with Candida IVDR BSIs, 104 but should not be used in IVDR BSIs associated with septic thrombosis and high-grade candidemia or in BSIs caused by azole-resistant species.",

Intravenous caspofungin, which has a low incidence of side effects and can be given once daily, can now be considered a first-line drug for initial treatment of deep invasive candidal infection in centers with high rates of infection caused by non-albicans species, pending identification and susceptibility of the bloodstream isolate.",

            "text": "Aspergillus spp. are ubiquitous environmental organisms, encountered most often in rural areas but also found throughout most hospitals. Invasive infections caused by Aspergillus spp. are an increasing problem in many hematology and solid organ transplant centers, with incidence rates of 5% to 24% among patients with acute leukemia. 178 Invasive aspergillosis is most often a complication of severe and prolonged granulocytopenia, and the duration of granulocytopenia is the most powerful predictor of risk of invasive aspergillosis. The median time to onset of disease in patients with severe granulocytopenia is 17 days and, historically, the majority of cases occur within 90 days in patients undergoing BMT, 163 although recent studies have found an increasing number of patients with invasive aspergillus that developed in 90 days or more. 179, 180 Other risk factors associated with invasive aspergillosis include receipt of OKT3 antibodies, active CMV disease, and renal failure. 163 The most commonly isolated species have been Aspergillus fumigatus (more than 90% of all proven infections), Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus. Aspergillus can infect any organ, but sinopulmonary disease is the most common manifestation. Infections often present insidiously in patients with granulocytopenia and fever may be the only manifestation. Dull chest pain that may become pleuritic in nature, cough, and sinus congestion are also common. Hemoptysis, although suspicious for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, is relatively uncommon. Up to half of patients with lung involvement have disseminated disease that can involve the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, liver, or skin. 163 Less common presentations include isolated skin lesions, often at sites of vascular catheter insertions 181 or isolated gastrointestinal involvement, 163 possibly the result of ingestion of water containing these organisms. 182 Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, mortality in patients with invasive aspergillosis remains high, 90% in BMT patients and nearly 80% in patients with leukemia. 183 The diagnosis of invasive Aspergillus infection remains a formidable challenge. Chest radiographs are completely normal in 10% of patients with documented infection. 184 Chest CT is read as normal in only 3% of cases, and up to 85% of infected patients have characteristic radiographic findings, such as a \"halo\" 185 or \"crescent\" 186 sign. Aspergillus species are rarely isolated from expectorated sputum, and cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid are positive in only 20% of cases in most series; however, a positive culture for Aspergillus fumigatus has a very high positive predictive value for invasive disease in high-risk patients, in excess of 75%. 187 Transbronchial biopsy increases the diagnostic yield to 75%. 184 Molecular diagnostic tests that detect the presence of circulating galactomannan, a fungal cell wall constituent, and PCR techniques to detect ribosomal genetic material conserved across Aspergillus species, may eventually abrogate the need for invasive tests. 163 The sequential use of an ELISA to detect galactomannan was found to have an 87.5% positive predictive value and a 98.4% negative predictive value in a recent prospective trial in neutropenic BMT patients. 188 The treatment of invasive aspergillosis has also undergone evolution. Traditional therapy has relied upon IV amphotericin B deoxycholate in doses of 1 to 1.5 mg/kg/day (Table  76 .12); however, at these doses, nephrotoxicity is ubiquitous. 189 Itraconazole also possesses activity against Aspergillus spp. and appeared to be equivalent to amphotericin B deoxycholate in a retrospective analysis 190 ; however, bias toward treatment of less severely ill patients limits the generalizability of this report, and we do not believe that clinicians should rely upon itraconazole alone for the treatment of invasive aspergillus infections at this time. 190 On the other hand, the newly released triazole, voriconazole, was recently shown to be superior, in terms of fewer side effects and improved clinical response (53% versus 32%) and patient survival (71% versus 58%), compared to amphotericin B deoxycholate in a large multicenter randomized trial. 191 As a result, voriconazole is now widely considered the standard of therapy for patients with documented Aspergillus infections. The use of antifungal drug combinations for treatment of invasive aspergillosis is currently under investigation, with caspofungin combined with lipid-based amphotericin B or voriconazole showing the most promise. 192, 193 Zygomycetes Zycomycosis, known more commonly as mucormycosis, is a devastating infection caused by a variety of filamentous fungi in the order Mucorales. Risk factors for mucormycosis include diabetic ketoacidosis, iron overload, and, increasingly, prolonged granulocytopenia. 194 Rhinocerebral disease is the most common presentation in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis; however, pulmonary involvement, very similar to that seen with invasive aspergillosis, appears to be the most common manifestation of Mucorales infection in patients with cancer. 194 A black eschar may be seen on the nasal mucosa or soft palate in rhinocerebral disease, or on the skin in disseminated disease ( Figure 76.9 ), or at sites of intravascular catheter insertion. 195 Involvement of the central nervous system can occur either as a result of direct extension from the sinuses, with rhinocerebral disease, or hematogenously, in disseminated disease. Diagnosis of Mucorales infection rests on histopathologic examination or culture of a biopsy specimen, as blood and respiratory tract specimens are almost always culture negative, and the radiographic presentation may not be distinguishable from that seen with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. It is important to recognize that the newer antifungals, voriconazole and caspofungin, have no activity against zygomycetes. Treatment begins with aggressive debridement whenever possible, combined with the use of conventional (1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) or lipid-based amphotericin B (5 to 7.5 mg/kg/day). Despite treatment, mortality is greater than 75% in cancer patients. 163 FUSARIUM Fusarium species are soil saprophytes that have been increasingly implicated as a cause of fatal infection in patients with cancer, primarily patients with acute leukemia or those undergoing BMT. 196 Colonization originating from contaminated hospital water systems has been described, 197 although the significance of this finding has been challenged. 198 Fusariosis may be acquired either as a result of inhalation, with the development of pulmonary disease indistinguishable from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, or from direct inoculation through the skin or an IVD access site. In all settings, hematogenous dissemination with widespread cutaneous involvement is common, and blood cultures are positive in up to 50% of patients with documented systemic fusariosis. 163 Recovery from granulocytopenia is critical to patient survival: a recent study found that all patients who had refractory granulocytopenia died of fusarium infection. 199 Fluconazole and itraconazole are inactive against Fusarium species, and amphotericin B (1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) is still considered the first line of therapy. Voriconazole possesses activity against Fusarium species in vitro, and its clinical use was associated with a complete or partial response in 43% of patients in a recent small trial. 194 Granulocyte infusions may have an important adjunctive role in infected patients with refractory granulocytopenia. 199 Other Fungal Infections A variety of unusual fungal organisms has been increasingly reported in infected patients with cancer. 163 Infections caused by these rare organisms have recently been reviewed by Walsh and Groll. 200 Table 76 .13 lists some of the more prevalent emerging fungal pathogens and possible therapeutic options, although it is important to note that the outcome with most of these infections has been poor, and reported successes with treatment modalities have been anecdotal.",

Two recent meta-analyses encompassing more than 4,000 patients, found that patients with uncomplicated granulocytopenic fever treated with a beta-lactam alone, as contrasted with a beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside found no significant difference in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.85-0.87; P = 0.057). 203, 204 Although rates of superinfection in both groups were similar, the frequency of adverse events was higher in patients receiving combination therapy. Another meta-analysis, using clinical failure of antimicrobial therapy as the outcome measure, also found beta-lactam monotherapy to be comparable to aminoglycoside-containing combinations in uncomplicated granulocytopenic fever. 205 The antimicrobial agents that have been best studied for monotherapy include a third-generation (ceftazidime) or fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime) or a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem). The emergence of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBL) in Enterobacteriaceae has reduced the utility of ceftazidime for monotherapy. 206 Imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and cefepime, unlike ceftazidime, are active against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and also have excellent activity against viridans streptococci and pneumococci. A prospective double-blind study of 411 patients with cancer showed that the rate of clinical response was higher in febrile granulocytopenic patients treated with meropenem than it was in those treated with ceftazidime. 207 It is important to recognize that the spectrum of any of these drugs does not usually encompass coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and some strains of multiresistant Streptococcus pneumoniae or viridans streptococci. Therefore, close monitoring of the clinical response to treatment is important, and antiinfective therapy may need to be adapted to institutional susceptibilities, and modified, based on the susceptibilities of the organisms recovered in culture.",

Comparative trials have found that inclusion of vancomycin in the initial regimen does reduce the frequency of secondary nosocomial BSIs with these organisms during therapy 211 ; however, these studies have not shown reduced morbidity and mortality. A recent prospective trial randomized 165 granulocytopenic patients with persistent fever despite piperacillin/tazobactam to the addition of vancomycin or placebo; no statistically significant differences were noted regarding time to defervescence or additional episodes of gram-positive bacteremia. 212 In general, heavy use of vancomycin in the absence of a clear clinical indication is undesirable because of the risk of promoting vancomycin resistance in enterococci or S. aureus. Thus, routine use of vancomycin in the initial antimicrobial regimen for the febrile granulocytopenic patient is not recommended unless (1) the hospital has a high rate of nosocomial infection with MRSA or the patient is known to have previously been colonized or infected by MRSA, (2) there are reasons to suspect overwhelming alpha-hemolytic viridans streptococcal bacteremia, that is, shock with respiratory distress, (3) the patient shows evidence of infection at the exit site or tunnel of a CVC, or (4) the patient is at risk for endocarditis, that is, has a prosthetic heart valve. 213 For microbiologically confirmed infections with coagulase-negative staphylococci or other resistant gram-positive organisms, vancomycin should be added to the initial regimen. Linezolid, the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oxazolidinone, offers promise for treatment of resistant gram-positive bacterial infections, including those caused by VRE, although reversible drug-related myelosuppression can be seen, mainly with prolonged courses. Quinupristin-dalfopristin, another drug that has recently been approved by the FDA, is also effective against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (but not E. fecalis) and other gram-positive bacteria. 214 However, further studies are needed 1 3 8 4 c h a p t e r 7 6 before recommendations can be made for the use of these drugs in initial empiric regimens in patients with cancer.",

Oral therapy has the advantages of reduced cost, the potential for outpatient management, and avoidance of intravenous access, thereby obviating the risk of IVDR BSI.

If the risk is high, IV antimicrobials must be used; if risk is low, the patient may be treated with either intravenous or oral drugs. Second, decide whether the patient qualifies for vancomycin therapy. If the patient qualifies, begin treatment with a twoor three-drug combination, with vancomycin plus cefepime, ceftazidime, or a carbapenem, with or without an aminoglycoside. If vancomycin is not indicated, begin monotherapy with a cephalosporin (cefepime or ceftazidime) or a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin), administered intravenously for uncomplicated cases. Two-drug combinations are recommended for management of complicated cases or if antimicrobial resistance is strongly suspected.",

Therefore, duration of therapy usually cannot be guided by monitoring clinical resolution of a local infection or clearance of bacteremia. Scientific evidence to answer this important question is scant and does not permit definitive conclusions. The evidence-based 2002 IDSA Guideline for the management of granulocytopenic fever stratifies patients by duration of fever and, for patients who become afebrile by day 3, recommends discontinuation of antiinfective therapy if the patient's granulocyte count is 500 cells/mm 3 or higher for 2 consecutive days, there is no definite site of infection, and cultures remain negative. If the patient's granulocyte count is still less than 500 cells/mm 3 by day 7, but the patient was initially at low risk and there are no subsequent complications, therapy may be stopped when the patient is afebrile for 5 to 7 days. However, if the patient was initially considered to be high risk, antiinfective therapy should be continued (Figure 76 .11). 6 Patients with persistent fever for more than 3 days after initial therapy, for whom no infected site of organism has been identified, pose the greatest challenge. Persistent fever suggests that the patient has a nonbacterial, especially fungal, infection, a bacterial infection resistant to or slow to respond to the drug or drugs being given, the emergence of a superinfection, inadequate serum and tissue levels of the antibiotic(s), drug fever, or need for source control (e.g., an abscess or infected IVD). Although some patients with microbiologically defined bacterial infections, even when appropriately If no discernible improvement in the patient's condition has occurred (i.e., the patient remains febrile but stable) during the first 4 to 5 days of initial antimicrobial therapy, and if reevaluation yields no new information to the contrary, the initial regimen can be continued. This decision will be strengthened if the granulocytopenia can be expected to resolve within the ensuing 5 days.",

In a metaanalysis of 13 randomized, controlled trials comparing antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with antibiotics alone for granulocytopenic fever, Clark et al. found a decrease in length of hospitalization [RR, 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40-0.82; P less than 0.001] and a shorter time to granulocyte recovery (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.23-0.46; P less than 0.001); however, no effect on either overall mortality (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.43-1.08; P = 0.05) or infection-related mortality (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.33-2.20; P = 0.7) was observed. 235 Based on the available evidence, recent guidelines 6,236 that have addressed the use of G-CSF and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSF) in patients with cancer recommend against the routine use of hematopoietic growth factors. However, under certain conditions, with a worsening of the course and expected delay in marrow recovery, use of these agents may be appropriate with pneumonia, hypotension, or shock, severe cellulitis or sinusitis, systemic fungal infections, or multiorgan dysfunction secondary to sepsis. 6 Therapy with colony-stimulating factors could also be considered for patients who remain severely granulocytopenic and have documented infections that have failed to respond to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, such as gram-negative cellulitis.",

Thus, if an infected patient exhibits hypoxemia or hypotension refractory to initial fluid resuscitation, a flow-directed, balloon-tipped, pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) can be helpful to guide fluid therapy and decisions on choice of pressors and inotropic drugs, with the physiologic goal of optimizing oxygen delivery and uptake. Recent fear, based on a retrospective study, that PACs increase mortality in critically ill patients 239 has been dispelled by a large, multicenter randomized trial in older adult surgical patients showing that PACs can be used safely without increased mortality. 240 There are no data to indicate that colloid solutions, such as albumin, plasma protein fraction, or hydroxyethyl starch (hetastarch) are superior to crystalloids, such as 0.9% normal saline or Ringer's lactate, for support of the failing circulation in the patient with septic shock. Crystalloids should be the IV fluid of choice for treatment of sepsis and in the patient with shock and should be given aggressively in the first 4 to 6 hours, guided by the central venous pressure, to minimize mortality. 238 Novel Adjunctive Therapies For nearly 40 years, despite advances in antiinfective therapy and in ICU care, the mortality of septic shock has declined only marginally, pointing up the need to modulate the severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome that underlies shock, multiorgan dysfunction, and death. 213 Patients who have been receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy who develop sepsis need supplemental stress doses of corticosteroids, hydrocortisone 50 to 75 mg IV every 6 hours, to prevent acute adrenal crisis. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that these doses of hydrocortisone will improve survival in patients with severe sepsis. A recent multicenter, double-blind randomized trial in France found, in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, that adjunctive therapy with hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours and fludrocortisone 5 mg per day orally reduced mortality 30%. 241 It has long been recognized that most patients with septic shock have low levels of the essential physiologic anticoagulant, protein C. A recent international, multicenter trial was undertaken to assess the therapeutic effect of repleting protein C with a recombinant activated form (rhAPC) in patients with severe sepsis, 75% with shock. 242 The choice of protein C was influenced by knowledge of its capacity to modulate inflammation through inhibition of monocyte production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin (IL)-1b, inhibition of neutrophil activation, and downregulation of endothelial expression molecules, intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1, E-selectin, and VCAM-1. In the double-blind trial in 1,640 patients, a continuous infusion of rhAPC 24 mg/kg/min, begun within 24 hours of the onset of severe sepsis and continued for 96 hours, was associated with a 19% reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality (P = 0.005). There was a slight increase in bleeding complications in recipients of rhAPC (serious bleeding, 3.5% versus 2.0%; P = 0.06); however, rhAPC was well tolerated, considering the critical illness of most of the recipients. 242 The major contraindications to adjuvant use of rhAPC in cancer patients are active bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia (less than 30,000), or chronic renal or hepatic failure.",

Approximately 70% of deaths from acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) are ascribed to infection, the risk of which is inversely related to the absolute granulocyte count. Prevention of infection may allow patients to receive more intensive chemotherapy and thereby increase the rates of remission and overall survival. Concerted efforts have been made to protect the granulocytopenic patient from nosocomial infection during chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. Randomized trials have prospectively evaluated various procedures for protection of the granulocytopenic patient, including protective environments, the use of prophylactic nonabsorbable antibiotics, or both. 243 Most programs have been based on elaborate protocols for protection against both extrinsic and endogenous pathogens, typically isolating the patient in a room or tent with filtered ultraclean air and requiring persons entering the room to wear sterile overgarments, gloves, shoe covers, and masks. Such protocols have been supplemented by regular applications of cutaneous and orificial disinfectants, use of food and water low in microbial content, and continuous administration of prophylactic oral nonabsorbable antibiotics. Because the i n f e c t i o u s c o m p l i c at i o n s o f c a n c e r t h e r a p y expense of such complex programs is prohibitive for most hospitals, simple protective isolation (or reverse precautions) requiring that the person entering the room wear a clean gown, gloves, and mask is widely used as an alternative means to protect the granulocytopenic patient from infection. A prospective, randomized unblinded study to assess the efficacy of protective isolation in 37 granulocytopenic patients with 43 episodes of infection found no statistically significant differences in the overall incidence of infection, time to onset of first infection, or days with fever. 244 Neither response to antileukemic therapy nor survival was improved with isolation.",

The continued reintroduction of new multiresistant strains into the institution from interinstitutional transfers of unrecognized colonized patients has fueled the continued spread of multiresistant nosocomial organisms. Infection control policies must find ways to prevent both intra-and interinstitutional spread.",

Numerous studies have shown that the preemptive use of barrier precautions, also called \"protective isolation,\" can effectively prevent the spread of multiresistant organisms, such as MRSA or VRE, in an epidemic setting, 261, 262 and other studies have shown the effectiveness of protective isolation in high-risk populations, such as patients in an ICU, for prevention of endemic nosocomial infection, including spread by multiresistant organisms. 256, [263] [264] [265] [266] [267] Three prospective randomized trials have been conducted to assess the efficacy of preemptive barrier precautions 263, 264, 268 ; two showed benefit with a reduction in all nosocomial infections in ICU patients (relative risk reduction, 52% to 81%). 263, 264 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Prophylactic antimicrobials during granulocytopenia have been shown to reduce the frequency of febrile episodes; however, enthusiasm for the use of prophylactic antimicrobials has been damped by the adverse consequences of such a strategy, particularly emergence of multiresistant bacteria, superinfection by fungi, and toxicity from the antimicrobials used.",

Because these infections are difficult to diagnose and have high mortality, prophylaxis against fungal infections is an attractive approach for patients expected to have prolonged granulocytopenia. Numerous randomized trials assessing the efficacy of antifungal agents, most often fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin have been undertaken. The results are difficult to compare because of differing patient populations, myelosuppressive regimens, drug dosage and routes of administration, varying durations of prophylaxis, and lack of uniform case definitions. Nonetheless, most trials have found benefit for prevention of invasive fungal infections; however, a survival benefit was not consistently demonstrated. 272, 273 The risk of developing a potentially fatal invasive fungal infection increases in patients with hematologic (rather than solid organ) malignancy, duration of granulocytopenia, prolonged corticosteroid therapy, allogeneic and autologous bone marrow and stem cell transplantation, graft-versus-host disease, and concomitant viral infections. 274, 275 Therefore, the best studies of antifungal prophylaxis have focused on these high-risk groups. Fluconazole has been the most widely studied agent for prophylaxis in doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg daily. Goodman et al. found that 400 mg/day of fluconazole was superior to placebo in reducing both the incidence of invasive fungal infection and attributable mortality. 276 In the second trial, performed in pediatric and adult bone marrow transplant recipients, fluconazole, given for 100 days posttransplantation, reduced the incidence of invasive fungal infection when compared with clotrimazole troches. 277 Based on results from these and other studies that reported similar results, 400 mg/day fluconazole is recommended for patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.",
