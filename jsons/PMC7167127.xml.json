Of these viruses, rotavirus is the main cause of severe diarrhea in young children accounting in 2013 for more than 210,000 childhood deaths worldwide [Tate et al., 2016]. The recent addition of oral rotavirus vaccines onto the national immunization schedules of developed countries, such as Australia, has been followed by an overall decrease in childhood diarrheal illness [Buttery et al., 2011; Dey et al., 2012]. In these countries other enteric viral pathogens, especially noroviruses, are now the leading cause of severe childhood AGE [Koo et al., 2013].",

Successful national rotavirus vaccine programs and recent discoveries of novel viruses have raised important questions over the relative contributions of existing and emerging enteric viruses to childhood diarrhea. So far, most studies have been cross\u2010sectional, lacking suitable controls, and based in healthcare settings, increasing the likelihood of selection bias [Scallan et al., 2005; Lambert et al., 2012].

Parents recorded in a daily diary any fever, respiratory, or gastrointestinal symptoms in their infant and collected nose and stool swab samples weekly from birth until the infant's second birthday.

In order to inform the logistics for planning, a larger study involving all 158 infants in the birth cohort, a convenience sample of the first five ORChID participants to complete the study with a full set of stool samples were included in this pilot. At 2, 4, and 6 months of age, each had received three doses of oral human\u2010bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq; Merck & Inc., Co., NJ) as part of Queensland's publically funded immunization program (actual immunization dates confirmed by the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register).

Frequent shedding of one or more of the targeted six viruses was identified in weekly swabs, but often in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Of these six viruses, norovirus genogroup II, was found to have the highest proportion of positive detections associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and is consistent with its relative importance as a cause of AGE in young children already immunized against rotavirus infections [Koo et al., 2013]. These findings confirm and extend those of previous observations, including from two infants in the first year of life where there was almost constant shedding of various enteric viruses\u2014adenovirus, anellovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, and picobirnavirus\u2014in weekly stool samples with only occasional minor symptoms being present [Kapusinszky et al., 2012].",

Unlike co\u2010detection of different adenovirus genotypes, sequential detection of various adenovirus types as observed in subject 4 over a 10\u2010week period has received little attention in the literature. Two of the three genotypes (types 2 [subgenus C] and 31 [subgenus A]) had been detected intermittently beforehand in this subject. It is plausible that the serial detections reported in this infant represent independent reactivations of these two genotypes, whose genogroups infect lymphoid tissue at different sites of the gastrointestinal tract [Kosulin et al., 2015], followed by a new adenovirus type 1 [subgenus C] infection.",

While PCR is very sensitive, most detections in these stool samples were not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. Other studies have suggested that this limitation could be overcome in children with AGE by measuring viral loads using real\u2010time PCR Ct values and developing cut\u2010off values for detections that were meaningful clinically [Corcoran et al., 2014]. However, with this small sample population, only the Ct values for enterovirus detections were associated significantly with symptoms. Given enterovirus is recognized as only a minor contributor to AGE (any gastrointestinal symptoms are likely part of a more systemic illness, including fever and/or rash), and that the observed difference in Ct values between symptomatic and asymptomatic virus detections was relatively small (2.34 cycles or <1\u2010log difference in viral load), drawing further conclusions from these data must be done with caution. Moreover, unlike blood, where a defined volume/cell number can be quantified, it is difficult to accurately assess a viral load from stool samples that may vary widely in their fluid content. Although real\u2010time PCR Ct values from stool samples were used as a surrogate, semi\u2010quantitative estimate of viral load, this is still a limitation where Ct values in liquid stool may underestimate viral load.",

Additional questions for the ORChID cohort include further details on the nature and duration of virus shedding in the stools of healthy infants, if important biological differences exist between the major adenovirus and enterovirus genotypes shed in stools, including their associations with gastrointestinal (and other) symptoms, and whether a Ct value cut\u2010off can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy of viral AGE in young children.",
