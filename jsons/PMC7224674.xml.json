The condition was similar to viral pneumonia, as confirmed by clinical presentation. On January 7, 2020, it was confirmed that the cause of the pneumonia was a new coronavirus. Thereafter, this was named the 2019 novel coronavirus disease-COVID-19. Notably, COVID-19 induces mild symptoms that are similar to those induced by other respiratory infections. However, particularly, it affects older people with comorbidity and can result in fatal respiratory diseases (Chen et al., 2020). On January 10, 2020, the Chinese authorities reported the first death due to COVID-19. After that, cases have been reported in other countries such as Thailand and Japan.",

The epidemiological investigation by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) revealed that the 31 st patient belonged to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu and that she attended the church service on February 9 and 16 after she had experienced the symptoms of COVID-19 on February 7. In addition, it was revealed that 5,006 confirmed cases, which accounted for 61.3% of the 8,162 confirmed cases, were associated with the church cluster in Daegu (Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2020). Accordingly, KCDC guessed that on February 9, the mass infections had occurred, resulting in many secondary cases, and so COVID-19 rapidly propagated in South Korea.",

A reproduction number higher than unity means continued disease transmission. However, the value lower than unity means that the continuous transmission has ended, and the disease gradually decreases and disappears. Particularly, the basic reproduction number R0 in our model is simply given as follows:R0=\u03b20S0\u03b7N,and the effective reproduction number, Re, is given as follows: Re=\u03b2tSt\u03b7N.\n",

Because both first and second confirmed patients were immediately isolated at the airport on account of fever, we will consider the third confirmed case as the first in this study; the third confirmed patient returned to Korea from Wuhan, China on January 22 and remained free until confirmed on January 26. Therefore, we consider January 22 as the date of initial infection (t=0), and January 26 as the date of initial containment, I(0)=1 and Q(4)=1. Worship services were organized on February 9 (t=18) and 16 in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, Daegu, and the 31 st confirmed person had participated in this service, resulting in mass infection. The confirmed date of identifying for the 31 st confirmed patient is February 18 (t=27).

So, we used 1/\u03b7=3 (days) while assuming the presumed self-isolation to be approximately one day. The period from being isolated to discharged was taken to be 14.7 days from the data reported until March 13, 2020 from KCDC (Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2020).

The first patient was reported on January 20, 2020, but the transmission of the infection actually started from the 3rd confirmed patients from January 22 in Korea. Since then, the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea has resulted in 29 confirmed cases by February 18. In addition, it appeared that the outbreak was going to be controlled. It was shown that R0=1.77 in our model analysis. This is slightly lower than that of Wuhan, China (R0=2.24\u20133.58) (Zhao et al., 2020). Personal hygiene, such as wearing masks, handwashing and disinfecting items, seemed to have been maintained a certain level, since the first case of outbreak in China in December 2019 was announced in Korea. However, after the mass infection due to the 31 st confirmed patient in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus on February 9, the transmission rate of COVID-19 increased approximately 20 times. Since then, on February 18, after the confirmation of the 31 st patient, the transmission rate has halved in two days because of the high-level preventive control interventions across the nation and public volunteering. Moreover, Re=1.46 on February 26, and Re<1 on February 28, where 10 days after active control intervention was performed with successful investigations of prevention control. This supports previous result with the mean effective reproduction number of 1.5 on February 26 (Shim et al., 2020).",

For example, as of March 2 2020, countries such as Italy, the United States, Spain, Germany, and France still have more than 3000 confirmed cases per day and more than 100 deaths per day. However, in Korea, the outbreak has been reduced, as confirmed by the value of Re to less than unity within 10 days after the first mass infection was noticed. This reduction in the outbreak is attributed to the voluntary participation of the citizens in the preventive control interventions, for example, wearing masks, refraining outings, maintaining social distance, and banning group gatherings. Consequently, as of March 23, 2020, fewer than 100 confirmed patients per day were reported, and it seems that the outbreak is under control now. In Korea, it is needed for people to maintain the current momentum of preventive actions to prevent the further spread. Moreover, taking the case of Korea as a lesson, other countries maintain active implementation of preventive activities until vaccines or treatments are developed.",

Therefore, although our study provides a result of Re<1 since February 28, we are not sure what uncertainty such as another mass infection and passive preventive action, can be expected. As suggested in our study, an outbreak more severe than the current level may occur if there is another mass infection in future. Also, second big wave of outbreak may occur again caused by migrant although it seemed to have controlled as in Singapore case (A Singapore Government Agency, 2020). Even if the outbreak seems to have controlled in Korea, reemergence might be occurred at any time when it is prevalent worldwide. Therefore, the current-level preventive control interventions and voluntary preventive actions might be continued until the disease is entirely eliminated in worldwide. Accordingly, we suggest that the government policy of \u201csocial distancing\u201d which had been implemented in Korea until April 5 and extended to May 5 may be maintained even at a lower level.",
