A surgical mask placed over the nose and mouth of the patient is sufficient to trap the large particles generated through coughing or sneezing. However, these masks are incapable of filtering the virus once the expectorated material dries and the virus becomes airborne as a droplet nucleus. N-95 masks attain a filter efficiency of more than 95% through mechanisms including electrostatic filtration, sedimentation, and diffusion [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28].",

This includes performing the procedure when the least number of people are present in the operating room (OR) and limiting personnel in the patient's OR to only those who are essential for the procedure. ORs generally have positive pressure in relation to the outside hallways to decrease surgical infection risk. If available, ORs with antechambers are preferable for cases in which the patient may expose personnel to infection risk. All unnecessary equipment should be removed from the room to prevent contamination. Patients should be transferred directly to the OR in which the surgery will be performed. Everyone in the OR should use the full precautions discussed earlier. Bacterial/viral filters should be used on both the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the anesthesia machine. There are no recommendations regarding anesthetic technique. Care should be taken to avoid contamination of the anesthesia machine and cart. This may be accomplished by double-gloving and changing the outer pair of gloves after each patient contact. After the procedure, the patient must be recovered in isolation. This may require that recovery occur in the OR itself, or the patient's isolation room. All personal protective equipment should be removed before leaving the OR, because it may have become contaminated. New personal protective equipment should be put on for transport of the patient when leaving the OR. There is controversy as to whether or not N-95 masks should be reused. If adequate supplies are available, it is preferable to dispose of the masks after use, as they are potential fomites for the transfer of infection. If there is a shortage of masks, one recommendation is to wear a surgical mask over (not under\u2014this defeats the purpose of a tight seal that only allows air that is filtered inside the mask) the N-95 mask. This would decrease the gross soiling of the mask. The OR should remain vacant for a sufficient period of time to allow for 99.9% air turnover. For a room with five air changes per hour (ACH), 83 minutes would be required. At 10 ACH, this drops to 41 minutes, and only 28 minutes for 15 ACH. All surfaces should be disinfected with an agent that has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. The circuit and the gas sampling line should be disposed. All trash should be properly bagged and disposed of as per standard OR requirements. The tragically high infection rates of health care workers at the early stages of the epidemic makes it clear that these recommendations must be strictly adhered to in order to protect oneself and other health care workers [17], [26], [28], [29], [30].",

The disease has clearly not been eradicated though. There have been cases of SARS in laboratory workers where the source of contact was easily identified. However, beginning in December 2003, a growing number of sporadic cases, where the source of contact has yet to be identified, have been occurring. A coronavirus that has 99.8% sequence homology with human SARS-CoV has been identified in many animal species sold in the markets of southern China for human consumption (eg, palm civets, raccoon, dog, ferret, badger, cyanomolgus macaque, fruit bat, snakes, wild pigs). It is not yet known whether any of these animals can transmit the disease to humans, but the Chinese government instituted an eradication campaign for all palm civets in captivity and the US Government has placed an embargo on importation of the animals [31]. Whether SARS can be eliminated will depend on whether there is an animal reservoir or if it has became endemic in the human population. It remains to be seen if it will re-emerge with seasonal outbreaks similar to influenza. Will the disease become more or less virulent over time? Will it be possible to develop a treatment or neutralizing vaccine that the virus doesn't circumvent through mutation?",

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) develops drug resistance within months when treated with a single therapeutic agent, however. Multidrug therapy of adequate duration limits the probability that drug resistance will occur. Over the next two decades, many more drugs effective against MTB were identified: p-aminosalicylic acid (1949), isoniazid (1952), pyrazinamide (1954), cycloserine (1955), ethambutol (1962), and rifampin (1963). Between the mid-1950s and 1984 there was a steady decrease in the incidence of TB. It was thought to be a disease of the past. Resources (staff, funding, clinics, medication) for TB had dwindled. The World Health Organization (WHO) had only two full-time people assigned to work on TB. However, HIV, which increases the risk of developing active TB and subsequently the duration of infectivity, had begun to spread throughout the world. The conditions were ideal for re-emergence of TB. Between 1985 and 1992, surveillance for TB in the United States showed a 20% increase in the number of cases secondary to the HIV copandemic, poverty, medically underserved populations, congregate living situations (prisons, shelters, long-term care facilities), immigration from countries with endemic TB (Haiti, India, Mexico, China, Korea, Vietnam), and a decrease in public health services. In the early 1990s, an estimated 1.7 billion people (one third of the world population) were TB exposed, there were nearly 8 million new cases per year, and 2.9 million deaths were attributed to TB. It became clear that nothing short of a global TB control program would be effective. A program known by the acronym DOTS (directly observed therapy short-course), which relies on increased governmental commitment, surveillance, diagnosis, availability of drugs, and verification of treatment compliance, was initiated. In the United States, this has led to an annual decline in TB of 5% to 6%. All 22 of the highest burden countries\u2014which account for 80% of the global cases of TB\u2014have adopted DOTS. The World Health Assembly has established targets of reaching 85% cure rates and 70% detection rates of infectious cases [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37].",

The bacilli are released into the air as droplets when a person with pulmonary or laryngeal TB coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. Droplets travel no more than 3 feet from the source. Particles larger than 10 \u03bcm are trapped and cleared by the cilia in the upper airway without causing disease. However, as the droplets desiccate, they form droplet nuclei that may stay suspended in air currents and spread more widely. Droplet nuclei may be inhaled deeper into the bronchioles, thereby evading the mucociliary defenses of the host and leading to infection. In addition to pulmonary TB, other tissues that may become affected include the kidneys, brain, bones, joints, and genitourinary tract [38]. When MTB disseminates, it is known as miliary TB. Although rare, TB infection can occur through vertical transmission. Congenital TB is usually disseminated and carries a 50% mortality risk [39]. There is an approximately 10% lifetime risk of developing active TB after exposure. The highest risk is in the first 1 to 2 years. However, certain conditions predispose an individual to progression. Individuals who have HIV coinfection have a 7% to 10% risk per year of converting to active TB [40].",

Five units (0.2 mL) of purified protein derivative (PPD) are deposited subcutaneously. In the absence of anergy, induration will develop within 48 to 72 hours of testing if there has been exposure. Induration of 5 mm or more is a positive result in anyone who has HIV, chest radiograph consistent with active disease, duration of less than 12 weeks since exposure, or anyone who is immunocompromised. In all others, 10 mm or more is a positive response. There is cross-reactivity between Bacille of Calmette and Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) and PPD. The response to the BCG vaccine wanes with time, however, so a positive response to PPD testing is generally indicative of exposure to TB. The response to PPD may be attenuated if it has been a long time since TB exposure or previous testing. Periodic screening of at risk populations should use 2-step testing in anyone who has a negative PPD and if it has been more than a year since the previous test. The first test boosts the immune response and increases the positive predictive value of a second test performed 1 to 3 weeks later [24].",

Individuals who present with this constellation of symptoms should have sputum sampling (three samples collected 8\u201324 hours apart) for acid-fast bacillus staining and culture and a chest radiograph. Respiratory isolation precautions should be instituted until the patient is deemed not to be infectious (acid-fast bacillus\u2013negative on three successive sputum samples). Chest radiograph evidence of an acute process correlates with infectivity in those who are not immunocompromised or on steroid treatment. Culture-positive samples should be tested for drug sensitivity. MTB rapidly develops drug resistance in circumstances of nonadherence to therapy or inadequate treatment regimens. The worldwide prevalence of resistance to at least one drug is 10.7% (range 2%\u201336%) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, is 1% (range 0%\u201314%). It is currently estimated that 3.2% of the world's new TB cases are MDR-TB. We recently had a patient at our hospital with a strain of TB resistant to nine drugs. Treatment should be initiated based on the current CDC recommendations (Fig. 3\n, Table 2\n). Because of the implications of coinfection with HIV regarding the choice of therapy and the duration of treatment, HIV counseling and testing is recommended for anyone that has been diagnosed with TB. Baseline laboratory values for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and platelet count should be performed. Subsequent laboratory work should be based on known toxicities of the drugs used in treatment. If ethambutol is used, visual acuity and color vision should be assessed [40].",

            "text": "Prevention of transmission in medical facilities requires a combination of early identification, isolation, and treatment of infectious individuals with active disease, engineering controls, basic infection control measures, and the use of personal protective equipment. Elective surgery should be postponed in patients with TB until they are no longer contagious (three negative sputum smears, improving symptoms and chest radiograph). For surgeries that cannot be delayed, precautions should be used to minimize the risk of transmission. The patient should wear a surgical mask when outside of an isolation room. A surgical mask is adequate for trapping the droplets before they are released into the environment to become droplet nuclei. Unlike respiratory isolation rooms, ORs are never at negative pressure in relation to the outside hallways because of the risk it would carry for surgical site infections. However, choosing an OR with an antechamber or that is physically separated from other areas may reduce environmental exposure. Whenever possible, the case should be scheduled when the fewest health care workers risk exposure. The operating room doors should be kept closed, and personnel in the room kept to a minimum. Although there have been no reports of TB transmission from a contaminated ventilator, it is recommended that a HEPA filter be placed in the circuit between the patient and the ventilator. HEPA filters are rated to remove 99.97% of particles larger than 0.3 \u03bcm in diameter. When entering any area that could contain respiratory infectious particles, masks conforming to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health N95 standard should be used. For proper protection, fit testing for the specific brand of mask is required. The mask must make an airtight seal with the face to ensure that all inspired air is filtered through the mask. If the available N95 masks have an exhalation valve, a regular surgical mask must be worn over it to protect the surgical field from infection. Those individuals who cannot be successfully fit tested for an N95 mask should use a higher level of respiratory protection, such as a powered air purifying respirator. Recovery from anesthesia must take place with the same level of precautions. If there is no isolation room in the recovery room, this will generally mean the patient needs to recover in the OR or a respiratory isolation room. A room in which a patient with active TB has been present should not be entered unless necessary until there has been a 99.9% turnover of the air. The duration is dependent on the number of air exchanges per hour, but is generally in the range of 30 to 60 minutes for most ORs [24], [30].",

The poultry industry has been severely affected in many countries. Its global impact on human health has only been limited by its current lack of transmission from human to human. This could easily change through a recombination event between an avian and a human influenza virus. We will continue to be exposed to new disease-causing organisms through exposure to areas with no prior human habitation and increasing globalization. In addition, we are increasing the selection pressure on these organisms through agricultural pressure (farming conglomerates) and the widespread overuse of antimicrobial agents.
