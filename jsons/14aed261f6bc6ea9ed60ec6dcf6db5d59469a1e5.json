            "text": "In this study, we report that three human tumourogenic cell lines derived from both squamous and adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus were resistant to natural killer (NK) cell activity but were sensitive to lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cell activity. These oasophagnal carcinoma cell lines were LAK cell sensitive when grown both as anchorage dependent monolayer cultures and as 3-dimensional (3-D) tumorids. The relative abilities of tumor node lympbocytes (TNL), reference node lymhocytes (RNL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from oesophageal squamous carcinoma patients to generate LAK cell activity was investigated. While RNL and PBL exhibited high LAK cell activity, we were unable to generate LAK cell activity from TNL in the same patients. The addition of an oesophageal tumour derived immunosuppressor factor (ISF) to interleukin 2 (IL2) stimulated TNL, RNL and PBLinhibited the generation of LAK cell cytotoxicity. Similar inhibition of LAK cell cytotoxicity by ISF was observed with PBL from normal control donors. Inhibition occurred in a dose dependent fashion and was irreversible. The suppressive effect of ISF was most significant during the early stages of LAK cell generation and no inhibitory effect was seen when ISF was added directly to preformed LAK cells. ISF mediates its effect by inhibiting DNA synthesis which we have shown to be essential for LAK cell generation. The elaboration by tumom ceils of 1SF may partially explain the failure of LAK/IL2 therapy in some clinical and experimental protocols.",

C-erB-2 oneoprotein expression detected immunohistochemically in primary breast cancer is a potent poor prognostic variable for patients including Irish women t. 2 . Also primary C-erB-2 expression indicates hormone resistance in recurrent breast cancer and relative tumour resistance to low intensity chemotherapy with mitoxanthrone (data in press). Forty young women (median age 41 years) had staining for C-erB-2 in their primary tumonrs; 11 showed positive staining and 29 did not. All subsequently had recurrences of breast cancer and were then given intensiv e chemotherapy with doxombicin 40 mg/m 2 intravenously and ifosfamide/ mesna 5 g/m 2 by intravenous infusion over 24 hours, with mesna alone for 8 hours. Cycles repeated at 21 day intervals to a total of 4 cycles in patients with responsive tumours. Response rates in recurrences (82% C-erB-2+VE vs 72% C-erB-2-ve) median response durations, and post-treatment survival were no different between patients on the basis of primary turnout C-erB-2 expression. This strongly suggests that young women with operable breast cancer and expression of C-erB-2 should be selected for intensive doxombicin based nee-adjuvant/adjuvant chemother apy.",

Follicular carcinoma is associated with endemic goitre and increased iodine intake may explain its reduced incidence. Increased radiation may explain the increase in papillary carcinoma. There is a need for a National Tumour Registry to see if this local trend is reflected nationally. Considerable evidence from animal turnout systems suggest that proteolytic enzymes are involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. Levels of specific proteases in primary human cancers might thus be markers for metastatic potential of these turnouts. The aims of this investigation were therefore to investigate a number of different proteases as prognostic markers in breast cancer. Of six different proteases studies, two, i.e. cathespin D (CD) and urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) correlated significantly with both shortened disease-free interval and patient survival. Using tmivariate analysis, u-PA as a prognostic marker was of similar value to, axillary node status but stronger than that of tumour size, estrogen receptor (ER) status or CD. In multivariate analysis, u-PA as a prognostic marker was independent of nodal status, tumour size and ER status. In addition, using overall survival as end point, u-PA was a significant prognostic marker in both axillary node-negative and node-positive patients. We conclude that u-PA is a new and independent prognostic marker in breast cancer. The discovery of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes provides a molecular basis for studying the pathogenesis of malignant disease. A number of molecular defects have been described in several types of cancer, notably retinoblastoma, Wilm's Tumour. coloreetal cancer and breast callcar. In our own time we have described allele loss on chromosome 17q in ovarian cancer. This loss of genetic material is thought to represent inactivation of a 99 tumour suppressor gene.

One hundred and eighty consecutive patients with breast cancer (mean age 57.5+1.0 yrs.) were investigated in this study; 100 after therapeutic intervention Previously, the outwardly-rectifying chloride channel (ORDIC) was believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. It has now beendiscredited in favour of a small conductance linear chloride channel, recently located in cells transfected with the gene coding for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator. The ORDIC but not the linear channel is sensitive to the stilbene, DIDS. Apical additions of DIDS (0.5raM) to T84 monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers were without effect on cAMPstimulated short-circuit current (Ise), thus confirming lack of involvement of the ORDIC in electrogenic chloride secretion. Baselateral additions of DIDS (10-160p.M) caused large concentration-dependent and bumetanide-sensitive increases in Ise. These responses were occlusive with those of the calciuna-etevating agent, thapsigargin, but they were synergistic with those of cyclic nucleotide-elevating agents. These results suggested a common intracenular pathway for DIDS and thapsigargin. Further, D1DS responses were blocked by calcium removal from the basolateral side. In whole-cell patch clamp experiments DIDS caused an increase In chloride conductance with characteristics similar to those of thapsigargin and innomycin. Therefore, in T84 mono layers and single cells, DIDS elevates intracellular calcium. The resulting conductance changes depend on the degree of cell differentiation. *Present address: Elan Corporation, Department of Chemistry, Trinity College, Dublin 2. tological grading systems, very little evidence is given to such systems in therapeutic decision making. This is largely because such systems lack objectivity and consequently would appear to be inaccurate assessors of histological behaviour in carcinomas. Hence the search for more objective prognosticators such as ploidy. Our study involves 252 patients assessed and treated in one centre over a five year period. All patients were treated initially with lumpeetomy and radiotherapy. The mean patient age was 57 years and 71% were post-menopeusal. Pathologic grade, necrosis and amount of in-situ tumour component were assessed on I-I/E sections. Histological grade was assessed using the Bloom and Richardson method. Ploidy was assessed via flow cytometry and image analysis. Findings suggest that pathologic grade is strongly associated with ploidy status. When the individual components of pathologic grade are examined, the correlationis greatest of thenuclear components. Plnidy also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the presence of tumour necrosis and an inverse correlation with the presence of in-situ turnout component. In multivariate analysis, however, ploidy lost its prognostic value. In conclusion, ploidy is of limited value in the light of a full rigorous histopathological assessment. Amplification failure using the pofymerase chain reaction is encountered by those using archival fixed paraffin wax-embedded histopathological material t.z. such \"failures\" may not be due to absent target DNA sequences in the tissues, but may be a direct effect of the type of fixative, fixation time and/or fixation temperature used. In this study, the effect of nucleic acid preservation in tissues and its suitability for use in thepolymerase chain reaction according to fixative type, time and temperature were evaluated. 100 mg pieces of tonsillar tissue were fixed in formal saline, 10% formalin, neutral buffered formaldehyde (NBF), Carney's, Bouin's buffered formaldehyde sublimate, Zenker's, Helly's and glutaraldehyde at 0-4~ room temperature and 37~ fixation temperature and for fixation periods 6, 24, 48, 72 in's and 1 week.

LFA-I binds to the ligand ICAM-I and pgp-1 has recently been identified as the hyalauronic acid receptor. LFA-I expression is normally biphasic on peripheral blood leucocytes but uniphasic on activated lymphocytcs. We studied the patterns of expression of LFA-I and CD44 in both peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (syn) T cells of 18 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and compared this to expression in normal peripheral blood T cells using two colour FACSCAN analysis. CD44 was expressed on all T ceils in both PB and syn. The density of expression (mean flourescence intensity [MFI] of CD44 in peripheral blood T cells did not differ between RA and controls.

All but one patient had an increase in synovial lymphocyte CD44 expression ranging from 19 to 425% (mean 115). 14/18 RA patients and 9110 control subjects (C S) had a biphasic pattern of LFA-1 expression in PBLs. By contrast 15/18 RA patients had a uniphasic pattern of LFA-1 hi expression on synovial lymphocytes. These findings are consistent with the concept that cells expressing high density of homing receptors selectively home to the rheumatoid synovium. An alternative explanation may be that local T cell activation induces enhanced expression. Chronic arthritis in childhood may cause substantial social, psychological and physical impairment. This study examined family and peer relationships in adults with chronic arthritis since childhood using the Mother-Father-Peer Scale (MFPS) which measures the patient's perception of these relationships compared to population norms.",

INHIB1TOR AND INHIBITION OF THE INFLAMMA-TORY RESPONSE IN SLE AND RA   E . Wallace, C. Feighery, J. Jackson. Department of Immunology, St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Cl-inhibitor (CI-INH) is an important inhibitor of the inflammatory response. Measurement of the interaction of CI-INH with activated inflammatory mediators may give clues as to the involvement of these mediators inproceases. In this study a sensitive assay which can detect interactions between CI-INH and activated inflammatory mediators is applied to patients with SLE and RA. The assay is based on antibody capture of CI-INH from plasma. Plasma from 20 normal controls, 18 patients with S LE, and plasma and synovial fluid from 7 patients with RA were examined for the presence of cleaved CI-INH and CI-INH pretense complexes. In nine of the 18 patients with SLE an increase in the amount of CI-INH complexes and in the quantity of cleaved CI-INH was found. This is consistent with increased utilisation of CI-INH by activated complement components. However, there was no apparent increase in either cleaved or complexed CI-INH in synovial fluid of patients with RA in comparison with their plasma suggesting that CI-INH consumption is not increased at the site of active inflammation in RA. These results are very surprising in view of the widely held view that immune complexes formed in thej oint are inv ely ed in the inflammatory process in RA. Employment of this assay may yield important information on the function of CI-INH in health and disease. Epidenfiological studies have shown that vitamin C intake is inversely correlated with the incidence of coloreetal carcinoma. Colonic crypt cell proliferation is used as an indicator of risk of coloreetal cancer. This study assesed the effect of vitamin C supplementation on the colonic crypt cell proliferation of patients with adenomatous polyps. Twenty patients with adenomatous polyps were recruited. Ten were supplemented with 750 mg of vitamin C daily for one month. Ten received nc supplementation, Four colonic biopsies were taken before and at the end of the trial period. These were assessed for colonic crypt cell proliferation using the bromedeoxyuridine immunohistochemical technique. The mean labelling index percent (LI%) is calculated as the percentage ratio of the mean number of proliferating cells to the total number of cells in the crypt. Dietary fat may be a risk factor in the aetiohigy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Adipose tissue fatty acid composition is a reliable indicator of the quality of fat consumed and was used to investigate the relationship between the quality of fat consumed and IBD. Abdominal adipose tissue biopsies of 26 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, 22 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 24 controls were analysed by gas liquid chromatography. Results were expressed as mass percentage total fatty acids. The fatty acid composition of the three groups were similar with regard to i) the saturated fatty acids C14:0 and C18:0, ii) the major monounsaturated fatty acids C16:1 and C18:l and iii) the major polyunsaturated fatty acid C18:2 (n-6). The principal abnormalities in the IBD were that i) CD patients had significantly higher levels of C16:0 (21.85% vs 20.62%) and lower levels of C20:1 (n-9) (0.78% vs 0.92%) than UC patients and ii) CD patients had significantly lower levels of C18:3 (n-3) (0.7% vs 0.98%) than controls. The major fatty acids found hi adipose tissue were the same in IBD patients and controls, indicating similar patterns of fat consumption. Metabolism of some lipids is altered in the IBD population. The level of the eicosanoid precursor C18:3 (n-3), is reduced in the adipose tissue of IBD patients. This may reflect increased production of active mediators of inflammation in IBD. As part of a (larger) trial evaluating the optimum method of staging gastro-intestinal cancer, 72 patients with foregut cancer were examined. All had histological diagnosis of malignancy made on endoscopic biopsy. They were then entered into the trial aflzr informed consent had been obtained. Ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) were performed, followed by laparoscopy (the results of imaging tests were not known by the surgeon at this stage). Biopsy of all suspicious lesions was undertaken at laparoscopy. The results of all tests were then discussed and further biopsies, as necessary, were obtained using imaging methods. Of the 72 people examined, laparoscopyconfirmed metastases in 25, CT in 17, and US in 9. In addition CT gave one false positive and 2 equivocal results. In those with metastatic spread to the peritoneal cavity, laparoscopy was the only method that allowed assessment of response of these tumours to chemotherapy. Therefore we feel that for the cost of effective and accurate pre operative staging of gastric cancer, that CT with biopsy of suspicious areas should be the first method of staging. This should be followed by laparoscopy and biopsy in those that have neg ative CT scans. Laparoscopy is the best method for follow up of local responses of the tumour to chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown that involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in Crohn's disease is more extensive than is revealed by conventional histology. In the apparently uninvolved tissue as judged by routine histology, neuronal abnormality and in creased enzyme activity have been demonstrated. The object of this study was to assess the lymphocyte concentration in the histologically normal mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease.",

Sixteen infants (gestatinnal age 33-38 weeks) born to diabetic mothers had ultrasound kidney measurements during the first week of life. The measurements were kidney length (KL) and transverse diameter (TSVD) at right angles to the renal pelvis. Body measurements included birthweight, bodyweight, and midarm circumference (MAC). Penderal Index (PI) was calculated from the formula PI = (Birthweight (g)/Bodylength (cm) 3) x 100. All mothers had at least two blood sugar profiles thlring pregnancy (range 2-28, mean 11). The mean for each of the profile tfines (fasting, 1030,1530, 2030, 2330h) for each mother was calculated.

We present the data on 218 consecutive patients with TB treated with Rifator (combination RHZ) and who have been followed for up to 2 years post completion of treatment. Comparison with previous series (IMJ, 1989; 82: 11-13) shows: that patients had fewer visible cavities on X-ray (p--0.0004); more patients negative direct/positive culture (p=0.02); no difference in terms of radiological extent of disease, plenral effusion, extrapulmonary TB, drug toxicity, mortality, other reasons for withdrawal from therapy. More patients are consistently culture negative when treated with Rifater at one month and two months compared to the other regimens -RHEZ x 6 months, RHE x 9 months.",

This study presents the first profile of NIDDM in Ireland. The objective was to focus attention upon NIDDM as a possible health problem in Ireland. Five hundred and one cases (233 male, 268 female) presented to our clinic over five years (Jan. 1 1980 -Dec. 31 1984). Incidence in females increased progressively with age but in males peaked at 50-59 years and declined significantly thereafter. 72% males vs 47% females were younger than 60 years.

Five hundred and eighty-four cases (254 males, 330 females) comprise a complete cohort diagnosed diabetic between 1960-1964 (inclus.). At 20-25 years DM 183 attended regularly, 156 had defaulted and 245 were deceased. 76% females, 69% males aged 30-50 years at diagnosis survived 20 diabetes years compared with 91.4% IDDM cases (n=147). Clinic attenders were examined for complications in 1985. Nephropathy (DN) was uncommon, even in IDDM (13% including deceased), and was associated with male gender (22.5% vs 6.2% females). 70% cases had some retinopathy (DR). 20% had proliferative DR. Significant DR related to higher systolic blood pressure in IDDM cases without DN (134.5+14.8 vs 12.5.0\"a:13.8 mmHg,p<0.001 ). 40% hadnetmopathy andprevalence of neuropathy increased with age. Macrovascular disease (MVD) in survivors was associated with male gender (24.3% vs 11.9% females). MVD accounted for 66% deaths. 56% males vs 41% femalas died from cardiovascular disease. Diabetes related canses accounted for 40% IDDM deaths. This study is the first audit of diabetes morbidity and mortality in Ireland, but reflects experience at a specialist centre. It reports results which can be utilised to define targets towards improving health and the life expectancy of Irish diabetics. Diabetes associated MVD is identified as a problem which requires urgent national attention. As no contemporary data was available on iodine status in Ireland, this study was established with a view to providing regional information on dietary iodine intake. Casual urine samples were obtained in a representative group from five different counties in Ireland, namely Dublin, Cork, Galway, Meath and Tipperary. Iodine levels were measured in urine specimens using the alkaline ashing technique. Mean urinary iodine excretion values + SE varied from a high of 125.4+11.4 pg in Tipperary to a low of 73.4_+4.3 ~tg in Galway. Mean values for Cork, Dublin and Meath were 88.2_+5.9/.tg, 97.2_+1.8 gg and 90.6_+6.3 p.g respectively. At low levels of iodine excretion, i.e, less than or equal to 50 pg, a.pproximately one fifth of subjects fell into this category in all counties. At the other end of the scale, i.e. values greater than or equal to 150/.tg (minimum level recommended by the WHO) the percentage of subjects in this category showed a wide variation between groups, with percentages varying from 4.1% to 25.3%. The relatively high percentage of elevated values in Tipperary (25.3%) presumably reflects an increase in dietary iodine intake due to the local practice of using iodized salt. The results, while excluding severe iodine deficiency in the study population obscure the fact that 21.6% had iodine excretion values less than or equal to 50 lag, consistent with iodine deficiency, reflecting the lack of iodine supplementation. The absence of significant regional variation in the study population cart be attributed to the homogeneity of the Irish diet. To establish some epidemiological features of chronic fatigue syndrome, questionnaires were sent to patients fulfil ling the diagnostic eriteria, Two hundred and ninety-one (74%) were returned detailing patient characteristics, course of illness and current health status. The mean age at onset was 33 years (range 5-76 years) with an overall female : male ratio of 2:1. The sex ratio varied with age; in patients under 20 years old the ratio was 1:1 compared with 2.6:1 and 1.7:1 in the 20-39 and over 40 years age groups respocfively (p=0.019). Patients had been ill for on average 5.22 years (range 6 months -26 years) and although tending to have frequent relapses most felt that they were improving. Fifty-four (18.6%) patients reported they had recovered, with younger patients (<20 years) having a significantly higher recovery rate of 40.5% (p=0.001). The average duration of illness was 2.9 years. We believe this to be the first population study of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome attending a regional referral centre using striet diagnostic criteria and helps establish the pattern of illness and prospects for recovery. Counties with the greatest deprivation were Donegal, Louth, Offaly and Dublin and the least deprived counties were Roscommon, Meath, Cavan and Leitrim. County SMR's were correlated with both deprivation indexes and no significant correlation was found to explain the apparent differences in mortality. This is in contrast to that found elsewhere.",

In March 1990 a regular monthly medical audit w as commenced at University College Hospital, Galway. We evaluated the experience o f one year's audit of medical inpatients. Ten case notes with a specific discharge diagnosis were reviewed according to a def'med protocol. All seven physicians were included. The protocol consisted of a detailed questionnaire with yes or no answers covering admission, documentation, investigation and treatment. We evaluated the impact of medical audit by comparing the initial three months with the last three months of the year. Overall attendance was poor for both consultants and N.C.H.D.S. Significant improvement was noted in a limited number of areas (i.e. documentation). Deficiencies in management and recording of patient data were noted and recommendations to improve these have been agreed. With a part time audit assistant we are expanding the audit and expect it to have major impact on hospital care in the future. The animals were allocated to one of 2 groups. The treatment group received PTF 25 mg/kg, (n=5), 30 rain. after induction of shock. The control group (n=5) were givennormal saline. Arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output were measured at 30 rain. intervals. The animals were observed for 24 hours. Haemodynemic parameters were similar in both groups before and during the shock period. All the lrl'F animals survived for 24 hours. One of the controls died during shock, the others survived for 11/2, 2~/4, 7, and 24 hours respectively. PTF significantly improved survival from hacmorrhagic shock (p<0.05, log rank test).

Two post-operative patients developed oliguric renal failure which did not respond to standard therapy such as optimization of haemodynamic variables or low dose dopamine. Both patients had undergone laparuscopy for emergency bowel surgery and required further laparotomies for deteriorating conditions. Bladder pressures were used as a measure of I.A.P. and findings pre and post laparotomy are shown in Table I The renal function of patient A who had 3 litres of haematoma evacuated recovered completely. Patent B who had 3 litres bowel secretions evacuated had an initial improvement in renal function which deteriorated. These cases highlight: (1) the contribution of raised I,A.P. to oliguric renal failure. (2) That this component is not responsive to manipulation of perfusion pressure because of elevated renal vascular resistance. (3) The importance of early detection of raised LA,P.

Twenty four patients having elective CABG with ejection fraction >50% were randomly assigned to two groups. After induction of anaesthesia, baseline lactate, cardiac index ((2I), systemic v ascular resistance (SVR) and DO2/VO2 were measured. The treatment group received an infusion of Dolmxamine at 2 ug/kg/min and the controls received saline. Recordings continued at preset intervals for thirty hours. Lactate rose significantly in both groups (P<O.05) and remained elevated for twenty four hours. However in the group receiving Dopexamine, CI and DO2/VO2 were significantly greater (P<0.05) and SVR was significantly lower than in controls (P<0.05) and lactate levels fell more rapidly in this group. This study demonstrates that the significantly augmented VO2, coupled with the more rapid clearance of lactate were related to the inotropically augmented DO2. This suggests that prophylactic augmentation of DO2 by pharmacological manipulation would be a rational therapeutic option in the critically ill patient. Cardiac involvement in the form of conduction abnormalities or aortic regurgitation occurs clinically in 5-10% of patients (pts) with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). This study assesses the prevalence of subclinical cardiac abnormalities in pts with AS and attempts to correlate these abnormalities with clinical features.",

This study set out to measure cystathionine I$synthase (CS) activity in human leucocyts to evaluate its potential as a screening procedure for this condition. Leuooeytes, isolated from 20 ml of blood, were cultured in the presence of the mitogen, phyto hacmagg lutinin for 72 hr prior to homoganisation and incubation with buffered homos~,steine and [t~C]-serinc. The conversion (%) of[J4C]-serineto [1\"C] -cys tathinnine, following seperatinn by thinlayer chromatography, was used as an index of enzyme activity. In a range of healthy laboratory volunteers (n=10) the mean CS activity (% conversion of [14C]-serine/mg leucocyte protein) was 12.5%. For 3 children, clinically diagnosed as homozygous homocysteinurics, no activity was detected. In the mother of one of these children, by implication hetorozygous for the condition, the CS activity was 4.7% and two adult hyperhomocysteinacmic patients had a mean activity of 7.5%. These data indicate some potential for this assay in screening individuals with homocysteinaemia for a more precise and convenient characterisation of the condition. In homocysteinaemia, raised serum homocysteine levels may play a role in superoxide production, resulting in increased free radical activity and atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate free radical activity (by measuring serum Malondialdehyde (MDA), by the thiobarbituric acid assay), and also antioxidant status (by measuring serum vitamin E and A by HPLC) in CHD patients with homocysteinaemia (n 16, mean age (SD) 44 (4.6) years), CHD patients without homocysteinaemia (n 20, mean age (SD) 47 (4.9)years) and in control subjects without overt disease (n 19, mean age (SD) 45 (6.1) years). There was no difference in antioxidant status between the three groups, however there was some evidence for increased lipid peroxidation in CHD patients without homocysteinacmia, mean setalm MDA (SD) 1.7 (0.6) nmol/ml (P<0.05), compared with homocysteinacmics 1.3 (0.38) and controls 1.3 (0.31) nmol/1. These results do not therefore support the hypothesis that free radical activity is implicated in the pathogenesis of CHD in homocysteinaemia, though it may be of importance in CHD of different aetiologies. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) allows us examine the effect of hypothermia in humans. In a controlled prospective randomised study, patients were divided into three groups of 24 patients each and theCPB in each group was managed at adifferent temperature. Group A: cooled to 25 degrees, Group B to 28 degrees and Group C to 37 degrees. Serum lactate levels were measured arid the parameters of oxygen delivery (I)O2), and oxygen consumption (vo2) were calculated at ten minute intervals during CPB.",

There was no significant difference in lactate production between the groups. This supports the concept of a biphasic relationship between I)O2 and VO2 and suggests that the \"critical I)O2\", that is the level of I)O2 at which the VO2 reaches a maximum, is lower during hypothermia. This physiological relationship would be of importance in the management of oxygen debt in the critically ill. Urgent cardiac surgery is usually recommended for atrial myxoma, although evidence from Ireland and UK to support this approach is lacking. We reviewed all patients admitted to the National Cardiac Surgery Unit with atrial myxoma to assess pre-operative diagnosis and management, surgical technique, and outcome. Twenty three patients were admitted to the Unit since 1977. Preoperative symptoms were: congestive cardiac failure ( 10 patients), embolism (8 patients), constitutional (3 patients), tachyarrhythmia (1 patient) and asymptomatic (1 patient). The diagnosis was confh'med by D2 echocardiography alone in eleven patients and by a combination of echo and angiography in twelve patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in one patient. One patient collapsed on induction of anaesthesia. At operation the site of the tumour was left atrial in 22 patients, with one patient having an extensive bi-atrial tumour. In all cases the turnout was examined histologically. All patients made a good post-operative recovery, although one patient developed a DVT. One patient died five months post-op with a CVA. Serial echocardiography has revealed one recurrence to date (8 years post-op); the original tumour was an extensive bi-atrial tumour in a 24 year old girl. Re-operation was successful. Although benign, atrial myxomas require both urgent surgery due to their potentially serious sequelae, and diligent long term follow-up to detect recurrence. Transcutaneous non-invasive cardiac stimulation has inherent disadvantages: low success, high current requirements, lack of atrioventricular (AV) sequential pacing capability, and poor patient tolerance. We have developed a new hexapolar gastro-oesophageal (GO) electrode which allows separate atrial, ventricular and AV sequential pacing. The electrode is passed into the stomach under light sedation and positioned by withdrawing the steerable tip until it meets the resistance of the GO junction. Ventricular pacing is performed using a cathodic point source mounted distally on the electrode tip and a high impedance chest pad. A filtered bipolar oesophageal electrogram is obtained by scanning the lower oesophagus using successive adjacent combinations of five ring Hospital, Dubliri.

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is an important cytokine which has been extensively investigated since its discovery in 1975. There is little information on the flux of TNF through the circulationinvivo. Weinvestigated the dynamics of TNF by measuring levels simultaneously at different sites in the circulation. We studied 5 men with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) tmdergoing cardiac catheterisation. 2 ml of blood was withdrawn simultaneously from the pulmonary artery (PA), femoral artery (FA) and vein (V), after removal of dead space.

We present a review comparing the profile of patients presenting for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) less than 40 years of age with patients aged 40 years or more. There were 209 patients less than 40 years (group 1) and 6467 patients greater than 40 years (group 2). The mean age of group 1 was 36.5 years and was 56.5 years in group 2. The majority of patients in both groups were male. No difference was found between the groups when examined for sex distribution, anginal status, myocardial infarction, left ventricular function or the number of grafts performed. Group 1 patients had a higher proportion of good distal vessels and a lower proportion of poor distal vessels when compared with group 2 (p<O.0005*). Patients in group 1 had a significantly higher incidence of familial disease (13<0,05\") and were more likely to smoke (13<0.005\") than patients in group 2. No difference was found between the groups when examined for in-hospital, 30 day, one year and five year mortality. There was no difference between the groups in patients with grade IH or IV angina at the one or five year follow-up. A higher proportion of group 1 patients had returned to work at follow-up. In conclusion, younger patients tend to have better preserved distal vessels, are much more likely to smoke and have a positive family history. There is no significant difference between early and late mortality nor between recurrence of angina. In our unit, we favour general anaesthesia and generally avoid shunting during carotid endartrectomy.

Other clinical parameters are weakly correlated with lung function after treatment. We have used a non invasive technique to sequentially measure renal blood flow in hypoxic respiratory failure. Duplex Doppler ultrasound of renal interlohar arteries was performedon 16 patients with hypoxic respiratory failure (PaO2<8kPa) while hypoxic and again following 20% improvement in arterial blood oxygen tension. (COPD-12, asthma-l, bronchiectasis-1, interstitial lung disease-1). An Acuson 128 computerised real-time sonography system with a 2.0 MHZ imaging transducer was used to scan the renal vessels via the translumbar route with the patient in the sitting position. Pulsat~lity Index (Pl) was calculated as a measure of renovascular resistance. PI is obtained by dividing the difference between the maximum systolic height and the minimum diastolic height of the waveform by the mean height. A fall in PI corresponds to a fall in the distal resistance to flow. All results were paired observations with each patient acting as his or her own control, The data was analysed using Student's t test. A rise in blood o xygen tension of >20% was accompanied by a significant fall in PI (P<0.001).",

Vincent's Hospital, Dublin Histological studies have demonstrated an increase in the relative amount of Type I to Type III collagen in the fibrotic lung. Deposition of newly synthesized collagen is aecomnpanied by the release of N-end C-terminal peptides from proenllagen precursors, The aim of the present study was to ascertain if the relative levels of Type I and Type HI procollagen peptides in B AL or serum might reflect fibrosis in patients with interstitial lung disease OLD). Procollagen peptide (PCP) levels were analysed in BAL and serum samples from 20 patients with ILl). No patient was on eorticosteroid treatment at the time of study. Patients were divided into three categories: C1 = patients with no X-ray evidence of interstitial involvement (n=5); C2 = patients with interstitial infiltrates but no evidence of fibrosis (n=9) and C3 = patients with X-ray evidence of fibrosis (n=6). BAL levels of both Type I and HI PCPs increased with increasing lung involvement (Type I vs Category: F ratio = 3.43, p<0.05; Type FII vs Category: F ratio = 8.51, p<0.00l ). The proportion of Type I to Type HI PCP in BAL also increased with increasing lung involvement. Serum levels of either peptide alone did not distinguish ILl) patients from normal control subjects. However, the contribution of Type Ill PCP to to tat serum procollagen peptide levels was increased in C3 patients (p<0.04 vs control group). These results suggest that BALlevels of PCPs reflect the alteration in deposition of Type I and Type HI collagens found in the fibrotic lung and that the relative proportion of Type HI PCP in serum may reflect increased collagen deposition in the lung. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin. Four hundred and fifty biopsy-proven patients have been followed regularly, since 1981, at the Sarcoidosis Clinic. Comprehensive clinical data was recorded using spreadsheets and databases held on a personal computer system. The aim of this study was (1) to identify useful analyses of radiological changes/patterns in the management of sarcoid; (2) to assess the effectiveness of our present database techniques in managing CXR follow-up data. Complete 5-yr data with use of a modified Siltzbach and 1LO/ UC radiological scoring system in addition to complete clinical data is available for 127 patients (68 females, mean age 30 yrs) from an initial total of 311 patients (mean age 31 yrs; 159 males). The mainpresenting complaints werepulmonary symptoms (18%); acute erythema nodosum (17%); ocular (16%) while 16% were asymptomatie at presentation. Total  initial  18  76  110  71  21  296  2 yrs  36  23  61  53  25  198  5 yrs  20  6  25  50  26  127 Semi-quantitative measurements of nodal size and parenchymal perfusion showed changes in up to 50% of patients who had unchanged CXR staging. Detailed analysis of CXR and clinical patterns provides more accurate estimations of prognosis over time in sareoidosis. Our present sarcoid database requires modification to allow more efficient and accurate data maintenance and follow- Recent studies suggest that the release of small quantities of nantrophil protease may play a role in disease charaeterised by a low-grade inflammatory response. In this study, a competitive ELISA,designed to detect low levels of nentrophil elastase in biological fluids, was established. The detection limit (2.5 ng/ ml) and range (2.5 -100 ng/ml) of the assay represented an improvement in sensitivity compared m previously reported assay systems. Validation of the assay was achieved by assessment of elastase levels in plasma from normal subjects and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Low background absorbances indicated little non-specific interference in the system. Normal plasma levels (2.4 + 1.0 ug.ml, n=20) were similar to those reported by other investigatorsL As expected, significantly higher levels (5.5:L3.9 ug/ml, n--42; p<0.001) were observed in plasma from CE patients. Measurement of elastase in brnnchovalvenlar lavage (BAL) fluids from a group of patients with interstitial lung disease indicated that 3 of 5 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) had elevated BAL elastase levels compared with only 2 of 30 patients with sarcoidosis and none of 4 patients with exta'insic allergic alveolitis. As IPF is associated with elevated BAL neutrophils, these results lend validity to the proposal that elastase can serve as a sensitive marker for in vivo neutrophil degranulation. Ireland has a TB rate of 22:100,000 and we treat 30% of reported cases. In the period 1980-1985 we treated 1641 patients for TB; 2 were known i.v. drug abusers (IVDA); none were positive for human immunodefieiency virus (HIV). Of 1000 TB patients seen since 1986, 18 were HIV related and 6 were 1VDA.",

H. Robinson. Department of Child Health, The Queen's University of Belfast, Institute of Clinical Science, Grosvenor Road, Belfast BT12 6B J, Northern Ireland.Childhood encephalopathy is a devastating illness. The cause is often obscure. Our aim was to study patients with Reye's and related syndromes for IEM using inter alia the technique of gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on urine. 1:1:79-31:12:86 -57 padents (median age 0.75 yr) met British Reye's Syndrome Surveillance Scheme (BRSSS) criteria. Of 50 survivors, 40 were studied retrospectively. No case has yet been proven to have an IEM. Two of the original 57 may have an IEM, in one possibly a mitochondrial long chain fatty acid beta-oxidation defect (LCD). 1:1:87-31:12:88 -Among 15 patients who did not meet BRSSS criteria, 2 have a proven IEM -1 medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenaso (MCAD) deficiency, and 1 ethylmalonic-adipic aciduria; 1 other likely had an LCD, 1:1:89-30:11:91 -Among 19 patients with a similar Reye-like illness, 6 have a proven IEM -3 MCAD deficiency, 1 long chain 3 hydroxy acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, 1 glutaric aciduria-typeI, 1 vit. B 12 respomive mcthyhnalonic aciduria and one child with a presumed ketolytic defect.In conclusion -No RS patient has yet been shown to have an IEM. Since 1988 these are being increasingly recognised in patients presenting with a Reye-like encephalopathy as a result of improved diagnostic technology using GC-MS.A NEONATAL HEARING SCREENER E.

Although T lymphocyte function appeared to be impaired in comparison to the control group, disease stage did not correlate with this impairment. In conclusion, we have found no evidence to suggest that cell mediated immune faction is a significant factor in the progression of breast carcinoma. *Student T Test.

The role of early dipyridamole technetium (Tc) 99m MIBI scintigraphy, when used to identify patients who are at greater risk of developing subsequent ischaemic events was evaluated prospectively. Thirty patients who had an uncomplicated acute non Q wave MI confirmed by CK (MB) elevation were studied. All patients had a resting Tc 99m MIBI scan performed. Following an IV infusion of dipyridamole 0.56 mg/kg a repeat Tc 99m MIBI scan was performed. Coronary angiography was performed on all patients.

The aims of this study were to assess the incidence of tubereulosis in the Irish human immunodeficiancy virus (HIV) infected population, and to assess the usefulness of tuberculin skin testing as an indicator of active tuberculosis in this population. Between February and September 1988 thirty-eight HIV positive patients were recruited into the study. A skin test score was derived for each patient using the Mulfitest system. Patients were reviewed in January 1991, ten had died, three were lost to follow-up, and twenty-five were alive. The mean follow-up period was 22 months (range 6-34). Eleven patients were tuberculin positive on entry into the study; one of these developed tuberculosis. Twenty seven patients were tuberculin negative; three of these developed tuberculosis. Differences in the incidence of myobacterial infection between tuberculin positive and tuberculin negative individuals are not statistically significant. There was a strong negative correlation between Multilest score and advanced disease (R= -0.7 13<0.001). The incidence of mboreulosis in the population which we studied is approximately 5% in tuberculin negative and tuberculin positive individuals; this has grave implications for Irish health resources.",

Could two cities so similar in population and characteristics as Dublin and Liverpool be so different in the context of HIV disease? A 2-week locum for a Merseyside Genito-Urinary Medicine (GUM) Consultant in St. James's Hospital in Dublin was the method of investigation.Over 700 HIV positive patients had attended St. James's GUM department and approximately 550 of these were drug related infections either through intravenous drug use and/or sexual transmission to partier. In comparison, there were 18 HIV positive drug addicts out of a total of 192 infections recorded in Mersey Region. The comparison in services -GUM, substance abuse, outreach and needle exchange was equally disparate.In conclusion, despite the obvious dedication of the few dealing with so many, the number of infections continues to rise. As the tide of asymptomatie HIV diseaseprogresses inexorably towards full blown AIDS, the city's health services are facing a disaster. Could Dublin in 1992 become the \"European City of (HIV) Culture\"? inconclusive test results for antibody to hepatitis C. HCV is a single-stranded RNA flavilike virus with a lipid envelope, 50-60 rim, diameter with a ganome of jnst under 10,000 oncleotides. The sequence amplified and detected in this study was from the highy conserved non-structural 5 region. The virus RNA was extracted from serum and precipitated: reverse transcription was performed using the downstream primer NCR2. The copy DNA (cDNA) produced was amplified by the nested technique using outer primers NCRI and NCR2 and two inner primers, NCR3 and NCR4. The c270 bp prduct was detected by ethidium bromide gel electropborsesis. 1721 sera from 13 clinical categories of patients and risk-groups for hepatitis were analysed. 24 were positive and 92 were negative. An HCV probe for confirmation of these results is presently under development. PCR provided an early and sometimes only indicator of hepatitis C infection, in others it has clarified serology results. It remains the only method to detect hepatitis C virus at present. The purpose of this study was to assess the benefit of administration of tetracycline along with quinine and cotrimoxazole in the treatment of cerebral malaria, Two hundred and fifty-four eases of cerebral malaria have been studied. The patients were divided into two groups. Group A (100 patients) was treated with intravenous quinine dihydrocboride 10 mg/kg 8 hourly in 5% dextrose in aqua along with cotrimozole (800 mg sulphamethoxazole + 160 mg trimethoprim) twice daily. Group B ( 154 cases ) w as given triple therapy including intravenous quinine and co-trimoxazole in the same dose as in group A along with paranteral tetracycline 200 mg 8 hourly. Parenteral quinine and tetracycline were continued till the patients became conscious and were able to retain oral medication. Duration of treatment ranged from 7-10 days.Fatality in group without tetracycline was 18%, whereas as in the tetracycline group it was 12.33%.We conclude that co-administratinn of tetracycline with quinine and cotrimoxazol has a significant effect in lowering fatality of cerebral malaria. We used the guinea pig as an experimental model to investigate the pathogenicity of mycobecterium tuberculosis. Sputum samples were injected subcutaneusly into guinea pigs and after eight weeks the animals were killed and an autopsy performed, The likelihood of the sputum samples producing tuberculosis in the guinea pig was related to culture positivity rather than to duration of chemotherapy. This study does not support the belief 124 Inaugural National Scientific Medical Meeting that a change in pathogenicity occurs during treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. S almonell a is a common enteric pathogen, worldwide. Throughout tile 1980's infection due to Salmonella enteritidis has dramatically increased. Eight hundred and sixty Salmonella s!0p. (human cases) were isolated at Cork Regional Hospital from 1986-1991. Over this 5 year period, S. enteritidis phage type 4 has emerged as the dominant serotype isolated, accounting for 63% of all Salmonella spp. isolated in 1991. The prevalence of this serotypo of Salmonella differs from the rest of the country. Data will be presented outlining the seasonal epidemiology of this organism from human and food sources, Following successful renal transplantation between 6 and 15% of recipients will develop erythrocytosis. The importance of this as a clinical problem is that these patients are at increased risk of thromboembolic events. Traditional therapies for this condition has involved repeated phlebotomy or bilateral native nephrectomy. A number of mechanisms have been proposed for this phenomena, most of whch involved abnormally high production of erythropoietin by the native kidneys. Enalapril has been shown in a number of settings to reduce circulating EPO levels and to exacerbate anaemia in dialysis patients.Nine renal transplant patients with a haematocrit of 0.51 or greater on two consecutive occasions were enrolled in a study in which existing anti-hypertensive medication was substituted with Enalapril 2.Smgs. Baseline measurements of haematoerit and serum EPO were made. Patients were followed at two weekly intervals for 6 months.Mean haematoerit fell from 0.52 to 0.45 after 8 weeks and remained at that level for the subsequent 12 weeks (p<0.05), serum EPO also fell from 61.12u/ml to 18.25u/ml (p<0.05) after 4 weeks.The mean blood pressure, serum K or serum creatinine did not change during the 6 month period of observation.It We concluded that percutarteous PD catheters provided a safe, reliable access for peritoneal dialysis and could be applied to the management of renal failure outside specialised units. Over 60% of women having hysterectomy for excessive menstrual bleeding have no uterine pathology and are diagnosed as unex p]ained or dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). Increased local fibrinolysis has been implicated in the aetiology of DUB. This study has compared tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in uterine biopsies taken at hysterectomy from 48 women with normal menstrual loss (mean MBL 42 ml, range 5 77) and 57 women with DUB (mean MBL 194 ml, range 81 -1,059). Endometrial tPA antigen levels were significantly higher in the pre-menstrual phase of the cycle in women with DUB (p <0.02) and showed a significant correlation with the degree of MBL (r = 0.78). The tPA was localised in endothelium of small uterine blood vessels by immunooytochemistry. High levels of tPA antigen were also found in menstrual fluid during the first 48 hours of menstruation in women with DUB. Treatment of 20 women with DUB (mean MBL 160 ml, range 82 360) with the fibrinolytic inhibitor, tranexamic acid, reduced blood loss by 56% (mean MBL 74 ml, range 22 -198). These results show an important relationship between uterine fibrinolytic activity and the degree of menstrual bleeding. Supported by the Health Research Board (Ireland).",
