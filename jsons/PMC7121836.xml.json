These global sequencing efforts have provided us with genetic blueprints for a myriad of organisms in all kingdoms of life. The approach to biomedical research therefore has undergone a radical and dramatic transformation in the post-genomics era. In the emerging era of genomic medicine, it is now possible to sequence completely 3 \u00d7 109 base pairs in the human genome for individual patients. We are now tasked with the annotation and description of the plethora of genomic data with regards to biological functions. Although the protein-coding genomic space (exome) is small, where protein-coding exons account for only 1% of the human genome, it represents a majority of the targets for drug development, and 85% of Mendelian diseases are caused by genetic variations in the exomic space. A protein is not merely an \u201calphabetical\u201d sequence of amino acids, but a macromolecule with three-dimensional (3D) shape and form, capable of performing specialized biological functions in the cell via dynamic interactions with other proteins, small ligands and cellular components. These functional properties depend on a protein\u2019s three-dimensional structure, and the field of structural biology is instrumental in directing research towards an understanding of protein function and disease. A large amount of resources have now been put in place, at the disposition of the broad community of non-structural biologists in biomedical research, to exploit the wealth of protein structure information.",

            "text": "As of December 2011, the Protein Structure Database (PDB) contained ~77,700 protein structures in the public domain (http://www.pdb.org). These 3D structures are experimentally derived by methods such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and electron microscopy (EM). Among them, X-ray crystallography is the dominant structure provider (Fig. 1a), contributing ~87% of total PDB entries. Since the first protein crystal structure in the 1960s (that of myoglobin [1]), the field of protein crystallography has made tremendous technological advances in all stages of the structure determination process. Examples of such development include the use of heterologous systems (e.g. bacteria, baculovirus-infected insect cells, yeast) to recombinantly express proteins in milligram quantities [2], use of fusion tags and automated chromatography platforms to purify proteins, use of robotics in performing nanolitre-scale crystallization experiments [3], improvement of synchrotron and in-house X-ray sources that reduces data collection time and extends resolution limits [4]; and software development to accelerate the in silico data processing steps [5]. At present high-resolution crystal structures can often be determined within days of obtaining diffraction-grade crystals.\n",

Compared to crystallography, which requires the protein in a crystalline state, solution NMR benefits from studying the protein in its native form, allowing the observation of protein conformational dynamics and flexibility [6]. NMR provides an alternative route to structure determination, especially for proteins difficult to crystallize, contributing ~11% of total PDB entries. It is also very informative in mapping ligand binding residues, by titration of the ligand onto the protein and analyzing chemical shifts in a heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum. However, solution NMR consumes a considerable amount of radioactive isotope-labelled protein sample and time in the resonance assignment. There is also a size limit for proteins amenable to solution NMR measurement (<30 kDa), although this limit will continue to be pushed back by technological improvements [7].",

For the many remaining proteins in human and other organisms, computational modeling continues to bridge the gap between known sequences and available structures. The method of comparative or homology modeling allows a structural model to be constructed for a target protein based on its similarity to one or more known structures [9], on the premise that proteins sharing similar sequences fold into similar 3D structures [10]. Today, a number of modeling programs are available (e.g. MODELLER, salilab.org/modeller), some developed as online servers where a sequence-to-structure process can be performed simply by a few clicks. Their popular usage can in part be reflected by the number of available protein models in online repositories such as SWISS-MODEL (swissmodel.expasy.org), Modbase (modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu) and Protein Model Portal (www.proteinmodelportal.org). Due to its popularity, homology modeling has played an influential role in functional annotation and drug discovery for many protein families, e.g. kinases and GPCRs (see examples in [11]).",

In general, the accuracy of homology models depends heavily on the suitability of the template, with higher sequence homology between target and template resulting in less positional errors (as measured by root-mean-square deviations, rmsd, between their corresponding main-chain atoms). In practice, sequence identity cut-offs between 40% [12] and 70% [13] have been used to produce reliable models for understanding protein function and drug discovery (at a 60% identity level rmsd is usually <1 \u00c5). Models derived from lower identity templates (<30%) often have higher main-chain and side-chain errors due to a poor quality sequence alignment with too many position gaps [14].",

Making particular impact has been the use of exome sequencing (i.e. all exons in a genome) to investigate the genetic bases of rare Mendelian disorders with low and sporadic incidence in the population [17]. Its success stems partly from not being technically limited by small patient sample size, a major hurdle with conventional methods of disease gene discovery such as linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping. Today, exome sequencing has led to the discovery of new pathogenic variants and candidate genes for a number of genetic disorders (e.g. Miller syndrome [18], Freeman\u2013Sheldon syndrome [19], Kabuki syndrome [20]), and has also offered opportunities to study complex polygenic diseases (e.g. diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s and heart disease) where susceptibility is affected by multiple genes with complex inheritance patterns.",

An increasing emphasis is now placed on the effects of these variations on health and disease, although sieving through this huge volume of variant data is a laborious task. Most genetic variations occur at the single nucleotide level, represented as either single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) if they have an incidence of >1% in the genome [21], or as rare variants with <1% occurrence. Rare variants, like SNPs, can be pathogenic (i.e. disease linked; often termed conveniently as mutations) or benign (i.e. not disease linked). Of particular importance to disease diagnostics are those SNPs and rare variants that lead to amino acid substitutions (missense variants) for two reasons. First, the contribution of missense variations to disease is much higher than the summation of all other variant types (e.g. frameshifts, insertions, deletions, splicing, nonsense), with 60\u201375% of Mendelian disorders caused by amino acid substitutions [22, 23]. Second, while the consequences of most nonsense, frameshifts and insertions/deletions are self-evident (e.g. resulting in truncated proteins), the effects of missense variations on protein function and stability are more subtle and difficult to predict. Structural information at the protein level is therefore needed to understand fully their molecular effects.",

            "text": "Following the identification of genetic variants, the next indispensable step is to discriminate between pathogenic and benign variations. The sheer volume of genomic data, however, makes it too time-consuming and expensive to characterize every missense variant experimentally. To this end, numerous bioinformatics methods have been developed over the past decade to predict their molecular effects, and thus help prioritize a set of variants to be studied functionally. A number of excellent reviews on the available computational tools have been published recently ([24\u201326] and references therein for programs described below). Many prediction tools are implemented as online servers, taking an input sequence, and applying various algorithms to sort and score mutations by their pathogenicity. Structure-based algorithms, which identify a structural match to the input sequence and analyze the contributions of the variant amino acid to protein structural properties such as electrostatics, inter-residue contacts, and steric effects [27], are increasingly incorporated into prediction servers. They serve as complementary approaches to the sequence-comparison programs (e.g. SIFT, Panther and PhD-SNP) that are based on the premise that disease-causing mutations are generally concentrated at conserved amino acids with critical roles in protein structure and function [28]. Nowadays, many prediction methods combine both structural information and sequence conservation to improve their prediction performance and accuracy (e.g. nsSNP Analyzer, PolyPhen-1/2, SNAP, SNP&GO and SNPs3D). An emerging trend is to utilize multiple sets of prediction programs and servers to increase confidence in interpreting the predictions, since different algorithms use different information and have their own strengths and weaknesses. Currently there is an urgent need for standard classification as well as unbiased and statistically-relevant comparisons among the various programs, an active area of bioinformatics research [29, 30].",

            "text": "Protein structure analysis offers a promising avenue to study the molecular consequences of missense variants, by revealing the atomic environment surrounding the mutation site in silico. The most direct approach is by experimental structure determination of the protein in its mutant form if it can be expressed recombinantly and purified. This, however, often proves difficult, in part due to unstable conformations of the mutant proteins that lead to their intracellular degradation. Indeed, three-quarters of disease-associated missense mutations are postulated to destabilize the protein as their primary functional defect [12, 31]. Therefore, although thousands of proteins involved in different biological pathways and functions have been structurally characterized, only a very small proportion of these structures represent proteins inclusive of a disease associated mutation. Recent structure examples falling into this category include the ryanodine receptors RyR1 and RyR2 [32], FGFR2 tyrosine kinase domain [33] and glycogenin GYG1 [34]. As structural determination of mutant proteins often proves intractable, the alternative is to \u201cmodel\u201d the missense variation onto the wild-type structural environment, by fitting the new amino acid side-chain into the substitution site. The modeled amino acid is inspected visually using molecular graphics software, such as PyMOL (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.), Swiss-PDB viewer (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Basel) and ICM (Molsoft, La Jolla), with particular attention paid to identifying the most acceptable side-chain conformation, from a library of allowed side-chain rotamers, that results in minimal steric clashes. This structure model is then subjected to refinement and energy minimization to yield an overall stabilized conformation.",

These include possible changes in secondary structure elements, solvent accessibility, packing of neighbouring atoms and inter-atomic/inter-protein contacts, many of which can be examined using online tools ([24] and references therein). The in silico observations allow hypotheses about the molecular nature of the mutational defects to be made, and subsequently tested using a variety of biophysical and biochemical assay methods. Oligomeric state of the protein, for example, may be assessed by native gel electrophoresis, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), analytical ultracentrifugation, or dynamic light scattering [35, 36]. Secondary and tertiary structure contents may be assessed by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) [37]. Protein unfolding may be monitored by chemical or thermal denaturing detected with far-UV CD or fluorescence [38]. Functional interactions with protein partners can be determined using co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot and SEC [39]; thermodynamics of protein binding to ligand or peptide can be determined via isothermal calorimetry (ITC) or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [40]. Enzymatic catalysis and Michaelis\u2013Menton kinetics can be measured if an assay specific to the protein of interest is available [33, 41]. The above list is non-exhaustive, as there are many options to examine every aspect of a protein\u2019s functional properties in the laboratory. Regardless of the approach(es) chosen, however, it is important to compare the results obtained with the mutant protein against that of wild-type before interpretations are made. It is also important to complement in vitro observations with in vivo studies to comprehend fully the physiological consequences, for example by introducing the variants into the relevant cell lines or genetically engineered animal models.",

A classic example of a misfolding disease is phenylketonuria (PKU; OMIM 261600) caused by destabilizing mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PKU is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism (incidence of ~1 in 15,000) with more than 500 deleterious mutations reported, 60% of which are missense mutations scattered across the polypeptide [44]. The majority of mutations result in enzyme forms with reduced stability and a propensity to aggregate, resulting in protein degradation and turnover [45]. To understand how these mutations lead to a misfolded state, the available crystal structures have served as excellent tools to scrutinize the atomic environment of the missense mutation sites [46, 47] and to correlate between genotypes and phenotypes [48\u201350].",

(1) Mutation of a large buried residue to a small one will create an unfavourable solvent cavity within the core, with larger cavities resulting in greater destabilization [51]. In PAH, mutations of buried phenylalanines (F39L, F55L, F372L), valines (V177A, V190A, V245A) and leucines (L255V, L348V) to smaller residues are commonly found (Fig. 2a). (2) The reverse of the above is also true. Mutations of small residues to large ones require the protein to accommodate bulky side-chains by disturbing the surrounding packing and secondary structure arrangements. Examples in PAH include a number of alanine-to-valine substitutions (A47V, A246V, A259V, A403V) (Fig. 2b). (3) Mutations of non-polar residues within a hydrophobic environment to polar residues may also destabilize a protein because of the thermodynamic penalties incurred on the unbonded polar group. These include mutations of isoleucine to serine (I94S) or threonine (I164T, I174T) or mutations of leucine to serine (L48S, L255S) (Fig. 2c). (4) Finally, mutations of polar and charged side-chains to hydrophobic ones may remove important stabilizing contacts (e.g. electrostatic or hydrogen-bonding interactions). This is especially true of arginines, such as Arg241 (R241C, R241H) and Arg252 (R252G, R252Q, R252W) in PAH (Fig. 2d).\n",

Hot spot mapping can also help generate new conclusions about protein functions and evolutionary mechanisms such as mutability and selection pressure of different mutations by illustrating which regions of a protein can tolerate amino acid variations and which regions are intolerant. A classic example of hot spot identification is with the most commonly mutated cancer gene, TP53 (p53). In p53, an overwhelming majority of its somatic missense mutations are clustered into a loop-sheet-helix region of the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 4a) [57].

Sect. 2.2.2) that lead to skeletal muscle disorders are concentrated in a highly basic loop (Fig. 4b) and have been found not to affect protein stability, but rather to disrupt the protein\u2013protein or domain\u2013domain interface [32, 59]. In another example, 15 missense mutation sites on dyskerin, the catalytic subunit of the Box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein particles, have been identified to cause a bone marrow failure called X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (OMIM 305000). The recently determined structure of the yeast homologue Cbf5 reveals that these mutations are all located in a 32-residue N-terminal extension (Fig. 4c) that forms an additional layer to the well-characterized RNA-binding PUA fold, a structural feature not found in archaea, and may function in protein\u2013protein binding [60]. Within our group, we have mapped 55 known missense mutations causing fumarate hydratase deficiency (OMIM 606812) onto its human protein structure [61] and identified two hot spot regions, one clustering around the active site and the other affecting intra- and inter-subunit interactions. To aid further investigation by interested doctors/researchers, the online version of this article is accompanied with a web-based molecular viewer, allowing the reader to navigate the hot spot regions and each individual mutation along the protein landscape, in an interactive manner [62].",

They observed that: (1) neutral mutations/polymorphisms, those that did not tend to cause disease, generally clustered in the C-terminal regions of the catalytic core, a region thought to have a basic structural role; (2) germline disease causing mutations, which cause metabolic disorders or loss-of-function developmental disorders, tended to cluster in the catalytic core in sites involved in regulation and substrate binding, as well as in protein\u2013protein and allosteric interactions; (3) cancer causing somatic mutations were concentrated around the ATP binding and catalytic residues, directly influencing catalysis and resulting in the activation of oncogenes or deactivation of tumour suppressors.",

These large-scale studies have generally arrived at the conclusion that pathogenic variants are more likely located in solvent-buried core regions, conserved residue positions, residues that contribute hydrogen bonds and those that alter more dramatically the physico-chemical properties of amino acids [64, 65]. Khan et al. [66] also looked at the distribution and frequency of pathogenic variations and found that arginine and glycine are the most mutated residue types, while overall mutability (i.e. the likelihood of being introduced in missense variations) is highest for cysteine and tryptophan. Using similar approaches, Hurst et al. [65] found that mutations of glycine, cysteine and tryptophan were more likely to be pathogenic than others, confirming results from previous small-scale studies. They also provided online access to their large database of structurally-mapped missense variations (www.bioinf.org.uk/saap/db). Taken together, these proteome-wide structure-based mutation analyses will continue to help us formulate better rules for our prediction of whether an uncharacterized amino acid variation will be pathogenic or not, thereby improving disease diagnostics in the future.",

This has made a fundamental impact in the direction of biomedical research in steering towards a more target-centric approach to bridge this gap.

In this process, the protein structure of interest is determined in complexes with lead compounds identified from a high throughput screening (HTS) campaign, accomplished either by co-crystallizing the protein solution pre-incubated with the lead molecule, or by soaking pre-formed crystals of the apo protein with the ligand solution. The determined structure of the protein\u2013ligand complex reveals the modes of interaction between the protein and ligand at the atomic level, e.g. short-range interactions such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic contacts, the distances between the various interacting groups and atoms, and the presence of water molecules at the protein\u2013ligand interaction site.

The overall objectives are to provide a structure coverage of the \u201cprotein universe\u201d [87], to help define protein functions that cannot be predicted from sequences alone [88], and to facilitate the discovery, as well as selection, of genomic targets for drug therapy [89]. A number of large-scale SG efforts have emerged over the past 10 years, including RIKEN in Japan (www.riken.co.jp), Structure Proteomics in Europe (SPINE, www.spineurope.org), the Structural Genomics Consortium based in UK, Sweden and Canada (SGC, www.thesgc.com), as well as the Protein Structure Initiative in USA (PSI; www.nigms.nih.gov/psi). While sharing similar high-throughput methodologies and open access policy to their data, these SG initiatives differ in their scope and criteria for their target selection. A number of SG initiatives (e.g. PSI, RIKEN) aim to explore the novel protein folds that cannot be predicted from sequence [90], and subsequently leverage structure completeness of a genome by homology modeling of the remaining homologous proteins. Other SG programs take a biology-driven avenue, placing the emphasis more on medical relevance. For example, the Tuberculosis Structural Genomics Consortium [91] adopts an organism-based approach focusing on the obligate human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To date nearly 10% of all proteins from the pathogen have been structurally characterized [92], which unravel a number of previously unannotated proteins as potential anti-tuberculosis targets. The human proteome-focused SGC studies protein families with therapeutic importance such as kinases, phosphatases and metabolic enzymes [93, 94]. These studies reveal structure\u2013function relationships between family members with regards to active site and substrate specificity (Fig. 6a), and emphasize their application to develop member/family-specific chemical probes and inhibitors [95].",

This pocket should harbour amino acid side-chains that contribute to hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Based on these concepts, a number of pocket identification software have been developed to detect binding sites on the protein structure, adopting two general approaches (see [96] and references therein). The geometry-based methods (e.g. SURFNET, LIGSITE) look for geometrically-complex regions on the protein as natural binding sites tend to be concave surface invaginations. The probe/energy-based methods (e.g. GRID, AutoLigand, ICM) calculate the interaction energy between a probe molecule and protein at different point locations to define regions with favourable interaction energies.",

For example, delineating residues involved at the ligand binding site can stimulate site-directed mutagenesis experiments to probe their catalytic or regulatory roles. Structural characterization of binding sites also reveals the ligand-induced conformational changes on the protein target, which can range from small side-chain adjustment to whole-domain rearrangement [97]. Binding pockets are therefore not static sites as revealed in a structural snapshot, but dynamic regions important for the protein function. The conformational plasticity of the ligand binding sites needs to be addressed during structural analysis and drug design.",

This likelihood prediction of drug binding (\u201cdruggability\u201d) is crucial to target selection in drug discovery, with the hope of screening out unlikely candidates at an early stage. The emerging concept of protein druggability [98] is an extension to the \u201cdrug-likeness\u201d rule-of-five for small molecules that attributes good oral bioavailability of drug compounds to certain favourable physico-chemical parameters [99]. Research groups are developing tools to predict druggability and quantify it in a \u201cdruggability index\u201d using different structure-based metrics. Some correlate druggability with hit rates obtained from NMR screening of small fragments [100], whereas others base their predictions on binding affinity calculations [101] or on comparison of binding sites between different proteins/families that bind the same ligand to identify hot spot residues [102]. Druggability indices are especially useful in identifying non-native small molecule binding sites such as between protein\u2013protein interaction surfaces [103].",

This de novo approach of drug design is not constrained by the known chemical structures from existing compounds, opening up the possibility of developing novel chemotypes [114]. The most common strategy is receptor/target-based de novo design, using a priori structural information of the target protein and its binding pocket. In this strategy, small building blocks (known as seeds or fragments) are positioned onto key interaction regions within the pocket, either by computational docking (as in Sect. 3.5.1), or recently by experimental methods such as crystallography and NMR (see Sect. 3.5.3). Each fragment can then be extended towards the neighbouring available space to build a lead compound that matches the binding pocket sterically and electrostatically (\u201cgrowing\u201d approach). Alternatively, multiple fragments bound independently at different but proximal regions of the pocket can be assembled into a lead compound using linker scaffolds (\u201clinking\u201d approach). A number of de novo drug design projects have yielded potential compound hits. For example, Heikkila et al. [115] exploited a species-specific hydrophobic ligand pocket on the Plasmodium falciparum DHODH protein to design potent parasite-specific compounds with an IC50 value of 43 \u03bcM. Ni et al. [116] developed inhibitors for the peptidylprolylisomerase cyclophilin A with IC50 values of 31.6 nM, with potentials as immunosuppressive agents. An important caveat of de novo design is that it often generates complex ligands with poor synthetic accessibility and pharmacokinetic properties. This is being addressed by software development to place emphasis on generating drug-like, synthetically-possible compounds.",

Its premise is to screen experimentally hundreds to thousands of small compounds (usually between 100\u2013300 Da in size) in order to identify low-affinity fragments (K\nd in high \u03bcM range) that bind to different regions of the binding pocket, as a starting point for hit optimization. The subsequent optimization of fragment hits into a single hit compound can be rationalized, as in the de novo method, by the \u201cgrowing\u201d and \u201clinking\u201d processes. The concept of starting with small fragments is an appealing alternative to the conventional HTS attempts, with a number of merits. Fragments with their relatively small sizes and low complexity have been shown to provide higher hit rates than larger drug-like compounds from conventional screens [118], and can be optimized more efficiently. Fragments also allow a broader, more efficient sampling of the chemical space using a much smaller set of compounds (e.g. 100 fragments are equivalent to a 1,000,000 combinatory library) [114].",

With inherently higher hit rates and the likelihood of multiple binding modes for a fragment hit, it is necessary to have its binding mode characterized from crystallography or NMR to allow hit-to-lead compound design. In particular, crystallography with its low-cost, high-throughput implementation is well attuned to fragment-based screening, allowing fast structure determination of protein-fragment complexes (Fig. 6d). A recent survey showed that 15 selective and potent inhibitors generated from fragment-based screening entered the phase I or II clinical trials. Examples include inhibitors for matrix metalloproteinase [121], aurora kinase [122], cyclin-dependent kinase 2 [123] and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [124].

A mechanistic understanding of these biological processes therefore requires an examination of the protein complexes at the molecular level. Experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR and EM are now being used to complement biochemical and biophysical methods such as yeast two-hybrid, immuno-precipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, to understand these interactions better. However, complex structure determination remains challenging as compared to its single protein counterpart, and often requires systematic mapping and delineation of the interacting region to obtain co-purified and co-crystallized complexes [126, 127]. This substantial investment in time and effort is reflected by the number of protein complex structures in the PDB being only one-sixth of single protein structures. In the absence of co-crystal structures, in silico methods serve as a promising alternative to generate complex structure models by protein\u2013protein docking and homology modeling, and will continue to attract considerable attention and research due to their comparative ease of use [128]. The identification of druggable protein\u2013protein interactions that participate in diseases also represents an exciting avenue in drug discovery. Targeting a protein\u2013protein interface for small molecule modulation is often considered less tractable than conventional single protein targets, due to the large interacting surface and less pocket-like features. Nevertheless, over the years a number of protein\u2013protein interaction inhibitors have been developed, assisted by available structural information of both protein\u2013protein complexes and of individual proteins (e.g. interaction partners of interleukin IL-2, B-cell lymphoma 2 Bcl-XL and human papilloma virus transcription factor E2; [129] and references therein), and some are now entering clinical trials.",

Particularly in mind are the integral membrane proteins, such as the family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) that are predicted targets for ~30\u201350% of marketed drugs [68], and hence a major focus in pharmaceutical research. However, due to intrinsic difficulties with membrane protein crystallization, understanding GPCR structure and function has largely been achieved by homology modeling approaches. Recent structural breakthroughs, e.g. in the use of heterologous expression systems and in engineering mutations to stabilize proteins for crystallization [130], have brought the current number of available GPCR structures to six, an important increase, yet still in stark contrast to the total number of GPCRs predicted in the human genome (>900). Nevertheless, the structure determination over the past few years of a few highly-relevant GPCR drug targets (e.g. \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenergic receptors [85, 131], A2A adenosine receptor [132], chemokine receptor CXCR4 [133] and dopamine D3 receptor [134]) has provided hope for structure-based methods to be applied routinely in GPCR drug discovery. These new structures offer promising opportunities for in silico compound screening and docking, and provide a diversity of available templates for homology modeling which, until the day that routine membrane protein crystallization has arrived, will continue to play a key role in leveraging structural coverage for this protein family.",

Sect. 2.3.1) and lysosomal storage disorders [135]. PCT involves the use of small molecules, often active site inhibitors or substrate mimics of the native protein, to stabilize mutant enzymes suffering from folding and trafficking defects. A great deal of ground work and proof-of-principle studies has incorporated structural information in order to establish the molecular basis of disease mutations and to identify those chaperone-responsive mutations with potential for PCT. To this end, a small-molecule screening effort to identify stabilizing therapeutic agents to treat PKU has already yielded two promising compounds for PAH stabilization [136]. Recently, crystal structures for a number of lysosomal hydrolases (e.g. \u03b2-hexosaminidase B [137] and acid \u03b2-glucosidase [138]) have been determined in complexes with pharmacological chaperones identified from chemical screening, to provide atomic insights into their modes of stabilization. The structure determination itself of these lysosomal enzymes is no small feat due to their heavily-glycosylated nature. The stage is now set for a systematic, structure-assisted approach in developing the next generation of chaperone compounds into clinical applications. The current work additionally reveals the potential of PCT as a general strategy to treat a wide range of rare genetic diseases, many of which are being unraveled by the year, and illustrates how structural biology has suitably positioned itself within the translational approach from bench to clinic.",
