Several ECoV outbreaks were recently reported in the United States (Pusterla et al., 2013) and Japan (Narita et al., 2011, Oue et al., 2011, Oue et al., 2013). Major clinical findings during these outbreaks included fever, anorexia, lethargy, leukopenia and diarrhea. ECoV was detected in patient fecal samples from the United States and Japan, and was also detected in a respiratory sample from Europe (Miszczak et al., 2014). An ECoV experimental challenge study showed that the virus could be detected in fecal samples and nasal swabs (Nemoto et al., 2014).",

Molecular methods, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays (Oue et al., 2011) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays (Pusterla et al., 2013, Miszczak et al., 2014) have been used to detect ECoV and yield a result within hours. However, these molecular diagnostic tests require expensive specialized equipment, which is a significant barrier to their introduction in laboratories with limited resources.",

The RT-LAMP assay can be generally completed within 60 min under isothermal conditions (60\u201365 \u00b0C), and results can be analyzed by eye, based on the turbidity or fluorescence of the reaction mixture (Mori et al., 2001, Tomita et al., 2008). The RT-LAMP assay does not require expensive equipment or time-consuming post-reaction work such as gel electrophoresis. These advantages of the RT-LAMP assay might allow its widespread use for the diagnosis of field ECoV infections. In this study, an RT-LAMP assay was developed for the specific detection of ECoV.",

Digested products of expected lengths were observed using 2.2% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis (FlashGel System for DNA; Lonza Rockland) (Fig. 1\n). In addition, RT-LAMP assays were performed on samples containing equine viral and bacterial pathogens other than ECoV including equine rotavirus (RVA/Horse-tc/JPN/HO-5/1982/G3P[12], RVA/Horse-tc/JPN/No.1/2010/G3P[12] and RVA/Horse-tc/JPN/No.50/2010/G14P[12]), equine influenza virus (A/equine/Ibaraki/1/07), equine herpesvirus 1 (01c8, 05c10, and 07c1), equine herpesvirus 2 (08c3), equine herpesvirus 4 (02c21, 04c13 and 06c33), equine adenovirus 1 (05c3), equine rhinitis A virus (NM11), Getah virus (MI-110), Bacteroides fragilis (amaero-9), Clostridium perfringens (amaero-38), Clostridium difficile (amaero-125), Enterococcus spp. (Enterococcus spp-1), Escherichia coli (Entero-21), Salmonella Typhimurium (ST-1), Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (W60 and 122), Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (CF32 and Hidaka 95/2), and Rhodococcus equi (R.equi-6 and ATCC 33701). In addition, 70 nasal swabs were obtained from thoroughbred racehorses (2\u20136 years old) with fever (\u226538.5 \u00b0C) between January and December 2013. These racehorses were stabled at the Miho Training Center (Ibaraki Prefecture), where an ECoV has yet to be reported. Nasal swabs were suspended in a medium as described previously (Nemoto et al., 2014). Viral RNA and DNA were extracted from nasal swabs, and viruses isolated with a MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Bacterial DNA was extracted with an InstaGene Matrix nucleic acid purification kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The RT-LAMP assay did not amplify any products from the additional viral and bacterial pathogens examined. All 70 nasal swabs collected from thoroughbred racehorses with fever were negative according to the RT-LAMP, RT-PCR and qRT-PCR assays. These results indicate that the RT-LAMP assay does not cross-react with intestinal and intranasal pathogens other than ECoV and therefore, is highly specific for ECoV.",

NC99 was first isolated from a foal with diarrhea in the United States (Guy et al., 2000). Assays were performed twice with quadruplicate samples of artificial ECoV RNA that were serially diluted 10-fold. The detection limits of each assay, where 50% of the diluted samples were positive, were calculated using the Reed and Muench method (1938). The 50% detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was compared with those for the RT-PCR and qRT-PCR assays using artificial ECoV RNA (Table 2\n). The 50% detection limits of the RT-LAMP, RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR assays were 101.8, 103.5 and 101.2\n copies/reaction, respectively. The RT-LAMP assay was 50-fold more sensitive than the RT-PCR assay; however, the qRT-PCR assay was 4-fold more sensitive than the RT-LAMP assay.",

The RT-LAMP, RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR assays were positive for ECoV in 59, 30 and 65 fecal samples, respectively (Table 3, Table 4\n). The RT-LAMP assay detected ECoV in 29 additional samples that were negative by RT-PCR assay. In contrast, the qRT-PCR assay detected ECoV in 6 additional samples that were negative by RT-LAMP assay. Results from clinical samples agreed with those when artificial ECoV RNA was used. These results indicated that the RT-LAMP assay was more sensitive than RT-PCR but less sensitive than qRT-PCR.",

Therefore, the RT-LAMP assay may fail to detect variations in ECoV sequences that emerge in the future, indicating RT-LAMP primers must be updated in the future. RT-LAMP reactions can be performed at an isothermal temperature (60 \u00b0C) within 40 min, and the results can be evaluated easily with the naked eye after adding calcein (Nemoto et al., 2010). Although the RT-LAMP assay is less sensitive than established qRT-PCR assays, its advantage is that it can be completed quickly without specialist equipment. In conclusion, the RT-LAMP assay designed in this study should be suitable for large-scale surveillance and the diagnosis of ECoV infection in laboratories with limited resources.",
