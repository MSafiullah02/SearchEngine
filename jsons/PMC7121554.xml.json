Such issues have vast implications on the desirability of compact, high-rise high-dense built forms. Yet, the environmental quality and social acceptance of these forms remain barely studied. This chapter reviews some of the critical environmental implications posed by the closely packed high-rise building and high urban densities. High-rise buildings of Hong Kong1 are explored to discuss the pressing challenges of poor air quality, ventilation, daylight, lack of open space and noise pollution. Both quantitative and qualitative appraisals of Hong Kong residents living in high-rise buildings are used to analyse the environmental challenges. Recommendations for improvements using current practices in Hong Kong and possible solutions for the future are also discussed.",

Special attention is given to how the physical form of a city changes over time and how different cities can be compared with each other. Related to the physical form, urban morphology would also study social forms, which are expressed in the physical layout of a city, and conversely, how physical form produces or reproduces various social forms.",

In a compact city the reduction in car ownership, vehicular trips and increase of pedestrian and transit use alleviate the environmental consequences associated with the automobile. Compact city has many advantages such as conservation of countryside, reduced need to travel by car and thereby reduction in fuel and pollution, support for public transport, walking and cycling, better access to services, more efficient utility and infrastructure provisions, and revitalization and regeneration of urban areas (Burton, 2000). In contrast to compact city, dispersed cities suffer from inefficient transport management and long commuting trips, which lead to a high dependency on automobile high energy consumption and pollution (Newman & Kenworthy, 1992).",

Greater intensification has implications on urban green space. Even though a valuable contributor to urban quality, urban greenery provision is often reduced under pressure from other land use development.

In comparison with urban sprawl, the compact city is a dominant model for sustainability (Jenks, 2000). Yet, evidence on the impact of higher and lower densities on sustainability, the impact of centralized decentralized city form on sustainability are lacking. Review of some city forms indicates both advantages as well as disadvantages in sustainability. For example, forms that reduce travel and are fuel-efficient may be harmful to the environment and have social inequities. They may be locally beneficial but not city-wise beneficial (Williams et al., 2000). The effects of urban density on the total energy demand of a city are complex and at times conflicting (Givoni, 1998). Compactness of land use patterns will bring benefits to energy distribution and transport system design, but crowded conditions may create congestion and undesirable local microclimate (Hui, 2000). The compact city challenges are mainly associated with environmental quality and social acceptability (Williams et al., 2000).",

Hong Kong is one of the Asian cities that have evolved as a compact urban form. Situated at the south-eastern tip of China, Hong Kong is ideally positioned at the centre of rapidly developing East Asia. With a total area of 1,103 km2, it covers Hong Kong Island (80.41 km2), the Kowloon peninsula just opposite (46.93 km2), and the more rural section of Hong Kong New Territories and 262 outlying islands (976.38 km2). The central part of both Hong Kong Island and Kowloon are hilly rising to a height of 3,050 m. Only 21.8% of Hong Kong land is built up, concentrating on the triangular tip of Kowloon and the coastal strip of northern Hong Kong Island.",

The density of public housing reaches at least 2,500 residents per ha, which is twice the density of the most crowded residential areas in mainland China (Xue, Manuel, & Chung, 2001). High-density in a land limited country like Hong Kong is the norm.

The concept of home-work-play gives the residents efficiency, convenience and savings in time. Tall buildings also provide a heuristic device to meet the housing demands for the increasing population. Additionally, the mixed use nature of developments creates places that are active and lively for longer duration of time, providing safe neighbourhoods and additional time for use of urban spaces for its residents. Rich, vibrant urban spaces are created within neighbourhoods. Urban intensification and compactness also provides savings in infrastructure and services, and high penetration of infrastructure and services for all residents. For example, it results in an overall reduction in energy use and traffic fumes (Wu, 2005).",

For example, it has implemented vehicle emission and fuel standards, cleaner alternatives to diesel, emission inspection and enforcements such as controlling smoky vehicles, etc. and promoting vehicle maintenance and eco-driving. In his 2006\u20132007 policy address, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong has emphasized the importance of addressing these issues in order to secure sustainable development for future generations. He has outlined some of the measures,To reduce air pollution, we have formulated the Pearl River Delta (PRD) Regional Air Quality Management Plan. This plan, prepared in partnership with the Guangdong Provincial Government, aims to achieve specific emissions reduction targets by 2010. We have now set up a 16-station air quality monitoring network in the PRD. Based on the data collected, the PRD Regional Air Quality Index is released everyday on the Internet to keep the public informed of the actual regional air quality. The data collected will also help us assess the effectiveness of our pollution reduction measures \u2026 In Hong Kong, we have imposed emission caps on power plants at Castle Peak, Black Point and Lamma Island. These emission caps will be progressively tightened to meet the 2010 emission reduction targets. (Chief Executive, 2006\u20132007).\n",

Increased use of mass transport and reduction in private car and taxi could help to reduce the air pollution levels caused by vehicular traffic. In addition to policy measures, urban design measures are suggested for improving air ventilation (Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2005; Hong Kong Planning Department, 2006b). Recent study identifies the following urban design issues as a means to a better quality and comfortable urban environment: lack of breezeways air paths; tall and bulky buildings closely packed causing undesirable wind breaks to urban fabric; uniform building heights resulting in wind skimming over the top of buildings and not being re-routed into the fabric; tight narrow streets not aligned with prevailing wind with tall buildings resulting in urban canyons; lack of urban permeability-with few open spaces, minimal gaps between buildings, excessive podium structures reducing air volumes at ground levels; large building blocks forming wind barriers; projections from buildings and obstructions on narrow streets and general lack of soft landscaping, shading and greenery as contributing to poor air ventilation and environmental quality in high-rise, compact built areas (Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2005; Hong Kong Planning Department, 2006b).",

Breezeways, roads, main streets and avenues should be aligned either parallel or 30\u00b0 to the prevailing wind directions. Open spaces must be linked and aligned to form unobstructed wind corridors with low-rise structures alongside them. Space between buildings must be maximized, especially in large sites with dense developments. The longer frontages of blocks may be aligned parallel to wind corridors, and non-built areas and setbacks may be introduced to further allow for good wind penetration. To maximise the penetration of sea breezes and land breeze water front sites may take special precautions to avoid blockages in wind paths (Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2005).",

The low age of air is also spread in larger proportions when the elevation height increases. As seen in the graphs, both low- and high-rise buildings form a wall that is oriented perpendicular to the prevailing wind patterns. This creates a barrier to the southeast winds and creates stagnant air in the leeward sides of the buildings. Ideally, these built forms must be oriented parallel to the prevailing wind direction to ensure better ventilation and cleaner air. Lower age of air and better ventilation is observed surrounding the smaller fragmented building shapes and footprints.

During the daytime, the air near the mountain surface can be heated up and higher than the free air far away at the same height due to the solar radiation. Thus the warm air moves up along the slopes. While during the night-time, as the mountain surfaces cool down, the cold breezes can be formed and flow down the slopes. The proposed new podium can enhance the air flow through the building. It can be imagined that the building region can benefit from the mountain breezes by bringing the cooled air at night-time on hot days.

Adequate provision of open space, greenery, vistas and visual corridors is a critical issue in the light of high land prices and the general lack of space between and around tall buildings. Open spaces and landscaping on podiums are design measures taken to improve resident perceptions of open spaces, views and greenery. Open spaces located close to highways, roadways, and transport nodes create poor environmental quality due to noise, dust and smoke emissions. In other words, it can be argued that even if open spaces are provided within residential blocks or outside in close proximity to homes, if its quality does not meet the demands and satisfaction of its users, such open spaces may not be efficiently utilised.",

But, people are forced to use these open spaces despite its poor environmental quality.
