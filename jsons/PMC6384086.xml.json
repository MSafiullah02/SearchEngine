Although a virus does not contain a cytoskeletal system, viruses utilize the cytoskeleton system of a host cell to complete the infection process (2, 3). Currently, numerous experiments show that the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for many stages of the viral life cycle, including binding, entry, nuclear localization, genomic transcription and reverse transcription, assembly, and export/dissemination (4\u20136). Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a highly neurovirulent virus that spreads to the central nervous system via peripheral nerves (7). Pig is the natural host of PHEV, but the virus has been adapted to replicate in mouse and mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells (N2a cells) (8). PHEV infection induces neurite damage and neuronal death, which may be the cause of neurological symptoms (9). Moreover, PHEV also utilizes the host actin-related protein CASK interacting protein 1 (Caskin1) to facilitate replication of the virus in host cells (10). Studying the mechanism of PHEV entry into the cell from the perspective of the interaction between virus infection and host actin cytoskeleton has great scientific significance for exploring pathogenesis and developing new antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "The first obstacle encountered by virus-infected cells is the cortical actin cytoskeleton, which is located below the plasma membrane and consists of a network of loosely organized fibrous actin (F-actin) (4). The dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton play an important role in the maintenance of cell morphology and in preventing the invasion of pathogens (11). This dynamic change includes the formation of various actin scaffolds of filopodia, lamellipods, and stress fibers as well as other functions, which are regulated by the activation of their upstream signaling pathways in which the small G protein family Rho GTPases plays a crucial role (12). Many pathogens, including viruses, facilitate their entry into and/or trafficking in cells by stimulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling (13). Furthermore, effective virus entry is achieved by induction of actin remodeling (14, 15). The most commonly utilized members of the Rho GTPases for viruses are the ras homolog gene family, including member A (RhoA), Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) (16). For example, RhoA and Rac1 GTPase-mediated actin cytoskeletal rearrangements during Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection are crucial for viral endocytosis (16). Cofilin is an important regulatory protein of the cytoskeletal depolymerization factor family and is widely involved in cell migration, among other processes (17). LIM kinase (LIMK) inhibits cofilin activity by phosphorylating serine residue 3 (Ser-3). LIMK can be activated by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), which is a downstream kinase of RhoA, and p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs), which are downstream kinases of Rac1 and Cdc42 (18). Integrins, a large family of transmembrane glycoproteins, play an important role in the regulation of various cellular functions. Many pathogens use integrin to regulate cytoskeletal functions to promote infection (19, 20). Activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is a key tyrosine kinase in the integrin signaling pathway, activates Rac1 and Cdc42 (21). PHEV enters N2a cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and this process leads to a rapid rearrangement of actin (22), but the role of actin rearrangement and the molecular mechanisms responsible for its action remain unclear.",

The results showed that dynamic changes in cofilin activity affected viral infection. The early biphasic kinetics of cofilin activity induced by PHEV entry were responsible for the mediation of F-actin assembly and disassembly. The PHEV-mediated early phosphorylation of cofilin involved integrin \u03b15\u03b21-FAK signaling, which triggered events of F-actin recombination and viral entry. We also showed that PAKs were downstream regulators controlling cofilin activity and cell morphogenesis. Therefore, PHEV has evolved a complex mechanism of infecting N2a cells. Collectively, our results not only reveal the mechanism of actin rearrangement induced by PHEV infection but also provide new ideas for the development of new antiviral drugs.",

Compared with inactivated virus and mock groups, we found that PHEV entry into N2a cells induced the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia or stress fibers at different times. As early as 5 min postinfection (mpi), we observed the dissolution of actin stress fibers and the appearance of filopodia and lamellipodia. However, stress fibers reappeared at 30 mpi (Fig. 1A). Simultaneously, we used ImageJ software to analyze the changes of actin semiquantitatively, which were consistent with the above-described results (Fig. 1B). The dynamic changes in F-actin caused by virus infection next were quantitatively determined by flow cytometry. F-actin showed rapid polymerization early (5 mpi) and then started depolymerization at 20 mpi (Fig. 1C).",

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and indirect immunofluorescence were used to detect the entry of PHEV. We observed that CytoD strongly disrupted actin polymerization after treatment of cells by confocal microscopy assay (Fig. 2C). Additionally, PHEV entry was impaired by the disruption of actin dynamics using CytoD and in a dose-dependent manner compared with entry in the control cells (Fig. 2A to C). Simultaneously, we also determined the growth kinetics of PHEV. Virus titer was significantly reduced after CytoD treatment (Fig. 2D). The relationship between PHEV particles and actin early in infection was further examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy, with infected cells stained using FITC-phalloidin and PHEV particles labeled with PHEV-S antibody. During the first 10 mpi, the virus primarily concentrated in the protuberances, such as filopodia; as the infection progressed, the virus particles moved along the filopodia to penetrate the membrane surface of the cell membrane, moving and distributing in the cell membrane surface (at 30 mpi); at 60 mpi, PHEV particles had almost completely entered the cytoplasm (Fig. 2E). Additionally, the kinetic curve of the virus entering the cell was determined by a fluorescence quantitative PCR method, as shown in Fig. 2F. The virus entry of the cell primarily occurred after 15 mpi. The results described above indicated that the entry of the virus is closely related to the dynamic changes of the cytoskeleton caused by the virus.",

Because PHEV invasion of cells led to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, we examined the changes in cofilin activity during the viral infection. Western blotting showed that cofilin was first inactivated and then gradually activated after 30 mpi (Fig. 3A), which closely corresponded to the dynamic changes of F-actin, and a similar trend was also found by measuring the fluorescence intensity of cofilin (p-CFL) in the inactive state and its colocalization with F-actin (Fig. 3C). PHEV infection also induced transient activation of LIMK kinase early at 5 mpi, which was then inactivated at 30 mpi (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results showed that the regulation of cofilin activity mediated the dynamic changes of actin caused by the early infection of the virus.",

Notably, all three constructs inhibited PHEV entry in a dose-dependent manner, similar to the results of inhibition of cofilin expression (Fig. 5A). Additionally, PHEV entry particles were assessed by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using an anti-PHEV-S antibody. Detection by confocal microscopy showed that the virus entry process was reduced (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the dynamic phosphorylation of cofilin for the efficient entry of PHEV was essential. Cofilin may accumulate on cortical actin and participate in F-actin assembly and disassembly, which may affect viral binding and penetration. Additionally, cofilin-specific siRNAs could dilapidate cellular stress fibers, form small protrusions on the cell surface, and fragment actin filaments into lumps (Fig. 5C). These results indicated that cofilin is required for PHEV entry into cells and the maintenance of actin cytoskeletal stability. Additional microscopic experiments showed that peripheral migration of the virus on cells mobilized cofilin, and the strict control of local activity around the cofilin cells is crucial for virus entry (18). In the absence of PHEV stimulation, cofilin/WT expression and overexpression of mutant cofilin/S3A cells were positive for the cofilin rod-shaped structure. These rod-shaped structures were composed of active cofilin. Active cofilin can chelate actin, thereby reducing the production of wrinkles. These phenomena are consistent with increased cofilin activity (18). However, PHEV infection caused the rod-shaped structures to disappear, indicating that viral infection modulated cofilin activity (Fig. 5D). These observations suggested that alteration of cofilin activity favors viral adsorption and entry into cells.",

Additionally, several studies show that the virus binds to the cell surface receptor and induces an intracellular signaling cascade that is predominantly tyrosine phosphorylated. Therefore, we first examined whether RTKs were involved in virus entry and cofilin phosphorylation. When N2a cells were pretreated with genistein, a specific inhibitor of RTKs, viral entry and cofilin phosphorylation were not significantly affected (Fig. 6A and B). Therefore, RTKs were not involved in PHEV entry and cofilin phosphorylation. Integrins belong to the family of cell adhesion molecules and are a type of transmembrane protein widely found on the surface of animal and plant cell membranes. They are important regulatory factors in physiological activities such as cell migration and proliferation. Integrins consist of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits and exist as heterodimers on the cell surface (24). Integrin \u03b15\u03b21 is a heterodimer composed of an \u03b15 subunit and \u03b21 subunit. Integrin is an important receptor of fibronectin (FN) in the matrix and primarily mediates the interaction of cells with extracellular matrix proteins and plays an important role in cell motility, migration, and neural cell remodeling (25, 26). Therefore, we treated cells with the integrin \u03b15\u03b21 inhibitor ATN-161 to determine whether integrin \u03b15\u03b21 participated in PHEV entry into cells and cofilin phosphorylation. The results showed that viral entry and cofilin phosphorylation were significantly affected (Fig. 6C and D).",

Within 5 min, FAK was transiently activated when PHEV was added to the cells. FAK then was slowly inactivated and was almost completely inactivated in 20 min (Fig. 8A). This phenomenon was consistent with the cofilin phosphorylation period. These experiments suggested that FAK is associated with the process of PHEV entry into the cell and PHEV-induced early cofilin phosphorylation. To confirm this hypothesis, we treated cells with FAK-specific inhibitor PF-573228. The results showed that viral entry was significantly inhibited, and cofilin phosphorylation decreased in a concentration-dependent manner when the cells were inhibitor treated (Fig. 8B and C). Simultaneously, ATN-161 also affected FAK activation in PHEV infection early (Fig. 8D), which demonstrated the cellular processes of PHEV entry and PHEV-induced early cofilin phosphorylation involved FAK.",

To verify which pathway is involved in PHEV-induced early cofilin phosphorylation, we performed the following experiments. The activation of Src in the early stage of PHEV infection was detected by Western blotting. The results showed that Src expression did not change and also was not activated in the early stages of PHEV infection (Fig. 8E). Additionally, pretreatment of N2a cells with PP2 (a specific inhibitor of Src family kinases) did not affect PHEV infection (Fig. 8F to G).

Rho family small G proteins are key proteins that regulate cell morphology and motility migration. These proteins regulate cell motility and cell morphology by controlling actin contraction and microtubule distribution (29). The three subfamilies RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 regulate cell shape and migration through coordination (30). RhoA is responsible for the formation of stress fibers, Rac1 induces membrane ruffles or lamellipodia, and Cdc42 regulates the formation of protrusive filopodia (12). The FAK pathway can regulate cofilin phosphorylation by activating either Rac1 or Cdc42 (1). To study the role of Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases early in the entry process of PHEV and PHEV-induced cofilin phosphorylation, we pretreated cells with Rac1 or Cdc42 GTPase inhibitors to determine whether they were upstream regulators of cofilin. Racl GTPase inhibitor EHoP-016 and Cdc42 GTPase inhibitor ML-141 both inhibited viral entry and affected cofilin phosphorylation during the early stages of PHEV infection (Fig. 9A to D).",

To further examine the involvement of Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases in PHEV-induced cofilin phosphorylation, we tested the activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the early stages of PHEV infection. According to the PAK1 protein p21 binding domain (PBD) with GTP-Rac1 and GTP-Cdc42 interaction principle (31), we detected the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown method. The PBD of PAK1 protein was constructed on a vector containing GST and expressed as a fusion protein (Fig. 9E). Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) significantly activated intracellular Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively (28, 32). The cells were treated with PDGF and EGF to test the specificity of the established method. The results showed that GST-PBD interacted with intracellularly activated Rac1 and Cdc42 and that this interaction was highly specific compared with that of the control group (Fig. 9F). The above-described method was used to detect the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 at different time points after PHEV stimulation. As shown in Fig. 9G, Rac1 and Cdc42 were rapidly activated and slowly inactivated 20 min after viral infection, consistent with the dynamic changes of actins and the dynamic phosphorylation of cofilin. We also examined the effect of inhibitors of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and FAK on Rac1 and Cdc42 activity. Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were detected after cells were treated with inhibitors and inoculated with PHEV for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 9H, both integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and FAK inhibitors affected Rac1 and Cdc42 activity induced by PHEV infection. The above-described results suggested that Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases, as integrin \u03b15\u03b21-FAK downstream kinases, regulate cofilin phosphorylation during the early phase of PHEV infection.",

Partly infected piglets have diarrhea symptoms (34\u201336). Currently, no effective prevention or treatment measures exist for this disease (37), which, when an outbreak occurs, causes enormous economic losses to the pig industry. Although the pathogenesis of PHEV and mechanisms of neural damage have been gradually characterized, very little research has been conducted on the pathways of virus entry into the cell. In this experiment, for the first time the cellular mechanism of PHEV cell entry was studied from the perspective of the actin cytoskeleton. The pattern is shown in Fig. 11. We determined that cofilin is a key factor required for PHEV infection. PHEV entry required a two-stage process of rapid polymerization and depolymerization of actin, and PHEV triggered bidirectional regulation of cofilin protein activity. Viral binding induced phosphorylation of cofilin by integrin \u03b15\u03b21-FAK-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK signaling for actin polymerization and efficient entry. Subsequent viral penetration activated cofilin, resulting in the fragmentation of existing actin filaments to promote viral trafficking. These findings suggested that PHEV promotes viral entry by regulating cofilin activity and inducing dynamic actin polymerization and depolymerization.",

Actin filaments are composed of a polymer formed by G-actin monomers, namely, F-actin, and are primarily located in the cortical region below the cell membrane (42). Actin filaments play an important role in the maintenance of cell morphology and preventing the invasion of pathogens (11). A virus binds to its corresponding receptor on the extracellular matrix (ECM), and then the virus must migrate to sites that favor its particular entry pattern, either by direct plasma membrane fusion or by macrophage generation, phagocytosis, and various forms of clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent endocytosis (4). During this process, viruses often encounter actin rearrangement processes, such as filopodia and microvilli, and use these structures to efficiently move to the cell membrane (4). The rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton induced by different types of viruses is different. For example, murine leukemia virus (MLV) must bind to receptors via the action of actin to form a virus-receptor complex and move to a suitable location for the virus to complete endocytosis (43). Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) requires the simultaneous polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments to complete its binding to host cells (44). Poliovirus also utilizes the actin- and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways into the cell (45). All of these results indicate that viruses utilize the complexity and diversity of host cell actin. In our previous research, PHEV entered neural cells primarily through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and for this process to be completed, an acidic environment with the participation of various proteins was required, including proteins such as mobilized proteins, cholesterol, and Eps15. Simultaneously, actin cytoskeleton integrity is positively correlated with virus endocytosis during PHEV invasion (22), but the role and mechanism of the actin cytoskeleton in this process are not clear. In this study, we observed actin rearrangements with the formation of cellular filopodia and lamellipodia and the solubilization of actin stress fibers and their repositioning around the cell membrane in the early stages of PHEV infection. Additionally, the virus moves along the filopodia to the cell membrane. Cofilin is involved in neurodegenerative diseases as one of the actin filament regulatory factors (18). Cofilin activity is also involved in virus-mediated actin remodeling (2). In the early stages of PHEV infection, we also found that cofilin dynamic phosphorylation was the key to the virus effectively entering cells. The dynamic regulation of cofilin activity mediates the formation of cellular processes caused by viruses, and the critical control of local cofilin activity is crucial for actin-dependent processes such as receptor aggregation and intracellular migration.",

            "text": "Many regulatory mechanisms that affect the activity of cofilin in host cells are caused by viral infection, with effects on RTKs, integrins, and other pathways. RTKs can convert extracellular signals into intracellular signals and regulate the structure of the actin cytoskeleton (46). Integrins are heterodimers formed by the different pairings of 18 \u03b1 and 8 \u03b2 subunits. Integrins provide a link between the ECM protein and the actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for the regulation of the cytoskeleton and intracellular signaling pathways. Additionally, integrins participate in the process of virus entry into cells (47). Most viruses affect the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton of host cells through RTK signaling pathways, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and HSV-1 (47). However, our results showed that PHEV affected actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and cofilin activity via the integrin \u03b15\u03b21-FAK signaling pathway. Integrin \u03b15\u03b21 not only accumulated at the PHEV attachment but also promoted the activation of FAK, which is a downstream kinase. Additionally, integrin \u03b15\u03b21 inhibitor ATN-161 blocked PHEV infection by inhibiting the downstream signaling cascade. Many viruses use integrins and related rafts to promote binding and internalization, consolidating the role of integrins in virus internalization and infection (3) and suggesting that internalization of integrins is a common mechanism by which a virus enters the cell. Notably, we also found another difference between PHEV and most other viruses in this experiment, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) (48\u201350): the Src kinase did not participate in the process of virus-induced actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and did not affect cofilin activity. Src kinase is a member of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase family and participates in a variety of signal transduction pathways in the cell (50). Under normal physiological conditions, FAK activates and then activates the Src family kinase under the action of integrin (51). FAK was activated during PHEV entry into host cells, but Src phosphorylation levels did not change. Additionally, the process of PHEV entry into the cell was not affected after treatment with Src-specific inhibitors. These results demonstrated that PHEV regulates actin cytoskeleton rearrangements using the FAK signaling pathway independent of the Src family.",

Additionally, we also demonstrated that Rac1 and Cdc42 were downstream Rho GTPases of the integrin \u03b15 \u03b21-FAK pathway, and both Rac1 and Cdc42 affected the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton by regulating the activity of cofilin through downstream PAK molecules. PAK is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase whose phosphorylation promotes the formation of actin filaments through the inactivation of cofilin; the dephosphorylation restores the interaction between cofilin molecules and actin monomers, which depolymerizes actin filaments. This regulatory process affects the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (6). Although both Rac1 and Cdc42 regulated the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement through PAK, we found that the activation time of Rac1 and Cdc42 in PHEV invasion of N2a cells was different. In the stage of virus invasion, the activation of Cdc42 was earlier than that of Rac1. Whether different activation times of Rho GTPases indicate different roles requires further exploration.",
