The MERS-designated wards in hospital A had been newly constructed in 2012 and were specially designed for highly pathogenic respiratory viral pathogens. Each negative-pressure room had an anteroom (Figure 1A ). In hospital A, 1 room was occupied by patient 1, a 69-year-old man with pneumonia who received mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on day 22 from the onset of symptoms (Figure 1B ) and whose respiratory specimens (tracheal aspirates) persistently tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR up to the time of environmental sampling. The other room in hospital A was occupied by patient 2, a 54-year-old man with pneumonia who received mechanical ventilation on day 16 from the onset of symptoms (Figure 1C ); his respiratory specimens (tracheal aspirates) also persistently tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR up to the time of environmental sampling. The MERS-designated wards in hospital B were switched to isolation wards during the MERS outbreak. The rooms lacked anterooms, had portable negative-pressure devices (Cleanroom H13, IQAir, Goldach, Switzerland), and shared a common corridor (Figure 2A ). One room was occupied by patient 3, a 74-year-old man with pneumonia who was not using any mechanical ventilator on day 19 from the onset of symptoms; his respiratory specimens (sputum samples) tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR 6 days before the time of environmental sampling. At the time of environmental sampling, on day 19, his respiratory symptoms persisted but further respiratory samples were not taken because the attending physician thought that continued positive results from his respiratory specimens would not alter any clinical decisions about management and isolation in this resource-limited hospital. The patient was bedridden and had not used the restroom (Figure 2B ). Environmental sampling of the rooms occupied by patient 1 and 2 was performed 6\u20137 hours after the daily routine cleaning, and environmental sampling of patient 3 was performed 3\u20134 hours after the daily routine cleaning.

Vero E6 (ATCC, CRL-1586) cells were incubated with the filtered samples in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Welgen, Korea) supplemented with 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a CO 2 incubator, and checked daily for cytopathic changes. Fourteen days after inoculation, culture supernatants and lysates of Vero E6 cells were harvested and used for detecting MERS-CoV by RT-PCR. The harvested cells were centrifuged for 3 minutes at 1000 rpm to remove cellular debris. The pellets were resuspended in washing buffer (0.1 M phosphate buffer) and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. After thoroughly removing washing buffer, the cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4\u00b0C overnight and photographed with a transmission electron microscope (JEOL model GEM-1400, Tokyo, Japan). The same culture supernatants were used to infect Vero cells for immunofluorescence analysis. Immunofluorescence antibody test was conducted at the tissue culture cells on 2 dpi for MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/002_05_2015 and 7 dpi for environmental samples, respectively. Anti-MERS-CoV Spike antibody was purchased from Sino Biological Inc (Beijing, China).

It has been proposed that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in the Hong Kong M Hotel was due to contaminated environmental surfaces [ 8 ], and that those in Amoy Garden in Hong Kong, in airplanes, and in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong were due to airborne transmission [ 9\u201311 ]. Roy and Milton have suggested that SARS-CoV is not transmitted by either droplet transmission or airborne transmission, but rather by a process lying somewhere between the two [ 12 ]. Given that we found that air and surrounding surfaces including accessible and inaccessible areas were all contaminated by MERS-CoV, we agree that the transmission mode of MERS-CoV differs from droplet transmission. Further studies are needed to clarify this question. ",

            "text": " There is evidence supporting aerosol transmission of MERS. Experimental aerosolization of MERS-CoV did not decrease its stability at 20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity [ 13 ], and MERS-CoV RNA was detected in an air sample from the barn of an infected camel that transmitted MERS-CoV to a patient who died [ 14 ]. In addition, a recent study demonstrated that the human lung parenchyma has abundant dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptors for MERS-CoV whereas the human nasal mucosa has few DPP4 receptors for MERS-CoV [ 15 ]. Hence, we assume that aerosol transmission of MERS-CoV is possible, and that an aerosol with a high concentration of infectious particles, and contamination of the surrounding environment, might mimic that expected of large-droplet sprays and surface contact [ 12 ]. We therefore cautiously recommend that contact tracing and infection control precautions equivalent to those involved in cases of airborne transmission are needed in hospitals where patients who are severely ill with MERS stay. It is worth noting that many environmental swab samples contained MERS-CoV despite daily cleaning and disinfection of the patients' rooms. These findings are consistent with previous studies that demonstrated survival of MERS-CoV for 2 days on plastic and steel surfaces [ 13 ], survival of SARS-CoV for 3 days on various surfaces [ 16 ], and survival of human CoV for 6 days in air [ 17 ]. Therefore, the extensive environmental contaminations and prolonged environmental presence of MERS-CoV may partially explain why MERS is easily spread in healthcare settings. In addition, our data emphasize the importance of strict adherence to infection control precautions, including hand hygiene. ",

On the other hand, a group in China conducted environmental sampling of the room of a MERS-infected patient on days 13 and 15 after symptom onset, and the swabs were negative for viral RNA [ 18 ]. Our study results partially overlap with those of the study of Bin et al [ 7 ], who performed environmental sampling of the 4 rooms of 4 MERS-infected patients between days 18 and 30 after symptom onset [ 7 ]. However, the positive rates of RT-PCR and viral culture in the previous study [ 7 ] were 20% (30/148) and 4% (6/148), respectively, whereas those in the present study were 65% (49/75) and 25% (19/75), respectively. Caution is needed when comparing the results of our study to those of the previous study [ 7 ], because ours was more focused on airborne transmission. Actually, Bin et al showed that MERS-CoV was detected by RT-PCR but not by viral culture on the entrance to air-ventilating equipment in one patient's room, and they suggested the existence of airborne virus particles. However, they did not perform air sampling. We tested air samples and swabbed surfaces such as the ventilator exit and the top of televisions, which were inaccessible, and areas remote from the patients as well as areas easily missed by daily cleaning. So, it is possible that MERS-CoV particles could have been concentrated in exhaust air grills and the corners of rooms that were not routinely disinfected. ",

The 3 patients included in the study were at similar stages of disease progression, between 16 and 22 days after symptom onset, and patients at a stage <1 week after symptom onset were not included. In addition, it would be interesting to examine the environmental contamination surrounding less severely ill patients. Second, some may question the isolation of viable virus from the surroundings of patient 3, in whom the last positive RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was in a respiratory specimen taken 6 days prior to the date of the environmental sampling. Actually, because a respiratory sample was not taken at the time of the environmental sampling, we cannot know whether the results of RT-PCR of a respiratory specimen would have been positive or not. However, in the previous study [ 7 ], the patient's room and medical equipment were positive for virus up to 5 days after the patient's last positive PCR for a respiratory specimen. We thus assume that virus can still be detected several days after negative PCR conversion of respiratory specimens. Hence, the absence of results for a respiratory specimen from patient 3 at the time of environmental sampling does not significantly affect the interpretation of our results. Finally, the experimental data indicating extensive surface and air contamination only provide some insight into the possible routes of transmission; they do not fully identify the route(s) of transmission. Further epidemiologic and experimental studies are urgently needed in this area. ",
