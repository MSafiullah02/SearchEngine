The child's mother reported tonic-clonic movements that lasted for about 15 min. The seizure-like activity resolved with one dose of lorazepam given at the emergency department of an outside hospital. At the well-child clinic visit at 9 months of age, his primary physician noticed an increase in the patient's head circumference above the 97th percentile. The child was referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, which showed a left-sided frontoparietal subdural fluid collection, approximately 12 mm in size, consistent with a subdural hematoma. Because the patient was asymptomatic without any neurologic deficit, there was no intervention. Three weeks later, a repeat MRI of the brain showed a stable appearance of the collection. The patient's mother stated that her son had recurrent fevers that started a few days after his 9-month well-child visit. The fever was initially low grade, at 100-101 \u00b0F for the first 2 weeks, then had increased to 103-104 \u00b0F during the previous 3 weeks, with minimal response to acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The mother also recalled that the infant had a small-to-moderate amount of intermittent, watery, and non-bloody diarrhea during the previous 3 weeks. This had been attributed to an antibiotic-related diarrhea associated with empiric treatment with amoxicillin. The patient was evaluated by many physicians, including in three emergency departments, and on multiple occasions for his prolonged fever. A diagnosis of viral upper respiratory infection was made twice and managed by acetaminophen. Acute otitis media was diagnosed on another occasion and managed by a course of amoxicillin. Physicians who treated the child did not feel that he required hospital admission during the 6-week illness prior to his presentation to our center.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Muayad Alali"}, {"text": "The history was complicated because it was suspected that the subdural hematoma was a result of non-accidental trauma.

The thickness of the collection had increased to approximately 30 mm compared with 14 mm 2 weeks before, and there was mass effect ( Fig. 11.1 ).

Measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) is useful in cases of suspected antibody deficiency. Measurement of immunoglobulin E (IgE) is useful in a patient with recurrent bacterial infections and dermatitis because if the level is greater than 2000 IU/mL, hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is suspected. Measurement of IgG antibody titers to tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccines is used to assess response to protein antigens, which is critical to assess the integrity of humoral immunity. The mitogen lymphocyte proliferation test is used to evaluate the integrity of T-cell responses to plant mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed mitogen (PMW), which are powerful stimulants of T cells. Lymphocyte subset analysis by flow cytometry is also an essential tool in the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies. Flow cytometry enables qualitative and quantitative enumeration of lymphocyte subsets, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. This test is important in determining if there are defects in T-cell numbers (as in severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID] or DiGeorge syndrome) or defects in T-cell function (as in common variable immunodeficiency [CVID]).
