Amplification of the target is often used followed by detection of the organism using a nucleic acid probe. These methods work well for viral, fungal, and parasitic diseases. However, in bacterial diseases the antibacterial agent's sensitivity to the strain is also required for adequate treatment decisions. Molecular methods have been used to detect emerging infectious diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus suis sequence type 7, and leishmaniasis. Issues that require further study to advance the field include the development of point-of-care technology for molecular testing in the field, improved approach to treating infectious diseases that present as a biofilm, and identification of microRNA (miRNA) targets in large DNA viruses like human cytomegaloviruses. The field is advancing rapidly and in the future, the microbiology laboratory will rely on molecular diagnostics and not cell growth and biochemical reactions to derive the identification of the infectious agent.",

            "text": "Molecular diagnostic tests can be divided into two primary groups. The first are tests designed to detect the presence of mutations in the human genome that are associated with specific diseases. These tests need to be performed only once in a specific individual\u2019s lifetime. Of course, the discovery of additional disease-linked mutations may initiate additional investigation. The second group of molecular diagnostic assays are designed to detect infectious agents (Espy et al., 2006) or the recurrence of a mutation specifically associated with a tumor the patient has had in the past (Kannim et al., 2009). Bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections can be eradicated and recur at a time in the future requiring repetition of the same molecular assay for detection. The viral load of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are used to monitor therapeutic efficacy and clinical course (Phillips et al., 2001; Bain, 2001). Minimal residual disease detection refers to the analysis of tissue/cells in a patient previously diagnosed with a malignancy to evaluate if therapy was completed successfully or if rare malignant cells are present. For example, monitoring JAK2 V617F mutation has been identified in the majority of Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative disorders with minimal residual disease following specific treatment (Kannim et al., 2009).",

The book was published in 1996 with 134 entries divided into 78 human nuclear genome mutations, 6 human mitochondrial genome mutations (Kiechle et al., 1996a), and 50 infectious disease molecular detection assays (18 viruses, 18 bacteria, 12 parasites, and 2 fungi) (Table 9.1\n). In the past 13 years, many changes and refinements in relationship to the use of infectious disease molecular diagnostic testing in patient care have been made (Espy et al., 2006). New strategies have been devised in nucleic acid purification and amplification (Mardis, 2008). Many of these advances in molecular pathology diagnostic technologies will be described in this handbook. The following review will focus on issues that require vigilance in the face of continuous progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of infectious diseases. The goal is to improve our current approaches to the detection of infectious disease.",

            "text": "Today, hospital-acquired, antibiotic resistance may occur in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial (Table 9.2\n). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first described in 1968 (Zitterkopf, 2008). Bacterial culture on chromagar requires greater than 24 hours for MRSA growth. Meanwhile, the patient being tested should be in isolation, since MRSA transmission in 24 hours from person to person may be as high as 5% to 15%, depending on the distance between the two individuals. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with probes to identify the mecA gene, which encodes methicillin resistance, can decrease the turnaround time for detection to 2\u20134 hours and is more sensitive than culture. Since this screening assay is currently not reimbursed for hospitalized patients, this effort to reduce MRSA prevalence in the hospital becomes an exercise in cost avoidance. The additional cost for caring for a patient with an MRSA infection ranges from $27,000 to $35,000 per patient compared to a patient with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (Zitterkopf, 2008). The rate of subsequent MRSA infection after identification of MRSA colonization is approximately 30% (Davis et al., 2004). The dilemma rests in the ethical question related to who should be screened. There are two viewpoints. The first approach would screen all hospitalized patients at the time of admission. The other approach uses targeted active surveillance, only screening patients at a high risk for MRSA colonization or infection. Examples of high-risk groups are listed in Table 9.3\n. The goal of each of these screening programs is to eradicate MRSA from the patient to reduce the risk of subsequent MRSA infection during the hospitalization. Healthcare workers at the hospital and the patient\u2019s relatives are usually not included in these MRSA screening programs since the goal of the program is not complete eradication of MRSA in a community.",

These projects have provided genotype-to-phenotype revelations related to detection of resistance to antimicrobials, identification of virulence factors, and better understanding of host-pathogen interactions (Fournier et al., 2007). On a larger scale, metagenomics samples the genome sequences of a community of microbial organisms inhabiting a common environment (Hagenholtz and Tyson, 2008).

This tetM gene is associated with the conjugative transposon Tn916. Horizontal transfer of Tn916 with the tetM gene played a central role in the evolution of the epidemic S. suis. ST 7 clone. Also, the three virulence genes of S. suis. ST 7, which include mrp, sly, and ef, were detected by PCR in all species studied (Ye et al., 2008). Horizontal gene transfer or the exchange of DNA between prokaryotes uses several mechanisms such as conjugation, transformation, and phage transduction. Horizontal gene transfer accounts for the genetic plasticity that permits the acquisition of new virulence factors, antibiotic resistance, or metabolism of toxic compounds by bacterial strains.",

            "text": "Since 2000, six new respiratory viruses have been detected (Table 9.4\n) (Dong et al., 2008). The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the Guangdong province of China represents the potential international chaos that an emerging infectious disease can create (Zhao, 2007; Mazzulli et al., 2004). The first index case was located in the city of Foshan, west of Guangzhou province. He had a fever of greater than 39\u00b0C and respiratory symptoms on November 16, 2002, and was hospitalized on November 20, 2002. He recovered on January 8, 2003, but he infected his wife and three other relatives (Zhao, 2007). SARS spread to 25 countries with 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths in three months (Dong et al., 2008; Zhao, 2007). The largest outbreak of SARS outside of Asia was in Toronto, Canada, where 438 people were diagnosed and 44 people died (Mazulli et al., 2004). Symptoms included fever with temperature greater than 38\u00b0C, nonproductive cough, myalgias, headache, and malaise. The incubation period was 2 to 10 days. The disease cannot spread before the onset of symptoms or after recovery from the disease. An international effort lead to the identification of a novel coronavirus, a level 3 pathogen. The published sequence in May 2003 was the Tor 2 strain from the Toronto outbreak. Assays to detect SARS-CoV using PCR were developed for viral RNA detection. Viral load in the upper respiratory tract and feces was low during the first four days and peaks at around the 10th day of the illness (Zhao, 2007). The international economic effect of SARS has been estimated to have been $100 billion. Canceled travel and decreased hotel occupancy in China and Canada was estimated to contribute to a 1% decrease in their national economies. This outbreak demonstrates the importance of molecular techniques that were used to establish the identity of the infectious agent within seven months of the presentation of the index case. This finding was rapidly followed by RT-PCR assay for the detection of SARS-CoV in patient specimens (Espy et al., 2006). Without these techniques, the containment of this outbreak may have taken much longer.",

The general dilemma is the clinical need for the identification of the pathogen in 2-6 hours to facilitate the initiation of therapy (Zitterkopf, 2008; Calfee and Jenkins, 2008). Most culture methods for viruses, bacteria, and fungi require a day or more for results. Identification of a bacterium by molecular methods will not provide any information related to the antibiotic sensitivity of the organism. MRSA is an example of an exception to this generalization. Therefore, most bacteria will need to be cultured to complete the sensitivity studies. A microarray designed to detect the most common gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens could be used as an initial screen in the emergency department or the intensive care units. The miniaturization of the space required to extract the nucleic acid and add the reagents for PCR and the thermocycler for amplification (Holland and Kiechle, 2005) could lead to the development of a molecular diagnostic device small enough to be moved from patient to patient for point-of-care testing. This technology would be simple to use and could be employed in underdeveloped countries for rapid identification of infectious organisms (Dong et al., 2008).",

The extracellular polymeric substance may account for 50% to 90% of the total carbon of biofilms (Donlan, 2002). Biofilms may form on surgical or non-surgically placed indwelling medical devices or may be associated with chronic infections that are unrelated to the presence of foreign bodies (Table 9.5). A biofilm can be 10 to 100 times less susceptible to an antimicrobial compared to the organism grown in suspension. Several factors may play a role in this antibiotic resistance (Lynch and Robertson, 2008). First, the extrapolymeric matrix of the biofilm may trap the antibiotic. However, some antibiotics and antifungals are capable of diffusing into biofilms. Second, different genes are up-regulated and down-regulated in planktonic growth compared to biofilms. For example, S. aureus, when growing in a biofilm, up-regulates genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis and fermentation (Donlan, 2002). The metabolic shift to fermentation is attributable to the oxygen-limited biofilm environment. Biofilm growth may also up-regulate multidrug efflux pumps, which will reduce the antibiotic concentration within a bacteria. Finally, there are a subset of persister cells within a biofilm that are slow-growing and geneticaly programmed to survive exposure to antibiotics (Lynch and Robertson, 2008). They are not mutants and do not grow in the presence of antibiotics. They express a toxin, Rel E, which drives persister organism into a dormant state. High-throughput screening assays have been developed to determine the effectiveness of small molecules to disrupt biofilm development (Junker and clardy, 2007).",

When the intracellular concentration of the autoinducer reaches a threshold, the bacterial population as a whole will alter gene expression (Donlan, 2002; Junker and Clardy, 2007). From 1% to 10% of a microbes genome may be regulated by this process called quorum sensing. The autoinducer used by several gram-negative organisms is acylated homoserine lactone (HSL). For example, quorum sensing controls the expression of virulence genes, including lasB, lasA, apr, toxA, and lasI, using two quorum-sensing systems, las and rhl. The lasI gene product directs the formation of a diffusable extracellular signal, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-HSL. This autoinducer interacts with lasR to activate the virulence genes. Gene expression required for P. aerginosae biofilm formation can be suppressed by the presence of halogenated furanones, which are structurally similar to HSL and interfere with reception of the biofilm formation signal (Junker and Clardy, 2007). Alteration of the quorum sensing mechanism may be an effective method for treating infections that are caused by biofilms.",

This stem-loop structure is called pre-miRNA, which is transported into the cytoplasm by exportin 5 in a Ran-GTP-dependent manner (Rider et al., 2008). The cytoplasmic RNase III type endonuclease, Dicer, then removes the stem loop of pre-miRNA creating a 21- to 24-nucleotide double-stranded RNA with a two-nucleotide, 3\u2019 overhang on each strand. These duplexes are unwound and one strand is preferentially loaded into a protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). This loaded single-stranded RNA is called the guide strand, which directs an endonuclease within RISC to cleave mRNAs that have perfect or near-perfect homology with the guide strand. Nucleotides in position 2 through 7 of the miRNA function as the seed region of the guide strand. Less-stringent homology between miRNA and sites within the 3\u2019 untranslated region of the target will lead to inhibition of translation rather than mRNA degradation.

Most of the other herpes viruses have their miRNA clustered in small regions of the genome, but this clustering does not occur in the HCMV genome (Rider et al., 2008). Viral protein production in large DNA viruses is temporally regulated in three phases (Cullen, 2009). The immediate early phase generates regulatory proteins; the early phase provides a more diverse array of proteins, including those needed for viral genome replication; and the late phase generates primarily structural proteins. In HCMV, most miRNAs are classified as early genes. Two miRNAs, mir-UL70 and mir UL112, are immediate early genes (Rider et al., 2008).",

L. major has 8,298 coding genes and 97 pseudogenes compared to L. infantum, with 8,154 coding genes and 41 pseudogenes and L. braziliensis with 8,153 coding genes and 161 pseudogenes (Peacock et al., 2007). There is a lack of functional information related to more than 50% of the genes identified. L. braziliensis has features distinct from L. major and L. infantum. L. braziliensis has 35 chromosomes, while the other two have 36. L. braziliensis is the only one of the three that has miRNA that could function as gene-silencing agents. A gene has been identified that encodes a Dicer-like protein that converts double-stranded RNA into small, single-stranded miRNAs. Also, a gene that encodes an Argonaute protein or the \u201cslicer,\u201d which is an endonuclease found in the RISC, which cleaves the mRNA that contain sequence homology to the single-stranded RNA called the guide strand within RISC (Peacock et al., 2007).",
