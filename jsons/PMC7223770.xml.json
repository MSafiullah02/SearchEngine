They avoided disclosures perceived to \u201charm or upset patients\u201d and viewed patients\u2019 bodies as vessels for research and physician education; a view not to be superseded by a patient\u2019s preferences (Beauchamp 2011). Prioritizing research and education over a patient\u2019s preferences implies utilitarianism, when the goodness of an action is rooted in creating the most positive outcome for the greatest number of people. With the advent of bioethics, clinical medicine moved to a deontological frame in which the goodness of an action is based on whether that action in itself is right or wrong. Bioethics also phased out the idea that physicians\u2019 perceptions of a patient\u2019s best interests should supersede the patient\u2019s own values. Informed consent allows the patient to decide what happens to their body based on an understanding of the proposed procedure, and this concept was \u201cimposed on medicine through nonmedical forms of authority such as judges in courts and government officials in regulatory agencies\u201d (Beauchamp 2011, p. 515), underscoring the dichotomy between physicians\u2019 and nonphysicians\u2019 perceptions of rights.",

            "text": "Consent is now a well-established tenet of medical practice. Physicians must request a patient\u2019s permission before conducting research or performing procedures on them. Consent \u201cmust be rooted in autonomous choice by patients\u201d (Beauchamp 2011, p. 518) and requires an explanation of the procedure and disclosure of the risks and benefits. Medicine is comprised of committed, talented individuals who dedicate their lives to healing the wounded and comforting the dying; however, certain practices still demonstrate concerning perceptions. Recent surveys and reports reveal that some physicians and medical students still conduct unconsented intimate exams (UIEs) on male and female patients. Unconsented rectal exams on men and women have been reported for training purposes (Reese and Monrouxe 2011; Coldicott et al. 2003a, b) and diagnostic reasons (Chan 2017). Unconsented vaginal exams have also been reported, mostly during gynecological surgeries (Schniederjan and Donovan 2005; Barnes 2012; Picard 2018) but also during abdominal surgeries (Graham 2019; Kelly 2019) and in efforts to rule out sexually transmitted disease in a patient with uncontrolled vomiting (Laird 2019). The referenced studies surveyed hundreds of medical students in the U.S., England, Wales, and Australia. In one study, nearly three-quarters of students believed that patients did not consent to their training exams (Schniederjan and Donovan 2005). In another study, patient consent for intimate exams was not acquired by half of the third-year students or one-third of patients examined by second-year students (Coldicott et al. 2003a, b).",

Students are also careful to navigate complex organizational dynamics inherent to the academic culture of their medical schools. A student refusal to participate in an unconsented intimate exam (UIE) may be viewed as an act of personal embarrassment or unwarranted disobedience. Because students worry about jeopardizing their budding careers, they sometimes participate in clinical experiences that conflict with their personal moral compasses. Fraught dynamics between student and supervisor are central to the controversy of intimate exams on patients.",

            "text": "A pelvic exam is a standard precursor to gynecologic surgery to ascertain the position and mobility of the reproductive organs. The exam requires the insertion of one or two fingers into the vagina to palpate the ovaries and uterus. Rectal exams similarly require digital penetration with the aim of detecting abnormalities in the rectum, prostate, and abdomen. Medical schools consider these digital exams as standard training procedures and typically require all students to practice them during their third-year clerkships. Some institutions have policies in place requiring explicit consent for intimate exams, but they are the exception; most institutions have no such policies. Physicians often assume consent for these training exams, believing it is covered under general admissions clauses\u2014or vague language on consent forms\u2014relating to student participation in teaching hospitals. Consent forms often require the attending physician to hand-write the major risks of a specific procedure but otherwise follow a standard template. Patients and members of the general public are often shocked to learn that physicians and medical students may perform intimate exams on them without explicit consent and believe such exams meet the criteria for battery, malpractice, or sexual assault. Whether these exams meet any such criteria is contested, but this tension underscores the dichotomy between societal and medical views of the intimate regions of the body. While the medical professional may aspire to a professional, scientific detachment, patients simply do not think of their intimate regions in a detached or neutral way and tend to have an inherent conviction that consent practices should mark this distinction.",

Singer considers UIEs \u201cdefinitely among the most egregious of\u2026 ethical issues\u201d in medical schools (Boyles 2003); Caplan (2018b) recently called for \u201can abrupt and immediate halt\u201d to these exams; and Friesen (2018a) refers to UIEs as \u201cimmoral and indefensible\u201d (p. 298). Adashi, a former dean at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, states, \u201cviewed in hindsight, it is difficult to see how the conduct of unapproved pelvic examinations by medical students could have been rationalized, let alone condoned\u201d (2019).",

Other surveys have similar positive feedback from patients related to their willingness to participate (Friesen 2018a), and students also have additional training opportunities in clinics and during training sessions with GTAs. In sum, explicit consent is an unlikely barrier to physician training.",

In response to Coldicott\u2019s landmark study on intimate exams (2003a, b), Kaushik, an ophthalmic surgeon, argues in favor of the status quo, believing it is \u201cdangerous\u201d to consider intimate exams differently, and that \u201cexamination of the fundus of the uterus is just as intimate for a gynaecologist [emphasis added] as examining the fundus of the eye is to an ophthalmologist\u201d (2003a, b, p. 1327). This thinking contributes to physician preference for a standard, genericized surgical consent form for all surgeries. Yet other physicians understand that the frame of reference should not be about whether the physician finds the exam to be intimate. Rather, the decades-long conflict relating to UIEs relates to how these exams are perceived by the patients themselves.",

Critics may argue that patients are not harmed if they are anesthetized (and therefore unable to remember the procedure), and perhaps that is true. However, some patients have recently woken during an UIE under anesthesia. Ashley Weitz, a young woman in Utah, sought emergency care for uncontrolled vomiting and when the physician suggested a pelvic exam to rule out a sexually transmitted disease, she explicitly declined (Laird 2019). Weitz passed out from the sedative effects of Phenergan then \u201cwoke up screaming\u201d (Laird 2019) because the physician was performing a pelvic exam. A survivor of childhood sexual assault, Weitz was so traumatized by the unconsented exam that she became an advocate for a law banning the procedure in her home state. Weitz is not the only patient to wake during an intimate exam (McDermott and Johnson 2019), and the idea that patients are unaware under anesthesia is also increasingly refuted: a large U.S. multicenter study found that intra-anesthetic awareness occurs in nearly 2000 cases every year (Sebel et al. 2004). Patients with awareness during surgeries most commonly report \u201chearing conversations\u2026 But there are many cases where they report pain, paralysis and anxiety because of the fact that they feel helpless [and some] patients describe this situation as the worst experience they ever had in a hospital\u201d (Kotsovolis and Komninos 2009). One compelling report is from an anesthesiologist who, as a patient, was aware of aspects of his urogenital surgical experience and found his experience \u201cterrifying\u201d (Peduto et al. 1994). Therefore, the assumption that patients are unaware of their unconsented exams may be questionable.",

In one such case (Rees and Monrouxe 2011), a male patient was conscious but unaware of receiving sequential digital rectal exams by several students since a sheet divided him from the students. Two of the students discussed this case as part of a recent multicenter study on intimate exams. One of the students stated:\u2026they just had a queue of medical students doing a rectal examination he wasn\u2019t consented but\u2026 you don\u2019t have the confidence to say \u2018no\u2019 you just do it\u2026I think there was [sic] about three or four medical students\u2026 [the patient] had no idea that we were there and\u2026 none of the theatre staff spoke to him about what was happening (Rees and Monrouxe 2011, p. 268).\nThese cases find their way into public dialogue. As cases of conscious and unconscious UIEs become more widely known, patients may suspect their physicians are failing to fully disclose what will happen to their bodies during an exam.

            "text": "Medical students can also experience harm when the status quo goes unchallenged. As discussed, Ubel\u2019s study found that medical students were less supportive of explicit consent after their obstetrics and gynecology clerkship. No other rotations were reported to have this effect on medical students.\u2026this decline [in valuing the importance of informed consent] is not gradual and inexorable, but instead\u2026 it is associated with specific experiences. Students who have completed obstetrics/gynecology clerkships place significantly less importance on seeking permission from women\u2026 (Ubel et al., 2003, p. 578).This shift in perceptions of consent is an example of ethical erosion, an attrition of values, leading to decreased respect for the patient\u2019s autonomy and emotional detachment. This shift may be attributable to the hidden curriculum, described by Mahood (2011) as:a socialization process [by which] norms and values transmitted to future physicians often undermine the formal messages of the declared curriculum\u2026 [it] consists of what is implicitly taught by example day to day, not the explicit teaching of lectures, grand rounds, and seminars. Students move from being open-minded to being closed-minded; from being intellectually curious to narrowly focusing on facts; from empathy to emotional detachment; from idealism to cynicism; and often from civility and caring to arrogance and irritability. This erosion of empathy and \u201cvanquishing of virtue\u201d is repeatedly documented in studies of physicians in training (p. 983).Feudtner et al. (1994) have examined ethical erosion of medical students during their clerkships. Nearly all of the affected students in their study overheard physicians disparage patients, and over half observed members of the clinical team engage in unethical behavior and felt that their own ethical principles suffered during their clerkship. When students are faced with ethical dilemmas, Feudtner et al. find that \u201cfor at least a sizable minority, exposures to\u2026 [ethical] dilemmas coincide with deterioration of the students\u2019 ethical self-identities\u201d (1994, p. 677), and those who saw others participate in unethical behaviors were increasingly likely to do so themselves.",

The experience of some students may be more accurately described in terms of moral distress, a \u201cresponse to a perceived conflict between what one is expected to do and what morality requires\u201d (Weber 2016, p. 249). Moral distress may arise \u201cwhen one knows the right thing to do, but institutional constraints make it nearly impossible to pursue the right course of action\u201d (Jameton 1984, p. 6). Moral distress is a \u201cuniquely painful phenomenon\u2026 frequently associated with feelings of being powerless\u201d (Tigard 2019, p. 605), and it correlates with compassion fatigue and high turnover rates. When Shawn Barnes (2012) was still a medical student, he felt coerced by institutional constraints to perform unconsented pelvic exams. He stated:For 3 weeks, four to five times a day, I was asked to, and did, perfothat the completion of the obstetricsrm pelvic examinations on anesthetized women, without specific consent, solely for the purpose of my education. [When] the patient was asleep, the attending or resident would ask me to perform a pelvic examination on the patient for educational purposes. To my shame, I obeyed\u2026 My medical education experience has reinforced the notion that the medical student should not question the practices of those above him or her. I was very conflicted about performing an act that I felt was unethical, but owing to both the culture of medicine and my own lack of courage, I did not immediately speak out against what I was asked to do by residents and attendings\u201d (Barnes 2012, p. 941).Barnes felt powerless at the time but later chose to take action and helped to pass Hawaii\u2019s law banning unconsented pelvic exams. Symptoms of moral distress can ensue after direct or indirect participation in ethically questionable behavior, so nurses and other members of the clinical team may also experience moral distress when they witness or facilitate UIEs. It is not unreasonable to assume that indirect participants of UIEs may also experience ethical erosion. Thus, a move to an explicit consent process is not only good for the patient; it is also beneficial for the health and well-being of students and practitioners because explicit consent safeguards them from ethical erosion and symptoms of moral distress. When institutions decline to make consent explicit, they are a complicit party to ethical erosion and moral distress. And when institutions embrace an explicit consent process, they signal to their students and practitioners that they care about their well-being and are willing to make a small policy change to protect students\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 mental health and well-being.",

When medical schools enact an explicit consent process, they demonstrate the institution\u2019s respect for the patient as the gatekeeper to their body, recognize medical students\u2019 worth, and bolster their relationship with the general public. As discussed, most unconsented intimate exams are for training purposes on anesthetized patients during urological and obstetrical/gynecological clerkships, and some UIEs have occurred for diagnostic purposes, on conscious patients, or during abdominal procedures. A sufficient resolution therefore requires explicit, institution-wide policies and also requires time, a precious commodity in medicine. Mercurio (2018) reflects on the physician\u2019s daily challenges, stating:We know what we ought to do. The right to informed consent or permission, for example, has important ethical underpinnings\u2026 Most often, we fall short of our ethical ideals not from lack of deliberation, poor analysis, or inadequate understanding of ethical principles. We fall short because of time (p. 3).\nThese words should be taken to heart. Even when time is constrained (and it always seems to be), physicians should not overlook or gloss over the consent process with the patient. Indeed, the aspect of time is a fundamental determinant of resolving the decades-long conflict of UIEs. We spend our time on what we value. Spending time on explicit consent sends a signal to all parties that a patient\u2019s permission is sacred and valued. The resolution to UIEs requires a multi-tiered response. First, institutions should develop an explicit consent policy for all intimate exams. Second, medical school curriculum should support the explicit consent policy. Third, institutions should consider top-down changes to bolster ethics across the organization.",

A notable example of integrated ethics includes the model developed for the Veterans Health Administration (Fox et al. 2010). Fox\u2019s model consists of three functions which target ethics at \u201cthe level of decisions and actions;\u2026 the level of systems and processes; and\u2026the level of environment and culture\u201d (p. 8). Work by Callahan et al. (2002) can also be considered: they promote \u201cthree trust-building tactics: \u2018accountability, reliance, and aspiration\u2019\u2026 These principles provide people and mechanisms to reach the outcome of an ethical organizational culture\u201d (p. 201). For instance, they suggest an ombudsperson to build employees\u2019 trust in the institution\u2019s policies and standards and recommend principles to increase empathy and trust and thereby foster organizational integrity. Similarly, Lachman (2008) suggests an implementation of committees, forums, and procedures to amplify integrity, and Greene and Latting (2004) recommend the formation of an organizational ethics committee. While these scholars propose robust approaches to institutional ethics, even small organizational changes can have lasting and far-reaching effects. To bolster a sound ethical culture, institutions should review these studies to identify methods most suitable to their institution. In summary, recommendations include an explicit consent policy and enhancements to both medical school curriculum and institutional culture.",

The McMath family did not feel heard by their practitioners when their repeated calls to curb Jahi\u2019s post-surgical loss of blood were disregarded\u2014neglect believed to have caused her brain death\u2014and the case is emblematic of widespread racial bias in medicine (Goodwin 2018). Other families may also experience treatment denial, such as vaccine-hesitant families who are denied pediatric care (Flanagan-Klygis et al. 2005). These fissures reflect the challenge of conveying complex medical information to families who may already mistrust the medical system and the fissures seem to be so far-reaching that some fear there is little hope for resolution. Other recent news stories have covered Larry Nassar\u2019s rampant abuse of his pediatric patients (Mountjoy 2019) and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s investigation uncovering \u201cmore than 3500 cases of sexual misconduct by physicians across the nation since 1999\u201d (Teegardin and Norder 2019, p. 1).

These ill effects are surely not intended by physicians whose goals are to heal and comfort patients. When Rhodes urges physicians to \u201cseek trust and deserve it as their moral law, as their creed,\u201d she notes that physicians should \u201cpay serious attention to the patient\u2019s view of what is good\u201d (2001, p. 497).
