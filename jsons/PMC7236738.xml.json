            "text": "While a wide range of disinfectants may be used in high-income settings, including chlorine, alcohol-based products, glutaraldehyde, quaternary ammonium compounds, and hydrogen peroxide (12), disinfection in low-income and emergency settings with limited access to basic supplies (\u201clow-resource\u201d) is primarily chlorine-based, as this disinfectant is inexpensive and widely available. Another advantage of chlorine is its broad microbicidal spectrum, while disadvantages include corrosive and irritant properties at high concentrations, potential surface staining, inactivation by organic matter, as well as rapid chlorine decay in solution for some chlorine compounds (12,13). Four chlorine compounds are commonly used in emergency response. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), also referred to as household bleach, is widely available as a stabilized (pH 9-11), colorless liquid at concentrations 4,000-6,000 ppm and a shelf-life of at least a month at 25-30\u00b0C (13,14). Electrolyzed water \u2013 or generated NaOCl (gNaOCl) \u2013 is produced by electrolysis of a salt (NaCl) solution, has a close-to-neutral pH, and is generated on site, as it expires in days to weeks without stabilization (13). In addition to hypochlorous acid, gNaOCl may contain reactive oxygen species that contribute to disinfection (15). Sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) is available as a stable powder; once in solution, however, it has a low pH (\u223c6) and short shelf-life as it decays rapidly (within hours) (13). It has been reported to be less sensitive to inactivation by organic matter than other chlorine compounds (16). Finally, calcium hypochlorite or high-test hypochlorite (HTH) is a salt of hypochlorite, like NaOCl, however it is more commonly found in granular form and produces solutions at pH 9-11 that are as stable as NaOCl (13,14).",

We identified studies using pathogens with potential to cause outbreaks in low-resource settings from the list of references processed through abstract screening. These studies were included in a summary table and narrative synthesis. The seven selected pathogens for which data were available were: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella enterica, hepatitis A virus, rotavirus, norovirus, and Ebola virus. M. tuberculosis was responsible for 1.6 million deaths in 2017, making it among the global top ten causes of death, 95% of which in low-income countries (31). Vibrio cholerae causes an estimated 95,000 annual cholera deaths among vulnerable populations worldwide (32). Like Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp. are Gram-negative bacteria responsible for diarrheal disease outbreaks. One serovar is particularly important: S. enterica serovar Typhi is estimated to cause 11.9 million cases of typhoid fever and 129,000 deaths per year in low- and middle-income countries (33), and the frequency of prolonged, severe outbreaks has been reported to increase across sub-Saharan Africa (34). The hepatitis A virus produces explosive outbreaks, and causes approximately 1.4 million cases per year, primarily in areas without adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (35,36). Rotavirus is responsible for approximately half of the global diarrheal disease burden of 215,000 annual deaths in children under 5 years, concentrated in low-income countries (37,38). Norovirus is also a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, causing approximately 200,000 deaths per year, primarily in low-income countries and among children under 5 years (39,40). Ebola virus, is among five viral hemorrhagic fever agents on the list of ten priority pathogens identified on the World Health Organization (WHO) Blueprint list (41), and is responsible for an ongoing epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (42). Studies where a surrogate was proposed for one of the seven selected pathogens were included in the narrative synthesis as well.",

Best et al. (44) noted that M. tuberculosis is not typically used in disinfection studies due to safety concerns and slow growth, and tested M. smegmatitis as a potential non-pathogenic and faster-growing surrogate for M. tuberculosis. Varying levels of resistance were observed depending on the tested disinfectant. When exposed to sodium hypochlorite, M. smegmatitis appeared less resistant than M. tuberculosis, highlighting the need to interpret surrogate testing results with caution (44). Other bacteria from the same genus, M. terrae, underwent 8.19 log reduction following exposure to 2,500 ppm sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes (CT = 12,500 mg \u00d7 min/L) (54). The limited log reduction observed for treatment with CT up to 10,000 mg \u00d7 min/L for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the high variation in log reductions for related surrogates highlights the need for further evaluation of effective disinfection strategies. Specifically, there is a data gap on exposure times and concentrations producing CT factors higher than 10,000 mg \u00d7 min/L against M. tuberculosis. Treatments producing CT factors below 10,000 mg \u00d7 min/L are likely insufficient for M. tuberculosis disinfection.",

On stainless steel, using the ASTM standard soil load, the hepatitis A virus was exposed to 2,500 ppm for 5 minutes (CT factor = 12,500 min \u00d7 mg/L), resulting in a 4.4 log reduction (54).

Lastly, sodium hypochlorite was identified as the most efficacious disinfectant in one study using the hepatitis A virus on stainless steel, aluminum, copper, high-density polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride, with approximately 5 log reduction after 5 minutes exposure to 3,000 ppm NaOCl (CT = 15,000 min \u00d7 mg/L) across all materials (51).

Comparisons between human norovirus and the proposed surrogates were made in four studies. Park and Sobsey (69) determined that similar times (CT = 94-380 mg \u00d7 min/L) were required for a 3-log inactivation in human norovirus, murine norovirus, and MS2 exposed to gNaOCl on stainless steel and noted that MS2 resembles human norovirus in terms of persistence and elution from surfaces. Moorman et al. (61) also tested gNaOCl (CT = 250-7,500 mg \u00d7 min/L) on stainless steel and observed similar inactivation in Tulane virus (3.0-4.1 log) and human norovirus (1.6-5.0 log) with increasing exposure times in absence of soil load. Cromeans et al.

In the second study, similar experimental procedures were used to compare three Ebola virus variants, including the Makona variant, isolated during the 2014 West African outbreak, the Mayinga variant, from the first reported Ebola outbreak, in 1976 in Zaire (now DRC), and the Kikwit variant, from an outbreak in 1995. Concentrations of 1,000-5,000 ppm NaOCl achieved complete inactivation of all three virus variants within 5 minutes, as observed in the previous study, however the Makona variant was more resistant to lower chlorine concentrations (0.05%-0.1%) than previous variants of the Ebola virus (58). In a third study, where aircraft-relevant surfaces were used, sodium hypochlorite (8,000 ppm, with <1% potassium permanganate) achieved complete inactivation \u2013 i.e. >5 log reduction on painted aluminum, >3 log reduction on seat-belt strapping material \u2013 of the Ebola Yambuku variant (from the 1976 outbreak in the DRC) after 10 minutes (CT = 80,000 mg \u00d7 L/min) (56). In contrast to these three studies, incomplete inactivation of the Ebola virus (Makona variant) in a human blood matrix after exposure to 5,000 ppm NaOCl for 15 minutes on aluminum and stainless steel was reported in a recent publication, with a reduction of only 0.9 log compared to complete inactivation when the virus was mixed with cell growth medium (59).",

Of the 89 studies investigated, the most common disinfectant application modes were pipetting (n = 54, 61%), immersion (n= 20, 22%), spraying (n = 8, 9%), or wiping (n = 5, 6%). Because disinfection is often combined with cleaning procedures, wiping was investigated and was found to have an effect on viruses and spores even in absence of disinfectant, suggesting that the mechanical action of wiping contributes to reducing contamination levels on surfaces (49,74). With spraying, ensuring contact between disinfectant and test organisms can be challenging (75,76). Additionally, chlorine loss during the process \u2013 from spray nozzle to the targeted surface \u2013 is a concern (77). Ni et al. (2016) found consistent increases in efficacy with increasing disinfectant spraying time from 0.5 to 2 minutes and keeping similar exposure times after spraying. A proposed explanation for variable efficacies observed between studies is the use of different spraying equipment, such as gas-powered pressurized sprayers producing high spray velocities and hand-held spray bottles (78).",

Amongst the 89 studies identified, 27 (30%) tested more than one surface, including 13 (15%) that used porous surfaces (ceramic, fabric, rubber or wood). Porous surfaces were identified as more challenging to disinfect in 8 of these 13 studies. For chlorine-based disinfection in particular, Baek et al. (86) observed lower inactivation in E. coli on wood (3.34 log) and rubber (4.69 log) compared to non-porous surfaces such as stainless steel, glass and polyethylene (5.05-5.18 log) after exposure to NaOCl. While Park et al. (80) found no difference in gNaOCl efficacy against S. aureus on five non-porous surfaces (1.7-1.9 log), Kim et al. (87) reported consistently lower log reductions in S. aureus on scratched polyethylene, polypropylene, glass, and stainless steel compared to the same surfaces without scratches after disinfection with NaOCl. The influence of surface structure on disinfection is further affirmed with observations in another study that E. coli was more challenging to disinfect on heavy duty tarp compared to smoother surfaces like nitrile and stainless steel (83). Lombardi et al. (85) observed lower log reductions in LPAIV on wood (0.0-1.9) compared to metal (3.1-3.7) and plastic (3.9-4.3) surfaces after exposure to 750 ppm NaOCl or HTH for 10 minutes. Julian et al. (15) compared gNaOCl and NaOCl on PVC and stainless steel; surface type was statistically significant for murine norovirus inactivation (overall higher on PVC) but not for MS2. Yeargin et al.

A wide range of matrices representing soiled surfaces were used in included studies, from the standard ASTM formulation with tryptone, bovine serum albumin, and bovine mucin to human stool, serum, or shrimp and pork meat (Tables S1-S4). The impact of specific matrices used to represent soil loading on observed efficacies are unclear from this review, with the notable exception of the results reported above for the Ebola virus, which was more resistant to disinfection in human blood compared to other testing media (59). Given the known impacts of chlorine demand on chlorine disinfection efficacy, the large variation in impacts of soil loading on efficacy is surprising. However, one potential explanation is the variation in chlorine demand of chosen specific matrices. For example, the formulation recommended in the ASTM standard has a low chlorine demand, and as such may not be appropriate to assess chlorine-based disinfection against pathogens that are shed in bodily fluids such as vomit and stool (83). The soil load selection is a good example of the trade-off needed between testing conditions that are relevant to real-world applications (e.g. working with surfaces in contact with seafood) and generating efficacy data that can be compared to the existing literature and support the development of guidelines.",

Given the variation in study findings, we advocate conservative approaches to field disinfection relying on high CT factors for chlorine, driven largely by the assumption that chlorine-based disinfectants are readily available. We recommend following pathogen-specific target CT factors rather than aggregating pathogens by type (i.e., bacteria, virus, protozoa), as we believe that the latter would misrepresent the complexity of surface disinfection efficacy data. Specifically, the data extracted in this review supports use of the following conservative target CT factors: >15,000 mg \u00d7 min/L for the hepatitis A virus, >20,000 mg \u00d7 min/L for rotavirus and norovirus, and >80,000 mg \u00d7 min/L for the Ebola virus, as relatively consistent evidence \u2013 although from small numbers of studies \u2013 was available for these pathogens. Data for Gram-negative bacteria exhibited particularly high variability, leading to a cautious (and possibly unrealistic) recommendation of 200,000 mg \u00d7 min/L for V. cholerae and >24,000 mg \u00d7 min/L for Salmonella spp. Insufficient data was available to formulate a recommendation for disinfection of M. tuberculosis. The appropriate combination of chlorine concentration and exposure time to achieve a given CT factor should be selected depending on safety concerns (as high chlorine concentrations may be irritant and corrosive) and practical considerations with regards to applicable exposure times, in compliance with relevant environmental and safety guidelines. Additional rigorous research is needed to better resolve (lower) recommendations for specific pathogens to ensure adequate protection of human health. Furthermore, studies to inform disinfection against the WHO Blueprint priority viruses (41) other than the Ebola virus are needed.",

Each of these is briefly summarized hereafter. Increases in observed inactivation with mechanical action (shaking during immersion, wiping) were reported, as well as specificities of spraying (equipment, spray characteristics, and spraying time matter). Comparisons between the four chlorine compounds typically available in emergency response suggest no clear difference in terms of efficacy. Several studies mentioned that porous surfaces are more challenging to disinfect \u2013 and to use in laboratory testing \u2013 than non-porous surfaces, which is a concern in outbreaks in healthcare facilities, where mattresses, linens, cloths may need to be disinfected, and in households, where an even wider range of porous materials (wood, ceramic, carpets) may be found. Soil load is expected to impact chlorine disinfection efficacy, as chlorine is inactivated by organic matter, though this review did not observe systematic reductions in efficacy due to soil load. This may be due to the wide range of substances used as soil loads. Notably, no matrix was identified that is known to accurately mimic bodily fluids excreted by cholera or Ebola patients and the development of appropriate soil load mixtures for laboratory testing is still needed.",

It is therefore not surprising that most studies focus on stainless steel and chlorine. What is striking, however, is the variability in reported efficacies for similar test organisms, surface types, and disinfectants (Figure 2), which made it infeasible to define appropriate aggregation categories to perform a meta-analysis. We hypothesize that this variability reflects the variability in testing procedures, which was also identified as a concern in large-scale, inter-laboratory studies for the development of standard methods, where researchers advocated for the use of large numbers of replicates (79,82,93). For the registration of bactericidal disinfectants, the US Environmental Protection Agency requires tests to be carried out following the AOAC standard methods using 60 surface carriers on at least 3 different days, with a qualitative outcome after disinfection (positive/negative) (43), while the quantitative ASTM standard method requires triplicate controls and a minimum of five replicates (91). In this review, the average number of replicates for data points that passed full text screening was 3.9. A quantitative decision-making framework has recently been proposed by Parker et al. (94) to determine whether the achieved reproducibility for surface disinfection efficacy experiments is acceptable, and we recommend this be more widely adopted in reporting surface disinfection laboratory efficacy results. Lastly, the data extraction spreadsheet (available in Supplementary Materials) includes 1,421 data points that can be filtered by any user depending on the test organism, surface, or disinfectant of interest. We believe this database is a useful tool for those who are designing surface disinfection experiments or searching for specific disinfection efficacy data. This review focused on chlorine-based disinfectants because of their widespread availability and use in low-resource settings, however data was also extracted from studies using other disinfectants (Table 2) and our dataset could be further analyzed to synthesize surface disinfection efficacy outcomes for alternative disinfectants or include additional test organisms.",

Similarly, relevant studies published in languages other than those understood by our review team may have been missed. Furthermore, the requirement to only include disinfectants that have five or more relevant publications may have limited our ability to identify novel disinfectants potentially usable in outbreak response. Additionally, this systematic review primarily focused on the scientific literature. Alternative approaches such as screening US EPA-registered disinfectants for ease of use, cost, and international availability may allow identification of other relevant information for the development of recommendations for disinfection in low-resource settings.",

We therefore recommend that laboratory experiments increase reproducibility, for example through replicating experiments over different days or periods of time. More importantly, the high variation in the well-controlled laboratory experiments highlights the need for demonstrating sufficient efficacy under field conditions. We therefore strongly recommend field-based testing and monitoring to ensure effectiveness is achieved in situ. An efficient strategy for laboratory testing could be to conduct studies comparing priority pathogens to test organisms that have been widely studied, such as S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, feline calicivirus, murine norovirus and MS2, or Bacillus spp., so that existing data (available in Supplementary Materials) could be extrapolated to inform surface disinfection guideline development in low-resource settings with minimal additional laboratory testing.",
