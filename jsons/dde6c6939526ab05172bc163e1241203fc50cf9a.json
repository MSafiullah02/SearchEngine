As COVID-19 spreads its tentacles deeper into the lives of our people, we scramble to fight this new inferno in a community that is still recovering from an unfortunate past. One of the shrinking cities of the United States, Detroit has faced urban decay due to a multitude of socioeconomic factors. A dramatic decline in population, loss of industrial and working-class jobs, and vanishing businesses have all hit our city hard in the last several decades.",

The remaining population is disproportionately elderly lacks resources and transportation, and is heavily dependent on state help. 1,2 Today, 36% of Detroiters live in poverty-1 in 3 people in the city that is home to Motown and the world's original automotive manufacturing center. With the city's bankruptcy in 2018 came the disintegration of a failing healthcare system, and in fiscal recovery, the critical public health framework and its safety net have not followed.",

Nowhere are the social determinants of health as glaring and impactful as in Detroit. The high rates of unemployment and medically uninsured, in addition to reliance on a dramatically reduced auto industry for jobs, all underpin the current invasion by the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown poses a huge barrier for daily wage earners; it is an enormous complicating factor in this dire situation.",

A population with an overburdened healthcare system that is underserved socially, fiscally, and educationally is ill equipped to tackle this deadly adversary. With cases doubling daily and mortality dramatically escalating, we have become the next epicenter in the United States. The growth of the infection rate and the total cumulative numbers of cases in Detroit are high, with a curve steeper than that of New York due to the dangerous combination of inadequate resources and higher rates of comorbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. To top it off, testing has been massively inadequate. Our vulnerability puts us in a very unfortunate situation. SARS-CoV-2 has revealed the previously unrecognized susceptibility of a vulnerable community unaware of its precarious situation.",

We start each day with a renewed vigor to fight the microbial opponent and aggressive efforts to safeguard the health of our people.
