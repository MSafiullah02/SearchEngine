            "text": "Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting infants, young children, and immune-compromised patients; however, currently no vaccine is available for prevention of RSV infections. The overwhelming majority of our knowledge of how RSV causes infection is based upon studies that have been carried out using traditional 2D methods, with cells cultured on flat plastic dishes. Although these simplified culture systems are essential to gain an insight into the fundamentals of host-pathogen interactions, cells in 2D are not exposed to the same conditions as cells in 3D tissues in the body and are therefore a poor representation of thein vivo microenvironment. In this study, we aim to develop the first 3D culture model for RSV infection using A549 cells to test its utility for RSV pathogenesis. Methods: To generate spheroids, A549 cells were cultured using ultra-low attachment plates to generate 25 \u00d7 10 3 cell spheroids. The viability of the spheroids was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay and flow cytometry showing prominent live cells throughout the spheroids confirming high viability over seven days of incubation. Results: Immunostaining of A549 spheroids inoculated with RSV, showed time-dependent dissemination of the viral antigen RSV-F within the spheroid, resulting in syncytia formation and a 3-fold increase in mucin secretion compared to the uninfected cells. Additionally, RSV successfully replicated in the spheroids producing infectious virus as early as day one post-inoculation and was sustained for up to 7 days post-inoculation. Conclusions: Results show that A549 spheroids are susceptible and permissive for RSV since they exhibit the characteristics of RSV infection including syncytia formation and mucin overexpression, suggesting that A549 spheroids can be used a promising model for studying RSV in vitro.",

Studies have demonstrated that cells undergo different biologic responses when grown in 3D compared with 2D settings [13, 14] . They can differ in their morphology, with an altered cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. Other changes include different proliferation rates, signaling processes and differentiation potential. Many of these differences are believed to result from the fact that cells grown as monolayers on flat plastic surfaces are not subjected to the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, soluble factors, matrix composition and stiffness, oxygen and nutrient gradients, protein concentration gradients and mechanical stresses, as they would in their source tissues [10] .",

The cell pellets were resuspended in 300 l of 1:1 mixture of complete media and trypan blue (T8154-100 ml Sigma). Viable cell count was determined using a hemocytometer. Alternatively, the cell pellets were resuspended in a 0.02 M calcein-AM solution (C3099 Life Technologies) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min in the dark. Following incubation, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in 800 l of PBS and passed through the Guava EasyCyte8 Flow Cytometer. A total of 5000 live events were excited at 488 nm per sample and measured for green fluorescence at 530 nm. Gating analysis was performed using FlowJo (FlowJo LLC) cytometry analysis software and a representative density-plot graph was shown.",

A prominent RSV-F protein staining was noted at day 3 post-inoculation (Fig. 3A) that disseminated towards the core of the spheroid by day 7 post-inoculation (Fig. 3B) . Mild syncytia formation induced by RSV infection was also noted at the spheroid rim at 3 days post-inoculation (Fig. 3A insets) . The intensity of RSV-F protein staining increased by 2-fold on day 7 compared to day 3 post-inoculation (Fig. 3C) . These findings indicate that the virus has effectively infected the spheroids spreading towards its center throughout infection. Additionally, a 2.6-fold increase in MUC1 expression was noted in the spheroids on day 3 post-infection compared to mock (uninfected). MUC1 production further increased, reaching 3.25-fold at day 7 post-inoculation relative to mock (Fig. 3D) .

            "text": "3D culture models have well demonstrated utility for studying bacterial and viral pathogens. Previous studies revealed that spheroids are more representative models for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica compared to monolayer cultures in terms of invasiveness, histopathology, and immunopathology [33, 34] . Cells grown in spheroids were also shown to be the first definitive model for human norovirus [18] and hepatitis C virus studies [19] , which lacked a suitable cell culture and murine study models. These viruses were capable of replicating and triggering a cytopathic effect in the 3D spheroid. Moreover, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and coronavirus have all been successfully studied in 3D cultures [17] . Recently, Zou et al. [35] developed human adult stem cell (ASC)-derived airway 3D that can be utilized to assess infectivity of emerging influenza viruses to human. Another work by Imle and colleagues introduced a 3D culture of primary human CD4 T lymphocytes as an ex vivo model system to study HIV-1 in tissue-like microenvironments [36] . Here, we established a simple and economic 3D spheroid culture of alveolar type II epithelial cells (A549) as a model to study RSV infection. This culture model can provide a tool for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying RSV pathogenesis and to potentially test the effectiveness of antiviral molecules. Syncytia formation and excessive mucin (MUC1) production are the hallmarks of RSV infection in vivo [8, 9] . In vitro, when A549 monolayers were infected with RSV, MUC1 secretion was only recorded for up to 3 days, after which it started to decline [37, 38] . Contrary, studies performed on monolayers of primary human airway epithelial cells report syncytium formation and increased mucin production for up to 6 days post-infection [39] [40] [41] . Our results showed that A549 cells grown in spheroids are susceptible and permissive of RSV, which disseminated to the center of the spheroids and induced excessive mucin secretion for up to 7 days post-infection accompanied with syncytia formation. This shows that A549 cells in spheroids behave more closely to primary cells than to A549 monolayers in terms of mucin production and syncytia formation upon RSV infection. Furthermore, we showed that the infection was productive up to day 7 post-inoculation with the virus progressively spreading towards the center of the spheroid. Notably, the virus yield dropped on day by one log 10 pfu/ml, which could be explained by the cell death happening at the core of the spheroids. Overall, our data clearly show that A549 spheroids constitute a promising model of RSV infection studies.",
