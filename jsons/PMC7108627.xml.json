The cause, a coronavirus, was unknown for the first several months, making public health measures difficult and raising concern among the public. Only recently has SARS been identified as a new disease (Anand et al., 2003; Anonymous, 2003a,b; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2003; Donnelly et al., 2003). Due to the absence of effective vaccines or drugs, and especially due to its rapidly spread via the respiratory route, SARS has frightened the public (Anonymous, 2003c\u2013e; Mei et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2003).",

The adoption of these measures, due to the initially unclear nature of SARS transmission, actually increased panic among the Chinese people who began wearing masks, reducing the chances of outdoor activities, disinfecting the environment and washing their hands. This survey attempted in a post hoc manner to document the changes in people's behavior that may have resulted from 2 weeks of health promotion activities.",

The questionnaire was especially concerned about the changes in health behavior people may have undertaken around late April and early May 2003.",

Numerous scientists have been working in the affected countries to provide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support as required. In almost all documented cases, SARS is spread through close face-to-face contact with infected droplets when a patient sneezes or coughs. Some of the epidemic's origins remain unclear. For SARS, three activities\u2014case detection, patient isolation and contact tracing\u2014can reduce the number of people exposed to each infectious case and eventually break the chain of transmission. In the absence of a vaccine, the most effective way to control a new disease such as SARS is to break the chain of transmission from infected to healthy persons (Buckley, 2003; Donnelly et al., 2003; Eaton, 2003; Kontoyiannis et al., 2003; Mackay, 2003; Mandavilli, 2003). Unfortunately, these activities brought panic to ordinary citizens and did not show there is any gender difference, especially during the early days when the Chinese government decided that SARS was a real public health problem.",

A full 2 weeks into major informational and control measures, many people still did not have complete knowledge about the epidemic. This study documented that even without thorough knowledge following health promotion and information efforts, most persons changed their health behaviors to avoid SARS infection. The example of farmers, who had low knowledge and yet still reported behavior change, is illustrative of people's desire to protect themselves.",

SARS is unlikely to be the last emerging epidemic of our times and so the lessons learned here will be of value in anticipation of future disease outbreaks. The results also imply that the provision of health information on SARS should be adapted to the various sociodemographic groups, such as those based on occupation/work settings, in order to increase access and understanding.",
