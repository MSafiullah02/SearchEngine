            "text": "Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9s pendant une p\u00e9riode m\u00e9diane de 22,5 jours. Le taux de mortalit\u00e9 s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 20,0 %. Les chercheurs ont constat\u00e9 des facteurs de risque classiques de SARM-ONN dans sept des dix cas (70,0 %). Sept des dix patients faisant de l'empy\u00e8me avaient eu un drain thoracique. Aucun des patients n'avait d'ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u00e9montr\u00e9s d'IVRS. Chez huit des dix patients, le test s\u00e9rologique et le test d'amplification des acides nucl\u00e9iques n'ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 aucune manifestation de co-infection virale aigu\u00eb. Huit souches \u00e9taient des SARMC-10 (USA300). Les deux autres \u00e9taient une souche li\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement au USA300 et une souche USA1100. CONCLUSION : La pneumonie secondaire au SARM-ONN peut se manifester en l'absence d'IVRS ant\u00e9rieure. Les infections caus\u00e9es par le SARM-ONN s'associent \u00e0 une morbidit\u00e9 et une mortalit\u00e9 importantes. Les cliniciens doivent conna\u00eetre cette entit\u00e9 clinique, notamment chez les patients qui font partie de groupes vuln\u00e9rables qui les pr\u00e9disposent \u00e0 \u00eatre expos\u00e9s \u00e0 cette bact\u00e9rie. a prevalence of 5.5% has been observed in a marginalized population (5) , and a prevalence of 27% in wound cultures from a communitybased sample of intravenous drug users (6) . Outbreaks of communityassociated MRSA (CA-MRSA) have been described in the United States (7, 8) , Australia (9), France (10), Japan (11) , Canada (5) and Chile (12) . In the United States, the most prominent strain is CA-MRSA USA300, which possesses the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IVa and the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene. In Canada, USA300 is known as CMRSA-10 and has been the dominant strain since it was first reported in 2004 (13) .",

Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in Universal Transport medium (Copan Diagnostics, USA) to maintain the integrity and viability of the respiratory viruses during transport to the laboratory. Influenza A and B viruses were individually detected using a singleplex real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR to each of these agents. The primers, probes and cycling conditions have been previously described (47) . Testing for the respiratory viruses, ie, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza types 1 to 4 and adenovirus, was performed using the Respiratory Viral Panel assay from Luminex Molecular Diagnostics (Abbott Laboratories, Canada). For patients for whom no NAT was performed and banked paired serum samples were available, stored serum samples were forwarded to the National Medical Laboratory for testing of antibodies to influenza A and B using a hemagglutination inhibition assay performed according to standard techniques (48) .

Vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for all clinical isolates of MRSA using the Vitek II AST-GP67 susceptibility card (bioMerieux Canada). All isolates had minimum inhibitory concentrations <1.0 \u00b5g/mL. Eight patients were tested for viral infection with either NAT or serology. For the other two patients, testing was not performed due to the absence of obtaining a nasopharyngeal specimen or the lack of stored serum samples. Viral testing results are summarized in Table 3 . In eight of 10 patients, documentation supporting the presence of any concomitant viral infection at the time of admission could not be found. At the time of admission, none of the 10 cases had a nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viruses performed.

            "text": "CA-MRSA is increasingly recognized as an emerging pathogen in the community (50) . Severe cases of CA-MRSA necrotizing pneumonia have been reported worldwide in adult and pediatric series (25, 32) . Although previous studies have suggested a relationship between CA-MRSA pneumonia and preceding influenza or other viral respiratory illness (25-27,51) , a viral etiology for community-acquired pneumonia cases is not always investigated (52, 53) . Few studies have considered the role of S aureus in non-influenza-associated pneumonia as outlined by Kallen et al (31) . The results of our case series suggest that severe CA-MRSA pneumonia may occur in the absence of antecedent influenza or other viral respiratory infection. Our findings are corroborated by another recent retrospective analysis, in which 15 cases of CA-MRSA pneumonia were described as having no relationship to a preceding influenza infection (54) . In this study, viral testing was performed on all 15 patients using either the rapid influenza test or influenza viral culture, and only one was positive. Infections due to CA-MRSA have been reported and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality (8, 20, 28, 55) . In our series, this was illustrated by the presence of empyema in seven of 10 patients and the death of two patients. The varying degrees of morbidity in our series included the development of empyema (70.0%), cavitary lesions (80.0%) and ICU admission (50.0%). Our findings showed that the majority of our patients required chest tube placement (70.0%), revealing the virulent capacity of MRSA. The mortality rate was 20.0%, which is comparable with a previously reported case series of CA-MRSA without previous viral infection (54) . In all our cases, MRSA was the only bacterial pathogen identified that was associated with the initial presentation. All 10 of the isolates harboured the PVL gene ( Figure 1 ) and had the SCCmec type IVa element. Our results demonstrate that these isolates were consistent with previously described strains of CA-MRSA (7), of which 80.0% were the North American dominant strain USA300 strain.",

PVL is a cytotoxin that appears to be associated with S aureus causing SSTIs (6) and necrotizing pneumonia (24) . In contrast, a study by Sharma-Kuinkel et al (56) provide evidence that clinical outcome may be more significantly influenced by several bacterial virulence factors and that PVL is not the primary determinant of outcome. Investigators have shown that other factors need to be considered in the pathogenesis of serious infections due to MRSA (57) .",

Clinically, linezolid and vancomycin have shown no significant difference in outcomes (58) while a post hoc analysis in a multicentre study suggested increased survival and cure rates with linezolid (59) . Guidelines by the Canadian Thoracic Society and Canadian Infectious Diseases Society We recognize that our study had several limitations. Selection of patients was limited to those seen by the infectious diseases consultation group and, therefore, not all patients with CA-MRSA may have been identified. It is possible that less severe cases were managed without asking for an infectious diseases consultation. Generally, more severe cases of CA-MRSA are managed in consultation with the infectious disease service; however, we recognize that some cases may not have been reported. In addition, as is local practice in our centres, linezolid is not available unless approved by the infectious diseases service. We do acknowledge that this may represent a selection bias. Our results may be limited due to chart accuracy for documented influenza-like symptoms. We based our selection on the available description of onset of symptoms as detailed in the admission notes. We acknowledge that in some cases there may have been incomplete charting or that only positive findings were noted and that no record of a previous viral-like prodrome or investigations for viral illness does not preclude their presence. The lack of any viral testing for two of our patients did not allow us to fully assess the role of a possible viral infection in these cases. In addition, we acknowledge that we did not test for additional respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses and rhinoenteroviruses, but they were not routinely available at our centre. Nonetheless, in 80% of the patients, viral testing demonstrated no evidence of viral infection based on the available testing.",

Nevertheless, the potential role of preceding influenza or other viral illnesses in the pathogenesis of CA-MRSA pneumonia has been previously described (26, 27, 48) and should always be considered in the historical data of patients presenting with rapidly progressive pneumonic illnesses with known risk factors for CA-MRSA. Given the severity, rapid progression, frequency of empyema and other complications, and high mortality of pulmonary infections associated with CA-MRSA, an awareness of this clinical entity for CA-MRSA, especially in patient groups with known risk factors, is crucial for prompt initiation of empirical antimicrobial therapy.",

M\u00c9THODOLOGIE : Les chercheurs pr\u00e9sentent une s\u00e9rie de cas de pneumonie n\u00e9crosante se manifestant sous forme d'infection ou de coinfection primaire d\u00e9coulant du SARM-ONN, sans manifestation d'IVRS virale ant\u00e9rieure. Ils ont d\u00e9pist\u00e9 les cas en d\u00e9pouillant les dossiers des services de consultation en infectiologie. Ils ont collig\u00e9 les donn\u00e9es cliniques et radiographiques en analysant les dossiers papier et \u00e9lectroniques. Les souches de SARM avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 isol\u00e9es dans les expectorations, le lavage broncho-alv\u00e9olaire, le liquide pleural ou les h\u00e9mocultures et confirm\u00e9es au moyen d'analyses de laboratoire standards. Les souches de SARM \u00e9taient caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es par les tests de susceptibilit\u00e9, l'\u00e9lectrophor\u00e8se sur gel en champ puls\u00e9, le typage du g\u00e8ne spa ou du g\u00e8ne agr ou le typage g\u00e9nomique multilocus.
