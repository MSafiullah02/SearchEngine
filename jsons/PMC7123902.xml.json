As of the end of 2011, the number of HIV-positive people worldwide had reached 34 million. In response to this situation, the United Nations released its 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS. As of 2012, 186 countries or 96 % of United Nations members had submitted a report on their national AIDS-response measures (UNAIDS) [4]. Figure 5.1 indicates the size of HIV-positive populations, showing from left to right the infection rates among adults, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. It is striking that the HIV-positive rate among drug injectors is 22 times higher than among the general population.\n",

The iatrogenic HIV infection scandal refers to a series of cases of infection with the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, caused by the failure to apply safety measures to blood products. Included in these blood products were coagulation-factor products, which are pharmaceuticals effective against hemophilia. The raw material for these products is prepared from the blood of many donors, and the lack of a procedure for virus inactivation left no defense against viral infection. The reported discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981 led to concerns over the risk of infection through blood products, but despite the warnings from many specialists, the use of these products continued and resulted in some 2,000 cases of HIV infection. According to a 1997 White Paper from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, of the 4,028 people with HIV as of February 1997, 1,872 had been infected by blood products. Meanwhile, of the 1,484 people who had developed AIDS symptoms, 641 had been infected by blood products. The reality was that almost half of those with HIV infection were victims of the scandal. This affair raised issues regarding the administration of pharmaceutical approval and licensing by the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and the culpability of the involved organizations and individuals in industry (pharmaceutical manufacturers); in government (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare); and in academia (the AIDS Research Group led by Dr. Z).",

What this means is that even when use of the drugs stops, the progression of the symptoms does not. This is because iatrogenic HIV infection arises not from the drug\u2019s side-effects, as with most other cases of iatrogenic drug damage, but from viral contamination of the blood that is the raw material for the drugs (Osaka HIV) [6]. In the absence of effective therapy, HIV causes a gradual weakening of the immune system, leading to the onset of AIDS. As of July 1998, there had been 493 deaths from iatrogenic HIV infection, while the number infected was 1,434, of whom 631 had developed AIDS. The number of deaths continues to increase. The fact that many children were affected is another distinctive feature of iatrogenic HIV infection, making all the more urgent the task of limiting the damage and developing therapies. Of those affected, 14 % were 10 years old or younger, while 30 % were 15 years or below, and those aged 20 or below accounted for more than half of all victims. This is why, in the first report by the Research Group for Preventive Therapies for People with HIV Infection, the group\u2019s chief researcher, Professor K. Yamada, called iatrogenic HIV infection \u201cone of the greatest medical tragedies of this century\u201d. The group\u2019s report is subtitled The AIDS Scandal [7].",

The coagulation-factor products had a stronger pharmaceutical effect than the cryoprecipitate preparations which were candidate replacements, and, when symptoms became severe, there were apparently cases in which only coagulation-factor products could elicit recovery. Moreover, self-injection of coagulation-factor products by hemophiliacs was authorized in February 1983, offering a greater degree of user-friendliness than cryoprecipitate, which in principle had to be administered in a hospital. As HIV research was less advanced than nowadays, many doctors and patients opted for the immediate benefits of pharmaceutical efficacy and user-friendliness in the face of an unknown future risk, resulting in the unforeseen human-made medical disaster of iatrogenic HIV infection.",

The former Ministry of Health and Welfare had collected information from overseas specialists, but this information was not communicated to medical treatment institutions, patients, or the general public. At the time of the first confirmed case, the Ministry tried to prepare a \u2018soft landing\u2019 for AIDS in Japan. Similarly, so as to avoid panic among the public and unequal treatment of companies, it continued to advocate a softly-softly approach. In court, too, the government went on to adopt the role of director and defender of the accused companies. In addition to this aspect, there was a strong significance attached to the fact that the disease was infectious, which meant that the damage spread through secondary and tertiary infection. Surprisingly, as the Ministry initially treated HIV as a public health and sanitation issue, it did not provide victims with medical treatment, relief or compensation, thinking of the infection rather as a social evil which needed to be rooted out and eliminated.",

Cryoprecipitates products were used as drugs to control the disease [10]. As cryoprecipitate products are made from the pooled blood of one or at the most ten individuals, it was expected that they would be less likely to cause infection than coagulation-factor products, which are made from the pooled blood of between 2,000 and 20,000 people [11]. As the first cryoprecipitate were frozen products, their storage and use presented challenges, and patients had to be treated in hospital, but this problem was resolved by the dried cryoprecipitate developed in the early 1980s, and home treatment using cryoprecipitate did apparently take place in some cases. In countries such as Norway, which actually switched to cryoprecipitate, the rate of hemophiliac HIV infection was kept to low levels, indicating effective decision-making on health policy. This fact casts doubt on the basis of Dr. Z\u2019s statement that \u2018cryoprecipitate is liable to solidification\u2019, and instead points to the difference in drug-price markup as one of the possible reasons why the switch to cryoprecipitate was not realized.",

Infection and onset of symptoms are thus separate phenomena. Although \u2018non-heated products\u2019 may be a cause of HIV infection, they do not act to cause AIDS onset\u201d [12]. AIDS is a disease of immune dysfunction caused by a virus called HIV. In a document published in 1986, Dr. Z maintained that confirmation of AIDS requires three conditions to be fulfilled [13]. The first was infection with the AIDS virus, which could be tested via the presence of antibodies. The second was reduced or insufficient immunocompetence. The fact that this reduction of immunocompetence occurs over time is one of the characteristics of AIDS. For reduced immune function to result in the onset of symptoms can take more than 10 years in many cases, until which time the patient may experience no more than a certain degree of fatigue, with no impairment of everyday activities. This is still one of the features that distinguish HIV infection from the onset of AIDS. The third of Dr. Z\u2019s conditions was opportunistic infection, which appears as a result of weakened immunocompetence in the form of illnesses such as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. As a result, medical treatment following the onset of AIDS consists of a constant battle with opportunistic infections.",

The Ministry thereby clearly neglected its duty to warn patients and the public. As for non-heated products, while most other countries reduced their imports, Japan sought to increase imports and even reduced the price as an incentive. The reason for the import of unsafe \u2018non-heated products\u2019 was quite simply the prioritization of earnings from the markup on the drug price. This is the profit derived from the difference between the fixed domestic price for medical products and the price actually paid to the overseas supplier. The markup on non-heated products was particularly great. With cryoprecipitate products, in contrast, there was almost none. There are also issues associated with the actions of those involved after the danger was realized: even after heated products became available, they failed to urgently recall the non-heated products which they knew to be unsafe. By making false reports to the Ministry of Health and Welfare regarding the dates of market release and recall of non-heated products, the Green Cross Corporation engaged in fraud and misrepresentation compounding the damage, for which it bears a grave \u2018social responsibility.\u2019",

The pharmaceutical regulatory system has been called a \u2018web of vested interests\u2019. The sorting of good medicines from bad is carried out under government guidance through a process known as pharmaceutical inspection, but, paradoxically, there is greater interest vested in bad medicines than in good medicines. Pharmaceutical companies make massive capital investment in drug development and have to adapt to new raw materials and a new production line for each new drug. They need to recoup this investment, and the development of a single drug is thus a kind of venture project that can determine the entire fate of the company.",

It was this network of interests surrounding pharmaceutical regulation that formed the backdrop to the tragedy of iatrogenic HIV infection. Meanwhile, the inspection procedures and clinical studies involved in drug licensing under the government regulatory system require time, something which often stands in the way of delivering medical treatment to patients who need the drug. Indeed, one wonders what the purpose of the government regulatory system is, and whether the clinical studies involved in pharmaceutical inspection have any useful effect.

In court, the basis for the questioning of the Ministry\u2019s responsibility was the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, which was amended in 1979 in response to the SMON (subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy) case. The amendment gave the Ministry the authority to close down the supply of a pharmaceutical where there was the risk of it creating or aggravating a health or safety hazard. At issue was the failure to exercise this authority, in other words negligence on the part of the regulatory authority. Specifically, it can be pointed out, for instance, that Japan lagged behind the United States by 2 years and 4 months in the approval of heated products. This was largely attributable to the coordination of clinical studies by Dr. Z, but another probable issue was the structure whereby the former Ministry of Health and Welfare\u2019s pharmaceutical-licensing operation was dependent on a small number of specialists.

AIDS was first recognized in Japan on March 22, 1985, with the reporting of the case of a male homosexual resident in the United States, which became known as the Juntendo University case. The patient survived for 10 years after diagnosis, and, although infected with HIV, is thought to have been yet to develop AIDS at that time. In contrast, a hemophiliac who died in July 1983, known as the Teikyo University case, was not recognized as an AIDS patient. It has been claimed that this was because the former Ministry of Health and Welfare tried to conceal the fact of hemophiliac HIV infection. Even subsequent to the licensing of heated products, the Ministry exacerbated the damage by failing to order pharmaceutical manufacturers to recall unheated products. Underlying this lax leadership is a readily perceptible collusion between the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and the pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Green Cross Corporation of those days was described as an outpost of the Ministry of Health and Welfare\u2019s Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau, and the practice of amakudari, whereby officials from the Ministry frequently retired into sinecure positions with pharmaceutical manufacturers, led to the formation of strong collusive relationships in the area of pharmaceutical approval and licensing (Mainichi Shimbun Shakaibu) [14].",

At a time when there were doubts over the safety of blood products, a grave responsibility attaches to his decisions not to switch to cryoprecipitate products, and then to delay the clinical study of the heated products when he should have been working to provide a safer drug as quickly as possible.

Meanwhile, the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau was created to oversee the broad range of safety measures relating to medical treatment and pharmaceuticals, such as pharmaceutical clinical studies, approval and inspection, post-marketing safety measures, and measures to prevent infection within medical-treatment institutions. In parallel, as part of a strategic upgrade and reorganization of testing and research institutions, the National Institute of Hygienic Sciences was reconstituted as the National Institute of Health Sciences, and was equipped with a Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center to promote survey and research work on the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs and strengthen pharmaceutical inspection. To coincide with the reorganization, there was a systematic increase in the number of staff assigned to pharmaceutical inspection work, and the inspection system was changed: whereas previously the actual work of inspection had been delegated to the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council, whose members were drawn from the outside, the core work of pharmaceutical inspection was now to be carried out in-house by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center, with the Council\u2019s role specialized to cover high-level assessment.

In future, lessons must be drawn from the iatrogenic HIV infection, and reform must be applied to the web of interests in the pharmaceutical industry and its system of cozy collusive relationships with government agencies. The poor practice and collusive relationships arising from the network of interests linking the worlds of industry and government also exemplify the need to reform, in terms of both policies and systems, the ethos and culture which became entrenched during Japan\u2019s earlier period of rapid economic growth. An existing organizational culture must not be allowed to prevent the organization from learning to find its way in a new age. Dismantling the old culture of the past and creating a new culture is an important process.

There are fears of epidemics of the three major infectious diseases (AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis) arising from the \u2018biological hazard\u2019 caused by the world population explosion to 7.2 billion. The particular danger of biological hazard is its exponential pattern of spread. Explosive damage arises through bacterial and viral infection via living organisms, person-to-person infection, or cross-species infection, for example from cattle to humans through bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (vCJD), and foot-and-mouth disease. Moreover, rubella infection in pregnant women may cause cataracts and glaucoma, congenital heart disease, hearing impairment, and other conditions in the fetus, while congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) poses the risk of damage to the next generation. Whether this is regarded as a case of human-made or natural selection, the result is the same: the disaster leads to an indivisible resonance phenomenon, the negative interaction of which causes the accelerated spread of \u2018unsafety\u2019.",

In particular the recent prevalence of Dengue-fever, whose incidence has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years, means that over 100 countries are threatened by the growth of the domain of infection (WHO) [17]. Figure 5.6 shows areas with high risk of Dengue-fever infection as of 2011. The lines to the north and south of the figure indicate the minimum temperature of 10 \u00b0C delineating the habitat limit of the mosquito that transmits the Dengue-fever virus. Advancing northward like an army, global warming is extending the habitat of the mosquitoes that transmit tropical viruses and is pushing the infection toward the northern hemisphere, which has a large land mass and is home to a large proportion of the human race. This poses a threat to the populations of these areas, who have no experience of or resistance to tropical viruses, diehard by global-warming.\n",

Already, it is reported that the 1991 El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon in South America has led to sharp year-on-year increases in cholera cases.
