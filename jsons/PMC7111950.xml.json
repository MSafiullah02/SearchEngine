A fifth species, Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV), has been proposed (Towner et al., 2008). Outbreaks of ZEBOV, SEBOV, CIEBOV, BEBOV and MARV occur sporadically in Africa and are associated with case-fatality rates of up to 90%. In contrast, REBOV has been detected in pigs in the Philippines and seems to be apathogenic in humans (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011, Hartman et al., 2010).",

            "text": "EBOV and MARV bear a single glycoprotein (GP) in their envelope which mediates infectious viral entry into host cells and constitutes an important target for prevention and therapy. Many glycoproteins related to the EBOV-GP, like the HIV envelope protein (Env), are synthesized as inactive precursor proteins in the constitutive secretory pathway of infected cells and require activation by host cell proteases to transit into an active form (Bertram et al., 2010b). Both EBOV-GP and HIV Env are cleaved by furin in the Golgi apparatus of infected cells (Hallenberger et al., 1997, Volchkov et al., 1998) and cleavage at the furin consensus site is essential for HIV infectivity (McCune et al., 1988). In contrast, GP cleavage by furin is dispensable for EBOV spread in cell culture and in animals (Neumann et al., 2002, Neumann et al., 2007, Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1999), indicating that furin does not activate GP. Work by Chandran et al. (2005) and subsequent studies (Kaletsky et al., 2007, Schornberg et al., 2006) suggest that ZEBOV-GP is activated by the pH-dependent cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (termed cathepsins B/L in the remainder of the manuscript) upon viral entry into host cell endosomes. In addition, a link between \u03b15\u03b21 integrin expression, cathepsin B/L activity and GP-mediated entry has been revealed (Schornberg et al., 2009), in line with a previous report indicating that \u03b21 integrins promote EBOV-GP-dependent host cell entry (Takada et al., 2000). However, it is at present unclear if all EBOV species and MARV are comparably dependent on cathepsin B/L activity for viral entry and it is unknown if cathepsin B/L activity is required for GP-driven entry into macrophages, central target cells of filoviruses.",

These findings and the observation that TMPRSS2 is expressed by type II pneumocytes, major viral target cells (Glowacka et al., 2011, Matsuyama et al., 2010), suggest that inhibition of cathepsin B/L activity might not appreciably reduce viral spread in infected patients.

For several of these inhibitors, we determined their activity against cathepsins B, L and S in 293T cells, employing inhibitor concentrations subsequently used for infection experiments. CA074, a cathepsin B inhibitor (Sigma), potently blocked cathepsin B activity, as expected, but at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM also reduced cathepsin L activity by about 70% (Fig. 1\n). CA074Me, a CA074 derivative with high membrane permeability (Calbiochem), exhibited activity similar to CA074 at the concentrations tested. Notably, CA074Me was previously shown to inhibit cellular entry of ecotropic murine leukemia virus via inhibition of cathepsin L, demonstrating that the modest activity of CA074Me against cathepsin L (Fig. 1) can be sufficient to exert antiviral effects (Yoshii et al., 2009). Cathepsin L inhibitor III, an irreversible inhibitor of cathepsin L (Merck), was highly active against cathepsin L but, unexpectedly, also inhibited cathepsin B with similar efficiency (Fig. 1). AEBSF, a serine protease inhibitor (Roth), displayed no activity against cathepsins B and L. E64c, a cysteine protease inhibitor (Sigma), fully inhibited cathepsin B and reduced cathepsin L activity by half when applied at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM (Fig. 1). None of the inhibitors tested were active against cathepsin S, indicating a substantial level of selectivity, although inhibition of other cysteine cathepsins, like cathepsins H, K and O, has not been tested. Finally, leupeptin, a well characterized inhibitor of serine and cysteine proteases (Aoyagi et al., 1969), and MDL 28170, an efficient inhibitor of cathepsin B activity (Mehdi, 1991), cathepsin L activity (Simmons et al., 2005) and SARS-S driven host cell entry (Simmons et al., 2005), were also included in the panel.",

            "text": "Cathepsins B and L were previously shown to activate ZEBOV-GP for host cell entry (Chandran et al., 2005). In order to address if the GPs of different EBOVs are activated differentially by host cell proteases, we compared activation of GP derived from ZEBOV and REBOV, which exhibit differential pathogenicity in humans (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011). For this, we employed infectivity-normalized HIV-derived vectors pseudotyped with ZEBOV- and REBOV-GP for infection of 293T target cells that were either pretreated with protease inhibitor (Fig. 2\n, gray and black bars) or inhibitor solvent as control (white bars). Particles bearing no GP (Fig. 2, pcDNA3) or the G-protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) were used as controls. AEBSF treatment of target cells had no effect on entry of all pseudotypes tested (Fig. 2A, upper panel, right), while leupeptin inhibited ZEBOV- and REBOV-GP-dependent entry (Fig. 2A, upper panel, left), indicating that cysteine but not serine proteases are involved in EBOV-GP activation. MDL28170 and E64c both inhibited ZEBOV- and REBOV-GP-driven entry, in agreement with the concept that cathepsins B/L can activate EBOV-GP (Fig. 2A, lower panel). However, the relative importance of cathepsins B and L for activation of these glycoproteins might differ, since cathepsin L inhibitor III (Table 1), which displayed the highest activity against cathepsin L of all compounds tested, inhibited cell entry driven by both ZEBOV- and REBOV-GP, while the largely cathepsin B-specific inhibitor CA074 (Table 1) was active only against ZEBOV-GP (Fig. 2B). Finally, CA074Me, which reduced cathepsin B activity by about 99.9% and cathepsin L activity by about 70% at a concentration of 4 \u03bcM (Fig. 1), inhibited entry driven by the GPs of all EBOV species, although with different efficiencies (Fig. 2C), suggesting that cathepsin B and potentially also cathepsin L dependence for host cell entry is conserved between EBOV-GPs. In sum, these results indicate that efficient cellular entry driven by the GPs of the EBOV species depends on the activity of cathepsins B and/or L, while the relative contribution of both enzymes to GP activation might vary between the EBOV species.",

These results suggest that MARV-GP is indeed less dependent on cathepsin B/L activity for entry into 293T cells when compared to EBOV-GP. However, leupeptin but not AEBSF robustly and invariably suppressed host cell entry driven by MARV-GP (Fig. 3), demonstrating that MARV-GP like EBOV-GP depends on activation by host cell proteases for infectious entry, and the nature of the responsible protease(s) remains to be defined.",

            "text": "The S-protein of SARS-CoV is also activated by cathepsins B and L (Simmons et al., 2005). However, the dependence on cathepsin activity is markedly reduced if target cells express the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 (Glowacka et al., 2011, Matsuyama et al., 2010, Shulla et al., 2011). We next addressed if TMPRSS2 and the related protease hepsin modulate cathepsin-dependence of EBOV-GP for host cell entry. For this, we coexpressed EBOV-GPs with a C-terminal V5 tag and TMPRSS2 or hepsin in 293T cells and analyzed GP cleavage by Western blot. All GPs were cleaved in the absence of TTSP expression (Fig. 4\n), in agreement with the previously published finding that GP is proteolytically processed by furin (Volchkov et al., 1998), an ubiquitously expressed pre-protein convertase active in the 293T cell line used for GP expression in the present study (Bush et al., 2001, Yano et al., 2009). However, cleavage efficiency differed between the GPs analyzed: ZEBOV- and SEBOV-GP were efficiently cleaved while cleavage of CIEBOV- and REBOV-GP was inefficient (Fig. 4). Notably, the inefficient cleavage of REBOV-GP was rescued by hepsin coexpression, and TMPRSS2 coexpression allowed efficient cleavage of both REBOV- and CIEBOV-GP. Thus, hepsin and TMPRSS2 might activate REBOV- and/or CIEBOV-GP for host cell entry. However, coexpression of neither protease in virus producing cells (Fig. 5\nA) or in viral target cells (Fig. 5B) allowed efficient GP-driven entry into cells pretreated with a cathepsin B/L inhibitor, while TMPRSS2 was able to partially rescue blockade of SARS-S-driven infection (Fig. 5C), as expected (Glowacka et al., 2011, Matsuyama et al., 2010, Shulla et al., 2011). These results suggest that TMPRSS2 and hepsin cannot functionally replace cathepsin B/L activity in EBOV target cells.",

Incubation of macrophages with CA074Me and leupeptin inhibited entry driven by ZEBOV- and REBOV-GP but not VSV-G (Fig. 6\n). In contrast, only leupeptin but not CA074Me efficiently reduced MARV-GP-dependent infection (Fig. 6) and AEBSF had no effect (data not shown), indicating that MARV might employ other cellular proteases in addition to or instead of cathepsins B and L for entry into macrophages.",

Whether the same holds true for EBOV has long been unclear, since cleavage at a furin consensus site in EBOV-GP was found to be dispensable for infectivity (Neumann et al., 2002, Neumann et al., 2007). Recent findings demonstrated that the endo-/lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin L and particularly cathepsin B can activate ZEBOV-GP (Chandran et al., 2005, Schornberg et al., 2006), indicating that proteolytic activation of EBOV occurs upon viral uptake into host cells. Interestingly, proteolysis of GP by cathepsins B/L seems to be required for engagement of the endosomal membrane protein Niemann\u2013Pick C1, which is essential for infectious filovirus entry (Carette et al., 2011, Cote et al., 2011). Here, we show that the GPs of all EBOV subspecies depend on cathepsin B/L activity for viral entry into 293T cells, although to different degrees. Similarly, EBOV-GP-driven infection of macrophages required cathepsin B/L activity. In contrast, MARV-GP-driven entry was largely cathepsin B/L-independent and was promoted by so far uncharacterized host cell proteases. Finally, TMPRSS2 and hepsin, members of the TTSP family known to activate SARS-CoV and influenza viruses (B\u00f6ttcher et al., 2006, Glowacka et al., 2011, Matsuyama et al., 2010, Shulla et al., 2011), were able to cleave EBOV-GP but were unable to support GP-dependent, cathepsin B/L-independent host cell entry.",

Our results demonstrate that the GPs of all four EBOV species depend on cathepsin B/L-activity for host cell entry. Sensitivity of ZEBOV-GP to inhibition by CA074Me was highest of all GPs tested, suggesting that ZEBOV-GP might be particularly dependent on activation by cathepsins B/L. It needs to be noted that CA074Me was more than 200-fold more active against cathepsin B compared to cathepsin L at the highest concentration used (4 \u03bcM), and the inhibitory effects observed in infection experiments might thus mainly stem from cathepsin B blockade. The dependence on the individual activities of cathepsin B and cathepsin L might vary between ZEBOV- and REBOV-GP, with the latter being insensitive to inhibition by CA074 but sensitive to blockade by cathepsin L inhibitor III. The reasons for these differences are at present unknown, but might relate to differences in the cathepsin B/L target sites. Cathepsin L cleavage sites in ZEBOV-GP have recently been proposed (Hood et al., 2010) and their sequences indeed differ between ZEBOV- and REBOV-GP. Moreover, Wong and colleagues selected EBOV-GP variants with amino acid changes, which allow entry into cells treated with a cathepsin B inhibitor, and some of the respective amino acids are not conserved between EBOV species (Wong et al., 2010). Alternatively, some GPs might be intrinsically more amenable to proteolysis than others and might thus exhibit a different requirement for cathepsin activity.",

These results are in agreement with a previous study showing that inhibition of cathepsin B/L efficiently blocked ZEBOV but not MARV entry into Vero E6 cells, although inhibition of viral replication was observed (Sanchez, 2007). In contrast, Huang and colleagues reported that engineered expression of cathepsin L in murine cathepsin L knock-out cells increased MARV-GP-mediated entry (Huang et al., 2006). The reasons for these discrepant results are at present unclear. Our observations suggest that MARV does either not require proteolytic activation of its GP for entry or that MARV and EBOV rely on different host cell proteases to ensure their activation. The finding that leupeptin, an inhibitor of cysteine and serine proteases, blocked MARV-GP-driven entry indicates that the latter is the case, but the responsible protease(s) remain(s) to be defined.",

Recent studies demonstrate that several of these proteins might also promote viral infections by facilitating activation of viral glycoproteins. Thus, TMPRSS2 was shown to activate influenza virus (B\u00f6ttcher et al., 2006), human metapneumovirus (Shirogane et al., 2008) and SARS-CoV (Glowacka et al., 2011, Matsuyama et al., 2010, Shulla et al., 2011). The latter finding is remarkable, because it has previously been reported that SARS-CoV relies on cathepsins B and L for its activation (Simmons et al., 2005). The observation that cathepsin B/L-dependence is abrogated by TMPRSS2 suggests that virions are activated by TMPRSS2 during contact with the plasma membrane of target cells and then reach endo-/lysosomes, which contain cathepsins B and L, in an already activated from. Our results show that TMPRSS2 and the related protease hepsin can cleave REBOV- and/or CIEBOV-GP, potentially at the same site as furin. ZEBOV-GP and SEBOV-GP are presumably also cleaved by TMPRSS2 but cleavage could not be demonstrated because of the efficient processing of these proteins by endogenous furin in 293T cells (Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1999). However, cleavage by TMPRSS2 and hepsin did not result in GP activation and cathepsin B/L-independent cellular entry, in agreement with previous findings indicating that the furin cleavage site is dispensable for viral spread and pathogenicity (Neumann et al., 2002, Neumann et al., 2007). Thus, unlike the situation noted for SARS-CoV, TTSPs are unlikely to rescue EBOV from the antiviral effect of therapeutically applied cathepsin B/L-inhibitors.",
