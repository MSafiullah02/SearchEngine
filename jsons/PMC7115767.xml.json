However, building occupants are not isolated from its neighborhood environment. Buildings serve not only to shelter occupants from adverse outdoor environment and weather; but also bring favorable natural elements, such as natural lighting and fresh air, into occupants' work and life. Permeability is one of the key features in any buildings (e.g., [55]. It is this permeability nature which puts occupants of a building and its neighborhood environment into connection. Therefore, the impact of neighborhood environment is a key factor which cannot be overlooked when studying occupant health and indoor environment.",

Hence, this study goes beyond indoor environment to identify what neighborhood environment factors affect occupant health and indoor environment quality; investigate the influence of these neighborhood environment factors on occupant health; and to examine the impact and interplay of indoor building environment and neighborhood environment on health of building occupants.

Previous studies have indicated that poor IAQ can cause bronchoconstriction, asthma symptoms, lung cancer, irritation to eyes, visibility problems, headaches, dizziness and even fatal poisoning in occupants (e.g., [19,50].

Extreme light levels can cause eye health problems to building occupants [24], however, its impact can be reduced if a building is equipped with an effective design strategy and lighting system, such as the adoption of fa\u00e7ade design with visible light transmittance glazing and smart lighting system with light sensors, which enhance occupants' visual comfort (e.g., [32,39].",

In developed cities, like Hong Kong, transport noise, such as road traffic and railway noise, is the major source of noise affecting building occupants [38]. In this case, neighborhood buildings can act as obstructions to the free propagation of noise from street and road traffic, attenuating its sound level [21]. In current study, since the two Group 2 buildings are located right next to two main roads, with the absence of neighborhood buildings serving as sound obstructions, Group 2 buildings are found to have higher noise levels than that of Group 1 buildings. Enhancing sound insulation level of a building can reduce the level of sound energy emitted from the neighborhood environment entering its inner space, thus, enhancing occupant acoustic comfort and relieving the significant impact of outdoor noise to occupants.",

The intimate and intertwining relationships between neighborhood environment, indoor environment and occupant health are not clear. Further developed from the results of these previous studies, the current study provides empirical support on the extended effects of neighborhood environment, when interacting with indoor environment, on occupants' health. The findings, to certain extent, indicate that consideration of indoor environment alone does not guarantee a better indoor environment, nor better occupant health. This sheds light to the importance of taking neighborhood environment and its interaction with respective indoor environment indicators into account in building assessment process.",

The associations between acoustic comfort and occupant health are found to be affected by neighborhood building density. Even though neighborhood building density can somehow reflect the traffic condition nearby, traffic flow has long been identified as the major source of noise for building occupants.

The results lay solid platform on the importance of taking neighborhood environment into considerations during building design and assessment stages. Furthermore, the study results also push forward the development of academic research in the field. Researchers have conducted various studies on the impact of indoor environment quality on occupant satisfaction and health. However, evidence to this effect has been inconsistent. This study goes beyond indoor environment to develop the concept of outdoor and indoor environment interaction for revealing the intertwining relationships between neighborhood environment, indoor environment, and health of occupants.",
