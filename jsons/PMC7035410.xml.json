It is a non-invasive, radiation-free tool to monitor, in real-time and at the bedside, the distribution of pulmonary ventilation [3\u201311]. Subjecting the patient\u2019s chest to minute electrical currents, EIT measures the electric potentials at the chest wall surface to produce two-dimensional (2D) images that reflect the impedance distribution within the thorax. Cyclic variations in pulmonary air and blood content are the major determinants for the changes in thoracic impedance. Because cyclic changes in local impedance mainly correspond to changes in lung aeration, EIT can reliably assess imbalances in the distribution of regional ventilation [3, 4, 11, 12]. Besides other features like portability and the possibility of around-the-clock monitoring, the high temporal resolution (modern EIT devices generate up to 50 images per second) is another important aspect of this imaging method, which also allows the study of rapid physiological phenomena, such as the regional perfusion [13].",

During the lavages, mechanical ventilation was set in pressure-controlled mode, with FIO2 1.0, RR 30, PEEP 5, and a driving pressure resulting in a VT of 6 ml/kg.

It is expressed as the percentage of total pulmonary ventilation through each of the three ROIs (total 100%).Perfusion maps obtained by injecting a bolus of 10 ml of a hypertonic solution (NaCl 10%) into a central venous catheter during an expiratory breath hold for 20 s. Due to its high conductivity, NaCl 10% acts as an EIT contrast agent [16], which after injection into the right atrium during apnea passes through the pulmonary circulation, thereby producing a dilution curve that follows typical first-pass kinetics. The resulting regional impedance curves are then analyzed to quantitatively assess regional perfusion [13, 17, 18], expressed as the percentage of total pulmonary blood flow through each of the three ROIs (total 100%).",

Notwithstanding, when analyzing the effects of PEEP and VT on regional perfusion, airspaces collapse did not seem to play a major role.

Our findings on regional ventilation may be interpreted as predominantly gravity-related, since the ventilation of the more dependent region exhibited a greater increase in its percentage with increasing VT and PEEP in the injured group than in the control one. On the other hand, our findings on regional perfusion, where all regions were altered and the presence or not of lung injury did not have an effect, suggest that VT and PEEP interacted all over the lung parenchyma on the redistribution of regional perfusion to the dependent zones [20, 21], also in agreement with pulmonary blood volume tidal redistribution [22].",

The greatest determinant of pulmonary blood perfusion distribution is the difference between alveolar and pulmonary capillary pressures [28]. Perfusion increases down the gravitational gradient in the lung, due to hydrostatic forces and structural factors. Atelectasis is pronounced in the dependent lung regions, where perfusion of non-ventilated lung parenchyma produces a shunt effect of around 8\u201310% of cardiac output in healthy lungs [24], and a greater shunt in injured lungs. In addition, non-gravitational inhomogeneity of perfusion can reduce arterial blood oxygenation. Elevated airway pressures applied to the lung during mechanical ventilation can compromise venous return and redirect blood flow to dependent lung regions, with the effect being more marked at higher levels of PEEP and/or VT [29]. Our data demonstrate that these effects can be regionally monitored, measured, and tracked in real-time and at the bedside by EIT.",

            "text": "The main limitation of our study may be in the animal model that is not capable of reproducing all of the key characteristics of lung injury in humans, for example in ARDS patients, where EIT titration of MV may be most helpful. Any animal model is relevant for only limited aspects of ARDS pathophysiology. However, if the specific characteristics of an animal model are carefully taken in account, and its findings are interpreted in the context of the study limitations, animal investigations can provide valid assessments of relevant elements of ARDS in human patients. The surfactant depletion by saline lavage model was developed based on the observation that ARDS is associated with depletion of surfactant from the air spaces and reduced concentrations of surfactant-associated proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [32]. However, determining precisely the extent to which the lung injury is caused by the saline lavage, by mechanical ventilation, or both remains challenging. Depletion of surfactant may be associated with lung injury via two mechanisms: greater lung collapse and increased likelihood of mechanical injury during repeated cycles of airspaces opening/closure, and impaired alveolar host defenses. Characteristically, saline lavage leads to almost immediate hypoxemia, which may be rapidly reversed by recruitment maneuvers, suggesting that the gas exchange abnormalities reflect collapsed alveoli with otherwise intact alveolar walls. The saline lavage by itself has little consequence in terms of permeability changes or inflammation [33], although TNF-alpha is detectable in lavage fluid. Despite surfactant depletion being an important feature of ARDS in humans, it usually appears as a consequence rather than the primary cause of lung injury [34]. In ARDS, surfactant abnormalities occur because of injury to the alveolar epithelium and exudation of protein-rich edema fluid into the alveolar spaces. Saline lavage of the lungs results in surfactant depletion in the absence of major alveolar epithelial damage. Epithelial damage occurs only when the saline lavage is followed by an injurious ventilatory strategy. Therefore, surfactant depletion followed by mechanical ventilation simulates established ARDS and provides information about the consequences of surfactant depletion, but it is less useful in modeling the initial pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to ARDS. The major advantage of the saline lavage model is that it provides an ideal way to test the effects of different ventilatory strategies on the development of lung injury [33].",

The regional time-impedance curves resulting from 10% NaCl injection [16, 35, 36] were fitted on a pixel-by-pixel basis by a gamma-variate function to quantitatively assess regional perfusion [17, 18]. The subtraction of the cardiac component of perfusion from mixed pixels while maintaining the net lung component by using an EIT gamma variate algorithm is an essential feature of this method. Such was made possible by the fitting also of the early cardiac component, also on a pixel-by-pixel basis by a corresponding gamma-variate function. However, at the edges of the heart, some challenging overlap between the behavior of lung and heart tissue may have remained, sometimes causing uncertainties in the double-function fitting process applied. Although the location of the cardiac chambers in humans could make this differentiation easier in the clinical setting, more studies on this subject are needed.",
