Data collection was through interview using structured questionnaire, physical examination, throat swabs for bacterial culture and nasal swabs for virus identification by immunofluorescence (IF) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Additional PCR was performed on a subsample of 100 patients. Patients were followed-up until resolution of symptoms.",

Triggers ranging from self-perception to socio-economic factors can influence a person's decision to legitimize his sick role. Yet, in spite of this, recommendations for treatment of URTI in many clinical guidelines are based on results of community studies.",

To our knowledge, there is a paucity of such studies conducted in general practices. Lieberman et al. conducted a practice-based study on 122 patients in three general practices in Israel. They used increase in antibody titre in paired sera for identification of an infective cause, and reported a viral pathogen in 25%, bacterial in 30% and more than one pathogen in 22% of patients. 7 With the advent of new laboratory methods such as immunofluorescence (IF) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), it has been possible to improve the rate of virus identification. The main objective of our study was therefore to determine the aetiological cause in patients who presented with acute respiratory symptoms in nine primary care clinics in Singapore, using bacterial culture, IF and PCR. We also aimed to study the differences in clinical presentation between patients with different aetiological causes.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first practice-based study on the aetiological diagnosis of a large group of patients presenting with URTI in primary care clinics in Asia, using IF and PCR as identification methods. We found that an infective aetiology was present in only 51% of patients. Of these, 47% were viral infections, and 4% were bacterial or mixed bacterial and viral infections. The proportion of patients in whom no infective cause could be found was higher than that found in community studies. In the Tecumseh Study, this was 23%, 6 even without newer methods of virus isolation. In a study among university students, with the use of IF, PCR and serology, no pathogen could be identified in 30% of subjects. 4 We examined the following factors in the study methodology that might have contributed to the high proportion of patients in whom no pathogen could be detected. First, the adequacy of sample collection. All samples were collected by the authors, or by qualified staff nurses who had been trained in the technique by the authors. Although nasopharyngeal aspirates were used in some studies, 4 we chose nasopharyngeal swabs for two reasons. Nasopharyngeal aspiration is the optimal sampling method with respect to viral culture, but there were not enough studies on aspirate versus swab for IF and PCR, and most sampling studies have been conducted in children. In our pilot study in adults in a clinic setting, we found in fact that aspirates gave a poor yield of cells for virus identification, whereas swabs yielded sufficient cells for IF. By extension, swabs should then be satisfactory, if not better, for PCR. In the main study, we noted that adequate cells were seen in almost all samples after processing the specimens for IF. A second factor was the choice of pathogens looked for and the methods for their identification. The pathogens detected by respiratory virus IF (RSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, adenovirus) were the usual ones detected in clinical laboratories. For the pathogens covered by IF, the sensitivity and specificity are comparable with virus culture. 15 Virus culture was not performed in this study due to budget constraints. Virus culture may increase the detection rate although, in general, the yield will not be significantly higher. 15 However, with appropriate cell lines, virus culture may pick up rhinoviruses and enteroviruses-two pathogens which are not detectable by routine IF. We addressed this limitation by performing PCR instead. PCR has been shown to be more sensitive than culture and IF. 16 It is possible that virus culture may also pick up hitherto uncharacterized viruses, but this is quite rare. An example would be the recent characterization of human metapneumoviruses. 17 With further PCR, we have covered most of the known viruses causing URTI, except for human metapneumoviruses.",

Taking two or more throat swabs would increase the sensitivity of culture, but this was not practical. In addition, the increased yield by double sampling is limited (90-96% using one swab compared with 100% using two swabs). 18 We believe that the study does reflect the relative paucity of group A streptococci in our community. Low carriage of group A streptococci has also been shown in other communities. 19 We did not use paired sera, as used by Lieberman et al., due to logistic constraints. It is possible that additional cases may have been picked up by serology. However, the use of IF and PCR on acute phase specimens would be expected to detect the pathogens targeted.
