Heterogeneity in the variations of relative risk (RR) in space and time was found to be associated with mosquito factors, including mosquito feeding cycle, host-seeking behavior, and life span of mosquitoes. Particularly, higher RR values were more likely to be identified in the time periods and areas with shorter temporal and spatial distances (Figure 10 -5a) and more clear suspected/confirmed dengue clusters were detected in shorter time distances (Figure 10-5b) . In addition, confirmed dengue cases showed more clear higher risk (in red color) than suspected dengue cases, illustrating the importance of laboratory diagnosis. The cluster analysis also proved that the probability of observing a dengue case outside of 100 m around the dengue foci, a distance measured to correspond to a statistical threshold, was low. However, this threshold could vary if the case numbers increased with the improved surveillance system. By contrast, Taiwan's GIS analysis of confirmed dengue cases showed that the relocation diffusion occurred more frequently as the duration of the epidemic wave in that epidemic site became longer [33] .

Between October 2005 and June 2006, 161 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 occurred in poultry villages of Romania [37] . Using two combined temporal and geostatistical methods, Anselin's local indicator of spatial autocorrelation statistics (LISA) for area-type data and space-time permutation scan statistic for point-type data, the clusters of H5N1 were identified. The former method focuses only on spatial clusters and the latter method simultaneously considers temporal and spatial clusters. The space-time permutation scan statistic method is particularly useful in infectious diseases with shorter incubation period but closely associated with large-scope ecology and also in those situations where the numbers of populations at risk is unknown in syndromic surveillance [18] . The results found that the locations of the clusters were different by using the two different cluster algorithms (Figure 10-7a and b) . The origin, evolution and increasing spread of the epidemic can be grasped more clearly. The outbreak first appeared in the region of the Danube River Delta by the introduction of the virus, implying the importance of landscape epidemiology. Then, the movement of poultry might facilitate its further spread to central Romania the next year. Using the spatio-temporal methods, the progression of the outbreak from a confined, local epidemic extended to a large, nationwide epidemic can be fully understood. Such efforts are very helpful to minimize the spread of the next H5N1 epidemic in other countries and the future global spread of HPAI H5N1 viruses. To summarize the analysis of temporal and spatial clusters for infectious diseases with different modes of transmission, both the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the microbial agents are the key factors to determine the best method to be selected.

Then, the problem of spatial precision or polygon data will make it very hard to investigate the evolution of the outbreak by time and place simultaneously or to search for interesting hypotheses.
