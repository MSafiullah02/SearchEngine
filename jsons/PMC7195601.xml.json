As of 00:00 on March 6, 2020, approximately 98,332 persons have been infected across the world, the figure that has already far exceeded the numbers for SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 (Huang et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2015). Moreover, other than a certain degree of progress in the control and prevention of the epidemic in China, the situations in other countries have deteriorated. Without proper protective measures, COVID-19 may be transmitted through airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing, as well as close contact. Furthermore, air transmission and feces-mouth transmission have not yet been verified, though there are signs that such transmission means are possible (WHO, 2020).",

The enclosed management model employed at most psychiatric hospitals represents a daunting challenge for effective control of infectious disease and thwarting outbreaks within institutions. The Fourth People's Hospital of Chengdu is the ninth most influential hospital in terms of scientific research and one of the largest psychiatric medical care centres in southwest China. We propose the following suggestions and strategies for psychiatric hospitals during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic.",

First, staff should notify patients\u2019 relatives individually, via channels such as phone calls or WeChat, to refuse relatives from visiting a hospital or bringing over food and other items during the ongoing epidemic except for special circumstances. If they want to know the condition of the patient, they can contact the ward by phone. Second, the specific section \"food and item temporary storage\" should be set up outside Wards, and signs to inform visitors info, such as a phone number, should be opened. Patients\u2019 relatives who bring food and other items should contact the ward and wait at the visiting room outside the ward. Nurses should inspect food and items and sanitize the exterior packaging (spraying with alcohol or disinfectant) at temporary storage. During the whole process, nurses should try to avoid direct contact with patients\u2019 relatives. Third, doctors should send a proposal to patients\u2019 relatives to inform them of cancellation of leaving or visiting requests such as Chinese New Year and other holiday seasons, and to suggest communication by phone call or video chat. Fourth, all wards should track movement of all staff (including doctors, nurses, assistant attendants, and janitors) and assess the risk of infection daily. In addition, the ward should arrange staff with infection risk to quarantine at home or quarantine at work. Fifth, based on suggestions from practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), it is advisable to administer TCM herbal fumigation around the clock and prepare TCM preparation for all staff to enhance immunity.",

We must follow the principle \"defense against the import, prevention of internal outbreak\", the health and interest of psychiatric patients and their relatives should be safeguarded to the maximal extent. Therefore, in terms of infection prevention and control at psychiatric hospitals, the actual status of the epidemic should be taken into full account. First, implementation of infection prevention and control must measure at the clinics, emergency rooms and wards where staff may come into direct contact with a patient. Second, it is also necessary to pay attention to infection prevention and control at supplementary divisions and departments that are involved in any step of the process. Third, psychiatric hospitals should assist the community in the management, treatment, and care of people with severe mental disorders at home.",
