Autonomic signs of panic anxiety, vegetative nerve symptoms (such as tachycardia, facial sweating and flushing) are commonly present. Even some patients may show psychotic disorders when illness become quite serious clinically (Li et al., 2020; Neria et al.,2008; Galea et al., 2005; Reinhardt et al., 2020). Although this disease is not uncommon, during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (Coronavirus disease-2019, COVID-19) epidemics and pandemics, the patient neither went to the affected area, nor had contact with infected people, just stayed at home and watched TV news related the number of infected people and daily deaths for a long times, consequently appeared acute stress disorder, which is relatively rare. Two cases of our report are as follow.",

In particular, this disease is highly infectious, spread quickly. And its preclinical period and prevalence is longer and very higher. What is more serious is that the mortality rate of this disease is also quiet higher. In addition, people who are quarantined lose face-to-face connections and traditional social activities, and this may be considered as a real stressful event (Zandifar et al., 2020). In such case, serious concerns, such as fear of death and anxiety emerged in ordinary people, is very common, whereas, the occurrence of serious mental disorders and even with severe behavior disorders is relatively rare. In China\u2019s battle against the novel coronavirus epidemic, all people have shown their powerful will, selfless devotion without hesitation since Lunar New Year. During the epidemic outbreak, most residents are suggested to quarantine at home and keep indoors avoid novel coronavirus infections by the local government. In two cases of our report, after more than 20 days quarantined at home, the patients only saw TV publicity and reports about this disease\u2019s mortality of each day, or only went out for a walk at the residential area, then resulted in fear of deaths, panic anxiety, severe mental and behavior disorders, which was really scarce. Patients mainly showed the fear of coronavirus infection, or thought they had suffered from the coronavirus infection, and wanted to \u201cspit out the virus\u201d, and drunk 75% ethyl acohol \u201cto sterilize\u201d for himself, meanwhile, accompanied by the corresponding behavior disorders, even with impulsively wounding and damaging items. The main cause of the patient's psychiatric symptoms is that the patients were suggested to quarantine at home to avoid novel coronavirus infection, and frequently watched TV news about the reports of higher death rate of infected people every day. And the patient\u2019s thinking contents mainly were around these causes, accompanied by fear, panic anxiety, sweating, and incoordination of emotion and aggressive behavior. This met with the diagnostic criteria of ICD-10 in regard to the diagnostic criteria of acute stress disorder.",

The two cases of patient reported were both older, which was consistent with the reports of Li et al. In addition, the two cases of patient had low educational level, which was also consistent with the research reports of Li et al. (Li et al., 2020) and Tang et al.
