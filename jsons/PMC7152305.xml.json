The etiologic agent eluded investigators until 1976, when a novel virus (Hantaan virus) was isolated from the striped field mouse, Apodemus agrarius, which proved to be the principal viral reservoir in most areas of Asia. Later, a related member of the Bunyaviridae, Seoul virus, was isolated from Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus, explaining the occurrence of sporadic HFRS cases and outbreaks in urban areas. Subsequently, Sin Nombre and related hantaviruses were discovered in the Western hemisphere, where rare encounters with infected rodents lead to small numbers of cases that feature prominent pulmonary involvement. Multitudinous hantaviruses now have been described globally.",

In a randomized controlled three-armed trial, in which vaccinated subjects received three primary doses and a booster dose 1 year later, 15 HFRS cases were observed in 7,860 control subjects compared with none in 7,872 vaccinees and 20 cases in 10,196 unvaccinated subjects during a 48-month follow-up, for a protective efficacy of 100% with a 95% lower confidence limit of 77.9% (P = .00003; cumulative bionomial probability). Efficacy of the primary series alone was shown as, in the year between administration of the primary series and booster dose, 0, 9, and 10 cases occurred in the three groups, respectively. Among 35 cases in the control and unvaccinated groups, 23 were caused by Hantaan virus, 10 by Seoul virus, and 2 by a virus of indeterminate serotype. Thus, the monovalent vaccine was protective against disease caused by the Hantaan and Seoul viral serotypes. No vaccine-related serious adverse event was reported during the trial, and mild local and systemic reactions were reported in 3.78% of subjects.

Immunogenicity of a two-dose primary series in small numbers of human subjects was variable, from 13% to 75% in plaque reduction neutralization tests and 77% to 97% in IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.10 Importantly, in one study, plaque reduction neutralization test titers more than 1:10 persisted in only 14% of subjects 1 year after the primary series; booster immunization led to a rise to more than 1:10 in only 50% of the subjects, and the postbooster GMT (138) was lower than the titer after the second primary dose (203). A serologic correlate of protection has not been established, but these observations suggested the need for a booster dose at 12 months to maintain immunity. The vaccine was well-tolerated with principally local reactogenicity. A case-control study showed a dose-related trend, potentially indicating effectiveness, increasing from 25% (95% confidence interval [CI], \u2212 78% to 68%) after one dose, to 46% (95% CI, \u2212 35% to 78%) after two doses, to 75% (95% CI, \u2212 18% to 95%) after three doses.11 The study evaluated protection through an average of only 7.3 months.",

Their impact is due to the high attack rates resulting in day-care and kindergarten closures and to the cases hospitalized with neurologic and cardiopulmonary complications. Aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and shock can occur with an incidence as high as 15 to 30 per 100,000 in children younger than 5 years, in whom the case-fatality ratio has ranged from 1% to 20%, depending on the definition of a severe case. Brainstem infection, resulting in autonomic dysregulation, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema, but systemic inflammatory responses leading to increased pulmonary vascular permeability and direct injury of the myocardium have not been ruled out as contributing causes. Severe psychomotor damage frequently complicates recovery, with central hypoventilation, motor paralysis, and severe cognitive impairment, with developmental delay occurring in half of children younger than 2 years who experienced cardiopulmonary complications during hospitalization.16 While these rates of death and disability would be significant to parents anywhere, the single child policy in China and similar family structures in Taiwan (having the world's lowest birth rate) and Singapore have focused even more public pressure on governments to control the disease. Rapid vaccine development and priority regulatory approval, analogous to the process for pandemic influenza vaccine, and advance market commitments have been discussed in some countries.",

However, the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN, including Brunei-Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) in 1992 initiated efforts for a subregional regulatory harmonization scheme to reduce differences in technical requirements and regulatory procedures for pharmaceuticals. The harmonization initiative was undertaken under the association's free trade agreement to remove barriers to regional commerce. A Pharmaceutical Product Working Group, formed in 1999, aims to harmonize pharmaceutical regulations of member countries to eliminate technical barriers to trade without compromising product quality, efficacy, and safety. Eventually, a subregional mutual recognition procedure similar to that of the European Union is envisioned. Importantly, local clinical trials are not required for registration under abbreviated pathways specified by the ASEAN Common Technical Dossier if the vaccine was approved and licensed elsewhere by certain benchmark regulatory agencies, resulting in a certificate of pharmaceutical product. By contrast, the national regulatory authorities (NRAs) of China, India, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan have required local clinical trials before or after registration (not unlike the US Food and Drug Administration requirement for a certain proportion of US study subjects in a new submission).",

On the other hand, national schedules in the region can be as comprehensive as to include the human papillomavirus vaccine (Australia) and influenza and varicella vaccines (eg, Korea, Taiwan). At the same time, Hib vaccine still is not recommended in some jurisdictions with high per capita income (Hong Kong, Singapore). To some degree, the seemingly paradoxical recommendations of relatively high income countries in the region reflect different social expectations of personal responsibility in health care purchases (see subsequent text). As shown in Table 69-1, some national schedules provide optional recommendations for some antigens. The availability of inexpensive DTwP-Hib-HepB combination vaccines cannot be highlighted enough, as they have made possible the introduction of Hib antigen into schedules of economically disadvantaged countries that otherwise would not have adopted the monovalent vaccine. As shown in Table 69-1, in many countries where government tenders choose specific manufacturer products, specific combinations are recommended in the national schedule. In addition, for some antigens, provincial-specific recommendations address regional differences in risk (eg, for routine group AC meningococcal vaccine in China; for JE vaccine in Sarawak, Malaysia and for the Torres Straits, Australia; and for rabies vaccine [preexposure] in areas of the Philippines).",

In general, vaccines on national schedules are available at no cost in primary health centers or their equivalent (eg, puskesmas in Indonesia; polyclinics or government hospital clinics in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand; village and county level Centers for Disease Control in China; village communes in Vietnam; public health centers and clinics in India and Japan; and at general practitioner [GP] offices in Australia). As a rule, the cost of vaccines is not reimbursed while they are available free in public clinics, so even in affluent countries, families may attend government clinics or hospitals to obtain routine vaccinations and well-child care (eg, in Singapore, \u2248 60% of families obtain vaccines through the government system of polyclinics and hospitals). However, to avoid long waiting times and rotating staff at public clinics, many families opt to obtain these otherwise free vaccines privately and to pay out-of-pocket at pediatric, GP, or other private clinics. In addition, as newer vaccines may be delayed in their introduction to the national reimbursed scheme, it is common for parents to pay for these vaccines out-of-pocket; for example, in Korea, about 90% of children in Seoul are vaccinated with PCV7 through private purchases. As might be expected from the distribution of income, the proportion of children vaccinated in government primary health centers is higher in rural areas. Overall, approximately 90% of children in Thailand and 70% in Malaysia are vaccinated through public channels. In China, all vaccinations are under control of CDCs; therefore, nearly all Chinese children receive free EPI, as well as payable optional vaccines (eg, Hib, PCV7, varicella, rotavirus, and others) at public clinics. Coverage for EPI vaccines for selected countries is summarized in Figure 69-1\n.30\n",

Between 2005 and 2025, the birth cohort of Asia will decrease slightly from 76.1 to 72.2 million, and the population of children 0 to 4 years old will hold nearly constant while the number and proportion of adults from 15 to 64 years will increase dramatically, and the number of people older than 65 years will nearly double, from 250.6 to 480.6 million. A demographic crossover point with more adults 60 + years than children younger than 15 years, was reached in Europe in the 1990s and will occur within another generation in Asia (Figure 69-2\n).33 With the exception of almost universal EPI programs of tetanus toxoid vaccination of pregnant women, adult vaccination has been viewed mainly in the context of travel, as in group A meningococcal vaccine for the Hajj, and in tropical Asia, influenza vaccine as appropriate only for travelers to temperate locations. However, the SARS and pandemic H1N1 outbreaks and the regional threat of H5N1 influenza have focused attention on routine seasonal influenza vaccination for the first time in many countries, beginning with elderly populations.34 As a result of high pediatric vaccination coverage in developed countries in the region, JE has become almost exclusively a disease of adults older than 45 years, reflecting the intrinsic biological susceptibility of older adults to neurotropic flaviviruses and suggesting a future need for adult vaccination.35 Hepatitis A, interestingly, is now principally a risk in the cohort of young adults who were raised in an era of economic development and improved sanitation and who therefore lack natural immunity but were born before routine childhood vaccination was implemented.36 A catch-up program to fill this demographic \u201chole\u201d has been recognized by adult vaccination recommendations in some countries. In China, adult measles vaccination is under discussion, as more than 100,000 cases have occurred annually in the last 5 years, 26% in adults older than 20 years and 28% in infants who had not received their first vaccine dose; respective proportions in the more economically developed Eastern provinces are 40% and 25%. The growing awareness of adult vaccination is reflected in an increasing number of countries with adult vaccination recommendations (Table 69-3\n).",

Urban crowding is likely to affect the transmission patterns of certain person-to-person transmitted diseases and even of infections acquired from environmental sources. Dengue, for example, is transmitted by mosquito vectors that are more prevalent in urban environments; the already great need for a dengue vaccine will almost certainly increase with the growth of urban centers.38 While the growing size and number of large cities may increase transmission of certain infections, delivery of vaccine and of health care in general is better organized in cities than in rural areas. Specific interventions are needed to ensure that the existing disparity in access to health care between urban and rural dwellers does not widen.",

While vaccines are regarded by many as a public good to be provided as a government service, as mentioned, access to the increasing number of new vaccines is likely to be stratified by income level and ability to pay, as governments must choose among increasingly costly vaccines and other health interventions. As shown in Table 69-1, pediatric societies in a number of countries promulgate recommendations emulating those of the US ACIP, and it is likely that these schedules, aimed at practitioners serving private-paying families, will diverge increasingly from the national EPI schedules benefiting the majority of children in those countries.

Revising and harmonizing guidelines and procedures to international standards and enforcing procedures in a consistent and predictable manner will improve the timely introduction to the region of vaccines developed internationally. As important, compliance with international standards will be required of regional manufacturers hoping to license locally developed vaccines more broadly. As many countries still rely on a certificate of pharmaceutical product, considerable investment in infrastructure and training will be needed for their NRAs to provide full regulatory reviews of new applications. Chinese manufacturers currently export a limited number of vaccines, mainly to African and Latin American countries, but their horizons undoubtedly will expand. Similarly, while nonconformity with international intellectual property conventions has been an obstacle to introducing internationally developed products to some countries in the region, governments and local manufacturers may find themselves taking a stricter view as they themselves develop novel vaccines.",

As resources are unavailable in many countries to establish and maintain a fully functioning national control laboratory, a regional network has been proposed as an approach to share expertise and to divide workload, while at the same time standardizing methods and criteria.
