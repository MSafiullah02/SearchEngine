            "text": "The STING CTD resides in the cytosol and provides a platform that directs TBK1 (tank binding kinase) [6] to phosphorylate and activate IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) [7]. The phosphorylation of IRF3 appears to be a conserved mechanism that selectively recruits IRF3 to activate IFN-I [7]. The activation of STING triggers conformational changes in its CTD, which serves as a platform for the recruitment and auto-phosphorylation of the serine-threonine kinase TBK1. This kinase, in turn, phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor IRF3. IRF3 then travels to the nucleus, where it initiates IFN-I production and directly promotes the expression of multiple ISGs, many of which are activated via the IFN-I \u03b1\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) pathway. The growing interest in STING-mediated DNA responses is based on the importance of IFN-I for the host defenses against DNA viruses, such as herpes viruses, and intracellular bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes. Another subject of interest is the regulation of IFN-I by STING; namely, tight regulation of IFN-I is essential, since excessive production of this cytokine leads to the development of autoimmunity [8\u2022, 9], chronic inflammation [10\u2022\u2022, 11], or sepsis. Not surprisingly, STING is a critical component in tissue repair and tumorigenesis [12].",

Hemizygosity for Tfam (transcription factor a mitochondrial), which encodes an abundant mitochondrial protein responsible for nucleoid maintenance and architecture, keeps the mitochondria intact, but leads to a 50% loss of mtDNA. This results in IRF3 nuclear translocation and elevation of several IFNs and ISGs in a STING-dependent manner.

Although the authors identified the viral protein UL12.5 as responsible for mitochondrial stress induction, it seems counterintuitive that the virus activates an anti-viral mechanism of defense, particularly since numerous other viral homologues of UL12.5 induce mitochondrial stress. It is possible that a synergy exists between mitochondrial stress and induction of other, independent of DNA-damage, immune responses [21], that is, a for potential engagement and cross-talk with other pathways.

Either STING-deficiency or MyD88-deficiency leads to a decrease in IFN-I production and to an increase in mortality in infected mice. The authors show that inflammatory monocytes (iMos) recruited into the dLN are the main producers of IFN-I in response to infection and use STING to activate IRF7 and NF-kB for production of IFN-I. However, it remains to be determined which particular DNA sensor activates STING signaling in iMos. For example, there could be a specialized sensor that stimulates STING in an exclusive manner in these cells. It would also be interesting to see whether STING activates IRF7 directly in iMos or through TLR9-IRF7-STING interaction.",

            "text": "Posttranslational modifications provide additional regulation of STING signaling. For example, IFI16 is a DNA sensor that resides in the nucleus and binds to the sugar-phosphate backbone of dsDNA. The details of how IFI16 moves to the cytosol of infected cells and activates STING have been clarified in a recently published report, which shows that acetylation regulates IFI16 trafficking and DNA binding [23]. A key molecular step is the acetylation of DNA-bound nuclear IFI16 via p300, which decreases DNA-IFI16 binding with the viral genome and expels IFI16 from the DNA, changes its conformation, exposes nuclear import signals, and binds STING in the cytosol. Thus, IFI16 acetylation defines IFI16 location and allows this sensor to switch from BRCA1-assisted [24] binding the viral DNA to interacting with STING. These findings contradict the canonical paradigm that the nucleus is \u2018immune privileged\u2019 with regard to sensing foreign DNA and suggest that both cytoplasmic and nuclear IFI16 participate in viral DNA surveillance.",

In this study, STING co-localized with viral hemagglutinin (HA) and physically interacted with the NTD of the HA fusion protein (FP) via STING's173-163 region. The FP inhibited STING dimerization and translocation in response to the activation of cells with fusogenic liposomes [26\u2022\u2022]. The same team made another exciting discovery when they identified Arg168 of STING to be important in fusion-mediated, but not ligand-induced, IFN-I production, thus functionally separating the two pathways. It is tempting to speculate that another, novel cytosolic component, possibly related to a Ca2+ related membrane perturbation [27\u2022], transduces the activation signal from the lipid membrane to STING. It also suggests that enveloped viruses and fusogenic liposomes both mediate STING-dependent, ligand-independent IFN-I response independently of cGAS; whether this second pathway evolved for better recognition of viruses or enveloped viruses developed additional tools for interfering with the host response remains to be further investigated.",

Now, Lee et al. report the importance of the BTK1 kinase in this activation [33]. BTK1-deficient cells lack phosphorylation of IRF3 and TBK1 and exhibit low levels of IFN-I. According to their model, the DEAD-box domain of DDX41 binds BTK's kinase domain, whereas the SH3/SH2 domain of BTK1 binds the transmembrane domain of STING. BTK1-mediated phosphorylation of DDX41 at Tyr414 increases the affinity of DDX41 towards dsDNA and STING and stabilizes DDX41-STING interactions, thus inducing oligomerization of STING and ultimate activation of TBK1/IRF3 and production of IFN-I. The proposed model suggests that TBK1 functions as an adaptor as well as a kinase. Although a second tyrosine at 364 is critical for the activation of STING, it is not phosphorylated by BTK1, thus leaving its role in STING activation for further investigations.",

The N-terminal (8-pass) transmembrane of SCAP interacts with the transmembrane of STING (1-175), and the C-terminus of SCAP binds IRF3 in an activation dependent mode. SCAP-deficient mice are more sensitive to HSV-1 infection than WT mice. A major question remains as to what initiates the association of SCAP and STING at the ER upon stimulation. It is also still a mystery what regulates the STING/SCAP exit from the ER.",

Now Hansen et al. show [37] that cGAS, STING, and IFI16, but not DDX41, are important for sensing the bacterial DNA, and that it is DNA, rather than Listeria CDNs, that activates the STING-pathway in human myeloid cells. One likely explanation is that human STING is 500 times less responsive to bacterial-derived CDNs with 3\u20325\u2032 linkage than 2\u20323\u2019cGAMP. In addition, humans may have evolved to process DNA better. These data suggest a role for IFI16 in the amplification of cGAS-dependent DNA-driven responses.",

Guo et al. now describe a mechanism by which NLRX1 blocks IFN-I responses and promotes early HIV infection [39]. NLRX1 facilitates its effect via binding the C-terminus of STING, which disrupts the STING-TBK1 interaction. The fact that NLRX1 resides in the mitochondria, whereas STING is located in the ER, challenges these findings. Furthermore, previously observed interactions between mitochondrial and ER proteins do not provide the reason for interaction between mitochondrial and ER proteins. One possibility might be that STING-signaling is specifically prohibited in MAMs (mitochondria associated membrane) and gets disrupted once STING accidently translocates to the mitochondria. Thus, the described negative regulation of STING by NLRX1 could be restricted to certain cellular compartments.",

Finally, the authors determined that TRIM9s has E3 ligase activity and is able to auto-ubiquitinate itself in order to recruit TBK1 and GSK3\u03b2. The negative effect of TRIM9s on IL6 and TNF-activation is likely to be linked to GSK3\u03b2 and could be confirmed by analysis of IL-10 production, which is promoted by GSK3\u03b2.",

When overexpressed, ORF52 inhibited cGAS and IRF3 dimerization [45]. Because the inhibitory effect of ORF52 was attenuated by increased amounts of the DNA, this suggested that ORF52 competes with cGAS for DNA. ORF52 inhibited STING-mediated responses, but not AIM2-mediated responses. The inhibitory effect was specific for DNA, but not RNA-viruses, which altogether supported direct interaction between ORF52 and cGAS. Indeed, the authors mapped the region of ORF52 responsible for binding cGAS. Ability of ORF52 to bind both DNA and cGAS provides high specificity of the inhibitory effect. The rationale behind the strategy used by herpes viruses is that DNA accounts for 10\u201320% of their mass, thus making it necessary for the virus to develop a mechanism that prevents recognition of DNA. This is particularly true for KSHV, which goes through lytic cycles that release viral DNA into the cytosol. Interestingly, ORF52-deficient virus showed little difference in elicited IFN-response compared with the wild type strain, suggesting redundancy in the inhibitory effects of KSHV ORFs on IFN-I production.",
