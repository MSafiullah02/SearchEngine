Despite rapid ongoing progress in vaccinology, there remain many obstacles to the development and deployment of novel or improved vaccines; these include the underlying science of how to induce and sustain appropriate protective immune responses as well as bureaucratic, logistic and socio-political hurdles. The failure to distribute and administer existing vaccines to at-risk communities continues to account for a large proportion of infant mortality worldwide: almost 20 million children do not have access to basic vaccines and several million still die each year as a result. While emerging epidemic or pandemic diseases pose a significant threat to global health and prosperity, there are many infectious diseases which provide a continuous or cyclical burden on healthcare systems which also need to be addressed. Gaps in knowledge of the human immune system stand in the way of developing technologies to overcome individual and pathogenic variation. The challenges in tackling infectious disease and directions that the field of preventive medicine may take to improve the current picture of global health are the focus of this review.",

There is no doubt that vaccines as a medical intervention have had a profound effect on controlling disease and improving the status of global health. In the two centuries since Edward Jenner's pioneering work on the smallpox vaccine, smallpox has successfully been eradicated as a result of improvements made to the vaccine over time and effective immunisation programmes. The polio vaccine has been another of the great success stories of modern medicine; the disease has effectively been eliminated in most parts of the world and the global elimination of poliomyelitis seems possible, with very few new cases in the early part of 2017 [2] . However, logistical, scientific and cultural challenges and high cost of the polio eradication endeavours may reduce enthusiasm for efforts to eradicate other infectious diseases with focus remaining on control. Nevertheless, the repertoire of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) is expanding and existing vaccines can be improved to enhance tolerability and increase the duration of protection.",

            "text": "Just twenty years ago, the UK national immunisation schedule was far more sparsely populated than it has become in the present day (see Table 1 ). In the early 1990s, the infant vaccination programme in the UK consisted of three doses of the diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis (DTwP), and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, and oral polio vaccine, with booster doses of DT and oral polio given later in childhood and again in adolescence, the live-attenuated measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In the space of the last two decades, the number of diseases against which children are immunised has greatly increased. The DTwP vaccine has been replaced by DTaP-IPV-Hib-HBV which contains acellular pertussis and inactivated polio virus vaccines, improving the programme's safety profile with the addition of hepatitis B vaccine included in the combination during 2017. An acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) can also be given to pregnant mothers and has been shown to protect neonates against pertussis. Effective polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines are now available for pneumococcus, Hib and capsular group A, C, W, and Y meningococcus. Rotavirus vaccine is now incorporated into the schedule and the HPV vaccine was introduced to protect girls against the major causes of cervical cancer. Vaccines against influenza, pneumococcus and shingles are now included in the programme to protect the elderly. The ongoing decline in infant mortality can be partly attributed to the control of infectious disease through public health measures including immunisation (see Fig. 1A ). The UK has benefited from a significant decline in the incidence of measles and rubella as a result of introduction of the MMR vaccine, estimated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) at 90% and 99%, respectively [3] . However, the burden of VPD and infant mortality remains substantial in low-and middle-income countries (see Fig. 1B ). Recent figures show that diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine coverage has reached 86% worldwide [4] , but it is estimated that, globally, as many as 19.4 million children do not have access to essential vaccines and up to 1.5 million more deaths could be avoided annually by improving vaccine coverage [1] . Access to vaccines is clearly the greatest problem to be overcome in reducing infant mortality worldwide. However, there are other social factors which contribute to underuse of vaccines even in countries with full immunisation programmes in place. Scientifically, most of the remaining challenges in the field of vaccinology can be attributed to gaps in knowledge of the immune responses required to induce protection against specific pathogens, overcome pathogenic variation and enhance sub-optimal immune responses in certain age groups. The main obstacles to progress in this field and reducing the global burden of infectious disease are the focus of this review.",

The problem of access to vaccines in such countries is not limited to new vaccines; there is demand for basic existing vaccines such as DTP-Hib-HBV, PCV, rotavirus and MMR, yet access remains insufficient [5] . Inaccessibility can be as a result of lack of proximity to health services; studies have highlighted lower rates of vaccine use and delay in vaccine uptake associated with rural communities in several programmes established to combat disease in Africa such as influenza in Kenya [6] and HPV in Nigeria [7] . Rural living has also been associated with lower rates of primary immunisation in more economically advantaged countries such as Ireland [8] . Even in urban environments engagement in immunisation programmes can be limited by factors such as poor living conditions and lack of education, particularly amongst migrant communities which suffer from economic disadvantages [9, 10] .",

            "text": "Despite widespread access to basic and novel vaccines, vaccine uptake is still sub-optimal in some high-income countries. The association between unvaccinated individuals and VPD epidemics has been highlighted by a retrospective study of recent measles and pertussis outbreaks in the US which found that a significant proportion of cases in each outbreak affected those who had not received the relevant vaccine [14] . There are concerns relating to the safety and necessity of vaccination among a small percentage of the population. While such hesitancy does not directly affect uptake, its influence on decision-making and contribution to social uncertainty must not be underestimated. In the current era, medical and scientific authorities are under increased public scrutiny while individual choice in matters of healthcare has become more popular. The factors contributing to this are many, but controversies have had a substantial impact on attitudes towards vaccination. One recent example is the now refuted MMR claims over a proposed link with autism which was set in motion by a paper published in a medical journal in the UK and, as a result of media influence and advocacy groups, diffused across the globe [15] . It took many years before public opinion reverted and MMR vaccine uptake was restored [16] , though many parents still cite fear of autism as a concern [15] . The best way to deal with these and other concerns that people may have is through education and public engagement but understanding the causes of hesitancy and specific interventions to address these concerns is crucial for effective management. The Vaccine Safety, Attitudes, Training and Communication Project is a European project which has shed light on many of the key issues surrounding parental attitudes to vaccination through national surveys [17] . Improving understanding and acceptance of immunisation is of great importance for future national and global health.",

In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has developed a methodology for assessing cost-effectiveness and uses a cost of \u00a320-\u00a330k for every quality-adjusted life year as an upper limit for a public health intervention to be cost-effective, though this is not the sole basis of acceptance or rejection [19] . Risk of decision error, relative contribution of various sources of uncertainty and possible actions to reduce uncertainty must also be taken into consideration in order to maximise certainty of the net health benefit of a vaccine [20] . The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, an independent expert advisory committee, uses this methodology in making recommendations for the inclusion of a new vaccine in the immunisation schedule. Implementation policies vary between countries but all require the availability of sufficient data relating to disease burden, vaccine efficacy and economic and financial cost. Due to the multi-disciplinary and region-specific nature of implementation research, introduction of novel vaccines and escalation of vaccine coverage involves extensive collaboration between local research networks, industry and national government. This poses a challenge for countries which lack this infrastructure or financial capacity for implementation and will require the continued support of WHO initiatives.",

            "text": "Genetic variability of pathogens represents one of the greatest challenges to the design of novel effective vaccines. RNA viruses typically exhibit great genetic diversity and rapid evolution, making them particularly difficult targets for vaccination. This variation is partly attributable to the inherent error-prone nature of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and its lack of proofreading activity. The rate of mutation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in vivo is astounding, estimated at 4.1 \u00b1 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 per base per cell and 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 per base per replication cycle, respectively [21, 22] . Bacterial pathogens also exhibit significant diversity in circulating strains within and between different populations. Capsular polysaccharides have been effectively targeted for pneumococcus and meningococcus, but protein antigens are less conserved between strains. For example, the immunogenic outer membrane protein, PorA, of Neisseria meningitidis exhibits phase variation through a combination of mutation, site-specific recombination and epigenetic control of promoter regions, allowing the bacterium to evade bactericidal antibodies directed against this antigen [23] . The protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum also exhibits antigenic diversity with polymorphisms in variable regions of its genome producing a range of antigen variants across endemic regions [24] . Even when relatively conserved structural proteins are targeted in vaccine formulations, universal vaccine efforts will require advanced knowledge of molecular epidemiology and genetic variability between populations. Understanding the structural biology of antigen components of vaccine formulations is an important consideration when targeting multiple strains of a pathogen and extending vaccine strain coverage.",

The strongest correlation between genotype and phenotype is seen in complete nonresponders to the hepatitis B vaccine whose HLA class II alleles are associated with antibody response to hepatitis B [26] . A more complete understanding of the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms identified in genome-wide studies through functional studies will be important in developing improved vaccines to overcome such variation within the population.

Its priorities include pathogens associated with recent outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Ebola and Zika virus, and several other emerging pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).

The virus causes respiratory tract infections (RTIs) which range from mild upper RTIs to severe lower RTIs, with up to half of children suffering from the latter developing recurrent wheezing or asthma [30] . After malaria, RSV is the leading cause of infectious death in infants worldwide and is responsible for approximately 6.7% of all deaths in this age group [31] .

Indeed, one candidate has been demonstrated safe and immunogenic in pregnant women and a Phase III clinical trial has been initiated to determine its efficacy [34] . Maternal immunisation has become an important approach to providing early protection in neonates and simultaneously offering a level of protection to pregnant women. During the natural course of a pregnancy, IgG antibodies are transferred from the mother to the developing foetus across the placental barrier via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) present on syncytiotrophoblast cells, conferring passive immunity [35] . For diseases such as pertussis which have peak incidence in the first months of life, maternal immunisation could provide protection for babies prior to receiving active routine immunisation in early infancy. Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (TDaP) vaccination in pregnant women has provided proof-of-principle that vaccination of pregnant women is safe for both mother and child and that antibodies can be protective in newborns [36] . Such a strategy would also be effective in the prevention of group B streptococcal infection (GBS), which is transferred from mother to child at birth and can cause pneumonia, bacteraemia and meningitis in 2-3% of colonised neonates [37] . A GBS candidate vaccine has also recently been shown to be safe and immunogenic in pregnant women [38] .

A comprehensive report published by the WHO in 2011 outlines in detail the global health burden caused by endemic HCAIs and makes a strong case for vaccine interventions [43] . Infections caused by Clostridium difficile, norovirus, and antibiotic-resistant Gram negative bacteria have become more frequent with the increasing use of antibiotics over the last few decades while Staphylococcus aureus remains the leading cause of HCAIs worldwide. The WHO recently published a list of a dozen families of bacteria which represent a serious threat to public health as a result of their acquisition of resistance genes [44] . Among these pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae were cited as being of highest priority. Research into developing vaccines against several of these bacteria is ongoing but is hindered by the lack of known correlates of protection and animal challenge models in which these can be demonstrated. The difficulties associated with targeting variable antigens also apply as many of these species exhibit substantial strain-to-strain variation. The threat of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains is one that could be best circumvented by immunoprophylaxis of major risk groups.",

These challenges arise largely because of the ability of these difficult pathogens to evade and manipulate the host immune response. In the case of HIV and HCV it is the considerable variability of protein sequence which develops during infection, which makes development of an inactivated vaccine based on a single sequence ineffective. Further understanding of the immune response to HIV may eventually provide the solution. One approach could be identification of broadly neutralising antibodies to prevent infection with the virus and cytotoxic T cell responses capable of eliminating infected CD4 + T cells. The induction of broadly-neutralising antibody responses to HIV epitopes has been exemplified in recent studies of HIV envelope trimers in primates [45] . Understanding the immunodominance of B cells to non-neutralising epitopes and the mechanisms by which germinal centre responses can be optimised will be important for improving methods of generating neutralising antibodies to novel immunogens.",

With regard to the former, efforts have been made to improve the existing Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine but have been hampered by lack of understanding for the variable efficacy of the vaccine against pulmonary TB [48] . TB vaccine development would benefit greatly from the identification of new correlates of protection and animal models which more accurately reflect the progression of human TB. Indeed, it remains unknown which responses are important in prevention of infection, while the responses used to contain natural infection, such as polyfunctional CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses, are better understood [49] . Transcriptomic analyses often accompany vaccine efficacy studies and are an important tool for the identification of early gene \"signatures\" which may predict immunogenicity. Extensive characterisation of the yellow fever vaccine, YF-17D, has provided proof-of-principle for the ability of such gene signatures to predict immune responses and protective immunity following immunisation [50, 51] . This transcriptomics/ systems biology approach will be a useful tool to delineate new correlates of protection and will aid vaccine candidate selection in the future.",

This is particularly important for dengue virus given that during a natural infection an infected individual generates long-lived, protective, neutralising antibodies against that serotype, but antibodies directed against other serotypes are cross-reactive and non-neutralising. This leads to an immunological phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement whereby dengue virus particles opsonised by these non-neutralising antibodies infect Fc receptor-expressing cells such as macrophages and monocytes [52] . The possibility of exacerbation of a secondary heterologous dengue virus infection requires a quadrivalent vaccine that produces consistent and long-lasting protection against all four serotypes to preclude this immunological enhancement.",

These changes are described as immunosenescence and represent an issue of growing global concern for the maintenance of a healthy aging population. The current thinking is that in advanced age, the differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells into lymphoid and myeloid precursors skews in the direction of the latter, leading to fewer lymphocytes in the circulation, the causes of which are reviewed elsewhere [54] .

While the trivalent influenza vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and herpes zoster vaccine are capable of mitigating their respective diseases to varying degrees, they do not induce a satisfactory immune response in the majority of the elderly population. Recent efforts to improve vaccine responses in the elderly have focused on increasing vaccine doses [56] , exploring the use of alternative adjuvants to stimulate the innate response and engineering viral vectors to engage T cell responses [57] . Some success has been achieved, for example, the zoster glycoprotein vaccine incorporating the AS01 B adjuvant system was recently shown to reduce the risk of herpes zoster infection in adults greater than 70 years of age in a Phase III clinical trial [58] . Greater understanding of the immunological factors that underlie the ageing adaptive response at the molecular and cellular level will be imperative to the development of restorative interventions that promote functional response to vaccination.",

The GAVI Alliance has done a great deal to bring vaccines to those most at risk, but middle-income countries do not meet the eligibility criteria for assistance.

The collaborative networks which have been established to deal with the threat of emerging infectious diseases provide testament to the effectiveness of partnerships between research institutes, industry and academia, allocating much needed resources to under-funded areas of research. Recent UK-based networks include those focused on maternal vaccines, vaccines for persistent intracellular infections, bacterial diseases and supporting the use of live infection challenge of volunteers to advance vaccinology [60] . The infrastructure put in place by these projects will create platforms for further research and development, ensuring that global health will continue to improve over future decades. ",
