The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia including 7 severely ill cases on 12 December 2019. The causative agent identified by the Chinese authorities was designated as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID\u201019]) by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 20 February 2020, there have been 74 675 confirmed cases in mainland of China, and more than 2000 people died. The virus have been spread widely to 26 countries, and the situations in Japan and South Korea are becoming serious as well, as of 22 February 2020, there have been already 756 infected cases in Japan (including the Diamond Princess cruise).",

Many mathematical researches focused on the modelling of the spread and development of the COVID\u201019. For instance, considering the epidemic's feature of spreading during the latent period, Cheng's group applied the time delay process to describe the typical feature and proposed a novel dynamical system to predict the outbreak and evolution of COVID\u201019. This model was called the Time Delay Dynamical\u2013Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (TDD\u2010NCP) model.1, 2 Based on this work, Chen et al also proposed a time delay dynamic system with an external source to describe the trend of local outbreak for COVID\u201019.3 Then, considering the fractional order derivatives, Chen et al proposed a novel time delay dynamic system with fractional order.4 In their system, the Riemann\u2010Liouville derivative was added that can describe the confirmed and cured people's growth process. Later, based on Chinese Centers for Disease Control's (CCDC's) statistical data, Shao et al proposed a series time delay dynamic system (called the Fudan\u2010CCDC model),5 and they estimated the reproductive number \nR0 of COVID\u201019 in their study6 based on Wallinga and Lipsitch frame work.8 The conclusion was, the \nR0 estimated is in \n[3.25,3.4] of COVID\u201019 that is bigger than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We refer our readers to some paralleled results.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 In 23 February, the Fudan\u2010CCDC model is specially used to warn that there could be a rapid outbreak in Japan if no effective quarantine measures are carried out immediately.7\n",

The following analysis related to the influence of such super spreaders will be our concentration.Stability problems with respect to the growth rate \nr: When we applied TDD\u2010NCP and Fudan\u2010CCDC models to the different regions in China and different countries, a very interesting observation is that, even if we take almost the same parameter \nr and although the kernels in these two models are different, we can have similar results. This leads to our further consideration on the stability of this parameter.The observability and controllability theory for two dynamical systems with respect to the isolated parameter \n\u2113: This parameter plays a significant role in our models. Estimating this parameter can help the government making the decision on whether the government should increase the quarantine strategy. It would be interesting to study the observability and controllability of two models with respect to \n\u2113. The optimal control problem will be very useful.What is the relation between our models and the classical Susceptible\u2010Exposed\u2010Infectious\u2010Recovered (SEIR) models?\n",
