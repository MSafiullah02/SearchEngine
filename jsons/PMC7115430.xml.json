The chemical structures of numerous xanthanolides are well documented, though much more is known of the biological data of the extracts than of their synthetic preparation. In general, the xanthanolides present a \u03b3-butirolactone fused to a seven-membered ring. Depending of this fusion, the xanthanolides can be divided into two structural types: the cis- (8-epi-xanthatin, xanthanolide numbering) and the trans-fused lactones (Fig. 1). Xanthatin (2) was first isolated from Xanthium pennsylvanicum by J. E. Little and co-workers [14] and its structure was established by Geissman et al. [4], [15]. The latter group suggested the possibility that xanthatin could be formed from xanthinin by dehydration during isolation, particularly during purification by column chromatography. The first total synthesis of a xanthanolide, specifically (\u2212)-dihydroxanthatin, was reported by Morken with sequential ruthenium-catalysed metathesis reactions [16]. Recently, Shishido and co-workers reported the enantiocontrolled total synthesis of (\u2212)-xanthatin from an optically pure bicyclic lactone [17].",

Therefore, Geissman and co-workers converted xanthinin to xanthatin by treatment with sodium acetate in ethanol [15]. In this work, to determine the principal constituents of infusions of X. spinosum, extraction was performed by boiling the dry extract in water for a short period of time, assisted by ultrasound. The crude residue represented 24% of the dry weight of fresh plants of X. spinosum used as the starting material. This simple process requiring little time (30 min), mild temperatures (<100 \u00b0C) and soft frequencies (ranging from 20 to 50 kHz) is very efficient. These conditions favour the conversion of xanthinin (1) to xanthatin (2), and this would explain the formation of xanthatin (2) and no detection of xanthinin (1) or its derivatives.",

            "text": "The formation of neovessels from the endothelium of pre-existing vessels is an essential part of embryonic development and, tissue repair and plays a critical role in the progression of several fatal diseases including cancer, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis [29]. The vasculature density is correlated with the malignancy and aggressiveness of tumor. Angiogenesis favours the growth of solid tumors as well as their invasion and metastasis [30], [31]. Clinical results for the first generation of anti-angiogenic drugs demonstrated no additional clinical benefit compared with the classic antitumor treatments. Consequently, more research will be needed to obtain more promising angiogenesis inhibitors. The rat aortic ring explants model in three-dimensional collagen gel matrixes and the HUVEC capillary tube formation assay on a Matrigel synthetic basement membrane matrix are commonly used in vitro angiogenesis systems. The anti-angiogenic response to xanthatin was evaluated in vitro in rat aorta ring explant cultures over 14- days in the presence of exogenous VEGF stimulation. Dose-related inhibitory effects on microvessel growth were observed from 0.03 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM (Fig. 4\n) and 0.3 nM to 3 \u03bcM xanthatin (Fig. 5\n).",

This anti-angiogenic response was comparable to the effect of paclitaxel (IC50 = 0.002 \u03bcM) which is considered to be one of the best anti-angiogenic drugs. Xanthatin and paclitaxel showed similar behaviour. Thus, the anti-angiogenic effects of xanthatin and paclitaxel prevailed at low doses, while at high doses both showed cytotoxic activity. Moreover, the inhibition of angiogenesis is not dose-dependent for either compound. The inhibition of angiogenesis has not previously been studied either for xanthatin or for xanthium extract, and these properties could be used in the treatment of solid tumor.",

Xanthatin shows cytotoxicity against L1210 and Hep-G2 cell lines. Excellent inhibition of angiogenesis was observed; comparable to that of paclitaxel.
