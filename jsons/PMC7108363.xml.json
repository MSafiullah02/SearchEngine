The advent of genomics tools provides us with an unprecedented view on the \u2018host-side\u2019 of this interaction. Together with advances in high-throughput technology, bioinformatics, and statistics this progress allows us to assess gene expression controlling the host response to viral infections in a genome wide fashion. With the latest generations of microarrays this can be achieved at the mRNA level with one single microarray. Microarray technology also extends to genotyping of the host (SNP analysis), and diagnostics by the identification of imprints in the host transcriptome characteristic for certain clinical conditions. In addition recent progress in the field of proteomics allows for the measurement of the expression levels of hundreds of proteins in a single biological sample, for example by mass spectrometry. Consequently, the \u2018genomics revolution\u2019 offers high-throughput tools to study the complex virus\u2013host interaction with changing expression levels of many genes and gene pathways as a direct function of viral and host genome properties. The challenge is to translate and digest this avalanche of information into palatable knowledge.",

            "text": "The principle of microarray assisted mRNA profiling has first been described in 1987 using a collection of cDNA fragments spotted on filter paper [1, 2]. Since then the technology has maturated considerably [3] and presently a range of high quality commercial microarray platforms is available either based on long DNA oligonucelotides (single probe per transcript) or short DNA oligonucleotides (multiple probes per transcript). Most of the available expression microarrays cover all genes or even all expressed exons of a certain organism [4]. In 1998, Zhu et al. first applied mRNA expression profiling to characterize the innate response to a viral infection (hCMV) in vitro [5]. Microarray technology has been more widely used in this field since 2001. Over the past years more than 200 papers reporting the results of mRNA expression studies of the host response to virus infection have been published, in which usually a restricted set of experimental design formats was applied. Here we review the recent developments in mRNA profiling of the innate antiviral response by highlighting in vitro studies that represent different experimental formats which allow optimal data analysis in \u2018virogenomics\u2019.",

Examples are the studies on influenza virus, HIV-1, HSV-1, and RSV [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In general these studies were limited in size and the results generally provided a global description of the (innate) antiviral response mainly expressed in terms of sets of either up-regulated or down-regulated genes that usually supported earlier observations. As it is difficult to interpret these results in isolation, Jenner and Young performed a meta-analysis on the data obtained from 32 studies that involved 77 different pathogen\u2013host interactions [12]. They were able to define a common host-transcriptional response in addition to a set of specific subresponses. Obviously the studies of this nature are \u2018conservative\u2019 in design and will at best identify shared (sub) responses that are strong enough to be detected against the intrinsically high level of noise because of the diversity in infection model systems and microarray platforms that were used in the original studies.",

As the host response to virus infection is dynamic a time course design is required when measuring the expression levels of many genes simultaneously without having pre-existing knowledge about the expression dynamics for most of the genes represented on the microarray. Piqueras et al. [13] elegantly demonstrated the power of the simple time course format. Using purified DCs from healthy donors it was shown that influenza virus triggers a \u2018coordinated chemokine production program\u2019 in three successive waves. This program allows for a coordinated mobilization of different immune effectors in response to viral infection: at different time points different sets of chemokine messengers are expressed that are associated with the attraction of neutrophils, CTLs, NK cells, memory T cells, and also na\u00efve T and B lymphocytes. The format nicely revealed a gene expression time pattern associated with the role of DCs in orchestrating a mounting immune response.",

The transcriptional response of DCs to different pathogens, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and influenza virus, was monitored. Both a shared core response and pathogen-specific programs for each of these pathogens were observed showing that DCs sense diverse pathogens and elicit tailored pathogen-specific immune responses. In a gene expression profiling study of a similar design we observed the induction of tightly regulated responses in lung epithelial cells to a set of respiratory viruses that segregated with the phylogenetic origins of the viruses involved (manuscript in preparation). Two other studies used a similar comparative approach but more closely related pathogens: human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) that is usually associated with common cold and the coronavirus that causes SARS (SARS-CoV). Tang et al. [14] compared the transcriptional response of these two viruses in a human epithelial cell line of liver origin (Huh7 cells) and Cheung et al. did the same with primary macrophages [15]. At two and four hours postinfection, much more perturbation of cellular gene transcription was observed after the infection of liver epithelial cells with SARS-CoV than with HCoV-229E. Predominantly genes associated with apoptosis, inflammation, stress response, and procoagulation were up-regulated. In contrast to HCoV-229E (and influenza A virus, that was also included in this study), SARS-CoV did induce chemokine messengers for, for example CXCL10 (IP10) and CCL2, but not for IFN-\u03b2 being a key component of innate immunity upon infection of macrophages [15]. This profile could explain certain key features of the pathogenesis of SARS.",

            "text": "In several mRNA expression profiling experiments the response induced by virus infection is compared to that induced by exposure to UV inactivated virus preparations, in order to identify replication-dependent and replication-independent changes in gene expression [11, 7, 16]. In general live virus infections induce more changes in gene expression. First of all this is because of the triggering of Toll-like receptors and similar pathogen-associated motif sensing receptor systems by, for example dsRNA molecules that are synthesized during viral replication. Exposure to nonreplicating antigen only induces relatively mild and short lasting responses. More and more mRNA expression profiling studies use molecularly cloned viruses in which genes are mutated, deleted, or inserted. With this approach the effect of well-defined modifications of the viral genome is evaluated in its natural context. Using this approach Geiss et al. [17] examined the \u2018downstream\u2019 effects of NS1 protein expression during infection with either wt influenza A virus or del NS1 mutant influenza viruses in a human lung epithelial cell line (A549). Deletion of the NS1 gene increased the number and magnitude of expression of cellular genes involved in the IFN, NF-\u03baB, and other antiviral pathways. Interestingly, a recombinant influenza virus carrying the 1918 pandemic NS1 gene was more efficient at blocking the expression of IFN-regulated genes than a closely related (wt) influenza virus (A/WSN/33). This demonstrated the contribution of the NS1 gene to viral pathogenesis by enabling the virus to disarm antiviral defense systems.",

[21] performed mRNA profiling on rubella virus infected primary human fetal fibroblasts and human adult lung fibroblasts. Although the gene expression levels of many functional gene categories were similarly perturbated, a marked difference between the two cell types was observed in genes associated with apoptosis (both for proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes). Because fetal fibroblasts did not undergo apoptosis when infected with rubella virus it was postulated that this could promote fetal virus persistence. Another study by Sato et al., monitored the transcriptional response of two cell lines to wild-type measles virus (MV) infection and to the infection of molecular cloned MV from which the V gene was deleted [22\u2022\u2022]. Upon wt MV infection, most genes were differentially regulated in epithelial cells and IFN signaling was for instance not induced in the lymphoid cells. Surprisingly the same cell-type-specific response was observed upon infection with MV delta V. Because it was previously reported that the V protein of MV inhibited the IFN-signaling pathway, the results indicate that during MV infection, other viral factors may also act as IFN-antagonists. Furthermore this study demonstrated that during MV infection, host factors might counteract and/or overcome the inhibitory effect of IFN-antagonists like the V protein, depending on the specific cell type. These studies elegantly demonstrate the level of complexity and multidimensionality of virus\u2013host interactions and what kind of specific experimental design and format may be required to address such complex interactions. In this case a combination of platforms has been fully exploited.",

For example, to identify the spectrum of host genes induced by the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, Hela cells engineered to express a degradation-resistant mutant of I\u03baBa under the control of an inducible promoter were used in two expression-profiling studies. This system allowed for a tight regulation of NF-\u03baB-dependent gene expression. Tian et al. and O\u2019Donnell et al. used this system to identify the NF-\u03baB-dependent gene network in cells infected with RSV and a mammalian reovirus respectively [23\u2022, 24] and demonstrated that NF-\u03baB mediated the induction of innate responses induced by these infections. Elco et al. performed mRNA profiling on a set of gene deletion cell lines infected with Sendai virus and demonstrated that TLR3 was dispensable for gene induction by this virus. By contrast, Jak1, NF-\u03baB, and IRF-3 were essential for the induction of specific subsets of genes and IRF-3 could even suppress the expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent genes in Sendai virus infected cells [25]. Fredericksen et al. showed in experiments with a similar design, that RIG-I and MDA5 are responsible for triggering downstream gene expression in response to West Nile virus infection by signaling through IPS-1 [26\u2022]. Taken together, such experiments dissect and define the roles of individual genes and the interconnected networks in which they interact with at multiple levels. Although less specific, the studies in which host cells are preconditioned or treated with cytokines and/or other (immune) modulators may also help in dissecting interacting gene networks responding to virus infections [27, 28].",

From these overall gene expression patterns, detailed pathogenic pathways were however difficult to elucidate. Similarly, the analysis of host responses to SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of adolescent cynomolgus macaques revealed the induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including a wide range of type I interferons, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10 (Figure 1A [32\u2022\u2022]). Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral-signaling pathways, including the type 1 IFN-induced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, were differentially regulated in infected and noninfected cells (Figure 1B). This suggests that, although SARS-CoV blocks IFN signaling in infected cells, locally produced IFNs are capable of activating noninfected cells and possibly can prevent the infection of these cells. It may be expected that in vivo virogenomics studies using series of genetically modified viruses in genetically modified host animals will ultimately be the best format to study virus\u2013host interactions at the molecular level.",
