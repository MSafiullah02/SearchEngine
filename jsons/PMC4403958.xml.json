Clinical and atopic status were defined by questionnaire, skin prick testing, serum IgE, and lung function testing including PEF, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and histamine challenge performed according to guidelines 16. The asthmatic group had a concentration of histamine causing a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PC20) < 8 mg/mL, the normal group > 8 mg/mL. Normal subjects were taking no medication; asthmatics inhaled short\u2010acting \u03b22\u2010agonists only. None of the asthmatic patients were given any inhaled or oral/systemic steroid at any time point in the study. Subjects were free of common cold symptoms for 6 weeks before commencing the study.

It has been shown that during naturally occurring virus\u2010induced asthma exacerbations, neutrophils are recruited into the airways as part of the immune defence 8. The influx of neutrophils correlates with symptoms and parameters of airways obstruction such as FEV1\n19. Accordingly, we observed in our experimental model higher values of BAL neutrophils at day 4 after intranasal experimental infection. However, these changes were moderate, probably due to the small number of patients and the rather mild severity of the induced asthma exacerbations. Recruitment into this intensive and burdensome study was difficult resulting in small numbers of patients. Moreover, also due to ethical constraints, experimental exacerbations had to be mild in character. The results presented are thus also consequences of these requirements. Symptoms and reductions in FEV1 were significantly greater in asthmatics compared with controls as previously reported 5. It has been shown before that 4 days after experimental RV infection, the inflammatory response of the upper airways is increased which is associated with increased symptoms and airways obstruction in asthmatics 20.",

To our knowledge, the only other cell type for which HNP 1\u20133 expression has been shown is \u03b3\u03b4\u2010CD 8 cells in blood 21. Hence, we do not expect that there are any other relevant cellular sources of HNP 1\u20133 than neutrophils in BAL. In favour of this is also the fact that CXCL8/IL\u20108 was the only chemokine significantly increased at day 4 in asthmatics. It has been shown that HNP 1\u20133 can induce CXCL8/IL\u20108 22, which may explain to a certain degree the significantly higher levels observed at day 4 5. Significantly higher levels of CXCL8/IL\u20108 and a trend for higher CXCL1/GRO\u2010\u03b1 in BAL at day 4 were related to high virus load measured in nasal lavage. This may be a result of increased induction of CXCL8/IL\u20108 and CXCL1/GRO\u2010\u03b1 in asthmatics by RVs. It has been shown in vitro that RV infection of human respiratory epithelial cell line significantly increases CXCL8/IL\u20108 23. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the intramuscular injection of synthetic HNP1 induces the transcript expression of genes encoding both pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (IL\u20101beta and TNF\u2010alpha) and the chemokine CXCL8/IL\u20108. Furthermore, HNP1 showed chemotactic capacity towards leucocytes 24. These findings suggest that RV infection induces CXCL8/IL\u20108, which has chemotactic activity towards neutrophils, thereby increasing neutrophil numbers in the airway which release HNP 1\u20133 which has properties that will further enhance neutrophilia.",

It was suggested that \u03b1\u2010defensins (HNP 1\u20133) cannot directly inactivate non\u2010enveloped viruses such as RVs 10. However, recent research showed that this is not completely true. It was shown that human \u03b1\u2010defensins (HD\u20105) can block adenovirus uncoating 29. Moreover, it is known that HNP 1\u20133 are potent antagonists of infection by both cutaneous and mucosal papillomavirus types by blocking virion escape from endocytic vesicles 30. Thus, HNP 1\u20133 do have direct antiviral properties against non\u2010enveloped viruses and might also have direct antiviral properties against RV infection. In addition, HNP 1\u20133 might have indirect antiviral effects. They have recently been shown to inhibit HIV\u20101 replication even when added 12 h post\u2010infection 31. Moreover, it was demonstrated that HNP1 can affect the ability of adenoviruses to infect epithelial cells 32. \u03b1\u2010defensins have chemoattractant properties towards both CD8+ and CD4+/CD45RA+ T cells 33. Increased levels of \u03b1\u2010defensins during viral infection could therefore recruit both CD4+ and CD8+ cells to the airways. This may enhance antiviral immunity as it has been shown in a variety of murine models that HNPs enhance antigen\u2010specific humoral and cellular immunity 34, 35, 36. However, one has to bear in mind as laid out above that increased defensin expression could also be an epiphenomenon of airways neutrophila which is considered to contribute to asthma exacerbations.",

This correlation in the absence of a significant increase in response to RV infection (probably due to low subject numbers) must be interpreted with caution.

Experimental RV infection in humans provides an excellent model of virus\u2010induced asthma under controlled conditions including application of a standard dose of a single virus serotype and standardized clinical data collection. Invasive sampling can be carried out under controlled conditions repeatedly and at accurately defined time points. However, this elaborate study design is extremely labour\u2010intensive which accounts for limitation of number of subjects that can be included in such a study. Thus, subject numbers have to be small. For safety reasons, only mild asthmatics could be included into the study. This limits the ability to study more severe forms of asthma. Another important aspect is that BAL sampling time points had to be limited to 3 due to the invasive character of this investigation, and it seems possible that the time points chosen (baseline, 4 days and 6 weeks after experimental infection) do not correspond to the peak changes in CXC chemokine and/or AMP expression. Moreover, the analysis of soluble markers in respiratory secretions is complex because of dilution, modification, and degradation. Nevertheless, we found significant differences between asthmatics and normal controls which results from meticulous patient characterization before inclusion. Regarding in vitro findings and preliminary in vivo data, our results deliver direct evidence that RV infections increase levels of \u03b1\u2010defensins in the airways. This has been assumed as RV infections lead to marked neutrophil infiltration and degranulation in the airways 11, 39. This finding is of possible importance as neutrophil degranulation is associated with clinical severity of virus\u2010induced asthma 12.",
