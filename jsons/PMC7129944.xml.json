            "text": "Antibodies (Abs) play a crucial role in the immune system, especially in the defenses against extracellular pathogens (such as the encapsulated bacteria) and pathogens in extracellular phases of their life cycle (such as viral particles), and as such are a major immune component elicited by all vaccines currently in use for humans. Abs also have a variety of uses as biochemical and cellular markers, affinity reagents, diagnostics and therapeutics. Thus, our understanding of the principles governing the interactions of Abs with antigens (Agns) is of great significance to a wide spectrum of research and applications. Phage-display technology has been used to study Ab\u2013Agn interactions with libraries of two types. Random peptide libraries (RPLs) have been used as a source from which peptide ligands can be identified for an Ab, without knowledge of the site on the Agn that the Ab recognizes (the epitope). Agn-fragment libraries (AFLs; also known as gene-fragment libraries) have served as a means of localizing epitopes to specific areas of protein Agns. In this review, we discuss recent progress with RPLs and AFLs in producing Ab-specific markers and epitope mimics, and as tools for mapping protein epitopes. Major focus is also given to the uses and limitations of these technologies in the development of vaccines and diagnostic tools. For brevity's sake, this review does not cover the significant body of work on peptide mimics of carbohydrate, and other non-protein Agns, nor on their development as vaccine and diagnostic leads. We briefly review Ab\u2013protein-Agn interactions, phage-displayed RPLs and AFLs, and phage as immunogens. This is followed by a discussion of recent advances in the use of these libraries in epitope mapping, improvement of affinity, vaccine design, and in the search for pathogens involved in idiopathic disease.",

Agn\u2013Ab interactions have thus provided an excellent model for elucidating the principles of macromolecular recognition, and especially protein\u2013protein recognition. The molecular surfaces mediating contact between an Ab and an Agn are called the paratope and epitope, respectively. The Ab repertoire has evolved to recognize a vast number of epitopes comprising proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and even small chemical compounds (haptens), including man-made ones. As this review focuses primarily on protein Agns, it is important to distinguish between the general types of protein epitopes and the mechanisms by which Abs bind them. Protein epitopes usually bind Ab in three ways.1.Complementary fit between epitope and paratope.2.A larger number of lower-energy contacts (such as van der Waals interactions and H bonds) that define the surface of the epitope.3.A few (one to five) high-energy contacts (such as salt bridges) that confer a large component to the energy of binding.\n",

The location of CBRs with respect to each other on the polypeptide chain of the antigen determines whether an epitope is linear or discontinuous. CBRs located within a short stretch of contiguous polypeptide sequence form linear epitopes, whereas discontinuous epitopes comprise CBRs located at distant sites on the polypeptide sequence that are brought together on the Agn surface by protein folding [3]. Epitopes whose affinity is affected by unfolding of the protein are said to be constrained; almost all discontinuous and many linear epitopes are constrained. Moreover, most protein epitopes occur at relatively protuberant and flexible sites on the protein surface [4].",

These principles are important in understanding the molecular basis by which peptides functionally mimic protein and non-protein epitopes (by binding the same paratope as the \u2018native\u2019 epitope) and structurally mimic them (by making identical contacts with the paratope to those made by the \u2018native\u2019 epitope). The concept of mimicry takes on added complexity in considering how peptide mimics may function as immunogenic mimics that elicit the same Ab as the corresponding epitope on the \u2018native\u2019 immunogen. Considering the simplest case of a peptide that is a structural mimic of much or all of a linear epitope that elicited a given Ab, such a peptide is expected to function as an immunogenic mimic in eliciting that same Ab, given the proper immunization conditions (e.g. structural format of the peptide, carrier protein [including helper-T cell epitopes], adjuvant, genetic background of the animal). However, one can also imagine the situation in which a peptide binds tightly and very specifically to a targeted Ab, producing, say, the same affinity as the native epitope, but via a different network of contacts with the Ab paratope. Would this peptide make a useful immunogenic mimic? The significance of peptides as structural mimics of an epitope versus purely functional mimics (that contact Ab through different interactions from the \u2018native\u2019 epitope) has yet to be clearly defined as it pertains to immunogenic mimicry.",

The pIII-display vectors can produce fusions with all four to five copies of pIII, or \u2018hybrid phage\u2019 that display less than one copy of the fusion per phage; the latter vectors use two copies of gene 3 (one wild-type gene, and one recombinant copy that encodes the fusion; Fig. 1\nb). Only short peptides of six to eight amino acids can be displayed on all copies of pVIII without disruption of phage assembly 10., 11., 12.. Larger peptides can be displayed by hybrid phage via two copies of gene 8, with one copy encoding the wild-type protein, and the other the pVIII fusion protein. The copy number of fusion proteins to wild-type pVIII will vary depending on the vector and the sequence and length of the peptides or proteins displayed; however, for most pVIII-displayed, short peptides (of <25residues), the fusion copy number ranges from 5\u201315% of the total pVIII. The pIII- and pVIII-displayed peptides can be of varying lengths (typically pIII accommodates larger-sized fusions than pVIII), and conformational constraints can be imposed by the presence of one or more cysteine residues. Interestingly, pVIII-displayed peptide fusions containing two cysteine residues almost always form a constrained loop, whereas those containing one cysteine form homodimers [13\u2022].",

Although they were able to generate a strong anti-phage Ab response, only marginal titers of Ab were elicited against the peptide, probably because of the low copy number of the peptide per phage. Indeed, Perham's group [10] showed that pVIII-display induces stronger anti-peptide responses upon immunization, even in the absence of an adjuvant. Meola et al. [19] showed that phage displaying a given peptide via fusion to pVIII produced better anti-peptide Ab responses than phage-borne fusion to pIII, recombinant fusion to human H ferritin or the hepatitis B core peptide, or synthetic peptide in the context of a multiple-antigenic peptide. More recently, our work has shown that the use of synthetic peptide conjugated to phage induces even stronger anti-peptide responses than pVIII-displayed recombinant phage, most probably as a result of an even higher copy number of peptide (NE van Houten, MB Zwick, PWHI Parren, DR Burton, JK Scott, unpublished data). However, the phage carrier did not produce as strong an Ab response as the peptide coupled to the classical carrier protein, ovalbumin.",

On direct titration, the b12 Fab bound more tightly to recombinant phage bearing the peptide (100\u2013200 copies per virion) than to phage to which synthetic peptide had been conjugated at a much higher copy number (see \u2018RPLs and AFLs as a source of ligands for anti-protein Abs.\u2019, below). Thus, perhaps a peptide tethered to a flexible linker is less constrained than the same peptide in recombinant form, linked to the phage coat through a less-flexible peptide bond. In support of this observation, Felici et al.\n[21] found that a MAb, specific for a discontinuous epitope on Bordetella pertusis toxin, would not bind to an RPL-derived synthetic peptide even though it bound tightly to the phage-displayed version of it. Further, a collaboration between Perham's and Opella's groups has revealed, for two different antigenic peptides, that the structure of the peptide fused to pVIII is stable enough to detect by NMR, whereas the synthetic analog of either peptide in solution gives no resolvable structure 22., 23.. Interestingly, the structural stabilization of both peptides appears to derive from only their \u2018tethered\u2019 state (i.e. their peptidyl linkage to the amino terminus of pVIII), and not from other interactions (such as hydrogen bonding) with the phage coat.",

Phage bearing increased numbers of pVIII fusions to both growth-hormone and streptavidin (residues 16\u2013133) were selected on immobilized human growth hormone receptor (the extracellular domain) and anti-streptavidin PCAbs (polyclonal Abs), respectively.

Initial work in Perham's laboratory [25] showed that phage induce Ab responses that are helper T cell-dependent. Our work using fairly small (10 \u03bcg) doses has shown that anti-peptide Ab production against a peptide conjugated at high copy number to phage levels off after four to five immunizations, as compared with the same peptide conjugated to ovalbumin (even after the eighth and final immunization, the anti-peptide Ab response had not reached a plateau), though the ratio of Abs against peptide to those against carrier is higher for phage. This result suggests that the T cell responses produced by phage are not as strong as against other, more typical carrier proteins. Phage are mainly composed of the major coat protein pVIII (\u223c2700 copies per phage), which is only 50 residues long, and each of the remaining (minor) coat proteins, pIII, pVI, pVII and pIX, which occur in low copy number (3\u20135 per phage; Fig. 1a). Only pIII is significantly large (\u223c400 residues) and thus may present a variety of T cell and B cell epitopes. Moreover, filamentous phage, being a parasite of E. coli, a commensal bacterium living in the gut of many vertebrates, including humans, may have evolved its proteins to induce a low-level response, so as to evade mucosally generated Ab responses.",

Thus, the filamentous phage have the potential to serve as a carrier for responses against both foreign T cell and B cell epitopes. To optimize the phage carrier, immunogenic peptides that are endogenous to phage should be minimized or removed altogether (so called \u2018de-immunization\u2019), so that the target epitopes, introduced by recombinant means, would be fully immunodominant. Exciting work by Le Doussal et al. [27\u2022\u2022] suggests that it is possible for phage to display peptide\u2013MHC complexes, and thus to be used directly in T cell selections. Libraries of peptides fused to MHC molecules should be useful for determining the spectrum of peptides that is recognized by a particular T cell receptor, and may complement the tetrameric MHC\u2013peptide system for identifying specific T cell receptors [28].

The strength of the Ab response against phage may be, in part, due to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the particulate nature of the filamentous virion. Significant amounts of E. coli LPS are associated with phage; it probably adheres to the phage coat during phage assembly and/or phage extrusion through the pIV-based outer-membrane pore, a gated ion channel [30]. LPS can be removed by subjecting the phage to detergent before precipitation with polyethylene glycol and sodium chloride. Depending on the size of the single-stranded genome it encapsulates, a phage particle can be \u22652 \u03bcm long (wild-type phage are \u223c1 \u03bcm long). We have found that the Ribi Adjuvant System (Sigma#M6536) enhances the Ab response to fairly low doses of phage (e.g. 10\u201325 \u03bcg per subcutaneous injection). Small doses of phage may serve to induce higher-affinity Ab responses, because of more efficient competition for antigen in germinal centers.",

Recently, Matthews et al. (LJ Matthews, R Davis, GP Smith, personal communication) found that low copy number, especially of long peptides, made it difficult to assess the immunogenicity of phage-displayed peptides; thus, they transferred the peptides from the amino terminus of pVIII to the amino terminus of IPIII, an internal protein of T4 bacteriophage. Immunization with fusions to IPIII elicited, on average, 10-fold higher Ab titers than the phage-borne peptides. Moreover, their transfer of the peptides to the maltose-binding protein of E. coli, following Zwick et al.

Moreover, phage obtained from different libraries by the same MAb sometimes showed very different consensus sequences. They found that most of the MAbs against discontinuous epitopes isolated either weakly binding peptides or did not isolate binding peptides at all. One of the Abs used for screening was b12 [33], a human MAb that recognizes the CD4-binding site of the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120, neutralizes a broad spectrum of HIV-1 primary isolates in vitro, and protects macaques against mucosal challenge with a pathogenic SHIV strain (PWHI Parren, P Marx, AJ Hessell, A Luckay, J Harouse et al., personal communication). Only two weakly binding peptides were isolated by MAb b12; however, they shared a five-residue consensus sequence. Subsequently, Zwick et al.

The tightest-binding peptide identified in the sublibrary screening was shown to be a homodimer that is bridged by the single cysteine residues on two identical peptides.

Successful immunogenic mimicry of peptides from AFLs implies that the native epitope has been closely mimicked by the selected Agn fragment, but not so for peptide ligands isolated from RPLs; these may bind regions in the Ab-combining site that do not contact the native epitope, as well as regions in the Ab-combining site that directly contact the native epitope. Thus, the mechanism of cross-reactivity of peptides isolated from RPLs may not fully reflect the structure of the Ab-native epitope interaction. Nevertheless, MAbs and PCAbs have been used to identify immunogenic-mimic peptides from both RPLs and AFLs.",

[36] showed that a peptide, identified from screening an RPL with a MAb specific for glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, could be used to confer protective immunity to HSV-1 infection. Moreover, the affinity of the MAb for both the RPL-derived peptide and the 10-residue native linear epitope (mapped with the peptide) were approximately equal, suggesting that the CBRs had been identified. Bastien et al. [37] conferred immunity to respiratory syncytial virus by immunizing mice with phage displaying (via pIII) a previously identified, protective epitope (173\u2013187) of its glycoprotein G. These experiments laid the foundation for the concept that linear epitopes, both from RPLs and AFLs, could induce neutralizing Ab production. Further evidence supporting this has been obtained by Grabowska et al. [38], who originally mapped a linear epitope on HSV-2 using an RPL and pepscanning. More recently, they showed that immunization of mice with the phage-displayed peptides conferred protective immunity against challenge with a lethal dose of HSV-2, and that survival was dependent on the amount of phage used for immunization [39\u2022]. In similar work, Yu et al. [40\u2022] used protective MAbs that recognize discontinuous (one MAb) and linear (two MAbs) epitopes on the surface-glycoprotein (surface glycoprotein) of murine coronavirus to screen a panel of RPLs. Although all three MAbs isolated binding phage, only one of the selected clones (which mimicked a continuous epitope on the surface-glycoprotein) induced a statistically-significant protective immune response. Interestingly, phage bearing the same consensus sequence as the protective clone, but different flanking sequences, did not induce protective immunity, indicating an important role for the regions flanking the consensus sequence in inducing cross-reactive Abs. Thus, protective Ab responses have been induced by phage-displayed peptides; however, in all the cases mentioned, the immunogenic-mimic peptides corresponded to linear protein epitopes on the cognate pathogens.",

Following this approach, Scala et al. [42\u2022] screened two RPLs with serum Abs from HIV-1-infected people and identified phage that reacted with multiple sera. These phage were then used to immunize mice, and the sera from several mice was shown to stain immunoblots of the HIV-1 envelope proteins.

In many cases, there are multiple sites of neutralization that are immunodominant on the Agn or organism, making neutralizing Abs relatively straightforward to elicit. However, if the protein or the organism is difficult to produce, or if neutralization sites are not immunodominant, then the approach of identifying epitope-mimic peptides to serve as immunogenic mimics may be useful. In these cases, it would be helpful to use neutralizing MAbs for the search (rather than PCAbs), so as to limit the epitope-mimics obtained to those involved in neutralization. HIV-1 infection is such a case; although a strong Ab response is elicited against the viral envelope proteins, rarely are broadly neutralizing specificities produced in significant amounts. Moreover, many of the anti-envelope-protein Abs produced bind the envelope proteins in free form, but will not bind them in the context of the viral envelope [33].",

They screened an RPL with the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, which often contains high concentrations of oligoclonal Abs, whose specificity and role in MS is unknown. Phage displaying the selected peptides were shown to react with both the serum and the CSF of the same patient, as well as with the serum of other MS patients and normal patients, but only sometimes showed cross-reactivity with the CSF of other MS patients. Such reactivity indicates that the CSF Abs from different MS patients did not have the same specificity (the Abs probably resulted from nonspecific immunodysregulation), and that the peptides may be mimicking ubiquitous Agns, not essential to the disease state at the time of the analysis. In further work, Cortese et al\n[44\u2022\u2022] studied a phage-displayed peptide, representative of a family of peptides selected with the common motif Lys\u2013Pro\u2013Pro\u2013Asn\u2013Pro. As this was the dominant motif identified, the sera were further tested for their ability to bind a panel of neurotropic viruses. Interestingly, a phage clone, selected for its good reactivity to CSF Abs and sera of MS patients, was shown to cross-react with an epitope present in the envelope glycoprotein B of HSV-1. Moreover, Abs generated against this clone identified a brain-specific protein by Western blot. This brain protein, thus, may be a putative target for HSV-1-induced autoimmune Ab responses. Importantly, this approach may reveal evidence supporting the long-held hypothesis that common viral infections trigger the production of self-reactive CSF Abs in MS.",

Thus, Abs elicited against a phage-displayed, epitope-mimic peptide cross-react with the native epitope in the context of the whole Agn or pathogen. The basis of such cross-reactivity is unclear. It is apparent, however, that the structure of recombinant peptide is influenced by fusion to the phage coat, and as such, synthetic peptides conjugated to carrier may not be as effective as recombinant phage in inducing cross-reacting Abs [20]. More stringent assays of cross-reactivity are required in assessing the success of an epitope-mimic peptide, whether it be from a RPL or an AFL. Studies should be undertaken to analyze the V genes and structure of the Abs that have been induced by immunization with an epitope-mimic peptide, to allow its comparison with the MAb used to select it. Also needed are structures of the screening MAb, both free and bound to native Agn and to peptide mimic, as well as the corresponding structures of the bound and free MAbs elicited by the immunogenic-mimic peptides. Such work should establish whether peptides can indeed be used to elicit the same or similar Abs as those used in the initial peptide selection. This type of analysis has most closely been achieved by Demangel et al.\n[29] and Goldbaum et al.\n[48].",

            "text": "Demangel et al. [29] compared MAb D14-3 (raised against a carboxy-terminal fragment of the major merozoite surface protein 1 of Plasmodium vivax), used in their library screening, with MAbs elicited by selected peptide, and from this showed some similarities in V gene usage and the hypervariable-loop canonical structures [49] of the two types of MAb. Lower sequence homology, however, was found in the hypervariable regions (especially in CDR-H3), and preliminary structural models suggested significant differences in the Ab combining sites. The best example of immunogenic mimicry of a discontinuous protein epitope comes from Goldbaum et al. [48]. Their work, however, involved not peptides, but anti-idiotypic Abs raised against a MAb. Following the network theory of Jerne and others [50], they used the well-characterized murine MAb D1.3, which binds a discontinuous epitope on hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL), to immunize mice. An anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) MAb was shown by crystallographic study to behave similar to HEL, in binding the D1.3 paratope via many of the same contacts as HEL. Further, anti-anti-Id Abs raised in mice using rabbit PCAbs against D.13 were also shown to behave as D1.3, in binding HEL, and the anti-Id MAb, via many of the same contacts as D1.3. The K\nd of the D1.3-HEL interaction was 1\u00d710\u22128M, whereas those of HEL with the two anti-anti-Id MAbs were 1.8\u00d710\u22126M and 3.8\u00d710\u22126M; moreover, the V gene usage, including the HCDR-3 region, of the anti-anti-Id MAbs were very similar to those of D.13. Thus, even though there was significant affinity of the anti-anti-Id MAbs for HEL, it was still lower than that of D1.3 for HEL, and the affinity of the anti-anti-Id MAbs for the epitope-mimic (anti-Id) MAb was greater than the cross-reactivity with HEL. This study constitutes an elegant and significant contribution to the development and analysis of immunogenic-mimics.",
