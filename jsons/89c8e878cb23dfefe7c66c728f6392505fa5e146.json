Eight observers (2 thoracic and 2 general senior radiologists, 2 junior radiologists and 2 emergency physicians) retrospectively categorized each CT into one out of 3 categories (evocative, compatible for COVID-19 pneumonia, and not evocative or normal). Observer agreement for categorization between all readers and pairs of readers with similar experience was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient.

            "text": "Since December 2019, a new respiratory disease related to a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, developed in China and rapidly spread to other countries, reaching a pandemic stage in March 2020 [1, 2] . Even if the disease follows a benign course in many cases, some patients develop respiratory difficulties requiring hospitalization, leading to a large amount of patients with clinical suspicion of coronavirus disease 2019 presenting to the emergency departments [3] . Accurate identification of COVID-19 patients is crucial to isolate them from not infected patients and to limit the diffusion of the outbreak. The reference standard is the positivity of the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); nevertheless, the sensitivity of this test remains unclear, having been reported between 42 and 71 % in some early series [4] [5] [6] , because of suboptimal sampling technique, limitations in performance assay or low viral load in the nasopharyngeal area. Chest CT shows abnormalities in a large majority of cases, with some signs described as typical or very evocative of the disease in the current outbreak context [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Sensitivity of chest CT has been reported as high as 97% as compared to RT-PCR [4] and CT abnormalities could precede RT-PCR positivity [12] . Because of its readily availability, chest CT may assist firstline triage of patients presenting to hospital [3] . Several Radiology Societies [6, [13] [14] [15] have proposed structured reporting of CT into categories, defined according to the typical or less typical appearance of lung involvement, to facilitate communication with physicians. In routine practice, categorization is based on each reader individual impression supported by numerous papers having described imaging signs of COVID-19 pneumonia [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Such categorization may directly impact the clinical decision-making. However, the reproducibility of the categorization is unknown and the clinical significance of the different categories is unclear. Thus, the objectives of our study were to assess inter-observer agreement to categorize CT findings as well as performances of chest CT across the different categories in patients suspected of COVID-19 presenting to hospital.",

The role of chest CT for patients suspected of COVID-19 is not completely established. Despite limitations in sensitivity and result delays, the RT-PCR remains the diagnostic reference and chest CT is not recommended for screening by most Radiology Societies [6, 15, 19, 20] . According to a recent consensus statement from the Fleischner Society [20] , imaging may be indicated for diagnosis when RT-PCR is negative or unavailable in patients having risk factors for worsening or moderate-to-severe respiratory signs. In our study, most patients who had chest CT at the emergency room had indeed either moderate or severe clinical features or comorbidities. Chest CT helped addressing or transferring patients into the proper, COVID-19 or not COVID-19, hospitalization area, especially those needing urgent decision, before the RT-PCR result was provided. Chest CT could favor re-testing in cases with negative RT-PCR [12] . Patients with a first negative RT-PCR and a chest CT considered \u00abcompatible\u00bb have been more frequently re-tested and had a subsequent PCR more frequently positive, as compared to patients with a first negative RT-PCR and a chest CT considered \u00abnot evocative\u00bb. Of note, two patients had a final COVID-19 retained diagnosis based on typical clinical and CT presentation and evolution, despite two negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests. All rights reserved.

Whether positive CTs in these studies showed typical imaging features is unclear. Our results differ, chest CT classified evocative having 75% sensitivity and 95% specificity and chest CT classified evocative or compatible having 85% sensitivity and 77% specificity. These differences may be attributable to differences in CT features between an \u00abevocative\u00bb CT and a \u00abpositive\u00bb CT as well as differences in characteristics of the population having chest CT. The prevalence of the disease in the population, severity and type of clinical presentation, time from symptom to CT, age of patients and any underlying pulmonary pathology may modify the performances of chest CT for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia [20, 23] .

Chest CT can participate in estimating the likelihood of COVID-19 in patients presenting to hospital during the outbreak.

All readers classified each examination into one out of 4 categories, as follows: evocative, compatible, not evocative of COVID-19 and normal following the recommendations of the French Society of Radiology [14]. The global impression of each reader was supported by previous typical and less typical reported signs in the literature. A guide was provided, recalling these signs. The \"evocative\" category included multifocal ground-glass opacities (GGO), being nodular or not, or crazy-paving with or without consolidations, with a bilateral, peripheral or mixed distribution and involvement of the posterior zones. The intermediate category \"compatible\" corresponded to cases showing abnormalities already reported in COVID-19 but that may be encountered in other diseases or very limited in extent. It included GGO and/or consolidations with very few lesions and unilateral distribution, exclusive central distribution or absence of posterior lung areas involvement, halo sign as main abnormality, and association of typical opacities, with atypical signs or other lesions. The category \"not evocative\" corresponded to cases showing abnormalities very rarely reported in COVID-19 or typical of another diagnosis as isolated systematized consolidation, discrete centrilobular nodules with tree-in-bud appearance or lung cavitation in favor of other lung infection, centrally distributed GGO with septal lines and pleural effusion in favor of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, peripheral reticulations with or without honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis and GGO in favor of interstitial lung disease.",
