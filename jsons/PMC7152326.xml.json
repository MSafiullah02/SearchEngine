Rabbits require regular ingestion of high-fiber diets consisting of grass and grass hays.

The concurrent presence of hard fecal pellets and perineal fecal soiling indicates soft, poorly formed, or noningested cecotrophs rather than diarrhea. Cecotrophal soiling of the perineum is often mistaken for diarrhea.\u2022True diarrhea is more common in young rabbits and is uncommon in adults.\u2022Hematochezia and melena are rarely seen in rabbits.\u2022Stomach palpation is important in distinguishing hypomotility, ingesta accumulation, and obstruction.\u25cbNormally, the stomach is readily palpated as nonpainful, soft, and supple.\u25cbIn hypomotile states, accumulated ingesta may result in a palpably enlarged stomach with doughy contents that can remain pitted when depressed, and that progress to firm noncompressible contents in more severe cases.\u25cbIn acute gastrointestinal obstruction, gastric dilatation results (air, fluid), especially on the left side caudal to the ribs.

            "text": "\n\u2022Normal transit time for ingesta through small intestine is 10 to 60 minutes.\u2022Small intestine is relatively devoid of resident microbes.\u2022Much HCO3\n\u2212 is secreted into the duodenum to neutralize acidic digesta.\u2022Terminal portion of ileum (sacculus rotundus) contains an ileocecocolic valve that prevents backflow into the ileum.\u2022Colonic transit time for cecotrophs is 1.5 to 2.5 times faster than for hard feces.\u2022Rabbits produce on average 150 hard fecal pellets per day.\u2022The cecum, the largest organ in the abdominal cavity, holds about 40% of total ingesta. Fermentation of digestible fiber and production of volatile fatty acids occur within the cecum, with resulting cecotrophs passed and re-ingested by the rabbit. Cecotrophs serve as an important source of volatile fatty acids (energy), protein, and vitamins, and are important for cecal recolonization.\u2022Diet plays a key role in gastrointestinal well-being. A healthy cecal environment is governed by many factors and relies on a steady supply of fermentable fiber substrate. Cecal microflora is predominated by Bacteroides spp.; however, a mix of aerobic and anaerobic organisms is also present, including some potentially pathogenic bacteria in small numbers (e.g., Clostridium spp.). Alterations in the cecal environment (pH and floral population) can favor the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria.\u2022The fusus coli is a section of colon (separating proximal and distal portions) that is responsible for governing colonic motility. It is particularly sensitive to catecholamines, which can produce a reduction in gut motility.\u2022Rabbit stomachs are vulnerable to dilatation (gaseous/fluid) in cases of outflow obstruction and hypomotility. With severe dilatation secondary to obstruction, compression of the caudal vena cava may impair venous return and cause significant pain.\u2022Foreign body obstruction most commonly occurs in pylorus, proximal duodenum, and distal ileum.\u2022Many factors can affect gastrointestinal motility, including dietary fiber levels, pain and stressors, phase of fecal excretion, hormonal influences (e.g., catecholamines, prostaglandins, motilin), cecal volatile fatty acid fractions, underlying diseases, medications, and activity level.\u2022Physiologic effects of reduced gut motility can include gastric dilatation/impaction, gastric ulceration, gastric trichobezoar formation, alterations in water/electrolyte secretion and absorption, hypovolemia, acid-base and electrolyte imbalance, and dehydration.\u2022Reduced food intake can rapidly result in hepatic lipidosis and ketoacidosis in rabbits.\u2022Gastrointestinal obstruction: rapid accumulation of fluid proximal to the site of an intestinal obstruction due to rabbit's inability to vomit, continual production of saliva, water secretion into stomach, and subsequent fermentation of contents can lead to severe gastric dilatation\u25cbObstruction secondary to re-ingestion of a compressed fecal hair pellet (most common) or to ingestion of other foreign bodies and tumors\u25cbCompressed hair pellets are different from trichobezoars and hairballs. Compressed hair pellets are thought to be formed after compression of ingested hair into matted pellets in the large intestine; these are then re-ingested during cecotrophy. This may occur more commonly in long-haired breeds or during moulting.\u25cbObstructions also occur secondary to ingestion of nonfood item such as fabrics and clay-based cat litters.\u25cbObstruction secondary to strictures, adhesions, intussusception, neoplasia, and extraluminal compression (e.g., abscessation, parasitic cysts, neoplasia, cystolith) is also possible.\n\u2022Cecotrophal soiling of perineum (\u201cclagging,\u201d intermittent soft stools): often misinterpreted as diarrhea. Many factors influence cecotrophy. Diet especially plays an important role, with protein and fiber levels influencing this. Increased dietary fiber levels increase the level of cecotrophy, and increased dietary protein levels reduce cecotrophy. Other physical factors affecting cecotrophy include perineal pain (urine or fecal scalding), long-haired breeds, inflexibility, arthritis, spondylosis, obesity, dental disease, restrictive confinement, conformational anomalies, anorexia, neurologic disease, and cecotroph consistency.\u2022Infection: a host of bacterial, viral, and protozoal organisms can lead to gastrointestinal disease. Many may act synergistically as co-pathogens in the enteritis complex.\u25cbProtozoal\u25aaCoccidiosis: several Eimeria spp. are pathogenic to the intestinal tract. Infection may be dose-dependent, and the region of the intestines affected may be species-specific. Younger rabbits are more commonly affected. Diarrhea produced may be hemorrhagic but usually is green/brown and odiferous. Chronic infection may result in intussusception and rectal prolapse. Hepatic coccidiosis (Eimeria stiedai) may result in secondary diarrhea caused by severe hepatic dysfunction.\u25aaCryptosporidiosis: Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium cuniculus may affect young rabbits, resulting in transitory diarrhea and growth retardation; most likely acts as a co-pathogen\u25aaFlagellates: a host of nonpathogenic normal flora found in cecum and cecotrophs (e.g., Entamoeba cuniculi, Giardia duodenalis, Monocercomonas cuniculi, Retortamonas cuniculi)\n\u25cbBacterial\u25aaClostridial enterotoxemia: most commonly due to C. spiroforme, although C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. welchii have also been implicated. Disruption of normal gut flora is considered to be an important predisposing factor (especially in adult rabbits). Low-fiber and high-carbohydrate diets and disruption of the normal cecal environment are more likely to influence disease, especially in younger (recently weaned) rabbits. Virtually all C. spiroforme isolates are toxigenic. Disease is usually severe and acute, with diarrhea, collapse, and death within 1 to 3 days. Antibiotic-associated dysbiosis of the cecum can lead to clostridial overgrowth. Avoid use of oral preparations of lincomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and penicillins.\u25aaTyzzer's disease: caused by Clostridium piliforme; seen most often in weanling rabbits, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Transmitted by ingestion of spores. Organism colonizes cecum, resulting in typhlitis, and spread via portal circulation to liver leads to hepatitis. Further systemic spread can lead to myocarditis. Acute diarrhea and sudden death may be seen. Chronic forms of the disease may result in intestinal fibrosis, stenosis, hepatonecrosis, and myocarditis.\u25aaColiform enteritis: E. coli is normally absent (or present in small numbers) in rabbit intestines. Suckling young and weaners are most susceptible (strain dependent). Enteropathogenic strains are most commonly seen in rabbits. Usually associated with concurrent disease or poor diet and act as co-pathogens. May produce yellowish diarrhea and death.\u25aaProliferative enteritis/enterocolitis: Lawsonia intracellularis infection can result in proliferation and thickening of intestines (especially ileum). Mostly affects weanling and young rabbits, resulting in acute diarrhea. Rarely causes death unless coinfection occurs (e.g., E. coli), and can be difficult to eliminate.\u25aaSalmonellosis: S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis can cause diarrhea, septicemia, and rapid death\u25aaOther bacterial infections (rare): Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas spp., Campylobacter spp., Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, Vibrio spp.\n\u25cbViral\u25aaRotavirus: infection can result in enterocolitis and diarrhea. Severity of disease depends on viral strain and presence of co-pathogens (e.g., E. coli, Eimeria spp.). Mostly seen in weanlings because maternal immunity subsides at this time.\u25aaCoronavirus: coronaviral enteritis usually affects 3- to 10-week-old rabbits, resulting in diarrhea, lethargy, abdominal distention, and death\u25aaOther viral infections (rare): adenovirus, parvovirus\n\u25cbYeasts\u25aaCecotrophs and hard feces normally contain large numbers of yeasts (e.g., Cyniclomyces guttulatus). These are considered normal florae.\n\n\u2022Nematodiasis: Passalurus ambiguus (and P. nonannulatus) often found in large numbers in cecum and colon; usually nonpathogenic in adults but may be associated with enteritis complex in young rabbits\u2022Dysautonomia: suspected neurotoxin involved in producing constellation of signs associated with dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. Anorexia, obtundation, tooth grinding, palpable cecal impaction, and passage of mucus are characteristic clinical signs. Prognosis is poor.\u2022Mucoid enteropathy: Unclear origin; may be associated with diet, co-pathogens, stressors, dysbiosis, toxins, and dysautonomia. Mostly affects weanlings and occasionally adults (usually after stressor). Diarrhea \u00b1 mucoid diarrhea features early and an impacted cecum. Stomach and small intestine may be distended with fluid and gas. Prognosis poor.\u2022Neoplasia: leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, papilloma, and polyps all reported as primary neoplasias of gastrointestinal tract; metastatic involvement of uterine adenocarcinoma also reported\u2022Toxicity: range of toxins potentially cause gastrointestinal signs (e.g., diarrhea, hypomotility) in rabbits, including lead, aflatoxins, some herbicides, and a variety of plants\u2022Neuromuscular disease: spinal disease or peripheral neuropathy can alter intestinal function and motility\u2022Inflammatory bowel disease and dietary intolerance are very rare in rabbits. An intestinal plasmacytosis has been reported in research rabbits.\u2022Megacolon syndrome of homozygous spotted rabbits: hereditary condition associated with impaired intestinal sodium absorption; increasing liquefaction of cecal and colonic contents leads to characteristic obstipation of cecum in end-stage disease\n",

Gastric axis (angle formed between center of fundus and pyloris) in lateral view should be parallel with ribs (lateral projection) and perpendicular to spine (in ventrodorsal view).\u25aaSmall intestines are typically located in the cranial abdomen dorsal to the cecum on the lateral projection and in the left cranial abdomen on the ventrodorsal projection. The jejunum can extend into the midcaudal abdomen. The small intestines may be obscured by the large bowel.\u25aaCecum typically occupies most of the right and ventral abdomen.\u25aaDistal colon and rectum can be more easily identified when spherical hard fecal balls are present.\u25aaRadiographic appearance of a rabbit's abdomen is largely affected by its current \u201cphase\u201d of digestion. During periods of cecotrophal ingestion, feeding tends to cease, and the digestive tract is relatively emptier during this phase. When ingesting food, hard feces may be evident in the colon (rabbits often ingest food and pass hard feces simultaneously). The relative difference in radiographic appearance of an individual's abdomen can alter significantly during a 24-hour cycle.\n\u25cbIn hypomotile states, accumulated gastric ingesta may be crowned by a gas halo. The stomach can normally contain small amounts of gas (gas cap), although a larger \u201ccrescenteric\u201d gas cap may be indicative of increased gas buildup. Gas accumulation may also be evident in the intestines (especially the cecum).\u25cbIn acute gastrointestinal obstruction, severe gastric dilatation results (air, fluid) with the stomach extending well beyond the rib cage. The intestines may have little gas accumulation, although a small intestinal gas pattern suggestive of foreign body obstruction may be evident. Foreign body may not be discernible radiographically.\u25cbOther organomegaly may be evident (e.g., hepatomegaly).\u25cbFree gas in abdominal cavity (gastrointestinal rupture) and abdominal effusions (e.g., peritonitis, cardiogenic) may be noted.\u25cbGastrointestinal contrast studies (e.g., pneumogastrogaphy, barium sulfate) are not usually diagnostically beneficial, carry procedural risks, and are difficult to interpret.\n\u2022Abdominal ultrasound: may be hindered by the presence of large amounts of gastrointestinal gas, although may be useful to delineate gastrointestinal disease (obstructions, intussusception, neoplasia, extraluminal compression) and other structures of other organs\u2022Radiography of skull for investigation of dental disease\u2022Radiography of spine/pelvis for investigation of musculoskeletal and neurologic disease\n",

Avoid percutaneous gastric trocarization because thin-walled stomach may rupture severely.\u25cbRelieve obstruction via exploratory laparotomy (gastrotomy/enterotomy), although short period of patient stabilization may be required before surgery.\u25cbAvoid per os medications and gut prokinetics until relief of obstruction is achieved.\n\u2022Coccidiosis: treatment via limiting access to hard feces (sporulation occurs in hard feces after about 3 days) and medicating with toltrazuril 25 mg/kg PO q 24 h \u00d7 2, repeated after 5 days\u2022Bacterial infections: based on results of culture and sensitivity testing. First-line choices include enrofloxacin 10 mg/kg PO, SC q 12 h; trimethoprim/sulfonamide 30 mg/kg PO q 12 h. For severe diarrhea, consider loperamide 0.1 mg/kg PO q 8 h.\u25cb\nC. spiroforme infection: try metronidazole 20 mg/kg PO q 12 h. Consider use of ion-exchange resin to aid in absorption of toxins (e.g., cholestyramine 0.5 g/kg PO q 12 h). Vitamin C 100 mg/kg PO, SC q 24 h may decrease toxin production/absorption.\u25cb\nL. intracellularis infection: try chloramphenicol 30-50 mg/kg PO q 8-12 h\n\n",
