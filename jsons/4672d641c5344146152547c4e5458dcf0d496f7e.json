These approaches play an important role in understanding epidemic spread patterns and evaluating policies of disease control. In general, mathematical models focus on the macroscopic regularities of epidemic spread [1] . Mathematical models make some reasonable assumptions, such as a homogeneous and well-mixed population, so as to represent the spread of epidemics at the macro level. Mathematical models also simplify the complex spreading process of epidemics. For example, only a few key factors are taken into account in mathematical models. These factors are embodied in some variables parameterized with average quantities or mean values in equations. These assumptions and simplifications endow mathematical models with the advantage of performing theoretical analysis of macroscopic regularities of epidemic diffusion, such as the epidemic threshold and final epidemic size. However, these assumptions and simplifications also limit the capability of mathematical models to represent the spread of epidemics in detail. Computational approaches make use of a wide array of simulation schemes to provide a more detailed representation of realities [4, 5] . Computational approaches usually build epidemic models, such as complex network models and agent-based models, at an individual level [6] .

To address what type of models should be used in research, we perform comparison between mathematical models, complex network models, and agentbased models in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7 Comparison of mathematical models, complex network models, and agent-based modes of epidemics Mathematical models have the advantage of performing theoretical analysis of macroscopic regularities of epidemic diffusion. Moreover, mathematical models of epidemics are easier to understand and require low computing power. However, mathematical models of epidemics are limited in describing realities in detail. Agent-based models have the advantage of capturing heterogeneity in individual attributes and behaviors, as well as the process of epidemic spread. However, agent-based models of epidemics require data availability, complex algorithms, and high computing power. Complex network models of epidemics are located somewhere between mathematical models and agent-based mod-els. Complex networks can not only be parsed using meanfield theory to build differential equations, but also be used to describe human contact patterns and build individual-based models. More comparison between mathematical models, complex network models, and agent-based models of epidemics can be found in [2, 217, 218] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1635, "end": 1638, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1643, "text": "217,", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1648, "text": "218]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 533, "end": 539, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 542, "end": 548, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Moreover, we propose some future research directions in epidemic modeling, including the spatial-temporal spreading patterns of epidemics, the heterogeneity of epidemic spread process, and the interplay between human dynamics and epidemic dynamics.

We expect these directions can guide future research in epidemic modeling.
