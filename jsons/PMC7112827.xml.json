This subset has previously been identified in a mouse model for acute influenza virus [9], and in the brain of coronavirus-infected mice [10]. In humans, a regulatory CD8+ T cell subset generated in vitro from CD8+CD28\u2212 but not from CD8+CD28+ T cells was able to inhibit T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity by secretion of IL-10 [11]. Using tetramer-sorted antigen-specific CD8+ T cells from controls and solid organ transplanted patients, controls had relatively few IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10-producing, double-positive cells, whereas EBV antigen-specific CD8+ T cells from solid organ transplanted patients produced equal levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 [12]. Although CD46 was reported to slightly increase proliferation of CD8+ T-cells as well as expression of surface markers involved in T-cell activation, it did not induce a significant increase in IFN-\u03b3 production [13]. Thus, whether CD46 exerts a co-stimulatory function in CD8+ T cells lacking CD28 remains to be fully elucidated.",

Interestingly, we observed that CD46 was a potent co-stimulatory receptor for expansion of CD8+ T-cells that secreted IFN-\u03b3, but in contrast to CD4+ T cells, CD46 did not induce an IL-10 regulatory phenotype in CD8+ T cells. This demonstrates that CD46 is a co-stimulatory receptor in CD8+ T cells, and to our knowledge provides the first example of a co-stimulatory receptor with a major qualitatively different response in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.",

Upon activation both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreted IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10, which accumulated in the supernatant as measured by ELISA. As expected, we were able to confirm a significant increase in the level of IL-10 in supernatants from CD46-co-stimulated CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2\nA). Although CD46 co-stimulation also induced the secretion of IL-10 in CD8+ T cells, the average level in the supernatant was less than 3% of that seen for CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2B). This is in accordance with an observation by Kemper et al. that CD46 was unable to induce IL-10 production in several distinct immune cell subsets, including CD8+ T cells [7]. In contrast, CD46 co-stimulation induced higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 in CD8+ T cells when compared with CD4+ T cells. These data suggest that co-stimulation of CD46 together with CD3 increases the amount of secreted IFN-\u03b3 from both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell cultures, whereas it induces IL-10 secretion mainly from CD4+ T cells. The CD46-induced IFN-\u03b3 production in CD8+ T cells was dependent on IL-2, since no or little IFN-\u03b3 levels could be detected in the absence of exogenous IL-2 (Fig. 2C). This suggests a cross talk between CD46 and IL-2R signaling, as has also been suggested for CD4+ T cells [4].",

Nevertheless, it has been reported that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are unable to switch into IL-10 production following CD46 stimulation presumably due to expression of an alternative isoform of CD46 [4]. CD46 is alternatively spliced and expressed in predominantly four isoforms. Notably, these isoforms express one of two possible intracytoplasmic tails, known as CYT-1 and CYT-2, which are thought to transmit different signals within the CD4+ T cell. CYT-1 isoforms may promote CD4+ T-cell activation, whereas CYT-2 isoforms may be involved in the contraction of the response [4,6,8]. We have previously characterized CD46 isoform expression on subsets of immune cells including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and demonstrated interindividual differences, but intraindividual similarities [18]. Thus, based on their total CD46 expression (Fig. 1A) and isoform expression pattern, it is not predicted that CD46 co-stimulation should differ between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Thus, the lack of a CD46-promoted IL-10 switch in CD8+ T cells is unlikely to be caused by expression of an alternative CD46 isoform but may be caused by other inherent differences in the induction of the IL-10 promoter between the two subsets of T cells.",

We therefore investigated whether CFSE labeled CD8+ T cells proliferated to co-stimulation by CD46 using flow cytometry. In accordance with previous observations, CD4+ T cells proliferated upon CD46 co-stimulation. Importantly, we found that CD46 co-stimulation of CD8+ T cells induced a similar proliferation of CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3\nA and B). This further suggests that CD46 indeed may function as a co-stimulatory molecule for CD8+ T cells.",

Activation of CD8+ T cells increased the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells, and the frequency was further elevated upon CD46 co-stimulation. Whereas CD46 co-stimulation of CD4+ T cells in the presence of IL-2 induced a shift to IFN-\u03b3+IL-10+ double positive cells and IL-10+ single positive cells over 3 days of culture, CD8+ T cells increased the frequency of IFN-\u03b3+ cells but did not show a shift towards production of IL-10 even in the presence of exogenous IL-2. This suggests a different function of CD46 co-stimulation in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, where CD46 co-stimulation of CD8+ T cells promotes expansion and consequently a strong IFN-\u03b3 response. In contrast, CD46 co-stimulation of CD4+ T cells promotes an IFN-\u03b3 response and a subsequent shift towards a strong IL-10 response that may act as an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism.",

This discrepancy may arise from different experimental conditions including differences in the concentration of antibodies used for in vitro activation of T cells and the use of distinct CD46 antibody clones. Whereas Kickler et al. used the antibody clone MCI20.6, which binds to an epitope in SCR1, we used M177, which binds to and epitope in SCR2. Blocking studies on adenovirus binding to CD46 demonstrated that M177 and some SCR1 binding antibodies block viral binding very efficiently, but MCI20.6 had relatively poor blocking abilities [20]. It is plausible that M177 and MCI20.6 have different binding affinities for CD46 and thus may induce signaling from CD46 with different potency.",

            "text": "In this study, we have demonstrated that CD46 exerts separate functions in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, since it promotes the differentiation of an IL-10-producing regulatory subset in Th1 cells, whereas it predominantly expands the IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8+ T cells. The apparent lack of differentiation of the CD8+ T cells may have important applications. For adoptive transfer of cellular immunotherapy, it is desirable to uncouple T-cell expansion from its differentiation [28]. We suggest that anti-CD46 should be further explored as a means to expand CD8+ T cells for such therapy.",
