Dissemination into the peritoneum and throughout the abdomen can be due to a primary peritoneal cancer or other primary malignancies that have metastasized, including (but not limited to) colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, appendiceal cancer, ovarian cancer, and mesothelioma. Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) or gynecologic malignancies with peritoneal carcinomatosis may have dismal survival due to a high disease burden within the abdominal cavity [1]. Some studies suggest the average survival for patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin is 18\u201348 months, for high-grade appendiceal adenocarcinoma 12\u201336 months, and for low-grade appendiceal neoplasms >60 months [1].",

Dr. Paul Sugarbaker, a pioneer in the management of peritoneal cancer, was instrumental in this paradigm shift and his emphasis on accurate assessment of the locoregional tumor burden helped develop the current treatment pathways that are followed today. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is now the accepted treatment for PC in select patients with acceptable disease burden from particular malignancies and a good functional status (Table 23.1) [3\u20135]. The ultimate goal of HIPEC is to destroy microscopic disease left behind after optimal CRS. As outlined by the American Society of Peritoneal Surface Malignancies, indications for CRS with HIPEC are as follows: a large volume of noninvasive peritoneal carcinomatosis or sarcomatosis, peritoneal mesothelioma, low-volume peritoneal seeding from invasive cancer, perforated GI cancer, cancer adherent to adjacent organs or structures, GI cancer with positive peritoneal cytology, GI with ovarian involvement, intraoperative tumor spill, or after systemic chemotherapy for recurrent ovarian cancer after a long disease-free interval and for palliation of patients with malignant ascites [6].",

Importantly, this must be kept in mind in the preoperative surgical planning and especially in discussion with the patient to alert them of this possibility of \u201cunderstaging\u201d with imaging (Fig. 23.1) [10].",

An extremely valuable fundamental is that the inherent movement of fluid within the abdomen deposits disease first within the right upper quadrant/right subdiaphragmatic peritoneum, followed by the left subphrenic space. In the lower abdomen, the rectovaginal pouch/pouch of Douglas is the initial collection space, followed by deposits around the urinary bladder then the paracolic gutters.",

In 2010, a multicenter French study reported by Elias et al. looked at the role of the PCI in patients with colorectal carcinomatosis treated with surgery and HIPEC [14]. In this study it was shown that as the PCI increased above 20 in patients with CRC and PC, the survival dramatically declined despite having undergone CRS and HIPEC at an experienced center. In fact, in this data, there were no 5-year survivors if the PCI was greater than 20, yet in those patients with a PCI of 1\u20136, the 5-year survival was over 40% with a median survival of 40 months [14]. At out our center we most often decline patients with PC from CRC and other invasive malignancies for HIPEC if the PCI is greater than 20. However, even if patients with invasive cancer have a PCI less than 20 that is not an absolute indication to proceed with CRS and HIPEC. An example of this is in patients with an unresectable volume of tumor localized in one area, such as the porta hepatis; although the PCI is low, complete cytoreduction may not be possible and these patients generally should not be considered for HIPEC.",

Multiple studies have shown improved survival in patients who had undergone complete cytoreduction for appendiceal, colorectal, and gastric cancers [11]. It is a good prognostic indicator for many different histopathologies. We urge that all patients who undergo cytoreduction should have the benefit of a team that can and always aims to achieve a complete cytoreduction. Complete cytoreduction versus incomplete cytoreduction are the main determinants. A CCR of 0 is achieved when there is no peritoneal seeding visualized within the abdomen after cytoreduction [11]. CCR 1 occurs when nodules <2.5 mm persist after CRS [11]. A CCR 2 has residual nodules between 2.5 mm and 2.5 cm, and a CCR 3 indicates nodules >2.5 cm [11]. In order to proceed with HIPEC we advise a CCR of 0 or 1. This is due to the finding that the CCR-1 tumor size (but not CCR-2 and above) is thought to be penetrable by intraperitoneal chemotherapy, thus allowing HIPEC to complete the surgical cytoreduction. Furthermore, Sugarbaker and others have shown that the chance of survival for patients with a CCR 0 from a CRC with PC who underwent HIPEC to be 40% at 5 years, yet 0% survived 5 years when cytoreduction was incomplete (CCR 2 and above) [15].",

It becomes imperative to have preoperative optimization of these morbidities. Particular attention should be paid to patients with previous cardiac medical history. The adverse effects and risk of general anesthetic effects on cardiac function are well documented. The anesthesiologist must also take into account the duration of the procedure and the effects of hypothermia and hyperthermia. The prolonged anesthetic exposure provides additional risk. Published studies demonstrate a range of operative times for CRS + HIPEC from 433 to 470 minutes [18\u201320]. Patients with previous coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or depressed left ventricular function may not be able to tolerate prolonged or aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation [2]. Hyperthermia-induced increases in myocardial oxygen demand can cause devastating hemodynamic compromise [2]. The American Heart Association guidelines remain the accepted standard evaluation for preoperative cardiac assessment [2].",

Furthermore, the experience of the anesthesia team can help improve quality and outcomes. Hemodynamic monitoring is essential for intraoperative monitoring and patient safety. We advocate the use of arterial line for accurate blood pressure monitoring and selective use of central line placement for rapid administration of fluid, blood products, or inotropic support, if necessary. Some institutions do not routinely advocate the use of central line placement and we make this decision on a case-to-case basis. Although measurement of central venous pressure (CVP) does not accurately reflect volume status [2], central venous access improves the ease of serial lab draws: complete blood count, basic metabolic profile/complete metabolic profile, and coagulation studies. Close monitoring of such values allows prompt intervention and resuscitation if needed. Central lines expose the patient to potential risk: mechanical injury (pneumothorax, hematoma, bleeding, foreign body retention) and infection [2]. Other methods of estimating volume responsiveness include beat-to-beat changes in stroke volume (SV) induced by positive pressure ventilation (PPV) [2]. A small SV variation (12\u201313%) can indicate volume responsiveness or euvolemia [2]. We do not routinely use a pulmonary artery catheter (Swan Ganz), however, we have employed its use in thoracoabdominal HIPEC cases and when a patient has a marked preoperative cardiac history. Most recently we have employed the use of noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring systems, mainly esophageal Doppler monitoring, which has been selectively studied and used in the management of patients undergoing HIPEC. Our initial results show benefit in terms of limiting volume replacement during the intraoperative course and we plan to analyze this more closely.",

It becomes tempting to administer large amounts of crystalloid fluid in response to changes in the central venous pressures (CVP) or \u201cthird space\u201d losses. This method can result in increased postoperative complications: pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), impaired healing of anastomoses, and dilution of coagulation factors and platelets, which could result in a clinically significant coagulopathy [2]. There is good documentation that the judicious use of intraoperative fluid(s) improves outcomes after major gastrointestinal surgery [23]. Frequent laboratory draws, urine output, heart rate, ventilator parameters, stroke volume, cardiac output, and other means can all be used to provide a reasonable picture of patient status during the CRS and HIPEC. Targeted resuscitation should be emphasized with use of crystalloid fluid, synthetic colloid, and human-derived colloid (blood products). Average estimated blood loss (EBL) at our institution is approximately 240 mL, with literature citing an average EBL 300\u2013500 mL [2]. However, with any large hemorrhage (>500 mL), volume replacement with blood products should be discussed. Additional consideration for this patient population is decreased oncotic pressure that may occur secondary to a loss in protein from surgically removed ascites. The use of synthetic colloid as replacement may need to be considered. The restrictive use of fluids during HIPEC has recently translated into improved postoperative outcomes, however, it should be stressed that adequate resuscitation and renal perfusion must also be achieved during the perfusion.",

Dopamine was once thought to provide a nephron-protective effect by stimulation of the DA1 receptors (renal vasodilation and inhibition of proximal tubule active sodium transport) [24]. However, this is now less accepted and administration of dopamine during HIPEC is not advocated by the consensus guidelines [22]. However, we use low-dose dopamine during the perfusion in the majority of cases, but acknowledge the potential lack of benefit. If increased diuresis is needed despite adequate intravascular volume and renal perfusion, the administration of furosemide can provide additional diuresis [2].

DL allows the surgeon to calculate the extent of disease and assess tumor burden, and determine the PCI and extent of resection needed to achieve CCR or 0/1 with less operative time, less morbidity and mortality compared to a laparotomy. DL has demonstrated multiple strengths: evaluation of small bowel mesentery, through evaluation of all regions of the PCI scoring regions; evaluation of the omental bursa, pelvic cavity, diaphragm, and abdominal wall; and allow for peritoneal washings and biopsies if needed to determine the course of treatment [10]. Its areas of inherent weakness pertain to evaluation of the thickness of diaphragmatic lesions and evaluation of pancreatic or lesser sac involvement; however, with the use of intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound these challenges could be overcome [10].",

Bowel preparation is usually not required. The patient is placed under general anesthetic with endotracheal intubation. Typically, patients previously have had (multiple) gastrointestinal surgical procedures; therefore using the Hasson technique to enter the abdomen is most safe in our experience. Location of entry is based on surgeon preference: periumbilical, right or left flank, right or left iliac fossa, midaxillary line, or left upper quadrant (our preferred site of entry) [10]. In our approach, once the fascia is grasped and incised, great care should be taken to dissect away any adhesions avoiding bowel injury; and once deemed safe, a large-diameter blunt Hasson port (10\u201312 mm) should be inserted gently and secured. Ascites should be evacuated prior to pneumoperitoneum being established [10]. If the patient has a large amount of ascites, pneumoperitoneum may be difficult to obtain without high intra-abdominal pressures. Some of these patients will be able to tolerate higher pressures due to chronic domain expansion due to ascites; however, the surgeon must be astute to subtle hemodynamic changes to indicate hemodynamic compromise and stop the procedure.",

These three locations are sites where the bowel and retroperitoneum have a particularly strong attachment with less peristalsis of the visceral peritoneum allowing more time for tumor deposition [29]. A complete pelvic peritonectomy is most often required: stripping of all sidewalls, peritoneum overlying the bladder, the cul-de-sac, and resection of the rectosigmoid colon [29]. Resection of the ileocecal valve along with the distal most terminal ileum is often required [29]. The pylorus of the stomach is fixed to the retroperitoneum, and tumor may collect in the subpyloric space via the foramen of Winslow [29].

This leaves the anterior peritoneum intact and a small peritoneal window at the superior aspect of the incision can be created (Fig. 23.7). This will allow the surgeon to inspect and palpate the anterior parietal peritoneum and assess if a total or partial anterior parietal peritonectomy is needed [29]. Dissection should continue superiorly to the undersurface of the hemidiaphragm(s) down toward the paracolic gutters [10]. The section of the parietal peritoneum in closest attachment with the underlying tissue is along the transverses muscle. Dissection is more difficult here compared to the looser connections along lines of Toldt along the paracolic sulcus [10]. If cancer nodules are palpated, a complete anterior peritonectomy is required; if no nodules are palpated, then the anterior peritoneum can be maintained with only regional resections.",

Dissection continues with electrocautery to separate the peritoneum from the diaphragm, left adrenal gland, and superior portion of the perinephric tissue [29]. The splenic flexure of the colon should be mobilized medially by transection of the peritoneum along the lines of Toldt [29]. The stomach (after ligation and transection of all of the short gastric arteries) can be reflected medially to allow visualization of the left adrenal gland, pancreas, the anterior surface of the transverse mesocolon, and perinephric tissues [29]. The left lateral liver should be mobilized, with care not to injure the inferior phrenic vein, which can be ligated and divided if needed to perform inclusive peritonectomy. At this point we also incise the pars flaccida to allow access to the lesser omentum and caudate liver, which should be explored thoroughly. Blood vessels that are encountered during dissection of the diaphragm should be well controlled prior to division, for these vessels tend to retract into the diaphragm muscle, which can be a source for ongoing hemorrhage [29].",

Dissection should be continued in the same manner, using high voltage 3 mm ball tip electrocautery, taking care to control all vessels encountered. To ensure complete peritonectomy, mobilization of the liver must be extensive and gentle downward retraction should be used so as to not damage the liver or its vascular attachments. The right peritonectomy is continued until the bare area of the liver is reached [29]. The peritoneum should be followed onto the liver surface as Glisson\u2019s capsule. All of the capsule and associated tumor should be removed. It is possible to remove a thick layer of tumor with little blood loss by using electrocautery beneath Glisson\u2019s capsule [29]. Complete removal of the falciform ligament, most importantly at this area of hepatic attachment, is necessary. Not only is tumor deposition along the falciform ligament encountered, but at its entrance in the hepatic parenchyma it is covered in peritoneum, creating a tunnel with potential tumor deposition [29]. In some patients a bridge of hepatic tissue covers the entrance; this bridge must be divided to allow full inspection of this area of peritoneum [29]. This is often in close proximity to the left hepatic artery, so careful, direct dissection must occur [29]. See Fig. 23.8 for right upper quadrant peritonectomy intraoperative and completion.",

Pelvic peritonectomy begins with resection of the peritoneum from the inferior aspect of the abdominal incision. Dissection is continued to the right and left borders of the bladder [29]. The peritoneum overlying the surface of the bladder is stripped away to the level of the cervix or seminal vesicles while counter traction is placed on the urachus [29]. The proper plane for dissection is between the musculature of the bladder and its overlying fatty tissue [29]. Both uterine arteries are ligated close to the base of the bladder, just above the ureters [29]. Laterally, the peritoneum is continuous with the peritoneum of the right and left paracolic sulci [29]. Care must be taken not to damage the ureters. In females, the round ligament is identified and ligated as it enters the internal inguinal ring [29]. Both ovarian veins are ligated at the level of the lower pole of the kidney [29]. If tumor burden is present beyond local resection, the rectosigmoid colon is formally resected just distal to the pelvic tumor [29]. Electrocautery is used to excise the mesorectum circumferentially [29]. Exposure of the rectovaginal septum is then achieved by dissecting the bladder away from the cervix where the anterior and posterior vaginal cuff is transected [29]. The perirectal adipose is divided beneath the peritoneal reflection to ensure removal of all tumor within the cul-de-sac [29]. See Fig. 23.9 for pelvic peritonectomy.",

Mucosa and submucosa are left intact and the seromuscular layer is repaired primarily [29]. These nodules are preferentially removed via scissor dissection. Type 3 nodules are large enough that a full-thickness resection of the antimesenteric bowel wall is needed [29]. The defect is repaired in a two-layered fashion. Type 4 nodules can undergo localized resection or segmental small bowel resection pending the size (of the nodule) and vascular supply [29]. A two-layered repair follows the localized resection, and a hand sewn end-to-end or stapled side-to-side small bowel anastomoses are performed for segmental resection. Type 5 nodules require a formal small bowel resection with associated mesentery (Fig. 23.10) [29]. The section of small bowel and mesentery that is resected is divided with a linear stapler.",

The grade of the appendiceal tumor is of utmost importance, and in general all low-grade mucinous neoplasms of the appendix may be treated with debulking and HIPEC if needed. We know that this group of patients, if optimally cytoreduced and administered HIPEC, has the best prognoses with median survival exceeding 10 years in most series. This is highly dependent on the grade of the neoplasm and perhaps even the molecular profile of the tumor, as even low-grade tumors with certain molecular mutations may behave aggressively. High-grade neoplasms, as defined by Misradji, can behave as an aggressive invasive malignancy. Thus, the management of high- and low-grade appendiceal mucinous tumors may differ depending on the clinical presentation. When we evaluate a patient with a low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN), the expected thorough evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, laboratory evaluation (including CEA, CA 19-9, and CA-125), review of operative and pathology notes, imaging (CT, MRI, PET), and functional performance status. Some general, although not completely inclusive, principles can help define the course of treatment (Table 23.7).",

Traumatic release from surgical manipulation also contributes to intraperitoneal free cancer cells [40]. These cells are released from surrounding lymphatic channels, blood loss within the surgical field, and resection margins [40]. The number of peritoneal lavage specimens positive for malignant cells doubled after gastrectomy (24% before, 58% after) [43]. Cells released adhere to exposed surgical surfaces within minutes due to the local release of cytokines, fibrin, and other adhesion molecules [44].

Asbestos fibers trigger a foreign body reaction with subsequent inflammatory response. The ferritin heavy chain present in the asbestos fibers creates reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. The accumulation of these actions results in genetic disruption leading to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BAP-1 [60]. The asbestos is inhaled, expectorated, and swallowed. In cases without asbestos exposure, an oncogenic virus (i.e., the simian vacuolating virus\u2014SV40) has been implicated, although more data is needed to affirm any relationship [2].",

Doxorubicin has multiple features making it a good choice for HIPEC: high molecular weight, no dose-limiting toxicity (when used intraperitoneal), tumor sequestration, and thermal enhancement [38]. A point to highlight is the tumor sequestration feature of this drug. Doxorubicin will preferentially infiltrate tumor cells, despite underlying pathology [38]. It makes predicting intra-tumor concentration based on sample of peritoneal fluid difficult; however, this may result in improved efficacy of intraperitoneal administration [38]. More research is needed to discover the mechanism. The other commonly used drugs, cisplatin and mitomycin C, have been discussed elsewhere. Pemetrexed is another drug being studied for user in MPM. Pemetrexed has excellent systemic activity against mesothelioma and may be a potential agent [38]. Currently, there is no evidence suggesting a survival advantage with use of any specific drug.",

Prognosis is determined by the amount of residual disease after CRS, with most gynecologic oncology surgeons aiming to remove all visible disease (<1 cm) [2]. Some argue that there may be a greater chance for complete CRS if chemotherapy is administered and used to decrease the volume of disease and ascites [2]. This may improve preoperative performance status (PS), shorten the length of operation, and decrease operative morbidity [2]. Some studies demonstrated a survival advantage for patients who underwent initial CRS followed by chemotherapy (versus initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy), while a European study showed similar survival for women with Stage IIIC and IV disease [2, 63, 64]. Patients who had suboptimal CRS (>2 cm residual disease) had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after delivery of a platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy versus those who had optimal CRS (<1 cm residual disease) [2]. Those with suboptimal CRS had PFS of 14.1 months and OS of 26.3 months, while those with optimal CRS had PFS of 18.3\u201323.8 months and OS of 48.7\u201365.6 months [2]. Studies have suggestive that survival may be up to 106 months if no visible disease remains at the end of CRS [2]. The addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapeutic regimens, for front-line treatment, has shown no significant increases in PFS or OS [2].",

The use of serial tumor markers is difficult; one study suggested that if preoperative CEA and CA19-9 are elevated, then an elevated postoperative CA19-9 was predictive of recurrence [74]. This does not predict the volume of disease, disease stabilization, full or partial responses [75]. Magnetic resonance imagining can detect tumor recurrence earlier than tumor markers for appendiceal neoplasms [76]. Postoperatively, patients underwent surveillance MRI and tumor markers every 6 months; recurrence was identified on average 13 months postoperatively [76]. Of the patients identified by MRI, 37% were identified to have normal tumor marker levels [76]. Tumor markers identified half as many patients with disease recurrence compared to MRI [76]. More studies are needed to evaluate imaging modalities for other pathologies. Generally, imaging should be performed at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively and yearly after that.",

Elias and colleagues carried out a prospective study to analyze outcomes of a second-look laparotomy 1 year after initial CRS + HIPEC [4]. All patients included in this group were found to have high-risk features at the original operation: previous-limited PC, resected ovarian metastases, and a perforated primary lesion [4]. Patients were asymptomatic and without evidence of disease (tumor markers, clinical exam, MRI, CT, PET scan) [4]. When the second look laparotomy was performed, 55% of patients were found to have visible PC [4]. These patients underwent CRS + HIPEC, and 12 months from the second look operation 50% were found to be disease free [4]. Although more trials and data are needed, this demonstrates that a planned second look laparotomy with intent for complete CRS + HIPEC may be of some benefit to select patients.",

There are few studies that explore the QoL in the postoperative period. The majority of these studies are single-center reviews that use validated questionnaires not specific for CRS + HIPEC [77]. When administered at the time of surgery and 3, 6, 9, or 12 months postoperatively, most patients demonstrate a return to an acceptable performance status between 3 and 24 month, with a return to baseline at 6\u201324 months postoperatively [77]. Studies demonstrate a lag in recovery of mental health while social functioning returned to baseline status 3 months postoperatively [77]. With such quick returns to an acceptable PS, one may extrapolate that patients may continue to improve beyond baseline at 6, 9, or 12 months postoperatively [77].",
