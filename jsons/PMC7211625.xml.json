These viruses are enveloped, single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses and the genome of these coronaviruses ranges from 26 to 32 kilobases in length. Coronaviruses infect humans as well as other animals such as murine, porcine, feline, bovine, avian and are known to cause acquired acute upper respiratory tract infections and severe respiratory infections in children and adults (Su et al., 2016; Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005; Masters and Perlman, 2013). Seven different human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are identified i.e., HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 cause common cold in immunocompromised individuals and other two viruses, such as \u2013 severe cute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause severe respiratory diseases (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Hamre and Procknow, 1966; Drosten et al., 2003; Zaki et al., 2012). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the recent pandemic all over the world, is the seventh strain known to infect human and causes the lethal coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).",

This experiment was carried out to design novel epitope-based vaccine against four proteins of SARS-CoV-2 i.e., nucleocapsid phosphoprotein which is responsible for genome packaging and viral assembly (Chang et al., 2014); surface glycoprotein that is responsible for membrane fusion event during viral entry (Petit et al., 2005; Cavanagh, 1995); ORF3a protein that is responsible for viral replication, characterized virulence, viral spreading and infection (Siu et al., 2019) and membrane glycoprotein which mediates the interaction of virions with cell receptors (Rottier, 1995) using the approaches of reverse vaccinology.",

In reverse vaccinology, the tools of bioinformatics are used for identifying and analyzing these novel antigens. These tools are used to dissect the genome and genetic makeup of a pathogen for developing a potential vaccine. Reverse vaccinology approach of vaccine development also allows the scientists to easily understand the antigenic segments of a virus or pathogen that should be given more emphasis during the vaccine development. This method is a quick, cheap, efficient, easy and cost-effective way to design vaccine. These methods have been successfully been used for developing vaccines to fight against many viruses i.e., the Zika virus, Chikungunya virus etc. (Chong and Khan, 2019; Mar\u00eda et al., 2017).",

To carry out the vaccine construction, four candidate proteins of the virus were identified and selected from the NCBI database. Only highly antigenic sequences were selected for further analysis since the highly antigenic proteins can induce better immunogenic response (Demkowicz et al., 1992).

The extinction coefficient can be defined as the amount of light that is absorbed by a particular compound at a certain wavelength. Surface glycoprotein had the highest predicted extinction co-efficient of 148960 M\u22121 cm\u22121. The aliphatic index of a protein corresponds to the relative volume occupied by the aliphatic amino acids in the side chains of the protein, for example: alanine, valine etc. (Pace et al., 1995; Gill and Von Hippel, 1989; Ikai, 1980; Ullah et al., 2020b). Surface glycoprotein also had the highest predicted aliphatic index among the two proteins (84.67). For this reason, surface glycoprotein had greater amount of aliphatic amino acids in its side chain than the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The grand average of hydropathicity value (GRAVY) for a protein is calculated as the sum of hydropathy values of all the amino acids of the protein, divided by the number of residues in its sequence. The negative GRAVY value represents hydrophilic characteristic and the positive GRAVY value represents hydrophobic characteristic of a compound (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982; Chang and Yang, 2013). Surface glycoprotein had the highest predicted GRAVY value of -0.079 among the two proteins. Since both of the proteins had the predicted negative GRAVY value, both of them were considered to be hydrophilic. Moreover, both of them had the predicted in vivo half-life of 30 h and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein had the highest theoretical pI of 10.07. Both the proteins showed quite good results in the physicochemical property analysis.",

T-cell and B-cell are the two main types of cells that function in immunity. When an antigen is encountered in the body by the immune system, the antigen presenting cells or APC like macrophage, dendritic cell etc. present the antigen to the T-helper cell, through the MHC class-II molecules on their surface. The helper T-cell contains CD4+ molecule on its surface, for this reason, it is also known as CD4 + T-cell. On the other hand, other type of T-cell, cytotoxic T-cell contains CD8+ molecule on their surface, for which, they are called CD8+ T-cell. MHC class-I molecules present antigens to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. After activation by the antigen, the T-helper cell activates the B-cell, which starts to produce large amount of antibodies. Macrophage and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell are also activated by the T-helper cell that cause the final destruction of the target antigen (Goerdt and Orfanos, 1999; Tanchot and Rocha, 2003; Pavli et al., 1993; Arpin et al., 1995; Cano and Lopera, 2013). The possible T-cell and B-cell epitopes of the selected proteins were determined by the IEDB (https://www.iedb.org/) server. The epitopes with high antigenicity, non-allergenicity and non-toxicity were selected to vaccine construction. The B-cell epitopes (predicted by the server) that were more than ten amino acids long were taken into consideration and the antigenic and non-allergenic epitopes were selected for vaccine construction. However, most of the epitopes were found to be residing within the cell membrane.",

On the other hand, CV-3 had the highest amount of amino acids in the alpha-helix formation (37.8 %), according to the prediction by the study. However, all the three vaccine constructs had most of their amino acids in their coil structures.

CV-2 also showed good result 90.0 % of the amino acids in the most favoured region.

With the lowest and best results generated by the MM-GBSA study, HawkDock server and ClusPro 2.0 server, CV-1 was considered as the best vaccine construct among the three vaccines. For this reason, CV-1 was selected for molecular dynamics simulation study, codon adaptation and in silico coding study. The molecular dynamics simulation study was conducted by the online tool iMODS (http://imods.chaconlab.org/) revealed that the TLR-8-CV-1 docked complex should be quite stable with a good eigenvalue of 3.817339e-06. The complex had less chance of deformation and for this reason, the complex should be quite stable in the biological environment. The Fig. 9\nf shows that a good number of amino acids were in the correlated motion that were marked by red color. Finally, codon adaptation and in silico cloning experiments were performed and with the predicted CAI value of 1.0, it could be concluded that the DNA sequence should have very high amount of favorable codons that should be able to express the desired amino acids in the target microorganism, E. coli strain K12. The DNA sequence also had quite high and good amount of GC content of 51.34 %.
