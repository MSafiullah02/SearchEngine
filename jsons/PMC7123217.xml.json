Because it is an easier problem than 3D structure prediction (more than 40 years of history) and accurate secondary structure prediction can be important information for the tertiary structure prediction. Ever since the first work of prediction of secondary structure done by Chou-Fasman, it has been 30 years. The accuracy is around 60 %. Since 1990s, several machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied to the prediction of protein secondary structure and the accuracy reaches 70 %. From this, we can see a good method can help improve the prediction result significantly.",
