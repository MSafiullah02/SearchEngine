Molecular testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows rapid detection of RVs with high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, multiplex assays enable the detection of multiple RVs in a single test, and these are now the current standard of care in many clinical settings. The purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiologic characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of vRTI in allo-HSCT recipients in the era of molecular testing.",

Conditioning intensity was defined in accordance with Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research guidelines [13]. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was defined as an RV detected in an upper respiratory tract fluid specimen together with symptoms and/or signs, with the exclusion of other possible causes. LRTI was defined as detection of RV in respiratory secretions, preferentially in samples obtained from sites of involvement together with pathological sputum production, hypoxia, or pulmonary infiltrates [14]. Progression to LRTI was defined as the onset of LRTI in patients with a previous URTI. An episode of infection was defined as evidence of RV, URTI, or LRTI detected during the conditioning period and for up to 100 days following allo-HSCT. An infection was considered subsequent if the RV detected was nonidentical or if it was identified at least 30 days following the previous episode with the identical RV [15]. The presence of a copathogen was defined as a bacterial, fungal, or nonrespiratory virus pathogen isolated from a respiratory tract sample during an episode of infection. Overall mortality was defined as death due to any cause within 100 days of vRTI diagnosis or allo-HSCT. Death attributable to vRTI was defined as death resulting from respiratory failure with other causes excluded.",

Up to 17% of vRTI episodes necessitated ICU admission and 14% required the use of mechanical ventilation, percentages consistent with previous reports 24, 25, 26. Overall, close to 40% of patients had LRTI on initial presentation. Progression to LRTI occurred in 31% of infections, most commonly involving rhinovirus. Progression to LRTI was also observed in 25% of RSV URTI episodes, a higher rate than reported previously [28]. Both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, particularly neutrophils and cytotoxic T cells, play integral roles in the defense against vRTI [19]. Th1-dominant responses, mediated by IFN-\u03b3, appear to have a protective role in RSV infections, whereas Th2 responses may be associated with more severe disease manifestations [29]. The profound immune depletion and impaired immune responses seen in the acute period following transplantation could account for the rates of initial LRTI and progression seen even with respiratory viruses considered less pathogenic, such as rhinoviruses. In addition, our cohort had a lower rate of antiviral therapy for RSV. Because we did not evaluate pulmonary function test results, the risk for vRTI and later complications, such as airway disease, as shown previously by Erard et al. [30], could not be assessed.",

As such, rhinovirus as a cause of vRTI and its burden in the study may be overestimated. Furthermore, because in this study we examined only prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of vRTI within 100 days following transplantation our results might be not translatable beyond this time frame. However, because this is a known high-risk period 23, 31, our study focused on this time frame to highlight the importance of early preventive measures and infection control measures among patients as well as healthcare workers following transplantation.",
