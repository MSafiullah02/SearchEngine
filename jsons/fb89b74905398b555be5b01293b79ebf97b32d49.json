This study investigated the application of two major clinical strategies, non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), in the first episode of acute RF. Data from the longitudinal health insurance database, which included 1,000,000 insured citizens, were used. The NIV group consisted of 1201 patients and the IMV group consisted of 16,072 patients. Chi-square test and t test were applied to determine the differences in categorical and continuous variables. Further analysis was performed by using univariate and multivariable logistic regression and Poisson regression. There was a significant increase of 733% in the number of NIV users from 2000 to 2012. NIV use was frequently observed in old-age persons (aOR 3.99, 95% CI 3.06-5.21 for those aged \u2265 80 years), women (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.18-1.50), patients admitted to a high-level hospital (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.63\u22122.34 for those admitted to a medical center), and patients with a higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI, aOR 1.38\u22121.66 for those CCI \u2265 2). In addition, patients with chronic pulmonary disease, cancer, and congestive heart failure were predominant in NIV users and were significantly associated with NIV use. Overall, the use of NIV has markedly increased over the past few years. Persons of advanced age, women, patients admitted to a high-level hospital, and patients with multiple comorbidities were associated with more frequent NIV use. Chronic pulmonary disease, cancer, and congestive heart failure were most important comorbidities for NIV use.",

Third-level hospitals are local community hospitals with less health care personnel and resources, indicating district hospitals. The CCI was defined based on Charlson's and Devo's reports [16, 17] . The detailed comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, myocardial infraction, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hemiplegia or paraplegia, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, peptic ulcer disease, renal disease, rheumatic disease, cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).

In contrast, patients comorbid with a medical history of renal disease (aOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.48\u22120.74) and liver disease (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50\u22120.85) had a significantly lower NIV choice. In addition, we also presented the association between NIV and NIV-associated factors stratified by (presence or absence of) cancer history. The most notable finding was that the impact of increasing age on NIV choice was weakened (aOR 1, 0.92, 1.20, and 2.06 in model 1 and aOR 1, 0.91, 1.06, 1.62 in model 2) in patients with a history of cancer but strengthened (aOR 1, 1.37, 2.80, and 6.53 in model 1 and aOR 1, 1.32, 2.36, 5.11 in model 2) in patients with no cancer history (Supplementary data). Table 3 shows the most frequent associated discharge diagnoses with acute RF in the NIV group (No. = 22, > 2%). We categorized these associated disorders into four groups: (1) possible cause of RF, (2) comorbidity, (3) co-existing acute illness, and (4) Table 4 ). Stratified analysis for the presence of cancer history showed that patients with cancer in the NIV group had a higher mortality rate at discharge (77.4% vs. 62.6%) and within 90 days (89.7% vs. Table 4 ).",

            "text": "Cumulative evidence has shown that the use of NIV has markedly increased over the past few decades. In a recent review, NIV is suggested for application in broad conditions in acute RF: (1) to prevent endotracheal intubation; (2) as an alternative to IMV; (3) as a tool for facilitating early weaning from IMV; or (4) as palliative care in do not resuscitate (DNR) patients [18] . The indications for NIV have also been extended, such as for immunocompromised patients and patients with chest trauma, post-operative lung resection, community-acquired pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and terminal stage diseases (palliative care) [7] [8] [9] 18] . The improvement of intensive monitoring and care, the application of integrated therapeutic tools, and expert integrated teams all contribute to the increased use of NIV. Among the abovementioned indications for NIV, palliative use may contribute an important role for NIV application. In this study, the extremely elderly and patients with cancer comprised a very high proportion (52.0% of those aged \u2265 80 years and 25.8% of those with a history of cancer) of NIV users, and cancer occupied the second place among the associated discharge diagnoses in NIV users. This phenomenon may be influenced by the administration of palliative care for individuals with extremely old age and advanced stage of cancer [19] [20] [21] [22] . Palliative NIV could be administered either to offer a chance for survival or to alleviate the symptoms of respiratory distress in terminally ill patients [19] . The use of NIV in patients with dyspnea in terminal states remains controversial, but it is reportedly effective in reducing dyspnea and in decreasing the dose of morphine in palliative use in patients with end-stage cancer [21] . One of the primary benefits of using NIV in this setting is the preservation of communication between the patient and the family. This technique is also widely used in patients with acute RF and in a DNR order, particularly for the extremely elderly [22] . Unfortunately, information on the number of persons who had DNR orders or received hospice care was absent from the database. The role or exact proportion of palliative NIV in all NIV users should be clarified in further research.",

In general, NIV is applied for patients with low disease severity; therefore, we believe that palliative NIV plays a vital role in clinical practice. We further conducted a stratified analysis of the presence of cancer history and found that patients with cancer who had received NIV treatment had a much higher mortality rate than patients who had received IMV treatment. By contrast, no difference was found in the mortality rates of patients without cancer between the NIV and IMV groups. This finding supported our hypothesis because palliative NIV was applied in a considerable number of patients with and without cancer. However, the exact proportion of palliative NIV users in this study was unknown. The application of palliative NIV for non-cancer patients needs further investigation. The strength of this study is that it is a nationwide population-based investigation evaluating the application of NIV and IMV in the first episode of acute RF. The NHI program in Taiwan covers more than 99.5% of the population. This universal coverage has reduced the barriers to healthcare access for all citizens, irrespective of the socioeconomic background and the residential location [23] . In the present study, a real-world scenario has been depicted, wherein all diagnoses and medical practices were directly made during a medical consultation.",

Some people may have repeated episodes of acute RF and would have received different opinions regarding treatment. Second, we excluded the overlapping use of NIV and IMV as we could not differentiate the time sequence of NIV and IMV use in the database. Clinically, IMV can be used after NIV for the management of disease progression, and NIV can be used after IMV for post-extubation support. Third, the cause of acute RF was unavailable in the database. We attempted to apply associated discharge diagnoses to overcome this limitation, but only minimal success was achieved. We could only categorize these associated diagnoses into four groups: possible cause of RF, comorbidity, co-existing acute illness, and uncertain acute or chronic condition. Fourth, disease severity such as the degree of hypoxemia and hypercapnia and the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) score were unavailable. The APACHE score is associated with patients' prognosis and in-hospital mortality [24] . We could only collect CCI data to represent the overall degree of severity. Finally, we were unable to identify patients with DNR orders or who received palliative and hospice care. Therefore, the results of the present study must be interpreted with caution.",
