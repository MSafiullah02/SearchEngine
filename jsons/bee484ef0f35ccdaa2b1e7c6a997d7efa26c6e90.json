Under non-intervention, peak caseload is maximised, but no differences are observed in infection rates across poor and non-poor. When we introduce different forms of social distancing interventions, peak caseloads are reduced, but infection rates of the poor are systematically higher than for non-poor across all scenarios. Larger populations, higher fractions of poor, and greater intensity of interventions are found to progressively worsen outcomes for the poor, vis-\u00e0-vis the non-poor. Increasing population leads to higher infection rates among the poor, supporting concerns that households in large high-density settlements like slums amongst the most at-risk population groups during an outbreak. Related to this, increasing population of the urban poor is found to worsen infection outcomes of the poor, and given the expansion of developing cities into large metropolises, this is an issue of significant concern for public health and economic wellbeing. The poor are also found disproportionately affected by increasing length and intensity of social distancing measures, pointing to the immediate need for countries to have clear guidelines on how social distancing can be practiced in high density slum settlements, given local contexts. Sustainable solutions for the long-term will require concerted investment in environmental and physical infrastructure to improve living conditions. Finally, addressing these iniquitous outcomes for the poor creates better outcomes for the whole population, including the non-poor.",

Non-pharmaceutical strategies to combat COVID-19 cover the entire spectrum of what is termed 'social distancing'which is a set of methods to reduce frequency and closeness of contact between people to contain the spread of disease [1] . Some nations have issued advisories advocating that people maintain a minimum distance between each other while daily life goes on largely uninterrupted, while others have banned all large gatherings and enforced distancing norms more strictly, and yet others have even gone into 'lockdown' mode, requiring people to stay home and only allowing them to venture to get basic supplies [2] . While the current viral spread is being termed a pandemic, most outbreaks are much more restricted to specific geographical locations, particularly in urban areas with greater contact density [3] . From the perspective of developing nations, therefore, attention needs to be focused upon the inability of large sections of the urban population to follow norms of social distancing given their living contexts in highly congested cities.",

            "text": "This concern primarily stems from the nature of dwelling arrangements in developing cities, where a large proportion of the population lives in densely populated slums and shantytowns [4] . Broadly, slums are defined as \"communities characterized by insecure residential status, poor structural quality of housing, overcrowding, and inadequate access to safe water, sanitation, and other infrastructure\" [5] . UN-Habitat estimated that over a third of the urban population lived in slums in 2012-13, with significant geographical heterogeneitythe proportion was 62% for sub-Saharan Africa and 35% for southern Asia, and 25% for Latin America [4] . It is possible that we will even see increasing proportions of urban dwellers living in slums, given that global growth in urban population over the next few decades will occur primarily in Asia and Africa [6, 7] . The sheer scale of slums is further exacerbated by the density of population in such settlements. Data from the World Bank reveals that average global population density is 60/ 2 [8] . However, urban regions in general have much higher densities, with cities in the developing world like Mumbai, Accra, Dhaka, and Hyderabad showing population densities of 20,700/ 2 , 27,750/ 2 , 29,070/ 2 , and 10,480/ 2 respectively [9] . Within these urban centres, slums have population densities sometimes an order of magnitude greater than cities they are located infor instance, Dharavi in Mumbai has a density of 335,900/ 2 , while slums in Dhaka, Accra, and Hyderabad show population densities of 205,410/ 2 , 60,780/ 2 , and 55,000/ 2 respectively [10, 11, 12, 13] . Given the scale and density of urban slums, they present a significant concern in the context of infectious disease outbreaks because virus transmission is found to be aided by increased population density which, in slums, is manifested as more frequent person-to-person contact, crowded housing, and unsanitary environments [14, 15] . Emerging evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that socio-economic deprivation and overcrowding are resulting in minority populations, such as Black and Asian communities in the UK and African-Americans in the US, being disproportionately affected [16, 17] .",

Over this time, we study the evolution of cumulative infected cases in both the poor and non-poor categories under three scenarios: (i) nonintervention; (ii) medium intervention; and (iii) drastic intervention. Non-intervention is the scenario where we assume that no measures are taken to combat transmission, and the epidemic infects the population and runs the entire course of dynamics with constant contact rate . Medium intervention refers to some form of social distancing strategies required of the population to reduce contact rates, but given the constraints of the poor in distancing themselves, we see differential contact rates for the poor and non-poor. Essentially, the contact rate of non-poor nodes with both poor and non-poor reduces to (< ). Meanwhile, the contact rate of poor with non-poor also decreases to \u2212 = because the non-poor are still maintaining some social distancing from the poor, but the contact rate of poor nodes with other poor nodes remains the same as before, \u2212 = . Therefore, while effective contact rates of both the non-poor and poor nodes decrease under social distancing, the effect is smaller for the poor nodes vis-\u00e0-vis non-poor nodes. Finally, drastic intervention refers to implementation of strategies such as lockdown where movement is severely restricted and the non-poor are able to completely isolate themselves, meaning that the contact rate of non-poor nodes with both poor and non-poor nodes drops to = 0. Poor nodes see their contact rates with non-poor nodes drop to \u2212 = 0, while the poor to poor contact rates remain at \u2212 = . Again, the effective contact rates for both poor and non-poor nodes drop even below the rates under medium intervention, but poor nodes still have non-zero effective contact rates.

Essentially, this means that there is an exponential increase in infected caseloads, with the potential to significantly impact and even overwhelm the health system. We also explore the difference in proportions of poor and non-poor agents (in terms of their respective populations) that form this caseload, and find that both sections of the population are similarly impacted (Fig 1a) . This is brought into sharper relief when we study the cumulative proportions of poor and non-poor affected over time and find that the temporal progression of the proportions of both populations follow exactly the same trajectory (Fig. 1b) . At the end of the outbreak ~82% of the overall population has been infected, with the exact same proportion We now turn our attention to the medium intervention scenario, where some form of social distancing is in place, resulting however in differential contact rates ( ) for the poor and non-poor populations. In terms of overall trends, we find, as expected, that the peak infection rate (25%) and cumulative population infected (73%) under this scenario are lower than in the non-intervention scenario (36% and 82% respectively, Figs. 2a and 2b ), because at time = 41, the intervention that reduces the effective transmission rate begin to take effect. Based on the mean field description of the model (Eq. 12), the effective transmission rate at = 41 would be ( = 41) = 1.4, as against a value of ( = 41) = 2.0 in the case of non-intervention (Eq. 6). This means that transmission of the disease becomes slower and there is a lower peak at = 48, compared to the later and higher peak at = 51 for the non-intervention case (Fig 2a) , but that now the tail is more spread out. We find that our mean field estimates (Eqs. [12] [13] [14] of the point in time when effective transmission rates for all population categories start declining just below 1 are in broad concurrence with attainment of peak caseloads observed in simulationsthey occur at time period ~50 for overall population (48 in simulations), at ~46 for non-poor (47 in simulations), and at ~53 for poor (49 in simulations) (Fig. 2c) . The mean field also estimates that post the removal of intervention ( + ), the effective transmission rate shows an increase (but is still below 1, Fig. 2c) because contact rates are now back to normal, but given the state of the system in terms of numbers of recovered agents (who are now immune) and the remaining susceptible population, there is no further increase in infections.",

Consequently, we also see that the cumulative population infected in the case of the poor is higher at 76%, as against 69% of non-poor (Fig. 2b) , making clear the unequal impacts of the intervention on different sections of the city's population. We would expect that the inability of the poor population to social distance as effectively as the non-poor would naturally result in higher infection rates for the poor, but now given a specific intervention, we are able to quantify the extent of differential impacts in a society.

Slums reflect increased demographic growth, migration, population densities, and poverty, which are the main processes found to be linked with prevalence of infectious diseases [26] . There is evidence to suggest that slum populations scale super-linearly with city size [27] , meaning that larger cities have more than proportionally larger slums. Given larger slums and high population densities, such settlements in large cities comprise possibly the most at-risk populations to infectious outbreak and our finding that the differential impact between poor and non-poor populations is exacerbated with increasing population provides support to this contention.",

In these circumstances, it is difficult to comprehend how social distancing can be implemented, and one of the critical missing links in preparing the population for social distancing or lockdown is the lack of directions of how this can be managed in slum settlements. This becomes especially critical given our finding that increasing intensity of social distancing results in worsening impacts on the poor. Therefore, in the immediate or near term, health departments in developing countries must prepare specific guidelines for social distancing in high density settlements that are clearly communicated and can be implemented by slum dwellers, so that their exposure risks are minimized. However, the long-term solution to this lies in ensuring that slum settlements, which often house a large proportion of the urban population, are provided with functioning environmental infrastructure for running water and sanitation, waste management, and electricity, in addition to basic health infrastructure such as primary healthcare facilities [29, 30, 31] .
