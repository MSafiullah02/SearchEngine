HRV is the most frequent cause of the common cold, but recent data have shown that HRV infection has pathogenic potential beyond rhinosinusitis. It is now recognized that 50\u201385% of asthma exacerbations are due to HRV infections2,3,4, and wheezing illnesses in infancy caused by HRV are associated with a high risk of developing childhood asthma5. HRV infections of all types are major contributors to morbidity associated with exacerbations of other chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease6,7.",

Bioinformatic comparisons of this new genome and other HRV-C sequences showed unique composition profiles in the putative ICAM-1 and LDLR footprint locales, inconsistent with all known major and minor group virus-receptor interactions. Full-length HRV-C15 RNA synthesized in vitro from a cDNA clone was infectious when transfected into cultured cell lines.

When we compared the ICAM-1 binders among themselves, about 40% of identified footprint positions showed strong (r > 0.6) composition conservation (for example, Thr180 in VP3 of HRV-B14 (14-T-3-180)). Some of these positions were conserved among all HRVs (for example, B14-P-1-155 and A16-G-1-148). In contrast, other sites showed a compositional bias between receptor groups (for example, B14-P-3-178). Figure 4a depicts the most abundant residues at each footprint position when the HRV-A and HRV-B sequences were subdivided by ICAM-1 and LDLR receptor groups and compared to the HRV-C sequences. There was little commonality between HRV-C and either the ICAM-1 or the LDLR contact points. For example, six of seven LDLR footprint positions and 47 of 50 ICAM-1 footprint locations were rejected by both statistical methods as compositional matches to the HRV-C (Supplementary Table 2). Overall, the analysis predicts the HRV-C viruses use a different receptor with a distinct compositional footprint from HRV-A and HRV-B viruses.",

Since 2006, over 60 types of this species have been implicated in both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, particularly in children and in individuals with chronic respiratory diseases31. We employed human organ culture of sinus mucosa to propagate in vitro and study the basic biologic properties of an HRV-C clinical isolate (C15 type). Virus replication was demonstrated by an increase in viral RNA, which localized to focal areas in epithelial cell layers. The high-titer virus obtained after serial passage in sinus organ culture allowed complete genome sequencing and cloning of the full-length cDNA copy of the HRV-C15 genome into a plasmid vector. RNA transcripts synthesized in vitro from this clone were infectious when transfected into cell lines resistant to HRV-C15 infection, providing an efficient system for production of recombinant HRV-C. Our experimental findings and bioinformatic predictions indicate unique HRV-C receptor-binding specificity.",

Moreover, our attempts to adapt high-titer HRV-C15 virus grown in sinus cultures or recombinant virus from transfected cells to a cell line were not successful. HRV-C replication in sinus tissue seems to be limited to the epithelium, and hybridization signals were associated with both nonciliated and ciliated cells. The degree of virus amplification (high or low virus yields) showed considerable variability, which could be related to the condition of the epithelium (all specimens were from individuals with sinusitis), other underlying diagnoses (for example, allergy or asthma) or perhaps the status of local innate immune elements. Furthermore, the expression of HRV-C\u2013specific receptors on epithelial cells may depend on factors found in vivo such as microbial products or interactions with other types of cells (for example, dendritic cells or lymphocytes) present in human airways.",

Sequence comparisons within the mapped receptor footprints show variability and a tendency toward a species-specific compositional bias among ICAM-1 binders32. However, amino acid residues corresponding to the documented ICAM-1 footprint have been shown to clearly classify the two receptor groups33. The LDLR binders are harder to define by sequence. They always have a conserved central lysine (for example, in HRV-A2 VP1 it is Lys224) , but this residue is not unique to LDLR binders, and predictive modeling instead suggests that the overall binding specificity primarily relies on a favorable combination of charge complementarities and hydrophobic interactions34. Comparisons of the group amino acid populations of the all known ICAM-1 or LDLR contact residues using two correlation metrics (Spearman and Pearson) revealed that the majority of footprint locations were rejected by both methods as compositional matches to the HRV-C, suggesting that an alternate receptor is used by these viruses. In agreement with this analysis, very low amounts of HRV-C15 attached to HeLa and PBE cells, and incubation of mucosal organ cultures with blocking antibodies to major and minor HRV receptors showed no effects on HRV-C15 binding.",

HRV-C15 binds to an unknown receptor that is expressed on epithelial cells in differentiated tissues but is either absent or underexpressed in many cell lines and is clearly distinct from receptors used by other HRV species. It is possible that the lack of knowledge about the HRV-C receptor and the virus's biology has impeded the development of effective antivirals for HRV, as previous candidate medications were tested only against HRV-A and HRV-B viruses before moving into clinical trials. Even though not all enterovirus species have VP1 motifs that confer susceptibility to capsid binding agents, our results show that this approach can be used to block HRV-C binding and replication. Thus, these studies provide evidence that there are at least two feasible approaches to the treatment or prevention of HRV infections; refinement of capsid binding agents that target multiple species and development of competitive antagonists for the HRV receptors. The availability of organ culture and reverse genetics system should greatly facilitate further studies on HRV-C biology and its receptor identification.",
