The mechanisms of disease eradication include both the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapy and the donor\u2019s immune system to attack residual cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). In addition to eliminating residual cancer cells, the chemotherapy administered in an allogeneic stem cell transplant is used to also suppress the recipient\u2019s immune system to prevent rejection of the donor cells (graft). Patients typically receive additional immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors (i.e., tacrolimus, sirolimus), mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept\u00ae), and/or other drugs (methotrexate, anti-thymocyte globulin) to both prevent rejection of the graft and protect normal recipient/host cells from being attacked by the graft which is known as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes remain the most common indications for allogeneic HSCT [18]. However, advanced chronic leukemias, lymphomas, and hemoglobinopathies are also treated with this type of transplantation.

In addition to changing the hematopoietic progenitor cells, a change in recipient\u2019s with donor\u2019s immune system occurs. Cellular therapy builds on the foundation of collection and infusion of hematopoietic cells used for anti-cancer therapy. The therapeutic immunologic effect of the graft was first described in the field of allogeneic stem cell transplant in the 1950s as a graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL). The GVLeffect is identified following observations of a decrease in relapse rate in leukemia patients who developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplant and further supported by the increased relapse rate seen after syngeneic transplants and transplants using T-cell-depleted grafts [80]. The GVL effect, caused mostly by donor lymphocytes, prompted to the use of donor lymphocyte infusions as one of the earlier forms of cellular therapy subsequently modified genetically to be antigen specific [i.e., chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T-cells], to target different types of leukemias, lymphoma, and other malignances.",

This process typically takes 2\u20133 months and will occur concomitantly with the primary or salvage therapy for management of the disease.

Myeloablative regimens are defined by their ability to eradicate the recipient\u2019s bone marrow with associated profound cytopenia and lack of autologous hematopoietic recovery. Non-myeloablative (NMA) regimens typically cause minimal cytopenia and relying primarily on a GVL effect for disease eradication. Reduced-intensity protocols are an intermediate intensity group of regimens, a middle of the road between ablative and NMA conditioning [5]. The preferred preparative regimen is dependent upon a combination of disease- and patient-related factors. The conditioning regimen is typically administered between Day \u221210 and Day \u22122 with a day of \u201crest\u201d prior to the stem cell infusion to allow for clearance of the cytotoxic chemotherapy, thereby avoiding potential damage to the infused stem cells.

For allogeneic HSCT, this period may last longer dependent upon whether the patient develops graft-versus-host disease or other transplant-related complications discussed later in this chapter. In both autologous and allogeneic HSCT, the recovery period is associated with approximately 2\u20134 weeks of myelosuppression from the conditioning chemotherapy regimen. It is during this time that the donor cells migrate to the bone marrow and begin to produce new blood cells. Patients may require transfusion of blood products during this time and are at greatest risk for bacterial, fungal, and certain viral infections due to low neutrophil counts and potential mucosal damage from mucositis. The extent of immunosuppression during this time is determined by the intensity of the chemotherapy regimen. Immunosuppression may be more prolonged in allogeneic HSCT due to the use of steroids and other immunosuppressant medications for the treatment of GVHD.

This was characterized by the degree of weight gain and edema necessitating fluid removal with or without organ toxicity. The study proposed the following grading system for fluid overload: grade 1, weight gain <10% from baseline, asymptomatic or mild edema, possibly requiring diuretic therapy or a decrease in intravenous fluid replacement; grade 2, symptomatic fluid retention, with or without weight gain \u226510\u2013<20% from baseline, requiring ongoing diuretic therapy; grade 3, weight gain \u226520% from baseline, not responding to diuretic therapy, with possible renal, pulmonary, or cardiac dysfunction requiring further treatment; and grade 4, progressive dysfunction of more than 1 organ system or requiring intensive care. The study included two cohorts. The first was a study cohort of 145 patients undergoing haploidentical HSCT with melphalan-fludarabine-based conditioning regimens. Fluid overload occurred in 66.2% of this cohort with multivariant analysis showing that grade \u22652 (HR, 13.1; 95% CI, 3.4\u201350; P <0.001) and serum creatinine level >1 mg/dL at transplantation admission (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.1\u201311; P = 0.03) were significantly associated with Day +100 non-relapse mortality.

In the acute setting, GVHD is felt to be primarily a T-cell-driven process that is initiated by tissue damage from the conditioning regimen followed by donor T-cell activation and the associated inflammatory response. Risk factors for acute GVHD include but are not limited to increased donor-recipient HLA disparity/mismatch, increased donor age, multiparity (female donors), use of peripheral blood stem cells, and myeloablative conditioning. Acute GVHD can affect multiple organs with the most common being the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. The skin is the most commonly affected organ in acute GVHD. It typically consists of a maculopapular rash that may be pruritic or even painful. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement is typically categorized as upper or lower and is based upon clinical symptoms that may be supported by a tissue diagnosis or biopsy. Upper GI GVHD typically presents with nausea and anorexia, whereas lower GI tract involvement typically presents as profuse watery diarrhea with abdominal cramping. Liver involvement is less common but typically presents with a cholestatic picture [81].",

Reactivation of viral hepatitis, fatty liver, iron overload, and acute drug toxicity are likely the most common causes of abnormal liver function tests during transplant. But the acute onset of ascites, weight gain, fluid retention, and/or rising bilirubin should prompt the concern for veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). VOD/SOS is thought to be the result of pre-existing damage to hepatic venous endothelial cells leading to a procoagulant state leading to deposition of fibrinogen and factor VIII within the venular walls and liver sinusoids. This leads to progressive venular occlusion followed by deposition of collagen in the sinusoids, sclerosis of venular walls, fibrosis of venular lumens, and occlusion of terminal hepatic venules and intercalated veins [22, 34, 61\u201365, 71]. Pre-existing liver disease combined with exposure to high-dose alkylating agents seems to pose the highest risk for the development of VOD/SOS [45]. Commonly used criteria for the diagnosis of this condition are summarized in Table 4. Doppler ultrasound of the liver and liver biopsy may be necessary to differentiate VOD/SOS from acute GVHD of the liver. One of the most promising therapies for VOD/SOS is defibrotide, which is a polydeoxyribonucleotide adenosine receptor agonist that has been shown to affect endothelial cell function through the release of prostanoids, increase in tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), decrease levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and inhibit leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [30, 81]. Studies of defibrotide have shown complete response rates of 30\u201360%, including the treatment of patients with severe VOD/SOS [11, 13, 16, 17, 56\u201358, 70].",

Diagnosis is suggested by the finding of patchy bilateral ground glass or consolidative opacities on imaging [39]. It is confirmed by bronchoscopy with samples that show progressively hemorrhagic returns on sequential lavages in the same subsegment of the lung. Samples may also show hemosiderin-laden macrophages on cytology [20]. Treatment is mostly supportive care with broad-spectrum antibiotics for cases that are suspected to be secondary to infection and glucocorticoid steroids for the treatment of underlying inflammation (i.e., capillaritis) or potential acute GVHD that is associated with some cases. The use of steroids in non-GVHD cases remains somewhat controversial since there is mixed data regarding their efficacy [9, 55]. There is also growing evidence for the potential use of recombinant factor VII as treatment for DAH [10, 29, 50, 53].",

During the pre-engraftment period, it most commonly associated with the preparative/conditioning regimen. Treatments given during the conditioning regimen associated with hemorrhagic cystitis include high-dose cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, and total body irradiation. However, hemorrhagic cystitis occurring in the post-engraftment period is primarily related to BK polyomavirus infection. This typically occurs within the first 100 days posttransplant and is most likely in alternative donor transplants (e.g., unrelated donors, haploidentical, cord blood transplants) [21, 66]. In haploidentical transplantation, the incidence of grade 2\u20134 hemorrhagic cystitis is approximately 25% [54] and can be associated with obstruction and renal insufficiency [33, 38, 48]. The use of alemtuzumab as part of the conditioning regimen has also been associated with increased risk for BK virus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis [49]. Reactivation of BK virus has also been associated with delayed immunologic reconstitution [1]. Treatment includes predominantly drugs or cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes (CTLs). Cidofovir is the predominant pharmacologic agent used to treat BK virus infections with an estimated overall response rate of 79% that includes about 66% of complete responses [12]. For those patients who fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy or have contraindications to such therapy, the use of CTLs is a potential option [6, 78]. Occasionally patients will require percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement for management of ureteral stenosis or obstruction.",

However, patients may experience long-term quality of life and psychosocial issues including concerns over sexuality, fertility, financial toxicity, and integration back to society [41]. Patients also remain at risk for infection with encapsulated organisms and varicella-zoster virus while awaiting complete immune reconstitution, which may take up to 2 years in allogeneic HSCT patients [41, 75].

While myeloid malignancies (i.e., secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia) are most common after autologous HSCT, there is a reported incidence of solid cancers in up to 15% of patients who are recipients of autologous or allogeneic HSCT. This incidence does not seem to have a plateau and is responsible for up to 5\u201310% of late deaths after HSCT. Risk factors include advanced age, the use of total body irradiation, and the development of chronic GVHD. Total body irradiation seems to have a strong association with the development of adenocarcinomas, whereas chronic GVHD seems to be associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Another unique malignancy that can be seen in EBV seropositive patients after allogeneic HSCT with T-cell-depleted grafts or intensive immunosuppression is posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) [19].",

Chronic GVHD and its treatment is a severely immunosuppressive condition which could be associated with various infectious complications related to T-cell dysfunction, like fungal or viral infections, which occasionally may need ICU care. Unlike acute GVHD, chronic GVHD tends to have a gradual onset with symptoms starting after 6 months after transplant and may evolve to organ fibrosis with involvement primarily of the skin/fascia. Classic cases of chronic GVHD tend to occur after Day 100 of transplant, but some patients can develop symptoms earlier as a progressive evolution from acute GVHD. This is known as an overlap syndrome whereby patients exhibit signs and symptoms of both acute and chronic GVHD. Approximately 70\u201380% of cases of chronic GVHD are preceded by acute GVHD with increased risk in patients receiving peripheral blood stem cells from unrelated donors. Treatment includes systemic therapy aimed at controlling the underlying destructive immunologic process (steroids, ruxolitinib, photopheresis) while also providing aggressive supportive care to address symptoms of pain, joint/fascia tightness, chronic dry mouth, and dry eyes. Patients also require ongoing surveillance for skin cancers. This is best accomplished in experienced transplant centers with a multidisciplinary team that includes a transplant physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, dermatologist, and ophthalmologist as available resources [81].",

The most commonly reported reasons for ICU admission are respiratory failure, sepsis, and infection. Although, ICU admission of a stem cell transplant patient, especially with an allogeneic graft, has been associated with a poor prognosis, overall, the survival of HSCT patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission has improved over the years. In fact, a single institution study of patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the ICU showed no difference in survival between those patients who received a transplant and patients who did not receive a transplant [23]. Furthermore, a single center retrospective study of 164 allogeneic HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU showed a long-term survival rate of 61% and 51% at 1 year and 5 years, respectively. This was similar to patients who never required intensive care [76]. van Vliet et al. [79] also showed that admission to the ICU had no negative impact on long-term health-related quality of life for patients being treated for a hematologic malignancy. Forty-five percent (45%) of the patients in the study were recipients of HSCT. However, one of the ongoing struggles with HSCT patients in the ICU is the ability to predict prognosis and the optimal timing for end-of-life discussions with the patients and caregivers.",

This seems to be particularly an issue for those patients who undergo allogeneic HSCT with curative intent where studies of traditional organ function indexes (i.e., APACHE II, APACHE III, and SOFA) seem to provide conflicting results for the ability to predict ICU outcomes in the HSCT population. Afessa et al. [2] found the APACHE III score to have a moderate discrimination and good calibration in predicting hospital mortality, while the APACHE II score had no prognostic value. Gilli et al. [26] concluded that the APACHE II score underestimated mortality, while the use of the SOFA score correlated with hospital mortality. Specifically, there were no patients with a SOFA score >11 who survived in this study. Two other studies also showed a correlation of higher SOFA score with increased hospital mortality [47, 77]. Other studies also suggest that the need for mechanical ventilation is associated with shorter survival [2, 52, 68]. Furthermore, the combination of liver failure and renal failure in mechanically ventilated HSCT patients seems to be universally fatal [4, 25, 60].",

This group concluded that the patients least likely to have planned for poor outcomes are the most likely to face them and engaging in ACP is not inconsistent with hoping for the best outcome in HSCT [24, 40].",

Complications are primarily related to infections or organ failure from chemotherapy. Even though concerns remain with the need for ICU care in allogeneic hematopoietic transplant recipients, several studies have shown encouraging results, likely related to an overall lower intensity of conditioning regimens, better prevention of infectious complications, expanded availability of treatment options, and better recognition of potential complications that can occur in these patients.",
