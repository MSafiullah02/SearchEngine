It has placed societal and financial burden on the globe. Its rapid progressions from mild URI symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a matter of days is the underlying reason as to why the world is struggling to keep up with ventilator production. In this case report, we went about proning a corona virus positive patient for 6-8hrs as a potential early intervention to prevent progression to ARDS. Our patient was initially in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and placed on nasal cannula. He was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with no improvement of symptoms. However within the span of few hours of proning he experienced significant symptomatic relief with improvement of oxygenation. His oxygen saturation improved drastically and eventually was taken off of nasal cannula and discharged within span of one day of proning.",

Patients can progress from asymptomatic or mild illness to hypoxemic respiratory failure or multisystem organ failure, necessitating intubation and intensive care management. [7] Prone positioning is a technique well established in the management of intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). [2] Studies have shown that the physiological changes associated with the prone position in nonintubated patients may be even more favorable than in intubated patients and that prone position may prove beneficial in some cases of hypoxemic respiratory failure, even in awake patients, by avoiding mechanical ventilation and ventilator-associated complications.

            "text": "Prone positioning causes improved oxygenation by alteration in the mechanics and physiology of gas change. Improvement in gas exchange by prone positioning occurs by enhancement of ventral-dorsal transpulmonary difference, reducing dorsal lung compression and better lung perfusion. Prone positioning causes the intra-pleural pressure to become less negative in non-dependent and less positive in dependent portion of lung due to thoracic-lung shape modification which in turn causes reduced dorsal lung compression by increase of regional inflation distribution in dorsal region and decrease in ventral regions [1, 2] . In acute lung injury, since blood flow and alveolar collapse are both greatest in the dependent portion of lungs, there is a significant ventilation perfusion mismatch in supine position, however in prone position the previously dependent lung continues to receive the majority of the blood flow (independent of the gravitational gradient) as alveoli reopen, while the newly dependent lung continues to receive the minority of the blood flow as alveoli begin to collapse [3] . Of note, although in healthy lungs pulmonary perfusion is greatest along dependent portion of lungs, studies have shown that in diseased lungs, blood is diverted towards non-dependent positions through various mechanisms including hypoxic vasoconstriction, vessel obliteration and external vessel compression [4] .",

Significant improvement in patient's oxygen saturation was noted after the patient was prone for at least 6-8 hours. Several studies have shown that in most patients with ARDS (up to 70%), prone ventilation increases PaO 2 allowing a reduction in the FiO2. Mure, M et al. reported a study showing the positive effect of prone positioning on oxygenation in patients with acute lung insufficiency. 12 out of 13 patient responded to treatment in prone positioning showing dramatic increase in oxygenation index and decrease in A-a gradient [5] . Although our patient did not meet the criteria for ARDS, his oxygen saturation improved clinically status post lying in prone position. This could've possibly been secondary to effects of hydroxychloroquine as well however it was stopped prior to proning without significant improvement in oxygenation. C. Valter et al. reported a case showing improvement of PaO2 in non-intubated hypoxemic respiratory failure with prone positioning [6] . To date very few studies have been published showing benefit of prone positioning in non-ARDS patients receiving non-invasive ventilation.",
