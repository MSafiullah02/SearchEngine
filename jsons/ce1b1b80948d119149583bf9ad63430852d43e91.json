Queries are question postings held out from the test collection, each containing both text and at least one formula. We expect this to be a challenging task, as both math and text may be needed to find relevant answer posts. While several models have been proposed for text question answering, math question answering is in an earlier stage of development. To advance math-aware search and mathematical question answering systems, we will create a standard test collection for researchers to use for benchmarking. ARQMath will also include a formula retrieval sub-task: individual formulas from question posts are used to locate formulas in earlier answer posts, with relevance determined by narrative fields created based on the original question. We will use these narrative fields to explore diverse information needs for formula search (e.g., alternative notation, applications in specific fields or definition).",

Techniques for answering one specific type of mathematical question, automated theorem proving, date back to 1956 when Newell and Simon [9] introduced the logic theorist that proved theorems in symbolic logic. Three years later, they introduced the General Problem Solver [10] , which attempted to mimic students' behavior in discovering proofs. For math QA, an important recent development was the work of Ling et al. [6] , who solved algebraic word problems by generating answer rationales and human-readable mathematical expressions that derive a final answer along with a description of the method used to solve the problem. Kushman et al.

The NTCIR Mathematical Information Retrieval (MathIR) tasks developed evaluation methods and allowed participating teams to establish baselines for both \"text + math\" queries and isolated formula retrieval. NTCIR-12 ultimately made use of two collections, one a set of arXiv papers from physics that is split into paragraph-sized documents, and the other a set of articles from English Wikipedia. Interest in these tasks is global; at the NTCIR-12 MathIR task, for example, there were participating groups from around the world, including Europe (Czech Republic, Germany), Asia (China, India, Japan) and North America (Canada, USA). The NTCIR-12 isolated formula retrieval test collection was also later used by participants for the 2016 Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (CROHME) [8] at the International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR).",

We envision two improvements over what was done at NTCIR: further developing the concept of \"formula relevance\" and creating a collection with a larger number of formula queries (NTCIR-12 has only 20 formula queries + 20 modified versions of the same formulas with wildcards added). Each formula query will be a single formula extracted from a question used in the main task. For each query, annotators will write a short human-readable narrative field -not available to participating systems -that reflects their understanding of the type(s) of similarity the person who asked the original question would have found useful. This may include alternative notation, simplification, specialization, or applications in specific fields, and we expect to extend those categories further based on suggestions from participating teams. Because participating systems won't have access to this narrative field in for their \"standard condition\" run, we expect this task to support research on diversity ranking for formula retrieval.

Each question will include a unique ID, the asker-entered title for their question, the askerentered body of the question, three formats for formulas found in the body of the question (L A T E X, Presentation MathML, and Content Math ML; see below), a list containing any edits to the question that were subsequently done by the asker, one or more asker-entered type tags (e.g., \"calculus\"), and comments on the question entered by other users, the average score assigned by other MSE users to the question (which one might interpret as a measure of how \"good\" a question it is), and the asker's reputation score (which is estimated from scores given to their prior questions). Only the first four of these (ID, title, body, formulas) will be used for the standard condition, but the additional features will be available for use in contrastive runs.",

We will perform this extraction centrally and distribute the extracted formulas as standoff annotations with references to the location of the formula in each XML question or answer post. Converting LaTeX to Presentation MathML is a straightforward transformation between formula appearance representations (i.e., symbols on writing lines). Producing Content MathML from LaTeX requires inference, and is thus potentially errorful. However, Content MathML supports a higher level of abstraction by representing operator structure explicitly. Centralizing this conversion will remove one possible source of variation, but conversion scripts will also be made available to participants who wish to experiment with extended conversion capabilities.

Assessors for the formula retrieval task will work with merged pools from both the formula retrieval task and (where appropriate for the question) from the main task to identify similar formulas. Most pools will be judged by a single assessor, but some will be dual-assessed to observe annotator agreement. For the formula retrieval task, queries will be selected for dual annotation using stratified random sampling so as to cover a broad range of similarity types. We also plan for some limited experimentation with alternative annotation strategies (e.g., additionally annotating the most useful parts of a relevant answer, or annotating the preference order between relevant answers) with the goal of informing evaluation design in future years.",

We have chosen to focus on CQA, using Math Stack Exchange, both because that task models an actual employment scenario, and because the scale of the available collection is sufficient to also support the development of a second test collection more narrowly focused on formula retrieval. Math is, of course, only one example of structured notation, and we might reasonably hope to one day leverage similar ideas in other domains that also frequently use specialized notation, such as biology or chemistry.",
