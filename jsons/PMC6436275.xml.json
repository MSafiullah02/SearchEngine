Implementation of such programs mandates a thoughtful appreciation of their importance to the Saudi Arabian healthcare system, first, and then it requires an orchestrated coordination between all the healthcare stakeholders to achieve the goal, second. To that end, as a beginning step, I recommend formulation of a nominated task force headed by Ministry of Education (MOE) and co-headed by Alfaisal University College of Medicine (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). The task force members will consist of the following: the MOH, leaderships of individual medical colleges, Saudi Deans Committee (SDC), Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCHS), public health professionals, public and private healthcare firms as well as expert members of international advisory health/education organizations.",

Gladly, this step is already in place in almost all medical schools; however, the adequacy of the public health content should be revisited. Importantly, the public health concentration areas should be specifically tailored toward the ones that meet the country-specific healthcare challenges and priorities, such as mass gathering (Hajj \u2013 annual Islamic pilgrimage), infectious disease (communicable/noncommunicable diseases and Middle East corona virus), maternal and child health, health policy, and others \u2013 as seen appropriately by the MOH. The practicum experience should take place during the clerkship years, through organized activities during family medicine/preventive medicine clinical rotations, internship electives, or summer breaks. The research thesis should be completed before the end of the dual-degree program; summer breaks should be utilized effectively, or possibly protected time slots should be offered during the clerkship years. The thesis should reflect culmination of the entire MPH educational experience, that is, applying the knowledge gained from course work and practicum experience into a scholarly communication (maybe a peer-reviewed manuscript). By the end of training, MBBS-MPH graduates will be uniquely positioned to undertake jobs in academic medicine, clinical research, community medicine, rural medicine, global health, and healthcare policy.",

Taken this philosophy into account, a plausible question pops up into mind: do the current medical MBBS curricula provide \u201cadequate\u201d education in public health?
