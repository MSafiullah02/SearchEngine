Johnstone et al.7 found that patients with viral pneumonia had more cardiac comorbidities and were older; Ma et al.8 found that institutionalization led to a greater risk of viral CAP. Liu et al.9 reported that viral pneumonia caused more cough and less pleuritic pain, while Jennings et al.10 found myalgia to be the symptom most commonly associated with the viral disease.

The most widely accepted hypothesis is that the viral infection occurs first, followed by the bacterial form. Viral-mediated activation of proinflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-10, is thought to attract large numbers of neutrophils and macrophages to the lung. The arrival of these cytokines amplifies the immune response, causing inflammatory damage and preventing the proper clearance of bacteria.40 Bacterial superinfection worsens the prognosis of the original viral infection. Indeed, research into the influenza pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968 shows that most deaths were caused by a secondary bacterial infection.41 During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 4%\u201324% of cases presented secondary bacterial infection.42, 43, 44 In infections caused by other viruses, however, especially H5N1 avian influenza, the associated pneumonia appears to be caused (more frequently) by direct viral action.45\n",

The cytidine analog, cidofovir, originally developed as treatment for CMV, has shown success in vitro against adenoviruses, although the response in immunocompromised patients with several forms of severe pneumonia was poor.101 Intravenous ribavirin has been used with success in lung transplant recipients with respiratory infections caused by metapneumovirus.102 Pleconaril, which incorporates itself into the capsid of Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, has been successfully used in limited case series; it is not yet on the market and is limited to compassionate use.103 There is little doubt that intravenous acyclovir is beneficial in the rare cases of varicella zoster pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.85, 104 Lastly, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids can improve the clinical course of viral CAP,85 although this application is still controversial.",
