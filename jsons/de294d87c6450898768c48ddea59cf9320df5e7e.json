In an effort to survey for the presence of other infectious agents, known and unknown, we screened sera from 16 Pteropus giganteus bats from Faridpur, Bangladesh, using high-throughput pyrosequencing. Sequence analyses indicated the presence of a previously undescribed virus that has approximately 50% identity at the amino acid level to GB virus A and C (GBV-A and -C). Viral nucleic acid was present in 5 of 98 sera (5%) from a single colony of free-ranging bats. Infection was not associated with evidence of hepatitis or hepatic dysfunction. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this first GBV-like flavivirus reported in bats constitutes a distinct species within the Flaviviridae family and is ancestral to the GBV-A and -C virus clades.",

Bangladesh is a 'hotspot' for emerging zoonotic diseases [9] , with a relatively high diversity of wildlife that likely harbors new zoonotic pathogens, one of the densest human populations on the planet, and a high level of connectivity between people, domestic animals and wildlife. In Bangladesh and India, frugivorous Pteropus giganteus bats have been identified as a reservoir for NiV [10, 11] , which has been recognized as the cause of several outbreaks of encephalitis [12] [13] [14] . Pteropus giganteus bats are common throughout the Indian subcontinent, living in close association with humans and feeding on cultivated fruit [14] . NiV transmission from bats to humans has been linked with the harvest and consumption of raw date palm sap, which becomes contaminated with bat feces, urine or saliva overnight when bats such as P. giganteus come to feed from the collecting pots [14, 15] . Date palm sap or other foods eaten by both bats and people, may also serve as a vehicle for transmission of other bat-borne agents.",

Each bat was anesthetized using isoflurane gas; morphometric measurements (weight, forearm length, head length, and body condition) were taken and bats were aged [10] . Each bat was marked for future identification using an RFID microchip (AVID corp, www.avidid. com) implanted subcutaneously between the scapulae. Three mL of blood were collected and placed into serum separator tubes (vacutainer; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Serum was allowed to separate overnight at 4uC then drawn off without centrifugation and immediately frozen using a liquid nitrogen dry shipper. To inactivate potentially infectious agents, serum samples were heat-treated at 56uC for 30 min and then stored at 270uC. For RNA extraction, 250 mL of serum was added to 750 mL Tri-Reagent LS (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA). Saliva was collected from the bat's throat using a sterile cotton swab. Urine was collected either by catching urine in a 1.0 mL sterile cryovial while the bat was urinating, or by urethral swab. Urine and saliva swabs were immediately placed into 1 mL Tri-Reagent LS and frozen in liquid nitrogen.",

Opportunities for transmission to humans are particularly prominent in countries like Bangladesh, where people live in close association with bats. Whereas previous studies of bats have employed assays that test for known pathogens, we present the first application of an unbiased molecular approach to pathogen discovery in this reservoir for emerging zoonotic disease. Unbiased pyrosequencing of serum from Pteropus giganteus bats enabled identification of a novel flavivirus related to Hepatitis C and GB viruses. Viral nucleic acid was present in 5 of 98 (5%) sera, and in the saliva of one animal. Sequence identification of two strains of the virus, tentatively named GBV-D, suggests P. giganteus as a natural reservoir. Detection of viral nucleic acid in saliva provides a plausible route for zoonotic transmission. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that GBV-D is ancestral to GBV-A and -C, and separate from the recently classified genus Hepacivirus. Our findings provide new insight into the range of known hosts for GB-like viruses and demonstrate the power of unbiased sequencing to characterize the diversity of potentially zoonotic pathogens carried by bats and other reservoirs.",

Extracts of 16 individual bats were combined into 4 pools consisting of 4 pregnant adult bats, 4 non-pregnant adult female bats, or 264 adult male bats. Each pool yielded between 1,400 and 2,000 assembled contigs or singlton reads (representing 50,000-75,000 reads ranging in size from 31-328 nt). Two reads of 238 and 215 nucleotides (nt) derived from the pregnant bat pool had distant homology to GBV-A sequences at the deduced amino acid (aa) level in the E2 and NS4A gene regions respectively (BLASTX); no homology was detected by searches at the nt level (BLASTN; local copy of the executables with standard settings except that the reward for a nucleotide match was set to 2 instead of 1). No viral sequences were detected in other pools at the nt or aa levels. Screening of the individual RNA preparations from the pregnant bat pool using primers derived from the UHTS reads confirmed the presence of the GBV-like sequence in the serum of bat 93. A quantitative real time PCR assay indicated a load of approximately 30 000 RNA copies in bat-93 serum extract, and identified an additional 4 positive bat sera from the original 98 samples (5/98; 5%), indicating serum loads ranging from 350 to 70,000 RNA copies per assay. These positive samples came from male bats that were not included in the initial UHTS pools.

In GBV-D the first potential signal sequence cleavage site is present after a stretch of 57, largely basic aa (6 kDa, pI = 12), followed by sequence homologous to E1 (pfam 01539, http:// pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) ( Figure 3 ). The single glycosylation site N 177 IT present in that sequence is located in a position comparable to GBV-C, -A, -B and HCV glycosylation sites. Identification of the downstream E2 termini is less apparent as the next 580 aa contain multiple potential signal sequences and 10 potential glycosylation sites that indicate no homology to hepaciviral E2/NS1 (pfam 01560), until the sequence aligns with N-terminal NS2 motifs (pfam 01538) (Figure 2, Figure 3 ). However, despite similarity to pfam 01538 no signal sequence compatible with cleavage at A 759 /A was found; cleavage may occur at G 826 /R, which combined with potential signalase cleavage at A 584 /F may indicate the existence of a heavily glycosylated potential 26 kDa product instead of the p7 transmembrane protein identified in HCV [37] [38] [39] or the 13 kDa variant described in GBV-B [40, 41] . Conserved C-terminal motifs of the autocatalytic NS2/NS3 endoprotease domain are compatible with NS2/NS3 cleavage at S 1067 /A and comparable to other GBV and HCV [42] .

The modest yield of novel microbial sequences may reflect the choice of sample (e.g., serum vs feces, tissue or another specimen), competition between host and microbial template during unbiased amplification, or both. Efforts to address template competition are under way that include subtraction of host nucleic acids or the use of semi-random primers that do not amplify host sequences. Such efforts will likely enhance the sensitivity and throughput of unbiased sequencing technologies for pathogen discovery. The discovery of this chiropteran flavivirus broadens both the taxonomical and geographical distribution of GB-like viruses. Three types of GB viruses have been described: GBV-A, -B and -C [18, 19, 24, 25, 54, 57] . GBV-B, which has never been found in humans and was only reported in captive tamarins after serial passage of the original human GB serum [58] , is most closely related to HCV and was recently classified together with HCV into a new genus, Hepacivirus, within the family Flaviviridae [16] . GBV-A and -C remain unclassified members of the family. GBV-A have been isolated from several New World monkeys. Different genotypes appear to be associated with specific monkey species of the genera Saguinus, Callithrix (Callitrichidae family) and Aotus (Aotidae family), without any clinical signs associated with infection [24, 54, 57] . GBV-C have been isolated from humans with non-A-E hepatitis; however, its pathogenicity is unknown and the virus is widespread in the human population [21, [59] [60] [61] . Population studies showed that GB viruses are enzoonotic and species-specific within both Old and New World nonhuman primates as well as humans, and have likely co-evolved with their hosts over long periods of time [62] . Previously, the only GBV found in the Old world was GBV-C from chimpanzees (in Africa) and humans. Although GBV-C were found in humans, GB viruses have not been previously reported in primates or other animals on the Indian subcontinent.",

Due to exhaustion of our samples we were unable to complete assessment of the 59-terminal sequence; nonetheless, RACE experiments suggest that GBV-D likely codes for a short basic peptide, instead of a full-length C protein. The first methionine (M 1 ) predicts a peptide of 57 aa (pI = 12); however, the more favorable Kozak context [63] of M 3 indicates a 55 aa peptide. After signalase cleavage from the polyprotein precursor, this peptide may be functional, possibly influencing maturation of, or directly binding to, the E1 and/or E2 glycoproteins.",

Mixed relationships indicative of recombination events [64] were not evident (Figure 2, Figure 4 ). Both pteropid bats and chimpanzees are restricted to the Old World. While the range of chimpanzees (Africa) and P. giganteus (the Indian subcontinent) do not overlap, it is possible that other primate species in Bangladesh or India, such as macaques, or other fruit bats in Africa such as Eidelon spp., whose range overlaps that of chimpanzees, may carry related viruses. While GBV-A is only known from primates of the New World, an African origin has been suggested for GBV-C based on a 12-aa indel sequence in NS5A [65] . Although the NS5A sequence of GBV-D, similar to that of GBV-A, appears elongated in the indel region, compatible with their respective earlier phylogenetic branching compared to GBV-C, little sequence conservation is observed in that region.",

The lack of chemical evidence of hepatic inflammation or dysfunction suggests that this virus may not target hepatic cells in bats. This is consistent with the behavior of GBV-A in its natural primate hosts [54] . In contrast, elevated alanine transferase levels and mild hepatitis are observed in experimental infections of macaques with GBV-C isolates from humans [67] . Five percent of the bats we studied were infected with one of at least two different strains of GBV-D, which suggests widespread viral circulation within this species. The observation that bats are asymptomatically infected with diverse strains that constitute a distinct phylogenetic clade is compatible with a co-evolutionary relationship between GBV and their hosts [57, 62] , and supports the hypothesis that P. giganteus bats may be a natural reservoir for GBV-D. In one case we were able to detect GBV-D nucleic acid in saliva. This suggests a potential route for viral transmission via fighting or grooming behavior, or via food shared by bats.",

Human consumption of contaminated palm juice is proposed to be a major route of NiV transmission [68] .
