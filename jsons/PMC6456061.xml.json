            "text": "Schools likely exhibit varying academic recovery trajectories after disasters. When we refer to academic recovery trajectories, we mean the outcomes for schools with regard to their academic outcomes over time. A central tenet of disaster research is that disasters do not affect all people or communities equally (Esnard & Sapat, 2014; Fothergill & Peek, 2015; Peacock, Van Zandt, Henry, Grover, & Highfield, 2012; Thomas, Phillips, Lovekamp, & Fothergill, 2013). In addition, practical lay evidence points to the fact that schools likely exhibit heterogeneous academic responses to disasters (Layton, 2014; Texas Engineering Extension Service, 2011). This is supported by the fact that schools\u2019 non\u2010academic responses, such as timeframe in which they are able to reopen after disasters differ (Esnard, Lai, Wyczalkowski, Malmin, & Shah, 2018). For example, after Hurricane Matthew\u2010related floods in North Carolina in 2016, Princeville Elementary School was closed for 13 days, while West Lumberton Elementary School remained closed for a full year (Harper, 2017).",

            "text": "An examination of school academic recovery trajectories must incorporate underlying risk factors, including: school attendance rate, minority percentage, percentage of economically disadvantaged students, student\u2010teacher ratio, and average years of teacher experience. As noted by Peek, Abramson, Cox, Fothergill, and Tobin (2018), there is a need for child disaster research that focuses on intersectional research (p. 250). Related indicators and data associated with student achievement are regularly collected by school districts, and thus may readily be examined in future studies of school academic recovery. To illustrate, students who miss class time at higher rates than their peers are more susceptible to falling behind academically, particularly low\u2010income students (Chang & Romero, 2008; Morrissey, Hutchison, & Winsler, 2014; Romero & Lee, 2007). Although the racial performance gap is closing, minority students still often underperform compared to their white counterparts (National Education Association [NEA], 2013). In addition, economically disadvantaged students may lack parental and financial support to maintain success in school (Cooper, 2010; Cooper & Crosnoe, 2007; Crosnoe & Cooper, 2010), and still lag behind their higher income peers in school performance (NEA, 2013). Regarding student\u2010teacher ratios and teacher experience, educational outcomes are higher for students in smaller classrooms (Cho, Gewwe, & Whitler, 2012; Rodriguez & Elbaum, 2014; Whitehurst & Chingos, 2011) with teachers who have more classroom and subject matter experience (Antoniou, 2013; Liu, Lee, & Linn, 2010; Mackenzie, Hemmings, & Kay, 2011).",

Initial evidence indicates that schools exhibit multiple patterns of responses to disasters. Although this evidence relies on non\u2010scientific sources (e.g., newspaper reporting, anecdotal information, real estate, economic outcome reports), some schools in the path of Hurricane Ike exhibited no marked change in their student enrollment after the hurricane (Texas Education Agency [TEA], 2009). Yet in Galveston, Texas, where Hurricane Ike made landfall, student enrollment fell by 20 percent immediately after the hurricane, largely due to families evacuating the region. This led to unintended consequences of lower school operating budgets and teacher layoffs (Texas Engineering Extension Service, 2011), which further decimated schools\u2019 institutional infrastructures.",

For example, the Baggerly and Ferretti (2008) study of public schools in Florida after the 2004 hurricane season focused on one average impact of disasters on school functioning (i.e., they assumed all schools followed one pattern of recovery). However, Baggerly and Ferretti (2008) conducted a thorough literature review, which provides initial evidence for multiple patterns of school recovery. They reported that some schools (exact numbers not included) in areas with high hurricane impact reported higher scores post\u2010hurricanes. Using a more in\u2010depth presentation of information gleaned from newspapers, they noted that Peace River Elementary School reported that 56 percent of third grade students read at grade level before Hurricane Charley, while 80 percent were reading at grade level one year after. While unexpected, the authors suggested that this could have occurred because schools provided a \u201crefuge\u201d from the chaos, and students may have studied more in order to avoid thinking about hurricane damage. Alternative explanations were that students with lower test scores may have left the district or dropped out of school; however, a comparison of student performance for those who left versus those who stayed found no pre\u2010disaster achievement differences between these two groups.",

            "text": "Advanced statistical techniques, namely growth mixture modeling, can be leveraged to empirically identify latent school academic recovery trajectories. In this paper we used growth mixture modeling to empirically identify underlying (latent) patterns of school recovery. Growth mixture modeling is a data informed approach that identifies latent heterogeneous populations within data post\u2010hoc (Ram & Grimm, 2009). In growth mixture modeling, expectation maximization procedures are used to identify recovery patterns in the data. Growth mixture modeling identifies groups of schools that are similar in their underlying (latent) recovery patterns and different from other groups of schools in their recovery patterns (i.e., growth mixture modeling allows for an examination of inter\u2010school differences in intra\u2010school change over time). This distinguishes growth mixture modeling from variable centered approaches, which focus on relationships between variables instead of groups. Models with differing numbers of patterns (e.g., models with one, two, three recovery patterns) are examined. These models may be compared and empirically tested to identify and examine diverse patterns of school recovery. This approach allowed us to characterize school recovery trajectories (i.e., number of trajectories and their parameters) and identify proportions of schools falling in these trajectories.",

            "text": "To identify school academic recovery trajectories, we used growth mixture modeling, using Mplus4 (Version 7.4). Our justification for this approach is that growth mixture modeling, specifically, latent class growth analysis (LCGA), allowed us to identify latent recovery trajectories in the data. LCGA is a subset of growth mixture modeling (Jung & Wickrama, 2008). Separate growth models for latent school academic recovery trajectories of individual school recovery were modeled. The school academic recovery trajectories were categorical latent variables, and each recovery pattern had unique estimates of variances and the influence of covariates. Growth was modeled piecewise, allowing for a different slope to be estimated for the time\u2010period from 2005 to 2008 (pre\u2010hurricane) and 2009\u20132011 (post\u2010hurricane). Expectation maximization procedures were used to maximize intra\u2010pattern homogeneity and inter\u2010pattern heterogeneity for separate models of increasing numbers of trajectories (e.g., a one academic recovery trajectory model, a two\u2010trajectory model, etc.). Determination of the number of academic recovery trajectories was guided by parsimony and fit indices (e.g., Bayesian Information Criteria, Lo Mendell Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test, bootstrap likelihood ratio tests). The three\u2010step approach was used to predict trajectory membership (Asparouhov & M\u00fathen, 2013; Vermunt, 2010), which accounts for uncertainty related to trajectory membership.",

This paper examined potential trajectories of school academic recovery among schools affected by Hurricane Ike.

School attendance was protective, in that schools with higher rates of school attendance were more likely to exhibit a High\u2010Stable versus a Low\u2010Interrupted trajectory. School attendance has been found in other studies as an important contributor to school performance (Chang & Romero, 2008; Morrissey et al., 2014), and the findings here support this hypothesis. In contrast, economic disadvantage was a risk factor, in that schools with higher rates of economically disadvantaged students were more likely to fall in the Low\u2010Interrupted versus High\u2010Stable trajectories. Generally, economically disadvantaged communities are more likely to have lower functioning schools (NEA, 2013), a finding supported by the data here. This finding points to the broader pattern of isolation of low socioeconomic groups in areas with less access to schools, as well as other services including transit, jobs, and healthcare.",

School population is largely reflective of local neighborhood population; therefore, school population characteristics are expected to change as the surrounding neighborhoods undergo socioeconomic transformation. Smith (2006) made the connection between social vulnerability and disaster effects. He suggested that \u201cthere is no such thing as a natural disaster\u201d because pre\u2010existing vulnerabilities interact with natural phenomena to produce the disaster effects. Others have also found support for this idea. For example, the \u201cgrowth recovery machine\u201d thesis suggests differential recovery of neighborhoods based on their pre\u2010disaster socioeconomic status (SES) (Pais & Elliott, 2008); high SES neighborhoods are more resilient, given access to more resources available to recover, than low SES neighborhoods, leading to a relatively more robust recovery in higher SES neighborhoods. Less advantageous location and poor building quality are inextricably tied to lower SES neighborhoods, where recovery is slower (Bolin & Stanford, 1998; Peacock, Van Zandt, Zhang, & Highfield, 2014; Stough, 2010; Weber & Lichtenstein, 2015), as evidenced by Hurricane Ike, which was reported to have created more damage in low\u2010value than high\u2010value homes in Galveston, Texas (Peacock et al., 2014; Van Zandt & Sloan, 2017).",

Significant heterogeneity on important characteristics may exist within this group. We acknowledge that our analysis was limited to overall academic performance in schools, as measured across subjects. Future research that can examine academic performance by subject areas (e.g., Mathematics, Science, English) is needed. In addition, our study focused on schools as a critical institution post\u2010disaster. Although important, future research should integrate student, school, and district level information to shed light on how different levels of the overall school environment interact. Further, this study sample included a broad and diverse range of schools, which is an important contribution to the literature. However, the sample was limited to schools in Texas. Findings need to be tested for replication across other locations and after other disasters. Finally, our examination of race and ethnicity was limited in this paper to an examination of percentage of minority students within schools. Future work is needed to address this complex social vulnerability, and special attention should be paid to heterogeneity within racial/ethnic groups. Along the same lines, intersectional research is needed that examines interactions between these characteristics and others that influence student experiences of disasters.",

The richness and nuance of information obtained from this analysis yielded trajectories that will be important in preparing schools to mitigate the risks of disasters, and to quickly identify and assist schools that are at risk for slow recovery after disasters. Overall the evidence points to the need for additional policy focusing on low SES groups, which suffer hardships both in housing recovery and educational outcomes after disaster. Absenteeism, which has been found to be an important factor in student performance, can be exacerbated by slow economic recovery in low SES areas. Therefore, public policy should reflect these needs and assign additional resources to low SES areas after disaster. The long\u2010term goal of this research is to develop a novel approach to depict profiles of modifiable and immutable factors that identify schools at highest risk for academic decline after disasters.",

Research is needed on what characterizes schools that are able to recover quickly, or even thrive, post\u2010disaster. This information is increasingly important in areas vulnerable to extreme events, and can position stakeholders (e.g., school administrators, teachers, policy makers) to better understand the potential trajectory of schools, particularly in counties with physical vulnerability risks. Pre\u2010disaster preparedness, response planning, and policy initiatives can in turn be customized to minimize effects of natural disasters on school academic functioning. Further, the methodology developed here may be generalized for use after other disasters in other states (as well as other disasters in Texas). Thus, this work has the potential to transform future studies of disaster impacts on school functioning and improve cross\u2010study and cross\u2010model examinations of disaster impacts that inform disaster policy and education policy practitioners. Of note, the TEA has, as a matter of policy, collected information on factors generally associated with academic performance (e.g., teacher credentials, student\u2010teacher ratio, socioeconomic factors). Given that other states collect similar data on their public schools, this methodology may be generalized and applied to examine school recovery after other natural disasters (e.g., schools in New Jersey and New York after Superstorm Sandy).",

Future research can examine how declines in institutional infrastructure may have differential impacts on how schools recover from disasters. One fruitful area of inquiry to explore may be network\u2010focused public management. This issue was raised by Meier and O'Toole (2003).
