            "text": "There is a ghostly feeling when looking outside. It is as if somehow we have become figures inside real-world Edward Hopper paintings. All that leaves the strange feeling behind that something big may be going on. But there is no clear and consistent answer, neither from the experts, nor from political leadership, as to how to address this exceptional situation. Important decisions may become triggered by public opinion, and thus the overall situation may entirely spin out of evidence-based control. It seems that the hour of countless experts, of epidemiologists and lab-scientists has arrived. The hour of those who were hidden behind large screens and next to super-computers for big data management and PCR analysis, in remote corners and basements of our hospitals and faculty buildings, and that these people seem to have been prepared for their moment to arrive. That\u2019s what is happening now: We, who are used to treating patients on an individual basis have become subordinates of crisis units and eminent telegenic virologists. That may the right thing for the time being, if there was coherent advice. But I wish these experts would be more consistent in their analysis of the situation and in their recommendations, because even for us as doctors it is difficult to understand what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. How should we expect the public to understand such a situation and to behave accordingly, if we don\u2019t know ourselves what\u2019s going on based on facts? Having tried to drink a beer with one of my colleagues at the lakeside this week, we were driven away by patrolling police. That made me recall dystopic scenarios from stories and movies of the past, depicting totalitarian States, where entirely new professions were generated, such as Stalkers, who used to guide people and take them around to forbidden zones [3] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB7jVTut3-g).",

There is a significant lack of doctors and of nursing staff, and in terms of access to ICU-beds with ventilators in some countries, whereas in others, the situation seems to be less precarious. For example, how is it that in the UK, home to some of the finest educational and research institutions and to a good proportion of the richest people in the world, only approximately 4000 ICU beds exist - for a population of approximately 66 million people? Other countries on the other hand, were deprived of their medical staff due to more precarious general economic situations, with doctors and nurses following the westward stream toward politically more transparent and wealthier countries. Medical education is expensive, and there is global competition for well-trained and mobile doctors and nurses. Poor political planning and cultural differences from an all-inclusive state responsibility to more social Darwinist principles may be the reason, and reflect the different approaches across European countries. In times of crisis, nobody wants to be left behind however, and that\u2019s why we are hearing so many outcries from various corners for more social fairness at this time.",

That may become redemption day for some, and it may become pay day for others; Beyond the giant socio-economic impact of this crisis, there will be an accounting of medical and surgical collateral damage, which has been caused by the currently imposed restrictions and postponing of otherwise indicated medical and neuro/surgical care. In our field alone thousands of patients, with degenerative spinal disease, low grade gliomas, cavernomas, epilepsy and other pathologies are put on ever-increasing waiting lists. Meanwhile, mild paresis may become moderate, tumors may grow to more complexity, cavernomas may bleed, and repeated seizures may have deleterious consequences. All that will happen, and it will have to be accounted for, when there will come a time to do so, and after the whole mountain of delayed surgeries will be worked up. Truth will come, and it won\u2019t be comfortable for those, who may be riding on high-tide right now.",

            "text": "This unclarity, radiating from the highest levels of political leadership and from contradictory expert panels, this lack of consistent leadership continues to induce a feeling of insecurity among people. Seeing photos of old people, who were overrun by hysterical crowds during the opening of supermarket doors, or of overworked and tired nurses, who find themselves in front of emptied grocery shelves, and of strong men defending the towers of toilet paper, which they had just bought; All these images, that materialized prove that the taint of civilization is so thin that it\u2019s being blown away after only a couple of complicated weeks, appalls me and it renders it difficult not to lose faith in our species. And it confirms my long-standing notion that sometimes the seemingly biggest and strongest among us seem to have the least compassion in those moments, when one should stay calm and cool and caring. Then, I have to focus my mind on the enlightening idea that not all people are like that, that the majority isn\u2019t in fact. And that\u2019s why we have to continue to strive to deliver the best possible service to our patients and to have confidence in our species. But how will things develop if the situation is not resolved in a few weeks\u2019 time? The current image of humanity leaves a stale feeling. And to relaunch a system with such inertia after weeks and months of deprivation, if many companies no longer exist, will take tremendous effort? Doctors will just go back to work, as usual. But to reboot whole economies and have a labour force with less pragmatic backgrounds returning to their jobs may be less evident.",

The first European Training Courses started in the 1970s, and the course sites are illustrative for the visionary European thinking of our predecessors. I refer you to our website to see that list and encourage you to upload your own material related to these events, should you happen to have something of interest.
