Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical features and risk factors of noninfectious ILD after HDCT in paediatric patients. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of paediatric solid tumour patients who underwent HDCT and autologous HSCT between 1997 and 2012. ILD was diagnosed using clinical symptoms and radiography after excluding cardiac, renal and infectious causes. Risk factors were analysed using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. Results: Three hundred and forty patients were enrolled, and the median age was 3 years (interquartile range 1-7). Eight patients (2.4%) were diagnosed with noninfectious ILD. The median duration of symptom onset was 30 months (range 7-74). Six (75%) of eight ILD patients died during the study period, even though steroids were administered for treatment.

In this study, cyclophosphamide was associated with an 11.3-times increased risk of ILD, and it raises a high suspicion for cyclophosphamide having a causative role in late-onset drug-induced ILD. Depletion of reduced glutathione and impaired antioxidant defences might be suggested as possible mechanisms. 25 According to the univariate analysis conducted in this study, MIBG treatment and female gender were ILD risk factors. MIBG shares the same uptake and release mechanism as norepinephrine, and it is used for the detection of neuroendocrine tumours or targeted radiotherapy for advanced neuroblastoma. 32,33 123 I-MIBG is also taken up by the lung through energyrequiring, sodium-dependent transport mechanism, so MIBG scintigraphy is used to assess pulmonary endothelial cell injury. 34 In 131 I MIBG mega-therapy groups, transient interstitial pneumonia and fatal pneumonia were reported, but the risk of pulmonary complications warrants further investigation. Even though gender was a risk factor in this study, the specific mechanism for this trend is not known. Gender-based differences in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in an animal study. 35 Male gender was also determined to be a risk factor for ILD in nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients who received gefitinib treatment. 36 The gender effect of the development of ILD after autologous HSCT needs to be studied. Total body irradiation (TBI, >1200 cGy) among patients older than 40 years is also known to produce a high risk for IPS. 22 However, TBI was not associated with ILD in this study, which may have been due to the young age of our patients or the lower dose of TBI (333 cGy/fraction, 3 fractions) that was used.
