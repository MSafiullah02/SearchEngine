These 64 guidelines may evolve as data on COVID-19 transmission improves, testing becomes faster, and 65 improved telemedicine platforms emerge. However, given the state of our current crisis, it is 66 imperative to implement guidelines in the interest of public health. This algorithm will maintain 67 access to inpatient dermatologic care, reduce patient and provider exposure to COVID-19, and 68 decrease unnecessary utilization of PPE. Given the current paucity of data, the following goals 69 are based on expert consensus within the Society of Dermatology Hospitalists, and have been 70 adopted by a plurality of member institutions within this society. the use of telemedicine consultation in order to minimize risk of COVID-19 74 exposure to both patients and consulting dermatologists. 752) Identify patients who are high-risk for exposing consulting dermatologists to COVID-19. 763) Limit the utilization of resources for low-risk in-person dermatology consults. 77 4) Provide a framework for predominantly outpatient dermatologists to utilize in the event 78 that they are required to staff inpatient dermatology consultations. 79 80Conclusion and Limitations: 81This algorithm is a logical way to implement triaging telemedicine consults within multiple 82 hospital settings while acknowledging that challenges exist. Institutional limitations may include 83 access to HIPAA-compliant photo-sharing, videoconferencing or electronic medical records. 84Additionally, as resources and medical staff become more limited, hospital-based dermatologists 85 and trainees may be conscripted to other facets of disaster relief. While this has been publicized 86 and debated within the specialty society, we believe it is of critical importance to provide this 87 algorithm to all dermatologists who may be providing consults during this unprecedented time. 8889We hope that these recommendations help to ensure effective, safe, and efficient dermatologic 90 care for hospitalized patients in the face of a global crisis. 91 92 Please contact us for any questions.
