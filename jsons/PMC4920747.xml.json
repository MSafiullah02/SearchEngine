A meta-analysis suggests that CPAP has a greater efficacy in reducing mortality.11 However, some other study12 suggests that BiPAP may be preferable for patients with persisting dyspnoea or hypercapnia after initiation of CPAP. Though there was an early concern about possible greater risk of myocardial infarction with NIPPV, subsequent study has not confirmed the same.13 In a multicentre randomised controlled trial14 that compared BiPAP (12/5 cm H2O) to CPAP (8 cm H2O), the two modes were equally effective in reducing respiratory frequency, disposal, and need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and in improving arterial blood gases. NIPPV benefits these patients by causing decreased left ventricular pre- and after-load owing to increased intrathoracic pressure, resulting in improved cardiac performance. Inotropic effect of raised intrathoracic pressure also helps by augmentation of cardiac contractility. Re-opening of collapsed alveoli increases the functional residual capacity (FRC). This improves oxygenation and reduces work of breathing. However, by reduction of preload, NIPPV can sometimes be counter-productive by decreasing cardiac output.",
