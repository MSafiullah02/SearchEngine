We obtained mobility data from the location-based services of Tencent (https://heat.qq.com). Users permit Tencent to collect their realtime location information when they install applications, such as WeChat (\u22481.13 billion active users in 2019) and QQ (\u2248808 million active users in 2019), and Tencent Map. By using the geolocation of users over time, Tencent reconstructed anonymized origin-destination mobility matrices by mode of transportation (air, road, and train) between 370 cities in China, including 368 cities in mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. The data are anonymized and include 28 million trips to and 32 million trips from Wuhan,",

In this model, Wj,t denotes the number of residents of Wuhan that travel to city j on day t and Mj,t denotes the number of from city j traveling to Wuhan on day t. Then, the rate at which infected residents of Wuhan travel to city j at time t is given as \u03b3j,t = \u03be(t) \u00d7 Wj,t and the rate at which travelers from city j get infected in Wuhan and return to their home city while still infected is \u03a8j,t = \u03be(t) \u00d7 Mj,t. This model assumes that newly infected visitors to Wuhan will return to their home city while still infectious.

From these, we derive the doubling time of incident cases as dT = log(2)/\u03bb and the cumulative number of cases and of reported cases by January 22, 2020. We also derived the basic reproduction number, by assuming a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovery (SEIR) model for COVID-19 in which the incubation period is exponentially distributed with mean L in the range of 3-6 days and the infectious period is also exponentially distributed with mean Z in the range of 2-7 days. The reproduction number is then given by R0",

We truncated our estimate 10 days before the quarantine to account for the estimated time between infection and case detection, assuming a 5-6 day incubation period (4,7-11) followed by 4-5 days between symptom onset and case detection (12, 13) . Given the uncertainty in these estimates, we also provide estimates assuming shorter and longer delays in the lag between infection and case reporting (Appendix Table 3 ).",
