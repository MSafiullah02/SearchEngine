The homology of the new coronavirus and SARS-like coronavirus in bats is more than 85%[1]. Currently, the number of COVID-19 patients is rapidly increasing worldwide, and some countries and regions, such as Africa, lack medical resources[2]. Therefore, it is of clinical significance to track and monitor a patient\u2019s condition by using the dynamic changes in routine laboratory indicators, as they have a short turnaround time, and radioactivity is not involved. Herein, we report the epidemiological history and dynamic changes in routine blood parameters during the process of diagnosis and treatment of a woman who was confirmed to have severe COVID-19.",

CRP was 208 mg/L on the 7th day, indicating a strong inflammatory response. At this stage, the virus prevailed, and the progressive decrease in WBCs was related to the direct invasion of the virus into hematopoietic cells or the aggravation of apoptosis and hematopoietic suppression caused by the infection of bone marrow stromal cells, which is basically consistent with the blood system performance after SARS virus infection[3].",
