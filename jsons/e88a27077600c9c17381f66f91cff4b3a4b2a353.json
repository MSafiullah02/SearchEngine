We conducted this study to help paediatricians To help pediatricians understand the conditions of COVID-19 in children, we conducted this study. Methods: We retrospectively summarized the characteristics, treatment and outcomes of pediatric cases in Wuhan children's hospital which was the only designated hospital for children with COVID-19 in Hubei Province. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with clinical outcomes. Results: As of February 29, 75 children had been discharged, of which only one was has severe pneumonia and one was critical cases. Children younger than 2 years were more susceptible to COVID-19. All patients have received interferon-\u03b1 nebulization, and eight cases including the severe and critical cases were co-administrated ribavirin. Five patients with mild pneumonia were given arbidol. Twenty-three patients were given traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The average length of stay (LOS) and the time of SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 10.57 and 6.39 days, respectively. None of the factors was associated with LOS or time of SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Conclusions: The severity of COVID-19 in pediatric cases were milder than adults. The efficacy of the antiviral therapy in children with COVID-19 remains to be evaluated.

Descriptive data were presented as number with percentages for categorical variables. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to analyze whether the continuous variables were normally distributed.
