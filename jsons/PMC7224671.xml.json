The virus is consecutively fused with the host cells. S1 subunit, via its receptor-binding domain, mediates the attachment of the spike protein. The protein changes its conformation after binding with the receptor. S2 domain of the spike protein is responsible for membrane fusion and internalization of the virus [8]. The host cell entry and spread are facilitated by priming of the spike protein of the virus by cellular transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [[9], [10], [11]].",

The other three patients with severe symptoms were enrolled for placebo control [9]. Clinical-grade human MSCs were intravenously administered to each of the seven patients. The patients were treated with 1 \u00d7 106 MSCs per kilogram body weight while their condition was worsening severely. They were observed for a total period of 14 days. Before the infusion of MSCs, all the patients had high fever (body temperatures ranging from 38.5 \u00b0C to 39 \u00b0C), reduced oxygen saturation, dyspnea (shortness of breath) and pneumonia. The study showed that almost all the symptoms displayed by the patients before infusion, subsided under 2-4 days after they received the infusion. The oxygen saturation, with or without oxygen uptake (approximately 5 liters/minute), rose to \u2265 95% at rest. The profile of the immune system constitution was investigated during MSC transplantation. CyTOF (mass cytometric) analysis of peripheral blood of the patient was done, revealing the fact that The peripheral lymphocytes increased after the treatment, with a shift towards the regulatory phenotype for both dendritic cells and CD4+T cells. In case of the two patients having common symptoms, no significant increase in dendritic cells (DC,CXCR3-) or CXCR3- (regulatory T cells) were reported. Whereas in the case of the patients with severe symptoms, both dendritic cells as well as regulatory T cells were found to have increased following the treatment. Also, in the 3 severe control patients enrolled for placebo treatment, no significant increase in CXCR3- dendritic cell were observed. The percentages of CXCR3+CD+T cells, CXCR3+CD4+T cells and CXCR3+ natural killer cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were remarkably high compared to the healthy control, before the MSC infusion. This triggered the cytokine storm as a result of inflammation. But within 6 days, it was found that the overactivation of natural killer cells, as well as T cells, nearly subsided, and the subpopulation of the cells reverted to the normal levels. The MSC infusion didn't show any side effects. CT scans of chest revealed that pneumonia infiltration was remarkably reduced. Most of the patients were reported negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test within 7-14 days after the infusion. The most exciting and extraordinary finding of the study was the overall improvement of an elderly patient who was critically ill previously.",

The study entitled \u201cA study to evaluate the potential role of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\u201d (clinical trial number: NCT01385644) was mainly aimed to provide evidence of safe infusion of placental MSCs from unrelated or related Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched or HLA identical donors in the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) treatment. Results of the study provided evidence of stabilized and improved lung function. The other study entitled human mesenchymal stem cells for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was aimed to infuse allogenic bone marrow derived human MSCs intravenously in patients having ARDS and assess the safety of the intravenous infusion (clinical trial number: NCT01775774). The study was conducted in two phases, with the first phase involving the intravenous infusion of stromal MSCs in 9 patients with ARDS. It was revealed that the infusion of the MSCs was safe and no treatment-related adverse events or infusion-linked events were reported [16]. The second phase of the study suggested that the severity of acute lung injury was reduced in a sheep model having bacterial pneumonia on treatment with hMSCs [17].",

            "text": "COVID-19 triggers an exaggerated immune reaction in the body by producing large amounts of various inflammatory factors including several cytokines, chemokines and immune reactive cells. It can be hypothesized that the MSC therapy might prevent the triggering of cytokine storm by the activated immune system, and the reparative properties of the stem cells might promote endogenous repair [18]. Mesenchymal stem cells when intravenously injected will lead to some part of the population getting entrapped in the lungs. While trapped within the lungs, a wide variety of soluble mediators, including antimicrobial peptides, anti-inflammatory cytokines, extracellular vesicles, and angiogenic growth factors are released by the MSCs [[19], [20], [21]]. The pattern of anti-inflammatory mediators released is specific for the inflammatory lung environment encountered. The pattern of these released mediators are regulated through differential activation of the damage and pathogen-associated molecular pathogen receptors expressed on the cell surfaces of MSCs, [22] including TLRs (toll-like receptors) that, in case of COVID-19, are activated by viral unmethylated CpF-DNA (TLR9) and viral RNA (TLR3), leading to sub sequential cellular signalling pathways and thereafter activation of MSCs [23]. Keratinocyte Growth Factor (KGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) secreted by MSCs promote the restoration of disrupted alveolar-capillary barriers due to the pathogenesis of ARDS [24]. Extracellular vesicles containing specific miRNA ans inhibitory mRNAs are also known to regulate the protective effects of MSCs in pre-clinical models of non-infectious acute lung inhuries or bacterial sepsis in lungs [25]. The pulmonary microenvironment could be recovered with the help of these MSCs, thus protecting the alveolar epithelial cells. Hence, pulmonary fibrosis of the lungs could be prevented, which may lead to curing COVID-19 caused pneumonia. In the multiple disease condition, the immunomodulatory effects will be responsible for improved function after MSC infusion. A variety of paracrine factors are secreted by these cells. These paracrine factors interact with the immune cells, eventually leading to immunomodulation. The vigorous anti-inflammatory activities of MSCs will actually be responsible for improvements after their infusion in COVID-19 patients.",

The expression of ISGs forestalls viral infection [26]. MSCs express several ISGs including Interferon Induced Transmembrane Family (IFITM), SAT1, IFI6, PMAIP1, ISG15, CCL2, p21/CDKN1a etc., many of which are known to show typical anti-viral responses.

Thus all the tissues and organs expressing the ACE2 receptor are susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the alveolar epithelial cells have a high propensity of ACE2 receptors, they are the most adversely affected during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The devastating cytokine explosion attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to severe shock, oedema and multiple organ failure. Administering the COVID-19 patients with an infusion of multipotent MSCs can help to combat the COVID-19 as these cells will inhibit the exaggerated immune response and encourage endogenous repair of the lung epithelial cells by improving the microenvironment. The mesenchymal stem cell therapy has not tey shown any adverse side effects on the patient. In this review we have highlighted all the implications associated with MSC therapy application in case of COVID-19 and strongly place our argument in support of this.",
