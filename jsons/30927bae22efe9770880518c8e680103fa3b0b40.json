As an indispensable part of TCM, Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 are highly valued and critically acclaimed in their campaign to contain and tackle the epidemic, they can achieve considerable effects for both suspected cases under medical observation period, and confirmed individuals with serious underlying diseases or critical conditions. Given this, based on the Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China, the present review summarized the basic information, clinical evidence and published literatures of recommended CPMs against COVID-19. The details were thoroughly introduced involving compositions, therapeutic effects, clinical indications, medication history of CPMs and the profiles of corresponding research. With regard to infected patients with different stages and syndrome, the preferable potentials and therapeutic mechanism of CPMs were addressed through the comprehensive collection of relevant literatures and on-going clinical trials. This study could provide an insight into clinical application and underlying mechanism of recommended CPMs against COVID-19, with the aim to share the Chinese experience in clinical practice and facilitate scientific development of TCM, especially CPMs in the fierce battle of COVID-19.",

Over the past few months, TCM exhibited remarkable benefits against COVID-19 in China, and it was convinced that TCM achieved satisfactory therapeutic superiority for patients infected by 2019-nCoV with regard to preventive treatment of diseases, comprehensive therapies and rehabilitation by the accumulation of clinical experience and scientific evidence [21] [22] . As recommended in the Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Revised 7th version) which was officially released by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, TCM could exert favorable effects for patients with different syndromes and distinct stages of COVID-19, contributing to infections in the periods of both medical observation and clinical treatment [23] . Recently, the latest official data showed that 91.5% of confirmed subjects with COVID-19 (74,187 cases) received TCM in China, and increasing results of clinical observation indicated that the total effective rate of TCM reached more than 90% [24] . These promising advantages were associated with its unique therapeutic principles including syndrome differentiation and treatment, boosting the individual's endogenous healing ability, balancing Yin and Yang, various therapies and personalized treatment in first-line clinic [25] [26] .",

Similarly, as an indispensable part of TCM, CPMs were substantial utilized in combination with western medicine for the management of COVID-19, and proposed as adjunctive and therapeutic options to fight the public health emergency of 2019-nCoV by national and provincial guidelines in China [31] [32] [33] . Given the paucity of published English research concerning CPMs against COVID-19 currently, the present review performed a descriptive analysis of recommended CPMs from both clinical trials and published literatures, based on the following aspects: information retrieved from their instructions (compositions, therapeutic effects, and clinical indications), medical evidence, pharmacodynamic mechanism, dominant components, applicable patients, clinical cautions and so on. As regarding to some types of CPMs without accessible published evidence for treating 2019-nCoV, we introduced the relevant results of infectious or health-threatening diseases. The aim of present review was to provide the scientific basis and share clinical experiences for promising choices of CPMs against COVID-19.",

Similarly, accumulated evidence displayed that its pharmacodynamic mechanisms were associated with the biological functions involving antiinflammation, inhibition of 2019-nCoV replication, affection of virus morphology, activation of Tcell, molecular response to bacterial origin, broad-spectrum antivirus, immune regulation and so on [49-52]. Meanwhile, compared with the control group that only receiving arbidol, Shufeng Jiedu Capsule combined with arbidol could achieve favorable effects in the treatment of COVID-19 and without reported drug-related adverse events, there were significant improvements in CD 4+ and CD 8+ T cell subpopulations, white blood cell and CT imaging, antipyretic time, the disappearance time of dry cough, nasal congestion, pharyngeal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and the negative conversion of nucleic acid examination for 2019-nCoV [53-54]. The latest research investigated the potential targets and mechanisms of Shufeng Jiedu Capsule for treating COVID-19 via constructing the \"drugcomponent-disease-target\" network, the results demonstrated that therapeutic mechanism involved a variety of biological processes such as the interaction of viral proteins with cytokines, with critical proteins as IL-6, ALB, MAPK3 [55]. For patients infected 2019-nCoV, the large amounts of cytokines might be associated with rapidly provoking of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), single or multiple organ failure, and eventually death. Therapeutic potentials for severe or critical patients Depending on the differentiation of clinical syndromes, the severe or critical subjects could receive the Chinese herbal injections that prescribed by Chinese herbalists or doctors, including Xiyanping Injection, Xuebijing Injection, Reduning Injection, Tanreqing Injection, Xingnaojing Injection [56].",

For example, Huoxiang Zhengqi CapsuleJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and Lianhua Qingwen Capsule was over-the-counter medicines, and some CPMs were covered by national lists of essential medicine and basic insurance program in China. Regarding suspected and mild patients with COVID-19, we calculated the frequency of compositions for each CPMs, the results revealed that the crude herbs with the higher frequency of recommended CPMs were Jinyinhua (Lonicerae Japonicae Flos), Lianqiao (Forsythiae Fructus) and Gancao (Glycyrrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma), and they all had therapeutic effects of clearing heat and detoxication, which could bring potential for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV. For instance, phillyrin, the natural lignan of Lianqiao, had antibacterial, anti-quorum sensing and antiinflammatory activities for the control of infectious pathogens via the regulation the MyD88/I\u03baB\u03b1/NF-\u03baB signalling pathway, decrease the virus titers and I\u03baB\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 levels, reduction the expression of influenza hemagglutinin protein, and attenuation of lung tissue damage [102-104]. With regard to severe cases, the Chinses herbal injections could obviously alleviate clinical symptoms and correct complications. In particular, Xuebijing injection was widely used for treating patients with critical diseases including sepsis, severe pneumonia, severe acute pancreatitis, infection-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ARDS, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and so on",

The selection of treatments for individuals infected 2019-nCoV should be consistent with the theory of TCM. For example, it was not suitable to receive tonic herbs and Lianhua Qiwen Capsule for cases with COVID-19 simultaneously. Besides, Huoxiang Zhengqi Liquid contained ethanol, which could cause disulfiram-like reaction combined with cephazolin, cefoperazone, cefoperazone and sulbactam, latamoxef and so on [116]. To overall contain the COVID-19 pandemic, except for support medication and equipment supply, we suggested that pharmacists should play important role in the guarantee of medication safety including prescription checking and the rational use of CPMs. Several limitations of our study should be noted. Unsatisfactory, there were lack of published research concerning on both COVID-19 and some recommended CPMs, such as those were only adjuvant rescue for critical infection (Suhexiang Pill, Angong Niuhuang Pill, Shenfu Injection, Shengmai Injection, Shenmai Injection). Thus, clinical benefits and therapeutic mechanism of CPMs against COVID-19 should be substantiated further confirmed and illustrated by the well-designed fundamental studies. Present review only focused on the recommended CPMs for treating COVID-19, except for the enrolled CPMs, it was noteworthy that plenty of prescriptions in TCM that were crucial to the prevention and management of COVID-2019, such as QingFei Paidu decoction, the relevant retrospective study showed that Qingfei Paidu decoction combined with western medicine",
