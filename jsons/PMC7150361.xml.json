P. multocida grows on blood agar and dextrose starch agar but not on MacConkey's agar. Some strains may require fresh blood for growth on nutrient agar, with cultural characteristics influenced by the type of blood used. Colonies grow larger and produce greenish discoloration on media with horse blood. P. multocida produces a distinctive odor, which bacteriologists liken to that of indole. Growth occurs under aerobic conditions or in 5% carbon dioxide. Temperature-sensitive and carbon dioxide\u2013sensitive strains may exist. Most isolates require 24 to 48 hours of incubation to become apparent on blood agar, especially if mixed with other bacteria. Blood agar with 2 \u03bcg/mL of clindamycin can be used to inhibit other bacteria in mixed cultures. Colonies are convex and smooth but vary in coloration from bluish to greenish iridescence when observed in obliquely transmitted light, and they may vary in mucoid appearance. Colonies of the mucoid strains appear to run together, if their numbers permit. Capsular type A strains have large capsules and produce mucoid colonies, whereas colonies of the type D strains may appear iridescent.",

Invasion and multiplication of the organism occur because the capsule, largely consisting of hyaluronic acid, which also is present in host tissues, inhibits phagocytosis and complement-activated bactericidal activity of serum (opsonization). Some type D strains, although ingested by phagocytes, resist bactericidal activity. Leukotoxic enzymes also are produced.

High levels of antibody to P. multocida correlate well with chronic infection. The test does not detect antibody very early in infection, because it takes 2 to 3 weeks for the titer to rise substantially. Antibody in a rabbit younger than 8 weeks of age is probably maternally acquired. Sera with antibodies to related bacteria, possibly normal flora, react at low levels in the test, giving false-positive results. Immunosuppression results in decreased antibody and possibly false-negative results. If a serum sample is reactive at a low level, testing of a second sample about 3 weeks later helps in determining whether the antibody level is increasing (early infection), decreasing (maternal antibody or infection eliminated), or remaining about the same (probably because of infection with related bacteria that are not necessarily pathogenic). The ideal test would be one that detects antibody to an antigenic epitope that is unique to P. multicoda,39 present in all strains, and associated with protective antibodies.21 A 37-kDa antigen was shown to be a major immunogen during P. multocida infection in rabbits. Monoclonal antibody against this antigen, used in a capture enzyme immunoassay, was shown to be sensitive and specific in identifying rabbits infected with P. multocida.\n25\n",

Penicillin given parenterally is less likely to cause dysbiosis than if given orally, and it is the antibiotic of choice for anaerobic infections. The use of any antimicrobial agent in rabbits warrants monitoring. In the event of anorexia, diarrhea, or excretion of abnormal feces, discontinue use of the antibiotic and select a different drug.",

A rabbit recently acquired from a pet store should be examined, tested for P. multocida infection, and, if infected, treated with antibiotics. Elimination of infection may be easier in young rabbits, before disease becomes chronic. If rhinitis is severe and exudate is being expelled by sneezing, isolate the affected animal from other rabbits and ensure that infectious exudate is not spread by fomites. Transmission from rabbits with chronic pasteurellosis is less common than from those acutely affected. Some infected rabbits have lived in relatively close contact with uninfected rabbits and have not transmitted the organism (Fig. 17-9\n). Germicidal agents that are effective against P. multocida include a 10% solution of sodium hypochlorite 5.25%, 1 oz/gal of 2% chlorhexidine diacetate, and 2 mL/gal of 20% benzalkonium chloride; 70% alcohol is not effective. Controlling the spread of infection in the host depends on proper diet, avoidance of stress or changes in ambient temperature, and good husbandry practices, including good ventilation, as well as treatment with antibiotics.",
