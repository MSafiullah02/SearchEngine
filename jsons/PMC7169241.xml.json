Second, virus in nonsedimenting aerosol resides in a closed (indoors) environment for hours while virus in sedimenting droplets remains suspended in air only for seconds after expulsion. Aerosolized virus can be inhaled as long as a subject is in a room, whereas droplets have a much smaller time window during which they are accessible for deposition on mucosal surfaces.
