            "text": "Children can play a variety of roles in emerging infectious diseases. They can be victims, as in the vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus infection. They can be affected in a minor way compared with adults, as in West Nile virus infection, legionellosis, and coronavirus infection leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Sometimes, however, they play predominant roles-sources for other age groups-as do toddlers in out-of-the-home child care for transmission of penicillinresistant pneumococci and cytomegalovirus to family members. Children have a uniquely central role in transmitting the influenza viruses that cause annual seasonal outbreaks and epidemic disease and could cause global epidemic (or pandemic) disease. Children themselves suffer excessive morbidity and mortality from influenza. Continuous minor changes in virus neuraminidase and haemagglutinin components (antigenic drift) or a major change in either (antigenic shift) render na\u00efve children especially vulnerable. Anticipating that pandemic influenza could occur at any time because of a major change in a human strain of influenza virus or through acquisition of human transmissibility of reassortant avian influenza strain(s) (Nicholson et al., 2003) , the international community of healthcare experts are collaborating increasingly, and countries are drafting influenza pandemic preparedness plans. A draft by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of \"Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan\" was released for comment in August 2004 (http://www.hhs.gov/ nvpo/pandemicplan). All plans highlight the critical importance of international surveillance, openness, and rapid response to investigate and contain emergent avian or human strains. In the midst of concern for novel influenza viruses, an apparently novel clinical manifestation of extant influenza virus has emerged recently. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a new and severe manifestation of influenza in children.",

Influenza-associated illnesses in children are not restricted to acute respiratory syndromes with systemic complaints or complications, and can involve a variety of organ systems (Table 1 .1). Children under the age of 2 years have substantially higher risk of hospitalization than do older children. There are more than 10,000 children younger than 2 years of age hospitalized for influenza annually in the United States; rates of hospitalization range from approximately 200 to 500 per 100,000 population. The risk of hospitalization among children less than 4 years of age in one study was approximately 100 per 100,000 in healthy children and 500 per 100,000 in children with underlying conditions (Neuzil et al., 2000) . The overall health impact of influenza in children, and the risk of hospitalization among children younger than 2 years of age, is similar to or greater than that among high-risk children and healthy 50-to 64-year-old adults (both groups for whom annual influenza immunization has been recommended in the United States for years). Recognizing this, universal influenza vaccine was recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2004 for healthy children 6 months to 24 months of age and for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers of all children younger than 24 months of age (Committee on Infectious Diseases, AAP, 2004; Table 1 .2).

As gleaned from descriptions, the disease probably was in some cases influenza virus encephalitis and in others post-infectious encephalitis. We recognize both syndromes as occurring currently, sporadically during annual influenza seasons. In addition, rarely, hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy, as well as Reye's syndrome can be associated with influenza, the latter especially but not always in conjunction with use of aspirin. The CNS disease represented by our case, ANE, was first described in Japanese children in 1995. By 1998, 148 cases of ANE were reported in Japan (Morishima et al., 2002) and it was estimated subsequently that more than 100 deaths were occurring annually in Japanese children from influenza-associated ANE (Kasai et al., 2000) . Emergence of ANE in Japan occurred the year after cessation in 1994 of routine annual influenza immunization in children, a policy that had been in place since 1960s. Influenza A and B viruses were associated with direct proportion to causation of uncomplicated respiratory tract infection. In the United States, physicians were alerted to ANE in late 2003 and were encouraged to report cases to the CDC. More than 103 possible cases were reported. At this time, the reports of only a minority of cases meeting the screening case definition of having proven influenza plus more than 24 hr of altered mental status have been investigated.

Influenza virus infection is necessary, but ANE is an uncommon event among infected individuals. While virus is present in the respiratory tract in ANE cases, viral RNA can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid of \u03fd10% of affected children, and the presence of virus in brain tissue in autopsied cases has not been proven despite testing by culture and gene amplification. This with the absence of inflammatory cells in the CSF or in samples of brain tissue suggests that direct viral invasion leading to tissue damage is unlikely to be the cause of CNS disease. On the other hand, in influenza-associated encephalopathy, elevated concentrations in the serum or CSF or both of several proinflammatory cytokines and cytokine receptors-interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u2424, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, soluble TNF receptor-1 (sTNF-R1)-have been documented, with elevations in proportion to the clinical severity of disease (Ichiyama et al., 1998; Togashi et al., 1999; Aiba et al., 2001) . In 2003, Kawada et al. further demonstrated up-regulation of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha genes in patients with influenza-associated ANE, strengthening the postulation that glial cells in the CNS are cytokine releasing cells (similar to blood macrophages) that can overproduce pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to respiratory tract influenza virus, causing a \"cytokine storm\" in the CNS.",

Intranasal inoculation causes viral spread to the olfactory bulbs, then to the trigeminal ganglion, and later to the brainstem, pons, cerebellum, reticular formation, and posterior colliculi. Virus subsequently spreads to the respiratory tract and bloodstream. Following intraperitoneal inoculation, virus spreads predominantly to the visceral organs, lungs, and bloodstream with no involvement of the midbrain or brainstem and only occasional evidence of virus presence in the CNS, in the lining of the ventricles. In a further experimental step, passively transferred antibody in high levels protected against both routes of inoculation.",

Occurrence of ANE in unimmunized children; the timing of encephalopathy early in the course of the influenza illness; the site, symmetry, and pattern of magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities; and inability to detect virus in serum or CSF of most affected patients, all support this pathogenetic sequence. It is further speculated that cytokine-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier could lead additionally to \"backward flow\" of accumulated cytokines into the circulation to cause the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that appears to follow CNS malfunction in some patients (Morishima et al., 2002) . At neuronal level, these aberrant responses lead to mitochondrial respiratory failure, edema, and apoptotic and necrotic cell death (Yokota et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "If validated, what new virus-associated, host-associated, or environmental factor might be postulated to explain the emergence of influenza-associated cytokine deregulation that leads to ANE? No single influenza strain or unusual epidemic was identified in association with ANE in Japan. Emergence of ANE after cessation of routine immunization may indicate importance of rapid spread or primary infections in children. First recognition in Japanese children suggested a possible genetic predisposition, which has not been discounted. However, description of cases in the United States and anecdotally in many European countries, notably in children of non-Asian ancestry, makes a racial genetic predisposition unlikely. It is likely that a changing environmental factor may be responsible. In Japan, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (especially diclofenate sodium and mephenamate) in febrile children was common by the mid-1990s, and NSAID use has recently become common in the United States. The NSAIDs belong to the class of medications known as cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors. They have antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Antipyretic effect is attributable predominantly to inhibition of COX-derived prostaglandin E2. Direct anti-inflammatory effect of suppressing leukocyte-endothelial cells interactions, as well as causing fever-dependent and-independent dysregulation of inflammatory mediators could cause aberrant host-virus interactions. Does NSAID use in the context of early uninhibited virus replication in the nose precipitate or facilitate the CNS \"cytokine storm\"? Currently, a case-control study is ongoing in Japan to clarify the relationships between these drugs and the occurrence and severity of ANE. Meanwhile, pediatricians in Japan, highly attuned to influenza-associated ANE, now advise against the usage of NSAIDs in children with suspected influenza.",

If an environmental exposure such as NSAID use is identified, a remarkable opportunity for prevention exists. With the early imperfect evidence of possible associations of aspirin with Reye's syndrome, this clinician advised against aspirin use in children. Not fearful that failure to provide aspirin then or NSAIDs now would negatively impact upon children, it seems prudent to advise parents of children with possible influenza to (1) provide comfort, (2) avoid use of NSAIDs, and (3) give acetaminophen or paracetamol judiciously and carefully. There are decades of history of non-deleterious effect of these agents on the course of influenza in children. However, there are also reports of severe hepatic toxicity and fatality from inadvertent overdose of acetaminophen, especially in infants and during viral illnesses (Committee on Drugs, AAP, 2001). The most effective means of preventing influenza-associated morbidities is the widespread use of influenza vaccine as recommended in children and their caretakers in the healthcare system, at home, and in the community.",
