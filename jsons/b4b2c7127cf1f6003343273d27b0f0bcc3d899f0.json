            "text": "Conventional cancer therapies possess a plethora of limitations which led to the awakening of nanotechnology and nanomedicine. However, technological success is widely dependent on complete understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of tumor biology on one hand and nanobiointeractions associated with challenges of synthesis, translation, and commercialization on the other. The present study therefore deals with one such targeted approach aiming at synthesizing, characterizing, and understanding the efficacy of molybdenum oxide nanoparticles. The phase structure, morphology, and elemental composition of the synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The cytotoxicity studies revealed that the IC 50 vales of molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 ) particles against skin cancer cells (melanoma and nonmelanoma) were around 200-300 \u03bcg. The nanoparticles were found to induce mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis driven by the apoptotic genes such as BAX and Bcl 2 . Molybdenum being a cofactor for the majority of metabolic enzymes could have triggered the selective internalization of the nanoparticles which in turn could have modified the granularity of the cytoplasm and subsequently lead to mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Further, the anti-angiogenic property of MoO 3 nanoparticles was corroborated using Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and aortic ring assay. Taken together , unraveling the role of MoO 3 nanoparticles in cancer and angiogenesis opens up venues for nano biological intervention of selective cancer cell targeting with minimal damage to the normal cells using natural trace elements that are generally known to influence various metabolic enzymes.",

            "text": "Nanomaterials with its awe-inspiring nanostructures have revamped the medical field owing to their plethora of inherent functional properties [1] . Among the various nanomaterials, nanoparticles have revolutionized modern therapeutics owing to their high specific surface area and inherent photocatalytic, optical, structural, mechanical, and magnetic properties in addition to their efficacy in permeability and retention. Further, unique features for drug delivery, diagnosis and imaging, synthetic vaccine development, and medical devices give promising hope for cancer. Cancer, a global life-threatening pathology, is scientifically defined as an uncontrolled proliferation and spread of abnormal cells. Tremendous efforts are being made in understanding its pathogenesis and developing drugs to combat cancer. In spite of enormous research, the high incidence rate and rapid recurrence make cancer a more challenging disease. Among other types, the prevalence of skin cancer is rapidly increasing due to cumulative exposure to adverse UV rays [2, 3] . Although skin cancer does not have any significant mortality rate, it is among the most commonly reported cancers all over the world. There are diverse types of skin cancers like basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Melanoma cancers, in particular, have tendency to metastasize through regional lymph nodes to distant organs such as liver, lungs, and bone, and if metastasized, the probability of 5-year survival rate from diagnosis is reported to be decreased by 80% [4] . The present treatment strategies for skin cancer like radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery are plagued with side effects and unwarranted recurrences. Nanotechnology-based targeted drug delivery and therapeutic applications including diagnostic sensors and radiation therapy are in vogue [5] . Nanoparticles, nanofibers, etc. have been used to deliver a variety of biomolecules and drugs to their target site [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In certain cases, the drugs themselves are also made into nanoparticles and are targeted to the required site [7] . The nanotechnological applications are widely used due to their high surface area to encapsulate the drug and extremely small size for easy penetration into the cell membrane [8] . Several reports on nanoparticles and its anti-cancer activity are available, but a lacuna is still present in developing an efficient mode of transport to carry the drug with minimal wastage and side effects arising due to unwanted drug leaching. Metal nanoparticles or metal oxide nanoparticles [9] such as Au [10] , TiO 2 [11] , ZnO [12] , CeO 2 [13] , and FeO [14] hold an important position in cancer therapeutics for their potential toxicity against cancer cells. They serve a major role in photothermal therapy and also help in targeting radiation towards the cancer cells [15] . Molybdenum, an essential trace element, serves as a cofactor for various enzymes such as xanthine dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase, and nitrate reductase [16] . The permissible amount of molybdenum in circulation is 2 mg/day and complexes of molybdenum have also shown an anti-diabetic activity [17] . Molybdenum oxide has a strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption in the near infrared region, which would enable them to play a major role in photothermal therapy for ablation of cancer cells [18] . Molybdenum oxide serves as a cheaper alternate for noble metals and has vital applications in cancer therapeutics. In nanoscale, its oxide form is non-toxic and safe when compared with other metal oxides [19] . Molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 ) nanoparticles are reported to have an anti-microbial activity at minimal levels against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by activating membrane stress in the pathogen [20, 21] . Recently, these metal oxide nanoparticles are reported to induce significant toxicity towards invasive breast cancer cell lines. This paper essentially deals with unearthing the inherent potential of molybdenum oxide nanoparticles exhibiting selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells through mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway.",

All of which are more reactive than oxygen (O 2 ) itself. These molecules are majorly involved in the activation of the apoptosis cascade through mitochondria. The increasing ROS generation in a cellular system increases the oxidative damage to the cellular components and thereby pushes the cells to an apoptotic state [26] . Hence, the involvement of MoO 3 in ROS production is tested using a molecular probe DCFH-DA. DCFH-DA is a molecular probe that is permeable through the plasma membrane. This gets oxidized into DCF which emits fluorescence by the intracellular ROS that is present. Thereby, the greater the fluorescence is, the greater is the ROS present internally. Figure 7 shows the phase contrast and fluorescent microscopic images of control A431 cells and cells treated with IC 50 concentration of MoO 3 nanoparticles. The presence of DCF is more prominent in the nanoparticle-treated cell lines. This concludes that the ROS generation was significantly higher in the A431 cells treated with MoO 3 . This ROS produced subsequently causes the mitochondria to activate the apoptotic cascade.",

The intrinsic pathway is majorly initiated by the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane. Hence, to test the apoptotic pathway of the synthesized nanoparticle, JC-1 (5,5\u2032,6,6\u2032-tetrachloro-1,1\u2032,3,3\u2032-tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide) was used to analyze the mitochondrial membrane potential of the treated and untreated samples. JC-1 is a cationic dye that gets aggregated in the mitochondria of live and healthy cells due to the intact mitochondrial membrane potential and gives a red color. Whereas, if there is any damage in the mitochondrial membrane, the polymer does not aggregate in the mitochondria but gets distributed in the cytoplasm as monomers which gives out green florescence [27] . Figure 8 signifies that the MoO 3 nanoparticle-treated cells emit a bright green fluorescence when compared to the control cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential dropped drastically in the MoO 3 -treated cells, which caused the dye to exhibit itself in monomeric state. This clearly proves that the MoO 3 nanoparticles have caused mitochondrial membrane damage in the cultured A431 cell lines. This confirms the cytotoxicity towards cancer cells caused by MoO 3 due to mitochondrial membranemediated apoptosis of skin cancer cell lines.",

Hence, a molecule which kills cancer cells and also inhibits angiogenesis would serve as an ideal anti-cancer drug. Molybdenum salts are said to have anti-angiogenic properties in nature [29] .

During apoptosis, the cells exchange their peripheral phospholipid, i.e., phosphatidyl serine (PS), from the inner side of the cell membrane to the outer side exposing it to the extracellular space. Annexin V is a 35-kDa Ca 2+ -dependent phospholipid binding protein which binds with PS but is incapable of entering the lipid bilayer (plasma membrane) when the cell is alive but when the cell is undergoing apoptosis, due to the flipping of PS from the inner side of the plasma membrane to the outer space causes interaction between Annexin (V) and PS. Annexin (V) is attached to the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), an indicator for cells attached to Annexin (V)[28]. When the cells are stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI, they are subjected to falling: in the first quadrant are unstained cells, the second quadrant are early apoptotic cells (they are stained only by Annexin V-FITC), the third quadrant are late apoptotic cells (they are stained by Annexin V-FITC and PI, as their cell membrane and nuclear membrane are also compromised due to apoptosis), and the fourth quadrant are necrotic cells (the cells only stained with PI due to the loss of their cell membrane).Figure 9shows the flow cytometry results of cells treated with IC 50 concentration of MoO 3 nanoparticle. Since the MoO 3 nanoparticle was incubated for 16 h, the cells have reached an early apoptotic stage. As the incubation time increases, the cells will go to late apoptotic stage and then cell death. This quantitates the number of cells that undergo apoptosis after treating with MoO 3 nanoparticles.",
