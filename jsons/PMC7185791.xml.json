This framework, with a draft definition of an HLIU, was shared throughout the network, and revised to incorporate comments and additional evidence. We used a questionnaire that offered alternative solutions to particular design and management issues (eg, location and staffing of HLIUs, necessity for high efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filtration) to structure group discussions, clarify preferred options, and agree consensus refinements of the drafts at the third network meeting in 2007.10 We then prepared this report, and shared it, and subsequent revisions, until the content was agreed by all.",

The team undertakes the routine tasks (eg, phlebotomy, cleaning, food service, linen changing, patient or specimen transport, record keeping) that would usually be undertaken by others (phlebotomists, housekeepers, clerks, porters).

The participants also regarded input from critical care clinicians as essential to patient management. HLIUs should therefore be equipped to provide the level of care available in an intensive care unit, and critical care clinicians should routinely train alongside the HLIU team. Support from other specialties (eg, nephrology, paediatrics, cardiology) had also been needed, so specialist clinicians should also be pre-identified and train alongside the HLIU team. Additionally, needs for specialist non-clinical expertise (eg, to repair ventilation systems or maintain near-patient testing equipment) should be assessed, and relevant staff trained appropriately in advance.

Sweden, Germany, Italy, and the UK have arrangements for, and experience of, national and international aeromedical transport. Transport in stretcher isolators is unpleasant for the patient, and limits patient care, so might be unsuitable for critically ill patients.32, 33 High-level personal protective equipment (eg, impervious suit, powered air purifying respirator) can be used for short shifts only (less than 4 h), which limits the length of journeys that can be undertaken, and the suits, motors, and filters are easily damaged. In the past 40 years, patients with symptomatic haemorrhagic fever virus infections have travelled by road, by public airline, and by unmodified air casualty transport without the detection of a secondary case,34, 35, 36 so that it is now believed that almost all such patients can be managed by transport in standard ambulances, with appropriate personal protective equipment for staff. International guidance on epidemic-prone acute respiratory disease and recommendations on the management of suspected smallpox do not require patient transport by modified ambulance.20, 37, 38 Therefore, EUNID does not consider that ambulances with controlled ventilation systems are essential, but recognises that, in some countries, national authorities regard them as desirable, and so have invested in their use. Formal arrangements, which might involve cooperation between international agencies, non-governmental organisations, and civilian and military medical services, could help to overcome the challenges of arranging an international aeromedical evacuation.Panel 4Transport of patients to the HLIU\nEUNID recommends that:\n\n\u2022The decision to transport a patient to the HLIU must be based on expert clinical risk assessment\u2022The appropriate transport mode and vehicle type should be determined by expert risk assessment\u2022Staff and others who might be exposed to the patient during the journey should wear appropriate personal protective equipment, as determined by expert risk assessment, and should be subject to the same health surveillance after the journey as potentially exposed HLIU staff\u2022The ambulance and any fixed equipment used must be able to be effectively decontaminated (by wiping, spraying, or fogging with an effective disinfectant, according to national policy)\u2022The ambulance crew must be trained in the protocol for transport of patients with highly infectious diseases\u2022The HLIU should have an external, securable, area for ambulance parking and decontamination, and procedures for safe decontamination of ambulance equipment, including safe storage before decontamination\u2022The HLIU should have an admission route from the ambulance area to the unit entrance that can be controlled and secured, and that is wide enough to permit transfer of patient, staff, and equipment\u2022An ambulance used to transport a highly infectious disease patient should not be returned to normal use until the vehicle (and any fixed equipment in it) has been decontaminated\n",

            "text": "Controlled ventilation systems (panel 5\n) reduce the risk of infection with obligate airborne pathogens.14, 44, 45, 46, 47 Although most highly infectious diseases are not primarily transmitted by the airborne route, the risk of opportunistic airborne transmission of SARS and influenza infections, through exposure to droplet nuclei during aerosol-generating procedures, might be increased in poorly ventilated environments. Therefore, WHO suggests that airborne isolation precautions could be used when aerosol-generating procedures are undertaken on these patients, and also recommends that inpatients with an acute respiratory disease caused by a novel pathogen with potential for high public-health impact should be managed in airborne isolation until routes of transmission have been clarified.37, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 Airborne transmission of smallpox can occur; therefore, all guidelines recommend airborne infection isolation for suspected cases.12, 20, 37, 51 European legislation on containment measures for patients who have, or who may have, an infection with a group 3 or group 4 biological agent has been interpreted in supplemental legislation in some countries as requiring airborne infection isolation for all these infections, which include viral haemorrhagic fevers.22, 51, 52, 53 Furthermore, flexible-use HLIUs may be used to care for patients with tuberculosis, measles, or chickenpox (all of which require airborne infection isolation) or to isolate laboratory technicians after occupational exposure to a pathogen of unknown transmissibility. EUNID therefore recommends that HLIUs be designed for airborne infection containment.15, 17, 39, 40, 41, 42\nPanel 5Ventilation systems and air handling in HLIUs\nEUNID recommends that:\n\n\u2022The HLIU ventilation system is independent of the other building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems\u2022Each patient room should have an anteroom\u2022Air flows and pressure gradients within the HLIU run from the cleanest to the most contaminated areas; with the patient room at negative air pressure relative to adjacent areas, and a suggested differential pressure gradient of more than 15 Pa between patient room and anteroom and between anteroom and the rest of the unit, and an effective ventilation rate of at least 12 air changes per h in the patient room\u2022Air from the HLIU is not recirculated, and exhaust air is vented 100% to the outside of the building\u2022Exhaust air is discharged at a site and distance from the building that minimises the risk of contamination of occupants of the building (eg, by down-draught into open windows) and the community\u2022HEPA filtration of exhausted air is preferable, and, if there is any possible risk of re-entry of exhaust air or of human exposure to exhausted air, obligatory\u2022HEPA filtration of supply air may be considered\u2022HEPA filters are appropriately protected by pre-filters, housed correctly, and sited for ease of safe access for maintenance39, 40, 41, 42, 43\n\u2022HLIU ventilation systems are designed to fail safe, and to minimise cross-contamination in the event of system failure in the unit or elsewhere on the site (eg, built-in redundancy\u2014HLIU ventilation system with dual fans each capable of exhausting 100% air; air flow shutdown system independent of site system to protect against unwanted shutdown after alarm elsewhere on site; interlocking supply and exhaust systems, so that supply fan is prevented from running if exhaust fans fail)\u2022HLIU ventilation systems are connected to an emergency back-up power source\u2022Commissioning of ventilation systems includes functional (\u201cin-use\u201d) testing\u2022Ventilation systems incorporate current best practice performance checking tools (eg, visual pressure check gauges, audible alarms); have a schedule for planned preventive maintenance, and that HLIUs have written protocols for performance-checking the ventilation system that comply with all relevant European and national regulations and current standards of best practice\n",

The process is easily controllable, and hospital engineers are usually experienced in equipment maintenance and validation. However, autoclaving is time consuming, and energy inefficient. Large quantities of clinical waste are generated during the care of patients with highly infectious diseases, especially when critically ill: a 4-day admission of a single patient with suspected Lassa fever in an HLIU in the UK generated three industrial skip loads of double-bagged clinical waste. One HLIU has a protocol for removing all packaging and protective wrapping from disposable and other equipment in a clean area, before taking the equipment into the clinical area. Packaging and other discarded materials (eg, information leaflets) are disposed of as domestic waste (which may include recycling), cutting the quantity of waste needing autoclaving by about a half. A similar process led to savings of 25\u201330% in energy expenditure in a hospital in Saudi Arabia.59 Alternatives to autoclaving include microwave treatment, compaction combined with chemical treatment, which reduces the risks of aerosols but requires the use of chemicals that pose their own risks, and grinding combined with ozone injection, which is unsuitable for waste that might contain group 4 pathogens.60, 61, 62 Local use of special treatment processes has disadvantages: a scarcity of maintenance expertise, greater system complexity, deterioration of equipment through infrequent, intermittent use, and difficulties in obtaining spare parts could all contribute to reduced system functionality and safety.",

Guidance in the USA recommends disposal of liquid waste (eg, blood, urine, vomit) without pretreatment by pouring into the sanitary sewer.13 A unit in the UK converts all liquid waste from the patient to a gel by use of specially formulated absorbent crystals that are added as degradable sachets to disposable containers/urinals immediately before use. The gel is then managed as solid waste by autoclaving. This procedure avoids contamination of the drainage system with high concentrations of viruses, and protects health-care workers from the risk of spillage. The unit uses this method for peritoneal dialysate (which can contain high concentrations of virus, even if not blood-stained63), and for fluids collected when setting up haemodialysis equipment or rinsing the blood compartment at the end of the session,64 but haemodialysis ultrafiltrate (likely to contain no, or very low, concentrations of virus because particles of more than 7 nm diameter will be retained by the filtration membrane64, 65, 66, 67) is disposed of directly into the dirty drains system. Alternative decontamination methods include chemical disinfection, although the chemicals used might be ineffective in the presence of organic matter and are potentially hazardous to health-care workers, and heat treatment, which requires storage of wastes until treated and needs complex equipment and engineering controls.",

Since HLIUs are specifically designed to provide high-level infection control and best possible patient care without compromising the safety of carers or the community, the design and construction values must be specified to ensure this. We suggest that planners seek early advice from clinicians and managers in existing HLIUs. Unit design should also minimise the stressful effects of isolation on the patient, and provide a good working environment for staff.Panel 8Overall design and construction requirements for HLIUs\nThe HLIU should:\n\n\u2022Be colocated with a tertiary referral hospital, either in an entirely separate building on the same site, or as a separate unit (with a secure, controllable, entrance/exit route) within the hospital\u2022Be designed and constructed in compliance with relevant European, national, and local regulations and codes\u2022Have a separate, securable, entrance; double, inter-locking doors are ideal\u2022Be designed internally so that movement of \u201cclean\u201d and \u201ccontaminated\u201d staff, patients, and equipment through the unit ensures segregation of \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d areas\u2022Have integral autoclave facilities, or safe access to pre-identified, dedicated autoclave facilities\u2022Have an integral BSL3 or equivalent laboratory, or access to one in close proximity on the same campus\u2022Have an adequate storage area for large equipment\u2022Have adequate storage space for supplies of personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals (including controlled drugs), and clinical supplies\u2022Have a sealable area for decontamination of large equipment\u2022Have a designated area for handling and packaging clinical waste\u2022Have an area for the temporary safe-keeping of deceased patients, large enough to contain and decontaminate trolleys, sealable coffins, and other mortuary equipment\u2022Have a staff rest area\u2022Have a staff office area\u2022Have staff changing and showering facilities\u2022Have a decontamination shower\u2022Be designed and constructed for ease of cleaning and decontamination (eg, seamless floors and walls, solid horizontal surfaces)\u2022Have building, electrical, ventilation, and other systems that are designed and constructed for easy and safe access for maintenance\u2022Have a safe, securable pathway for emergency evacuation of staff and patients\u2022Have a connection to an emergency power-generating system\u2022Have standard life-safety systems (eg, automatic sprinkler systems) that are compliant with current European, national, and local regulation, with an independent airflow shutdown system\nPanel 9Design and construction requirements for high-level patient isolation rooms\nPatient isolation rooms in the HLIU should:\n\n\u2022Be large enough to contain the specialist equipment (eg, mechanical ventilator, haemofiltration machine, monitoring equipment) needed for critical care, and to allow free movement by staff wearing personal protective equipment\u2022Have a self-closing door, with well-fitted, durable, door seals\u2022Have a non-hand operated wash basin for clinical use in the patient's room\u2022Have a non-hand operated wash basin for clinical use in the anteroom\u2022Have an en-suite bathroom (toilet, hand basin, and shower); entrance to bathroom should be from within the patient's room, not the anteroom\u2022Have a system for visually monitoring the patient and room from the outside, which is flexible enough to maintain patient privacy, dignity, and safety\u2022Have a high-quality patient\u2013clinician communication system\u2022Have a high-quality clinician\u2013clinician communication system\u2022Have an emergency alarm system so that help can be summoned immediately if need be\u2022Have an anteroom (or equivalent designated area) large enough to store immediately necessary personal protective equipment and clinical supplies (eg, intravenous fluids and tubing, syringes, dressings, specimen containers)\u2022Have an adequate area for packaging clinical specimens and for decontaminating outer specimen containers\u2022Be designed and constructed for ease of cleaning and decontamination\u2022Have sealed windows\u2022Be designed and constructed to be as airtight as possible (ie, monolithic ceilings, tightly fitting doors and windows, door grill designed for a controlled air path); other design features that enhance the functionality of the ventilation system may also be desirable (eg, interlocking door system, with clinician controlled override function, which ensures that the patient room\u2013anteroom door and anteroom\u2013corridor door cannot both be opened at the same time)\n",

The renewed interest in biodefence-related research, fuelled by fear of bioterrorism, has meant that more laboratories are working with group 4 pathogens than at any time in the past 50 years, which has increased the likelihood that occupationally acquired infections requiring HLIU-based care will occur.68 In 2004, for example, a laboratory technician in the USA was admitted to an HLIU for observation after occupational exposure to Ebola virus, and a Russian laboratory worker died of occupationally acquired Ebola haemorrhagic fever.69 Laboratory personnel working on newly emergent infections can also be at risk of infection, and might, if diagnosis and containment is delayed, transmit infection to others.70 Infections caused by hazardous pathogens or by newly emerging infections of unknown transmissibility are likely to occur, or be imported, too infrequently in Europe to generate widespread experience or confidence in their management, but sufficiently often enough to justify the maintenance of centres of expertise where they can be most effectively and safely managed.71, 72, 73, 74, 75\n",
