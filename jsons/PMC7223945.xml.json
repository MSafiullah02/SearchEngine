However, their role in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with respiratory tract infections is controversial. Currently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society guidelines for hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia recommend the addition of inhaled antibiotics in patients with VAP due to Gram-negative bacilli that are susceptible to only aminoglycosides or polymyxins (very low-quality evidence) and consider reasonable the adjunctive inhaled therapy as a last-resort treatment in patients who are not responding to intravenous therapy alone, whether the infecting organism is or is not multidrug-resistant [6]. In contrast, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases recommends avoiding the use of nebulized antibiotics for the treatment of respiratory infections in invasively mechanically ventilated adults due to a weak level of evidence of their efficacy and the high potential for underestimated risks of adverse events [7].",

The presence of a new and progressive or persistent infiltrate on chest radiography was the major distinguishing feature between pneumonia and tracheobronchitis, which was not present in the latter. A diagnosis of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis registered by a physician in the patient chart was mandatory for considering the inclusion of the patients in the study.
