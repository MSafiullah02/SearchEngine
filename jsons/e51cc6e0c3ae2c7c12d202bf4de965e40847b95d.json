Its success too has been formidable: in 1991, the Pan American Health Organization effectively eradicated polio from the Western Hemisphere, since when the Global Polio Eradication Programme has significantly decreased the overall incidence of Poliomyelitis through the rest of the world.

In the next decade, effective, widespread vaccination programs against such pathogenic microbes could save the lives of 7.6 million children under 5 years of age. Hepatitis B causes 600,000 deaths in adults and children aged over 5. Seasonal, non-pandemic influenza kills upwards of half a million globally each year. For those aged under 5 in particular, a series of diseases causes an extraordinary and largely preventable death toll. For example, tetanus accounts every year for 198,000 deaths, pertussis is responsible for over 290,000 deaths, Hib gives rise to in excess of 386,000 deaths, diphtheria accounts for 4,000 deaths, and yellow fever over 15,000 deaths. Arguably, the most regrettable, the most lamentable situation is that of measles. Measles accounts for the unneeded deaths of 540,000 under-fives and over 70,000 adults and older children.",

The medical need, as stated above, is clear. Set against this is the unfortunate realisation that vaccines exist for most easily targeted diseases, those mediated by neutralising antibodies, and so outstanding vaccine-targets are those of more intractable diseases mediated primarily by cellular immunity. To address those properly requires what all discoveries required: hard work and investment; but they also need new ideas, new thinking, and new vaccine discovery technology.

Whole antigen discovery. When looking at a reverse vaccinology process, the discovery of candidate subunit vaccines begins with a microbial genome, perhaps newly sequence, progresses through an extensive computational stage, ultimately to deliver a shortlist of antigens which can be validated through subsequent laboratory examination. The computational stage can be empirical in nature; this is typified by the statistical approach embodied in vaxijen [115] . Or this stage can be bioinformatic; this involves predicting subcellular location and expression levels and the like. Or, this stage can take the form of a complex mathematical model which uses immunoinformatic models combined with mathematical methods, such as metabolic control theory [153] , to predict cell-surface epitope populations It is often difficult to capture the proper scientific meaning and use of recondite terms, often borrowed from common usage or archaic language. So, let us be more specific. An immunogen-a molecular moiety exhibiting the property of immunogenicity-is any material or substance capable of eliciting a specific immune response. An antigen, on the other hand, is a molecular moiety exhibiting the property of antigenicity. It is a substance or material recognised by a primed immune system. Such a persisting state of immune readiness may be mediated by humoral immunity (principally via the action of soluble antibodies) or by cellular immunity (as mediated by T-cells, antigen presenting cells (APCs), or other phagocytic cells), or a combination of both, in what is often referred to as a \"recall\" response.",

This is currently an on-going issue for polio vaccination [14] . Other issues, particularly the chemical or biological contamination of vaccines during manufacture, remain enduring and persistent problems. Undesired immunogenicity, the type leading to severe and pathological immune responses, rather than enduring immune memory, is a concern for both whole-organism and subunitbased vaccines, as well as putative biologics [15] . Immunologists and vaccinologists have thus long sought alternatives to the use of whole organisms as vaccines. Subunit vaccines and conjugate vaccines are one such. Vaccines based on epitopes, singly or in combination, are another. The diversity of innovations in vaccine design holds much potential for success, but, thus far at least, has proved spectacularly unsuccessful in a clinical context.",

Thus, a considerable number of potential, putative, and possible vaccine candidate antigens could be missed by conventional experimental approaches. Reverse vaccinology [16] [17] [18] [19] has the potential to analyse genomes for potential antigens, initially scanning \"open reading frames\" (ORFs), then selecting proteins because they are open to surveillance by the host immune system. This usually involves some complex combination of informatic-based prediction methodologies. Recombinant expression of the resulting set of identified molecules can overcome their reduced natural abundance, which has often prevented us recognising their true potential. By enlarging the repertoire of native antigens, this technology can help to foster the development of a new cohort of vaccines.",

Are high-scoring matches an artefact or are they real and meaningful? The litany of such conditions is all too familiar to anyone well versed in sequence similarity searching. Clearly, when a sequence search is run, using BLAST or FASTA3, for example, an enormously long list of nearly identical proteins might ensue, or one that does not get any hits at all, or almost any intervening result might be obtained. As reflective practitioners, we must judge which result can be classified as useful and which cannot, and in so doing, identify sets of suitable thresholds, above which we expect usefulness and below which we might anticipate little or no utility. Thresholds are contingent upon the sequence family studied, as well as being dependent solely on the problem investigated.

The IEDB database is considerably more extensive than other equivalent database systems, benefiting from the input of 13 dedicated epitope sequencing projects. IEDB has come to eclipse other work in this area. Although both AntiJen and IEDB are full of epitope-focussed information of many flavours, they remain incomplete concerning immunogenic antigens.

This chapter has in its totality been suffused and pervaded by the idea of immunogenicity and the challenge of predicting this property in silico. Such an endeavour is confounding, yet exciting, and, as a key instrument in developing better, safer, more effective vaccines, is also of undisputed practical utility. Successful immunogenicity prediction is at its simplest made manifest through the identification of B cell or T cell epitopes. Epitope recognition, when seen as a chemical event, may be understood in terms of the relationships between apparent biological function or activity and basic physicochemical properties. Delineating structure-activity or property-activity relationships of this kind is a key concern of immunoinformatics. At the other end of the spectrum, immunogenicity can be viewed is a cohesive, integrated, system property: a property of the entire and complete immune system and not a series of individual and isolated molecular recognition events. Thus, the task of predicting systems-level immunogenicity is in all likelihood manifold more demanding than predicting peptide-binding say.",

However, for each such exact prediction, we have some notional associated probability concerning how reliable we regard this result. Different methods evince a range of accuracy, which, in practice, equate to probabilities of reliability: we naturally have more confidence and assume a greater reliability for a highly accurate prediction versus one of average predictability, though it can still give wrong predictions and generally inaccurate predictors may work well for a specific subset of the data.",

Together with endotoxins, such as LPS, and so-called superantigens, exotoxins form the principal varieties of toxin secreted by pathogenic bacteria. Exotoxins have evolved to be the most toxic substances known to science: in terms of the median lethal dose, botulinum toxin-the active ingredient of BOTOX and causative agent of botulism, amongst others-is about ten times as lethal as radioactive isotope polonium-210 and a million times more deadly than mainline poisons, such as arsenic or potassium cyanide. Virtually, all such potent bacterial exotoxins comprise two functionally distinct subunits, either separate proteins or distinct domains, usually denoted A and B. The A subunit is habitually an enzyme, such as a protease, which modifies specific protein targets, thus disrupting key cellular processes with host cells. The B subunit is a protein which binds to host cell surface lipids or proteins, enabling the toxin to be internalised efficiently. The high specificity of this dual action lends exotoxins much of their remarkable lethality.",

To create an expert system, one first needs to analyse human experts and how they make decisions, before translating this into rules that a computer can follow. Such a system leverages both a knowledge base of accumulated expertise and a set of rules for applying such distilled knowledge to particular situations in order to solve problems. Sophisticated expert systems can be updated with new knowledge and rules and can also learn from the success of its prediction, again mirroring the behaviour of properly performing experts.",

Indeed, combining results from multiple prediction tools does often increase overall accuracy.

In part, it is due to the extreme complexity of immune response to an administered vaccine, which is largely specific to each individual or at least is different in different sub-groups within the totality of the vaccinated population. The immune responses is comprised, at least for whole-pathogen vaccines, of the adaptive immune response to multiple B cell and T cell epitopes as well as the responses made by the innate immune responses to diverse molecular structures, principally PAMPs. When one considers also the degree to which such a repertoire of responses is augmented and modified by the action of additives, be they designed to increase the durability and stability of vaccines or be they adjuvants, which are intended to raise the level of immune reactions. Add in stochastic and coincidental phenomena, such as reversion to pathogenicity, and we can see immediately that navigating our way through the vaccine minefield is no easy task. All such problems engendered by this intrinsic complexity are themselves compounded by our comparatively weak understanding of immunological mechanisms, since, if we understood the mechanism of responses well enough, we could and would have designed our vaccines to circumvent these issues.",

A proper understanding of the relationships between gene variants and vaccine-specific immune responses may help us to design the next generation of personalised vaccines. Vaccinomics addresses this issue directly. It seeks to identify genetic factors mediating or moderating vaccine-induced immune responses, which are known to be extremely variable within population. Much data indicate that host genetic polymorphisms are key determinants of innate and adaptive response to vaccination. HLA genes, non-HLA genes, and genes of the innate immunity all contribute, and do so in many ways, to the variation observed between individuals for immune responses to microbial vaccines. Vaccinomics offers many techniques that can help illuminate these diverse phenomena. Principal amongst these are population-based gene/SNP association studies between allele or SNP variation and specific responses, supplemented by the application of next-generation sequencing technology and microarray approaches.",

He identified many of the factors that potentially contribute to the immunogenicity of proteins, be they of pathogen origin or another source entirely, and also other features which might make proteins particularly suitable for becoming candidate vaccines. Of these, some are as-yet beyond prediction, such as the attractiveness for APCs or the inability to down-regulate immune responses. The status of proteins as evasins is currently only possibly addressable through sequence similarity-based approaches and likewise for the attractiveness for uptake by APCs is again, though possible there exist motifs, structural or sequence, which could be identified. Currently, the dearth of relevant data precludes prediction of such properties; and, while it is possible to predict some of these properties with some assurance of success, and others are predictable but only incidentally, overall, we are still some way from realising the dream embodied in Fig. 3 ",
