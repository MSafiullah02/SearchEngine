The cells consisted of recipient predominant macrophages and T cells. The serum cytokine and chemokine profile showed significant elevation of interleukin (IL)21b, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-a, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)21a, and MIP-1b, which declined with the improvement of symptoms after initiation of PSL treatment. A llogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is used to treat hematologic malignant diseases, often providing prolonged survival; however, relapse is the major cause of treatment failure. Withdrawal of immunosuppressive drugs is the usual initial step, and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is performed for intervention of disease reinduction. 1 DLI is also used to convert from mixed to complete donor chimerism for prevention of graft failure or disease relapse. 2 The most significant adverse effect of DLI is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which typically develops 32 to 42 days after infusion in approximately 50% to 60% of patients. [3] [4] [5] Among numerous DLI clinical trials, 3-8 only two reports on pulmonary complications induced by DLI have 9 reported that 9 of 38 patients receiving prophylactic DLI died of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). They speculated that the high rate of fatal IPS may be associated with prior radiation to the chest. In another report, Badros and colleagues 10 found that interstitial pneumonitis developed in two patients after DLI. Neither of these reports included any detailed clinical information, and the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of this pulmonary complication remain unknown.

Rapid engraftment was observed, and chimerism analysis demonstrated that 89% of whole blood cells were donor derived by Day 129 after BMT.

Concurrent lineage-specific chimerism analysis demonstrated that only 10.5% of CD31 cells were donor-derived cells, although 73.5% of CD3-mononuclear cells (MNCs) and more than 95% of granulocytes were donor derived. Based on these findings, tacrolimus was tapered off and then discontinued; however, neither recovery of donor-derived CD31 cells nor GVHD symptoms were observed. Approximately 1 month after discontinuation of the immunosuppressant, DLI (CD31 dose of 4.5 3 10 6 /kg recipient body weight) was performed from the same donor on Day 1193 after allo-BMT. On Day 14 after DLI, the patient complained of spontaneous itchy and dry skin, with eruption on the face suspected to be GVHD. The skin eruption continued until Day 42 without progression and improved without treatment by Day 50. On Day 56, the patient complained of very mild dyspnea with a low-grade fever, which gradually worsened until Day 60. Chest radiography on Day 62 showed diffuse shadows in both lower lung fields. Chest computed tomography (CT) on Day 63 revealed diffuse, bilateral, ground glass opacity and reticular appearance predominantly in the lower lung fields (Fig. 1A) . Pulmonary function tests showed a decline in forced vital capacity, from 3.21 L to 1.98 L, as well as in percentage of vital capacity from 128% to 80% and almost no change (78% to 80%) in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), indicating restrictive lung dysfunction. On Day 78, fiber optic bronchoscopy and a bronchoalveolar lavage were performed. Due to the small sample, histologic findings of the transbronchial lung biopsy only showed trivial alveolar edema without evidence of leukemia infiltration; the specimen did not include bronchiole for differential diagnosis of COP/BOOP or for identification of the BO as chronic GVHD. Analysis of the BALF showed a total cell count of 3.4 3 10 5 cells/mL, with differential cell counts of 36% macrophages, 63% lymphocytes, and 1% granulocytes. Of the lymphocytes, 98% were CD31 T cells, and the CD4/8 ratio was 1.72 (CD4, 62.4%; CD8, 36.3%). Bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures of the BALF were negative. A cytomegalovirus antigenemia test was also negative. The BALF was also shown to be negative for influenza A (including subtypes H1 and H3), influenza B, RSV A and B, HMPV, PIV 1-4, coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus by a respiratory viral panel fast assay (Luminex xTAG, Luminex Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada). Based on these findings, we diagnosed NIPC induced by DLI. On Day 88, prednisolone (PSL) was administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day, which led to rapid clinical improvement.

On the other hand, DLI may induce severe adverse effects, including severe GVHD. When our patient complained of dyspnea with fever, we suspected that the complication was pulmonary GVHD by alloreactive donor T cells recognizing alloantigens. Previous studies have suggested that infused lymphocytes lead to lung injury in murine GVHD models, although the lungs have not been generally considered a classic target organ of acute GVHD. [12] [13] [14] To clarify whether NIPC of the patient was pulmonary GVHD induced by infused donor lymphocytes, we performed chimerism analysis of T cells in the BALF and demonstrated that the cells recruited to the patient's lung were not exclusively derived from donor T cells. These results suggested that the pathogenesis of DLI-induced NIPC was not due to attack by donor-derived cytotoxic T cells directly recognizing the patient's pulmonary tissue, but by migrated patient T cells that were activated after DLI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 98, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 194, "end": 197, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 198, "end": 201, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 202, "end": 205, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 206, "end": 209, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 210, "end": 213, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 825, "end": 829, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 830, "end": 834, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 835, "end": 839, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Analysis of the cytokine profile revealed the kinetics of inflammatory mediators, such as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the serum.
