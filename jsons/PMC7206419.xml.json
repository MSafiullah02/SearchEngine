            "text": "The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic triggered an unprecedented worldwide health-care crisis. It also impacted the world economy and disrupted travel across international borders and within countries. These travel restrictions combined with potentially reduced HCT donor availability (due to infection, quarantine, and constraints on travel to collection centers) and complex allograft processing logistics (donor assessment, collection, on-schedule delivery for fresh infusion) directly impacted the ability to infuse fresh donor-cells into intended recipients on the scheduled day of transplantation. Consequently, the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) [1] and the National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match (NMDP) [2] issued strong recommendations that unrelated donor products should be delivered and cryopreserved at transplant centers before initiation of patient conditioning. NMDP now requires that grafts be delivered and cryopreserved at the transplant center before initiation of transplant-conditioning regimen for any patient intended to undergo unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), in the absence of unique considerations [2]. Many transplant centers also instituted a similar practice for related donor HCT since related donors face many of the same issues as unrelated donors. The use of cryopreserved grafts introduces more flexibility and has occurred sporadically for several decades, although to our knowledge the practice has been ad hoc\n[3]. Several reports examined the effect of transplantation of cryopreserved grafts for hematologic malignancy, including one done very recently by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), in response to the need for information during the COVID-19 pandemic. None showed a difference in survival [4], [5], [6], [7]. To our knowledge, there are no reports of outcomes after transplantation of cryopreserved related or unrelated donor graft for non-malignant hematologic diseases. Thus, the current analysis was undertaken to inform clinical practice for transplantation for severe aplastic anemia, a common non-malignant indication for HCT.",

Other reports have shown an effect of conditioning-regimen for survival after HLA-matched sibling transplants [19]. None of the patients in the current analysis received Cy alone or Cy with Flu, the conditioning regimens that are associated with higher graft failure and mortality rates [19]. The cell dose of the graft has also been associated with graft failure [20]. It is recommended that bone marrow grafts contain a minimum of 3 \u00d7 108/kg TNC to avoid graft failure [20]. These data derive from an analysis of non-cryopreserved bone marrow grafts. Data on infused bone marrow TNC was available for only 70% (23 of 33) cryopreserved and 83% (109 of 132) and non-cryopreserved grafts. Despite this limitation, we observed significantly lower TNC infused after cryopreservation of bone marrow grafts. Although 68% of patients receiving cryopreserved bone marrow grafts had \u22653 \u00d7 108/kg TNC harvested, only 26% had that number infused. This loss of cells may have resulted in the observed differences in outcomes. The difference between TNC at harvest and infusion implies cryopreservation/thaw process is associated with cell loss. However, there may be other unmeasured or unknown factors that also resulted in the observed differences in outcome. We do not have data on cell function at any time point. An earlier report on the functional assay of cryopreserved bone marrow suggests preservation of cell function although that report included only 7 grafts [21]. An analysis of non-cryopreserved bone marrow cellular subsets for unrelated donor transplantations failed to show an effect of graft composition on hematopoietic recovery or survival although that report included only 7 patients with aplastic anemia [22].",

A subset analysis limited to recipients of peripheral blood was consistent with the findings of the main analysis. Cryopreserved CD34+ cells from peripheral blood are reported to have significant loss of membrane integrity, viability, and CFU potential that collectively could contribute to the adverse effect of transplantation of cryopreserved peripheral blood in our study [23]. We hypothesize that several factors led to the poor outcomes after transplantation of cryopreserved grafts. Optimizing cell dose is desirable but a controlled study that examines for changes in graft composition with cryopreservation/thaw that is specific for aplastic anemia is needed. A detailed analysis of the composition and function of cryopreserved grafts is beyond the scope of this study. We did not observe statistically significant differences in neutrophil and platelet recovery despite lower rates of recovery after transplantation of cryopreserved grafts. We hypothesize the absence of significant differences is attributed the modest number of patients in the current analysis. We do not know the indication for using a cryopreserved graft for the patients included in this analysis. The data on the interval between diagnosis and transplant was not different between the treatment groups. Further, the timing of transplantation by donor type is also consistent with accepted clinical practice guidelines. HLA-matched sibling transplants were mostly offered within 6 months from diagnosis and alternative donor transplants later after failure of at least one course of immunosuppressive therapy [24]. Recipients of cryopreserved and non-cryopreserved grafts were matched for graft type (bone marrow or peripheral blood). Subset analyses limited to peripheral blood transplants confirmed higher graft failure and mortality consistent with the main analysis and suggest a greater effect than with bone marrow grafts.",
