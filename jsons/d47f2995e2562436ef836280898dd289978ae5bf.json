Rapid antigen tests are commonly used in many hospital laboratories, emergency departments, and doctors' offices. Most influenza rapid antigen tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays in which patient samples are applied to a chromatographic strip that contains monoclonal antibodies against influenza A and B viruses. On-site diagnosis of influenza by point-of-care tests has been shown to limit antibiotic prescriptions, use of blood cultures, and chest radiography and ultimately to reduce patient costs [7] . However, rapid antigen tests have demonstrated a wide range of sensitivities for detection of seasonal influenza viruses, ranging from 69%-96% for the BD Directigen EZ Flu A+B test [8, 9] , 64.9%-73% for the BinaxNOW Influenza A&B test [8, 10] , and 19.7%-85% for the QuickVue Influenza A+B Test [11, 12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1907, "end": 1910, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2097, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2100, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2152, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2153, "end": 2156, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2209, "end": 2213, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2214, "end": 2217, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 122, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1357, "end": 1366, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "We found that the 3 rapid antigen tests had low to modest sensitivities for diagnosis of pandemic influenza A/H1N1, although all tests demonstrated excellent specificity, with no cross-reactivity against other cocirculating respiratory viruses. Possible reasons for the low sensitivities in our study include the fact that the sample collection technique was not standardized and that specimens were refrigerated and only tested after completion of RT-PCR, which may have led to antigen degradation. However, we think that this is unlikely, because our findings are consistent with those of a similar study by Ginocchio et al [6] in which rapid antigen tests had a sensitivity of only 17.8% for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus, compared with the Luminex xTAG RVP. An alternative explanation may be related to differences in test sensitivity for detection of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus, compared with seasonal influenza viruses. In a study that used titered pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus grown in cell cultures, rapid antigen tests required 1-1.5-log higher viral loads than did human seasonal virus for a positive result [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 626, "end": 629, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1132, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Other limitations of our study include the fact that we employed a known convenience sample of positive specimens. Because of the widespread interest regarding the clinical performance of rapid antigen tests for detection of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus, we used a convenience sample of positive specimens to allow for a quick yet relatively accurate assessment of these tests. In addition, all specimens were decoded, and both investigators performing the tests were blinded to the RT-PCR results. Finally, because the design of our study did not permit an accurate determination of the NPV and PPV, we calculated these values on the basis of the prevalence of novel influenza H1N1 during the study period. These values would clearly vary according to the prevalence of disease, and the PPV would be highest during the peak of an outbreak, with increased numbers of false-positive results when disease prevalence is low (Table 1).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Despite modest sensitivities, rapid influenza antigen testing could prove to be useful because of the tests' speed, portability, and ease of performance. Clinicians should be aware that patients presenting with an influenza-like illness and a negative rapid antigen test result should undergo further laboratory testing. However, a positive rapid antigen test result would allow presumptive diagnosis of novel influenza H1N1 virus infection and should lead to timely institution of infection control measures, treatment, and prophylaxis. Finally, as we approach the 2009-2010 winter season, it is desirable for manufacturers to develop sensitive rapid antigen kits that can also differentiate seasonal influenza A viruses from pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus in view of their different antiviral susceptibilities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Novel Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Investigation Team.
