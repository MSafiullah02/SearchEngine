Currently, NIV is frequently started outside the intensive care unit (ICU)-not only in the emergency department but also in general wards with less-extensive monitoring facilities [ 2 , 3 ] . Plant et al. [ 4 ] showed that it is possible to apply NIV to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (ARF) in the general ward provided the respiratory failure is not severe (assessed by pH > 7.30). A European survey of a European Respiratory Society Task Force [ 5 ] defi ned the ICU as a location with a high staff-to-patients ratio and facilities for performing invasive ventilation and monitoring. It defi ned a respiratory intermediate ICU (RIICU), or a high-dependency unit, as a specifi c clinical area that has the capability of performing continuous vital sign monitoring and a staff-to-patient ratio somewhere between those for an ICU and a general ward (usually 1:4). Clinical criteria for performing NIV in an RIICU are based on mental status and the presence (or absence) of multi-organ failure [ 1 ] .",

The use of NIV is associated with lower rates of nosocomial infection, so its use should be encouraged whenever appropriate [ 6 ] . Nevertheless, a document endorsed by the European Respiratory Society and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine stated that NIV should not be considered an alternative to ETI for ARF secondary to infection with the H1N1 virus that is worsening to become acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [ 7 ] . According to this document, however, NIV can be considered to prevent further deterioration and avoid the need for ETI in patients with mild to moderate hypercapnic or hypoxemic ARF and/or distress due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema in the absence of pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and/or refractory hypoxemia. It can be also used to prevent postextubation respiratory failure in patients with improving ARDS secondary to H1N1 infection, preferentially when the patient is no longer contaminated. These warnings are even more important when considering the potential use of NIV for ARF due to high-risk infections outside the ICU.",

In these cases, minimum monitoring includes regular assessment of the respiratory, hemodynamic, and neurological functions by adequately trained personnel 24 h a day [ 4 ] . In contrast, severely hypoxemic ARF should be treated at least in an RIICU, where monitoring and prompt ETI are available, thereby avoiding dangerous delays to appropriate treatment.

They showed a lower infection rate for patients on acute NIV compared to those on invasive or conventional ventilation [ 8 ] . Risk factors for these patients on NIV include the ventilator, humidifi er, and their circuits. Specifi cally designed NIV ventilators are used on general wards and in RIICUs. They often have only one tube from the ventilator to the patient, with an exhalation valve to the external environment. On the one hand this design means a lower risk of ventilator contamination because there is no airfl ow from the patient back into the ventilator. On the other hand, there is an increased risk of environmental and caregiver airborne contamination. Studies have confi rmed that nurses and physicians providing NIV and chest physiotherapy, working in contact with an infected patient, should have a higher level of respiratory protection [ 9 ] . Reports have demonstrated that the use of various facial masks for NIV is associated with substantial exposure to exhaled air leaking within 1 m from the patient. This risk varies according to the type of mask and is greater with increasing leakage and with higher inspiratory pressures [ 10 ] .",
