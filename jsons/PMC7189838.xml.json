Reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of respiratory specimens represents the gold standard for identifying patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as asymptomatic carriers. Its timely development allowed containment of the pandemic in many countries. Successful future management of the disease\u2019s spread will require the serological detection of past infection to determine immunity [3]. Especially in healthcare workers, this is of outmost importance to identify immune personnel that will treat vulnerable patient groups and for the planning and management of infection preventive measures. It also allows the identification of plasma donors for therapeutic interventions.",
