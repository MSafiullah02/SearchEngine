Culture and colony counting is the oldest bacterial analysis technique and continues to be a standard method that provides unambiguous results [1]. However, culturing often requires up to several days depending on the microbe type thus making other techniques necessary. Molecular identification approaches are primarily based on the detection of specific nucleotide sequences within the pathogen genome or the detection of pathogen-specific protein molecules or epitopes on the cell surface using antibodies. The most widely used methods are based on various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) formats or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Even though both these solution-based approaches can be highly specific and sensitive, especially PCR, they often require the time-consuming extraction and purification of nucleic acids or antigens from samples. Other issues include contamination control and discriminating false positive and negative results. In addition, these assays are label-dependent involving the use of reporter molecules conjugated to either an enzyme or fluorescent probe as well as having very limited capabilities for the simultaneous investigation of multiple targets in a single sample aliquot.",

While initial approaches were typically limited to identifying single pathogens, there is an increasing demand for multiplexed detection. DNA microarrays have emerged as a key high throughput technology for bacterial and viral typing and detection where hundreds to thousands of individual DNA sequences can be compared in a single experiment. Such analyses first involve the successful extraction and PCR amplification of cleaned-up samples which typically restricts their use to within the laboratory. The utilization of DNA microarrays and fluorescence imaging for pathogen analysis have been nicely reviewed elsewhere and are not discussed further [2].",

The surface immobilization of antibodies (and proteins in general) in a stable, high-density and reproducible manner without subsequent loss of bioactivity has proven to be significantly more challenging than that for DNA. However, a variety of chemistries have been developed in recent years allowing immobilization onto a wide range of sensor surfaces (e.g. glass, silicon, gold, plastic microwells, hydrogels, etc.) [3]. Surface attachment can occur via physiosorption onto polymer coated surfaces as well as covalent coupling through a cross linker via thiol, maleimide or amino groups and using affinity binding such as biotin/streptavidin [4]. Another issue is the considerable effort required to obtain antibodies that are highly specific towards a single target. A large number of protein and carbohydrate binding sites (epitopes) are common to various different species [5]. The rational production of antibodies involves first identifying pathogen-specific surface proteins. These are then cloned and expressed in order to be used as antigens for antibody production. This involves a great deal of work and consequently many proof-of-principle demonstrations of new sensing technologies focus on a relatively small number of antibody\u2013pathogen interactions.",

Particularly promising are nucleic acid aptamers, which are short, single-stranded RNA or DNA sequences (\u223c20\u201330 bases long) that selectively bind to non-nucleic targets such as proteins as well as a large variety of other targets that include toxins, cells and tissues. Binding occurs via interaction of the target with particular 3-D loop structures formed by the nucleic acids. Aptamers are typically selected from large libraries using a reiterative selection and amplification process known as SELEX [6]. This process combined with well-established methods for creating nucleic acids, their robustness and the opportunity to introduce additional chemical functionalities offer several advantages over antibodies. Consequently, a growing number of aptamers targeting specific pathogens have started to emerge in recent years [7]. In another example, Sreevatsan and co-workers utilized DNA aptamers specific to Salmonella enteric serovars in PCR-based detection [8].",

            "text": "One of the most consistent challenges in performing quantitative biosensing is the requirement of a label to enable signal generation. This can involve directly attaching the label to the target pathogen itself or to a secondary or even tertiary recognition element. In a sandwich assay (see Fig. 2a), immobilized antibodies capture the unlabeled target followed by the binding of a second fluorescently labeled antibody specific to a different site on the pathogen [9], [10], [11], [12]. Recent examples include prototype fluorescence sensors that can measure intrinsic cellular fluorescence focusing on bacterial cells using hemin (ferriprotoporphyrin IX) tethered on a disposable chip [13], fluorescence array sensors utilizing the evanescent wave for excitation of fluorescently tagged reporters in pathogen detection [14] as well as miniaturized real-time total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) array biosensors using planar waveguides created on different surfaces (glass, silica and polystyrene) [15]. Fluorescence-based analysis remains one of the most popular detection methodologies, however issues such as the additional expense of labeling, dye photobleaching and instrumentation costs have driven the emergence of alternative label-free methods. In particular, techniques with the potential for achieving the necessary sensitivity as well as being low-cost and portable are of especial interest to researchers developing new pathogen detection methods.",

            "text": "SPR is currently the leading technology for label-free pathogen detection. As shown in Fig. 2b, a low power light source is coupled to the interface of a thin gold film via total internal reflection where propagating surface plasmon modes are excited depending on the photon frequency and incidence angle. The plasmon resonance is highly sensitive to local changes in refractive index within the evanescent field at the gold/sample solution interface and thus does not require the use of a label. When pathogens specifically bind to antibodies immobilized onto the gold surface, changes in the intensity of light reflected off the surface are measured by the detector. The popularity of SPR is indicated by the growing number of companies offering either lab-based or portable SPR instrumentation such as GE Healthcare, IBIS Technologies, GWC Technologies and KMAC. Currently, most measurements are still restricted to one or two pathogen species per sample surface although larger array-type measurements have been performed for nucleic acid and proteomic studies [16]. Typically between one and eight flow channels are used to deliver samples and controls to the surface and the associated signal changes compared. For example, Irudayaraj and co-workers utilized SPR immunosensors for the detection of various pathogens in conjunction with the modulation of sensor surface using a mixed monolayer of polyethylene glycol (PEG) terminated alkane thiols [17], [18]. Homola and co-workers reported an eight-channel SPR sensor based on wavelength division multiplexing for the simultaneous detection of four foodborne pathogens using target specific antibodies [19]. Another recent example is the highly sensitive and selective SPR detection of Bacillus\nanthracis in the presence of other related Bacillus spores via the use of a mouse monoclonal antibody designated 8G3 raised against the target spores [20].",

            "text": "An alternative label-free approach to pathogen detection is the use of a quartz crystal resonator sandwiched between two thin gold electrodes (see Fig. 2c) which can be used in a liquid environment for biosensing. The quartz crystal oscillates at a particular resonance frequency and when a change in mass occurs such as due to adsorption of molecules onto the gold surface, the frequency decreases. Changes in oscillation damping can also be used to provide structural information about the thin molecular layers formed. Although QC resonators have been used for many years to control the vapor-phase growth of thin films it is only more recently that this technology has emerged as a competitor to SPR with companies such as Qsense and KSV Instruments providing products targeted at the biosensing market. Immunoassays can be created by immobilizing antibodies onto the gold surface however, unlike for SPR, measurements are restricted to a single target per electrode surface. In an early example, Guilbault and co-workers developed a QCM sensor for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes [25], [26]. Wong et al. were able to detect low levels of salmonella as well as distinguish between different strains [27]. Here, the gold electrode layer was replaced with silver which was coated with a polyethylenimine (PEI) layer and crosslinked via glutaraldehyde which could be activated prior to the immobilization of antibodies. The use of a PEI polymer layer for antibody immobilization on a gold electrode has also been applied to detect rapidly the dengue virus from blood samples with a 100-fold better sensitivity than previous methods [28].",

As in the case of SPR, measurements are based on changes in refractive index within an evanescent field region, however the design of the waveguide structure can vary greatly. One approach becoming prominent for biosensing, including pathogen detection, is the resonant mirror design supporting different resonant angles for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes [29], [30], [31]. For example, Pazos et al. utilized a resonant mirror biosensor for the detection of yessotoxin (YTX) by measuring the changes in the refractive index occurring when the YTX interacted with the ligand, phosphodiesterase, immobilized on glutaraldehyde activated aminosaline surface [31]. Another design example is the metal clad leaky waveguide (MCLW) which has a much longer penetration depth into the sample medium above the detector surface than the resonant mirror. In conjunction with a disposable absorbing cladding material, the LW biosensor could be employed to detect Bacillus subtilis var. niger (BG) bacterial spores at 104\n spores/mL as well as the sensing surface could be tailored to give a maximum extension of the evanescent field greater than the size of the bacteria captured by surface immobilized antibodies [32].",

It is based on a very sharp probe tip, only a few nanometers thick, mounted on the end of a cantilever (see Fig. 2e). When brought close to a surface a number of different forces can interact with the tip and are measured using a laser spot reflected from the top surface of the cantilever. Both quantitative and qualitative detection and characterization of pathogens adsorbed onto a surface has been achieved using tapping mode AFM which minimizes lateral or dragging force applied by the tip. A description of the different materials (typically glass, mica and silanized silica) along with various surface chemistries for imaging the surface ultrastructure of various pathogens in real time has been nicely reviewed elsewhere [34]. Prominent examples include single virus particles such as the herpes simplex virus-1 and wild-type moloney murine leukemia, membrane proteins, and the rapid visualization of capsid and DNA deposited on a mica surface using extra oxide-sharpened silicon nitride nanotips in tapping mode [35], [36]. Though there are still some sensing limitations associated with mechanical complexity, tip contamination, slow scan speed and instrument size, prominent developments and modifications addressing these issues are underway ensuring AFM will feature among the next generation of biosensing platforms.",

Among the various types of interferometers, Mach-Zehnder, Young's, Hartman and backscattering configurations have been utilized for the detection of biomolecules including pathogens [37], [38], [39]. Ghadiri and co-workers demonstrated an approach utilizing biofunctionalized thin films of porous silicon to detect small molecular targets including 16-nucleotide DNA oligomers and proteins at concentrations in the picomolar to femtomolar range [40]. Also, in a novel approach based on a Young interferometer, Kanger and co-workers designed a chip consisting of four parallel channel waveguides connected at one end via a common light entry point [41]. The light emitted from the four channels at the opposite end results in an interference pattern which is sensitive to refractive index changes in any one of the channels. A detection limit of 850 particles/mL was reported for the herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-1 where one of the channel surfaces was coated with a specific antibody against HSV with the technique easily adaptable to other targets.",

Different viral strains were characterized by differences in the relative intensities of peaks in the spectra due to unique pathogen surface proteins binding on the SERS substrate (see Fig. 4B). As a result, a reference library of fingerprints could be established for various viruses and strains.",

Here, the coupling of the optical properties of both planar surface plasmons generated on gold diffraction gratings and adsorbed gold nanoparticle bioconjugates are employed (see Fig. 5\n). In a first demonstration, locked nucleic acid probe molecules were immobilized on the grating to which target microRNA sequences were first hybridized followed by a polymerase A reaction to create the surface poly A tails on the grating surface. When polythymine coated gold nanoparticles specifically hybridized to the polyadenosine tail, the diffraction efficiency was measured at the first order spot, which proportionally increased as a function of the target concentration. The NEDG sensors initially demonstrated the detection of microRNA and DNA at concentrations as low as 10 fM ranges [43], [49]. We envision that NEDG sensors possess hold significant potential for a wide range of applications including the highly sensitive detection of pathogens as well as other biological molecules.",

For example, electrochemical immunoassays using interdigitated nanostructured silicon transducers have been demonstrated for the rapid discrimination of live pathogens versus harmless dead ones [50]. This was achieved using a pair of interdigitated polycrystalline silicon electrodes whose surface was coated by thin layer of native silicon oxide upon which antibody probes were immobilized. Impedance spectra were measured at a high frequency range along with changes in the capacitance caused by the interaction of the live bacteria with supporting AFM measurements used to image bacterial cells. In another example, lithographically fabricated silicon nanowire transistors featuring 50 nm polysilicon nanowires connected with gold electrodes spaced 150 nm apart and a 200\u2013500 nm polyimide insulating layer (see Fig. 6a) have been developed for the ultra-sensitive detection of the bacterial toxin, staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), at femtomolar concentrations [51]. As shown in Fig. 6, the charge transfer resistances associated with the mass transfer of SEB complexed with the anti-SEB on the nanowire electrode proportionally increased with the SEB concentration. The In2O3 nanowire FETs sensing platform was further developed for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus by means of measuring the interaction of a biomarker associated with the SARS corona virus with the antibody mimic proteins immobilized on the nanowire surface [52].",

The peptide nanotubes were functionalized with antibodies at their ends and fluorescent signaling units on their sidewalls. When viral pathogens were mixed with these antibody-coated nanotubes, the nanotubes rapidly aggregated around the viruses to form a networked structure. The size of the aggregates increased with the concentration of viruses and detected via flow cytometry by measuring forward light scattering intensity and fluorescence intensity of aggregated dye-loaded antibody nanotubes around viruses.",

The \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d concept involving a fully integrated system offers several advantages such as requiring very small amounts of sample, high precision, shortened analysis times and good reproducibility. With respect to pathogen detection most recent advances in this area have focused on the challenge of incorporating conventional PCR based technologies [55]; for example, an integrated PCR\u2013capillary electrophoresis chip [56]. One highlight is the combined use of the optothermal properties of gold nanorods in a microfluidic chip device along with a one-step real-time PCR system [57]. The longitudinal resonance of gold nanorods was used to transform near infrared energy into thermal energy resulting in effective on-chip pathogen lysis. The DNA extracted out of the E. coli BL21 cell body was transferred to a real-time PCR chamber for amplified detection without additional sample processing. Another interesting approach worth mentioning is the design of a complete integrated chip-based system (see Fig. 7a) for the ultra-sensitive detection of avian influenza virus H5N1 [58]. The sample viral RNA is first isolated, purified and preconcentrated using silica-coated superparamagnetic particles before undergoing RT-PCR on a miniaturized thermocycler. As depicted in Fig. 7b, each step was performed in droplets on a Teflon coated disc manipulated under a controlled magnetic field. In particular, PCR was achieved within 30 min by moving the droplet clockwise over different temperature zones which was monitored in real time with fluorescence-based detection utilizing an integrated optical system. In addition to on-chip PCR devices, microchannels filled with a photopolymerized crosslinked polyacrylamide gel were developed to achieve improved electrophoretic separation of the antibody\u2013analyte complex from excess antibody. The ratio of bound versus unbound immune-complexes in the microchannel was then measured by laser-induced fluorescence. The rapid detection of SEB, shiga toxin I and ricin at picomolar concentrations using minimal sample volumes (<10 \u03bcL) was achieved in 20 min [59].",

The ideal technique will be able to simultaneously monitor multiple targets directly in complex environments with minimum or no prior sample preparation and have a large measurement dynamic range from subfemtomolar to nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, new sensing technologies should be capable of not only detecting the presence of a particular pathogen but also assessing its bioactivity to determine whether the pathogen is in an active state. This requires continual advances in both the design and availability of biomolecular probes specific to a wide range of targets along with improvements in surface chemistries which eliminate issues such as non-specific adsorption irrespective of sample type or complexity. Due to the continual demand for improved pathogen sensing, this field will remain at the forefront of development as one of the first applications with which to assess the performance of next generation sensors.
