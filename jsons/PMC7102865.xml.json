Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1864 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases with 659 associated deaths in 27 countries since September 2012 [2]. According to the last WHO report, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) remains the most afflicted country, with remarkable morbidity and mortality rates [3]. The first case of coronavirus infection was identified in the KSA in June 2012 [4]. Subsequently, continuous detection of the virus has been reported in different healthcare facilities in the KSA and other Asian countries, including Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Iran [5], [6], [7], [8]. Most of the reported cases have emerged from the Middle East; other cases reported elsewhere had direct connections with primary cases of infection in the Middle East [9]. Therefore, many countries worldwide have implemented prevention measures, particularly amongst potential travelers to Middle Eastern countries. The KSA is a particular concern since it is the epicenter of the disease and a destination for millions seeking the Haj pilgrimage or Umrah annually.",

This information is urgently needed for the planning and effective implementation of preventive and control measures to combat dissemination of the virus within and outside of the Middle Eastern region. Despite the strong link between the transmission patterns of the disease and both zoonotic transfers and human-to-human transmission [12], data on the risk and contributing factors to the rapid spread and health effects of the virus are lacking, particularly in hospitalized patients from the KSA [8]. Significant questions remain unanswered on the extent of the Saudi people's awareness of the characteristics and nature of this virus. Finding answers to these questions is instrumental for the implementation of effective preventive measures to reduce and control the frequent occurrence of MERS-CoV outbreaks. Increased public awareness of the disease may decrease the risk of the virus and help combat the disease in the annual mass-gathering events that occur in the KSA, such as the Hajj and Umrah. This study aimed to identify the gap in knowledge of the adult population residing in Riyadh, KSA, toward the nature and transmission modes of MERS-CoV infection.",

The epidemiological domain questions were related to knowledge of the nature of the causative agent, modes of transmission (droplets, contact, and animal to man or other transmission), incubation period and availability of vaccines. The clinical domain measured knowledge of the clinical signs and symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath, pharyngitis, diarrhea, no symptoms, death and other consequences) and questions inquiring about the availability of a cure for the disease. To evaluate the responses to these questions, a correct answer was allocated a value of one, and a wrong answer was allocated a value of zero.

Approximately 66% of the study participants had overall good knowledge regarding MERS-CoV (66.4%). This frequency is comparable to the reported knowledge score from a study conducted in Al Qaseem (73.2%) but higher than the knowledge score reported in a study conducted in Makah (32.4%) [15], [16]. However, these two studies enrolled only healthcare workers and had different sample sizes and respondent characteristics. More nurses were included in the study from Makah than in the study from Qaseem. Our study went further to explore the gap in knowledge among the general population regarding the characteristics of the disease and to determine related factors. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively assess the necessary and required epidemiological and clinical knowledge aspects of the disease. The study highlights gaps in knowledge and the essential elements required to educate and encourage the Saudi public to play active roles in the prevention and treatment of the disease and possibly reverse the course of this rapidly growing, highly infectious and fatal disease. Additionally, our study adopted a unique approach of separately evaluating the epidemiological and clinical knowledge domains, which typically are combined together in similar studies. Combined assessment of these two domains might overstate the overall knowledge score and obscure the identification of areas with a significant lack of knowledge. Reliance mostly on the clinical manifestations of these types of diseases to assess public knowledge might produce biased results. Our approach allowed us to glean information concerning these areas and identify inadequate epidemiological knowledge and skills that need urgent educational interventions. This approach could be useful for similar studies evaluating public knowledge toward infectious diseases other than Mers-Cov, such SARS, H1N1, Zika, and Ebola.",

Alarmingly, the previous study found that the individuals who underestimated the fatality rate of MERS-CoV disease received their information from the Internet [24]. This finding may suggest that the quality of information currently available through the Internet is inadequate and in need of revision. Moreover, a very low percentage of participants indicated that their main source of information was healthcare providers. This scenario reflects a lack of engagement of healthcare workers in increasing awareness of the public regarding the different aspects of MERS-CoV.
