Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial for patients of all ages, especially those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease or compromised immune systems (Glezen et al., 2000, Weinberg et al., 2004). Early detection of respiratory virus infections allows clinicians to initiate immediate therapeutic interventions that can reduce complications, antibiotic use, and unnecessary laboratory testing (Adcock et al., 1997, Jernigan et al., 2011, Mahony et al., 2009, Renaud et al., 2012).",

While these conventional assays are still considered to be the reference methods for respiratory virus detection, they are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and inferior to nucleic acid amplification tests (in both sensitivity and specificity) (Falsey et al., 2006, Vallieres and Renaud, 2013, Zhang et al., 2012). By screening for a variety of pathogens at the same time, nucleic acid-based multiplex assays are able to simultaneously detect a panel of viruses and shorten the hands-on time (HOT), turnaround time (TAT), and length of hospital stay compared to those of traditional methods (Boivin et al., 2004, Cho et al., 2013, Gharabaghi et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2013, Renaud et al., 2012).",

Previous studies evaluated the performance of the Seeplex assay and determined that it can save time and resources compared to conventional methods (Bibby et al., 2011, Drews et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2009, Weinberg et al., 2004, Yoo et al., 2007). Recently, the AdvanSure\u2122 RV real-time PCR kit (AdvanSure; LG Life Sciences, Korea) has been introduced. This kit is comprised of five reaction tubes (Rheem et al., 2012) and can detect 14 different RVs: human coronavirus (CoV) 229E, CoV NL63, CoV OC43, parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, PIV 2, PIV 3, influenza viruses (INF) type A and B, human respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) type A and B, human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human adenovirus (ADV) and human bocavirus (BoV). This profile is similar to that of the Seeplex assay but also includes BoV and can distinguish between CoV 229E and CoV NL63.",

On the contrary, the AdvanSure assay targets the human RNP gene as an internal control and quantifies it in each sample, which enables monitoring of the RNA extraction and the reverse transcription steps along with the specimen quality (Cho et al., 2013, Dreier et al., 2005). Monitoring the specimen quality by using an endogenous internal control is important because it could prevent misjudgment from sampling error.

The AdvanSure assay is a one-step real-time PCR assay in which the reverse transcription and multiplex PCR steps are both conducted in the same reaction well. The advantages of the one-step assay over the two-step assay include improved workflow, reduction in assay preparation time, and elimination of cross contamination from the transfer of cDNA from the reverse transcription reaction into the PCR reaction. These factors can play a role in improving the workflow speed for the AdvanSure assay. In our study, TAT and HOT were calculated on the condition that we perform both AdvanSure and Seeplex assays with 16 clinical samples (80 reactions for AdvanSure assay) in one batch. The AdvanSure assay, which is comprised of five reaction tubes, has definitive strengths in workload when compared with the Seeplex assay comprised of two reaction tubes. However, by reducing the number of reaction tubes to four in the AdvanSure assay, it would be possible to lessen the workload as well as facilitate medium to high throughput workloads more effectively.",
