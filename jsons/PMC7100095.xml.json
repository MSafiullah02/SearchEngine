An infection is suspected if fever occurs together with purulent sputum and leukocytosis. However, several noninfectious causes can mimic pneumonia and should be ruled out: atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), adverse drug reactions, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary fibrosis, lung carcinoma and congestive heart failure (pulmonary edema). Consequently, in only one-third of all ICU patients with pulmonary infiltrate is pneumonia thought to be the underlying etiology.[9,10] On the other hand, the absence of pulmonary infiltrates on the chest radiograph does not exclude pneumonia.[11] The clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) can be helpful in supporting the clinician in identifying patients with HAP. The score is calculated from temperature readings, leukocyte counts, purulence of tracheal secretions, oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood [PaO2]/fraction of inspired oxygen [FIO2] ratio), aspects of pulmonary radiography, progression of pulmonary infiltrate, and quantitative culture of tracheal aspirate (see also section 3.2 and section 4).",

Especially in critically ill patients or patients on mechanical ventilation, once microaspiration has occurred, secretions are insufficiently eliminated from the lower respiratory tract, which can lead to the development of pneumonia.[19] As a result, it can be very difficult to differentiate colonizing pathogens in respiratory specimens from pathogens that are involved in active invasive infection.",

Culture and Gram stain examination of expectorated sputum from patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can identify the etiologic pathogen with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. Most bacterial pathogens of CAP are easily differentiated from the normal oropharyngeal flora that inevitably is found in most cultures of expectorated sputum. In contrast, culture of expectorated sputum from hospitalized patients suspected of having bacterial HAP is frequently contaminated by colonizing microorganisms of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Although colonization of the upper respiratory tract by enteric Gram-negative bacteria is recognized as a risk factor for developing HAP,[20\u201323] a positive sputum culture does not differentiate between colonization and the etiologic pathogen of HAP in any given patient. In non-intubated and non-critically ill patients a sputum culture can, at most, identify suspected pathogens and their resistance pattern, but lacks sensitivity and specificity to identify the etiologic microorganism of HAP. Since colonization of the upper respiratory tract is most frequently found in critically ill or intubated patients, and because HAP in these groups is a life-threatening infection, a more reliable diagnostic sampling is needed in these patients.",

Although consensus about which technique can be best employed to diagnose VAP is lacking, both protected specimen brush (PSB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in combination with quantitative culture have shown good results in diagnosing VAP.[24] Although most studies using invasive techniques in diagnosing HAP do so in patients suspected of VAP, bronchoscopic techniques may also play a crucial role in adapting antimicrobial therapy in non-mechanically ventilated patients suspected of HAP.[25] ",

A major advantage is that these techniques can be employed by non-bronchoscopists and are less expensive. However, a major disadvantage of these techniques is the potential sampling error as a result of the blind technique without airway visualization. When using endotracheal aspirates, mere tracheal colonization is differentiated from positive cultures resulting from pneumonia by means of a certain cut-off value of the number of microorganisms per volume. However, if a cut-off of 106 cfu/mL is used many patients may not be identified (false-negative sampling).[37] On the other hand, diagnosing HAP with a lower cut-off value would result in unnecessary treatment of patients without HAP (false positives). Similarly, during non-bronchoscopic BAL or PSB the catheter is inserted blindly into the respiratory tract with the risk that microbiologic samples are obtained from unaffected segments of the lung, yielding false-negative cultures in patients with HAP.[38] ",

The fifth day is taken as the \u2018cut-off\u2019 because most HAPs occurring before that time are caused by one of the core pathogens.[4,52] ",

However, most studies were performed in patients admitted to an ICU and on mechanical ventilation. In an ICU study by George et al.[18] of 28 patients with VAP, late-onset VAP was defined as pneumonia developing after >5 days of mechanical ventilation. S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus spp. predominated in early-onset VAP and Pseudomonas spp. and MRSA in late-onset VAP. MRSA was only found in late-onset cases of VAP. However, prior use of antibacterials can lead to selection of resistant strains. This was not corrected for and may have influenced the outcome of this study. In another prospective study of 135 episodes of VAP, the use of broad-spectrum antibacterials prior to developing VAP was corrected for; results indicated that drug-resistant bacteria were independently associated with the duration of mechanical ventilation.[53] Multiresistant bacteria (non-fermenting enteric Gram-negative bacteria and/or MRSA) were not found before day 7 of mechanical ventilation. In a study by Rello et al.,[49] 9 of 89 episodes of VAP occurring before day 7 of mechanical ventilation were caused by multiresistant bacteria. However, P. aeruginosa was found in three patients, all experiencing COPD. COPD is a known risk factor for VAP with P. aeruginosa. Therefore, empirical therapy for patients with COPD should include anti-pseudomonal coverage, especially in patients with a long-term history of COPD with recurrent use of antibacterials. The other six episodes of VAP were caused by Acinetobacter baumannii. These cases were all found in two specific hospitals with a high prevalence of these bacteria. Again, this emphasizes that each hospital should be aware of local epidemiology of multiresistant bacteria. In hospitals with a high prevalence, empirical therapy should be adapted accordingly, especially in patients with severe HAP and those at increased risk of resistant bacteria.",

P. aeruginosa was the only pathogen found significantly more frequently in patients with late-onset HAP compared with early-onset HAP. However, P. aeruginosa was isolated from patients with early-onset HAP in greater numbers than expected and differences between both groups were small: 25% and 38% in early- and late-onset HAP, respectively. P. aeruginosa was found more frequently in patients with early-onset HAP than would be expected based on the ATS statement. The authors discussed whether anti-pseudomonal coverage should also be considered in some cases. However, this study defined the onset in relation to time of ICU admission (early-onset HAP was pneumonia occurring within the first 96 hours of ICU admission), in contrast to the ATS, which defined the onset in relation to the time of hospital admission.[54] In this study more than 50% of early-onset HAP was caused by P. aeruginosa, MRSA, S. maltophilia, Enterobacter spp. and Acinetobacter spp. The high incidence of multiresistant bacteria was because of hospitalization prior to ICU admission. These studies demonstrate that the definition of early- and late-onset HAP should not be based exclusively on time of admission to an ICU. Since colonization of the respiratory tract commences at admission to the hospital, this also defines the time of onset. Although mechanical ventilation is a risk factor for the development of HAP, it also seems to enhance the colonization process of resistant pathogens.[55] Therefore, the time a patient has been on mechanical ventilation should also be taken in account when assessing the risk for HAP with resistant microorganisms.",

Moreover, not only the presence or absence of antibacterial therapy before the onset of pneumonia, but also the specific use of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents such as third-generation cephalosporins, imipenem, or fluoroquinolones, was independently related to antimicrobial resistance of VAP. Moreover, in 2002 Trouillet et al.[61] demonstrated by multivariate analysis that not only was the occurrence of P. aeruginosa linked to previous antibacterial use, but that the occurrence of piperacillin-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa could also be linked to prior antibacterial use, especially that of fluoroquinolone. Since piperacillin is a major empirical antipseudomonal drug, in patients having received fluoroquinolones prior to the development of HAP, empirical therapy for HAP with risk factors should not include piperacillin.[61] Moreover, after having received fluoroquinolones prior to the onset of HAP, these antibacterials should also be avoided in empirical therapy since the existence of fluoroquinolone-resistant P. aeruginosa is to be expected.",

S. maltophilia has recently emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen in immunocompromised cancer patients and transplant recipients. Risk analysis has shown that mechanically ventilated ICU patients receiving antibacterials, especially carbapenems, are at increased risk of colonization/infection.[67] Similarly, Legionella spp. have a predilection for infecting immunocompromised patients, and transplant recipients have the highest risk. Moreover, Legionella spp. have been the most common cause of nosocomial pneumonia among transplant recipients at selected medical centers.[68] Neutropenic patients (PMNLs <500/mm3), in particular, are at risk of fungal infections. Most guidelines recommend broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy in neutropenic patients if they become febrile for any reason.[69] Consequently, especially in neutropenic patients who remain febrile and develop pulmonary symptoms during the course of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, fungal pneumonia should be considered.[70] Although Pneumocystis carinii (P. jirovecii) is best known for infecting HIV-infected patients with low CD4 counts (<200/mm3), patients with hematological malignancies, solid tumors, collagen-vascular diseases and transplant recipients are also at risk.[71] Particularly in at-risk patients who have a protracted hospital stay, specimens obtained by bronchoscopy should also be tested for P. carinii.",

However, recent data confirm that patients with COPD are at increased risk for P. aeruginosa HAP, and that this is the strongest risk factor after prior use of antibacterials and prolonged hospital stay.[72] Similarly, in 2002 Trouillet et al.[61] identified the presence of underlying fatal medical conditions as an independent factor associated with HAP with P. aeruginosa. In 2000, Akca et al.[73] demonstrated in 33 cases of VAP by P. aeruginosa that early-onset HAP can also be caused by these resistant bacteria and that this was significantly associated with emergency intubation, aspiration and a Glasgow Coma score of \u22649. However, early-onset VAP was defined by the time of intubation and, as a result, prolonged hospital stay may still be the leading risk factor. Furthermore, culture data were based on tracheal aspirates and could merely have resulted from colonization of the tube.",

            "text": "In the ATS guidelines thoracoabdominal surgery and witnessed aspiration are pointed out as risk factors for developing HAP with anaerobic microorganisms. This was based on a study by Bartlett et al.[93] performed in 1986 on cultures of pleural effusions, blood and nonquantitative cultures of tracheal aspirates. This study needs careful interpretation because based on today\u2019s knowledge of bronchoscopic sampling, the anaerobes found in 35% of cases of HAP may well have been the result of sampling of high airway colonization.[94] Because of the technical difficulties and relatively high costs, most microbiological laboratories do not routinely employ anaerobic culture techniques for respiratory specimens. However, sometimes even simple measures can improve the diagnosis of anaerobic infections; PSB samples should be transported in thioglycolate instead of saline.[95] Overall, the role of anaerobes in HAP may be underexposed in the literature. However, a few studies have appeared since the ATS statement, using bronchoscopic sampling techniques and anaerobic culturing. The main anaerobic strains isolated were Prevotella melaninogenica (36%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), and Veillonella parvula (12%). VAP with anaerobes occurred significantly more often in patients who were orotracheally intubated than those nasotracheally intubated and significantly more frequently in early-onset VAP than late-onset VAP. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of altered levels of consciousness, higher disease severity, and admission to the medical ICU were the factors independently predisposing to the development of VAP with anaerobes.[96] In contrast, Marik and Careau[97] performed a similar study and found only one anaerobic microorganism in 75 patients with HAP. Also, in 12 patients with observed aspiration, no anaerobes were recovered from the bronchoscopically obtained samples. Eight years after the ATS statement, too few studies have appeared to establish the exact role of anaerobes in HAP. However, their presence as co-pathogens should always be suspected, especially in intubated patients or after aspiration. Analogous to CAP, patients with HAP and periodontal disease, bronchiectasis or bronchial stenosis (by tumor, stenosis or foreign body) may also be at increased risk for anaerobic pulmonary infection.[70] In contrast to HAP, the role of anaerobes in lung infections is mostly accepted in obstructive pneumonia and lung abscess.[70,94] On the other hand, anaerobes are usually of low virulence and many patients commonly recover from HAP without receiving specific anti-anaerobic therapy.",

As is stated in the ATS guidelines, empirical treatment for nosocomial pneumonia does not include specific antibacterials against Legionella pneumophila. As a result, mortality from legionnaires\u2019 disease is high in patients who receive inappropriate antibacterial therapy. Two reports by Chang et al.[98] and Goetz et al.[99] demonstrate that routine environmental cultures play a major role in stimulating the application of Legionella laboratory testing. In both studies positive water-system samples subsequently identified unsuspected patients with nosocomial legionnaires\u2019 disease.[99] As this confirms the ATS guideline, clinicians and microbiologists should indeed bear in mind the need to also test for legionnaires\u2019 disease in patients with severe or culture-negative HAP. This is especially true if patients are at risk for legionnaires\u2019 disease during high-dose corticosteroid treatment, malignancy, renal failure, neutropenia or cytotoxic chemotherapy.[4] In 2000, a study by Stout et al.[100] revealed that long-term care residents are at risk of acquiring nosocomial legionnaires\u2019 disease in the presence of a colonized water system. Consequently, nosocomial legionnaires\u2019 disease should be suspected if a sudden flare-up of incidence is noted.[12,101,102] Therefore, urine antigen tests for L. pneumophila type 1 should be readily available if even the slightest possibility of legionnaires\u2019 disease exists (see also section 4).",

The definition of \u2018core antibacterials\u2019 is that they have activity against enteric Gram-negative bacteria, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and MSSA. Since P. aeruginosa is only seldom found in this patient group, \u2018core antibacterials\u2019 need not have anti-pseudomonal activity. First-choice antimicrobial therapy for these core pathogens would consist of either a cephalosporin or a \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combination. cephalosporins of the second generation (e.g. cefotetan, cefoxitin, cefuroxime) or non-pseudomonal third generation (e.g. ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime) are recommended. \u03b2-Lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combinations are amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam. In a study by Speich et al.[110] the efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam, the most recently developed \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combination, was compared with that of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the treatment of severe pneumonia.[110] The agents proved to be equally and highly efficacious treatments. However, only a minority of pneumonias in this study was of nosocomial origin and consequently Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp. and Serratia spp. were not encountered as core pathogens.",

The major mechanism of bacterial resistance to these recommended \u03b2-lactams is bacterial production of \u03b2-lactamases that can hydrolyze \u03b2-lactam antibacterials to inactive compounds. Different types of \u03b2-lactamases are produced by different bacteria. Second-generation cephalosporins are resistant to the \u03b2-lactamases produced by certain strains of H. influenzae, Klebsiella, E. coli and S. aureus. Although these \u03b2-lactamases can hydrolyze amoxicillin, ticarcillin or piperacillin, when combined with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, hydrolysis is prevented and the antibacterial retains its activity. However, \u03b2-lactamases produced by certain strains of Enterobacter, Serratia, and Citrobacter (class C, type AmpC) are also capable of hydrolyzing amoxicillin despite the presence of clavulanic acid. Paradoxically, clavulanic acid is a stronger inducer of AmpC \u03b2-lactamases, which it cannot inhibit, than sulbactam and tazobactam. However, the real concern lies with strains that produce Amp C \u03b2-lactamases in large quantities (\u2018hyperproducers\u2019), leaving only the carbapenems, certain fourth-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefepime and cefpirome), fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides as alternatives.[85,111] These so called \u2018de-repressed\u2019 mutants have become very prevalent, with incidences of 25\u201340% in major hospitals in North America and Western Europe.[112\u2013114] The risk of selecting derepressed mutants during therapy is approximately 20% when third-generation cephalosporins are used to treat bacteremia caused by Enterobacter spp.[115] and is probably higher in pneumonia.[112] However, induction does not usually take place within a couple of days of therapy. Therefore, if after a few days culture results indicate Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp. or Serratia spp. as the pathogen, in severe cases a change of therapy should be considered. If local epidemiologic data demonstrates high incidences of one of these species, \u03b2-lactamase production may already have been induced and henceforth empirical therapy should altogether be switched to therapy as is suggested in table III.",

Although the role of anaerobes in HAP is not clear, under some circumstances (described in section 2.6 and table IV) specific anaerobic antimicrobial therapy should be considered. In a relatively small study in patients with HAP, the most frequently isolated anaerobic bacteria were Prevotella spp., which were more frequently resistant to cefotaxime (37%), ceftazidime (50%), and ciprofloxacin (32%) than usually reported in the literature.[116] Sixty-six percent of these strains produced \u03b2-lactamases. From these results it could be concluded that patients who had received empirical anti-anaerobic antimicrobial therapy had a significantly better outcome after 10 days.[116] Moreover, since penicillin-resistant anaerobic organisms, usually Bacteroides spp., can also be encountered in infections of the lower respiratory tract,[117] specific anaerobic treatment may be warranted. Of the core antibacterials (table I) only cefoxitin and cefotetan (second-generation cephalosporins)[118] and \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combinations possess sufficient activity against anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis. Therefore, if a patient is suspected of HAP with possible involvement of anaerobes, first-choice empirical therapy should consist of these drugs or any combination with clindamycin or metronidazole. However, several case-controlled studies have suggested that metronidazole monotherapy of anaerobic pulmonary infections is less effective than clindamycin as a single drug.[119\u2013121] Since clindamycin is also active against many Gram-positive microorganisms (e.g. S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci) this would be the first choice in patients with HAP with increased risk for anaerobic pneumonia. However, clindamycin has limited or no activity against some strains of B. fragilis. Therefore, in selected cases of HAP with a high suspicion of anaerobic microorganisms (e.g. observed aspiration or post-obstruction pneumonia) combination therapy with clindamycin and metronidazole can be considered.",

However, in North and Latin America, respectively, 44% and 46% of all S. aureus isolates from patients with pneumonia consisted of MRSA.[122,123] Similar rates are found in Europe and Japan.[79,124] Therefore, if MRSA is highly prevalent and the patient is at risk of HAP with S. aureus, empirical therapy should consist of a core antibacterial plus vancomycin.[125] From earlier studies quinupristin/dalfopristin has been considered to be an option for unresponsive MRSA infections, where few proven treatment options exist.[126] In cases of patient allergy or intolerance to glycopeptides, in one study quinupristin/dalfopristin proved to be equally safe, but somewhat less efficacious than vancomycin.[127] Other alternatives are teicoplanin and linezolid (see section 3.1.4). However, vancomycin is not the drug of choice for patients infected with MSSA. In a study by Gonzalez et al.,[63] mortality was significantly higher among MSSA-infected patients treated with vancomycin than among those treated with cloxacillin (47% vs none). Hence, if culture results show susceptible S. aureus as a single pathogen, therapy should preferably be switched to flucloxacillin or nafcillin monotherapy.",

If there is a risk for legionnaires\u2019 disease, specific empirical treatment should be considered. Instead of erythromycin plus rifampicin, as is stated by the ATS, recent literature suggests that fluoroquinolones or newer macrolides (e.g. azithromycin) should now be considered first-choice therapy for legionnaires\u2019 disease.[128\u2013130] Rifampin (rifampicin) may have additional efficacy in severe cases of HAP.",

In these patients, next to the core pathogens, the main concern is the high prevalence of P. aeruginosa and other multiresistant bacteria. Particularly in patients with mechanical ventilation, HAP caused by these microorganisms is associated with increased mortality.[131,132] Because bactericidal synergy against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. has been shown when carbenicillin and an aminoglycoside are combined, the use of an antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam (piperacillin, ticarcillin, ceftazidime, or imipenem) in combination with an aminoglycoside remains the preferred therapeutic approach where possible.[133] Similarly, when considering time-kill curves in vitro, the combination of ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin plus tazobactam achieved greater killing than other combinations or monotherapy against P. aeruginosa.[134] Whether synergistic activity against P. aeruginosa can be achieved or not, there is another reason for combining two different antibacterial categories; when P. aeruginosa is implicated, monotherapy, even with broad-spectrum antibacterials, is associated with a rapid increase in resistance and a high rate of clinical failure. Therefore, for pseudomonal HAP, combination therapy consisting of an antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin) is advised.[135] ",

In a large epidemiological study involving the ICUs of 25 European university hospitals (SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program) resistance to oxacillin was found in 39% of all collected S. aureus strains. However, all these isolates were fully susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin.[137] Two studies have examined the use of linezolid as an alternative treatment to vancomycin: in both studies patients received linezolid plus aztreonam or vancomycin plus aztreonam as empirical treatment for HAP.[138,139] Clinical cure and microbiological eradication rates were equivalent between treatment groups. Similar results were documented for HAP patients with MRSA.[138,140] Linezolid is well tolerated and has a major advantage over vancomycin in that oral formulations are also available.[141] Another possible alternative treatment for HAP with MRSA is quinupristin/dalfopristin.[142] Similar to linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin also has in vitro activity against most MRSA strains, comparable to teicoplanin and vancomycin.[143] In one study by Fagon et al.,[127] 31% of MRSA cases treated with quinepristin/dalfopristin were clinically successful. Nonetheless, there was 44% success in the vancomycin-treated group. More studies will be needed to examine the clinical potentials of these drugs as empirical therapy for HAP with a high risk of MRSA. Teicoplanin is an effective and safe alternative for vancomycin in the treatment of resistant Gram-positive infections. However, the use of teicoplanin in the treatment of HAP has not been investigated. Consequently, teicoplanin should only be considered in selected cases of MRSA where other alternative treatment is contraindicated.",

More than 70% of strains were resistant against ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin, ticarcillin and aztreonam. Only 25% of all strains were resistant against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Thus, in patients highly suspected of HAP with S. maltophilia (e.g. during an outbreak), it is now recommended to initiate empirical treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ticarcillin/clavulanic acid in combination.[151] ",

The best survival rates (\u226580%), even when mice were infected with a multiresistant strain, were obtained with regimens containing rifampin and sulbactam. This suggests that non-classical combinations of \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor and rifampin should be considered for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by multiresistant A. baumannii.[152] This was confirmed by Montero et al.[153] using an experimental pneumonia mouse model with carbapenem-resistant strains: colistin appeared far less potent in reducing lung bacterial counts, clearance of bacteremia, and survival than imipenem, sulbactam, rifampin and tobramycin.[153] From another mouse model study, doxycycline plus amikacin was suggested as an alternative to imipenem in the therapy of A. baumannii pneumonia.[154] ",

They offer excellent activity against Gram-negative bacilli and improved Gram-positive activity (e.g. against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus) over ciprofloxacin. Furthermore, these agents may result in cost savings especially in situations where, because of their potent broad-spectrum activity and excellent bioavailability, they may be used orally in place of intravenous antibacterials. However, there is only limited experience with levofloxacin and moxifloxacin in the treatment of HAP. In one large study (n = 438) with most patients on mechanical ventilation, levofloxacin monotherapy proved equally efficacious as imipenem/cilastatin in both microbiologic eradication rate and clinical success rate.[155] The diagnosis of HAP was based on clinical symptoms, radiographic findings and respiratory cultures. However, patients in this study were also included based on a positive sputum culture, making the diagnosis of HAP less reliable. Furthermore, patients with severe disease were excluded and the mean APACHE II scores in both groups were relatively low. Another point of concern is raised by recent reports that have shown failure of treatment with levofloxacin in several cases of pneumococcal pneumonia.[156,157] Therefore, the use of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin in HAP should be restricted to selected cases pending the results of future investigations.",

Patients with CPIS \u22646 were randomized to receive either ciprofloxacin for 3 days or standard care (antibacterials for 10\u201321 days). After 3 days patients in the ciprofloxacin group were re-evaluated; all patients with CPIS >6 received further treatment for pneumonia, but all patients with CPIS \u22646 at 3 days had antibacterial treatment stopped. Antibacterials were continued beyond 3 days in 90% (38 of 42) of the patients in the standard therapy group compared with 28% (11 of 39) in the experimental therapy group (p = 0.0001).

Mortality and length of ICU stay did not differ despite a shorter duration and lower cost of antimicrobial therapy in the experimental group. More surprisingly, antimicrobial resistance, or superinfections, or both, developed in 14% (5 of 37) of patients in the experimental group versus 38% (14 of 37) of patients in the standard therapy group (p = 0.017).",

Although most antibacterials are marketed as \u2018one dose for all\u2019, each patient may require an individualized dosage. To ensure good initial antibacterial tissue concentrations, initial antibacterial therapy of HAP should be administered intravenously. Switching to oral administration should not be considered before the first signs of clinical improvement. In contrast to research on HAP, several reports on treatment of CAP have appeared since 1996 investigating an early switch from intravenous to oral antibacterials.[165\u2013169] Although patients with CAP have different microorganisms and a dissimilar pathogenesis at play, certain parallels can be made. It appears that hospitalized (non-ICU) patients with mild CAP can be treated safely with only a short course (\u2264 3 days) of intravenous antibacterials and that a subsequent treatment of 7 days with oral antibacterials is sufficient in most cases.",

In most patients, clear clinical improvement should not be expected within 24 hours after the start of antibacterial treatment. Dennesen et al.[158] have shown that leukocyte counts, temperature and oxygenation normalize, on average, 6 days from the start of antibacterials. However, the first signs of improvement of clinical parameters were found within 48 hours. Consequently, failure of treatment cannot be established within 24 hours after start of therapy. However, in severe cases of VAP or in patients on mechanical ventilation because of HAP, who experience ongoing deterioration of clinical parameters, switching antibacterial treatment to a more broad-spectrum regimen should first be considered after 24 hours. This is especially true in patients for whom microbiological results remain inconclusive. In mild to moderate cases, changing antibacterial therapy should not be considered until at least 48 hours have passed since the start of therapy. The CPIS score can help to monitor the development of VAP (or patients with HAP on mechanical ventilation) after start of therapy. Luna et al.[170] have shown that in patients who received adequate antibacterial treatment (no resistant microorganisms were cultured) and recovered from VAP, the CPIS score was significantly improved at day 3.[170] In contrast, patients who had inadequate antibacterial treatment and did not survive VAP, did not display improved CPIS scores at day 3. In two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures, clinical improvement or worsening was most accurately depicted by the PaO2/FIO2 ratio. In another study with 298 patients with HAP, multivariate analysis revealed that six variables were associated with decreased likelihood of clinical success; >65 years of age, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, mechanical ventilation for >5 days, multilobar pneumonia, and bacteremic pneumonia.[127] Patients who fail to respond, or experience clinical deterioration, should be re-examined carefully, and thought should be given to the possibility of other noninfectious processes.[171] In cases of raised suspicion of resistant pathogens, fresh endobronchial specimens for culture should be obtained.",

Although a bacterial etiology of HAP is the most frequent, viruses are also potential pathogens.[172\u2013174] Clinically, viral pneumonias are difficult to differentiate from bacterial pneumonias. Since viral agents are not routinely tested for, the incidence of viral pneumonias is almost certainly underestimated.[173] Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections contribute substantially to the morbidity and mortality associated with viral pneumonia, especially in young children and the elderly.[174,175] Other viruses associated with HAP are parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes virus and measles.[176] Patients at risk for developing serious pneumonia with these viruses are neonates and immunocompromised patients. Extra suspicions for a viral etiology of HAP should be raised during and following the annual community outbreaks of influenza and RSV.[177] ",

In rare cases of infections with type 2 L. pneumophila, and in mild cases, antigen tests lack sensitivity and can give a (false) negative result.[178,179] Patients with neutropenia or patients receiving intensive treatment with corticosteroids (e.g. patients with COPD) are at risk for more acute presentations of Aspergillus spp. infections. However, even in non-immunosuppressed, non-neutropenic patients, severe VAP resulting from Aspergillus spp. has been reported.[180] Consequently, especially in high-risk patients with extended hospital stay and failure of antibacterial treatment, cultures for fungi of BAL or PSB specimens, and serum fungal antigen tests should be considered.",

Although this subgroup consists of patients with severe nosocomial pneumonia, more research on non-ICU patients is needed to explore whether the same guidelines apply to less severe cases of HAP. From the large body of literature on the diagnosis of HAP it can be concluded that bronchoscopic techniques, in combination with quantitative cultures, are superior to other more conservative techniques to obtain respiratory samples and to establish early diagnosis. Detection of intracellular microorganisms in lower respiratory tract specimens has been demonstrated to be a reliable marker for the early diagnosis of HAP. Furthermore, microscopic examination can give a first impression of the type of pathogen involved.",

In order to identify those patients at risk of HAP with multiresistant microorganisms, more risk factors have been identified since the ATS statement; prolonged stay in the hospital and prior antibacterial therapy seem to be the most important risk factors for resistant pathogens. However, increasing numbers of resistant pathogens are reported. Since epidemiology can vary from one hospital to another, epidemiological surveys should be conducted to assess locally encountered pathogens of HAP. Consequently, general guidelines (e.g. ATS guidelines) should be adapted to local epidemiology.",
