Although the probability that one individual user would retweet a piece of message relates to his interests and intention, crowds of users would not resist telling others about uncommon stories from a macroscopic perspective. This pattern corresponds to an individual\u2019s infection caused by a contagion, who contacted by an infectious person will get infected, even though some are immune to such a contagion. The emerging super-spreaders and the consequent super-spreading phenomenon in a social media scheme are also both analogous to the respective connotations in the field of epidemiology. In epidemiology, the term super-spreader  [8], [9] refers to a host that infects disproportionally more secondary contacts than others who have also been infected with the same virus or bacteria. Correspondingly in information propagation, a super-spreading story will spread in a notably large range on OSNs through a minor portion of users. Cases in disease spreading mostly conform the 20/80 rule  [9], where approximately 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of disease transmissions. Comparably, situations in information diffusion commonly comply the rule of 1%  [10] in Internet culture, in which 1% of users contribute to the distribution mostly, while the other 99% spread little.",

[11] modeled information diffusion in implicit networks through a simple linear model, which can be utilized to quantify and predict the influence of users, and inspired us. But their model does not fit quantitative analysis of characterizing super-spreading phenomena. Lerman et al.  [6] are the first to characterize the spread of news on OSNs by using epidemic models. Then, Abdullah et al.  [7] formulated a clear epidemic-based model for news spreading on Twitter, following whom, there have been several studies based on epidemic models. The simple but operational and adoptable epidemic method of modeling is exploited to track trending topics, rumors and generic information on OSNs. These information propagation models are modified based on conventional epidemic models, such as the SIR model, the SEIR model, etc. Based on the SIR model, Li et al.  [12] considered various kinds of user behaviors on Weibo and divide users into four groups with different transition rates between groups. Meng et al.  [13] added a new compartment into the conventional SIR model in order to catch the phenomenon of rumor spreading in real life. Xia et al.  [14] introduced a new class representing authorities that can diffuse authoritative information to prevent rumors from spreading. Zhao et al.  [15], [16] modified the SIR model to integrate forgetting and remembering mechanisms with variable forgetting rate to catch rumor dissemination characteristics. Zhou et al.  [4] studied the characteristics of \u201cinformation bomb\u201d by leveraging a modified SIR model, which include influence breadth and strength of dynamic of information diffusion. Work by Xu et al.  [17] and Zhao et al.  [18] took into account complex network features to model information dissemination in mobile social networks and rumor spreading in the new media age, respectively. Zhang et al.  [19] introduced a latent group of users who would be infected by an infectious individual, become latent and later then infectious. Although none of them addressed the super-spreading phenomena that benefits the information diffusion cascades on OSNs, previous work has shed light on the modeling of super-spreading.",

Moreover, many infectious diseases were reported as super-spreading events  [21], i.e., observed infections unveiled evident heterogeneities in pathogen transmission, with some individuals exhibiting a higher ability to infect others. An epidemic compartmental model, SIPR, was proposed to model the super-spreading events during SARS  [22]. By splitting the infected people into two classes with different \u201cremoval\u201d rates, a normal class I for normal infectious individuals and a new class P that stands for super-spreaders, the SIPR model can capture the effect of super-spreaders during the SARS outbreaks in Hong Kong. But due to its focus on particular infectious disease spread, this epidemic model cannot be easily modified to model information propagation. After all, we will build a new model based on the conventional SIR model to accomplish this task.",

It is worth noting that the components and text content of a retweet on Weibo differs from that on Twitter. Unlike Twitter, a retweeter can add some opinions when he reposts the retweet on Weibo, and he will usually keep any text content that already added by previous retweeters. Trails implying the message propagation path from previous retweeters will be generated automatically by Weibo system whenever a post is retweeted, in the form of \u201c@userC: Repost // @userB: {content_added_by_userB} // @userA: {content_added_by_userA}\u201d. Through this structural form, we know that a tweet posted by an initial user has been reposted by userA, then userB reposts the retweet of userA, and finally userC is the last one to retweet. In this way, we can state that the initial user influenced userA, userA influenced userB, and finally userB influenced userC. Thus, the networks of information diffusion can be extracted from the dataset via all trails like this. In a diffusion network, nodes are users who repost (except the author of the initial tweet), and every directed edge indicates which user reposts whose retweet.",

A super-spreader  [8], [9], once a susceptible one, but infected by an infectious user, will infect more secondary contacts from the susceptible class than other infectious individuals. On the contrary, the majority of individuals infect relatively fewer secondary contacts during epidemic spreading. Similarly, a super-spreader on OSNs would influence more users than others, causing users to be influential to influence others. Correspondingly, most users are less influential. One simple heuristic is to develop a new population class portraying the dissimilar behavior of super-spreaders.",

A case study of fitting to real world dataset is conducted, and parameter settings are obtained for both the SAIR model and the SIR model. Through comparison between fitted results of both models, the SAIR model is validated to show much more promising to characterize a super-spreading event of information propagation than the conventional one.
