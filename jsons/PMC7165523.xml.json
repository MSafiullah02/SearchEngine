During that \u2018open window\u2019,\n3\n the sensitivity to URT\n4\n\n,\n\n5\n\n,\n\n6\n and possibly also to other infections is potentially increased. If resting periods between such exercise sessions/ competitions are not long enough to allow the immune function to recover, an increased sensitivity to infectious diseases may be present for a prolonged period of time.\n7\n\n,\n\n8\n The potential for such a situation truly exists among the high\u2010 performing elite within several areas of sports and notably so in seasonal endurance sports. For URT infections, it has been suggested that a J\u2010shaped curve best describes the relationship between the intensity of physical activity, ranging from a sedentary lifestyle to the activity of the high\u2010performance endurance athlete (along the x axis), and the sensitivity to infections (along the y axis).\n9\n\n,\n\n10\n Interestingly, a recent study in elite swimmers has indicated that measurement of salivary IgA levels over a training season may be predictive for athletes at risk of infection.\n11\n\n",

This is to satisfy the increased nutritional needs of the activated immune system and to provide substrates for the accelerated energy production during fever, which is generally associated with anorexia and decreased food intake. The elevated insulin levels during infection and fever generally hamper the mobilization of fatty acids from fat depots.\n12\n\n,\n\n13\n\n",

Several mild infections, however, such as an uncomplicated common cold, may not give rise to any significant systemic acute phase reaction. This array of acute phase responses, one of which is the occurrence of fever, is triggered by the release of cytokines from activated macrophages and monocytes.\n12\n\n,\n\n13\n Similarly, exercise is accompanied by increased body temperature and increased immune activity.\n15\n However, although exercise has been shown to be associated with the release to plasma of endogenous pyrogen,\n16\n a majority of studies do not support the idea that exercise hyperthermia is the result of a change in the body temperature set point,\n17\n as is the case in infection.",

These few experimental studies on bacterial infections in rodents have shown that one bout of vigorous exercise shortly prior to infection drastically increases the resistance to the infection. Conversely, when the infection is contracted before the time of exercise, strenuous exercise is detrimental to the host. All animal experiments of which we are aware concerning non\u2010myocarditic bacterial and viral infections have shown that strenuous exercise during the febrile phase of an infection may be hazardous. For obvious ethical reasons, analogous experiments in humans are not feasible. For a more extensive review, see Friman and Ilb\u00e4ck.\n13\n Interestingly, however, the muscle trainability seems to be preserved during some but not other infections. In experimental tularaemia in the rat, for example, strenuous exercise during the acute febrile course counteracted, but did not eliminate, the infection\u2010 associated muscle catabolism, yielding a net result of more limited protein degradation than in resting infected animals,\n18\n whereas in experimental influenza no anabolic effect of the exercise was seen.\n32\n In both experiments, exercise during ongoing febrile infection caused complications or increased lethality.",
