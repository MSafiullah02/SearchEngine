New pathogens emerge periodically to keep us on our toes as is evinced by emergence and spread of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, Zika and HIV epidemics. Development of multidrug resistance among bacteria, fungi and viruses is challenging our ability to fight back and herald difficult times ahead.4 Even diseases once considered eradicated (such as anthrax and smallpox) have a potential to make a comeback as a result of rogue intent.",
