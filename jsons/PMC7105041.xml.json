Few countries have a Kawasaki disease registry.4 The incidence of Kawasaki disease in Taiwan has also been reported previously. Both hospital surveys and claims data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) have been used.6, 19, 20 However, there are some discrepancies in the data derived from these two resources (Table 1\n).6, 19, 20 The hospital survey is regarded as noncomprehensive and subject to double counting when patients are transferred between hospitals. As the NHI has been available in Taiwan since 1996 and covers more than 98% of the population,22, 23 epidemiologic data retrieved from its database are regarded as more reliable and comprehensive. However, previous reports using claims data from the NHI focused on admission with a main diagnosis code of Kawasaki disease. Whether the reason for admission was the acute stages of this disease or not was not well defined.6, 19 This might somewhat overestimate the disease incidence.",

Moreover, most people in Taiwan are descendants of Chinese people. Therefore, the incidence in Taiwan should be similar to that in China. Hence, from both a geographic and a genetic viewpoint, the results of our study are feasible. Some might argue that this method might underestimate the incidence of Kawasaki disease because there must be some patients who were diagnosed late and not given IVIG. However, Kawasaki disease is regarded as a catastrophic disease by the Bureau of NHI, and the cost of IVIG is covered. Pediatricians in Taiwan are familiar with Kawasaki disease. Therefore, we do not think that many patients were misdiagnosed, as we show in Table 3. Furthermore, if a patient was afebrile at the time of diagnosis, there was no indication for admission.",

Two previous reports claimed that Taiwan had the most patients in summer.6, 19 This may reflect that certain cases were repeatedly counted when they were not admitted for Kawasaki disease in acute stages. Our results revealed that the peak season in Taiwan was late spring to early summer (April\u2013June). Spring is warm and humid in Taiwan, which facilitates the transmission of airborne infectious diseases. Moreover, our study showed that the incidence declined when the SARS outbreak occurred in 2003. Huang et al's6 study failed to take this phenomenon into account. At the time of SARS outbreak, people, including young children and infants, were confined to their houses and came in contact with others less often. As a result, transmission of viral illness among young children might have been reduced. This provides some support to one hypothesis about the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease, which states that Kawasaki disease is an immune reaction caused by some kinds of infectious agents.1, 15, 24 Our results using IVIG as the indicator are similar to those found in reports from Hong Kong and Beijing and somewhat different from those found in reports from Japan and Korea.2, 8, 9, 10 We believe that our results are more reasonable from both a geographic and a genetic perspective, as we mentioned above. When we counted only children older than 5 years of age, we found that the number of patients was highest in February, July, and August. These 3 months are winter and summer vacations in Taiwan. This finding might suggest that some children with a past history of Kawasaki disease were admitted for survey during their vacations. This phenomenon might have influenced the results of previous reports (Table 4, Table 5).6, 19\n",

We believe that the discrepancy is caused by the shorter study period (2003\u20132006) of their report. Therefore, a certain number of patients were censored. However, the recurrence rate was 1.16% when we used IVIG as the indicator. In comparison with Japan (3%), the recurrence rate was significantly lower in Taiwan.10 The lower incidence of Kawasaki disease in Taiwan might contribute to the lower recurrence rate. These discrepancies also reflect a possible fallacy in the methodology of previous studies. As physicians code Kawasaki disease as the main diagnosis to receive reimbursement for catastrophic disease from the Bureau of NHI and avoid peer review, the recurrence rate should have been overestimated in previous reports.6, 19\nTable 6 shows that 251 patients (1.9%) had more than two episodes of Kawasaki disease in the ICD-9 set. Kawasaki disease usually recurs only once.10 On the contrary, if we use IVIG as the indicator, only nine patients (0.1%) had more than two episodes. We believe that the patients who had more than five episodes were outliers. However, we do not think that the estimation of recurrence rate would not be influenced significantly using IVIG as an indicator.",

This reflected another possible fallacy in the methodology of previous studies. Children with a past history of Kawasaki disease and coronary aneurysms could be included in a survey when they reached school age, but that does not mean that they should be regarded as acute cases. Although older age has been reported to be a risk factor for coronary aneurysm in the United States,14 we do not believe that this association exists in Taiwan. Some might argue that the diagnosis of older children might be delayed and hence the timing of IVIG administration might be missed. However, it is hard to believe that all the patients older than 9 years were misdiagnosed and not given IVIG. Previous reports from Taiwan noted that older age, being a risk factor for complications, might actually reflect some patients who were readmitted for survey, and the disease in not for acute stages.6, 19 The coronary aneurysm rates could be underestimated because the aneurysms could develop later, after discharge from hospital. However, in order to compare with previous reports,6, 19 we adopted only the diagnosis codes at admission.",
