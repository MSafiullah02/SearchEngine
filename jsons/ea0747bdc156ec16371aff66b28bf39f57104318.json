            "text": "An urgent problem in controlling COVID-19 spreading is to understand the role of undocumented infection. We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumu-1 arXiv:2003.12028v1 [q-bio.PE] 26 Mar 2020 lated number of confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the hidden individuals.",

            "text": "For COVID-19, a number of data analysis studies have provided estimates of the basic parameters underlying the spreading dynamics. In particular, the very first 425 confirmed cases were analyzed (2) with the findings that the average incubation period was 5.2 days, the doubling time was about 7.4 days and the basic reproduction number R 0 was about 2.2 extracted from the exponential growth behavior, and the infection due to personal contacts had already occurred. An analysis (3) of the 72314 confirmed cases in China up to February 11, 2020 found 889 asymptomatic cases (about 1.2%) and 1023 deaths (2.3%). From the growth curve, it was extrapolated that the epidemic in China would peak about January 23-26. An analysis of a data base of large number of samples revealed (4) the median incubation period of about four days, quartile of five days (two-seven days), and death rate about 1.4%. According to the joint China-WHO Joint Investigation Report on New Crown Pneumonia, the median time interval between symptom appearance and confirmation in China was 12 days (8-18 days) in January and reduced to three days (1-7 days) at the beginning of February, but in Wuhan the respective numbers are 15 days (10-21 days) and five days (3-9 days). Initial usable data indicated that, the median time between mild symptoms and cure was about two weeks, while that between severe symptoms and cure was between three and six weeks, and it took about one week to go from initial symptoms to severe illness such as hypoxia. Among the cases who did not survive, the time from initial symptoms to death was between two and eight weeks. There are similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome associated Coronavirus) or MERS-Cov (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome associated Coronavirus), but there are also differences (3) . While the propagation scenarios among the three viruses are similar, the rapid spreading in China and evidence of infection through human-to-human contacts suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than SARS-Cov or MERS-Cov, and the strong infectability during the relatively long incubation period is particularly worrisome (5) . These features of SARS-CoV-2, in spite of the associated relatively small death rate, can cause more damage to the society, posing a significant challenge to control, mitigation, and prevention.",

            "text": "For virus spreading, developing an effective mathematical model for making reliable predictions is of paramount importance to quantitatively assessing the epidemic trend as well as to control and prevention. In dealing with recent viruses of worldwide impact such as SARS-Cov (6), MERS-Cov (7), Ebola (8) and ZiKa (9) viruses, the modeling approach played an indispensable role. For COVID-19, an SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model was developed (10) based on the OAG (Official Aviation Guide) data, the inter-city population movement data from Tencent, and parameters values with the incubation and infectious periods taken from SARS-CoV. Utilizing cases outside of China, which were originated from Wuhan, to inversely deduce the epidemic spreading process in major cities in China, the authors (10) estimated the R 0 value to be 2.68 and the doubling time of 6.4 days. Further, it was predicted that by January 25, 2020, the number of infected cases in Wuhan would be 75,815. This model is quite effective, but two main deficiencies stood: the relevant parameter values were from the previous epidemic of SARS-CoV and, the infectability during the incubation period, perhaps the most distinct feature of SARS-CoV-2, was not taken into account. The SEIR model was also used with parameter values from People's Daily (the official Central Chinese Government newspaper) to estimate the R 0 value based on the initial exponential growth (11) , with the result R 0 \u2248 2.8 \u223c 3.3. Another study (12) based on the population movement data from Tencent and Baidu carried out a statistical analysis of the geographic distribution of the population exiting Wuhan, giving an assessment of the impact of this type of population on the epidemic. An improved SEIR model (13) taking into account the infectability during the incubation period and incorporating machine learning trained based on the data from 2003 SARS-CoV, predicted that the epidemic in China would peak in the second half of February and stabilize at the end of April. A remarkable result (13) was that, should the Central Government's rigorous quarantine and control measures be delayed for five days, the size of the epidemic in China would be tripled and, if the lockdown measures of Wuhan were relaxed, a second peak would emerge and last through the second half of April. An assumption in this model was that the incubation time distribution is Markovian, i.e., the occurrence time of the transition from incubation to being infected follows the Poisson distribution with exponentially distributed interevent time. However, for COVID-19, the assumed Markovian spreading process is too idealized, as there were substantial empirical data (4) indicating that the incubation period of COVID-19 has a strong non-Markovian characteristic, i.e., there is a time delay between incubation and appearance of symptoms. A delayed spreading model incorporating the non-Markovian characteristics was then developed (14) , taking into account the city lockdown and using an inverse approach for parameter estimation, which predicted the infection rate for mainland China of about 0.23 and isolation rate of about 0.42. A difficulty is that the current isolation measures in China were implemented in response to the development of the epidemic, which are time-dependent and may even be temporal. It has been predicted (4) that, had the implementation of the government control measures been delayed for five days, the epidemic scale in mainland China would have been three times larger. The effects of travel restrictions in China on global COVID-19 spreading have also been studied (15) .",

Our model predicts that, if this fraction exceeds a certain value, the epidemic duration can increase by as long as two months, rendering likely a future outbreak. Another prediction is that the decay of the hidden population can be slower than that of the infected one and can maintain at a small but non-zero value for an extended period of time, and this has potentially devastating consequences: the activities of these individuals in combination with the unusually strong virulence of SARS-CoV-2 imply that they are a \"time bomb\" for a large scale outbreak in the future.

The total population of the country is N = 66 millions. We simulate four scenarios. tics associated with the various state transitions, and the exponential decay of population activity level under strict government actions. Our model requires four parameters to simulate the spreading dynamics: the fraction \u03b7 of undocumented virus-carrying individuals spontaneously recovered or died, the effective infection rate, the initial size of the population in incubation, and the rate of reduction in human activities due to government actions. These parameters can be obtained from government reports, reasoned, or estimated through a mathematical inverse optimization approach. The model is capable of real-time prediction, and has been validated as its prediction of the number of daily accumulative confirmed cases agrees remarkably well with the current data. The effects of government actions, as measured by the parameter \u03b7, can vary greatly among different countries. For example, in South Korea, almost all possible individuals exposed to the virus went through nucleic-acid tests, while such tests are not being conducted in countries such as Japan, the United States, and United Kingdom, leading to abnormally low number of confirmed cases. Countries such as Italy are perhaps somewhere in between, so a large fraction of asymptomatic/undetected virus-carrying individuals without going through any medical treatment exists. In this case, the epidemic size would be significantly larger with a prolonged duration. This not only has provided a natural explanation for the abnormally high mortality in Italy, but also implied a devastating picture for the epidemic trend: even after the epidemic has been deemed over, there can still be a small population of asymptomatic individuals in the society, making a future outbreak and COVID-19 evolving into a long epidemic or a community disease a real possibility.",

Right from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a concern that it could evolve into a community disease and will always be with us. However, this was merely a speculation without any quantitative justification. Our work has provided theoretical and modeling based evidence for the likelihood of COVID-19 becoming a community disease. This has grave consequences and significant implications. For example, for the current COVID-19 epidemic in China, our model predicts a few dozen such H-state individuals. As the government measures are gradually withdrawn, these individuals could diffuse into the general population, leading to the next COVID-19 epidemic/pandemic. But the currently implemented and enforced epidemic control policies cannot be maintained indefinitely for economical, social and other reasons. What should the government do then? Before the successful development of an effective and feasible vaccine, one possibility is to conduct universal testing of the entire population to identify the remaining H-state individuals. Having said that, we are not in a position to provide a solution to this problem. Rather, our goal was to generate scientific support for government policies on controlling and preventing future large scale COVID-19 epidemic, which we believe has been achieved in the current work.",

In China, there is now evidence that many cases of mutual spreading occur in closed environments such as families, factories, and even prisons, which are not affected by travel restriction. The effects of such spreading scenarios on the epidemic need to be studied. Another issue is to investigate COVID-19 spreading dynamics on larger spatial scales. In particular, our model is especially suited for an isolated city such as Wuhan, where the current description and understanding of the spreading dynamics subject to rigorous implementation of government measures are reasonable. However, as the range of epidemic increases, the effect of large scale population movements on the spreading dynamics must be studied, possibly through the approach of network modeling with subpopulation dynamics. As the epidemic spreading begins to weaken or diminish, government actions will inevitably be relaxed. How to effectively prevent a second epidemic is an urgent problem. Also, is it possible to articulate time-dependent control and preventive measures that are adaptive to the development of the epidemic?

On January 10, 2020, the health officials of Wuhan city confirmed, through nucleic acid detection, 41 cases. Coincided with ChunYun, the annual period of mass migration in China for the Spring Festival holidays, the virus began to spread from Wuhan city to other regions of China. On January 23, 2020, the Health Department of the Central Chinese Government locked down Wuhan, a city of 11 millions, and a number of other cities and regions in Hubei province, and at the same time implemented rigorous, nationwide travel restrictions, in an attempt to prevent large scale spreading of the disease (1). In spite of the strict measures, suspected and confirmed cases began to emerge in almost every province and major city of China, with a rapid increase in a short time period. On February 11, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses designated the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on the same day, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease as COVID-19. The unprecedented, rigorous measures imposed by the Central Chinese Government have proven to be quite effective at controlling and suppressing the spread, stabilizing its dynamics. At the time of writing, there were only a few newly confirmed cases in China. While spreading in China has apparently diminished, SARS-CoV-2 has begun to emerge in counties and regions outside China, with large scale spreading in South Korea, Italy, Iran, and now in the United States. With the likelihood that COVID-19 would become a catastrophe in public health, on February 28 WHO has raised the global risk level of the new corona pneumonia epidemic from \"high\" to \"very high.\" On March 11, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.",

An individual in S is healthy but can be infected. An individual in H carries the virus but is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and he/she can infect other individuals. There are two types of individuals in the H state: those who are quarantined and those who are not. Individuals in the I state have been infected and exhibit symptoms. A fraction of the infected population have been confirmed and hospitalized, to which we designate a new state, J. Finally, individuals in the R state are either recovered or died of the disease. Because of the strong government actions, the infected individuals are fully aware of their state and are either quarantined or self-isolated; these individuals thus would not spread the virus, which is especially true for those in the J state who are in hospitals. Likewise, individuals in the R state are not infectious. Thus, in our model, only the individuals in the H state are able to infect others to spread the virus. Note that, one could define the H state as one that contains the asymptomatic individuals and those who are symptomatic but have not been identified. In this case, the duration of the H state consists of the medical incubation period (from the time of infection to the time of symptoms) and the time taken to isolation, while the I state contains symptomatic and isolated individuals with a time between isolation and confirmation. The distributions of the H and I time can be obtained from empirical data. The spreading dynamics are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.

The value of \u03b7 is taken to be 0.012, the official value from the Chinese Epidemic Disease Control Center.

If the value of \u03b7 is 0.75, the number of days required for the epidemic to end would be about 200. At \u03b7 \u2248 0.6, a crossover between the two lines occurs: after that the H state population lasts longer than that of the I state, setting the stage for a possible second outbreak. However, since the average time interval between infection and confirmation is \u03c4 4 , the observed occurrence of the inflection point would be delayed by \u03c4 4 , i.e., February 14-15, which was indeed the time reported by the Chinese government. The epidemic cycle is predicted to end towards the end of March when the number of infected individuals approaches zero, which agrees with the currently observed epidemic trend in China. The above prediction of the epidemic trend in China in terms of H(t) and I(t) is based on the choice \u03b7 = 0.012, i.e., among all the H-state individuals, only 1.2% are undetected and spontaneously recovered or died eventually, which is reasonable, considering the extremely strict monitoring and quarantine policies currently in place in China.

This means that, had the Chinese government not taken the unprecedentedly dramatic steps to contain the COVID-19 spreading, the epidemic cycle could easily last into the summer. Figure 2(b) also shows the model predicted time required for the hidden, virus-carrying populationto vanish versus \u03b7, which is also approximately exponential. The striking phenomenon is that the exponential rate is larger than that with the infected population. The two lines intersect at \u03b7 \u2248 0.6, indicating that, if \u03b7 exceeds 60%, the time for the H-state population to vanish can be longer than that required for the I-state population to diminish. Should the government actions be withdrawn when it is determined that I(t) is already practically zero, the continuous exis-tence of the remaining H-state population could be the source for a future outbreak! This group of virus-carrying individuals in the hidden state can diffuse into any place in the country or in the world, and they represent a \"time bomb\" for a new epidemic if the control and preventive measures of the government are completely withdrawn.

(c,d) The predicted epidemic behaviors in the hypothetical scenario that the lockdown of the epicenter were delayed for five days, where other parameter values are the same as those in (a,b), respectively. The delay would cause the final size of the infected population to be doubled and lead to a somewhat prolonged epidemic duration.Prediction for South KoreaFor South Korea, we use the reported data (21) of the number of confirmed cases between January 30 and March 13. The epidemic emerged mainly in the cities of Daegu and Gyeongsangbukdo, so we set N = 5 millions (the approximately combined population of the two cities). The two cities, being the epicenter, were locked down on February 21, so we have t 0 = 21. The value of \u03b7 is not available, so we test two different values: 0.1 and 0.5, with the values of the other three model parameters estimated to be (\u03bb * , H * (0), \u03b2 * ) = (0.18, 91, 0.27) and (\u03bb * , H * (0), \u03b2 * ) = (0.26, 155, 0.23), respectively. The prediction results for the two sets of parameter values are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. In spite of the difference in the choice of the value of parameter \u03b7, in both cases our model predicts the following: occurrence of the epidemic peak (inflection point) on March 5\u223c7, the final number of confirmed cases of about 9200, and the epidemic duration of approximately three months. These predictions agree with the current data in South Korea. For the two choices \u03b7 = 0.1 and \u03b7 = 0.5, there is a small difference in the predicted ending date of the epidemic: about May 6 for the former and May 13 for the latter. We also simulate the hypothetical scenario where the lockdown of the two cities were delayed for five days, with the results for \u03b7 = 0.1 and \u03b7 = 0.5 shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), respectively. Inevitably, the predicted curves of the accumulative number of confirmed cases deviate from the data, but the final epidemic size would double and the epidemic could last longer. Prediction for Italy: Why is the mortality so high? For Italy, we use the reported number of confirmed cases between January 30 and March 13. The entire country was locked down on March 8, so we have t 0 = 38. The total population of Italy is N \u2248 60 millions. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) present the model prediction results of H(t), I(t), and J(t), together with the actual up-to-date J(t) data, for \u03b7 = 0.1 and \u03b7 = 0.5,respectively.

The result of an earlier lockdown would reduce the final epidemic size by approximately a factor of two. cially, in China, confirmed individuals are treated at hospitals but in Italy, 80% of such individuals are isolated in their home (undocumented) and only 20% are treated, leading to a relatively large value of \u03b7. The predicted results inFigs. 4(a) and 4(b), where the value of \u03b7 is relatively small, thus may not reflect the actual epidemic behavior. To remedy this deficiency, we carry out prediction for \u03b7 = 0.8, with results shown inFig. 5(a). It can be seen that the predicted Model prediction of COVID-19 epidemic trend in Italy taking into account the actual effect of lockdown.

Our model prediction for large values of \u03b7 provides a reasonable explanation.In particular, while the predicted number of confirmed cases does not depend strongly on the value of \u03b7, the case of \u03b7 = 0.8, which more closely describes the current effects of government actions in Italy, has devastating consequences. Especially, \u03b7 = 0.8 means that about 80% of the virus-carrying individuals eventually enter into the R state after a time delay \u03c4 3 , without going through any medical treatment. Since the population in the R state consists of both recovered individuals and deaths, under the assumption that the death rate with COVID-19 is invariant across different countries, the significantly large fraction of people switching directly from the H state to the R state means significantly more deaths.Prediction for IranFor Iran, lockdown occurs on March 7, so we have t 0 = 16. The total population is N \u2248 88 millions. Model predicted results are shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) for \u03b7 = 0.1 and \u03b7 = 0.5, respectively. In both cases, the infected population will reach its peak around March 23. As for other countries, the value of \u03b7 does not affect the prediction of the inflection point.
