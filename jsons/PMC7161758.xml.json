Void of viral genetic material, these noninfectious particles possess biologically desirable traits that are attributed to the particulate viral structure (Grgacic & Anderson, 2006; Pattenden, Middelberg, Niebert, & Lipin, 2005). Of particular interest is their efficient recognition, cellular uptake, and processing by host immune systems. VLP technology is a rapidly expanding field, which aims to embrace such features to achieve specific biological outcomes. VLPs are amenable to a broad range of modifications including encapsulation, chemical conjugation, and genetic manipulation (Rold\u00e3o, Mellado, Castilho, Carrondo, & Alves, 2010). This versatility of VLPs, combined with the natural ability to package and deliver nucleic acids has prompted their use as biodegradable delivery agents for gene therapy (Takamura et al., 2004; Tegerstedt, Franzen, et al., 2005). The successful packaging of peptides, proteins, and synthetic drugs into VLPs has revealed a prospective role in drug delivery (Kaczmarczyk, Sitaraman, Young, Hughes, & Chatterjee, 2011; Zdanowicz & Chroboczek, 2016). In the diagnostic field, VLPs containing gadolinium have shown potential as molecular imaging contrasting agents (Schwarz & Douglas, 2015) while the application of VLPs as research surrogates to study the clearance of live viruses has also been demonstrated (Johnson, Brorson, Frey, Dhar, & Cetlin, 2017; Loisy et al., 2005). At the forefront of VLP technology impact, however, is vaccinology.",

VLP technology can overcome numerous drawbacks associated with traditional methods of vaccine production; specifically, the infectious nature associated with live and inactivated vaccines and the lengthy production time. Synthetic biology, the redesign and construction of novel artificial biological organisms, pathways or processes, is revolutionizing vaccine production. When applied to VLPs, synthetic biology allows for more precise and predictable control over the composition and assembly of the viral capsid. This, in turn, widens the range of unrelated antigenic modules that can be incorporated. Consequently, vaccines can be engineered for prophylactic or therapeutic means (Jennings & Bachmann, 2009) to match specific viral strains (Schwartzman et al., 2015) or to generate multivalent (Pushko et al., 2011) or broadly cross\u2010protective (Ben\u2010Yedidia, 2011) vaccines. Moreover, new bioprocessing modalities including in vitro assembly (Chuan, Fan, Lua, & Middelberg, 2010) and cell\u2010free expression (Bundy, Franciszkowicz, & Swartz, 2008), open the way to reimagined vaccine production processes.",

Reverse vaccinology combines genomics with proteomics and bioinformatics to identify virtually all potentially protective antigens from coding regions within the genome (Bambini & Rappuoli, 2009; Rappuoli, 2007). Comparative genomics is primarily used to design broadly protective vaccines as it allows comparison of conserved and variable open reading frames within the same species. Functional genomics allows the identification of protein function based on reverse genetic evaluation (mutations and knockouts) or gene expression analysis (transcriptomics; Bagnoli et al., 2011; Bambini & Rappuoli, 2009; Rappuoli, 2007; Sette & Rappuoli, 2010). Although genomics per se has contributed significantly to the design of many vaccine candidates, such as influenza (Prabakaran et al., 2010; Pushko et al., 2011; Pushko et al., 2017), malaria (Draper et al., 2015; Y. Wu, Narum, Fleury, Jennings, & Yadava, 2015), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Calazans, Boggiano, & Lindsay, 2017), its full potential for vaccine development can only be realized when integrated with proteomics and immunomics (Bagnoli et al., 2011). Moreover, the coordinated deployment of these omics technologies along with miniaturized bioprocess screening in, for example, microbioreactor and microfluidic cell culture systems can aid developability assessment leading to accelerated manufacture (Bhambure, Kumar, & Rathore, 2011; Gong & Lei, 2014; Hemmerich, Noack, Wiechert, & Oldiges, 2018).",

An example of immunomics application to VLP vaccine design is GlaxoSmithKline's RTS,S vaccine, the most advanced malaria vaccine candidate. RTS,S is a chimeric VLP in which a large portion of the C\u2010terminal of Plasmodium falciparum\u2010derived circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is displayed on a protein scaffold (hepatitis B surface antigen; Y. Wu et al., 2015). In combination with systems biology (genomics and proteomics), immunomics was used to highlight regions within CSP that were immunogenic and protective in humans and, thus, indispensable to incorporate into a chimeric VLP. From the many candidates identified, only one proved to be successful in Phase IIa/b efficacy trials (Draper et al., 2015; Kazmin et al., 2017).",

These imaging methods provide essential data to solve the three\u2010dimensional structure of a VLP, therefore, help to identify optimal VLP insertion sites for display of any given antigen. Many VLP platforms have been developed so far using this structure\u2010based design approach.

Combined with recent technological advances in human immunology, systems immunology can provide guidance for rational vaccine design. Systems immunology allows the assessment of most cell types of the immune system (including specialized B and T white blood cells), their state, function, signaling molecules, and encoding genes (Bird, 2017). This accumulation of data captures a snapshot of the human immune system, providing valuable information for the creation of human immune response models that may later be translated into improved vaccine design (Davis et al., 2017). A systems immunology approach was previously undertaken to investigate the immune response to the live attenuated yellow fever vaccine YF\u201017D (Hou et al., 2017; Muyanja et al., 2014). Following immunization, comprehensive characterization of the immune system was performed providing insights into the vaccine's mechanism of action. A similar method was later applied to the malaria vaccine RTS,S, where a systems\u2010level approach led to the identification of molecular and cellular signatures associated with protection and immunogenicity unique to this VLP\u2010based vaccine (Kazmin et al., 2017). Systems immunology may also play an important role in designing vaccines capable of stimulating parts of the immune system not addressed by current vaccines (Davis et al., 2017). VLPs are ideal testing candidates for systems immunology approach due to their ability to stimulate B\u2010cell\u2010mediated immune responses, as well as CD4 proliferative responses and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses (Gause et al., 2017).",

Potential B\u2010 and T\u2010cell epitopes can be mapped using bioinformatics and computational biology tools, however, without recent improvements in immunological characterization methods, the identification of epitopes that optimally stimulate the human immune response becomes challenging (Rappuoli, Bottomley, D'Oro, Finco, & De Gregorio, 2016). The ability to isolate memory B cells through high\u2010throughput FACS followed by in vitro culture enables secretion of sufficient amounts of recombinant monoclonal antibodies or antigen\u2010binding fragments to allow for antigen screening in binding and functional assays (J. Huang et al., 2013). The ultimate goal being the incorporation of specific antigenic regions on a VLP scaffold. Thus, improving vaccine specificity for generation of effective vaccines.

This is particularly relevant when dealing with pathogens capable of evading the immune system due to their high mutation rates. The Protein Variability Server (PVS) is a valuable tool for the identification of such conserved epitopes, which can facilitate the development of broadly protective vaccines (Garcia\u2010Boronat, Diez\u2010Rivero, Reinherz, & Reche, 2008). In this study, PVS was used to identify a conserved fragment in the ectodomain of HIV\u20101\u2010gp41. Several databases retain classified and well\u2010curated data from experimentally verified vaccines and/or vaccine components and, thus, are useful tools for vaccine design. The Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (Peters et al., 2005; https://www.iedb.org) collects all published experimental data characterizing immune epitopes and the context in which the molecular structure is recognized as an epitope by the immune receptors. IEDB has over 88,382 epitopes and multiple tools to identify B\u2010 and T\u2010cell epitopes (Vita et al., 2015). The Syfpeithi database (Schuler, Nastke, & Stevanovikc, 2007; http://www.syfpeithi.de) has information on MHC classes I and II anchor motifs and binding specificity.

The AntigenDB (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/antigendb/) stores sequences, structures, origins, and epitopes of pathogen antigens (Ansari, Flower, & Raghava, 2010). The Computationally Optimized Broadly Reactive Antigen (COBRA) methodology was recently developed to overcome the challenges associated with antigenic diversity in influenza subtypes (Carter et al., 2016). This in silico approach, which uses consensus building to generate a number of antigen candidates termed COBRA antigens, was used to identify HA antigens that were broadly protective against H1N1 strains.

Enveloped VLPs are self\u2010assembling capsids, which acquire a lipid layer when budding from their host cells. This layer is absent in nonenveloped VLPs (Mateu, 2011). Insertion of heterologous antigens (otherwise known as modularization) into nonenveloped VLPs is mainly achieved through genetic fusion or chemical conjugation (Peacey, Wilson, Baird, & Ward, 2007). The size of the insert has implications for VLP assembly and correct presentation of the antigen. Small peptide epitopes are easily inserted into VLP structures without affecting VLP assembly, which can often occur when modularizing whole or large protein domains. Genetic fusion is the most popular method despite being time\u2010consuming and error\u2010prone (Mateu, 2011). Chemical conjugation supports the insertion of large antigens in preformed VLPs and these modifications are performed on naturally occurring conjugation sites using chemical crosslinkers or enzymes (Patel & Swartz, 2011; Tang, Xuan, Ye, Huang, & Qian, 2016). The downside of chemical conjugation is the incurred cost as it requires the production of both the VLP and the epitope(s) as well as conducting the chemical conjugation (Chackerian, 2007; Smith, Hawes, & Bundy, 2013). Recently developed technologies have started to address the cost and technological challenges. An example is the \u201cPlug and Display\u201d system, a technology based on two proteins, \u201cthe tag\u201d and \u201cthe catcher,\u201d which react irreversibly when in close proximity of each other. When \u201cthe catcher\u201d is fused to a VLP and \u201cthe Tag\u201d is fused with a vaccine target, these form a two\u2010component VLP vaccine ready to use (Brune et al., 2016). Examples of nonenveloped VLPs used to display foreign antigens are HBcAg (Chu et al., 2016), HPV L1 protein (Slupetzky et al., 2001), and Q\u03b2 (O'Rourke, Peabody, & Chackerian, 2015).",

With pseudotyping, one can alter the VLP stability or even its tropism (Cronin, Zhang, & Reiser, 2005; K. Palomares et al., 2013).

            "text": "High immunogenicity is a desirable vaccine attribute that potentially translates to protectivity against target infections. To enhance immunogenicity, modularized antigens must be strategically inserted to maximize their presentation to the immune system. Modularization of peptides to the N\u2010 or C\u2010termini of viral proteins has been previously reported (De Filette et al., 2008; Haynes et al., 1986). However, low surface expression or the inability of peptides to adopt native conformation can result in weak immunogenicity at these insertion sites (Sch\u00f6del et al., 1992). Platforms based upon HBcAg, papillomavirus (bovine and human), Flock House virus (FHV), and others, are thus engineered to take advantage of surface\u2010exposed loops that demonstrate enhanced immunogenicity (Murata et al., 2009; Slupetzky et al., 2007; Ye et al., 2014). Peptides inserted into exposed loops protrude from the surface of VLPs making them more accessible to the immune system. Short peptides displaying relatively simple structures pose little problem for modularization within exposed loops, yet those with more complex structures require further platform engineering (Anggraeni et al., 2013). Incorporation of epitope scaffolds into exposed loops of VLPs maintain the structural properties of complex peptides as shown with the presentation of a 20aa A\u2010helix of the influenza HA2 chain on the FHV platform (Schneemann et al., 2012). This strategy, however, requires detailed structural knowledge of the chosen peptide and the identification of a suitable scaffold fragment. Antigens inserted into the immunodominant loops of the HBcAg platform require closely juxtaposed N\u2010 and C\u2010termini to maintain VLP integrity (Walker et al., 2011). This imposes considerable limitations upon antigen choice. To support the modularization of antigens that possess an extended structure, a SplitCore system has thus been devised (Walker et al., 2011). Dividing the HBcAg core protein within the immunodominant c/e1 loop yields two fragments, which are able to form VLPs when coexpressed. Fusion of antigen to the c/e1 termini of either fragment before coexpression enables modularization of antigens that may otherwise have been structurally incompatible.",

Their large size, however, can cause steric hindrance resulting in compromised VLP assembly (Lua, Fan, Chang, Connors, & Middelberg, 2015). As such, several strategies have been developed to specifically modularize large antigens. Long, flexible glycine\u2010rich linkers were engineered to flank the antigen in the c/e1 loop of the HBcAg platform, allowing spatial separation and enabling proteins of up to 238aa to be inserted (Kratz, Bottcher, & Nassal, 1999). Though effective, optimal linker length for different antigens needs to be empirically determined. Steric hindrance can also be addressed in some cases by reducing the antigen content on the surface of the VLP. For example, Peyret et al. (2015) engineered a single polypeptide composed of an unmodified HBcAg fused to a chimeric HBcAg. A dual expression construct was also devised to coexpress unmodified murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) VP1, with antigen\u2010modularized VP1 displaying an 18 kDa rotavirus antigen (Lua et al., 2015; Tekewe, Fan, Tan, Middelberg, & Lua, 2017). Although such methods can lead to successful VLP assembly, it is possible that increasing the antigen mass, whereas reducing the antigen number may be reflected in lower immunogenicity, as is seen with the synthetically derived RTS,S malaria vaccine (Pitoiset et al., 2015). Nevertheless, this trade\u2010off is inevitable as the mass of the antigen increases relative to the carrier, necessitating an understanding of the optimization domain.",

Host contaminants can be removed by VLP disassembly and ex vivo reassembly, as necessitated for licensing of HPV L1 VLPs (McCarthy, White, Palmer\u2010Hill, Koenig, & Suzich, 1998). Unfavorably, this complicates downstream processing and adds to manufacturing costs. Synthetic modification of the HPV L1 and MuPyV VP1 proteins has led to the development of capsomere platforms (Middelberg et al., 2011; Schadlich et al., 2009). Removal of the carboxyl termini from each protein yields capsomeres incapable of forming VLPs in vivo. MuPyV capsomeres display increased stability, although less immunogenic than VLPs when administered with adjuvant they are just as effective (Middelberg et al., 2011).

The vast majority of studies producing M1\u2010VLPs utilize either mammalian cell lines (transient or stable expression) or insect cell lines (mainly transient expression using the baculovirus expression system, IC\u2010BEVS). Synthetic biology has recently been applied to the IC\u2010BEVS platform to overcome process\u2010related drawbacks. When produced in IC\u2010BEVS, VLPs and baculovirus are not easily separated owing to current limitations in purification and analytical techniques. A recently developed biorthogonal labeling strategy enables distinction between baculovirus and HA containing M1\u2010VLPs. Thus, allowing greater control over vaccine contaminants (Carvalho et al., 2016). This system involves fluorescent labeling of an azide\u2010tagged noncanonical amino acid, which is incorporated into the HA protein within the enveloped VLP. Combinatorial analysis using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry demonstrated the possibility of obtaining VLPs independently of baculovirus.

In cases where posttranslational complex modification is required, IC\u2010BEVS is used to manufacture licensed VLP vaccines, such as Cervarix\u00ae and Porcilis PCV\u00ae, yet vaccine costs are high, owing partly to low production yield.

To surpass the drawbacks of traditional coinfection strategies and/or larger, unstable viral vectors, a modular expression system in which the number of genes to be expressed is rationally distributed between a recombinant viral construct and a stable cell line can be adopted.
