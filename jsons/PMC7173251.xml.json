These proteins then facilitate the rescue of the viral RNA from translation and the viral RNA is selected/recruited for replication. This is followed by the assembly of the viral replicase on subcellular membrane surfaces. The assembled replicase complex produces complementary minus-strand (\u2212)RNA using the original (+)RNA as a template. Then, the minus-stranded RNA intermediate is used by the viral replicase to synthesize excess amount of new (+)RNA progeny, which is released from the site of replication to the cytosol and/or become encapsidated to form new viral particles (Ahlquist et al., 2003, Panavas et al., 2005a). One of the amazing things about (+)RNA viruses is that they complete an infection cycle within 6\u201324 h in the primary infected cells. Thus, (+)RNA virus infection is often a fast race between the parasite and the host to gain control over the resources of the host cell.",

Many RNA viruses are known to form spherules (small membrane invaginations) with small openings towards to the cytosol (Fig. 1\n) (Kopek et al., 2007, Schwartz et al., 2002). These spherules are the sites of RNA replication and frequently connected with the sites of virus assembly (Ahlquist, 2006). But how are these spherules formed and what is the role of the co-opted host factors? Although we do not yet know the answers to these fascinating questions, it is likely that efficient recruitment of all the viral and host factors are critical for replication.",

For example, the Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) p33 auxiliary replication protein recognizes a C\u22c5C mismatch within an extended hairpin in the viral RNA (Monkewich et al., 2005, Pogany et al., 2005). The Brome mosaic virus (BMV) 1a helicase-like protein binds to the subgenomic promoter region in RNA3 to facilitate the selection of the RNA for replication (Wang et al., 2005). The flock house virus (FHV) protein A replication protein specifically recognizes the 5\u2032 sequence in the RNA facilitating its recruitment to the mitochondrial outer membrane (Van Wynsberghe and Ahlquist, 2009). In spite of these advances in our understanding of the template selection process, we do not yet know how the translating ribosomes are removed from the (+)RNA templates selected for replication. Models have been proposed that viral replication proteins or host factors, such as Lsm proteins, promote the switch of the RNA from translation to replication (Beckham et al., 2007).",

            "text": "A key step in viral replication is the assembly of the viral replicase on the cytosolic surfaces of intracellular membranes, which is a poorly understood process (Salonen et al., 2005). The viral replicase consists of viral-coded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), viral auxiliary replication proteins, the subcellular membrane, and co-opted host proteins. Among these factors, the contribution of host factors to the viral replication process is the least understood. The host factors likely complement the functions of the viral replication proteins to regulate RNA replication. Moreover, the host components in the replicase complex likely provide protection from host cellular ribonucleases, including the powerful gene silencing machinery, as well as they might be involved in delaying the recognition of viral components by the host surveillance system. The host factors are also likely responsible for activation of RdRps of several (+)RNA viruses, such as p92pol of TBSV, 2apol of BMV, P2 of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), 180K of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B. These viral RdRps become activated only after the assembly of the viral replicase in membranous spherules or vesicles (Panaviene et al., 2004, Panaviene et al., 2005, Quadt et al., 1995, Vlot et al., 2001). Although the role of host factors during the assembly of the replicase and the activation of RdRp is currently unknown, they likely work together with the viral RNA as well, which also plays a key role in these processes.",

            "text": "TBSV and other tombusviruses are model plant RNA viruses with a single 4.8-kb genomic (g)RNA component. The gRNA codes for two replication proteins, termed p33 and p92pol, and produces two subgenomic RNAs for the expression of three viral proteins involved in cell-to-cell movement, encapsidation, and suppression of gene silencing (Nagy & Pogany, 2008, White & Nagy, 2004). Recent advances with tombusviruses have been accelerated by the development of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model host to study TBSV replication and recombination (Nagy, 2008, Panavas & Nagy, 2003). Yeast expressing p33 and p92pol replication proteins can efficiently replicate a short TBSV-derived replicon (rep)RNA (Panavas & Nagy, 2003, Panaviene et al., 2004). Importantly, replication of the TBSV repRNA in yeast depends on the same cis-acting RNA elements and trans-acting p33/p92 replication proteins as in plants (Nagy, 2008, Panavas & Nagy, 2003). The DI-72 repRNA, which is derived naturally from TBSV infections of plants, does not encode proteins and it can replicate efficiently in yeast cells without maintaining an artificial selection pressure. Moreover, the tombusvirus repRNA plays several functions, including serving as a template for replication and as a platform for the assembly of the viral replicase complex (Nagy & Pogany, 2008, Panaviene et al., 2005, Pogany et al., 2005). The viral RNA also participates in RNA recombination (Serviene et al., 2005, White & Morris, 1994, White & Nagy, 2004), which likely plays a major role in virus evolution. Altogether, the development of yeast as a model host for TBSV facilitated the application of the available genomics and proteomics tools to identify host components required or affecting TBSV replication and virus\u2013host interactions (Jiang et al., 2006, Li et al., 2008, Li et al., 2009, Nagy, 2008, Nagy & Pogany, 2006, Panavas et al., 2005b, Serva & Nagy, 2006, Serviene et al., 2005, Serviene et al., 2006).

Grouping of the identified host genes based on their known cellular functions revealed that TBSV replication depends on a wide variety of gene functions belonging to 11 different groups. These include five genes involved in protein biosynthesis by either being part of the ribosome or acting as a translation elongation factor. The other groups are involved in protein metabolism, such as ubiquitination pathway and posttranslational modification (eight genes), RNA metabolism (five genes), and in lipid metabolism (five genes). A large group includes 20 genes implicated in vesicle-mediated transport, affecting endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, vacuole transport, or membrane fusion.

Overall, the host genes identified as being essential are represented almost at twice the ratio (3.75%) when compared with the nonessential genes (2%), suggesting that tombusviruses might have adapted to use and/or dependent on essential genes to higher extent than on nonessential genes.

Mutational analysis of eEF1A suggests that it might be involved in promoting (\u2212)RNA synthesis by the replicase complex (Z. Li and P.D. Nagy, unpublished data). Another function of eEF1A is to stabilize the p33 replication protein, while it did not affect the half-life of the less abundant p92pol replication protein in yeast (Li et al., 2009). Interestingly, a prokaryotic homolog of eEF1A, called Tu translation elongation factor, plays a role in replication of bacteriophage Q\u03b2 (Blumenthal et al., 1976). In addition, eEF1A was found to bind to many viral (+)RNAs, including the 3\u2032-UTR of Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) (Dreher, 1999), of West Nile virus (WNV), Dengue virus, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Turnip mosaic virus (De Nova-Ocampo et al., 2002, Nishikiori et al., 2006, Thivierge et al., 2008, Zeenko et al., 2002). In addition, eEF1A has also been shown to interact with the NS5A replication protein of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (Johnson et al., 2001), NS4A of HCV (Kou et al., 2006), the TMV replicase (Yamaji et al., 2006), and the Gag polyprotein of HIV-1 (Cimarelli and Luban, 1999). The biochemical functions provided by eEF1A for (+)RNA virus replication are currently poorly understood. It has been proposed to affect minus-strand synthesis for WNV (Davis et al., 2007), albeit it repressed minus-strand synthesis of TYMV in vitro (Dreher, 1999, Dreher et al., 1999, Matsuda et al., 2004). Overall, the interaction of eEF1A with viral RNAs and viral replication proteins and its high abundance in cells might facilitate recruitment of eEF1A into virus replication.",

The TBSV p33 replication protein can be phosphorylated (Shapka et al., 2005, Stork et al., 2005) and ubiquitinated (Barajas et al., 2009a, Li et al., 2008) with both modifications likely playing roles in TBSV replication. Accordingly, Cka1p, Mob1p, Mps1p, Sln1p kinases and Siw14p phosphatase have been identified in the genome-wide screens (Table I\n). Albeit it is yet unknown what host kinases phosphorylate p33 in cells, protein kinase C (PKC) was shown to phosphorylate purified p33 in vitro. Interestingly, the sites of p33 phosphorylation are located proximal to an essential RNA-binding domain (Shapka et al., 2005, Stork et al., 2005). Since the phosphorylated form of p33 lost its ability to bind to (+)rep RNA and in vitro phosphorylation of the p33:repRNA complex led to the release of the RNA from the complex, it has been proposed that phosphorylation of p33 and possibly p92, which carries the same p33 sequence at its N-terminus due to its overlapping ORF, might lead to the release of the viral RNA from the replicase complex (Stork et al., 2005).",

A purified preparation of Cdc34p ubiquitinated p33 in vitro, indicating that Cdc34p is active on the p33 substrate in the absence of an E3 enzyme. Downregulation of Cdc34p level decreased TBSV repRNA accumulation and the activity of the tombusvirus replicase by three- to fivefold. Interestingly, a Cdc34p mutant inactive in ubiquitin conjugation could not complement the reduced amount of wt Cdc34p based on the activity of the isolated tombusvirus replicase (Li et al., 2008), suggesting that the ubiquitination activity of Cdc34p is critical for TBSV replication.

However, unlike Cdc34p, Rsp5p inhibits TBSV replication by binding via its three WW repeats to p92pol and destabilizing p92pol and reducing the replicase activity (Fig. 5\n). Surprisingly, the HECT domain involved in protein ubiquitination is not required for the inhibitory activity of Rsp5p (Barajas et al., 2009b). Future experiments should address what is the role of Rsp5p in regulation of TBSV replication.",

Nsr1p seems to be an inhibitor of TBSV replication since virus replication was boosted threefolds in the absence of NSR1. Nsr1p binds to the upstream portion of the 3\u2032-UTR, known as RIII in DI-72 (+)RNA (Jiang et al., 2010). The binding of Nsr1p to RIII(+) is relevant since the inhibitory effect of Nsr1p on DI-72 repRNA accumulation in vivo was lost when DI-72 repRNA lacked RIII sequence. Regulated overexpression of Nsr1p revealed that Nsr1p must be present at the beginning of viral replication for efficient inhibition. Moreover, the purified recombinant Nsr1p inhibited the in vitro replication of the viral RNA in a yeast cell-free assay only when preincubated with the viral RNA before the in vitro replication assay (Jiang et al., 2010). These data suggest that Nsr1p likely inhibits an early step, such as RNA recruitment, in the replication process. We propose that Nsr1p may inhibit TBSV replication via specific binding to the viral RNA and, thus, resulting in inefficient viral RNA recruitment for replication.",

The NS1 protein of influenza A virus binds to nucleolin and colocalizes with nucleolin in the nucleolus, possibly affecting cellular events, such as shut down of host protein synthesis (Murayama et al., 2007).",

Xrn1p inhibits tombusvirus replication and might be a component of the host innate immunity. Xrn1p is a major enzyme in the RNA degradation pathway in yeast (Johnson, 1997, Sheth & Parker, 2003). Xrn1p is involved in degradation of tombusvirus RNA, including partially degraded viral RNAs generated by endoribonucleases (Cheng et al., 2006, Cheng et al., 2007, Jaag & Nagy, 2009). In the absence of Xrn1p/Xrn4p, accumulation of tombusvirus RNA increased several fold as well as novel viral recombinant RNAs emerged rapidly in yeast and in plants. Moreover, based on a yeast cell-free TBSV replication assay, which supports authentic replication and recombination of TBSV, it has been shown that the purified recombinant Xrn1p efficiently inhibited the accumulation of recombinants and partly degraded viral RNAs. Altogether, the data from yeast and plant hosts and a cell-free assay confirmed a central role for the cytosolic 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exoribonuclease in TBSV replication, recombination and viral RNA degradation (Cheng et al., 2006, Cheng et al., 2007, Jaag & Nagy, 2009).",

            "text": "Further studies have been performed with Erg25p, a critical enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Sterols are ubiquitous and essential membrane components in all eukaryotes, affecting membrane rigidity, fluidity and permeability by interacting with other lipids and proteins within the membranes (Bloch, 1983, Bloch, 1992). Sterols are important for the organization of detergent-resistant lipid rafts (Roche et al., 2008). Erg25p in yeast and the orthologous SMO1 (sterol-4\u03b1-methyl-oxidase) and SMO2 in plants perform the removal of two methyl groups at C4 position, which is critical and rate limiting during sterol synthesis (Darnet and Rahier, 2004). Indeed, sterol molecules become functional structural components of membranes only after the removal of the two methyl groups at C4. Downregulation or pharmacological inhibition of ERG25 in yeast led to four- to fivefold decreased TBSV RNA accumulation (Sharma et al., 2010). Among the functions provided by sterols during tombusvirus replication, two roles for sterols have been identified. The first function is to facilitate the assembly of the viral replicase complex based on the reduced in vitro activity of the tombusvirus replicase when isolated from yeast cells with reduced level of sterols. The second function is related to the stability of p92pol viral replication protein, which showed approximately threefold reduced half-life when expressed in yeast treated with a chemical inhibitor of ERG25. The bulky p92pol replicase protein might be exposed to cytosolic proteases in sterol-poor microenvironment. Alternatively, the structure of p92pol is different under sterol-depleted condition, leading to premature degradation of p92pol. Moreover, the subcellular localization of p92pol could be different if less than normal level of sterols was available in cells.",

The large number of ESCRT proteins identified during the screens suggests that TBSV might hijack the ESCRT proteins to assist replication. For example, recruitment of ESCRT proteins for TBSV replication could facilitate the assembly of the replicase complex, including the formation of TBSV-induced spherules and vesicles in infected cells (Fig. 1) (McCartney et al., 2005). Indeed, induction of membranous spherule-like replication structures in infected cells might be common for many plus-stranded RNA viruses (Kopek et al., 2007).",

Intriguingly, the ubiquitinated TBSV p33 replication protein was found to interact with Vps23p ESCRT-I and Bro1p accessory ESCRT factors (Barajas et al., 2009a). The interaction has been shown to lead to the recruitment of Vps23p and possibly Bro1p to the peroxisomes, the sites of TBSV replication. This is followed by the recruitment of ESCRT-III proteins, Snf7p and Vps24p, which could help the optimal assembly of the replicase complex, facilitate the grouping of p33/p92 molecules together in the membrane and/or promote the formation of viral spherules by deforming the membrane (membrane invagination). Then, Doa4p deubiquitination enzyme is predicted to remove ubiquitin from the ubiquitinated p33, while Vps4p ATPase likely recycles the ESCRT proteins from the replicase complex at the end of the assembly (Barajas et al., 2009a).",

Moreover, the minus-stranded viral RNA in the replicase from vps23\u0394 or vps24\u0394 yeast became more accessible to ribonuclease, suggesting that the protection of the viral RNA is compromised within the replicase complex assembled in the absence of ESCRT proteins. Thus, the role of ESCRT proteins seems to control the quality of the replicase complex assembly, making the viral RNAs within replicase complex well protected from ribonucleases. Based on these observations, we propose that ESCRT proteins help tombusviruses hide from host defense recognition and avoid the attack by the host defense machinery during viral replication. Similar role for ESCRT proteins or other host factors might help other (+)RNA viruses, which are also known to deform membranes and form spherules during replication.",

Expression of separation-of-function mutants of Pmr1p revealed that the ability of Pmr1p to control the Mn2+ concentration in the cytosol is a key factor in viral RNA recombination. Based on the known cellular function of Pmr1p and in vitro and in vivo TBSV recombination assays, it has been proposed that the Pmr1p Ca2+/Mn2+ ion pump regulates TBSV RNA recombination by keeping the Mn2+ concentration low in the cytosol (Jaag et al., 2010). When Mn2+ concentration is low in the cell, then the RdRp within the viral replicase utilizes the far more abundant Mg2+ over Mn2+, leading to low-frequency RNA recombination. On the other hand, deletion/inhibition of the Pmr1p Ca2+/Mn2+ pump leads to an increased level of cytosolic Mn2+ (Mandal et al., 2000), promoting the more efficient use of Mn2+ by the viral RdRp, which leads to high-frequency RNA recombination. Thus, Pmr1p activity in the cell affects TBSV RNA replication and recombination through regulating the cytosolic Mn2+ level (Jaag et al., 2010). Overall, the emerging picture from the genome-wide studies and the more detailed studies on PMR1 is that complex interactions between TBSV and its host affect not only TBSV replication, but viral adaptation and evolution as well.",

The interaction between Hsp70 and the tombusvirus replication proteins occurs in the functional replicase (Fig. 3), since affinity purification of Ssa1p from the solubilized membrane fraction of yeast resulted in copurification of tombusvirus replicase activity (Wang et al., 2009b). Hsp70 chaperone seems to play multiple and essential roles during TBSV replication (Fig. 5). For example, using a temperature-sensitive mutant of Hsp70 at nonpermissive temperature has led to cytosolic localization of p33 replication protein (Wang et al., 2009a). Shifting down from nonpermissive to permissive temperature resulted in relocalization of p33 to the peroxisome membrane surface in yeast. Subcellular fractionation experiments have shown that the viral replication proteins are mostly cytosolic in ssa1ssa2 yeast at the early time point (Wang et al., 2009b). Interestingly, the viral proteins become partly membrane-bound at a latter time point likely due to partial complementation by the cytosolic, stress-inducible Ssa3p and Ssa4p, which operate at higher levels in ssa1ssa2 cells (Becker et al., 1996, Werner-Washburne et al., 1987). This suggests that Hsp70 is involved in localization/transportation of the viral replication proteins. It has been proposed that the binding of p33 and p92pol replication proteins to Hsp70 results in shielding the hydrophobic transmembrane domains in the replication protein that could prevent their aggregation and promote binding to Pex19p transport protein (see below). The latter interaction is needed for peroxisomal targeting of the replication proteins (Pathak et al., 2008).",

Integration of p33 replication protein into subcellular membranes, such as peroxisomal and ER (Jonczyk et al., 2007), is thought to be critical for tombusvirus replication. This is because p33 mutants localized in the cytosol do not support TBSV replication in yeast or in plant cells (McCartney et al., 2005, Panavas et al., 2005a).

GAPDH is likely co-opted by RNA viruses due to its ability to bind to AU-rich sequences (Nagy & Rigby, 1995, Nagy et al., 2000). Accordingly, GAPDH has been shown to bind to AU-rich sequences present in various RNA viruses, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), HCV, and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (De et al., 1996, Dollenmaier & Weitz, 2003, Randall et al., 2007). The functional role of binding of GAPDH to the above viruses is not yet clear. It has been proposed that binding of GAPDH to the internal entry site (IRES) element in HAV could suppress cap-independent translation of HAV RNA (Yi et al., 2000). GAPDH may also be involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of hepatitis B virus gene expression (Zang et al., 1998).",

Subsequent research on HUR1, however, revealed that its effect on TBSV replication and recombination was due to the PMR1 gene (see Section F), which overlaps with HUR1 on the yeast chromosome (Jaag et al., 2010).

Indeed, it has recently been shown that the host shuttle protein Pex19p, which is involved in peroxisomal membrane protein transport, plays a role in TBSV protein transportation to the site of replication (Fig. 5) (Pathak et al., 2008). Pex19p not only binds to the peroxisomal targeting signals in p33 in vitro, but also it is temporarily associated with the replicase complex. When Pex19p was mistargeted to mitochondrial membranes, the wt p33 was also colocalized to the same mitochondrial membranes (Pathak et al., 2008). However, the role of Pex19p is not essential for TBSV replication since TBSV repRNA replicated as efficiently in pex19\u0394 yeast defective in peroxisome biogenesis as in the wt yeast (Jonczyk et al., 2007, Panavas et al., 2005b). Indeed, confocal microscopy-based approach revealed that the wt tombusvirus p33 replication protein accumulated in the ER in pex3\u0394 or pex19\u0394 yeast lacking peroxisomes, suggesting that tombusvirus replication could occur on the surface of the ER membrane. Moreover, the activity of the isolated tombusvirus replicase from wt, pex3\u0394, or pex19\u0394 yeasts was comparable, indicating that the assembly of the replicase was as efficient in the ER as in the authentic subcellular environment (Jonczyk et al., 2007). Overall, these data demonstrated that TBSV, relying on the wt replication proteins, could efficiently replicate on an alternative intracellular membrane. Thus, RNA viruses might have remarkable flexibility for using various host membranes for their replication.",

The validation of the identified yeast factors has now been done for a growing number of host genes as discussed below.

Importantly, the GAPDH-silenced plants showed resistance against tombusviruses, indicating that this approach could lead to a new antiviral approach. The same strategy did not interfere with the accumulation of an unrelated plant RNA virus (i.e., TMV), which could be due to the lack of function for GAPDH in TMV replication. This is not surprising since TMV is more similar to BMV than to TBSV and it has been shown previously that TBSV is affected by a vastly different set of host factors as BMV (Kushner et al., 2003, Panavas et al., 2005b).",

Accordingly, Hsp70 was shown to be part of the CNV and TMV replicase complexes (Nishikiori et al., 2006, Serva & Nagy, 2006).

Moreover, using chlorpromazine (CPZ) to alter membrane properties of the host cells led to strong inhibition of TBSV accumulation in plants (Sasvari et al., 2009).

The roles of several of these host genes in TBSV replication and recombination have been validated. However, one of the surprising observations is that the genome-wide screens led to the identification of mostly unique host factors that were not identified in other genome-wide screens. It is possible that many genes involved in TBSV repRNA replication and recombination are functionally redundant. Indeed, the host proteins that were identified in the highly purified functional tombusvirus replicase complex (such as Hsp70, GAPDH, and eEF1A) are coded by two or more genes in the yeast genome. This functional redundancy in host genes justifies the need for additional genome- or proteome-wide approaches in the identification of host genes affecting TBSV replication and recombination. Characterization of the functions of all host factors in the infected plant cells will likely result in better, more efficient antiviral strategies and/or reduce the damage to the plants caused by viral infections.",
