            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and is one of the most important infectious diseases in household pet cats. This disease is associated with high mortality, and this is particularly true among younger cats that are housed in breeding catteries and animal shelters [1]. This disease continues to be an elusive and frustrating problem for veterinary practitioners and cat breeders, mainly due to the challenges associated with achieving a definitive diagnosis and determining effective treatments [2]. FIP was first reported in the United States in 1963 as an important disorder in cats [3], and its causative agent was subsequently determined to be a virus [4]. FIPV, a highly contagious coronavirus, has been clearly demonstrated to belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus and family Coronaviridae, which is a virulence biotype of the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) [[5], [6], [7]]. Due to the general application of the generic name feline coronavirus (FCoV) to all serotypes and biotypes of feline coronaviruses, FECV is technically an enteric biotype of FCoV, and FIPV, the mutant form is an infectious peritonitis biotype [8]. Although FIPV is similar to FECV morphologically and serologically, it possesses a highly virulent mutation that results in the development of the fatal feline infectious peritonitis disease that presents the characteristic symptom of fibrin peritonitis\u2014the accumulation of a large number of ascites\u2014and a high mortality rate [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective methods to prevent or control FIPV infection.",

            "text": "FIP is commonly categorized into two clinical phenotypes that include the \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d forms. The wet form causes significant ascites effusion and can be effectively diagnosed following the appearance of clinical symptoms, while the dry form results in the development of granulomas within the organs of cats, making its diagnosis more challenging due to the lack of easily recognizable clinical signs [1,12,13]. Although FIPV is a mutant form of the feline enteric coronavirus FECV [14], it is rarely detected in the feces of cats presenting FIP clinical symptoms [15,16]. The clinical signs of FIP rapidly progress to a severe state, necessitating the requirement of rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. In China, type I and type II FCoV strains have been shown to co-circulate within FIP-affected cats, and the type I FCoV strains exhibit high prevalence and genetic diversity [17]. The traditional method of isolation and identification of the causative virus is not suitable for rapid clinical FIP diagnosis. Although many researchers have used RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR to detect FCoVs in both experimentally and naturally infected cats [[18], [19], [20]], it remains challenging to effectively distinguish FIPVs from FECVs. In some cases, hyperglobulinemia, which is observed in approximately 90% of the FIP-infected cats, could support the clinical diagnosis of the disease [21].",

Subsequently, using the pMD-N with initial concentration of 4.33 \u00d7 108 copies/\u03bcL [which was calculated by the following formula: (6.02 \u00d7 1023) \u00d7 (ng/\u03bcL \u00d7 10\u22129)/(DNA length \u00d7 660)] as a plasmid standard, the EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay was developed using the primer pair qPCR-F/R. The final PCR reaction volume was 20 \u03bcL, which included 5 \u00d7 Golden HS EvaGreen qPCR Mix (4 \u03bcL), ROX reference Dye\u2161 (0.4 \u03bcL), plasmid template (1 \u03bcL) or cDNA (3 \u03bcL), 10 \u03bcM primer pair (1 \u03bcL), and deionized water.

The detection results were judged in accordance with the following rules (i) when the cycle threshold (Ct) value of samples detected by the assay was less than or equal to 35, the samples were considered FCoV positive; (ii) when the Ct value was more than 38, the samples were considered FCoV negative; (iii) when the Ct value was between 35 and 38, the samples should be evaluated repeatedly, and if the Ct value was above 38, the result was judged FCoV negative; otherwise, it was positive.",

Generally, FCoV comprises two biotypes, FECVs that inhabit the feline intestine and are associated with asymptomatic, persistent enteric infections, and FIPVs, which arise from FECVs by mutation causing feline infectious peritonitis in cats and can only be detected in the blood. Although the EvaGreen real-time RT-PCR assay developed in this study could not accurately distinguish FIPVs from FECVs (Fig. 4B), it can be used for screening FCoV infection in the affected cats. Additionally, the intra- and inter-assay reproducibility results exhibited a <0.5% coefficient of variation (Table 2\n), indicating improved reproducibility.",

As hyperglobulinemia is observed in approximately 90% of the cats afflicted with FIP [21], serum chemistry assays (including albumin: globulin and \u03b3-globulin) were introduced to increase the accuracy of clinical diagnosis. As shown in Table 3\n, a total of 189 FIPV-positive feline blood samples were detected by the real-time RT-PCR assay, and the rate of FIPV infection in cats was approximately 12%, indicating a serious epidemic. Maybe, the prevalence would be less than 12% due to the real-time RT-PCR assay developed in this study could not accurately differentiate FIPV and FECV. Additionally, in accordance with established criteria that allow for the determination of FIP-associated hyperglobulinemia (albumin: globulin <0.8 and \u03b3-globulin >2.5 g/dL), we tested all feline blood samples and observed a positive rate of approximately 10%. Among these blood samples, 124 samples collected from the diseased cats suspected of wet-form feline infectious peritonitis with the clinical symptoms of abdominal distension and ascites production were all positive detected by the real-time RT-PCR assay and the serum chemistry assays, showing a 100% coincidence rate. However, the total positive rate of these 1523 blood samples detected by the serum chemistry assay was lower than that of the EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay. This may be attributed to the entry of the FCoV mutant into the blood circulation that ultimately resulted in FIPV viremia during the early stage of viral infection, as at this stage, hyperglobulinemia had not yet developed [8,24,25]. Thus, at this stage the FIPV infection in cats could only be detected by the real-time RT-PCR assay and not by the serum chemistry assay. However, FIP-mediated hyperglobulinemia can be detected as the disease progressed. Therefore, combining the real-time RT-PCR assay with the serum chemistry assay could be helpful to screen FCoV infection in cats at different stages of infection, while the definitive diagnosis of FIPV infection should rely on the immunohistochemical staining of viral antigen in the macrophages or monocytes of the affected cats [26].",
