Methods Study 1 randomly assigned healthy adults to 0.5% carbomer 980 gel (n = 20) or placebo (n = 10) administered intranasally four times daily for 7 days. Nasal examinations were conducted at baseline and daily throughout the study. The primary endpoint was local nasal tolerability. Study 2 randomly assigned adults with an investigator-confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic common cold to 0.5% carbomer 980 gel (n = 87) or placebo (n = 81), administered intranasally four times daily for 7 days (except for day 1, where subjects who received their first dose mid-day administered only three doses). The primary efficacy endpoint was the average nasal symptom score over days 1-4 (ANSS 1-4 ). Secondary efficacy endpoints included ANSS over days 1-7 and average total symptom score (ATSS). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. Results In study 1, subjects assigned to 0.5% carbomer 980 gel had no mucosal grading higher than grade 1B (superficial nasal mucosal erosion) and low incidences of mucosal bleeding and crusting. In study 2, there were no statistically significant differences between treatments for any efficacy endpoints. Active treatment was well-tolerated; the most commonly reported AEs were headache, myalgia, and cough. Conclusion While 0.5% carbomer 980 gel nasal spray demonstrated good local nasal tolerability in healthy volunteers, the spray did not significantly impact the course of infection or resolution of cold symptoms in subjects with common cold.",

It is caused by a number of pathogens, although coronaviruses and rhinoviruses are among the most prevalent [2] . Although the pathophysiological mechanisms of these viruses may differ, it is believed that many common cold symptoms are mediated through the release of proinflammatory substances in response to viral infection [3, 4] . Rather than targeting viral infection and proliferation, most current treatments for the common cold are directed at individual symptoms, such as congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, fever, sore throat, and cough [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

Carbomer gels have been studied as a component of microbicides for prevention of transmission of other infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections [13] [14] [15] .

Nasal examinations were conducted at baseline (day 1) prior to the first administration and daily through day 8 by blinded evaluators.

The failure to demonstrate any clinical benefit in the efficacy study was not likely due to a lack of statistical power, as a sample size of 150-200 subjects was considered sufficient based on prior studies using products with a similar proposed mechanism of action [16] [17] [18] . The results were flat (i.e., not even a trend in favor of 0.5% carbomer). The NSS and TSS, which comprised the primary and secondary endpoints of the efficacy study, have been widely used in studies of allergic rhinitis and have been shown to be sensitive tools [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . These scores have been less extensively used in the common cold, but their use in some studies has demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms [5, 18, [24] [25] [26] . While the common cold is generally more prevalent in colder months, it can occur all year round. It is therefore possible that the lack of clinical benefit of carbomer 980 in our study may be due to the seasonal variability of the pathogens responsible for the common cold [27, 28] . For example, rhinoviruses, which are among the predominate causes of the common cold [1, 2] , are genetically diverse and appear to circulate with seasonal variation [27] . Moreover, although subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis were excluded, subjects with springtime allergies may not have mentioned them, particularly since screening for study 2 began in winter, when seasonal allergies are not top of mind [1, 2, 27] .",

Cold symptoms typically peak by the third day of illness and then begin to decline [29] . Considering that, once activated, the inflammatory response continues and prolongs cold symptoms even when viral replication is reduced [29] , preventing viral attachment and replication once cold symptoms are well-established may not be an effective strategy. It is also possible that preventing further viral replication with 0.5% carbomer 980 gel nasal spray would have been more effective at preventing or reducing symptoms if given earlier in the course of illness. In addition, the natural decline in cold symptoms after 72 h of illness may have made it difficult to detect differences between the 0.5% carbomer 980 gel nasal spray and placebo groups. The 0.5% carbomer 980 gel nasal spray was well-tolerated in both study populations: healthy volunteers (study 1) and adults with symptoms of common cold (study 2). Across the two studies, the incidence of TEAEs was lower in the active treatment arm than in the placebo arm. Multiple administrations of 0.5% carbomer 980 gel were welltolerated with regard to local nasal tolerability, with no mucosal grading higher than grade 1B and low incidences of mild mucosal bleeding and crusting. The use of a conservative grading scale in the local nasal tolerability study likely led to a higher reporting of nasal irritation than observed in the efficacy study. Overall, most AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The only serious AE that occurred in either study was unrelated to study treatment. Laboratory variables, vital signs, and physical examinations did not reveal any clinically significant effects of 0.5% carbomer 980 gel treatment.",
