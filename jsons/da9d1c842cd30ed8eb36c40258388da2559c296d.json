A retrospective, multicenter cohort study published in Lancet found hypertension to be the most common comorbidity among patients with COVID-19. Of 191 patients with COVID-19 in their study, 58 (30%) had a past medical history of hypertension. This is unsurprising given the general prevalence of hypertension. However, among other comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease, and chronic kidney disease, hypertension was most significantly associated with mortality (P \u00bc 0.0008). Only coronary heart disease was found to be more statistically significant in its association with mortality (P < 0.0001) [2] .",

It is understood that SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on type II pneumocytes in the lungs. Human ACE2 appears to be both necessary and sufficient for SARS-CoV entry [3] . ACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase known for cleaving substrates as part of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE2 functions diffusely across epithelia to indirectly maintain systemic blood pressure. However, its levels are inherently low in the lungs [4] . Consequently, soluble ACE2 may be used to competitively intercept SARS-CoV-2 and prevent viral entry at the respiratory epithelium.",

Second, the expression of ACE2 is increased in those with certain medical conditions (e.g. type I or type II diabetes mellitus) or in those being treated with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazolidi-nediones, and ibuprofen [6] .
