The absence of HV1 in these six species could be explained by low HV1 abundance, by loss of the HV1 gene in the species, or by a bona fide HV1 that does not fit our current profile.

In eight species, HV1 sequences from two or three of the different subfamilies appear in the same organism, strong evidence that these sequences represent different genes, although we cannot rule out alternative splicing or inaccurate transcript assembly. In humans, HV1 appears in three alternatively spliced forms that result in two different protein sequences, designated short and long (Hondares et al. 2014). The short protein results from splicing out the first intron (i.e. the first 20 residues of the protein) leaving the rest of the sequence identical to the long form. In contrast, alternative forms of HV1 in dinoflagellates differ in several sequence locations (Fig. 1), indicating that any alternative splicing would be more complex than for human HV1.",

Preliminary phylogenetic trees (data not shown) placed HV1 sequences from chromerids (considered to be dinoflagellates\u2019 closest relatives) and coccolith (HV1 from which have been experimentally verified (Taylor et al. 2011)) basal to the Group 1 subfamily; for simplicity we retained just the chromerid HV1 sequences as the outgroup. The HV1 from Oxyrrhis marina, the species considered basal to the dinoflagellate phylogeny (Bachvaroff et al. 2014; Janou\u0161kovec et al. 2017; Orr et al. 2012), was always basal to the Group 1 subfamily. Many Group 2 species are \u201cdinotoms\u201d; diatom HV1s cluster basal to Group 2, suggesting that HV1 from nominally dinoflagellate transcriptomes in this subfamily could instead be symbiont or prey sequences. In the other subfamilies, sequences from autotrophs cluster with nonautotrophic sequences, providing confidence that these are bona fide dinoflagellate HV1s. As shown in Fig. 1A and in Table S1, the major division of HV1 sequences does not correlate with a species\u2019 bioluminescence, theca, trophic type, or geographical origin (Fig. 1).",

These 11 sites appear in both external and internal aqueous vestibules, and in the hydrophobic gasket region of the protein (Fig. 1C). For six of these (represented by K. veneficum HV1 [kHV1] sequence numbers H41, G58, A105, E109, L126, H140), the side chain characteristics change dramatically, e.g. from positive to negative or from charged to hydrophobic (Fig. 1C).

In coccolithophores, HV1 at the plasma membrane mediates H+ conductance regulating cytoplasmic pH and promoting sustained calcification (Taylor et al. 2011). In several cell types from multicellular organisms, HV1 is important for controlling cytoplasmic pH (DeCoursey, 2013).
