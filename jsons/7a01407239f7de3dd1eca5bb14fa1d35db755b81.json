            "text": "A conventional method for assessing the DNA or RNA unwinding activity of helicase involves substrates that are double-stranded nucleic acids, one of which is radiolabeled with 32 P. The degree of substrate unwinding by helicase can be estimated by using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and subsequent visualization of the radioisotope. [5] However, the conventional assay is time-consuming and inefficient because of the lengthy preparation time for radiolabeled substrates, which have limited shelf life, and for running PAGE. In addition, the assay method assumes that unwound single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) will not undergo reannealing to the complementary strand and that any reannealed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which consists of trap DNA and previously unwound complementary DNA, will not participate in the helicase reaction as substrate. [6] Overall, the conventional assay method is not adequate for multiple-turnover helicase reactions or parallel activity screenings. To date, several other strategies for the assay of helicase activity have been developed, based on enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), [7] fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), [8] or chemiluminescence. [9] These newer approaches partly overcome the limitations of the conventional assay but still possess undesirable features, such as high cost and laborious procedure, which prohibit their routine implementation.",

Previously, GO was reported to interact strongly with nucleotides through p-stacking interaction between the ring structures in the nucleobases and the hexagonal cells of GO, whereas dsDNA cannot be stably adsorbed onto the GO surface because of efficient shielding of nucleobases within the negatively charged phosphate backbone of dsDNA. [10] In addition, GO is known to efficiently quench the fluorescence of nearby organic dyes. [11] The helicase assay based on GO starts with the preparation of a dsDNA substrate containing a fluorescent dye at the end of one strand. To initiate the helicase reaction, helicase is added to a mixture of dsDNA and GO in which the dsDNA exhibits intense fluorescence. As the helicase-induced unwinding of dsDNA proceeds, the fluorescence decreases because of strong interaction of GO with unwound ssDNA, which results in fluorescence quenching by GO ( Figure 1 ).",

[12] SARS is a fatal infectious disease that develops flulike symptoms and has a high mortality rate. SCV helicase has been recognized as a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs against SARS. [13] A dsDNA substrate of SCV helicase was designed based on a previous report. [14] We first prepared GO according to a modified Hummers method. [15] To confirm the successful formation of a singlelayered GO sheet, the prepared GO was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The sheet width and thickness (height) of GO were approximately 0.1-3 mm (with a few sheets larger than 4 mm) and 1.4 nm, respectively ( Figure 2 a,b) . [16] The chemical structure of GO was characterized by both IR and Raman spectroscopy. Several characteristic peaks of functional groups containing oxygen were observed in the IR spectrum of GO, including peaks at 1716 and 1079 cm \u00c01 that resulted from C=O and C\u00c0O stretching, respectively (Figure 2 c). Strong D-band absorption at 1350 cm \u00c01 appeared in the Raman spectrum of GO (Figure 2 d) . Taken together, these data support the premise that single-layered GO sheets were successfully prepared.",

Separate mixtures containing GO (0.5 mg mL \u00c01 ) and either annealed F-dsDNA or F-ssDNA were prepared in helicase reaction buffer (pH 8.0 buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.65 mm MgCl 2 , and 10 % glycerol), and the fluorescence emission spectra of the mixtures were then measured over time. The F-dsDNA showed strong fluorescence around 520 nm, regardless of the presence of GO. However, a mixture of F-ssDNA and GO showed up to % 92 % quenching of fluorescence after 10 minutes at room temperature, as a result of the interaction of GO with ssDNA (Figure 3 a) . The dsDNA is expected to have repulsive interaction with GO because of the negative charges on GO (zeta potential of GO: \u00c024.89 mV) and the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA. Quenching of fluores-cence did take place over time in the F-dsDNA mixture, but the fluorescence reached a plateau at a relatively high level after 10 minutes (Figure 3 b). In contrast, GO quenched nearly all of the fluorescence of F-ssDNA because of its selective interaction with ssDNA as compared to dsDNA under the experimental conditions employed.",

Two compounds, 5'-adenylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) and doxorubicin (also known as hydroxydaunorubicin), were chosen as model inhibitors of helicase. AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, was previously reported to inhibit helicase activity by competing for the ATP binding site. [17] Doxorubicin, an anticancer agent, intercalates with duplex DNA, thereby slowing down the unwinding of dsDNA. [18] We began with reaction mixtures containing helicase (10 nm), F-dsDNA (100 nm), GO (1 mg mL \u00c01 ), ATP (10 mm), and various concentrations of the inhibitors in helicase reaction buffer. In the case of doxorubicin, mixtures of F-dsDNA and doxorubicin were prepared and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature, prior to mixing with the other reagents, to ensure the intercalation of doxorubicin with F-dsDNA without interference from the other components. The change in fluorescence intensity at 520 nm was then measured for 30 minutes at 37 8C for each of the reaction mixtures.",

In contrast, the present GObased method (Figure 6 a, bottom) shows that unwinding of dsDNA was completed within 10 minutes under similar conditions even in the absence of trap DNA. This result indicates that the GO-based method substantiates a condition for preventing reannealing of the unwound ssDNA by capturing the displaced ssDNA efficiently. Reannealing of the unwound ssDNA causes less accumulation of ssDNA products at a given time than that performed in the presence of an appropriate trap molecule. Thus, the absence of trap DNA is not adequate to reflect accumulation of ssDNA products. More importantly, the conventional gel-based DNA unwinding assay is simply an all-or-none method that reports only the completely unwound ssDNA product, whereas the GO method can report progress of dsDNA unwinding in real time. Because an excess of trap DNA is needed for precise measurement in the conventional assay method, the cost of the assay is increased substantially, thus hampering the use of parallel assays and multiple samples. In contrast, the present method is a fluorescence-based assay, which can be monitored in real time under various reaction conditions.",

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize GO for an enzyme activity assay. The GO-based platform has several advantages over the conventional method. First, the helicase activity can be monitored in real time by following the change in fluorescence, without requiring any additional steps or reagents. Second, the GO-based assay is costeffective compared to the conventional assay, which demands expensive isotope labeling and trap DNA. The GO, a critical component in the present method, can be prepared in large quantities from graphite available at very low cost. Third, the prepared GO has a much longer shelf life than 32 P, which has a half-life of only 14 days. Under ambient conditions, GO can be stored for months in the form of a suspended aqueous solution, or considerably longer in powder form. Fourth, the present method makes high-throughput screening feasible. As shown in Figure 5 , fluorescence imaging of multiple samples makes possible parallel assays, without the need for any further purification or resolving steps. Therefore, this platform can be easily applied to any high-throughput analysis system. We expect that this method will be readily applicable to any research involving duplex-DNA unwinding, and to the screening of helicase inhibitors as drug candidates in antivirus therapy. Such studies will benefit from the methods quantitativeness, cost-effectiveness, and technical simplicity.",
