            "text": "\nFerrets (Mustela putorius furo) belong to the ancient family Mustelidae, which is believed to date back to the Eocene period, some 40 million years ago. The taxonomic groups in the family Mustelidae, as recognized by Nowak (1999), include 67 species in 25 genera from North, Central, and South America; Eurasia; and Africa. No other carnivore shows such diversity of adaptation, being found in a wide variety of ecosystems ranging from arctic tundra to tropical rainforests. Mustelids have retained many primitive characteristics, which include relatively small size, short stocky legs, five toes per foot, elongated braincase, and short rostrum (Anderson, 1989). The Mustelinae is the central subfamily of the Mustelidae. The best-known members of the Mustelinae are the weasels, mink, ferrets (genus Mustela), and the martens (genus Martes) (Anderson, 1989). The genus Mustela is divided into five subgenera: Mustela (weasels), Lutreola (European mink), Vison (American mink), Putorius (ferrets), and Grammogale (South American weasels). The smallest member of the Mustelidae family is the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), which weighs as little as 25 g, and the largest member is the sea otter (Enhydra lutris), which can weigh as much as 45 kg (Nowak, 1999).\n",

Earlier references to ferrets are probably the basis of the belief that ferrets originated in North Africa (Thomson, 1951). Evidently they were bred specifically for rabbiting (rabbit hunting) and were muzzled before being sent into rabbit burrows. This practice was later introduced into Europe, Asia, and the British Isles, where the sport is still practiced today.",

Early studies utilized the ferret in classic experiments with influenza virus pathogenesis (Pyle, 1940). Its use was cited infrequently; an article published in 1940, detailing the use of ferrets in research, cited only 26 publications (Pyle, 1940). Literature reviews undertaken in 1967, 1969, 1973, and 1985, however, revealed an increasing appreciation for the ferret\u2019s usefulness and versatility in the study of human physiologic, anatomic, and disease mechanisms (Hahn and Wester, 1969, Marshall and Marshall, 1973, Shump et al., 1974, Frederick and Babish, 1985). In 1991, a bibliography containing \u2018selected\u2019 literature citations on the ferret and its use in biomedical research was published (Clingerman et al., 1991). The document was designed to serve as a reference tool for individuals involved in the care or use of ferrets in the laboratory setting. Although not comprehensive, the document provides extensive coverage of ferret biology, diseases, and use as an animal model. The domesticated ferret has been and continues to be used extensively in studies involving virology, neuroscience, carcinogenesis, cardiovascular physiology, and emesis (Morgan and Travers, 1998). An extensive overview of different uses of the ferret as an animal model has been compiled by the USDA. It contains more than 30 publications and was last updated in 2006.

            "text": "The ferret\u2019s increasing popularity in research and as a pet is mainly a result of large-scale commercial production. Commercial farms have been raising ferrets for almost 50 years. Biomedical researchers in the United States can request animals of a specific sex, weight, and age for individual experiments. Investigators in other countries may acquire ferrets from fur operations or may make arrangements with commercial vendors in the United States. Even though the ferret is nonstandardized with regard to exact genotype and pedigree, its routine availability in a clinically healthy state has aided immeasurably its acceptance as a research animal. Readily available commercial stocks, based on coat color, are albino, sable (or fitch), Siamese, silver mitt, and Siamese-silver mitt (Siamese with white chest and feet) (McLain et al., 1985). The fitch or so-called wild coat color is the most common, recognized by yellow\u2013buff fur with patches of black or dark brown, particularly on the tail and limbs (Andrews and Illman, 1987). The production of ferrets by large commercial operations has raised concern by some that inbreeding of these animals has made the ferret more susceptible to diseases, e.g., endocrine-related disorders. Anecdodally, it has been suggested that 75% of US ferrets with a blaze or white head can suffer from the Waardenburg syndrome and are deaf (J. Mayer, personal observation). The only study providing a physiologic basis for auditory impairment describes a reduction in the ipsilateral projections of the cochlear nucleus to the auditory midbrain in albino ferrets (Moore and Kowalchuk, 1988). Albino ferrets also have impaired motion perception and contrast sensitivity (Hoffmann et al., 2004; Price and Morgan, 1987; Akerman et al., 2003; Hupfeld et al., 2006).",

Elevated temperatures (>30\u00b0C; 86\u00b0F) cannot be tolerated by ferrets, because they have poorly developed sweat glands and are susceptible to heat prostration.

            "text": "Molded plastic caging used to house rabbits works very well for ferrets. The solid bottom is perforated with holes and is readily sanitizable. An absorbable paper liner may be used in the pan beneath the cage to facilitate daily disposal of urine and feces. In a research setting, the plastic caging should be washed weekly to avoid excessive soiling. Use of one or two additional pieces of cage board or similar substance within the cage also helps maintain cleanliness, and ferrets enjoy burrowing beneath and between the sheets of paper. The spacing of grid walls should be 1.0 \u00d7 0.5 inches apart, or 0.25 inch if using wire mesh. Ferrets like to lick and bite at their enclosures, so sharp edges and galvanized metal should be avoided. Fractured teeth are often a consequence if this behavior is not corrected. Zinc toxicosis has been reported from licking galvanized bars from which metals had leached during steam sterilization (Straube and Walden, 1981) (Table 14.1\n) Ferrets can be trained to use a litter box because they repeatedly urinate or defecate in one corner of the cage. Clay litters have been reported to cause chronic upper respiratory irritation from inhaled dust (Jenkins and Brown, 1993). Ferrets prefer sleeping in a soft isolated area, and in a research facility this can be accomplished by providing a washable \u2018snooze tube\u2019 or hammock (Fox, 1998c). Environmental enrichment is now commonly used in order to prevent boredom or misplaced reactions towards cagemates. Some studies suggest that the lack of environmental stumuli has potentially wide-ranging effects on the overall well-being of ferrets. Chivers and Einon (1982) found that some of the isolation-induced effects on behavior seen in rats also occurred in ferrets, with deprivation of rough and tumble social play causing hyperactivity that persisted into adulthood. Socially reared ferrets whose environment was enriched with a series of changing tube systems (Weiss-Buerger, 1981) were superior in maze learning and reversal. Korhonen (1995) demonstrated that optimal health occurred when ferrets were provided with increased floor space and compatible cagemates and when offered balls and bite cups with which to play. Russell (1990) found that ferrets raised in enriched conditions would choose the arm of a maze leading to the more prey-like of two play objects and were superior in capturing prey-models. These forms of enrichment are easy to implement and carry a minimal risk of injury to the animal. Examples of enrichment ideas include making tunnels from PCV pipe or dryer hose, and filling a box with rice, plastic balls, or crumpled paper balls, in order to let the ferrets fulfill their instinctive digging behaviors. All these items can easily be sterilized or exchanged between uses. Care must be taken that the enrichment items are not ingested by the ferret. Foreign body ingestion in ferrets is usually a true medical emergency.",

The tracheal size and laryngeal anatomy make endotracheal intubation somewhat challenging, and as a result the ferret has been advocated as a species suitable for use in pediatric intubation training (Powell et al., 1991). The lungs are relatively large, and the total lung capacity is nearly three-times that which would be predicted based on body size, as compared with other mammals. This characteristic, together with a higher degree of bronchiolar branching and more extensive bronchial submucosal glands (as compared with the dog), makes the ferret an attractive model for pulmonary research studies (Vinegar et al., 1985). Although a previous report (Willis and Barrow, 1971) commented that the carotid arterial branching pattern in the ferret is unusual, it is actually typical for a carnivore. As is the case in the dog and the cat, the paired common carotid arteries arise from the brachiocephalic trunk (sometimes called the innominate artery) at the level of the thoracic inlet (Andrews et al., 1979b).",

One distinctive hematological characteristic of the ferret is the presence of a relatively robust erythron, characterized by hematocrit, hemoglobin, and total erythrocyte and reticulocyte counts that are generally higher than those of the dog or cat. Reported neutrophil\u2013lymphocyte ratios range from 1.7:1 to 0.7:1. Representative hematology and chemistry ranges of pet ferrets have recently been published and are listed in Table 14.5\n(Hein et al., 2012). While these values are reliable and complete for diagnostic purposes, any laboratory that evaluates ferret samples should develop its\nown set of specific normal ranges. A low-grade proteinuria may be identified by urinalysis in normal, healthy ferrets (Thornton et al., 1979) (Table 14.6\n).

Available commercial diets are certainly capable of supporting growth, reproduction, and maintenance in conventional settings. In recent years speciality diets designed for ferrets have entered the commercial market. Some of these diets contain extremely high crude protein contents (up to ~50%) and low charbohydrate values (<10%) in order to try to mimic a more natural composition of a whole-prey diet. Other speciality foods are considered hypoallergenic as they are made with turkey, venison, and lamb, and contain no chicken. In the absence of careful analysis, however, it is uncertain whether the proportion and quantity of ingredients in these diets is optimal or even beneficial.",

The use of any raw chicken, beef, or other meats is strongly discouraged because of the potential contamination by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Listeria, Mycobacterium, and Streptococcus (Fox, 1998a). The daily maintenance energy requirement of the ferret is estimated to be 0.5 MJ metabolizable energy (ME)/kg metabolic body weight (BW0.75; Kamphues et al., 1999).

After 16 weeks, ratios of 17 and 21, corresponding to 36% and 26% protein, respectively, were recommended. Diets containing 9\u201328% fat and 22\u201342% carbohydrate have been used successfully to maintain ferrets. One author recommends 30\u201340% protein and 18\u201320% fat for adult, nonbreeding animals and a minimum of 35% protein and 25% fat for reproductively active animals and those that have not reached sexual maturity (Brown, 1997a). The long-term impact of diets containing high levels of fat and protein are unknown. A recent study demonstrates that the digestibility of crude protein in ferrets is significantly lower than in cats while the digestibility of crude fat is significantly higher (Fekete et al., 2005). The study concludes that the ferret cannot be used as a model animal for cats with respect to either feed preference or nutrient digestibility and care must be taken when extrapolating data obtained from feline research to the ferret.",

Ferrets, like humans, convert \u03b2-carotene to vitamin A in the gut and absorb \u03b2-carotene intact (Fox and McLain, 1998). In intestinal perfusion experiments in ferrets, it was demonstrated that \u03b2-carotene, retinol, and retinyl esters are absorbed intact into lymph and that cleavage products, including \u03b2-apo-12\u2032-carotenal, \u03b2-apo-10\u2032-carotenal, and retinoids, accumulate in the intestinal mucosa (Wang et al., 1992). The intestinal mucosa is capable of converting \u03b2-carotene into retinoic acid and other polar metabolites, which are then transported via the portal vein to the liver (Wang et al., 1993). \u03b2-Carotene absorption is enhanced by co-perfusion with \u03b1-tocopherol, and the perfusion of the latter is unaltered by the presence of \u03b2-carotene. The conversion of \u03b2-carotene into retinol is also enhanced by the presence of \u03b1-tocopherol (Wang et al., 1995). Studies have shown that ferrets have the capacity to excrete retinol and retinyl esters in the urine. This response seems dependent on oral vitamin A supplementation (Raila et al., 2002). Based on the various studies available, it can be concluded that the ferret can be used as a model to investigate aspects of beta-carotene metabolism as well as aspects of the metabolism of vitamin A such as absorption in the gut, regulation of incorporation of retinyl esters into lipoproteins in the liver, and renal uptake and regulated urinary excretion of vitamin A.",

The season under natural illumination in the Northern Hemisphere is from March to August for females and from December to July for males, corresponding temporally to increasing day length. Ferrets born in the late spring or early summer and maintained under natural lighting will not assume an adult pattern of gonadal activity (i.e., puberty) until the following season (Baum, 1998). Under artificial illumination, jills that are maintained at 8 h light\u201316 h dark reach puberty at 10\u201312 months. Stimulatory photoperiods may be used, however, in the laboratory or intensive production setting, as a method of breeding ferrets out of the natural season. However, the transfer from short to long photoperiods should not occur prior to 90 days of age, because jills that are prematurely transferred will remain anestrous (Hammond and Chesterman, 1972). Management practices in one breeding facility are such that jills commence breeding at 7\u201310 months, average 3.7 litters a year, and are cycled out of reproduction after six litters. In another strategy, ferrets are exposed to a 16:8 h photoperiod at 12 weeks of age, are bred at 16 weeks during their first estrus, and whelp at 5\u00bd months.",

The ease with which estrus is detected in the ferret, as well as the size of the ferret and ease of its maintenance in captivity have made the ferret a model for study of neuroendocrine events and their gonadal correlates. Along with the hamster, the ferret has contributed extensively to an understanding of the photoperiodic influences on the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis (Baum, 1998). As in females of other species, estradiol concentrations are responsible for controlling the development of the female reproductive tract and secondary sexual characteristics, and the tonic inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by the anterior pituitary during both prepubertal life and anestrus. The sensitivity of the hypothalamic gonadostat to negative feedback inhibition by estradiol changes at the time of puberty, and under the influence of increasing light exposure, LH levels rise despite estradiol (Ryan, 1984). Similarly, age differences in the sensitivity of negative feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by testosterone, or to estrogenic compounds derived from the aromatization of testosterone, appear to be essential in determining puberty and seasonality of reproduction in the male (Baum, 1998).",

            "text": "Estrus in jills is characterized by dramatic vulvar swelling from an anestrous diameter of 5\u201316 mm to an estrous diameter of 17\u201333 mm. Changes in vaginal cytology have also been described for the ferret and other mustelid species, but these changes are seldom used to determine onset of estrus or to schedule breeding (Williams et al., 1992). After a 2- to 3-week proestrus, estrus occurs. Estrus onset is not associated with elevated serum FSH in the ferret, as it is in the rodent. Once estrus has occurred, it may terminate in coitus-induced ovulation and pregnancy, pseudopregnancy after infertile mating, pharmacologic termination (by injection of human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], GnRH or GnRH analogs), death due to estrogen-induced aplastic anemia, or spontaneous remission and anestrus due to reduced photoperiod. Waves of follicular development occur in estrus, and five to 13 ova are ovulated approximately 30\u201340 h after coitus. Female ferrets are brought to the male approximately 14 days after vulvar enlargement. Females and males copulate many times and for prolonged periods of time; they are typically left together for 2 days. Both intromission and neck restraint by the male are apparently required for induction of ovulation (Baum, 1998). An LH surge accompanies coitus in females, but the same is not true of males (Carroll et al., 1987). Implantation occurs 12 days after mating; both a functional corpus luteum and the anterior pituitary are required for implantation and maintenance of pregnancy. Placentation is typical of carnivores and is zonary and endotheliochorial (Morrow, 1980). Pregnancy may be detected by ultrasonographic demonstration of 3- to 5-mm discrete nonechogenic structures as early as day 12 (Peter et al., 1990), by palpation as early as day 14, or by radiographic demonstration of calcified fetal skeletons at approximately 30 days of gestation.",

When rabbit cages are used for housing, nest boxes may take the form of polypropylene rat cages or other plastic boxes (cat litter box or dish pan). Nest boxes should have bedding provided for warmth and comfort. Materials suitable for bedding include pieces of fabric (towels), ripped cageboard, shredded paper, or cotton batting. The nest box should be at least 6 inches deep and should prevent the kits from wandering from the jill. Entrance to the nest box should be smooth, to avoid injury to the teats and mammary gland. At our institution, jills are provided a stainless steel rectangular box with a smooth-surfaced plastic entrance (Fig. 14.1\n). A retractable steel roof panel and a guillotine side panel exposing a Plexiglas sidewall allow access to the jill and permit observation with minimal disturbance. One major supplier of ferrets uses sunken tubs filled with bedding to promote a sense of security and isolation of the jill. Most jills will leave the nest box to eat and drink. If the jill will not leave, however, low-sided food bowls should be placed within the nest box. Adequate nutritional care for the pregnant jill is of utmost importance, as during pregnancy the ferret fetuses have a large glucose demand that must be satisfied by the mother. If the fetal demand and the maternal supply become imbalanced due to fasting of the mother or increased nutritional demands of the rapidly developing fetal placental unit, females suffer from negative energy balance and succumb to severe hypoglycemia (Batchelder et al., 1999, Dalrymple, 2004). Prohaczik et al. (2009) describe in detail the metabolic changes which occur during pregnancy toxemia and how to monitor for them. Their findings showed that in contrast to healthy animals, hypoglycemia, hyperketonemia, hypoinsulinemia, and decreased T4 and T3 levels were detected in females with pregnancy toxemia. Necropsy showed excessive hepatic lipidosis (Batchelder et al., 1999, Dalrymple, 2004, Prohaczik et al., 2009).",

Primiparous jills typically deliver on day 41 of gestation whereas multiparous jills deliver on day 42. There are few signs of impending parturition, although abdominal enlargement and mammary development do occur in the last week or two. Small litters (fewer than three) may result in inadequate stimulus for parturition. Jills that pass their due date without delivery should be palpated for fetuses. Kits remaining in utero beyond the 43rd day typically die; kits with congenital malformations such as cyclopia and exencephaly may also delay the initiation of labor. Dystocia is common in ferrets because of positional abnormalities and fetal oversize and should be treated by cesarean section. Jills tolerate cesareans well and will nurse kits delivered in this way. If small litter size is responsible for delayed parturition, prostaglandins (0.5\u20131.0 mg Lutalyse) may be used, followed by 0.3 ml oxytocin (6 U) after 3 h (Fox and Bell, 1998). Failure to deliver within 8 h of administration of prostaglandin is an indication for cesarean section. Jills should be provided heat, energy, hydration, and analgesia following cesarean.",

This late onset of hearing may explain why kits produce exceptionally loud, piercing sounds during the first 4 weeks of life. Lactating jills are tuned in to kit vocalizations and will respond to high-frequency (greater than 16 kHz) sounds in a maze test, whereas males and nonlactating females will ignore these sounds (Shimbo, 1992).

In the laboratory setting, when jills are maintained in a nonstimulatory photoperiod (8 h light\u201316 h dark) for 6\u20138 weeks, followed by reversal of the cycle (16 h light\u20138 h dark), estrus will follow in 4 weeks (immature jills) or 3 weeks (mature jills) after the change (Carroll et al., 1985).

In humans, epidemiologic data strongly support the association between H. pylori and development of gastric adenocarcinoma. Similarly, we have recently documented a series of H. mustelae-infected ferrets with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma that parallels the same syndrome found in humans. Lymphoma was diagnosed in the wall of the lesser curvature of the pyloric antrum, corresponding to the predominant focus of H. mustelae-induced gastritis in ferrets. Gastric lymphomas demonstrated characteristic lymphoepithelial lesions, and the lymphoid cells were IgG positive in all ferrets (Erdman et al., 1997).

Natural infections with Mycobacterium bovis and M. avium have been reported in the ferret (de Lisle et al., 2008; Saunders and Thomsen, 2006). Ferrets are also susceptible to experimental infection with human tubercle bacillus. Most reports of tuberculosis in ferrets are in animals that were used for research in England and the rest of Europe between the years of 1929 to 1953 and were likely related to the feeding of raw poultry, raw meat, and unpasteurized milk to ferrets during this time (Fox, 1998a). In New Zealand the prevalence rate in the endemic area for M. bovis was 17.9% for feral ferrets (n = 548) (Ragg et al., 1995a) The feeding of commercially prepared diets and widespread tuberculosis testing and elimination in livestock and poultry have resulted in the reduced incidence of the disease in ferrets. Mycobacterium avium-infected wild birds shed the organism in feces; prevention of contamination of food and outdoor housing areas of ferrets is warranted. Horizontal transmission of M. bovis infection was demonstrated in ferrets under experimental housing conditions. Several behavioral interactions were observed that could result in M. bovis transmission, including den sharing, playing, fighting, sniffing of orifices and faeces, cannibalism, and aggressive breeding behavior (Qureshi et al., 2000).",

Salmonella are properly designated using their serovar (which was often a species name formerly), so, for example, S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (aka S.

Several Salmonella serovars have been isolated from mink with gastroenteritis and abortion (Gorham et al., 1949). Contaminated raw meat products were suspected as the source in one outbreak. S. Typhimurium was isolated in ferrets in an outbreak of clinical disease (Coburn and Morris, 1949) and several serotypes including S. Hadar, S. Enteritidis, S. Kentucky, and S.

Typhimurium of ferret origin included marked tissue pallor, petechiae in the gastric mucosa, and the presence of melena in one and a dark-colored fibrinous exudate in the large intestine of the other ferret (Coburn and Morris, 1949). Studies involving experimental inoculation with S. Enteritidis, S. Newport, and S. Choleraesuis via the oral route to healthy, distemper-infected, and feed-depleted ferrets and mink showed a fairly high resistance to infection (Gorham et al., 1949). Only two animals of 29 in the diet-restricted group \u2013 1 ferret and 1 mink \u2013 showed clinical signs of infection after feeding S. Newport culture. Signs included lethargy, anorexia, trembling, and fecal blood. The gastrointestinal tract showed a large amount of mucus containing red blood cells; bits of desquamated epithelium and few mononuclear cells overlying the gastric mucosa; an exudate in the small intestine consisting of mucoid material, red blood cells, and desquamated small intestinal villi; edematous villi in the ileum; and a diffuse infiltrate of the small intestinal mucosa with lymphocytes and macrophages. Necrotic foci in the liver, spleen, and, less commonly, the kidney, as well as splenomegaly and visceral lymphadenopathy, were observed in chronic fatal infections (Coburn and Morris, 1949). Abortion and gastroenteritis have been reported in mink (Gorham et al., 1949). A recent outbreak of Salmonella Dublin infection was recorded in a large number of Danish mink farms (Dietz et al., 2006). All of the affected farms suffered extensive disease problems; clinical and pathological observations included abortion, stillbirths, necrotizing endometritis, and increased mortality. The outbreaks took place mainly during April and May, around the time of whelping when the animals are very susceptible to Salmonella infections. The most common lesion at necropsy was a characteristic dark-red, very fragile uterus which correlated histologically with severe, necrotizing endometritis, often complicated with endometrial rupture and concurrent, diffuse, purulent peritonitis. The strain was identified as S. Dublin.",

A good example is bacterial pneumonia which occurs secondary to megaesophagus in the ferret. An influenza virus\u2013bacteria synergism has been the subject of several studies in ferrets (Fox, 1998a, McCullers et al., 2010). Debilitated and immunosuppressed animals and animals with concurrent diseases such as influenza may be more susceptible to bacterial pneumonias (Fox, 1998a, Mart\u00ednez et al., 2012, Kendrick, 2000, Peltola et al., 2006). One exception to this commonly seen secondary pneumonia is the description of an outbreak of severe respiratory disease associated with a novel Mycoplasma species in ferrets (Kiupel et al., 2012). This report describes an outbreak of respiratory disease characterized by a dry, nonproductive cough which was observed in 6- to 8-week-old ferrets. While almost 95% of the ferrets were affected, almost none died.",

Oral antibiotic administration to kits nursing on affected jills is recommended (Bell, 1997a). Supplementation of kits with milk replacer may also be necessary, because jills with acute mastitis are reluctant to nurse, and jills with the chronic form have diminished lactation as milk-producing tissue is replaced by scar tissue (Bell, 1997a). Surgical resection and debridement of affected glands and supportive care may be necessary for jills with acute mastitis. In the laboratory setting, in which foster mothers are often available, it is far more common to remove and foster the kits, after which jills are treated medically. When cross-fostering kits is required, kits may spread infection to healthy jills. Maintaining thorough personal hygiene practices when handling affected jills is important in minimizing spread to other lactating jills.

There are several strains, including a ferret-adapted strain of canine distemper virus (CDV), that differ in incubation, clinical signs, and duration (Fox et al., 1998b). The virus can be inactivated by heat, light, and various chemicals, including phenol, Roccal, sodium hydroxide, and formalin (Shen and Gorham, 1980, Budd, 1981). Infectious virions have been recovered from fomites after 20 min at room temperature. CD is the most serious viral infection of ferrets. Mortality approaches 100%, making appropriate husbandry and vaccination imperative (Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n et al., 2008).",

Instead, viral spread into the subarachnoid space in infected animals was triggered by infection of vascular endothelial cells and the hematogenous spread of virus-infected leukocytes from meningeal blood vessels into the subarachnoid space. This resulted in widespread infection of cells of the pia and arachnoid mater of the leptomeninges over large areas of the cerebral hemispheres (Ludlow et al., 2012).",

Humane euthanasia of affected animals is recommended due to the absence of any literature reports of an animal surviving active infection.

Kits should be vaccinated every 2\u20133 weeks, starting at age 6 weeks, until 14 weeks and annually thereafter (Fox et al., 1998b). It is important to adhere to the prescribed vaccination protocol, because ferret deaths have been reported following double-dose vaccination (Carpenter et al., 1976). Vaccine reactions manifest as vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and collapse. A report evaluating a large number of such reactions found an event rate of 1% for distemper administered as a sole vaccine. This incidence was associated with the cumulative number of distemper vaccines received (Moore et al., 2005). Diphendramine (0.5\u20132 mg/kg IV, IM) or epinephrine (20 \u03bcg/kg SQ, IV, IM, intratracheally) with standard supportive care should be initiated. Inactivated distemper vaccines do not elicit consistent, effective immunity and are not recommended. It is important to know the vaccination schedule of your ferret supplier and to vaccinate supplementally as appropriate.

Clinical signs and characteristic hematology are strongly suggestive. Typical hematology findings include nonregenerative anemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia. A polyclonal gammopathy exists and requires clinicans to rule out AD and other conditions in which hypergammablobulinemia can occur. Serum chemistry values will reflect specific organ involvement. Radiography and endoscopy can be useful in characterizing palpated masses (Garner et al., 2008, Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n and L\u00f3pez, 2008, Murray et al., 2010).",

Additionally, yeasts will stain with iodine and are not acid-fast, whereas Cryptosporidium has the opposite staining characteristics. The oocyst residuum is seen as a refractive dot under phase-contrast microscopy, a structure lacking in yeast (Kirkpatrick and Dubey, 1987). Sugar-solution centrifugation and fecal sedimentation using formalin-ether or formalin-ethyl acetate are effective diagnostic concentration techniques (Hill and Lappin, 1995). Oocysts may then be viewed with phase-contrast or bright-field microscopy of specimens stained with an acid-fast method.

Thereafter, three final treatments with 0.0375% amitraz every 5 days for the body, and every other day for the ears and tail, were administered. The ferrets were evaluated and skin scrapings were performed regularly during treatment and post-treatment to monitor response to therapy.

Efficacy was evaluated by microscopic evidence of ear mites in debris from aural swabs taken weekly for an 8-week period. Topical 1% ivermectin (Ivomec, Merck AgVet Division, Rahway, New Jersey), diluted 1:10 in propylene glycol at a dosage of 400 \u03bcg/kg body weight divided equally between the two ear canals and administered on days 1 and 14 of the study, was the most effective treatment. However, more recent publications suggest that because of the anatomical characteristics of the ear of the ferret, conventional treatment involving instillation of drops into the ear canal is of very limited efficacy (Fisher et al., 2007). A single topical application of approximately 15 mg/kg selamectin per ferret has been reported to be highly effective in the treatment of this irritant infestation. Another study showed that the combination of imidacloprid 10% + moxidectin 1% (Advocate\u00ae spot-on for small cats and ferrets) applied to ferrets naturally infested with O. cynotis achieved 100% cure after two or three treatments at 2-week intervals (Le Sueur et al., 2011).

The risk for indoor-housed ferrets appears low as cryptococcus is found in soil, bird droppings, and trees, which puts ferrets with outdoor access at an increased risk. The prognosis for this condition is guarded and treatment is usually difficult, but mimics current treatment suggested in dogs and cats. A case treated with itraconazole at 15 mg/kg PO q24 h for 10 months resulted in a successful outcome after the diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans variety grubii from an enlarged submandibular lymph node (Hanley et al., 2006).",

The dosage recommended for ferrets by the American Heartworm Society is 0.006 mg ivermectin per kg body weight monthly (Fox, 1998g). Housing ferrets indoors, particularly during the mosquito season, would help minimize exposure. Successful adulticide treatment in ferrets has been described and includes the administration of thiacetarsemide, with the same precautions used in dogs: antithrombotic therapy, treatment for heart failure, and strict cage confinement (Stamoulis et al., 1997). The current recommended treatment protocol for affected ferrets is ivermectin (50 \u03bcg/kg SC q30d) given until clinical signs resolve and microfilaremia is absent. Previous treatment protocols using adulticide therapy with melarsomine have fallen out of favor because of adverse reactions (Morrisey and Kraus, 2011). One should follow up with heartworm antigen tests until negative and resume heartworm prevention 1 month after adulticide treatment (Stamoulis et al., 1997). A ferret with clinically-apparent dirofilariasis was successfully treated via transvenous heartworm extraction (Bradbury et al., 2010).",

At least 75% of jills carrying more than eight kits will develop pregnancy toxemia if subjected to 24 h of food withdrawal in late gestation (Bell, 1997a, Batchelder et al., 1999). Any jill with 15 or more kits may develop pregnancy toxemia because abdominal space is not adequate for both the gravid uterus and the volume of food required to support it. Pregnancy toxemia of the ferret is of the metabolic type and shares features with similar conditions in pregnant sheep, obese cattle, pregnant camelids, obese guinea pigs, and starved pregnant rats, as well as with the condition feline idiopathic hepatic lipidosis. It is characterized by abnormal energy metabolism with consequent hyperlipidemia, hypoglycemia, ketosis, and hepatic lipidosis. In this condition, energy demand exceeds intake, leading to excessive mobilization of free fatty acids and a chain of metabolic events that culminates in a shift from fatty acid metabolism and export to ketosis and hepatic lipidosis. A study evaluating the metabolic and endocrine characteristics of pregnancy toxemia in ferrets showed that in contrast to healthy animals, hypoglycemia, hyperketonemia, hypoinsulinemia, and decreased T4 and T3 levels were detected in females with pregnancy toxemia. Necropsy showed excessive hepatic lipidosis (Prohaczik et al., 2009).",

Treatment for jills within a day of their due date should include cesarean section and intensive postoperative support, including force-feeding a gruel of high-quality cat food and ferret chow, nutritive pastes, intravenous fluids containing glucose, and supplemental heat. Ceasarean section should be performed under isoflurane or sevoflurane anesthesia because hepatic dysfunction prolongs the metabolism of injectable agents. Agalactia is common after cesarean section, and kits may require hand feeding with kitten or puppy milk replacers, administered per os by fine-tipped syringe six times daily for the first 24 h. Cross-fostering is an effective method of enhancing kit survival; hand rearing of kits if the jill fails to nurse within a day postoperatively is energy-consuming and generally unrewarding. For jills that develop pregnancy toxemia before day 40 of gestation, fluids and nutritional support must be provided until viable kits can be delivered by cesarean.",

            "text": "Ferrets are induced ovulators and may remain in persistent estrus if they are not bred or if estrus is not terminated chemically or via ovariohysterectomy (Bell, 1997a). Jills that remain in estrus for more than 1 month are at risk for developing estrogen-induced anemia. Hyperestrogenism from persistent estrus causes bone marrow hypoplasia of all cell lines in approximately half of ferrets in prolonged estrus (Ryland et al., 1983). Clinical signs include vulvar enlargement, bilaterally symmetric alopecia of the tail and abdomen, weakness, anorexia, depression, lethargy, weight loss, bacterial infection, and mucopurulent vaginal discharge. Hematology findings may vary from an initial neutrophilia and thrombocytosis early in the disease course to lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. The anemia begins as normocytic normochromic but progresses to macrocytic hypochromic (Sherrill and Gorham, 1985). Coagulopathy associated with hepatic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia combine to produce extensive manifestations of bleeding, pallor, melena, petechiation or ecchymosis, subdural hematoma, and hematomyelia (Hart, 1985, Fox and Bell, 1998). At necropsy, tissue pallor, light tan to pale pink bone marrow, hemorrhage, bronchopneumonia, hydrometra, pyometra, and mucopurulent vaginitis may be seen. Histopathology may reveal cystic endometrial hypoplasia, hemosiderosis, diminished splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis, and mild to moderate hepatic lipidosis (Sherrill and Gorham, 1985, Bell, 1997a). Treatment consists of terminating estrus while supporting the animal with antibiotics, blood transfusion, B vitamins, and nutritional supplementation. Estrus may be terminated by injection with 50\u2013100 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or 20 \u03bcg of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), repeated 1 week after initial injection if required. Ovariohysterectomy may be considered for ferrets that are stable and have adequate numbers of platelets and red cells. Ferrets with a packed cell volume (PCV) of 25% or greater have a good prognosis and require only termination of estrus for resolution of aplastic anemia. Jills with a PCV of 15\u201325% may require blood transfusions and have a guarded prognosis. Ferrets with a PCV of less than 15% have a poor prognosis and require aggressive therapy with multiple transfusions. The lack of identifiable blood groups in ferrets makes multiple transfusions uncomplicated by potential transfusion reactions (Manning and Bell, 1990b).",

A 40- to 45-day pseudopregnancy then follows, except in the case of ovariohysterectomy. Repeated administration of hCG may result in sensitization and anaphylaxis. After several administrations, hCG is unlikely to be effective in termination of estrus. Anaphylaxis is manifest as incoordination, tremor, vomiting, and diarrhea and may be reversed by prompt administration of diphenhydramine. In order to avoid the risk of anaphylaxis, GnRH can be injected, as it is a smaller molecule and anaphylaxis to it is extremely rare. A GnRH analog (Deslorelin)-releasing implant has recently been approved in ferrets for the treatment of hyperadrenocortisism in the United States. This implant could also be used to \u2018chemically\u2019 sterilize the female. The 4.7-mg implant has been shown to suppress clinical signs of hyperadrenocorticism for up to 30 months with an average of 17.5 months (Wagner et al., 2005).",

Anecdodal reports suggest that the clinical presentation is very much similar to the classical signs in domesticated animals, which are most consistently obesity, lethargy, decreased activity, and excessive sleeping. Ante mortem diagnosis can be challenging but a recent publication reports T4 levels using human recombinant TSH (Thyrogen) in 11 neutered ferrets, and successful stimulation of the thyroid axis was achieved by this method. Prestimulation values for T4 in neutered male and female ferrets were determined to be 29.9 \u00b1 5.8 ng/ml and 21.8 \u00b1 3.3 ng/ml, respectively. Ferrets were stimulated using 100 mg Thyrogen intramuscularly, and euthyroid ferrets were found to have an increase of 1.4-times basal levels after 4 h (Wagner, 2012). Another study involving 25 laboratory and pet neutered ferrets using the same protocol noted a median poststimulation T4 level at 34.8% above prestimulatory levels, and found the mean plasma T4 of euthyroid ferrets to be 21.3 nmol/l (Mayer et al., 2013).

            "text": "Functional pancreatic islet cell tumors (insulinomas) are the most common neoplasm diagnosed in ferrets (Li et al., 1998). Disease may be evident in ferrets as young as 2 years old, but later onset (at 4\u20135 years of age) is typical (Caplan et al., 1996, Ehrhart et al., 1996). Nonspecific presenting signs include weight loss, vomiting, and ataxia. Weakness is often evident, ranging from lethargy to posterior paresis or outright collapse (Caplan et al., 1996). Hypoglycemia caused by excess production of insulin by neoplastic \u03b2-cells may cause tremors, disorientation, or seizures (Fox and Marini, 1998). Excessive salivation (ptyalism) or pawing at the mouth is a frequent finding. Clinical signs are often intermittent or episodic. Other common findings include hindlimb weakness, splenomegaly, and lymphocytosis. Presumptive diagnosis is made based on clinical signs in conjunction with the demonstration of hypoglycemia. Blood glucose determinations for the diagnosis of insulinoma are most useful when taken after a 4-h fasting period. Fasting glucose concentrations below 60 mg/dl (3.33 mmol/l) are considered diagnostic for the condition (Quesenberry and Carpenter, 2012), whereas values between 60 and 85 mg/dl (3.33\u20134.72 mmol/l) are suspect and the test should be repeated (Fox and Marini, 1998). The repeat test should be standardized by force feeding the ferret some amount of food with subsequent fasting for 4 h prior to the repeat blood collection. Other potential causes for hypoglycemia should be ruled out, including anorexia, starvation, hepatic disease, sepsis, and nonpancreatic neoplasia (Antinoff, 1997). Demonstration of concurrent hyperinsulinemia aids the diagnosis (Caplan et al., 1996) but secretion of insulin from the pancreas can be erratic in ferrets with insulinoma, resulting in non-diagnostic baseline insulin levels. Normal insulin concentrations have been reported to be between 4.88 and 34.84 mU/ml (35\u2013250 pmol/l) (Jenkins, 2000). Medical management using prednisone and/or diazoxide along with dietary modification such as frequent feeding of high-protein meals can minimize or control clinical signs but will not affect the underlying tumor (Quesenberry and Rosenthal, 1997). Surgical exploration of the pancreas and tumor excision are recommended for animals that are healthy enough to be subjected to anesthesia and surgery. In a comparison of medical versus surgical treatment, Weiss et al., (1998) found that surgery improved disease-free interval and survival time. Histological examination of the tissue removed can provide a definitive diagnosis, and although the effect may be transient, clinical signs are often reduced or eliminated after surgical debulking (Figure 14.7, Figure 14.8\n) (Ehrhart et al., 1996). Histologically, these tumors reveal malignant proliferation of pancreatic \u03b2-cells, and local recurrence or metastasis to lymph nodes, mesentery, spleen, or liver may occur (Caplan et al., 1996) but it is considered uncommon.",

            "text": "Adrenocortical cell tumor is the second most common type of neoplasia in ferrets (Li et al., 1998) and is generally diagnosed between 3 and 6 years of age. If clinical signs are present, they often include weight loss and a bilateral, symmetric alopecia. Pruritus is a variable finding (Quesenberry and Rosenthal, 1997). These primary clinical signs in ferrets are directly related to the increase of sex steroids in the blood resulting in estrogen toxicity. Although ferrets with this syndrome have been called \u2018cushingoid,\u2019 it is rare to diagnose elevated resting levels of glucocorticoids or an abnormal response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation or dexamethasone suppression testing. The pathophysiologic difference between the ferret adrenal disease and the typical Cushing presentation is the production in affected ferrets of a significant increase of the sex steroids by the zona reticularis and not significant levels of cortisol from the zona fasciculata. The sex steroids that are usually elevated are estradiol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, and androstenedione. The elevation of the adrenal sex hormones leads to characteristic changes such as estrus-like vulvar swelling in spayed females and prostatic changes and cystitis in males (Rosenthal and Peterson, 1996, Coleman et al., 1998). Rule-outs for enlarged vulva include estrus in an intact female or functional ovarian remnants in a spayed female (Patterson et al., 2003). Abdominal palpation may reveal cranial abdominal masses, and ultrasound is extremly useful in documenting a potential increase in size of the adrenal glands. However, with an endocrine disease, the size of the organ does not always correlate with the clinical signs. It is not uncommon for a ferret to have severe clinical signs without having a truly enlarged adrenal gland (J. Mayer, personal observation). In these cases, a serum assay for abnormal levels of the sex hormones listed above should be considered (Lipman et al., 1993, Wagner and Dorn, 1994, Rosenthal and Peterson, 1996). Adrenal panels are available from the endocrinology Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine.",

Some evidence to this theory was provided in the form of the use of a GnRH vaccine (GonaCon\u2122) in the ferret. Miller et al., (2013) showed that vaccinated ferrets with similar status to deslorelin-treated animals had a significantly lower rate of adrenal disease than control ferrets over the course of 9 years.",

This localized treatment option may provide a solution to cases where complete excision or medical management is not possible. Frequently a tumor of the right adrenal will have invaded significantly into the vena cava, making partial resection or a complete removal of the vena cava the only surgical option.

Common forms are multicentric or gastrointestinal lymphoma. The early age of onset in some ferrets and reports of case clustering have led to investigation into potential infectious etiologies for lymphoma in the ferret (Erdman et al., 1996b). Earlier reports of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) seroconversion in affected animals have not been substantiated. However, experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests that a retrovirus that is distinct from FeLV may be involved (Erdman et al., 1995). In one study, whole or filtered lymphoma cells from a 3-year-old ferret with spontaneous lymphoma were injected IP into 6 recipient ferrets (Erdman et al., 1995). Two of the six ferrets were euthanized after 14 months, but the remaining four developed splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, and lymphoma. One ferret that received cell-free materials developed multicentric lymphoma with prominent cutaneous lymphoma nodules. Elevated reverse transcriptase activity and retrovirus-like particles evident by electron microscopy were seen in the donor and all of the affected recipient ferrets.",

Weight loss, anorexia, and lethargy are often reported. Splenic and/or hepatic enlargement may be evident. Cutaneous involvement has been documented (Li et al., 1995, Rosenbaum et al., 1996). Blood work should not be used as a primary diagnostic tool but it should be performed in every patient with lymphoma to evaluate overall health. Although hematological examination typically reveals anemia, which is usually mild and non-regenerative, and lymphopenia, lymphocytosis may be found, especially in younger ferrets. Lymphocytosis should not be immediately interpreted as leukemia. Ferrets with chronic inflammatory/infectious disease will often present with persistent lymphocytosis. Atypical lymphocytes are identified in the circulation in some cases. Ante mortem definitive diagnosis of lymphoma can be made by cytological examination of specimens obtained via fine-needle aspiration or excisional biopsy. Hypercalcemia can be observed in ferrets with T-cell lymphoma, but in general serum chemistry findings are usually non-pathognomonic. Ferrets with liver involvement may have elevated liver values; patients with renal lymphoma will often present with azotemia. Radiographs are useful in detecting mediastinal forms of lymphoma (Fig. 14.10a\n); ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for abdominal forms of lymphoma (Fig. 14.10b).",

Although there is a paucity of information in the veterinary literature that correlates immunophenotype with disease prognosis in ferrets, one small study found that ferrets treated with chemotherapy survived an average of 4.3 months (T-cell lymphoma) or 8.8 months (B-cell lymphoma). A proposal for a standardized classification of ferret lymphoma has been suggested in order to be able to compare cases for future evaluation and to standardize communication about cases (Table 14.8\n) (Mayer and Burgess, 2012). The staging process should include the detailed anatomical description based on the following categories: anatomical site, number of lesions, location of the lesions relative to the diaphragm, nodal versus extranodal lesions, and involvement of the blood or bone marrow.",

            "text": "Tan-colored masses involving lymph nodes, spleen, liver, or other organs are commonly found at necropsy (Fig. 14.11\n). Diffuse involvement may lead to uniform enlargement of these organs or to a thickening of the wall of the stomach or intestines. As in other species, histological evaluation reveals neoplastic lymphocytes in affected tissues, generally evident as a monomorphic population (Fig. 14.12\n) (Erdman et al., 1996a). Although surgery and radiation therapy may be useful in certain cases, most attempts to treat ferret lymphoma have utilized chemotherapeutic regimens with dosages extrapolated from other domestic animals or humans. Treatment generally results in a remission that may last from 3 months to 5 years (Brown, 1997b, Erdman et al., 1998). Different treatment protocls have been published in the past. Unfortunately, the paucity of information regarding remission durations and survival make comparison between the different protocols impossible. The simplest form of chemotherapy for lymphoma is oral prednisolone/prednisone given at 1\u20132 mg/kg PO q 12\u201324 h. This treatment will achieve partial or complete, short-lived remission. It is important that the animal should not be exposed to steriods prior to the diagnostic biopsy as the remission can occur very quickly and a false negative biopsy report would follow if the animal has been medicated for longer than 48 h. In addition, chemotherapy may be less effective in ferrets receiving chronic immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone at the start of therapy (e.g., as part of a medical insulinoma management). Most of the commonly used protocols are modified feline lymphoma protocols, which include commonly used drugs for which repeated IV access is needed. Several multidrug chemotherapy protocols have been described, using L-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and prednisone. Due to the possible complication of extravasation of these drugs and the perceived invasive charater of these protocols, one of the authors (JM) was part of a team who developed and successfully implemented a non-invasive protocol (Table 14.9, Table 14.10\n). This protocol involves only oral and SC drugs, which allow for a relatively easy implementation of the protocol without much risk or the need to hospitalize the patient. In general, chemotherapy can be considered chronic treatment because the treatment usually lasts for weeks to months.\n",

The more rapidly progressive disease encountered in young animals should likely be treated more aggressively than the indolent form commonly seen in adult animals. IV drugs should be administered with great caution through a perfectly placed catheter. Doxorubicin, and to a lesser extent, vincristine extravasation can result in severe tissue sloughing. Oral drugs can be compounded by specialty pharmacies for accurate dosing. Remember that chemotherapy administration should always be performed observing rules of maximum safety (e.g., gloves, mask, gown, goggles, dedicated area, closed administration systems, surface decontamination with bleach, etc.). To avoid the risk of extravasation and the need for repeated placement of intravenous catheters, use of a subcutaneous vascular access port (VAP) has been described (Rassnick et al., 1995). However, a surgical procedure is needed for placement of the VAP. One of the authors (JM) has also used radiation to treat lymphoma where chemotherapy was not successful or possible. Different options for radiation include targeted areas such as the lumbar spine for spinal lymphoma, half-body radiation in case of a more disseminated form (e.g., Stage 2 form), or full-body radiation for advanced forms of the disease.\n",

The prognosis is guarded for those rare chordomas that arise in the cervical region, and metastasis has been documented (Williams et al., 1993).

Physical examination may reveal signs of congestive heart failure such as hypothermia, tachycardia, cyanosis, jugular distension, and respiratory distress (Lipman et al., 1987, Heatley, 2011). Auscultation may reveal a heart murmur and/or muffled cardiac sounds. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are often identified. Radiographs may reveal an enlarged cardiac silhouette and evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Greenlee and Stephens, 1984). Electrocardiography and echocardiography can help make the definitive diagnosis (Malakoff et al., 2012, Wagner, 2009). Medical therapy (supportive care, diuretics, and inotropic drugs) may relieve clinical signs and improve the quality of life for a period of months (Stamoulis et al., 1997).

In many cases the enlarged spleen appears to be a secondary manifestation of another disease (e.g., insulinoma, cardiomyopathy, or adrenal tumor) and is of unknown significance (Stamoulis et al., 1997). Histologic examination of affected organs has revealed that the most common cause for splenic enlargement (in the absence of a neoplastic infiltrate) is extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) (Erdman et al., 1998). This may be an incidental finding, but it has been suggested that in some cases a pathologically enlarged spleen may play a role in chronic anemia that may respond to splenectomy, a syndrome known as hypersplenism (Ferguson, 1985). Splenomegaly can also be commonly found in conjunction with lymphoma, with or without intrasplenic neoplastic lymphoid accumulations. In anesthetized ferrets, splenomegaly may be caused by splenic sequestration of erythrocytes (Marini et al., 1994, Marini et al., 1997). Because this is a transient effect, the normalization of splenic size upon recovery from anesthesia can help in the differentiation of anesthetic-induced splenomegaly from that due to other causes.",

The incidence of the peripherial eosinophilia appears to be variable. Publications include numerous cases of eosinophilic gastroenteritis in which there were no changes in eosinophil concentration in peripheral blood. Presenting signs for this syndrome generally include chronic weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, and occasionally, vomiting. Eosinophilic granulomas have been found in the mesenteric lymph nodes of most affected ferrets, and in some cases other organs (e.g., lung or liver) may be involved. An interesting finding in many ferrets is the presence in inflamed lymph nodes of Splendore\u2013Hoeppli material, a histological phenomenon that has been associated in other species with helminths, bacteria, fungi, and foreign bodies (Fig. 14.13\n). An etiological agent has not been identified; consequently, therapy consists largely of supportive care to treat the chronic enteritis (Fox, 1998b). Based on the biology of eosinophils, however, the use of corticosteroids or ivermectin has been attempted and may be beneficial (Bell, 1997b).",
