A total of 69 blood samples were taken from the 43 CCs (2 serial samples from 26 patients with a 4-day interval and 1 sample from the remaining 17 patients), while 100 plasma samples were collected from 58 PCs (2 blood samples from 42 PCs and 1 single blood sample from 16 PCs). The second cohort included a total of 39 hospitalized CCs recruited from Beijing hospitals (8 severe and 31 mild to moderate cases), with 1 blood sample provided from each patient. All of the blood samples were taken between 1 and 39 days of the disease onset. In addition, a family cluster including 6 individuals over 3 generations was enrolled to validate our detection method.",

To determine the cutoff values for the ELISAs, we determined the mean values and SDs of plasma from healthy individuals. The optimal coating concentration of antigen and optimal plasma dilutions were 0.1 \u03bcg/mL and 1:200, respectively. The cutoff values were determined by calculating the mean absorbance at 450 nm (A450) of the negative sera plus 3-fold the SD values, which were 0.13, 0.1, and 0.30 for IgM, IgA, and IgG, respectively.",

The cross-reactivities were also confirmed by using ELISAs where SARS-CoV\u2013positive human plasma presented high A450 with SARS-CoV-2 rNP (Figure 1B). These results indicate cross-reactivity of antibodies to N proteins between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

The total numbers of samples positive for IgM and IgA were 188 (90.4 %) and 194 (93.3 %) of 208 plasma samples, respectively. As IgM is a marker for acute infection, we specifically examined the positivity of anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 IgM in the 41 plasma samples that were collected within 7 days PSO, which may represent acute-phase samples. Of these samples, anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 IgM was detected in 35 samples (85.4%), 27 of which were detected at a plasma dilution of 1:400 and 8 samples were detected at 1:200 dilution. IgA antibodies were detected in 38 of these early samples (92.7%), with an antibody dilution of 1:400. Based on these acute-phase samples, the IgM and IgA antibodies were both detectable at day 5 (median; interquartile range [IQR], 3\u20136 days), respectively. The anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were positive in 162 (77.9 %) plasma samples. The median time of appearance of IgG was at day 14 (IQR, 10\u201318 days) PSO (Figure 2A). The times of detection of IgM, IgA, and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 ranged from day 1 to 39 PSO in our study (data not shown).",

Further, we fitted curves of the PCR-positive rate and IgG and IgM ELISA positive rates on different days after symptom onset (Figure 4B). The detection rates between days 26 and 39 PSO are not shown due to the limited number of patients on each day. Based on the fitted curve, the PCR-positive rate was more than 90% on 1\u20133 days PSO, then declined to less than 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57.1\u201395.7%) at day 6 and less than 50% (95% CI, 23.7\u201359.5%) after 14 days PSO. Overall, the detection rate by qPCR was higher than the IgM ELISA before 5.5 days PSO, while the detection efficiency by IgM ELISA was higher than that of the PCR method after 5.5 days of symptom onset. Overall, the positive detection rate was only 51.9% in a single PCR test, but significantly increased (98.6%) when an IgM ELISA assay was applied to PCR-negative patients (Figure 4C). To further evaluate the performance of anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 IgM in COVID-19 diagnosis, we analyzed the data from the 26 CCs who had 2 serial plasma samples together with paired throat swabs within a 4-day interval. Among them, 7 patients were PCR negative when testing the first swab, but 6 patients were IgM positive. All 7 patients were PCR positive for the second swab. These results suggest that IgM ELISA can increase the positive detection rate when combined with the PCR method and can be used for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 infections.",

The PCR assay and chest CT of their close contacts, including their daughter, son-in-law, grandson, and granddaughter, were performed on 5 February. The grandmother was found to be positive on viral RNA detection by qPCR. The grandfather and daughter only presented abnormal findings on chest CT but were negative for viral RNA when tested by PCR. The grandson presented with PCR positivity with a normal chest CT. The son-in-law and granddaughter were PCR negative and showed normal lungs by CT imaging. The grandfather, daughter, son-in-low, and granddaughter were also negative for SARS-CoV-2 after the repeat PCR on the next day.

This would permit the use of serological tools to better understand the overall rate of infection in the community\u2014including the rate of asymptomatic infections. This could potentially enable us to identify healthcare workers who have been infected in the past and might be less prone to becoming infected on the job. Our data also show the ability to detect subclinical infections effectively, a much-needed tool to stop the spread of infection, which is currently spreading at an alarming rate in Europe and the United States.
