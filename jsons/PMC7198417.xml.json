In late March 2020, however daily case numbers began to plateau in Australia and by early April 2020 case numbers had dramatically reduced.[8] The significant change was a result of a combination of strict social distancing measures, restrictions on interstate travel, closed international borders, strict enforcement of isolation for infected individuals or those with high risk exposure, and an expansive testing and contact tracing program. Australia has one of the highest per capita rates of testing for COVID-19 in the world.[9] The daily number of new cases as a percentage of total case numbers (averaged over 3 days) decreased from 30% on 24 March 2020 to < 1% by 14 April 2020. Australia was averaging < 20 new cases per day for the whole country at the end of April 2020, despite broadening scope of testing in the community. Importantly, there were < 40 COVID-19 cases requiring treatment in intensive care units at the end of April 2020, indicating that the Australian health system was coping well within its reserve.[8]\n",

One of the key principles underpinning the AIS Framework is that the resumption of sport and recreation activities should not compromise the health of individuals or the community. Education of all stakeholders in the sport sector, with the aim of improving health literacy around COVID-19, is central to the AIS Framework. It will be personal behaviours, not just extensive testing that will determine whether sport can resume without compromising the health and safety of the community. The AIS Framework is intended to assist sporting organisations and individuals, from high performance/professional sport organisations to individual recreational athletes, in the complex decisions involved in moving towards normalisation of sport function. One of the many challenges faced in constructing the AIS Framework was the paucity of research, particularly in athletic populations. The AIS Framework is based on the latest data being published out of heavily affected areas in China, Europe and United States, extrapolated into the sporting context by specialists in sport and exercise medicine, infectious diseases and public health.",

Level B permits individuals to come together in small groups of up to10 people, so long as they are currently well and have been free of symptoms for 14 days. Training is permitted indoors and some limited sharing of equipment (e.g. tennis balls, footballs, basketballs, skipping ropes and gym equipment) is permitted on the understanding that the equipment is appropriately cleaned in between training sessions. Deliberate contact is not permitted but incidental bumps are tolerated. The overriding principles at Level B is \u2018get in, train and get out\u2019, where athletes and staff spend as little times as possible in changerooms, bathrooms and communal areas.",

One challenge will be that it is not possible to differentiate COVID-19 from any other 'garden variety' viral respiratory infection, based on clinical examination alone. As groups come back together for sporting purposes therefore, it is important to manage the expectations of athletes and coaches and other support staff. They will need to understand that any respiratory symptoms (even if mild) need to be reported. There will necessarily be a very low threshold for COVID-19 testing. This will inevitably involve isolation of the symptomatic individual while waiting for the test result. Athletes, coaches and other team staff need to understand that there will be more frequent disruptions to training as a result of the requirement for COVID-19 testing of symptomatic athletes/support staff. Coaches and training staff should exercise caution in avoiding training load spikes which may predispose athletes to injury.[10]\n",

An Rt of > 1 indicates that numbers of cases in the population are likely to increase. Where the Rt is equivalent to 1, active case numbers are likely to remain stable. Where the Rt is < 1, the number of active cases will diminish.[19], [20] The Rt in Australia has been < 1 since mid-April 2020. The Framework recommends that for transition to occur from one level to another, there needs to have been at least two incubation periods (i.e. four weeks) at the preceding level, with the Rt maintained < 1.",

At all times there has been an understanding that sport must proceed cautiously and must not become a source of community outbreak of COVID-19. Should such an outbreak occur, Public Health Authorities would have to intervene to contain the outbreak. There would be significant ramifications for the specific sporting organisation involved and potential consequences on the whole sport sector. Australia is currently enjoying low transmission rates, but public health and sporting authorities are aware of communities who are currently experiencing a 'second wave' of cases.
