Currently, there is no efficient treatment and prevention for this disease. We constructed recombinant adenoviral vectors that can express shRNAs, which inhibited the expression of SARS-CoV genes effectively in mammalian cells. Methods: In this study, we designed several plasmids that express small hairpin RNA molecules (shRNA) specifically targeting to the genes encoding for the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein and envelope (E) protein, respectively. Effective shRNA molecules to the viral genes were screened and identified, and then constructed into adenovirus vectors. The effects of adenovirus-delivered small hairpin RNA on SARS-CoV gene expression were determined by RT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase activity assays. Results: The levels of viral mRNAs and viral proteins of the targets were significantly decreased or completely inhibited in cell lines after being infected with the recombinant adenoviruses that expressed specific shRNA molecules. Conclusions: Since many cell types can be efficiently infected by adenovirus, recombinant adenoviruses could serve as an alternative powerful",

It was known that SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a novel human coronavirus and responsible for SARS infection [1] [2] [3] [4] . SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus, and its genome is composed of about 29,700 nucleotides [5, 6] . The SARS genome encodes 23 putative proteins that are typical of coronavirus such as 5 -replicase (rep), spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N)-3 [7] . The N protein of SARS-CoV is 422 amino acids long, sharing only 20-30% homology with the N proteins of other coronaviruses [5, 6] . Previous studies indicated that the N proteins of other coronaviruses have a variety of functional activities [8] , including participation in transcription of the viral genome, the formation of viral core, and packaging viral RNA [9, 10] . However, no similar functional roles of SARS-CoV have been reported except that SARS-CoV N may selectively activate AP-1 pathway [11] . Furthermore, SARS-CoV N protein is capable of self-association through a C-terminal 209-amino-acid interaction domain [12, 13] . The E protein is another important structural protein of SARS-CoV. More recently, it was shown to play a major role in coronavirus assembly [14, 15] .",

Specific inhibition of cellular mRNA by RNAi can be triggered in mammalian cells by the introduction of siRNA. Currently, RNAi technology is reported as an ideal tool to inhibit infectious virus replication in host cells, including poliovirus [20] , HIV-1 [21, 22] , flock house virus, Rous sarcoma virus [23] , dengue virus [24] , hepatitis C virus [25] replicons, influenza virus [26] , hepatitis B virus [27, 28] and SARS-CoV [29, 30] .",

In this report, we describe the construction of a recombinant adenoviral vector that can introduce expression of shRNAs intracellularly and inhibit the expression of SARS-CoV genes effectively.",

And because of the high sequence specificity of siRNA-mediated RNA degradation, antiviral efficacy of siRNA directed to viral genome will be largely limited by emergence of escape variants resistant to siRNA due to high mutation rates of virus, especially RNA viruses such as poliovirus, hepatitis C virus and SARS-CoV. The problem can be cir-cumvented by targeting multiple essential genes of the viruses and increasing the delivery efficiency of siRNAs. Among all the approaches the most perhaps desirable one is choosing the adenoviral vector expression system. Our results have demonstrated that inhibition of SARS-CoV genes can be achieved by adenovirus-delivered siRNAs.",

Also it provides the possibility that we apply this technique in animal model in our further investigations.",

Our results demonstrate significant inhibition of viral genes can be achieved in mammalian cells. Since many cell types can be efficiently infected by adenovirus, recombinant adenoviruses could serve as an alternative powerful tool for delivery of shRNA and for gene suppression, especially when the targeted cells are resistant to transfection by DNA or RNA. In addition, our findings also provide solid evidence for development of an anti-SARS-CoV therapy using adenovirus-delivered small hairpin RNA, which may enhance anti-SARS-CoV efficacy and overcome drug resistance. With availability of high titers of adenoviruses and uniform and rapid infection, this technology will have a foreseeable wide application both in experimental biology and molecular medicine.",
