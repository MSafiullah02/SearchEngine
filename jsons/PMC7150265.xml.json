            "text": "Viruses are small obligate intracellular parasites that may contain either an RNA or DNA genome encapsulated by a protective virus-coded protein coat. Both RNA and DNA viruses infect host organisms by entering and replicating in host cells. A virus makes multiple copies of itself in one cell, releases these copies to infect new host cells, and makes more copies. This process ultimately results in disease progression. Virus particles containing the viral genome are packaged in a protein coat called the capsid. This protein coat is surrounded by a lipid bilayer consisting of viral proteins that assist the virus in binding to the host cell membranes. The viral envelope plays a vital role in viral infection, including virus attachment to specific receptors cells. Then the penetration of enveloped viruses through fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane takes place, which may or may not involve receptor-mediated endocytosis, while nonenveloped viruses penetrate through receptor-mediated endocytosis, releasing viral content into the cells and packaging newly formed viral particles. This process involves bringing together newly formed genomic nucleic acid and structural proteins to form the nucleocapsid of the virus.",

Proteases have been identified in a wide range of viruses, without any correlation to capsid complexity, lipid envelope, or the nature of their genomes (Kr\u00e4usslich and Wimmer, 1998). They are found to be present in both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. The proteases present in various viruses specifically belong to the family of serine proteases as in hepatitis C virus (HCV), Flavivirus, and herpesviruses; the family of cysteine proteases as in adenoviruses (AdVs); or the family of aspartyl protease as in human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV1) (Marcin and Marcin, 2013). The present chapter presents introductory remarks to all kinds of viral proteases that may act simply as an appetizer to the readers, discussing in detail about the different viruses, their structures, functions, and inhibition of their proteases. This chapter first presents the biochemistry of a protease and then introduces briefly about different viruses and their proteases.",

Residues in the binding site form temporary bonds with the substrate and those in the catalytic site catalyze the reaction. The active site in the enzyme is usually a groove or pocket located in a deep tunnel within the enzyme.

An acid\u2013base\u2013nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue (usually serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine) for covalent catalysis. In three-dimensional structures of the enzyme, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino acid sequence in the primary structure. Some examples of catalytic triads are Ser-His-Asp, Cys-His-Asp, Ser-His-His, Ser-Glu-Asp, and Ser-cisSer-Lys. Enzymes that contain a catalytic triad use it for one of two reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate to a second substrate (transferases). Catalytic triads perform covalent catalysis using a residue as a nucleophile.",

The catalytic mechanism of these proteases involves either the activation of a water molecule, which acts as a nucleophile to hydrolyze the peptide bond (Fig. 1.3\n, one-step catalysis), or the use of a nucleophilic residue in a catalytic triad to perform\na nucleophilic attack that covalently links the protease to the substrate protein, releasing the first half of the product. This covalent acyl enzyme intermediate is then hydrolyzed by activated water to complete the catalysis through the release of the second half of the product and regeneration of the free enzyme (Fig. 1.3, two-step catalysis). Proteases that adopt the first mechanism are aspartic, glutamic, and metalloproteases and those that adopt second mechanism are serine, threonine, and cysteine proteases.",

They are less virulent and are often released by budding and rarely cause cell lysis. They are highly sensitive to heat and light, while infectivity gets lost upon drying. Generally, they cannot survive inside the gastrointestinal tract. Their transmission is through blood, secretions, or organ transplantation. On the other hand, nonenveloped viruses have only a capsid protein coat and are more virulent. They have more lytic actions as compared to enveloped viruses, survive longer in host cells, and are more resistant to harsh environmental conditions, and thus survive in the gastrointestinal tract for a long time. Their mode of transmission is via fomites, dust, or intake of contaminated fecal or oral matter. They induce antibodies and can retain their infectivity even after drying.

It contains positive-sense ssRNA genome approximately 14 kb in length (Simmons and Strauss, 1972, Strauss et al., 1984). Its subgenomic 26S RNA encodes the structural proteins, while nonstructural proteins are translated from genomic RNA (Cancedda and Shatkin, 1979, Simmons and Strauss, 1972, Strauss et al., 1984). The two polyproteins are cleaved posttranslationally by viral cysteine and host proteases. The structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6K, and E1) and their cleavage intermediates are involved in budding and viral encapsidation, while RNA replication takes place by nonstructural proteins (nsP1\u20134) and their cleaved intermediates also (Hardy and Strauss, 1989, Melan\u00e7on and Garoff, 1987, Strauss et al., 1984). After entry, the Alphavirus particles undergo disassembly and release genomic RNA into the cytoplasm of infected cells. From the viral genome, translation of nonstructural (P1234) and structural polyproteins takes place from open reading frames (Glanville et al., 1976). There is a cis-cleavage between nsP3 and nsP4 to yield P123 and nsP4, which forms an unstable replication complex (RC) and synthesizes negative-strand RNA. The nsP1 and P23 are trans-cleaved products of polyprotein, so nsP1, P23, and nsP4 form an RC within virus-induced cytopathic vacuoles that are active in negative-strand synthesis, as well as genomic RNA synthesis, but not in subgenomic RNA synthesis (D\u00e9 et al., 1996, Froshauer et al., 1988, Kujala et al., 2001, LaStarza et al., 1994, Salonen et al., 2003). The negative-strand synthesis is inactivated after complete cleavage to nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4, and the synthesis of positive-strand genomic RNA is switched on by the stable RC. The Alphavirus nsP2 protein is a multifunctional enzyme with the N-terminus, having RNA helicase, nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase), and RNA-dependent 5\u2032 triphosphatase (RTPase) activities (de Cedr\u00f3n et al., 1999, Karpe et al., 2011, Pastorino et al., 2008), while its C-terminus contains the protease domain (Merits et al., 2001, Strauss et al., 1992). The nsP2 is considered to be an essential protein for viral replication and propagation due to its proteolytic activities (Leung et al., 2011). The antiviral gene expression is also inhibited after its translocation into the nucleus. The proteolytic activity of nsP2 has been characterized in alphaviruses to be similar to that of papain-like cysteine protease, with a cysteine\u2013histidine catalytic dyad in the active site.",

To function as an active enzyme, the NS3 protease requires the NS2B cofactor (Falgout et al., 1991, Jan et al., 1995, Yusof et al., 2000, Zhang et al., 1992). NS2B is an integral membrane protein of 14 kDa that contains three domains: two transmembrane segments located at the N- and C-termini and a central region of 47 amino acids (spanning amino acids 49\u201396) that acts as an essential protein cofactor of the NS3 protease (Clum et al., 1997). The Flavivirus NS3 protein is neither soluble nor catalytically active as a protease in vitro, suggesting that it does not fold properly without the NS2B protein, that must be either provided in cis- (Xu et al., 2005) or in trans-form (Kim et al., 2013, Phong et al., 2011, Wu et al., 2003).",

The overall structure can be broken up into three subdomains. Subdomains 1 and 2 adopt the RecA-like fold (Rao and Rossmann, 1973, Story and Steitz, 1992) and contain eight conserved motifs essential for RNA binding, ATP hydrolysis, and communication between both binding sites (Fairman-Williams et al., 2010, Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993, Pyle, 2008). The third subdomain forms the ssRNA binding tunnel. There is also an evidence suggesting that subdomain 3 mediates the interaction between NS3 and NS5, and hence disrupting this interaction could constitute a strategy for the design of antiviral compounds (Brooks et al., 2002, Fang et al., 2013, Tay et al., 2015). NS3 also has RTPase activity, which shares the same active site for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Wang et al., 2009). RNA 5\u2032 triphosphate hydrolysis is the first step for viral RNA capping (Decroly et al., 2012). Viruses carrying a defective or impaired NS3 helicase gene cannot replicate properly, indicating an essential role for NS3 helicase/RTPase activity in virus replication (Matusan et al., 2001).",

NS3-4A has been considered as one of the most attractive targets for developing novel anti-HCV therapies. NS3 is also known as p70, a 70-kDa cleavage product of HCV polyprotein. A cleavage has to occur between NS2 and NS3 for the catalytic activity of NS3, and this is done by NS2-3 protease, an enzyme responsible for catalytic cleavage. Structural studies have confirmed that NS3 protease is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease with a catalytic triad of Ser139-His57-Asp81 (Bazan and Fletterick, 1989, Chambers et al., 1990a, Chambers et al., 1990b, Gorbalenya et al., 1989, Miller and Purcell, 1990). Its crystal structure has been well characterized (De Francesco and Steinkuhler, 2000, Morikawa et al., 2011, Raney et al., 2010). The protease contains two \u03b2-barrels and a 30-residue extension at the N-terminus. The C-terminus, which is two-third of NS3, has helicase activity and is located in the active site of NS3 protease domain. The zinc ion also plays a vital role in the stabilization of the enzyme structure and is coordinated by three cysteine residues (Cys97, Cys99, and Cys145) and a histidine residue (His149).",

            "text": "Herpesvirus protease is required for the life cycle of virus, as it carries out the maturational processing of the viral assembly protein. It was first identified in 1991 from studies on HSV1 and HCMV. The assembly protein is required to form a scaffold required for the formation of herpesvirus capsid. A temperature-sensitive mutant of HSV1 is not able to package the viral genome and produces empty capsids at the nonpermissive temperature (Gao et al., 1994, Preston et al., 1983), confirming the functional requirement of protease in completion of viral life cycle and spread of virus. The protease and assembly proteins are encoded by overlapping genes. The gene for the assembly protein uses the 3\u2032 portion of the gene for the protease. The maturational processing of the assembly protein occurs at M-site adjacent to C-terminus of assembly protein. Additionally, the protease catalyzes cleavage at R-site, which releases an N-terminal fragment of about 250 residues from the full-length protease gene product. The N-fragment retains all catalytic activity of the protease protein, and is generally referred to as the herpesvirus protease. In HCMV protease, two additional cleavages are catalyzed by an enzyme within the protease itself at the residues 143 and 209. The cleavage at residue 143 produces a two-chain form of the protease that is still catalytically active (Holwerda et al., 1994, O\u2019Boyle et al., 1995). In solution, herpesvirus protease exists in monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium, where the dimer is the only active form. The crystal structures of all herpesvirus proteases have a novel polypeptide backbone of serine proteases. It contains a central, mostly antiparallel, seven-stranded \u03b2-barrel, which is surrounded by eight helices. The active site of the protease contains a novel Ser132-His63-His157 catalytic triad. The first two residues, Ser132 and His63, are determined from biochemical and mutagenesis studies, while the third one, His157, is not fully understood, but its removal can lead to a loss of catalytic activity by >20,000-fold.\n",

            "text": "HIV1 protease plays a major in viral maturation, which is important for the production of infectious virus particles. It is an aspartic protease and the catalytic site has the characteristic Asp-Thr-Gly (Asp25, Asp26, and Asp27) sequence common to all aspartic proteases. It is a symmetric homodimer consisting of 99 amino acids per monomer (Fig. 1.5\n). The protease contains a \u03b2-sheet with the two aspartic acids Asp25 from the two monomers, forming the central active site. The active site cavity, the flexible flaps, and the dimer interface are three important regions of the protease structure. Protease inhibitors are competitive inhibitors that bind at the active site of the protease with the flaps folded into a closed conformation over the active site. The flaps were seen in closed and open conformations in the crystal structures of inhibitor-bound, as well as free protease (Liu et al., 2006, Perryman et al., 2004, Rose et al., 1998, Scott and Schiffer, 2000, Spinelli et al., 1991). This process of opening and closing of the flaps enables the substrate to enter and leave the active site of protease. Inhibitor bound at the active site with the flaps in closed conformations keeps the enzyme in a locked-down state and prevents the processing of substrates. The protease active site cavity comprises the residues Arg8, Leu23, Asp25, Gly27, Ala28, Asp29, Asp30, Val32, Lys45, Ile47, Met46, Gly48, Gly49, Ile50, Phe53, Leu76, Thr80, Pro81, Val82, and Ile84. The residues forming the substrate-binding site are mainly hydrophobic in nature; the exceptions are the catalytic residues Asp25 and Asp29, which form hydrogen bonds with the peptide main chain groups, and Arg8, Asp30, and Lys45, which can interact with polar side chains or distal main chain groups in longer peptides (Tie et al., 2005).",

Most of the processing is carried out by 3C, while 2A and leader proteases are present in only some of the picornaviruses. The 2A protease catalyzes the release of structural polyprotein at the N-terminus, while the leader protease releases itself from the polyprotein located at C-terminus (Strelbel and Beck, 1986). The 2A and leader proteases also inhibit host cell protein synthesis by cleaving host cell eukaryotic initiation factors 4G (eIF4G) during translation from 5\u2032 capped mRNA of the host cells, whereas translation from viral mRNA is not affected (Racaniello, 2001). It has been found recently that cleaved eIF4G can still support translation from capped mRNA, but not as efficiently as from viral RNA (Ali et al., 2001). Additionally, other enzymes can also cleave eIF4G, including 3C protease of FMDV (Belsham et al., 2000), HIV protease (Ventoso et al., 2001), cellular caspases, and other proteases (Zamora et al., 2002).",

The process of protein catabolism by hydrolysis of peptide bond is catalyzed by the enzyme called protease. It may also be known as peptidase or proteinase. Different classes of protease can perform the same reaction by completely different catalytic mechanisms. The catalytic mechanism of these proteases involves either the activation of a water molecule, which performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond to hydrolyze it or uses a nucleophilic residue in a catalytic triad to perform a nucleophilic attack that covalently links the protease to the substrate protein, releasing the first half of the product. Regarding the specificity of proteases, it is said that proteolysis is highly promiscuous, such that a wide range of protein substrates are hydrolyzed. Proteases, being proteins themselves, are cleaved by other protease molecules, sometimes of the same variety. Some proteases, such as TEV protease, have high specificity and cleave only a very restricted set of substrate sequences. Virus proteases are now extensively studied so that they can be exploited for drug development.",
