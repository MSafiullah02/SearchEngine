It caused a pandemic, and lead to a challenge for healthcare systems. The number of confirmed cases worldwide increased to 3.3 million and the German public health institute (Robert Koch institute) reported 161,703 cases and 6,575 deaths on May 2, 2020 in Germany. In response to the disease spreading, German hospitals started to create capacities by canceling elective admissions. The University Hospital of Essen was designated as hospital of admission for COVID-19 patients for an area of around 5 million residents.",

Since one subject was diagnosed for SARS-CoV-2 infection via PCR after a vacation in March 2020 and the comparison between groups was focused on unknown infection of healthcare workers, the subject (intermediate-risk group) was excluded from further analyzes. Subjects characteristics are listed in Table 1\n. SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies were detected in 5 of 316 (1.6%) subjects. Out of these, 3 of 244 (1.2%) subjects belonging to the high-risk group and in 2 of 37 (5.4%) belonging to the intermediate-risk group. The seroprevalence was higher in the intermediate-risk vs. high-risk group with an odds ratio of 0.22 (confidence interval 95% 0.04-1.35; p = 0.13). No participant of the control group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. The mean S/CO-value was 2.7 +/- 1.4 and did not differ significantly between groups (Table 1). Four of the five subjects (80%) with detectable antibodies reported COVID-19 associated symptoms in the past 3 months including headache (40%) and sneezing (40%). General malaise, anosmia and fever were observed in just one case each. None of the subjects suffered from cough, sore throat or dyspnea. One of the five subjects (20%) had no symptoms at all. None of the subjects were hospitalized. The transmission route could not be elucidated in all cases: Three subjects had suspected infection after unprotected professional COVID-19 exposure and in two cases the route of infection is unknown. PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab was performed in 4 out of the 5 cases without SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.",

In 5 of 316 (1.6%) healthcare workers antibodies could be detected. The seroprevalence was lower in the high-risk group vs. intermediate-risk group (3/244 (1.2%) vs. 2/37 (5.4%), with an odds ratio of 0.22 (confidence interval 95% 0.04-1.35; p = 0.13). No participant of the low-risk group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. These findings reveal the overall seroprevalence is low, which corresponds to another study from the Santa Clara County, United States with approximately 3500 subjects and a seroprevalence of 1.5% [9]. Other studies observe higher infection rates in healthcare workers. In a study of 957 employees in another German tertiary hospital 52 (5.4%) employees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. The authors underline the vulnerability of healthcare workers in the ongoing pandemic. Similar findings were observed in a Dutch study of 1353 healthcare workers of whom 86 (6%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasal swab [10]. Interestingly the authors suppose the infection to be community acquired during the early phase of pandemic. An even higher rate of infection of healthcare workers was observed in a study from the United Kingdom by Keeley et al., where 1533 symptomatic healthcare workers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection via PCR of whom 282 (18%) were tested positive [11]. They conclude that early identification of symptomatic staff members is crucial to avoid virus transmission due to staff members and to maximize the available workforce. However, comparison to the current study is restricted since the other studies used nasal swab and PCR to determine the rate of infection, although the nasal swab has a volatile positive rate which depends on the practical application and the onset of infection [12] and the PCR has to be improved [13].",

The low seroprevalence in the high-risk group might be an indicator that the local hygiene standard is effective (Fig. 1). However, the higher seroprevalence in the intermediate-group suggests that the awareness of COVID-19 patient-to staff transmission must be maintained, even in non-COVID-19 wards. Yet the current study did not evaluate the adherence to local guidelines. To estimate the efficiency of the hygiene standard determination of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence might be performed. Furthermore it can provide an overview of the current seroprevalence of the population in the context of missing vaccination and in the context development of herd immunity [14]. Healthcare workers with immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may be less vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However antibody detection is no assurance of protective immunity [15].",
