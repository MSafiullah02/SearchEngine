EBLV-1 seems to be restricted to the infection of serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus) [3], although it has been reported in \u2018spill-over\u2019 events into incidental hosts [18, 22, 24]. In comparison to EBLV-1, EBLV-2 has been reported on fewer occasions, having been isolated from both Daubenton\u2019s bats (Myotis daubentonii) and pond bats (Myotis dasycneme) [20]. The discovery of EBLV-2 in a Daubenton\u2019s bat in June 1996 in Newhaven, East Sussex, prompted concerns that bat rabies may be present within the UK and, furthermore, that the threat of rabies entering the UK via migratory bats was realistic [28]. Indeed, bat rabies cases in European bats in the mid 1980s indicated a possible spread of the virus, especially in Denmark and the Netherlands. As well as having been isolated in the UK, EBLV-2 isolates have also been reported in Switzerland, Holland and Finland [16, 25]. EBLV-2 infection has also been observed in Daubenton\u2019s bats in Germany [6, 19].",

The bat carcass was submitted to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) for laboratory testing to confirm the presence of EBLV-2 and was shown to be positive by the fluorescent antibody test (FAT). Confirmatory diagnosis was achieved by PCR using a hemi-nested RT-PCR that detected viral RNA in brain, salivary gland and tongue samples (Fig. 1a). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was undertaken using previously described methods [27] to determine levels of viral RNA present within different organs of the infected animal (Fig. 1b). High levels of viral RNA were detected in the brain, with lower levels in the salivary glands, stomach and tongue, with RNA also being detected in the intestine and heart (Fig. 1c). Immunohistochemical analyses were restricted to sections of the spinal cord and detected virus antigen in dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 2a).\n\n\n",

Importantly, control measures were implemented, including the wearing of protective gloves so that staff could handle a bat with minimal risk during the regular checks before members of the public entered the tower of the castle [2]. Signs were also erected at the entrance of the tower warning members of the public not to handle bats.",

The bat was a juvenile male Daubenton\u2019s bat and was submitted to the VLA for routine testing. This bat was also shown to be positive for infection with EBLV-2 by RT-PCR, a 405-base-pair (bp) fragment of the nucleocapsid (N) gene being successfully amplified. Unfortunately, the standard FAT could not be undertaken, as the brain material had decomposed during storage and transit. The remainder of the carcass of this bat was, however, submitted for histopathological examination. Several sections were taken, and despite advanced autolysis, specific labelling was found throughout the spinal cord in neurons, dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 2b) and peripheral nerves. The N-gene PCR product was sequenced in its entirety and found to be 100% identical to the 2007 isolate across the 405-bp region analysed. A phylogenetic analysis of the EBLV-2 isolates across the UK to date was generated using the neighbour-joining method, using Mega 4 software (Fig. 1d). Unfortunately, the carcass of this bat was severely decomposed, and further molecular tests, such as comparative qRT-PCR on a range of organs, could not be performed.",

Presence of virus in these regions is likely to be linked to the degree of innervation, principally by the autonomic nervous system, although quantitation of neuronal involvement within different organs and tissue types to establish a basis for this hypothesis has not been undertaken [4, 12].

In 2008, advanced autolysis prevented thorough histological examination or molecular assessment of the tongue. Granular immunolabelling was, however, seen in nerves at the base of the tongue and along the jaw. Unfortunately, no taste buds or epithelial tissue was available for further testing.",

            "text": "The mechanisms of maintenance of EBLVs within bat roosts and transmission between individuals remains unknown, although the \u2018small vector hypothesis\u2019 remains plausible [17]. The restriction of EBLV infection to certain species of bat as well as mechanisms by which individuals are able to survive infection, or at least exposure to the virus, are key questions that remain [26]. Viral load, bite/exposure site and immunological competence of the exposed animal may all affect the outcome of infection. Factors such as seasonal variation, pregnancy, nutritional status and immune status must also play an important part in dictating whether or not bats succumb to infection [21], but currently, our understanding of bat biology and immunology is low. The detection of a large number of viruses within different bat species has highlighted this lack of knowledge [1]. Isolation of a number of zoonotic viruses in bat species, including coronaviruses, astroviruses, henipaviruses and other lyssaviruses, will surely drive further scientific investigation [9, 15, 23, 29]. Clearly, with EBLV-2 having now been identified on two separate occasions from the same roost, virus is being maintained and transmitted from bat-to-bat by some as yet undefined mechanism. The status of Daubenton\u2019s bats, and indeed all bats across the UK, as protected species makes it difficult to undertake investigative studies at such sites. However, serosurveillance of bats are planned at the Stokesay Castle site that will allow determination of the level of seroconversion within this roost and highlight possible transmission mechanisms that will help understand the transmission biology of these elusive viruses and may identify those parameters needed to enhance strategies to combat neuroinvasion and subsequent disease development.",
