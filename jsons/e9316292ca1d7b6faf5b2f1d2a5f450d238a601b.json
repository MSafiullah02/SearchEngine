Two measures were used to analyze the importance of a protein in the human PPIN. The first is the node degree, which is defined as the number of connections the node has to other nodes in the human PPIN; the other is the node betweenness, which is defined as the number of shortest paths that pass through the node. The degree and betweenness for each protein in the PPIN were calculated with functions of degree() and betweenness() in the package \"igraph\" (version 1.0.0) (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) in R (version 3.2.5).

Analysis showed that in the database of mammalian protein sequences, there were 108 richly-annotated mammal species which had far more protein sequences than other mammal species did (Table S4) . Therefore, only these 108 mammal species were considered in the evolutionary analysis. Based on the results of BLAST, the homolog for the viral receptor was defined as the hit with E-value small than 1E-10, coverage equal to or greater than 80% and sequence identity equal to or greater than 30%. Only the closest homolog, i.e., the best hit, in each mammal species was used for further analysis.",
