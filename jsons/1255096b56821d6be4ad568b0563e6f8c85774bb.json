The high binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 correlates with its 13 efficient spread among humans. On the other hand, ACE2 negatively regulates the 14 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) primarily by converting angiotensin II 15 to angiotensin 1-7, which exerts a beneficial effect on coronavirus-induced acute lung 16 injury. Human recombinant ACE2 has been considered as a potential therapy for 17 SARS-CoV-2 by blocking virus entry and redressing the imbalance of RAAS in 18 SARS-CoV-2 infection. The level of ACE2 expression can be upregulated by 19 treatment with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker \u2161 20 (ARB). To date, no evidence shows that ACEIs or ARBs increase the susceptibility 21 and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and hence, it is not advisable to 22 discontinue such drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important metalloproteinase, plays 51 a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1 ACE2 not only mediates viral infection but also 52 exerts important regulatory effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 53 (RAAS) and participates in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) after infection. 54",

The results showed that treatment with rhACE2 significantly alleviated lung 253 injury induced by acid aspiration. This phenomenon was present in both Ace2 254 knockout and wild-type mice. However, injection of rhACE2 without catalytic 255 activity could not alleviate acid aspiration-induced ALI. These results suggest that 256 ACE2 with catalytic activity has a protective role in ALI. 257",

However, treatment with rhACE2 alleviated lung injury and 260 simultaneously decreased Ang II expression, and treatment with an AT1R antagonist 261 or ACE inactivation alleviated ALI in Ace2 knockout mice. 49 These results suggested 262 that ACE2 negatively regulated ACE/Ang I /AT1R to alleviate ALI. Although there is few direct evidence of SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI, we 296 speculate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have a similar pathogenesis owing to 297 their high homology. An in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 298 will help in the development of targeted interventions to control the COVID-19 299 epidemic. ACE2 is not only a receptor that mediates coronavirus infection, but is also 300 an important RAAS enzyme that regulates virus infection-induced ALI. Although 301 increased ACE2 expression may elevate the risk of coronavirus infection, it may also 302 have protective effects against ALI. However, the effects of enhanced ACE2 303 expression (such as RAAS inhibition) on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and patient 304 outcomes are not fully understood, and further basic and clinical studies are urgently 305 required. 306",

Structural 110 analysis shows that the spike protein of SARS-CoV comes in contact with the apex of subunit I in the catalytic domain of ACE2 without involvement of subunit II and does 112 not block the active site. Once the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV 113 spike protein binds to ACE2, the extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved and the 114 transmembrane domain migrates into the cell, mediating further fusion between virus 115 particles and host cells 20 (Figure 2). 116 117 ACE2 also participates in amino acid absorption in the intestine. In the intestine, 118 ACE2 binds to the B 0 AT1 amino acid transporter 21 to mediate neutral amino acid 119 absorption. This amino acid transport function is not associated with the protease 120 activity of ACE2. 121 122 Regulation of ACE2 expression 123 Regulation of ACE2 expression by pathophysiological status 124 ACE2 mRNA and protein levels were shown to be downregulated in the kidneys 125 of mouse models of hypertension and diabetes. 8,22 Zisman et al 23 observed that the 126 ACE2 protein level was significantly increased in failing human hearts with 127 idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Brake et al. showed elevated ACE2 protein levels 128 in the lung tissues of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 129 smokers with normal lung function. 24 Kuba et al 25 demonstrated that ACE2 protein 130 expression was significantly decreased in a mouse model of ALI. Koitka et al 26 131 discovered that ACE2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in rats 132 with kidney disease or rats that underwent subtotal nephrectomy. However, the 133 precise molecular mechanism of ACE2 regulation remains unclear. Some 134 transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms have been investigated. ACE2 135 was recognized as a target gene for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b2 (HNF-1\u03b2), as binding 136 sites for HNF-1\u03b2 were identified in the promoter regions of ACE2. 27 Accumulation of 137 hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1, a crucial transcription factor, was found to decrease 138 ACE2 mRNA and protein levels at the later stages of hypoxia. 28 Energy stress has 139 been shown to regulate ACE2 mRNA expression by activating adenosine 140 monophosphate kinase, following which sirtuin 1 binds to the promoter region of 141 ACE2 and enhances its transcription. 17 Furthermore, microRNA-421 was shown to 142 bind with the 3\u02b9-untranslated region of ACE2 transcript and reduce ACE2 protein 143 level post-transcriptionally. 29 144 Regulation of ACE2 expression by drugs 145 RAAS inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and AT1R antagonists, can 146 upregulate ACE2 mRNA levels. Ishiyama et al 30 employed a rat model of myocardial 147infarction to assess the effects of myocardial infarction on myocardial ACE2 mRNA 148 expression. The results showed that myocardial infarction did not cause significant 149 changes in the myocardial ACE2 mRNA level; however, when the rats were treated 150",

Interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-4 could 161 reduce ACE2 mRNA levels and ACE2 expression in epithelial cells in vitro to 162 decrease susceptibility to SARS-CoV. 33 Additionally, Tikoo et al 34 showed that ACE2 163 protein but not mRNA expression was downregulated in the rabbit heart and kidneys 164 in a high-cholesterol diet-induced atherosclerosis model. However, atorvastatin 165 treatment increased ACE2 protein expression in the heart and kidneys, but only 166 increased ACE2 mRNA level in the heart. Furthermore, enhanced occupancy of histone H3 acetylation mark on the promoter region of ACE2 was observed in the 168 heart after atorvastatin treatment, suggesting that epigenetic regulation might be 169 involved. 170 171 Other regulatory mechanisms of ACE2-shedding and internalization 172 In 2003, ACE2 was confirmed to be a receptor for SARS-CoV. After the spike 173 protein of SARS-CoV comes in contact with ACE2, the complete molecular structure 174 or transmembrane domain of ACE2 and the virus are endocytosed (internalized) using 175 clathrin. Under the effects of trypsin and furin, the spike proteins are further activated 176 to induce membrane fusion, and the virus RNA is released into the cytoplasm, thereby 177 infecting the cell 19 . In addition, cleavage of the extracellular domain of ACE2 178 (shedding) can occur under the action of the transmembrane protein, a disintegrin and 179 metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), to release the catalytic domain to the extracellular 180 space 35 . Although the physiological function of shedding has not been fully elucidated, 181 studies have shown that it is associated with virus entry into cells and virus replication 182 36 .

As the imbalance between 269 ACE and ACE2 plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI, interventions 270 targeting ACE2 may improve the prognosis of patients with severe COVID-19. In 271 various animal models of ALI, administration of rhACE2 has been shown to improve 272 distribution of pulmonary blood flow, lung function, and elastance, and attenuate 273 edema formation, hypoxemia, and pulmonary hypertension. 49,52 Moreover, rhACE2 274 was found to be capable of binding to the coronavirus directly. Li et al 19 showed that a 275 soluble form of ACE2 could bind the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV spike protein in 276 Vero E6 cells with a high affinity. Hofmann et al 53 proved that the soluble ACE2 277 ectodomain dose-dependently blocked SARS-CoV spike-induced pseudovirus 278 infection of 293T cells. Recent in vitro experiments by Monteil et al. showed that rhACE2 dose-dependently decreased SARS-CoV-2 growth in Vero E6 cells by a 280 factor of 1,000-5,000, and effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of human 281 blood vessel and kidney organoids in vitro, which suggested that rhACE2 could block 282 the early entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. 54 In addition, previous studies have 283 validated the safety of rhACE2 in healthy volunteers and patients with ARDS without 284 any adverse effects on hemodynamic parameters. 55-57 Currently, the application of 285 rhACE2 in patients with severe COVID-19 is in the trial phase (Clinicaltrials.gov 286 #NCT04287686). Activators of ACE2, such as diminazene aceturate have been 287 shown to increase the enzymatic activity of ACE2 and might exert protective effects 288 on SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI. 58 Besides, ACEIs and AT1R antagonists can be used 289 to inhibit the effect of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis to alleviate lung injury. According 290 to two recent observational studies, there is no evidence as yet that ACEIs or AT1R 291 antagonists enhance the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 59,60 Similarly, Ang 1-7 292peptide may be used for its protective effects on lung tissues through Mas.",

Currently, this 34 virus is believed to originate from bats and is transmitted to humans through an 35 intermediate host before human-to-human transmission, which results in the spread of 36 the disease.1 The gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shares 79% and 50% similarity with 37 that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East 38 respiratory syndrome coronavirus, respectively, and it is highly infectious. 2 Infection 39 with SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by fever, fatigue, and cough, but some patients40 also develop myalgia, dyspnea, and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, 41 nausea, and vomiting. Severe dyspnea and hypoxemia occurs within one week of 42 onset in severely affected patients, which rapidly progresses to acute respiratory 43 distress syndrome (ARDS) (in 41.8% of patients), shock, multi-organ failure, or even 44 death (in 21.9% of patients). 3 Lung autopsies of patients who had severe COVID-19 45 showed alveolar epithelial cell detachment, pulmonary interstitial lymphocyte 46 infiltration, and hyaline membrane formation, which suggested the development of 47 ARDS. Multinucleated syncytial cells and atypical enlarged pneumocytes could be 48 observed in the alveoli, which are indicators of virus-infected cells; however, virus 49 inclusion bodies were not detected. 4 50",
