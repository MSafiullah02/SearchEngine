There would be the need to apply an inclusion and exclusion/prioritization criteria. Basic public health principles of reaching the unreached have to be applied. Even in a refugee camp or an evacuation center, there would be marginalized groups or sites.3.Early on in the emergency phase, the basic public health services should be restored. There would be a need to reestablish damaged or destroyed utilities, early provision of water and sanitation, and provision of soap, water containers, and health education.4.Effective emergency/disaster healthcare must be based on accurate information and public health principles. Decisions as to intervention activities must be based on accurate data and health information. There have been various public health rapid assessment tools that have been designed and practice guidelines are readily available.5.Public health and emergency management has evolved into a specialized field, although one may not be able to claim that it is as sophisticated as clinical specialties or other subdisciplines in public health. There is a greater appreciation now that approaches are more evidence-based.\n",
