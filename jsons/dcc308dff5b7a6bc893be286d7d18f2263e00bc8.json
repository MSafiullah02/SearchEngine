Extensive sequencing efforts (3, 4) , combined with ad hoc bioinformatics developments (5) , have now led to the identification of 1222 distinct miRNAs in human and of many miRNAs in other multicellular organisms (accessible through miRBase, version 16, the main miRNA online registry) (6) . It is currently postulated that the total number of human miRNAs should not exceed 2000. Mature miRNAs, approximately 22 nucleotides long (7, 8) , are usually derived from a primary transcript called pri-miRNA, usually transcribed by a type II RNA polymerase (transcription by type III RNA polymerase has also been suggested for some miRNAs (9, 10) ; but see also (11) (12) (13) (14) ). Pri-miRNAs are cleaved into the nucleus by Microprocessor, a hetero-dimer composed of Drosha, an RNase III endonuclease, and DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8)/Pasha. This first cleavage liberates the pre-miRNA (formed by a hairpin of about 70 nucleotides that includes an overhang of 2-3 nucleotides at the 3 end). Pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm via exportin-5 in a Ran GTP-dependent manner. In the cytoplasm, cleavage of each pre-miRNA near the hairpin by Dicer, a second RNase III endonuclease, generates two short RNA sequences: one sequence corresponds to the mature miRNA, while the second is usually degraded (15) (16) (17) . The final effector able to interact with the target mRNAs is the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The efficient transfer of nascent miR-NAs from Dicer to this complex necessitates that Dicer assembles with the RNA-binding protein TRBP and members of the Argonaute family to form a RISC-loading complex, before loading of the miRNA on Argonautes (18) . Each resulting RISC complex can directly interact with its target mRNA(s) (19) . The cytoplasmic steps of miRNA biosynthesis largely overlap with those of siRNA biosynthesis. More specifically, human AGO1 and AGO2, but not AGO3 and AGO4, possess strand-dissociating activity of miRNA duplexes. They function as RNA chaperones, capable of performing multiple rounds of strand dissociation, while only AGO2 has target RNA cleavage activity (also called slicer activity) (20) .",

Recent experimental evidences demonstrate convincingly that interactions take place within the 3 -non-coding region in 40% of the cases (especially at proximity of the stop codon and near the poly A tail, 23a) within the CDS in 25% of the cases, and within the 5 -non-coding region in 1% of the cases, the rest of the hybridizations being located within non-coding RNAs and intronic, intergenic, or other sequences (24) .",

Estimation is that up to 30% of human genes could potentially be regulated by miRNAs (25) . This view, implying that miRNAs can \"tune\" the expression of most of their putative targets, needs probably to be reappraised, since miRNAs and their predicted targets are not necessarily co-expressed into the same cell, nor within the same subcellular compartment. The ability of the miRNA to interact with many targets, together with the possibility for several miRNAs to share a same target, represents a powerful mechanism to increase tremendously the complexity of biological networks. Challenges in miRNA research are currently to improve the prediction of miRNA targets and to integrate their complex modes of regulation into already existing biological networks. miRNA regulates protein synthesis at a post-transcriptional level, by affecting mRNA translation or stability. More specifically, miRNA base pairing to a target mRNA can induce posttranscriptional gene repression by deadenylation (26) (27) (28) , inhibition of translation (29, 30) , or mRNA cleavage (31) . In some cases, miRNA can also relocalize target mRNA to cytoplasm foci called P-bodies for storage or degradation (32) . A careful comparison between gene expression and proteomic measurements after overexpression of a specific miRNA has shown that most of the proteins which were deregulated at a protein level were also affected at an mRNA level (33) . This observation implies that analysis at a transcript level can often be sufficient to identify relevant miRNA::mRNA complexes.",

During lung development, a maternally imprinted miRNA cluster located at human chromosome 14q32.21 (mouse chromosome 12F2) is upregulated in neonatal mouse as well as in fetal human lung. This locus includes the miR-154 and miR-335 families and is situated within the imprinted Gtl2-Dio3 domain. Several miRNAs are upregulated in adult compared to neonatal/fetal lung, including miR-29a and miR-29b. Williams et al. observed no significant changes in the expression of 256 miRNAs, over lung ageing up to 18 months of age in female BALB/c mice (35) . The most dramatic variations occurred at the onset of ciliogenesis, with the increased expression of 12 microRNAs (miR-449a, miR-449b, miR-449b * , miR-449c, miR-34a, miR-34b-3p, miR-34b-5p, miR-34c-5p, miR-92b, miR-191, miR-1975, miR-125a), and the decreased expression of 11 microRNAs (miR-17, miR-193b, miR-31, miR-31 * , miR-130a, miR-205, miR-21, miR-24-1, miR-24-2, miR-210, miR-29a).",

It has been linked to cancer (47) (48) (49) (50) , viral infection (51) , and immunity (52) (53) (54) (55) . MiR-155 has been shown to be induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as LPS, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), IL-1, and TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages and dendritic cells (56) (57) (58) , in particular through NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factors (56, 59, 60) . It has also been detected in fibroblasts from different origins (61) including lung (62) in which miR-155 was also found to be upregulated by IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (63) as well as overexpressed in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (63) . Multiple targets for miR-155 have been identified in several cell types and linked with the regulation of B-and T-cell differentiation (53, 54, (64) (65) (66) , TLR signaling in inflammatory cells (58) , or cellular adhesion in epithelial malignancies (67) . Interestingly, BIC-deficient mice displayed significant remodeling of lung airways with age, associated with increased bronchiolar subepithelial collagen deposition and increased cell mass of sub-bronchiolar myofibroblasts. Recently, Pottier et al. (63) have found that miR-155 targets keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, FGF-7), a paracrine-acting, epithelial mitogen and a central mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. Overall miR-155 would be involved in the attenuation of the inflammatory signaling pathway (58) and epithelial regeneration (63), making it a potential key player during lung injuries. Bhattacharyya et al. (67a) have shown that miR-155 was also more than 5-fold elevated in CF IB3-1 lung epithelial cells in culture, compared to control IB3-1/S9 cells. They also detected it in CF lung epithelial cells, and in circulating CF neutrophils. They propose that elevated miR-155 could contribute to proinflammatory expression of IL-8 in CF lung epithelial cells by lowering SHIP1 expression and activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",

Respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus, induce acute infections of the respiratory tract that lead to clinical pictures going from rhinitis, otitis, bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Respiratory epithelial cells represent the primary targets that initially detect the viruses. Their resistance to infection depends on their capacity to detect and restrict virus replication. From that perspective, degradation of the viral genome appears as an ad hoc mechanism for efficient antiviral defense. The contribution of small non-coding RNA to this mechanism has been well-established in plants and invertebrates (68) , but rarely in mammals, where the innate antiviral response is rather mediated by a robust type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03bb)-mediated response (69, 70) . In that case, virus recognition occurs through the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, usually viral nucleic acids) by pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) (71) . Interactions within the cytoplasm or at the host cell surface lead to robust cytokine and chemokine responses, via several distinct pathways of activation (72, 73) . Interestingly, Otsuka et al. have reported that a mouse mutant with hypomorphic Dicer1 expression (Dicer1(d/d)) was more prone to infection by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (74) . These authors detected that host miR-24 and miR-93 were increasing VSV replication in Dicer1-deficient cells after interfering with viral transcripts, without altering VSV genome-derived siRNA pathways and interferon-mediated antiviral responses. miR-122, on the contrary, was required for hepatitis C proliferation in liver (75) .",

They found a large number of differentially expressed miRNAs between infected and noninfected tissues (73 in lungs and 36 in tracheae) (76) . Alteration of the expression of several miRNAs in bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) at the onset of infection by SARS-CoV, which causes acute infectious disease associated with pulmonary fibrosis and lung failure, has been described by Mallick et al., who suggest that BASCs correspond to the primary site of infection (77) .

Indeed, some miRNAs can be defined as bona fide tumor suppressors or oncogenes. miRNA expression appears in various tumors as a more robust method for classifying cancer subtypes than mRNA expression profiles (85) . Numerous publications have documented aberrant expression of miRNAs in cancers (83, (86) (87) (88) (89) . Specific reviews about miRNAs and lung cancer can be found elsewhere (90) (91) (92) .

Micro-TopTable ranks the transcripts into three categories (\"upregulated,\" \"downregulated,\" and \"non-modulated\"), according to thresholds for expression level and for differential expression. MicroTopTable then calculates the number of predicted targets for each miRNA, according to the prediction software selected, in each of the three categories. Enrichment in miRNA targets in each category is then tested using a hypergeometric law. More systematic analyses can be performed with Sylamer, which measures hypergeometric P-values for all short sequences of fixed length across a ranked gene list (130).",

Interestingly, Chi et al. have decoded microRNA::mRNA interaction maps by a technique called \"Argonaute HITS-CLIP.\" These authors used high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by immunoprecipitation of covalent crosslink between the Argonaute protein and RNA complexes (i.e., miRNA::mRNA). This produced two simultaneous data sets -Ago-miRNA and Ago-mRNA binding sites -that were electronically combined to identify interaction sites between miRNA and target mRNA. \"Argonaute HITS-CLIP\" provides a general platform for exploring the specificity and range of miRNA action in vivo and identifies precise sequences interacting into pertinent miRNA::mRNA interactions. A systematic use of such a technology may help unravel the precise interactions existing in vivo between miRNAs and mRNAs. Azuma-Mukai et al. have used a simpler approach that identifies miRNAs associated with hAgo2 and hAgo3 (138) . Proteomic approaches, based on differential labeling of the biological samples, have shown that a single miRNA can repress the production of hundreds of proteins. Surprisingly, this repression appears usually relatively mild (see above) (33, 139) . Interestingly, changes in translation efficiencies of targeted mRNAs were highly correlated with changes in the abundance of those RNAs, suggesting a functional link between microRNA-mediated repression of translation and mRNA decay (134).",

With 15, 908, 20, 158, 22, 974, 23, 438 , and 24,408 proteincoding genes reported by Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org) in chicken, Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, human, and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively, while genome sizes vary from 0.1 \u00d7 10 9 nucleotides to 3.4 \u00d7 10 9 nucleotides, it is clear that a large fraction of the genome indeed exerts its biological functions independently of its translation into protein(s) (141, 142) . Though the focus of this review was limited to microRNAs (miRNA), which constitute a tiny subclass of regulatory non-coding RNAs, many more works will be necessary to unravel the many roles played by non-coding RNAs in biological processes. It remains that miR-NAs deserve a special interest due to their already established association with many biological processes and to the already ongoing efforts to transfer them into new useful prognosis markers, therapeutic targets, or targeted drugs.
