This resulted in the shutdown of all economic activity and accordingly the production at manufacturing plants across most sectors was halted. While there is an urgency to resume production, there is an even greater need to ensure the safety of the workforce at the plant site. Reports indicate that maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks while at work clearly reduces the risk of transmission. We decided to use computer vision on CCTV feeds to monitor worker activity and detect violations which trigger real time voice alerts on the shop floor. This paper describes an efficient and economic approach of using AI to create a safe environment in a manufacturing setup. We demonstrate our approach to build a robust social distancing measurement algorithm using a mix of modern-day deep learning and classic projective geometry techniques. We have deployed our solution at manufacturing plants across the Aditya Birla Group (ABG). We have also described our face mask detection approach which provides a high accuracy across a range of customized masks.",

Accordingly, processes are being put in place to educate the workforce regarding new safety regulations at the workplace which helps reduce the risk of virus transmission.

Once detected, a real time voice alert is triggered in the area of the violation. This feedback helps reduce the violations and thus contributes to the overall safety at the plant. In addition, these alerts are stored in a central repository that helps the management analyze the trends and take suitable actions to curb the violations.

We finally convert the trained model to Intermediate Representation (IR) format for OpenVINO Deep Learning Workbench [22] . As the MobileNetV2 paper confirms that it utilizes standard operations present in all neural frameworks, it was easy for us to convert native TensorFlow from binary format to the OpenVINO (IR) format. We trained the model using TensorFlow Object Detection API. We used 300 \u00d7 300 size input for our SSD model with MobileNetV2 as backbone. We trained the model for 500,000 steps with rmsprop optimizer. The parameters were configured to = 0.004 with decay factor = 0.95. After training, the final results achieved were @. 50 = 0.897 and @0.75 = 0.505.",

The output from the model is a list of coordinates of bounding rectangles on detected persons; where a single rectangle is represented as: [xmin, ymin, width, height]. To find out if the detected people are following social distancing, we need to calculate the Euclidean distance between the bounding rectangles. The imaging plane or the camera plane is a 2D projection of 3D world coordinates therefore, the spatial relationship between the objects in this plane changes due to camera perspective. The objects near to the camera appear larger than those that are away from it. Calculating the distance between the rectangles in this perspective would give an incorrect estimate of the actual distance, we must correct it by transforming the image into top-down-view or bird's-eye-view. This is done by applying an Inverse Perspective Transform onto the image. In essence, we compute the Homography Matrix (denoted here as M) which is used to carry out the transformation. There are three parts to the calculation of M, and are detailed below [26] ",
