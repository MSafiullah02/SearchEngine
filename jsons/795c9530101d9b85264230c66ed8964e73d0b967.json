Samples were also examined for Salmonella spp., and identification of viruses and parasite ova. Neither Salmonella spp. nor Aeromonas spp. were isolated from the feces of 34 control horses. Aeromonas spp. were isolated from feces of 22 of 40 (55%) horses with diarrhea. Salmonella spp. were isolated from feces of 8 (20%) horses, and of these, 5 (12.5%) were also positive for Aeromonas spp. Twenty-nine isolates of Aeromonas spp. were recovered from the feces of 22 diarrheic horses. Of these isolates, more than 80% were susceptible on in vitro testing to amikacin, ceftiofur, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin. All isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin. Diarrheic horses positive for Aeromonas were significantly (P \u03ed .04) older than diarrheic horses negative for Aeromonas spp. A significantly greater number of fecal samples were positive for Aeromonas spp. during March through August than samples examined in other months (P \u03ed .014). Results of this study indicate that Aeromonas spp. should be considered as a cause of diarrhea in horses.",

            "text": "I nvestigations into the etiology of diarrhea in horses are often restricted to confirmation or exclusion of salmonellosis. 1 Other bacteria recognized or suspected to cause diarrhea in horses or foals include Clostridium spp., [2] [3] [4] Campylobacter spp., 5, 6 Escherichia coli, [7] [8] [9] Streptococcus durans, 8, 10 Bacteroides fragilis, 11 Actinobacillus equuli, 5 Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, [12] [13] [14] Aeromonas hydrophila, 5, 8, 15 Rhodococcus equi, 16 and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 17 Whether or not these bacteria are an important cause of diarrhea in the horse is unknown because of difficulties in isolation or because some may be part of the intestinal flora of normal horses. The prevalence of Aeromonas spp. in the gastrointestinal tract of horses, particularly in association with disease, is unknown. Aeromonas spp. may be a cause of diarrhea in foals, based on isolation of A. hydrophila from feces of two 3-day-old diarrheic foals. 8 Isolation of A. hydrophila from enteric lesions of horses lead to speculation that this organism was a potential enteric equine pathogen. 5 During a 2-year prospective study of diarrheic foals in Britain and Ireland, A. hydrophila was isolated from the feces of 9% (28/ 304) of the diarrheic foals. 15 A. hydrophila was associated with diarrhea and septic arthritis in a 4-day-old foal. 18 Aeromonas spp. are gram-negative rods commonly found in water and soil. The genus Aeromonas is composed of at least 12 recognized species, each representing distinct DNA homology groups. In addition, there are several species of questionable validity and a number of unnamed DNA hybridization groups. 19, 20 Members of this genus have long been recognized as pathogens of fish and reptiles. 21 Aeromonas spp. cause gastrointestinal and soft tissue infections in immunocompetent humans and disseminated infections in immunocompromised humans. 22, 23 Aeromonas spp. are recovered from feces of humans with diarrhea more commonly than from feces of asymptomatic humans. 24, 25 Aeromonas probably causes diarrhea in humans by adherence to mucosa and elaboration of toxins. 26, 27 Known risk factors for disease in humans include swimming in or drinking untreated water and antimicrobial therapy with agents that are ineffective against aeromonads. 24 From May 1993 through September 1995, 56% of 110 fecal samples from horses with diarrhea examined for enteric bacterial pathogens in our laboratory were positive for Aeromonas spp. Consequently, an investigation was undertaken to determine the prevalence of aeromonads in feces from healthy and diarrheic horses and the possible association between isolation of Aeromonas spp. and diarrhea in horses. Feces from horses with diarrhea were also examined for the presence of Salmonella spp., viruses, and parasite ova.",

The high isolation rate of Aeromonas spp. possibly could be attributed to the intestinal environment of horses with diarrhea that may support proliferation of this organism. The Aeromonas isolation rate (55%) in this study is much higher than the 9% reported from diarrheic foals in Great Britain and Ireland. 15 The difference in isolation rate between these 2 groups of diarrheic horses may be related to the differences in age of horses sampled, environment, or specimen handling.",

Aeromonads are isolated most commonly from the feces of both symptomatic and asymptomatic humans during the warmest months of the year. 37, 38 Because this study was conducted over 12 months, feces of control and diarrheic horses were examined during both warm and cold months. In the earlier survey, 39 feces were collected during May through November, which coincides with the highest occurrence of Aeromonas spp. in drinking water. 35, 36, 38 A correlation exists between isolation of A. hydrophila from animal feces and its presence in their drinking water. The prevalence of Aeromonas spp. in apparently healthy animals may reflect constant exposure to Aeromonas-contaminated water. 40 Furthermore, prevalence of Aeromonas spp. in feces of symptomatic and asymptomatic humans shows geographical variation.
