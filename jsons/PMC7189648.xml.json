The disease is now a pandemic with, as at 22 April 2020, more than 2.4 million confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from multiple continents, leading to more than 162,000 deaths [2]. While there are estimates of disease severity and infection attack rates, the true severity of disease remains a major knowledge gap because mild or asymptomatic infections are difficult to estimate [3]. The invisible \u2018iceberg\u2019 of mild infections needs to be estimated to fully assess disease severity, as was done during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic using population-based sero-epidemiology [4]. These studies allowed us to accurately estimate the true age-specific hospitalisation rates, intensive care admission rates and deaths [5]. Such information is crucial in order to assess development of herd immunity and to calibrate our response to this pandemic.",

            "text": "In order to carry out age-stratified population-based sero-epidemiology, it is important to validate serological methods that can be used in such large-scale studies. Ideally, we need highly sensitive high-throughput assays for rapid screening large numbers of sera and highly specific assays that can be used to confirm those sera identified to be positive in the screening tests. These assays also need to be evaluated in different specimen types (e.g. serum, plasma) to maximise the available options for study design. We developed an ELISA assay based on the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for use as a screening assay and micro-neutralisation (MN) and plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT) using live virus in biosafety level 3 containment as confirmatory tests. We evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of each of these tests in a cohort of patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 disease and in an age-stratified set of control sera collected before the emergence of COVID-19 to serve as a negative control population.",

Baculovirus was generated by transfecting purified bacmid DNA into Sf9 cells using FuGENE HD (Promega, Madison, US), and subsequently used to infect suspension cultures of High Five cells (Life Technologies) at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 5 to 10. Infected High Five cells were incubated at 28 \u00b0C with shaking at 110 rpm for 72 h for protein expression. The supernatant was then concentrated using a Centramate cassette (10 kDa molecular weight cut-off for RBD, Pall Corporation, New York, USA).

An additional plate was coated overnight with PBS buffer only and used as control to subtract non-specific serum binding to the plate, i.e. serum-specific background noise (SSBN) normalisation approach [9]. The plates coated with either purified recombinant protein or PBS were then blocked with 100 \u03bcl of Chonblock blocking/sample dilution ELISA buffer (Chondrex Inc, Redmon, US) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Each serum or plasma sample was tested at a dilution of 1:100 in Chonblock blocking/sample dilution ELISA buffer and added to the ELISA wells of each plate for 2 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C. After extensive washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:5,000, GE Healthcare) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgM (1:5,000, GE Healthcare) was added for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The ELISA plates were then washed five times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Subsequently, 100 \u03bcL of HRP substrate (Ncm TMB One; New Cell and Molecular Biotech Co. Ltd, Suzhou, China) was added into each well. After 15 min incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcL of 2 M H2SO4 solution and analysed on a Sunrise (Tecan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland) absorbance microplate reader at 450 nm wavelength.

Our strategy was to use an IgG ELISA targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a screening assay, confirming any positive results by PRNT90 assays. Even though the RBD ELISA assay was specific in our evaluation reported here, a confirmatory test with neutralisation would be good practice for the studies envisaged. Even more importantly, not all RBD ELISA-positive samples may have neutralising activity. While a positive RBD ELISA result, even if specific, provides evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, it is no assurance of protective immunity, whereas the presence of neutralising antibodies would provide greater assurance of protection. However, more research is needed on the correlates of protection in all these serological assays. Our results on the comparative sensitivity of the MN and PRNT90 test suggest that PRNT90 is the confirmatory assay of choice, at least until a fully validated pseudotype neutralisation assay is available. The RBD ELISA can be completed in a day while the PRNT90 neutralisation confirmation takes 4 days more and two tests require ca 100 \u03bcl of serum. ",

In order to optimise the sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG ELISA as a screening assay, we set the cut-off for a positive result as 3 SD above the mean of negative control sera. None of the control sera had IgM or IgG ELISA OD values above the cut-off. Similarly, none of the negative control sera gave any reactivity in the MN or PRNT90 assays. Convalescent sera from patients with RT-PCR-confirmed 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 infections were negative in MN assays to SARS-CoV-2, further confirming the specificity of the MN assay, but there was insufficient serum available to test these sera in PRNT90 or ELISA assays. The SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG, MN and PRNT90 assays showed no detectable cross-reactivity even to the closely related SARS-CoV in convalescent sera from SARS patients. We therefore conclude that the ELISA IgG, MN and PRNT90 antibody assays are specific for SARS-CoV-2. Extensive experience with MN and PRNT90 assays for MERS-CoV [11] provides further reassurance that these neutralisation assays are specific, discriminate between different human coronaviruses and can be used for confirmation of sera positive in the screening ELISA.",

While serum is the conventional specimen used in such studies, plasma may be available from residual blood submitted for other laboratory tests such as those sent for clinical biochemistry or haematology investigations. We therefore evaluated in the ELISA IgG and MN assay a small number of heparin plasma samples available from these patients, collected in parallel with the serum samples. There was good correlation in the IgG ELISA results between serum and plasma. However, it was notable that the MN titre in plasma was 4\u201316-fold higher that than detected in the concurrent serum. We showed that this was due to the heparin or another component in the heparin blood collection tube that contributed to reducing the effective TCID50 of the virus challenge dose in MN assays. Thus, caution is needed in the interpretation of neutralisation results from heparin plasma. None of the negative control plasma samples tested gave any detectable neutralisation of the virus at a screening dilution of 1:10. Nevertheless, if neutralisation is going to be used for confirmation, it would be important that heparinised plasma is avoided because of unpredictable effects on the effective virus inoculum.

We have previously shown that large-scale sero-epidemiological studies can provide population infection attack rates in near real time [16].",
