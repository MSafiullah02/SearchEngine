However, the impact of acute, pervasive, and continuing stressors on societal and individual psychologies, such as those associated with highly infectious and fatal disease outbreaks (Leppin and Aro, 2009 ) is poorly understood. Further, little is known about the prevalence and risk factors for mental health problems when faced with such stressors. Studies based on the similar 2003 SARS epidemic outbreak indicated that during the epidemic, different groups of people from the general public to health care workers had varying degrees of psychological problems such as fear and worry (Loh et al., 2005; Mihashi et al., 2009) , PTSD and depression (Chen et al., 2006) .

However, the objective factor of 'living in the worst-hit area' had a relatively minor contribution. Fear is an adaptive response that initiates defensive behaviors to protect the self from danger, which means that PTSD can occur when fear is inappropriately regulated (Rau et al., 2005) . A central PTSD problem has been found to be a reduced capacity to suppress fear even in safe conditions (Norrholm et al., 2011) . However, in this Page 13 study, fear was found to be an important predictor for both PTSD and depression. This was in contrast with previous studies that found that impaired fear inhibition was a biomarker for PTSD but not for depression (Jovanovic et al., 2010) . One possible explanation for these results is that in some vulnerable personality types, anger and fear traits may act as moderators or mediators between fear and psychological distress (Lara and Akiskal, 2006) . Given the contagious nature of the COVID 2019 and its long incubation period (14 days or more), many people may have feared that they would be unwittingly infected and would spread the disease to their family members.",
