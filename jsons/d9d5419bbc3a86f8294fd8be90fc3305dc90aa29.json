In this study, we aimed to explore the elements that may reduce the negative effects on mental health of the quarantine period imposed by most governments during this worldwide crisis. We conducted an online survey to evaluate demographic, lifestyle and mental health variables in the Portuguese population. We observed that factors related with living conditions, maintaining the work either online or in the workplace, frequency of exercise and absence of a previous psychological or physic disorders are protective features of psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, stress and obsessivecompulsive symptoms). Finally, the individuals previously receiving psychotherapeutic support exhibited better psychological indicators if they did not interrupt the process as a consequence of the outbreak. Our results indicate that the practice of physical exercise, reduced consumption of COVID-19 information and the implementation of remote mental healthcare measures might prevent larger impacts on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

            "text": "The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has originated a worldwide crisis with dramatic consequences for health, economy and society (Holmes et al., 2020) . Most governments are imposing quarantine periods, where the movements and contact between people are restricted to reduce the propagation of the disease. While the use of quarantine plays a critical role for the promotion of public health safety, it also has marked negative effects. In such an unprecedent scenario for most of us, people are restricted of maintaining contact with loved ones, their daily routines are dramatically changed, and their working activities needs profound adjustments (Brooks et al., 2020) . These factors together with the uncertainty, distress and fear related to the progression of the disease are likely to increase the psychological burden, including anxiety , acute stress or depression (Brooks et al., 2020; Holmes et al., 2020) . Furthermore, whereas the absent of a quarantine can be even more detrimental to the psychological health (Hawryluck et al., 2004) , the results from previous investigations highlight that the psychological impact of a quarantine is substantial and may subsist in the long-term (Brooks et al., 2020; Holmes et al., 2020) . As such, considering that the quarantine period is a necessary measure in most countries to face the COVID-19 pandemic, it is of utmost relevance to understand how we can minimize its negative psychological effects. In line with this, we conducted a crosssectional investigation to understand whether specific variables related with living conditions during the quarantine period may have a protective role on mental health-being of the Portuguese population. In Portugal, the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed on 2 March 2020 and the Portuguese government imposed the emergency state (quarantine and social distancing measures) on 19 March 2020. Portugal has currently 23,392 confirmed and 231,737 suspected cases of COVID-19, with 1,277 recoveries and 880 deaths (25 April 2020; www.dgs.pt).",

Severe depression, anxiety and stress symptoms correspond to subscale scores higher than 10, 7 and 12, respectively. The Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory -Revised scale (OCI) (Foa et al., 2002) was also included to measure obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in the previous month. An OCI-R score higher than 20 indicates the presence of OC disorder. The health status was also characterized regarding the existence of a previous diagnosis of physical (PhysicalDisorder) or psychological (PhychDisorder) conditions, and whether the participants were receiving mental health support (MentalSupport). Questions pertaining to living conditions were also included: the existence of outdoor green spaces (Garden), number of individuals sharing the property (Housemates), and the presence of pets (Pets). Participants also indicated their current work status: whether they were working at the regular workplace (WorkRegular), teleworking (WorkOnline), or not working (NoWork). A set of questions was also included to characterize the frequency of daily activities, namely the number of hours doing exercise (Exercise) and consuming information related to COVID-19 (MediaTime).",

They proposed that their routine was severely impacted by COVID-19 in comparison to older adults. Our results also point to a higher risk for younger individuals, despite the lack of children and adolescents in our sample. Other authors have also demonstrated that depression and anxiety levels were higher in individuals under 35 years of age (Huang and Zhao, 2020) . Anxiety has been demonstrated to increase with increased concerns about the impact of the virus on economic and academic domains and decreased social support in college students (Cao et al., 2020) , further supporting our findings. However, past research in China reported decreased distress in individuals under 18 years of age, but also enhanced distress for adults with age between 18 and 30 years in line with our findings (Qiu et al., 2020) .",

Augmented washing and avoidance behaviors in face of putative contamination was associated with decreased PTS and DASS-21 scores .

Our results of severe OC symptoms in 12.4% of the sample might indicate an increase in OC symptoms during the pandemic, but this need to be confirmed by longitudinal analyses.

Each separate plot represents the estimates of a single linear regression model (the dependent variable Y is specified on the plot title). The vertical line corresponds to the boundary of statistical significance (i.e., no effect). Each row represents one predictor X: the dot is the regression coefficient, i.e., the estimated change in the outcome variable Y for each unit increase in the predictor X (blue and red correspond to positive and negative effects); the 95% confidence interval for the coefficient is represented as the segment line -if the interval does not cross the vertical line, X has a statistically significant effect on the dependent variable Y (considering a p-level of .05). The top of the figure includes the regression models for the full sample (n=1280); the predictors that were statistically significant in at least one model were included in the regression models for the subsample (n=204; individuals receiving psychotherapeutic/psychiatric treatment before the pandemic).
