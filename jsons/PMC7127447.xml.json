A susceptible person is an uninfected person who can be infected through contact with an infectious or exposed person, an exposed person is someone who has come into contact with an infectious person but is asymptomatic, an infectious person is symptomatic, and a recovered person is someone who has recovered from the disease. It is assumed that a recovered individual cannot become infected again. In an SEQIJR model, two extra categories of quarantined (Q) and isolated (J) are added to the SEIR model. A quarantined person is an exposed person who is removed from contact with the general population and an isolated person is an infectious person who is removed from contact with the general population, usually by being admitted to a hospital. Quarantine and isolation are important in controlling epidemics because they are effective methods of reducing the contact between infected and susceptible populations.",

Firstly, Gumel et al. suggested parameter values which can be used to obtain physically reasonable models for the four SARS outbreaks in Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto. Secondly, considerable data are available on the SARS outbreaks and mathematical models and the effectiveness of control measures have been studied by many authors (see, e.g., [[3], [7], [11], [13], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [26], [30]]).",

They analyzed the effects of quarantine and isolation on the transmission of SARS and showed that an effective isolation policy was more important than quarantine or a combination of quarantine and a less effective isolation policy in reducing the transmission of the disease. A similar conclusion was obtained by Koonprasert et al. [9] in a numerical study of the effectiveness of quarantine and isolation. However, as noted by a number of authors (see, e.g., [[4], [5], [14], [15], [24], [28]]), the effectiveness of isolation requires strict hospital hygiene to reduce the hospital-based (nosocomial) spread of a disease.",

Therefore, a negative trace and a positive determinant for the Jacobian of a system of 6 equations are necessary but not sufficient conditions for the real parts of all eigenvalues to be negative and for an equilibrium point to be locally stable.

Since the dynamical behavior for the four infected populations are similar, we will only show the solutions for the infectious population (I) and for the susceptible (S) and recovered (R) populations. The solutions for the S, I and R populations are shown in Fig. 3 first for a short integration time to show the initial behavior and then for a long integration time to show the convergence to an endemic equilibrium. It can be seen that the convergence to the endemic equilibrium is very slow and that many disease outbreaks occur during this period. This type of behavior was very common in \u201cchildhood\u201d diseases such as measles, mumps, poliomyelitis, rubella, whooping cough etc. before vaccines became available for these diseases. Although it is difficult to see in Fig. 3, we found that epidemics can recur when the fraction of the susceptible population exceeds a certain critical level due to births or if the population of the immune recovered population falls below a certain critical level due to deaths. Similar results for the dynamical behavior of populations in the endemic region have also been reported by Koonprasert et al.

As special cases, we have obtained simple formulas for the reproduction numbers for a 100% susceptible population (the basic reproduction number R0=\u03b1L\u03b1S) and for the disease-free equilibrium Rdf=\u03bc\u03b1L(\u03bc+\u03bd)\u03b1S by both the next-generation method [23] and from the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the linearized model about the disease-free equilibrium. In these formulas, \u03b1L can be interpreted as the rate of new infections from all infected individuals and \u03b1S as the rate of reduction of the susceptible population due to transfers to other population groups including to the recovered immune group. The effect of the immunization rate (\u03bd) in reducing the reproduction number and increasing the stability of disease-free equilibrium states can be clearly seen by comparing the R0 and Rdf formulas.

For each of the four regions we have considered parameter values corresponding to a disease-free equilibrium and an endemic equilibrium. From the computed sensitivity indices for each of the regions, we have shown that the most important parameters for reducing infection are, in order, (1) for high immunization rates (\u03bd\u22480.01) reduce the overall infection rate (\u03b2), increase the immunization rate, and reduce the modification factor for infection by isolated individuals (\u03b5J), (2) for critical immunization rates with Rdf\u22481, reduce \u03b2, reduce \u03b5J and increase recovery rate of isolated individuals (\u03c32), (3) for low immunization rates (endemic equilibrium) the most important for Beijing and Hong Kong is to increase the isolation rate of infectious individuals (\u03b32) and the most important for Canada and Singapore is to reduce \u03b2.",

Therefore, the immunization results in this paper are not relevant for the SARS outbreaks of 2002\u20132003. However, the inclusion of immunization in the study of an SEQIJR model is important as the SEQIJR model is a very general model which can be applied to a number of other diseases that are also mainly transmitted by person to person contact and for which immunization is available, e.g., influenza and \u201cchildhood diseases\u201d such as measles, mumps, whooping cough etc. A similar model with the addition of a bird reservoir of the disease could also be used to analyze avian influenza. SEIR models have, of course, been studied by many authors and there is now an extensive literature on them. However, we would note that the formulas for generalized reproduction numbers, sensitivity indices and critical immunization levels for the SEQIJR model could easily be applied to SEIR models by removing the quarantined and isolated compartments and suitably redefining some of the parameters.",
