            "text": "Viruses in the family Picornaviridae are small, icosahedral and nonenveloped, with a polyadenylated, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome and these viruses are currently divided into 29 officially recognized genera: Aphthovirus, Aquamavirus, Avihepatovirus, Avisivirus, Cardiovirus, Cosavirus, Dicipivirus, Enterovirus, Erbovirus, Gallivirus, Hepatovirus, Hunnivirus, Kobuvirus, Kunsagivirus, Megrivirus, Mischivirus, Mosavirus, Oscivirus, Parechovirus, Pasivirus, Passerivirus, Rosavirus, Sakobuvirus, Salivirus, Sapelovirus, Senecavirus, Sicinivirus, Teschovirus and Tremovirus (Knowles et al., 2012, Adams et al., 2013) plus several candidate genera. Recently, a number of novel picornaviruses were discovered from different hosts (Boros et al., 2012, Pankovics et al., 2012, Reuter et al., 2012, Sauvage et al., 2012, Boros et al., 2013, Liao et al., 2014) and the list of picornaviruses is rapidly expanding (http://www.picornaviridae.com). In the Asia-Pacific region, several new picornaviruses, including three bat picornaviruses, one feline picornavirus, and one canine picornavirus were discovered in Hong Kong (Lau et al., 2011, Lau et al., 2012, Woo et al., 2012). However, their clinical relevance remains to be elucidated. Picornaviruses can cause various symptoms including diarrhea and they are widely distributed in animals (Whitton et al., 2005). In the course of surveillance for unexplained bovine diarrhea, using a metagenomics approach, we identified some novel picornaviruses. The present study describes the identification of these new picornaviruses (termed bovine Japanese picornaviruses) from fecal samples of calves with diarrhea in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan and the genomic characterization of these viruses.",

The most common bovine viral pathogens inducing diarrhea, including group A, B, and C rotaviruses, bovine torovirus, and bovine coronavirus had been ruled out as the cause of the diarrhea by using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR diagnostic assays (20%; 10 of 50 samples). Samples were collected directly from the rectums to prevent contamination from the environment or between samples. Fecal samples were diluted 1:9 (w/v) in sterile phosphate-buffered saline with 1% antibiotics, and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 \ng for 10 min followed by filtration through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter.

Five of 18 sequence contigs, that had a length of approximately 7500 nt, were derived from five calves with diarrhea kept on five dairy farms and exhibited similarity to nucleotide sequences of other unclassified picornavirus genomes. Three of the five samples had more than two contigs (two samples: unclassified picornavirus and bovine kobuvirus, one sample; unclassified picornavirus, bovine kobuvirus and bovine astrovirus). Since the nucleotide sequence homology of the five contigs to other picornavirus genomes was rather low (<50%), we performed further analyses of these five contigs which were termed Bo-11-39, Bo-12-3, Bo-12-7, Bo-12-11, and Bo-12-38.",

We determined nearly complete genome sequences (including the complete open reading frames) of Bo-12-3, Bo-12-7, Bo-12-11 and Bo-12-38 but could not completely determine the sequence due to insufficient amount of samples. The genome organization of each is similar to that of other picornaviruses. They include a single large open reading frame (ORF) containing 6915 nt (Bo-11-38), or 7023 nt (Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38), which encodes a polyprotein precursor of 2305 amino acids (aa) (Bo-11-39), or 2341 aa (Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38), flanked by the 5'UTR and the 3'UTR with a poly(A) tail. Cleavage sites within the polyprotein were predicted by NetPicoRNA analysis and alignments with other picornaviruses. The junction sites appeared to be mainly Gln(Q)/Gly(G), except for predicted cleavage sites of the L/VP4 (Arg(R)/Gly(G), Bo-11-38 and Thr(T)/Gly(G), Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38), VP4/VP2 (Lys(K)/Ser(S)), and VP1/2A (Asp(D)/ Gly(G), Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38), respectively (Fig. 1\n). The coding region consists of a leader protein (L), a structural protein region P1 (833 aa), and the non-structural protein regions P2 (645 aa in Bo-11-39 and 654 aa in Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38), and P3 (768 aa in Bo-11-39 and 793 aa in Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38). Pair-wise alignment of the amino acid sequences of Bo-11-39 and Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38 with those of other picornaviruses revealed that they shared higher sequence identities with bovine enterovirus 1 (P1: 36.1% and 34.8%; P2: 30.0% and 29.0%; P3: 43.2% and 42.0%) and porcine sapelovirus 1 (P1: 38.9% and 39.5%; P2: 30.5% and 28.0%; P3: 45.9% and 44.0%) than with other representative viruses from the recognized genera within the Picornaviridae. However, the highest sequence identities were found with unclassified Chinese picornaviruses; bat picornavirus group 1\u20133 (P1: 45.4\u201348.4%; P2: 40.0\u201342.5%; P3: 49.6\u201355.2%), feline picornavirus (P1: 49.3\u201351.4%; P2: 41.4\u201344.9%; P3: 51.5\u201352.3 %), and canine picornavirus (P1: 48.8\u201350.3%; P2: 38.0\u201340.7%; P3: 53.3%) (Table 1\n).

In contrast, the only 20.1\u201324.2% nt identities were found with the bat picornavirus group 1 and 2, and feline picornavirus sequences, which have type IV IRES elements (Table 2\n). Within the picornavirus family it is now known that there are four classes of IRES element which vary in size and properties (Belsham, 2009). Secondary structure prediction of the 5\u2032-UTR of Bo-11-39 using the Mfold program revealed a stable stem-loop structure at the extreme 5\u2032 end of the genome, many picornaviruses have such a feature (Fig. 2\n(a)). Bat picornavirus group 3 has a section of the 5\u2032-UTR with high nucleotide identity to the corresponding region of poliovirus (Lau et al., 2011). Similarly, the 5\u2032-UTR of Bo-11-39 and Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38 also has a region (position from nt 353 to nt 527 in Bo-11-39 and nt 317 to nt 490 in Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38) with high similarity to that of human enteroviruses (76\u201381%) including poliovirus (75\u201381%). A potential structures for domain V of the Bo-11-39 IRES, which by analogy to the poliovirus IRES, should bind to eIF4G (de Breyne et al., 2009) is shown in Fig. 2(b). Both the base of the domain and the apex were extremely similar to other type I IRES elements and the domain is followed by a pyrimidine rich tract and then a short stem loop (domain VI), which contains an AUG and this is probably the site at which ribosomes start scanning although protein synthesis starts at the next AUG (at nt 554) (Fig. 2(c)). We predict that the translation initiation sites of Bo-11-39 and Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38 are at position nt 554 and nt 513, respectively, which is contained in the sequence GCCA554UGU in Bo-11-39 (Fig. 2(c)) and AACA513UGC in Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38. The initiation codon is not in an optimal Kozak context (Kozak, 1986) RNNAUGG with one nucleotide substitution (from G to U after AUG (RNNAUGU) in Bo-11-39 and G to C after AUG (RNNAUGC) in Bo-12-3, 7, 11 and 38). The 3\u2032-UTR of bovine Japanese picornavirus was not closely related to any nucleotide sequences in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database. There is less than 22.8% sequence identity within the 3\u2032UTR between them and the unclassified Chinese picornaviruses.",

We tried to isolate viruses using primary bovine testis cells, primary bovine fetal muscles cells, the Madin\u2013Darby Bovine Kidney cells, Vero cells, baby hamster kidney cells, cloned porcine kidney cells, and HRT-18 cells. Neither cytopathic effect nor the expected RT-PCR products from RNA extracted from cell culture supernatants were observed in any of the inoculated cells, indicating a lack of virus replication in these cell lines. However, using RNA-seq based strategy with DNase treatment before construction of cDNA libraries, we could obtain sufficient viral genomic sequences of RNA viruses from fecal samples not only for picornaviruses but also, in earlier studies, for other viruses such as rotavirus (Minami-Fukuda et al., 2013, Masuda et al., 2014, Nagai et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Genomic characterization showed that these bovine Japanese picornaviruses had a genome organization similar to other picornaviruses, i.e. the presence of single large open reading frame flanked by UTRs. The 5\u2032UTR of bovine Japanese picornavirus begins with a stem loop structure of about 50 nt, which is different from entero-/rhinoviruses that have a cloverleaf structure. However these viruses appear to have a type I IRES with a predicted domain IV (including a loop B), plus the domains V and VI including the eIF4G binding site and an AUG codon respectively, the latter is preceded by a polypyrimidine tract. Comparisons with representative strains of the different defined genera in the family Picornaviridae revealed that amino acid identities in the P1, P2, and P3 regions were up to 39.5, 30.5, and 45.9%, respectively. The Picornaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (http://www.picornastudygroup.com/definitions/genus_definition.htm) has proposed that different picornavirus genera are defined by amino acid identity in the P1, P2, and P3 regions being <40, <40, and <50%, respectively. Based on these criteria, bovine Japanese picornaviruses do not fall into the current official genera. On the other hand, bovine Japanese picornaviruses shared 45.4 to 51.4% (P1), 38.0 to 44.9% (P2), and 49.6 to 55.2% (P3) amino acid identities with certain unclassified Chinese picornaviruses; bat picornaviruses group 1-3 (Lau et al., 2011), feline picornavirus (Lau et al., 2012), and canine picornavirus (Woo et al., 2012), respectively. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that bovine Japanese picornaviruses formed a cluster with unclassified Chinese picornaviruses in P1, 2C, 3CD, and VP1 coding regions, respectively, suggesting that bovine Japanese picornaviruses may be classified together with the currently unclassified Chinese picornaviruses into a novel genus in the family Picornaviridae.",

Genomic comparison of bovine Japanese picornaviruses with unclassified Chinese picornaviruses revealed that although amino acid identities in L, 2A, 2B, and 3A were low (<40%), amino acid identities in the other regions were higher and indicated that these viruses were moderately related to each other. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 coding regions indicated that bovine Japanese picornaviruses and unclassified Chinese picornaviruses formed a cluster with high bootstrap support, even though VP1 is the most diverse capsid protein of picornaviruses (Oberste et al., 1999, Rossmann et al., 1985). These findings suggest that they have a common ancestor. Bovine Japanese picornaviruses seem most related to bat picornavirus group 3 and canine picornaviruses which also contain a type I IRES. RNA viruses have a remarkable potential to evolve due to high mutation and recombination rates (Cook et al., 2013). Bovine Japanese picornaviruses may be derived from the unclassified Chinese picornavirus and have evolved independently in cattle in Japan.",

These finding indicates that these viruses are circulating in Hokkaido Prefecture in Japan. The potential transmission of these viruses to other domestic animals or human should be clarified. Since we did not perform analyses using fecal samples of cattle without diarrhea, the association of bovine Japanese picornaviruses with bovine diarrhea is unclear. To clarify whether they are associated or causal for bovine diarrhea, further studies are needed.",
