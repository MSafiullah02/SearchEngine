In a study of patients undergoing major surgery in New York,1 5.2% were HCV positive, 1.4% HBV positive, and 1.6% HIV positive (or 6.7% with one or more of these viruses). Often, the presence of infection is unknown or is not reported to the pathology department. Healthcare workers are at risk for contracting these diseases when working with patients (Box 8-1\n). The risk is lower for pathology personnel, but exposure can occur by aerosolization of tissues, needlestick injury, scalpel wounds, and mucocutaneous exposure during the processing of pathology specimens.Box 8-1Diseases that have been transmitted to healthcare workers\n\u2022Hepatitis B, C, and A\u2022Tuberculosis (including strains resistant to multiple drugs)\u2022HIV\u2022Syphilis\u2022Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease\u2022\nCoccidioides immitis (the risk arises primarily from cultures of the fungus in microbiology laboratories); if this infection is suspected, all specimens must be labeled appropriately\u2022Parvovirus and H. pylori infection, cryptosporidiosis, scabies, pertussis\n",
