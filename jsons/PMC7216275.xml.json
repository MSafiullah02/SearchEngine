Keeping people calm and focused is necessary during an epidemic and its quarantine period. If people are quarantined, the roles of E-Govt and word of mouth (WOM), especially message sharing through social media, increase in importance. Now, with the current COVID-19 outbreak, people are under quarantine until further notice, with many countries experiencing epidemic outbreaks. People have more time to use social media, which could be a source of rumors, anxiety, and, most important, knowledge for health protection. This phenomenon encouraged us to formulate a theoretical model based on social presence theory and the role of social media to help examine safety and participation in quarantine. The conceptual model is presented in Figure 1.",

Positive awareness through the effects of COVID-19 word of mouth (2019-nCoV-WOM) and E-Govt in the epidemic period has not been sufficiently explored. Regardless of the important roles of 2019-nCoV-WOM and E-Govt in the epidemic outbreak, quantity of research is lacking. Although online social presence is important at this time, scholars have not explored it sufficiently. From the literature, questions were raised whether online social presence increased the ability to obtain information about the safety measures and, with 24 h of free time to use social media, if people might be more willing to spread safety information. On this basis, we tried to explore the direct effect of 2019-nCoV-WOM and E-Govt on online social presence, and tried to fill this gap using a cohesive methodology to identify the mediating effect of attitude toward epidemic outbreak and epidemic protection on online social presence. We used five constructs (2019-nCoV-WOM, role of E-Govt, attitude toward epidemic outbreak, epidemic protection, and online social presence in the outbreak) with a conceptual multi-mediation model. We explored a distinctive approach to answer two questions: Is there any mediating effect of attitude toward epidemic outbreak and epidemic protection on online social presence? What is the best possible combination for the government to increase people\u2019s willingness to participate in quarantine with a psychological perspective?",

If not familiar with the data type or if the data have a common factor or are composite-based, findings illustrate that use partial least squares (PLS) is the best choice for analysis [73]. Appraisal and review studies explained that in management research with multivariable analysis techniques, the application of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has been increased [74]. PLS-SEM is being increasingly used in investigative and theory-based research [75]. Use of PLS is increasing in different branches of management, especially research with one-variable-based techniques [76]. Past studies showed that PLS-SEM in different branches of management research have used multivariate analysis. As research in online user psychology is in its infancy and is not as developed as management research, the existing psychological studies about patients during pandemics during a sensitive time period (isolation)does not adequately explain the behavioral psychology of online users. As such, we applied PLS-SEM (smart PLS) in our research [74].",

These were supported because we did not add up zero values in any confidence interval [78]. At present, in standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) PLS path modeling, mostly model fit criteria are used. We checked the accuracy of the fit by using different tools like value of normed fit index (NFI), the non-normed fit index (NNFI), the comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and SRMR. Values equal to or higher than 0.95 in NFI, NNFI, and CFI indicate the best fit. Sufficient adjustment was represented by RMSEA and SRMR with values less than 0.06 [87]. For comparatively good fit between the hypothesized model and observed data, a cut-off value near to 0.08 for SRMR and near 0.06 is best for RMSEA; Hu, L.T. et al. [88] stated that a zero value for SRMR indicates an ideal fit but if the value is smaller than 0.05,the fit is satisfactory fit [89]. We investigated the standards of the coefficient of determination (R2) to verify the predictive strength of our structure model. Collective consequences of exogenous contracts on endogenous constructs were indicated. The R2 of the endogenous latent variables is the vital decisive factor for this evaluation. This marker is used, from the perspective of a statistical model, to forecast future results or can be used to check the hypothesis on behalf of other related information. R2 also provides the results of the calculations and describes the practicality of the results [90]. Researchers can also use PLS procedure to check their model\u2019s out-of-sample predictive power [91]. In-sample predictive power, we also refer to the R2 [92]. R2 varies from 0 to 1 and greater values show better descriptive power. Substantial, moderate, and weak descriptive powers are indicated by R2 values of 0.75, 0.50, and 0.25, respectively [93]. PLS-SEM is less dependent on the model fit concept compared to CB-SEM [79].",

The blindfold method was used to check the strength of the research model. Cohen\u2019s f2 is an identical measure of effect size that also permits checking the local effect size, which is the effect of one variable compared with the multivariate regression model [94]. If the cross-validated redundancy (Q2) is higher than 0,then the model is related to predicting that factor [95]. We focused on in-sample prediction more, compared to out-sample prediction, prognostic significance Q2, and relative relevance Q2, which are alternatives for evaluating a model\u2019s practical relevance, in addition to consulting R2 outcomes as a gauge of a model\u2019s predictive capabilities [95]. R2, Q2, path coefficients, and the effect size (f2) are the decisive factors we use for evaluation. In addition to this evaluation, researchers are required to check the inner model for potential co linearity issues. If the constructs are interrelated, then results approximated by the inner model are considered biased [96]. A model\u2019s predictive accuracy is decided by the R2. The R2 value also characterizes the combined consequence of exogenous variables on the endogenous variable(s). The effect ranges from 0 to 1. A value of 1 indicates complete predictive accuracy as can see in Table 6. ",

A mediating variable may have a transitional role in the association between dependent and independent variables, and engagement of this third variable is the important feature of the mediating effect [98].

The magnitude and strength of epidemic protection (H4b: a1b1) and attitude toward epidemic outbreak (H5b: a2b2) mediated the association between the role of E-Govt and online social presence (Figure 5). We found via comparison that epidemic protection has a partial mediation effect on the role of E-Govt and online social presence because the VAF value was more than 0.2, which indicated that there is a partial mediation effect. As such, H4b is supported. Attitude toward epidemic outbreaks mediated the association between 2019-nCoV-WOM and online social presence; the VAF value was greater than 0.2, which indicated the presence of mediation. Therefore, we hypothesized imaginary harmonizing partial mediation because the effects of 2019-nCoV-WOMwere considerable both directly and indirectly and their products were positive [99].",

However, future research can be improved using different types of research variables, using web scraping and web mining of top trends complete protection analyses. However, our findings can be implemented to improve online social presence and increase emotive protection during epidemic quarantine periods. Fourth, the data were collected online. Therefore, we were unable to gauge the respondents\u2019 responses during data collection, although people were very motivated to share their answers to the questionnaire because of the involvement of the role of the government. More adequate research can be conducted by expanding the study area, e.g., people from other countries.

The study could also be further improved by focusing on recovered patients and comparing different countries affected by COVID-19 using the proposed research model.
