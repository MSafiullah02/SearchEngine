            "text": "Influenza viruses are a worldwide problem for humanity. Early detection of influenza is the most effective way to protect against the flu [1]. Many influenza transmission events are suspected to occur via aerosolized virus [2], travelling via self-contained liquid droplets of less than 5 \u00b5m diameter [3\u20135]. These small droplets can remain airborne from minutes to hours and can therefore lead to a far-reaching spread of airborne infection. A recent report [6] expresses the urgent need for expedited research on influenza transmission to develop effective prevention and control strategies during an influenza epidemic. It is important to detect airborne influenza virus particles before they exceed a critical infection concentration in an indoor environment. Effective sampling of virus particles combined with highly sensitive methods of detection could enable fast, early detection of airborne influenza viruses. A successful effective approach for sampling airborne influenza virus particles that is suitable for home appliances was recently demonstrated [7]. Combining such a virus particle sampler and a sensor working in solution could be very effective for virus detection. For this, it could suffice to develop a sensor for virus detection in solution. Much more progress has been achieved in detecting virus particles in solution than in air. Sensors for influenza virus detection require several properties for use in home appliances: they should be label-free; have long lifetime durability, high sensitivity and selectivity; be insensitive to environmental conditions; and have a low cost and simple production methods.",

Some groups have suggested the use of aptamers as receptor molecules [10,11]. Aptamers are synthetic analogues of antibodies with a long lifetime, but their affinity crucially depends on the spatial conformation of the aptamer molecules, which could be dramatically affected by environmental conditions. For example, temperature and pH control could be problematic in some home conditions. We previously pioneered the use of a synthetic sialylglycopolymer receptor on a cantilever transducer for sensitive, label-free, long-term virus detection [12]. We used a nanomechanical cantilever system with commercial cantilevers to measure surface stress in our previous work. A complicated optical laser system was used to measure the cantilever deflection induced by viruses binding to the receptor layer, and this approach is not suitable for home appliances due to technical issues.",

            "text": "Several different virus families, including Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae and Parvoviridae, use sialoglycoconjugates for attachment [13]. Some viruses bind preferentially to sialic acids attached via a particular glycosidic linkage, and this specificity can contribute to the virus host range, tissue tropism and pathogenesis. Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae, which show a near obligatory dependence on the host cell surface sialoglycoprotein composition for infection. While Influenza B and C are human pathogens and use specific sialic receptors for attachment (respectively, Neu5Ac\u03b12-6Gal and Neu5,9Ac2), Influenza A viruses circulate in a wide range of avian and mammalian hosts, which determine their preferred receptor. Human Influenza A virus predominantly binds to the Neu5Ac\u03b12-6Gal sialoglycoconjugate, while avian Influenza A virus exclusively binds to Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal. It was recently shown that even a third saccharide in the oligosaccharide chain could also affect the affinity of the receptor to different subtypes of Influenza A viruses. Nevertheless, all species of Influenza A viruses from different hosts could bind different types of sialylglycan receptors to a varying degree, and it is hence impossible to specify an exact range of specificity [14]. Therefore, a sialoglycoconjugate receptor could be used to detect a wide range of influenza virus subtypes. Because it could also bind some other enveloped viruses, such a sensor could generate an alarm signal for further investigation of the detected pathogen. We previously demonstrated that oligosaccharides could be used as the receptor sequence to bind a certain subtype of Influenza A viruses using a stress-based mechanical sensor. We propose using a polymer matrix as the carrier for inertness and stable synthetic sialyloligosaccharide sequences. Using biologically active carbohydrate ligands is preferable, to extend the lifetime beyond the commonly used biological receptors based on natural antibodies [15\u201317]. It was previously shown that oligosaccharide sequences do not affect the overall receptor stability [18,19]. Using sialic saccharides instead of antibodies to detect antigenic drift of influenza virus is promising [20]. Several groups have recently developed sensors based on sialic saccharides [21,22]. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and electrochemical detection systems were used in these papers and showed good sensitivity but could also be quite sensitive to non-specific massive electrically charged airborne particles.",

Virion adsorption to the 3\u2032SL-PAA led to surface stress due to attractive intermolecular lateral forces in the receptor layer. MEMS have incomparable advantages due to the complex of electronic and atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. MEMS sensor sensitivity depends not only on the effect of mass loading but also the surface stress induced in the sensor layer by binding specific target molecules [31]. Here, we describe rapid, label-free detection of Influenza A viruses using the first radial mode of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric discs with a 2 mm radius and 100 \u00b5m thickness fabricated from a piezoelectric membrane. Piezo discs coated with a synthetic sialylglycopolymer receptor layer are inserted in a flowing virus suspension. Label-free detection of the virus is achieved by monitoring the disc radial mode resonance frequency shift due to surface stress induced in the sensor layer by binding viruses. We demonstrate label-free, selective, sensitive detection of influenza virus particles in principle for home appliances using a well-characterized sialic acid based receptor.",

Changes in the mechanical properties of the receptor layer immobilized on the piezoceramic cantilever due to the interaction with target molecules can dramatically shift the resonance peak of the longitudinal extension mode. According to Shih et al. [37], the relative resonance frequency shift \u0394f/f is independent of the length and width of the piezoelectric cantilevers and is only proportional to the surface stress s resulting from virus binding and inversely proportional to the thickness h of the resonator: \u0394f/f \u221d s/h, where f is the initial resonance frequency and \u0394f is the resonance frequency shift defined as the difference in the resonance frequency of the cantilever in solution before and after exposure to virus particles (figure 6).\n",

Commercially available cheap piezo plates with a 100 \u00b5m thickness were used as a PZT substrate for our resonators. Piezo discs were produced using a common drilling machine with a chopped carbide grade. This affordable method allows scalable production of disc-shaped resonators 4 mm in diameter (diameter depends on the size of the chopped cutter). We developed a special holder with central clamping (figure 3) to contact both sides of a disc. In this case, we performed experiments at the radial mode with the form of oscillation shown in figure 4. These oscillations are very similar to the longitudinal extension mode of rectangular piezo cantilevers. Using the radial mode of oscillation can exclude much of the influence of liquid on the resonance properties of the sensor. Resonance peaks of the piezo disc in water and air are presented in figure 3. 3\u2032SL-PAA polymer immobilized on a piezo disc surface was chosen as the virus detection sensor layer (figure 6). Its synthetic origin provides the long lifetime of the receptor layer, which is crucial in sensors for home appliance [33\u201335]. Here, we propose using a polymer base with linked sialyloligosaccharides as the receptor layer on piezo discs for virus detection to increase the level of surface stress of the layer generated during biospecific binding. Polyacrylamide conjugates bearing Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4Glc\u03b2 are strongly attached to the gold surface of discs modified with 4-aminothiophenol.

The first image (figure 7a) demonstrates the presence of particles (globular features) 20\u201350 nm in height, which we identify as influenza virions bound specifically to the sensor surface. In the second image (figure 7b), we observe the disappearance of some particles (e.g. inside the marked areas), which can be explained by shifts due to the AFM tip during scanning. The appearance of holes (with apparent depth \u2248 10 nm and width over 100 nm) at the positions of the viral particles after their removal (see enlarged areas in figure 7c,d) indicate that bound virions are partially embedded in the polymer matrix.\n",

            "text": "Interactions between the virions and receptor layer lead to additional lateral forces [39] or additional stiffness [37], which can not only cause a negative shift in the resonance frequency of the disc, but also increase the frequency of the resonator [37]. In current experiments, the adsorption of virions from solution to the polymer receptor layer generated a positive shift in resonance frequency. We obtained meaningful differences between the frequency shifts for concentrations of 0, 105, 106 and 107 virions ml\u22121. Steady-state resonance shifts for different concentrations and the experimental dependence of the frequency shift on the concentration are presented in figure 8. The resonance frequency shift is proportional to the surface stress of the receptor layer immobilized on the sensor substrate described by the Langmuir adsorption model. We recently showed that attaining the steady-state value of surface stress induced by virus adsorption takes several minutes [12,40]. Hence, the same time is required to attain the steady-state resonance shifts. Allantoic liquid containing various proteins was used as the zero probe. It did not change the receptor layer stress in contrast to solutions containing virus particles. It was confirmed that 3\u2032SL-PAA receptors are highly specific to virions over other proteins. We obtained results with concentrations of 105 virions ml\u22121 and a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 4. Sensitivity can be easily increased several fold by using a thinner PZT substrate because the sensitivity is inversely proportional to the thickness of the resonator. Applying Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3\u2013PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) or other materials with better electromechanical constants could also improve the sensor quality. Using piezo discs with a smaller diameter should increase the sensitivity because the density of viruses in the receptor layer would be higher. The periodic noise in all graphs could be caused by the peristaltic pump. This could be avoided by optimizing the flow system.\n",

In our previous paper, we measured the surface stress generation in synthetic sialylglycopolymer receptor layer [12] by virus specific sorption. We observed a proportional increase of surface stress induced by virus solutions with different concentrations. There is a nonlinear dependence of surface stress on virus concentration related to the limited number of receptor moieties on the polymer layer immobilized on the sensor substrate. The experimental dependence of \u0394f/f \u221d s presented in figure 12 has a good linear interpolation that confirms the origin of the resonance frequency shift by surface stress generation.

Laboratory and field methods can also be distinguished. Most of them are still oriented toward clinical diagnostics, but some can be used for environmental monitoring. The \u2018gold standard\u2019 for diagnostics are conventional PCR and ELISA, which are suitable for clinical use. Many novel methods based on improvement of traditional approaches or completely new technologies help to overcome limitations of traditional methods by increasing sensitivity, decreasing analysis time and extending the applicability. It is very complicated to compare the sensitivities of different methods because different units are used by researchers to define virus concentrations. These could be virus particles, plaque-forming units (PFUs), haemagglutination units (HAUs), molecular or weight concentrations of viruses or viral proteins. For example, for Influenza A virus particle-to-PFU ratio could be greater than 10 : 1 [41]. Table 1 presents a comparison of recent developments in influenza virus sensing on several features. We can conclude that our method shows good detection time and sensitivity as compared with others [42,43]. Several methods can show better characteristics in limit of detection (LOD) [11] or detection time [8] but are inferior in protection against non-specific binding or lifetime stability because antibodies are used. Using linear sweep voltammetry [44] for neuraminidase detection shows good stability and applicability but has poor sensitivity and selectivity due to association of NA with some bacterial infections.\n",

The interaction between virus particles and the receptor layer on the surface of PZT discs leads to an increased frequency of the radial oscillation mode. This increase may be due to intermolecular forces in the receptor layer, which can add additional strain to the resonator system. The use of the radial oscillation mode allows excluding much of the influence of media on the resonance properties of the sensor. We detected viruses at concentrations of 105 virions ml\u22121 and demonstrated meaningful differences between the frequency shifts for concentrations of 0, 105, 106 and 107 virions ml\u22121. Sensitivity can be easily increased several-fold using a thinner PZT substrate, because it is inversely proportional to the thickness of the resonator. The suggested sensor satisfied the detection time and reproducibility requirements for home appliance use. We demonstrated that PZT discs with a PAA-3\u2032SL receptor layer can be successfully regenerated. Two consecutive flow regenerations of the sensor in a 10% urea water solution led to sensitivity loss of less than 20%. We demonstrated the principle of label-free, selective, sensitive detection of Influenza A virus particles that can potentially be used to detect pathogens in home appliances.",
