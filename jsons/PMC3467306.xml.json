There is a great degree of variability in terms of the families and numbers of AMPs encoded by the genome of each species. It is likely that the repertoire of AMPs elaborated by each species is a reflection of their environmental niche, mainly the pathogens that they individually encounter. Importantly, altered expression of AMPs in certain disease states, such as canine and human AD, and psoriasis in humans, predisposes the host to secondary infection or exacerbation of ongoing inflammation, respectively. Further studies of AMPs in veterinary species are needed to define the expression of these peptides, determine genetic variations, evaluate antimicrobial activities, as well as other functions, and investigate their role in disease.",
