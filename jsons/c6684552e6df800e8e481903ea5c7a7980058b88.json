[1] Due to their unique properties in photoluminescence, water solubility, biocompatibility, and resistance to photobleaching as well as cost-effective synthesis and low toxicity, CDs have been extensively investigated, [2] [3] [4] and are widely utilized in bio-imaging, bio-sensing, biolabeling, photodynamic therapy, and drug delivery. [5, 6] CDs have a small size and controllable surface functional groups, which facilitate their high adsorption interactions with different biological surfaces. [7] Recently, functionalized CDs synthesized by hydrothermal method have been shown to have antiviral activity. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] However, the antiviral mechanism of these CDs remains to be further elucidated, and the response of cells to them is still unknown.",

[15] Under the conditions of high cost of antiviral drugs and limited healthcare resources, Chinese herbs have been recommended to prevent and treat respiratory disease and herpes simplex in China, especially in poor regions. [16, 17] To date, no critically appraised evidence is available on the beneficial effect of Chinese herbal medicines on H1N1 influenza, mainly due to lack of both repeated test of intervention and placebo-controlled trial. [18, 19] Furthermore, Chinese herbal poisoning incidents have also been reported. [20, 21] As a common Chinese herbal medicine and a major component of glycyrrhiza uralensis, glycyrrhizic acid has been characterized with various biological activities, such as antiviral immunoregulation, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and liver protection. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Owing to the ability to inhibit multidrug-resistance-associated proteins, glycyrrhetate and glycyrrhizic acid are used in clinic for cisplatin resistance reversal in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and reduction in liver damage. [27] [28] [29] [30] However, glycyrrhizic acid also has the disadvantages of poor water solubility and certain cytotoxicity.

[32] PRRS virus (PRRSV), an enveloped single positive-strand RNA virus, is the With the gradual usage of carbon dots (CDs) in the area of antiviral research, attempts have been stepped up to develop new antiviral CDs with high biocompatibility and antiviral effects. In this study, a kind of highly biocompatible CDs (Gly-CDs) is synthesized from active ingredient (glycyrrhizic acid) of Chinese herbal medicine by a hydrothermal method.",

As shown by the HR-TEM image in Figure 1a , Gly-CDs were round shaped and well-dispersed with a uniform size distribution. Figure 1b showed the size distribution of Gly-CDs measured with a dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyzer. Consistent with the TEM image, Gly-CDs showed high monodispersity, with a calculated average size of 11.4 nm. As shown by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Figure 1c , Gly-CDs possessed the component of amorphous carbon due to the broad peak at around 20\u00b0. [48] The sharp peak at around 14.9\u00b0 may be ascribed to the crystallinity of Gly-CDs, and the graphitic carbon accounted for only a small amount of Gly-CDs carbon, so no apparent lattice fringe could be observed in the TEM image. [49] The above results provide evidence that the Gly-CDs are polymeric CDs.",

            "text": "The UV-vis absorption and fluorescence (FL) spectra of the Gly-CDs are presented in Figure 1d . The tiny absorption peak at 260 nm was attributed to \u03c0-\u03c0* transition. The Gly-CDs possessed a significant characteristic blue fluorescence at 438 nm, with the maximal excitation wavelength remaining at 356 nm. Meanwhile, excitation-dependent fluorescence emission was observed when Gly-CDs were excited with different wavelengths from 300 to 410 nm (Figure 1e ), due to the normal size distribution of Gly-CDs. [50] The UV-vis absorption spectrum and fluorescence spectrum are all consistent with CDs reported before. [49, 51] Figure 1f shows the Gly-CDs functional groups measured by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). In the spectra of Gly-CDs, five obvious absorption peaks could be observed at 3430, 2947, 1621, 1408, and 1051 cm \u22121 , corresponding, respectively, to O\ue0c6H, C\ue0c6H, C \ue0cb C, C \ue0cb O, and C\ue0c6O, indicating that Gly-CDs are rich in \ue0c6OH and \ue0c6COOH on the surface. [52] The results obtained from the preliminary analysis of the FT-IR spectrum proved that the Gly-CDs conserved part functional groups of glycyrrhizic acid. The elemental constituents and functional groups of Gly-CDs were further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 1g shows the full-scan spectrum of Gly-CDs. The two peaks of C 1s and O 1s could be obviously recognized at 285 and 532 eV, respectively. The elemental analysis demonstrated that Gly-CDs contained 78.25% of carbon and 21.48% of oxygen. The high resolution XPS spectra of the C1s in Gly-CDs could be resolved into three peaks (Figure 1h ). The peak at 284.5 eV was assigned to C \ue0cb O of the carboxylic groups, while the other two peaks at 286.5 and 288.2 eV were ascribed, respectively, to C\ue0c6O and C\ue0c6C/C \ue0cb C. [53, 54] The citric-acid-based CDs (Cit-CDs) were used to act as the contrast, because citric acid and ethylenediamine, the raw materials, do not show antiviral activity. We prepared biocompatible Cit-CDs using the method described in the Supporting Information. [50] As can be seen from TEM and DLS images, the average size of the Cit-CDs was 6.0 nm ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information). As shown in Figure S2 , Supporting Information, a characteristic absorption peak could be observed at 340 nm by UV-vis absorption spectrum, the maximum emission of the Cit-CDs was centered at 455 nm whereas the maximum excitation was recorded at 349 nm in the FL excitation and emission spectra. The results of the FT-IR spectrum suggested that the Cit-CDs were rich in \ue0c6COOH and \ue0c6NH 2 on the surface while the 1 H NMR spectrum indicating the Cit-CDs are highly carbonized. Figure S3 , Supporting Information displays the full scan XPS spectrum of Cit-CDs, and elemental analysis indicated that the Cit-CDs consisted of 67.81% of carbon, 13.63% of nitrogen, and 18.56% of oxygen.",

Reducing the ROS level by their inhibitors can inhibit virus proliferation. It is reported that the intracellular ROS levels can be successfully regulated to suppress viral infection by embedding poly(aniline-co-pyrrole) within an amphiphilic methoxy polyethylene glycol-blockpolyphenylalanine copolymer. [68] Another study has shown that silver nanoparticle-based codelivery of oseltamivir could remarkably inhibit the accumulation of ROS and activate the signaling pathways of AKT and p53 phosphorylation to inhibit H1N1 influenza virus infection. [69] Whether Gly-CDs can regulate the cellular ROS level was investigated in this study. Briefly, after PRRSV infection for 1-2 h, the MARC-145 cells were treated separately with Gly-CDs for 12 h, then an inverted fluorescence microscope was used to detect the cellular ROS levels by detecting the fluorescence of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF).

Briefly, MARC-145 cells were incubated or mock-incubated (DMEM containing 2% serum) with Gly-CDs at 0.30 mg mL \u22121 for 24 h. Subsequently, a series of experiment was carried out according to the experimental flow chart of Scheme S2, Supporting Information, the quality test results of the collected cell samples indicate that the samples meet the quality requirements ( Figure S6, Supporting Information) . Furthermore, a total of 60 036 peptides and 7364 proteins were identified by searching against the Macaca mulatta Uniprot Proteome database, including 31 proteins that are differentially expressed (total protein data and differentially expressed protein data can be found in the attached excel). A dot-plot was also supplied to present the overview of quantified proteins and differentially expressed cellular proteins ( Figure S7 , Supporting Information). Among them, seven differentially expressed proteins and two non-differentially expressed proteins were detected by Western blot assay to validate the liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data. In Figure 8a , it was shown that in Gly-CDs-treated cells, the expressions were downregulated in thioredoxin-like protein 1 (TXNL1), nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), and olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4), Small 2020, 16, 1906206 upregulated in cathepsin D (CTSD), colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), and pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), and not significantly changed in 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSPD1), and mitochondrial and vimentin (VIM). The gray value was converted to the quantitative result by ImageJ software and the ratios (Gly-CDs/Control) identified by Western blot assay were consistent with those from iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis.",

DDX60 is a novel antiviral helicase promoting RIG-I-like receptor-mediated signaling.

[30] In this study, 0.30 mg mL \u22121 Gly-CDs inhibited PRRSV proliferation with \u22485 orders of magnitude, indicating that the Gly-CDs increase the antiviral activity of glycyrrhizic acid. In a recent study, Lin et al. reported that the curcumin-carbon quantum dots had higher antiviral effect than curcumin on the proliferation of enterovirus 71, which is in agreement with our results. [77] As shown by the infrared spectra in Figure 1f , Gly-CDs were similar to glycyrrhizic acid in structure, with most functional groups of glycyrrhizic acid being maintained during the formation of Gly-CDs. However, Gly-CDs have large surface area and more contact sites as compared with glycyrrhizic acid, leading to polyvalent interactions with the virus and thus higher antiviral activity than glycyrrhizic acid, similar to the enhanced antiviral activity of gold nanoparticles capped with mercaptoethanesulfonate. [79, 80] The TEM images of PRRSV with and without Gly-CDs ( Figure S10 , Supporting Information) also proved that Gly-CDs could interact with PRRSV directly, which may result in inhibition of PRRSV proliferation. Gly-CDs were found to inhibit PRRSV invasion and replication, which is a more significant physiological process. However, the visual exploration of Gly-CDs in the virus penetration process is difficult and needs to be improved in further studies.",

[77] In our study, the control (Cit-CDs) was used mainly to explore the influence of the synthetic materials of CDs on their antiviral activity. The results (Figure 3) showed that Cit-CDs had no significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of PRRSV, indicating that the source of CDs had an important effect on their antiviral activity. What is more, we compared the anti-PRRSV activity of Gly-CDs prepared under hydrothermal reaction for different time periods (7 h, 14 h) ( Figure S11 , Supporting Information). The inhibitory effect of 14h-Gly-CDs was shown to be inferior to that of 7h-Gly-CDs, probably due to difference in functional groups of CDs. This suggests the potential relationship of the functional groups on the surface of Gly-CDs with antiviral activity, which needs further study.",

The induction of ISG expression is a classical broad antiviral pathway for elucidating the antiviral mechanism. [81] Gly-CDs can induce the upregulation of IFN-stimulating genes, which can be the main reason for its potential use as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, including PEDV and PRV. However, Gly-CDs appear to exhibit stronger antiviral activity against RNA viruses (PRRSV and PEDV in this study) than DNA viruses (PRV in this study). Previous studies demonstrated that CDs can induce the production of IFN and IFN-stimulating genes. [10] However, viruses vary in their susceptibility to interferon, implying the Gly-CDs may also vary in antiviral activity against different viruses. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility of other unidentified mechanisms attributed to the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of Gly-CDs.",

The antiviral mechanism of Gly-CDs was demonstrated from inactivation of PRRSV in vitro, inhibition of PRRSV invasion and replication, stimulation of cells to produce interferon, inhibition of ROS production induced by PRRSV infection.

All solutions were prepared with deionized water from a Millipore water purification system. Briefly, the Gly-CDs were synthesized with a modified one-pot hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis route, 0.10 g (0.12 mmol) glycyrrhizic acid was dissolved in 10 mL deionized water, followed by adding dropwise saturated NaOH aqueous solution to adjust the pH to 10.0 \u00b1 0.2, transferring the mixture into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and incubation at 180 \u00b0C for 7 h (Gly-CDs). After cooling to room temperature naturally, large precipitate was removed from the mixture by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min, followed by collecting the supernatant and filtering through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter to further remove small precipitate. Finally, the Gly-CDs were obtained by dialysis against deionized water for 8 h with a cut-off molecular weight 14 kDa dialysis bag, with the deionized water being changed every 2 h during dialysis. The Gly-CDs powders were then collected and freeze-dried for further usage. The quantum yield of the Gly-CDs was measured to be 1.41%, using quinine sulfate as reference.",
