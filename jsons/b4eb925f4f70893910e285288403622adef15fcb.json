In this general setting, its characterization as the spectral radius of next generation operators is rather elegant, but simultaneously poses serious obstacles to its practical determination. In this work we address the problem numerically by reducing the relevant operators to matrices through a pseudospectral collocation, eventually computing the sought quantity by solving finite-dimensional eigenvalue problems. The approach is illustrated for two classes of models, respectively from ecology and epidemiology. Several numerical tests demonstrate experimentally important features of the method, like fast convergence and influence of the smoothness of the models' coefficients. Examples of robust analysis of instances of specific models are also presented to show potentialities and ease of application.",

The general outcome is a more reliable tool, with faster convergence ideally of infinite order (known as spectral accuracy, see, e.g., [29] ). This represents a great advantage compared to the finite-order convergence of [16, 25] , as it translates into much more accurate approximations obtained with much smaller matrices. As a consequence the required computational load reduces, in terms of both time and memory usage. The latter is a favorable feature when stability and bifurcation analyses are the final target in presence of varying or uncertain model parameters, and of course this is frequently the case in realistic contexts.",

This choice potentially serves as a basis for extending the proposed method to more involved systems of population dynamics (e.g., with several structuring variables). If a structured epidemic model describing the novel pandemia of coronavirus was available, such as Model B or any of its extensions, this method could be applied to compute R 0 for different values of the parameters.",

Moreover, the rank of B is typically lower than that of B \u2212 M, which is an advantage for R 0 . Finally, extra evolutionary aspects added to the models are more often related to R 0 than to r.

The spectrally accurate behavior (namely the error decays faster than O(N \u2212k ) for any natural k, [29] ) is evident in Figure 4 .1 (left) for the approximation of both R 0 and the relevant generalized eigenfunction \u03c6. To note that for the former the approximation is already very good for low even values of N, due to the (anti-) symmetry properties of the Chebyshev differentiation matrix H N [29] . Similar trends emerge also in the right panel, where (4. In the previous tests both R 0 and the relevant generalized eigenfunction are analytically known. As the same is not possible for case (A3), we show in Figure 4 .3 only the error on R 0 with respect to a reference value R 0,N as explained at the beginning of Section 4.1. As expected, the convergence is spectrally accurate for case (A3.1), in whichD = 1 ensures compactness of the next generation operator (according to [8] ). Theoretically, alsoD = 10 \u22126 = 0 in case (A3.2) guarantees compactness, but it is clearly visible from the plot that much larger values of N are necessary to start appreciating the spectral accuracy. It is indeed reasonable to expect that the value of D affects the error constants, causing their increase asD \u2192 0, still being the problem compact. When we deal instead with case (A3. 3) , in which the absence of diffusion causes the loss of compactness, convergence still occurs, even though at a fixed rate (seemingly linear). The fact is somehow surprising (and certainly merits future investigation), given that without compactness (2.9) may even become meaningless and we are thus using a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem to approximate components of the spectrum possibly other than the point one. As a final remark for model A, let us mention that all the eigenfunctions computed with the proposed approach in case (A3) turned out to approximate seemingly smooth curves (as they are expected to be).

First of all, let us recall that the generalized eigenfunction (4.7) is a polynomial of degree 5, justifying the sudden drop of the error to machine precision occurring with N = 6 in both the left and right panels. The theoretical proof of convergence fully elaborated in [8] shows that this indeed happens at N = 6 and not already at N = 5 as one may expect. As far as the approximation of R 0 is concerned, instead, the same behavior is ensured if enough regularity is provided, as it is the case for \u03b1 = 1 in the right panel. In fact, for instance, it is evident from (4.5) that \u03a0 0 is smooth for \u03b1 \u2265 1, but for \u03b1 < 1 it becomes rational and blows up at x = l. Indeed, the choice \u03b1 = 1/4 in the left panel prevents the method to perform the standard spectral accuracy, and convergence of fixed order (seemingly 4) occurs. That the regularity of the model ingredients plays a role in the convergence analysis is a general fact, but for the specific problem currently investigated we leave the elaboration of the necessary details to [8] . Finally, the analysis of case (B3) reveals spectral accuracy again, Figure 4 .6.

For the former\u03bc = 1 and both cases (A3.1) and (A3.2) are considered. For the latter \u00b5 = 50 and\u03b2 = 10. As expected, R 0 grows with respect to the fertility from zero up to the asymptote R 0 = 2, since we assumed symmetric division (2.17), with larger diffusion values favoring the speed of increase. Instead interestingly, at fixed fertility, there is a single peak with respect to the diffusion, i.e. there exist an intermediate diffusion maximizing the basic reproduction number. At this point, a naive approach is that a population adopting such strategy would persist and become an unbeatable population. 9 Computationally speaking, both figures are obtained by repeatedly computing R 0 with respect to the varying parameter upon discretizing the latter on a mesh of P = 1 000 points, procedure that took on average just few seconds (say 1 to 5).",
