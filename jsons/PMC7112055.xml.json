During this cycle the virus utilizes and transforms the machinery of the cell for the biosynthesis of the own genetic material, proteins, and lipids. This can lead to vast reorganization in the subcellular organization inside the cell (Risco et al., 2014; Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014). The size of most viruses is beyond the resolution limit of optical microscopy, and only electron microscopy (EM) provides the resolution required to study viruses and their life cycles (Pelchen-Matthews and Marsh, 2007).",

            "text": "The technical specifications of an electron microscope are, however, only one part of the equation to deliver insight into the viral life cycle within the host cell. The first obstacle comes from the dynamic nature of the virus cycle. Infection, replication, virus particle morphogenesis and egress are different, consecutive steps. But in contrast to optical microscopy, EM does not permit the observation of the same object over time. This aspect can be solved with the study of different samples after finding the right time post-infection for each step. Next to the dynamics of these different steps during viral infection, another challenge arises from their topology: only entry and release of the viral particle take place at the surface of the host cell. All other steps utilize machineries inside the cell and their study requires the analysis of the morphology of the cell interior. For this reason, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with thin sections of infected cells has been for a long time the standard approach to study the intracellular aspects of virus life cycles. However, the morphology of a cell is three-dimensional and thus random thin sections provide a limited view. As pointed out more than 60 years ago, the impact of EM for the morphological analysis of viruses depends highly on technological progress on sample preparation (Hillier, 1950). Since this time, sample preparation as well as the sensitivity of electron microscopes and their detectors has evolved to a great extent and different approaches for tomography were developed to study samples in 3D. But the key point raised at that time has remained: each sample preparation/imaging technique produces artifacts and it is important to be aware of them and be critical about the amount of information that can be extracted. Simultaneously with the technological development, our knowledge about the life cycle of viruses has increased, and the diversity of the questions addressed has increased concomitantly. It is often required to combine different approaches to answer the question at hand. Therefore, this review will focus on the different preparation and imaging techniques that are used to visualize the cell biology of viral infections (Fig. 1\n). We will discuss the technological basis of the different approaches and the findings they made possible. In particular, we will focus on the characterization of virus factories and virus replication organelles. Viruses express their fundamental biological properties during the intracellular stage of their life cycle, which in most cases takes place within virus factories (Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro et al., 2013). Viral factories (VF) are intracellular membranous compartments harboring viral replication organelles (RO) that contain viral replication complexes (VRC) and the sites of virus particle assembly (Harak and Lohmann, 2015; Novoa et al., 2005). VRCs are often located in single-membrane vesicles known as spherules, but also in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), flat membranes and cubic/convoluted membranes (CM) (Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro et al., 2013). To build these neoorganelles, viruses manipulate lipid synthesis and flows to create platforms with particular lipid composition and biophysical properties that facilitate viral genome replication (Altan-Bonnet, 2017; Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro et al., 2016; Fern\u00e1ndez-Oliva et al., 2019). Due to their complex composition and functions, virus factories could be contemplated as the living state of viruses (Fridmann-Sirkis et al., 2016). Two main pathways have been identified so far as being responsible for viral factory biogenesis: aggresome formation for DNA viruses and autophagy for RNA viruses (Abernathy et al., 2019; Jackson et al., 2005; Kajitani et al., 2013; Wileman, 2007).",

            "text": "Despite the focus on EM of this review we must highlight light microscopy (LM) as a great ally of electron microscopists. This is due to the ability of LM to characterize dynamic changes in the cell associated to viral infection, albeit with less resolution but with shorter times for sample preparation. Furthermore, new advances in fluorescent probes and LM methods are providing new insights into the cell biology of viruses. Very interesting recent reviews deal with light microscopy of viral infections (Alonas et al., 2016; Dirk et al., 2016; Hanne et al., 2016; Witte et al., 2018). However, microscopy of fixed cells provides static views of complex, dynamic events. To study multi-step processes such as a virus infection, time-course assays are useful and provide data that we try to organize sequentially. Nevertheless, during viral infections what we perceive as a logical sequence of events might not correspond to reality, and many findings would have never been uncovered without dynamic, real time, live cell microscopy. Live-cell imaging of viral infections has been mainly focused on processes of entry and release of viral particles (Baktash et al., 2018; Francis and Melikyan, 2018; Jouvenet et al., 2008) but has shown great potential to study all steps of the virus replication cycle (Campbell and Hope, 2008). Live cell microscopy can also reveal a heterogeneous response of cells to infection (Movie 1\n, Fig. 2). When mammalian cells infected with a fluorescent bunyavirus (Shi et al., 2010) are studied by live cell imaging, it can be observed that some cells rapidly build a virus factory and produce many progeny viruses (Fig. 2, cell 1), a few cells die soon (Fig. 2, cell 2) and some others apparently do not get infected (Fig. 2, cell 3). Indeed, some cells receive the fluorescent virus and pass it to neighboring cells while remaining apparently non-infected (Fig. 2, cell 4). These findings demonstrate that cells in the cultured cell monolayer are not identical and respond to virus infection heterogeneously.",

Video-microscopy showed that all infected cells went through three different stages of infection, early, acute and persistent, something that can be fully appreciated only when following each single cell in real time (L\u00f3pez-Montero and Risco, 2011). Live-cell imaging has been used to study the biogenesis, dynamics and trafficking of viral replicative structures. Remarkably, these studies have shown that unrelated viruses such as Vaccinia Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, rotaviruses and the mouse hepatitis coronavirus, assemble small replication organelles that move through the cytoplasm in a microtubule-dependent manner, together with larger replication platforms that are rather immobile (Baktash and Randall, 2019; Eichwald et al., 2012; Eyre et al., 2014; Hagemeijer et al., 2010; Schramm et al., 2006; W\u00f6lk et al., 2008). Live-cell imaging has also shown the transformation of cell compartments induced by viruses to build their replication organelles. This is the case of the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 that disassembles the Golgi complex (Van der Schaar et al., 2016) or the human reovirus that remodels the endoplasmic reticulum to build viral inclusions (Tenorio et al., 2018). New probes for imaging viral RNA will be powerful tools to study viral replication and assembly in live cells (Alonas et al., 2016).",

Cells have to be grown on special plates with a clear bottom made of plastic or glass and plated with an appropriate confluence, usually 70% or less. A previous time-course study by confocal microscopy of fixed cells is important to determine the best time post-infection for launching the live cell imaging recording. To limit potential effects caused by phototoxicity, the right choice of fluorescent proteins, light intensity, exposure time and time interval between frame acquisitions will be critical (Magidson and Khodjakov, 2013; Icha et al., 2017).",

The second, main restrain introduced by electrons is the thickness of the sample: only thin samples can be observed by TEM, whereas most biological samples are soft, which makes the preparation of thin slices impossible.",

For morphological studies, conventional TEM preparation at room temperature (RT) relies on aldehyde fixation (Sabatini et al., 1963), followed by a post-fixation with osmium to stabilize lipids (White et al., 1976), and dehydration to replace gradually the water of the sample by an organic solvent. In the final step, the sample is infiltrated with a plastic resin, which becomes hard after polymerization and allows the preparation of thin sections for TEM. In this procedure, each step has well documented artifacts (Kellenberger, 1991), which have to be taken into account. But it should also not be forgotten that these sample preparation protocols have contributed to a vast basis of knowledge before alternative sample preparation methods became available. Characteristic viral factories as seen by TEM of ultrathin sections after conventional embedding are shown in Fig. 3\n. In mammalian BHK-21 cells, Bunyamwera virus assembles a large cytoplasmic factory using Golgi complex stacks, ER and mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Characteristic spherules with VRCs are formed in Golgi membranes (Fontana et al., 2008) where progeny viruses are assembled (Fig. 3B and C).",

Two extensive handbooks give an idea about this field, which showed over the last years a very dynamic development and continues to do so (M\u00fcller-Reichert and Verkade, 2012, M\u00fcller-Reichert and Verkade, 2014). Therefore, this section does not aim to be exhaustive but should outline examples of different strategies. In general, the different approaches can be defined by the complementing aspects that light microscopy (LM) and EM have in their combination. The light microscope offers an unmatched field of view compared to EM, together with the above discussed possibility of imaging the dynamics of the living sample. On the other side, EM allows to visualize the sample at a higher resolution and in all the structural context of the cell and not only the structures labeled for the light microscope. The different approaches can be grouped: (1) To use the field of view from the light microscope and find a rare event by fluorescent labeling in a population of cells or tissue. After imaging by LM, the sample can be prepared by different methods for EM. (2) Characterize a dynamic process by LM and fix the sample at the event of interest to study it in the context of the cell. (3) Visualize your protein of interest in the context of the cell. Often this approach is done with LM and EM on sections or with cryo-fluorescence followed by cryo-TEM on plunge frozen cells. The latter is reviewed elsewhere (Wolff et al., 2016).",

This support can be photoetched glass coverslips or gridded plastic dishes for conventional preparation, sapphire discs with a carbon pattern for high pressure freezing (HPF), or a finder grid for plunge freezing (Madela et al., 2014; Santarella-Mellwig et al., 2018; Tenorio et al., 2018). The pattern on the substrate allows to localize the cell of interest by phase contrast. After embedding in resin the pattern is present on the surface of the resin and will allow to locate the area with the cell of interest and prepare serial sections. A visual example of correlation is shown in Fig. 4\n. For tissue, transfer of coordinates provides often a challenge. Fluorescent dyes can be used to highlight specific structures of tissues and create internal landmarks to position the region of interest and embed the samples for EM in such a way that the fluorescence is retained, and either the block or the sections can be imaged by LM (Lucas et al., 2012). Another approach introduced landmarks on the surface of the tissue by an infrared laser (Karreman et al., 2014).",

It can be done on Tokuyasu sections (Oorschot et al., 2014), or on methacrylate resins (Kukulski et al., 2011). For both methods, protocols are available that can preserve the fluorescent signal of fluorescent fusion proteins. Alternatively, antibody labeling can be done on sections (Oorschot et al., 2014; Schwarz and Humbel, 2014). The fluorescent signal can be observed in the LM and afterward the grids are contrasted and observed by EM. Because in the EM the section itself is devoid of landmarks, a first correlation can be obtained with a finder grid. Finer correlation is possible when the DNA inside the nuclei of cells is stained with DAPI or Hoechst for LM. Higher precision can be obtained when fluorescent spheres are applied as landmarks to the section, though this approach requires TEM tomography since the spheres are not visible in a 2D projection image. With this approach it was possible to detect a single HIV-eGFP-delEnv particle at the plasma membrane of a MDCK cell (Kukulski et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Live cell imaging combined with EM allows to study the dynamics of a process and arrest it at the point of interest with the aim of visualization within the context of the cell. The method of live cell imaging depends on the dynamics of the studied process and the resolution required. As mentioned above for imaging live cells, care needs to be taken to avoid phototoxicity. The ideal arrest of the cell after imaging would be cryofixation due to its rapidity. However, this is often limited by practical issues. Often a cryoplunge freezer or a high-pressure freezer are not localized next to a light microscope. And even if they are, the transfer has to be fast enough not to lose the benefit of rapid immobilization. Transfer should also avoid changes in the environment (temperature, physical bending on grid, etc.), which can influence the sample's morphology. Currently there are two ways to combine fast transfer of sapphire discs from the light microscope to a high-pressure freezer (Heiligenstein et al., 2014; Verkade, 2008), both of which allow a short time frame of live cell imaging before high pressure freezing. If biosafety or the length of imaging does not permit this, chemical fixation is mandatory. The delay of the fixation depends on the localization of the process inside the sample. For rat liver, a 4% Paraformaldehyde solution penetrated the tissue to a depth of 2.5 mm within 4 h, which corresponds on average to a penetration of about 170 nm/s (Dempster, 1960). Thus, for events near the plasma membrane like the transport of viral particles for release, chemical fixation will work faster than for the fixation of a viral factory in the centre of the cell. However, it might not be fast enough to visualize fusion or budding events at the plasma membrane. It is still recommendable to control the localization of the event of interest after chemical fixation by light microscopy before processing for EM, either by cryofixation (plunge freezing or high-pressure freezing/HPF), or conventional preparation.",

            "text": "CLEM approaches are advancing our understanding of the biogenesis of viral replication organelles (Bykov et al., 2016). Some interesting examples include the flaviviruses hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Dengue virus (DENV), the alphavirus Semliki Forest Virus (SFV), the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3, and the human reovirus. The genome replication sites of HCV have been located in a complex vesicular network interconnected with the ER known as the \u201cmembranous web\u201d (Paul et al., 2013). This structure originates by accumulation of ER-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). CLEM showed that NS5A, a phosphoprotein that facilitates viral replication by interacting with other viral non-structural proteins and cell factors, accumulates in double-membrane vesicles that locate close to lipid droplets, a key organelle for HCV morphogenesis (Filipe and McLauchlan, 2015; Romero-Brey et al., 2012). These results provided evidence of the spatial connection between HCV genome replication and viral particle morphogenesis inside viral factories. In the case of DENV, CLEM is assisting in the characterization of the biogenesis of the replication factories, in particular in the role of viral proteins in membrane remodeling and virion morphogenesis (Bykov et al., 2016; Scaturro et al., 2015). CLEM allowed the unambiguous identification of the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 replication organelle morphologies as a first step to understand the requirements for their biogenesis and their evolution over time (Van der Schaar et al., 2016). For the alphavirus SFV, CLEM demonstrated that the spherules with VRC are first formed on the plasma membrane to end up in cytoplasmic vacuoles upon internalization (Spuul et al., 2010). Viral and cell factors required for spherule biogenesis were also studied by CLEM (Kallio et al., 2013; Spuul et al., 2011). A combination of live cell imaging and CLEM unveiled that nascent reovirus replication organelles, known as viral inclusions (VI) are made of aggregates of tubules and vesicles originated by remodeling of the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum and that two reovirus non-structural proteins, \u03c3NS and \u03bcNS, are responsible for ER remodeling (Tenorio et al., 2018). Besides, CLEM has great potential for evaluating compounds to treat viral infections (Berger et al., 2014; Garc\u00eda-Serradilla et al., 2019; Lowen et al., 2018; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2014). For those interested in performing CLEM of virus-infected cells, detailed, step-by-step CLEM workflows describing sample preparation, imaging and correlation, have been published recently (Hellstr\u00f6m et al., 2015; Santarella-Mellwig et al., 2018).",

This results in a gradient: first proteins at the plasma membrane are inactivated, whereas intracellular organelles are reached by the fixative at a later time point. To circumvent this problem, an alternative is to freeze cells fast, which arrests them in their state in milliseconds. However, to keep all cellular structures in place, it is mandatory to vitrify the water in the sample and avoid formation of ice crystals during freezing. At atmospheric pressure this requires high cooling rates and allows only the vitrification up to a thickness of a few micrometers (Escaig, 1982). Bulk samples can be vitrified by high pressure freezing. In this approach, for a few milliseconds a pressure of more than 2000 bars is applied to the sample before cooling is applied (Riehle and Hoechli, 1973). Since water in the liquid state is almost incompressible, the application of the high pressure has no influence on the sample's morphology. But the pressure changes the physical properties of water by lowering the melting point and the temperature for homogenous ice nucleation (Kanno et al., 1975). Depending on the water content of the sample, this allows the vitrification of samples up to 200 \u03bcm thickness. After HPF, the sample can be processed and imaged in the frozen state by cryo-FIB (Focused Ion Beam)/cryo-TEM or by CEMOVIS (Cryo-Electron Microscopy of Vitreous Sections) (Hagen et al., 2015; Hayles et al., 2010). Most often the samples are processed by freeze substitution (FS). During FS, the water of the sample is replaced by an organic solvent that contains chemical fixatives to stabilize the sample during warm up. Here, the order of events is the reverse to the above described conventional preparation at RT: during FS the sample is first dehydrated (usually at \u2212 90 \u00b0C, where chemical fixatives are not active) and then fixed when the temperature is raised (Hurbain and Sachse, 2011). Dehydration in the cold avoids most artifacts of dehydration at RT (Kellenberger, 1991). Since the solvent is also the carrier of the fixatives, these are in place and ready to react with the sample and the gradient of fixation at RT is omitted as well. After dehydration, samples can be infiltrated with a resin that permits immunolabeling, such as Lowicryl- or LR-resins, or in epoxy resin for pure morphological studies.",

However, for virus-infected cells this raises the issue of biosafety. With one exception, most HPF machines are not mobile and it is impossible to move them into a BSL-2 or BSL-3 laboratory. In this case the sample should be inactivated by aldehyde fixation. The advantage of a fast immobilization is lost but a superior morphology can be achieved even with prefixed samples by HPF/FS compared to conventional preparation because the major harm to morphological preservation is caused by the dehydration step at RT in the latter (Kellenberger, 1991; Sosinsky et al., 2008). However, depending on the virus and the stress the viral infection causes to the host cell, HPF/FS might not be suitable. It has been reported that stressed cells can freeze poorly with ice crystal formation (McDonald, 2007).",

            "text": "HPF increases the depth of vitrification in the sample but in a TEM only thin specimens can be visualized. After the discovery of vitrified water and the onset of cryo-EM (Br\u00fcggeller and Mayer, 1980; Dubochet and McDowall, 1981) the transition from thin films of vitrified small biological specimens to vitrified sections of bulk specimen was fast (Lepault et al., 1983; McDowall et al., 1983). To prepare a sample for cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), first the sample and the surrounding medium is vitrified. Next, it is sectioned in a cryo-microtome below the devitrification temperature of pure water and the sections are transferred to a grid. The sections are observed in the frozen state with a cryo-TEM using low dose conditions. For a long time, CEMOVIS was the only approach for cryo-TEM of bulk specimens. Compared to the thin film method of plunge frozen material, a frozen hydrated section has artifacts, mainly knife marks, compression, and crevasses of which the last two can be controlled (Al-Amoudi et al., 2005). CEMOVIS offers to visualize at high resolution a section of a bulk sample close to the native state. As for all cryo-EM approaches, also for CEMOVIS it is important to minimize the radiation damage of the beam during imaging. Though beam damage takes place also for resin embedded samples and results in shrinkage and mass loss (Luther et al., 1988). Nevertheless, this is mainly a concern for tomography of resin embedded material because the implications for 2D projection images of thin sections are negligible. By contrast, in cryo-EM of hydrated specimens beam damage is also visible on 2D projection images, which is impressively seen by the phenomenon of bubbling of organic material after a certain amount of electron dose (Dubochet et al., 1982). Bubbling is caused by H2 formation due to radiolysis of the biological specimen and the onset of it depends on the composition of the sample. On CEMOVIS sections it often starts on membranes or in protein rich regions. However, the structural damage starts already at low doses of electrons (Lepault et al., 1983). In our hands a dose between 5 and 8 e/\u00c52 per image allows at 120 kV to take images at several defocus values. For TEM tomography of CEMOVIS sections the cumulative dose should be kept below 80 e/\u00c52 (Hagen and Gr\u00fcnewald, 2008). However, for TEM tomography the use of CEMOVIS sections has remained a challenge, which is mainly due to the difficulties to attach the whole section flat on the grid and the pronounced formation of crevasses on sections thicker than 60 nm but it is not impossible (Bouchet-Marquis and Hoenger, 2011; Hagen et al., 2015). To avoid these problems for TEM tomography of vitreous sections, the preparation of cryo-lamella by FIB-SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) has been developed during the last years (Hagen et al., 2015; Hayles et al., 2010). Infected cells are plunge frozen on a TEM grid and are thinned in the FIB. With the absence of compression and especially crevasses, the sample is better suited for TEM tomography than a CEMOVIS section. However, care needs to be taken to thin the area of interest since a big part of the cell is removed by the FIB (Arnold et al., 2016). A current drawback of this approach is the cost of the equipment.",

            "text": "For all immunolabeling approaches a high affinity probe binds specifically to its target. The probe is either directly linked to an electron dense marker that can be directly visualized in the TEM or detected indirectly with a secondary probe, which carries an electron dense marker. Ferritin was used in the past to be later substituted by colloidal gold probes (Singer and Schick, 1961; Slot and Geuze, 1981). The majority of high affinity probes used today are antibodies against proteins, but also lectins can be used and in situ hybridization for RNA localization is possible (Gershon et al., 1994; Herpers et al., 2010). Different strategies exist to label the target of interest: they can be divided in general between pre- and post-embedding labeling. For pre-embedding labeling the whole cell is incubated with the affinity probe, followed by the electron dense marker. However, without permeabilization only epitopes exposed to the exterior of the cell are accessible (Gelderblom et al., 1987; Hinners et al., 1999). Permeabilization will provide access to intracellular epitopes, but will extract also cellular material and result in a compromised morphology. For post-embedding labeling, the sample is embedded in a way that preserves the structure of the epitope so that the affinity probe can bind to it when exposed on the surface of the section. This can be done when the samples are embedded in an acrylic or methacrylic resin, as LR White or Lowicryl (Armbruster et al., 1982; Ellinger and Pavelka, 1985). Methacrylic resins were developed by the group of Villiger-Kellenberger. They do not chemically react with the sample, and exist with a versatile range of polarities, which makes them compatible with immuno labeling (Carlemalm et al., 1982). An alternative for resin embedding is labeling on thawed cryosections, an approach which is also called the Tokuyasu technique, after its pioneer Kiyoteru Tokuyasu (M\u00f6bius and Posthuma, 2019). In this approach, the sample is arrested by a mild chemical fixation with aldehydes. Since chemical fixation is mandatory, in this approach it can be combined with the often necessary inactivation of viruses presenting a biosafety risk. Chemical fixation makes the plasma membrane of cells permeable for small solutes and the sample can be infiltrated with a sucrose solution (Penttila et al., 1974; Tokuyasu, 1973). The sucrose has a dual role: first, it works as a cryo-protectant for the subsequent freezing step, and second, it influences the elasticity of the sample to facilitate cryo-sectioning. After cryo-protection, the sample can be frozen in liquid nitrogen and becomes hard enough to be sectioned in a cryo-microtome. Frozen sections are thawed and transferred to a grid. Once attached to a grid they can be immunolabeled. The mild fixation of the sample combined with the absence of dehydration results in a good preservation of antigenicity for proteins. Together with the secondary probes conjugated to colloidal gold with different, defined size, this technique allows to study the distribution of two up to three different proteins in one labeling experiment (Slot and Geuze, 1981). But it is important to have the right controls for the specificity of the labeling (M\u00f6bius and Posthuma, 2019). After the labeling, the sections are embedded in a thin film of a mixture of uranylacetate and methylcellulose (Griffith et al., 1982). The uranylacetate works as a contrast agent, whereas the methylcellulose provides support to avoid too much shrinkage during the airdrying of the\u2014until this moment\u2014hydrated sections. With uranylacetate as the only contrasting agent the image of the sample from a Tokuyasu section gives a mixture of positive (e.g., nucleus) and negative contrast (e.g., membranes) with certain cellular structures (microtubules, ribosomes) unstained. The selective staining is more than compensated by the good preservation of antigens. The possibility of double or triple labeling makes it possible to study the distribution and sorting of viral proteins during their synthesis, and identify their pathways by cellular markers. This was elegantly demonstrated in the studies of the morphogenesis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in macrophages (Deneka et al., 2007). With the help of immunogold labeling on Tokuyasu cryosections, the authors demonstrated that the virus assembles in an intracellular membranous compartment that contains several tetraspanins and that is connected with the plasma membrane. Immunogold labeling contributed also to identify the cytoplasmic replication organelles of Vaccinia Virus (VV) that are endoplasmic reticulum-enclosed mini-nuclei (Tolonen et al., 2001) and to visualize the connections of nascent VV particles with ER/ERGIC cellular membranes that participate in the assembly of immature viruses (Moss, 2015; Salmons et al., 1997). Localization of viral proteins and cell markers helps to explore the origin of viral replication organelles. Moreover, assays of brome-uridine or brome-deoxiuridine incorporation for RNA or DNA viruses, respectively, in combination with immunogold detection on Tokuyasu cryosections, have been very useful to identify active replication organelles (Besse and Puvion-Dutilleul, 1994; Fontana et al., 2008; Tenorio et al., 2018). An example is shown in Fig. 6\n. Reovirus VIs are labeled with antibodies specific for ER markers, such as the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (Fig. 6A). These organelles support viral genome replication because in the presence of inhibitors of cellular RNA synthesis, they incorporate BrU, as confirmed with specific antibodies in immunogold labeling assays (Fig. 6B). For RNA viruses, antibodies specific for double-stranded RNA, an intermediate formed during RNA replication, are also used to label active VRCs. Anti-dsRNA antibodies work particularly well for positive-sense RNA viruses (Cotton et al., 2017; Fontana et al., 2007; Welsch et al., 2009) and some negative-sense RNA viruses (Fontana et al., 2008; Mateer et al., 2019). For bunyaviruses and flaviviruses it has been demonstrated that the anti-dsRNA signal co-localizes with that of BrU incorporation sites (Fontana et al., 2008; Westaway et al., 1999).",

In this projection, the spatial information within the volume of the thin section is lost. Over the last decades different 3D imaging techniques for biological samples have evolved. In general, for the different approaches there is an inverse relation between the resolution that can be obtained and the volume that can be imaged. TEM electron tomography (TEM-ET) started with the ground-breaking work of Hoppe et al. (1974). For ET, a series of 2D projection images of a sample is acquired over a large tilt series (+ 70\u00b0 to \u2212 70\u00b0) in small increments of 1\u00b0 (Frank, 1995) and the 3D model of the sample is computationally reconstructed. Due to the geometry of the sample holder, images at tilts above 70\u00b0 are impossible to acquire and a part of the sample will be lost in the reconstruction (missing wedge). For plastic sections, this wedge can be reduced and the resolution of the final tomogram increased by the acquisition of a double tilt series (Mastronarde, 1997). TEM-ET offers a good resolution but is limited by the thickness of the section that can be visualized (maximum 300\u2013500 nm), and the size of the area that can be analyzed. STEM (Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy) tomography allows the acquisition of tilt series from thicker sections up to 700 nm (Yakushevska et al., 2007).",

Therefore, the resolution in X and Y is down to few nanometers while in Z it is determined by the section thickness. Compared to FIB-SEM, serial sections are a non-destructive approach because the sections can be stored and re-evaluated. It also allows the reconstruction of large volumes and even whole cells can be studied. To avoid the difficulties of serial section tomography that come with varying compression and folds, Denk and Horstmann (2004) placed the sample into an SEM that contains a microtome. The image of the blockface is generated by the backscattered electrons of the SEM beam and after imaging, the microtome removes 30\u201350 nm of the sample surface to prepare a new blockface. Due to the imaging in the SEM, the resolution is lower compared to TEM serial section tomography, but larger volumes can be analyzed.",

The first study of a viral replication organelle visualized in 3D by electron tomography showed that flock house virus (FHV) in Drosophila cells assembles spherules with VRCs in mitochondria, spherules that connect with the cytosol through pores (Kopek et al., 2007). The 3D characterization of SARS CoV and DENV replication platforms had a significant impact in the field (Knoops et al., 2008; Welsch et al., 2009). Since then, many studies have demonstrated the power of these methods. Structures harboring the VRCs such as single-membrane spherules and double membrane vesicles have been studied in detail within the replication organelles of West Nile Virus (Gillespie et al., 2010), HCV (Romero-Brey et al., 2012), coxsackievirus B3 (Limpens et al., 2011), Bunyamwera virus (Fontana et al., 2008), Rubella virus (Fontana et al., 2010), Tombusvirus (Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro et al., 2017a), a cardiovirus (Melia et al., 2018) and the human reovirus (Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro et al., 2014a; Tenorio et al., 2018). The reovirus replication neoorganelle visualized in 3D with two different methods is shown in Fig. 7\n. With 3D reconstruction of serial sections large volumes that contain whole viral factories were generated (Fig. 7A). With ET of Tokuyasu cryosections smaller volumes with better definition of membranes and higher resolution were obtained (Fig. 7B).",

            "text": "Electron microscopists have been working for decades to localize proteins in cells in two and three dimensions. Together with the fundamental contribution of antibodies and immunogold labeling assays described in Section 7, a number of approaches have been reported to label proteins in cells using clonable tags. Most of them are based on the generation of an electron-dense precipitate of diaminobenzidine as a result of photoactivation of a fluorophore (GFP or Mini-SOG) or an enzymatic reaction (HRP or APEX2) (Connolly et al., 1994; Grabenbauer et al., 2005; Martell et al., 2012). An alternative approach that uses the small metal binding protein metallothionein (MT) as a clonable tag for electron microscopy was proposed by two scientists working at Brandeis University (Mercogliano and DeRosier, 2006, Mercogliano and DeRosier, 2007). The idea of MT-tagging was the basis of METTEM (Metal-Tagging TEM), a highly sensitive labeling technique that was validated in bacteria (Diestra et al., 2009a, Diestra et al., 2009b), yeast (Barajas et al., 2014; Morphew et al., 2015), and mammalian cells (Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro et al., 2017b; Risco et al., 2012; Sachse et al., 2018; Tenorio et al., 2018) and the only one used so far to label intracellular viral structures. In live cells incubated briefly with gold salts, proteins bearing MT will form ~ 1 nm-gold nano-clusters, readily detectable by electron microscopy (Risco et al., 2012). If the protein of interest is fused with MT and a fluorescent tag such as GFP, the same molecules will be visualized by light and electron microscopy (Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro et al., 2014b). Combining METTEM with immunogold allows double and multiple labeling approaches (Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro et al., 2014b). MT-tagging was used to detect one of the proteins of the Rubella virus VRC within replication organelles (ROs) (Risco et al., 2012). The study revealed that the viral polymerase molecules first localized in the plasma membrane to be later transported to lysosomes/ROs, where they aggregate into densely packed oligomeric arrays. Studies with the Tombusvirus Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus (TBSV) showed the distribution of the viral replicase molecules in modified ER membranes within the replication factory (Barajas et al., 2014) (Fig. 8\n). Molecules of the p33-MT-gold subunit of the viral polymerase labeled in live cells were visualized as ~ 1 nm nano-clusters in ultrathin sections (Fig. 8A). Immunogold labeling on sections confirmed the association of p33-MT-gold molecules with ER membranes labeled with anti-PDI antibodies and with active replication sites labeled with anti-dsRNA antibodies (Fig. 8A). 3D maps of the replicase molecules inside replication organelles were obtained by electron tomography (Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro et al., 2017a) (Fig. 8B). These volumes showed RO active domains labeled with anti-dsRNA antibodies together with RO domains devoid of labeling. A lateral view of the tomogram is shown in Fig. 8C. This volume shows why METTEM is a labeling method of high sensitivity: with antibodies only the epitopes exposed on the surface of the section are detected; however, with METTEM all protein molecules carrying an MT-gold-nanocluster inside the section are visualized in 2D and 3D. With METTEM it was discovered that influenza virus uses a modified ER to transport the vRNPs from the nucleus to the plasma membrane in a process that depends on Rab11 (Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro et al., 2017b). Early in infection, the reovirus non-structural protein \u03bcNS fused with MT was found in strangled ER cisternae and small vesicles near the nucleus. This result suggests that \u03bcNS triggers the massive ER fragmentation that generates replication organelles by direct binding to ER membranes (Tenorio et al., 2018).",

Before ET, sections were processed by immunogold labeling with an antibody against dsRNA and a colloidal gold conjugate (white). Molecules of p33-metallothionein-gold are represented in red and ER membranes in yellow. The active domain labeled with antibodies (black asterisk) within the replication organelle is surrounded by ER membranes, whereas the domain beyond the ER boundaries is not labeled. (C) Lateral view of the tomogram in B, showing the anti-dsRNA antibodies bound to their antigens on the section surface (white), whereas p33 molecules (red) were detected inside the section. Scale bar: 100 nm in mainfield in A; 50 nm in inset in A.",
