The lack of aerobiology studies results from several factors, including the need for specialized equipment to generate and monitor bioaerosols, the technical difficulty involved, inconsistency among reported techniques (Lore et al. 2011) and the considerable cost of conducting this research (Sherwood et al. 1988). Therefore, the most commonly described method of infecting mice with influenza virus is through the installation of fluid into the nasal passages (Lu et al. 1999; Govorkova et al. 2007; Gillim\u2010Ross et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2011).",

Their low cost, small size, relative susceptibility to the virus and ease of handling make mice a favourable platform for studying influenza virus infections. The mouse is currently considered the primary model for the evaluation of influenza antiviral agents because it is a predictive indicator of the efficacy of such treatments in humans (Sidwell and Smee 2004). The use of a well\u2010characterized mouse model is especially important in studying the infectious pathways of new pandemic (pdm) subtypes of influenza A. Indeed, the latest emergence of influenza has reignited interest in the use of mouse models (Beigel and Bray 2008).",

Animal models allow closer approximation to a human response (Schulman 1968; Lowen et al. 2006; Gustin et al. 2011), and therefore, it is important to continue to further develop these models (Fouchier et al. 2012; Kawaoka 2012).",

            "text": "Exposure to influenza virus often leads to a disease presenting as an acute and temporarily incapacitating infection of the upper respiratory tract that can be fatal. Influenza illness is often associated with occurrences of annual or near\u2010annual epidemics in temperate climate zones. Within the last 100 years, influenza pandemics have occurred four times [1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2) and 2009 (H1N1)] (Oxford 2000). Pandemics are infrequent but often severe events because of the emergence of novel, unpredictable strains of influenza A virus caused by recombination of genetic material from two or more circulating virus subtypes. This antigenic shift can often lead to a new virus subtype with the ability to jump from one species into another, potentially naive species (e.g. avian influenza), and cause a large proportion of influenza\u2010related deaths. A number of animal models have been studied to evaluate new vaccines and other approaches for preventing influenza\u2010related disease (Gubareva et al. 1998; Ng et al. 2010). Green and Kass (1964) conducted studies on the clearance of inhaled microbial aerosols from the murine respiratory tract. Schulman and Kilbourne (1963) studied mouse\u2010to\u2010mouse transmissibility of influenza virus.",

            "text": "A factor complicating viral research in animal models is that a virus may be present in a host without causing disease. This may be due to restrictions such as the absence of appropriate receptors on certain cell types (e.g. tissue tropism) and the lack of intracellular processes required to generate infectious progeny viruses or induce cytolytic effects. Differences in viral receptors have been documented for respiratory epithelial cells based on location in either the pharynx or peripheral lung (van Riel et al. 2007, 2010). In addition, either the organism or host cell may mount an immune response or generate intracellular molecules that disrupt the viral effects. Therefore, differences may appear at either the cellular or tissue level or among susceptible hosts depending upon the method of infection, especially in regard to aerosol exposures (Phalen et al. 2008). This study examined these parameters related to efficient (near threshold) infection versus overwhelming infection of mice by exposure to aerosolized influenza virus.",

The aerosol, which acquires surface charges during atomization, passes through a 9\u00b75\u2010inch (23\u2010cm) diffusion drier and then through a 2\u2010mCi 85Kr charge neutralizer (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA) to restore the \u2018normal\u2019 Boltzmann equilibrium charge distribution.

Our preferred explanation is that some of the mice were able to process and clear virus, while in others, it caused clinical infection and disease. Additionally, the hardiness of immune response to influenza varies among the mice, resulting in different levels of susceptibility. For example, in Table 3 at the lowest exposure time, one of the three mice was positive for infection, whereas in the lowest dose experiment (Table 4), one mouse was positive following only 6 min of exposure.",

Sidorenko and Reichl (2004) developed a mathematical model describing the complete life cycle of influenza A in animal cells. This model, based on the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 virions per cell, suggests that influenza replicates within 5 h postinfection and produces up to 8000 progeny virions before cell death occurs.

Therefore, we utilized qRT\u2010PCR in comparison with TCID50 to minimize the variability.

As the gold standard (Schrauwen et al. 2011) for determining the MOI has been TCID50 and quantification of virus in mice exposed to influenza aerosols by qRT\u2010PCR has not been previously reported, additional confirmatory studies were needed. We chose seven days as the terminal point for our study based on symptomatology in humans where virus production peaks approximately 48 h postinfection, and few virus particles are shed after day 6 (Taubenberger and Morens 2008). Our results showed the delivered aerosol MID50 to be at least 12 TCID50 as determined by qRT\u2010PCR Ct value and significantly <40 TCID50 as determined by obvious clinical response. However, the sample size must be expanded in the future to achieve greater resolution and statistical significance. In addition, future studies will utilize the influenza virus A (H1N1) pdm strain to determine variation in MID50 between the two strains.",

Various approaches have been proposed to increase the effectiveness of respiratory filtering media including the addition of bioactive media. Although materials such as silver nanoparticles (Lala et al. 2007), copper oxide (Borkow et al. 2010), iodinated compounds (Heimbuch and Wander 2006) and others (Cecchini et al. 2004) have shown biocidal potential, only the iodine vector has been proposed (Lee et al. 2009) to operate by a noncontact mechanism. Additional studies will focus on evaluating such new technologies and, after replacement of the filter holder with a larger enclosure able to collect aerosols behind a filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) worn by an articulated headform, on quantifying the effect on protectivity of seal leakage and on optimizing the particle removal efficiency of FFRs and other RPE to maximize net protectivity.",
