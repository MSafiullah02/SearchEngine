It is in this vein that Prescott defines border and boundary (Prescott 1965; Neuman 2001). He defines \u2018 boundary\u2019 as a physical line between States and \u2018border\u2019 as \u201cadjacent areas which line the boundaries\u201d (Prescott 1965). Furthermore, \u201ca borderland is a transition zone within which a boundary lies\u201d (Prescott 1965). That these are contested seems a requisite admission, and applies not only on land but also at sea.2 Whether territorially or (increasingly also) aquatically, it is States that remain sovereign, responsible for the security of their bounded borders and for that of the citizens within those (Kamel 2009, 160). Indeed, the very concept\u2014whereto the (r)evolutions of security into human security have led\u2014of Statehood and sovereignty has, in these modern times, culminated in a State that defines \u201citself by its borders, whose complexity is a function of the State having become more complicated and organized\u201d (Bashford 2006, 21). Yet control remains an integral function of borders.",

Currently, for example, in response to \u201cdemands of Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats are calling for their own autonomous entity\u201d (Skrpec 2017). If Croatia\u2019s own internal politics \u201conce again become polarized, hard-line conservatives could revive Croatia\u2019s support for Bosnian Croats\u2014who can legally vote in Croatia\u2019s elections and tend to support the nationalists\u201d (Skrpec 2017). So far in 2017, the neighboring government in Croatia, led by Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, has doggedly stuck to a course of noninterference. This appears to be functioning as a brake on further Serbian efforts to secede. However, if the peace fractures, such voting patterns could upend the fragile compromises that have kept war at bay in the Balkans since 1995. Similar voting patterns likely fuel some of the instability plaguing Kenya\u2019s electoral rivalries (as per elections in 2008, 2017). This effect is likely to emerge again as the UK\u2019s BREXIT negotiations impact the migration status of Irish workers on both sides of the Ireland/Northern Ireland border.",

The German government denied numerous Turkish politicians opportunities to do so. In the process, however, two additional elements of human and State security associated with territorial and political borders were exposed. These are (1) the State security exposure brought about by external State interference vis-\u00e0-vis its claim on its nonresident citizens, and in association, (2) the human security vulnerability wrought from the lack of a complete citizen-State relationship. With regard to the latter, if nonresident citizens are only able to voice their demands toward the State of their citizenship, their political and human position becomes precarious: possibly seen as a threat to the State of their residence, and singled out by the State of their citizenship for their (political) participation and acquiescence. The fact that such citizens are not resident reduces their personal sense of responsibility for any (untoward) consequences, though their expression of citizenship impacts themselves and others around them.",

While the former may register to work and receive a permit, and eventually a South Africa identification number also enabling access to the health-care system, to do so, they are required to renew this on a regular basis. In early 2017, the South African government changed the length of such a permit from six to one month. That means that a worker, a teacher for instance, must take at least a day of leave every month, venture into the overburdened Department of Home Affairs, and hope for a clerk on duty who will apply the stamp to extend the permit. Very often, one day in line is inadequate.3 Whether or not an employee requiring such onerous and unpredictable paperwork is retained becomes an open question with myriad human security consequences: for instance, for pupils in school and for any family members dependent upon the employment status of the migrant worker for their own residency permits. As a case in point, the children of such a migrant worker depend, and can depend, upon his/her residency and employment status for their own residency permits and access to education\u2014up onto a point. The challenge Busi4 and other children of migrants interviewed in South Africa in April 2017 were contemplating is twofold: despite having been born in South Africa, without either (1) declaring themselves refugees and applying for South African citizenship, or (2) returning to Zimbabwe, where they can claim citizenship, they are ineligible to register for the matriculation (matric) examinations that mark the end of their secondary schooling.5 It goes without saying that without the matric exam their education remains officially incomplete, making it impossible for them to apply for vocational school or tertiary education anywhere in the world. With that, their human\u2014social and economic\u2014security is in doubt; so, too, is the contribution that would be slated to make to the societies, on either side of the border, if their migration status and their claim to citizenship and human security provisions and protections were honored.",

The estimated 800,000 American-raised \u2018Dreamer\u2019 children were not born on US territory, and therefore not automatically granted US citizenship. Ostensibly, the termination of DACA is a political machination to propel the US Congress to reform the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, known as the Dream Act. The Dream Act, if passed, would grant residency and a path to citizenship to young immigrants (Jordan 2017). However, given the current State of US governance, it seems highly unlikely that such an exception\u2014which has eluded Congress for 16 years\u2014would pass. In the interim, the DACA has allowed those accepted into the program to apply and qualify for driver\u2019s licenses, in-State tuition at public colleges and universities, and work permits. They contribute much more to the US social and economic fabric than would their deportation: calculations vary, but hover in the range of $60 billion just to deport \u2018Dreamers,\u2019 and between $280 billion (Brannon and Albright 2017) and $460.3 billion (Center for American Progress and FWD.us 2017), with an additional drop of $24.4 billion projected for social welfare programs such as Medicare and Social Security, to the US economy as a whole. These losses directly impact the human security of all directly and indirectly affected by the ensuing loss of social protections, health care, and societal cohesion. The limbo such young people become caught in, in South Africa or the US, is an affront to their human security rights and a potential source of instability\u2014as unemployment and disaffection rise\u2014for State security on both sides of the implicated borders.",

With particular regard to migrants, it advocates that \u201cforeign-born persons intending to stay in the country (other than for a stated short period of time, for example not more than three months), who are not exempt from any residential permit requirement, have a duty to undergo medical examination for tuberculosis\u201d (Bashford 2006, 170). Indeed, TB, as an airborne disease, presents a particular threat, both historically and currently. Its threat is exacerbated by the rise in drug-resistant TB, which is putting a strain on health systems, especially in hard-hit regions such as the Eastern Cape in South Africa. In an attempt to address the particular risk of TB,\n(UK) Government proposed to screen 250,000 visa applicants for tuberculosis \u2018on high risk routes\u2019 and require those diagnosed to seek treatment before being allowed to travel to the UK.57 Although such a policy might be appealing because of the potential to shift cost and responsibility (in line with the general move to contain potential immigrants and asylum seekers in their regions and countries of origin and buffer zones around the EU), and in terms of the political messages it sends (\u2018our borders are secure, we are keeping disease at bay\u2019), it is unlikely to be effective, and the diversion of resources will have opportunity costs that may undermine effective public health policy in the UK and poor countries. By defending the country from disease in this way, UK public health may in fact become less secure. (Bashford 2006, 172)This dual dependency\u2014treatment tied to entry tied to treatment\u2014showcases the inextricable links between migration and borders and health. While screening need not be the culprit cutting migrants off against treatment per se, it needs to be reimagined beyond borders. Merely barring migrants in need of treatment raises the risk of infection for migratory and sedentary populations. Enabling treatment, and prevention, at and across borders, presents in theory, if not always in practice (see following chapter)\u2014yet\u2014an opportunity to protect and provide health security for both populations.",

At both the external and along the internal borders of the EU, migrants from \u201cregions with high rates of diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS are likely to fall within the broader exclusionary approach to migration and borders being implemented through the EU itself\u201d (Bashford 2006, 166). In South Africa, the use of biotechnology to screen for previous trial participants in, among others, HIV and AIDS research studies can also be availed for screening (il)legal migrants.

Yet, ultimately, such \u201can excessive focus on border control will ultimately undermine protection against global infectious chronic disease\u201d (Kamel 2009, 160). This is because infectious diseases will spread regardless of territorially bounded border controls. No border is airtight\u2014not capable of sealing itself off against inward or outward migrants; no State is so self-sufficient as to be able to desist from the brain or financial gain contained in human or monetary capital, each movement of which has the potential to import\u2014or export\u2014disease. \u201cWith as many as 1.6 billion people predicted to travel abroad each year by 2020, a fast-moving new lethal disease, a catastrophic flu epidemic, or a drug-resistant \u2018superbug\u2019 could abruptly increase the level of risk\u201d (Kassalow 2001; and Kassalow in Coker and Ingram 2006, 161).

Human beings around the world are increasingly demanding the same rights\u2014for instance in health. This means that in order to attract the financial and human capital necessary to guarantee the (economic) conditions for human rights and development, States are more co-dependent than ever. This is also the case because \u201cthe\nis an enduring feature of the global political structure, and remains the primary authority for the negotiation of global rules\u201d (Ottersen et al. 2014).

Despite whatever action or intervention NSAs or the \u2018 international community\u2019 might take on behalf of, with or without the consent of the sovereign State, for whatever period of time, this is not subject to the same ultimate guarantee. Thus if that \u2018international community\u2019 deigns to continue its intervention, there is little if any recourse for the State to take to reinstate a guarantee; if such intervention has undermined State provision all the worse for the State, precisely as this ultimate guarantee of sovereign rights remains with the State.",

Citizenship, and its claims, would need effectively to be made global. This means that States would have to embrace the rights of each of their residents as constituents and would have to answer for the long-term provision of rights whose delivery they initiate beyond their borders. Furthermore, the \u2018international community,\u2019 of States, but also of NSAs, would have to be able to and be made answerable for global rights provisions as \u2018guaranteed\u2019 in the UNDR. That this is \u2018impractical\u2019 is clear\u2014States\u2019 rights continue to trump those of (global) citizens, so say nothing about the Stateless. However, the theory unequivocally points in this direction, as only such global citizenship claims, directed at State and non-State actors alike, will meet the human rights demands prescriptively guaranteed regardless of State or non-State affiliation and action. The consequence would be citizenship claims that are both local\u2014in residence\u2014and global; States would also be called to task not only for their action, but also for their inaction, and would be joined by NSAs currently operating outside of any accountability framework. The short-term political and economic costs appear high; the long-term benefits for rights provision are incalculable.",
