This \"crisis,\" with the daunting prospect that one of the most beneficial discoveries and developments in the history of mankind could become extinct within a mere few human generations, has understandably also prompted a wide range of recommendations, guidelines, and policies with the intent of preserving and protracting the utility of our current antibacterial armamentarium.

A greater understanding of the collective impact of policies on Pharma's ability and willingness to conduct sustainable research and development (R&D) of antibacterials is needed along with a cooperative partnership approach. There is a need for governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), policy-makers, regulators, and infectious disease experts to collaborate with Pharma to establish ways to maximize the chance of bringing new antibacterials into clinical use and sustain their utility. Unfortunately, individual Pharma companies continue to exit from antibacterial discovery and development and the pool of major companies is likely to soon be occupied by a handful or less, severely restricting the ability of Pharma to meet the medical needs of infectious diseases, particularly those which require flexibility and responsiveness, such as epidemics and those arising from bioterrorism. Once R&D efforts are terminated it will require substantial new investment, both in monetary and intellectual terms, as well as time to re-initiate effective programmes. Without continued, sustainable, and successful antibacterial R&D, we will certainly be facing the prospect of \"antibacterial extinction.\"",

White have evolved from some 20 to 30 companies with antibacterial R&D heritages. Some are the result of none or few amalgamations while others are many-fold. Of the top 12 companies, less than half are believed to be currently active in antibacterial R&D. Within the remaining companies the discovery effort has been directed towards either defined niche disease areas, or large \"blockbuster\" commercial areas, with a consequent reduction in diversity across the industry. Individual specializations within Pharma, such as was the case when companies almost exclusively worked on penicillins (Beecham Research Laboratories), cephalosporins (Glaxo), or quinolones (Bayer AG), for example, are becoming less as the companies look to satisfy commercially attractive target product profiles from whichever molecular classes that are available through their R&D efforts or in-licensing. The emphasis on development of line extensions of existing molecules has also increased as a means to improve patient benefits such as convenience and efficacy and importantly for Pharma, to maintain development and commercial activity to offset patent loss and bridge the gap to the introduction of new agents. Critically, of the companies which have exited or severely reduced their antibacterial R&D (e.g., Aventis, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly & Co, Roche-Chugai, and Wyeth Research) (IDSA, 2003) , these decisions have been taken relatively recently at a time when the need for new effective antibacterials is arguably greater, but also at a time when policies and regulations for the development and use of antibacterials have proliferated.",

Infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years worldwide. Antibacterials are key tools in treating many globally important infectious diseases, including meningitis, pneumonia, diarrhoeal illness, skin and bone infections, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhoea, syphilis, and chlamydia), HIV/AIDS-related bacterial infection, and diseases that may be spread as a result of bioterrorist acts. Withdrawal from antibacterial research will have a major impact on global health. A letter to the journal of the American Society for Microbiology (Appelbaum, 2003) states that, \"A crisis has developed and we are doing nothing about it,\" highlighting that Pharma companies are reducing or closing their antibacterial research and that pipelines are, \"practically empty.\" Appelbaum suggests that, unlike drugs for long-term treatments, there is a lack of funding for research into antibacterials, one of the reasons for this being the overly stringent approval criteria imposed by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA), making it practically impossible or prohibitively expensive to bring new antibacterials to market (Appelbaum, 2003) .",

IDSA reported that of 89 new medicines reaching the US market in 2002 none was an antibacterial, with only 7 new antibacterials being approved since 1998 (IDSA, 2003) . A review of company reports for the 11 major Pharma companies listed only 4 new antibacterials in the drug pipeline out of 290 agents listed (1.38%) (IDSA, 2003) and that on average the time to develop new antibacterials was 7-10 years from discovery to first approval. Although Pharma has continued to explore ways to increase efficiencies and decrease development times, these have largely remained stable due to the increased numbers of patients required for new drug applications (NDAs), as well as increased complexity and costs in meeting regulatory approval requirements (Kaitin and DiMasi, 2000) . An important consideration for Pharma companies involved in R&D and commercialization of therapies for a range of disease areas, is that other therapeutic areas are increasingly more profitable than antibacterials. Today, there are fewer large companies specializing in antibacterials as a main R&D area. Investment decisions are made across and between therapeutic areas and Pharma has an obligation to maintain shareholder value and commercial viability or else no new drugs would become available in any therapy area.",

This, accompanied by parallel activities to monitor and understand resistance (such as its consequences and relationship to antibiotic use), improve infection control, and development of new agents (antibacterials and vaccines) and therapeutic approaches, is hoped to provide a sustainable solution in combating bacterial infection. Carbon et al. (2002) state that these recommendations rightly focus on controlling resistance in the community through surveillance of resistance and usage, and education of prescribers and the public in judicious antibiotic use. Nevertheless, the authors point to the need for more research to fill substantial knowledge gaps, notably the reversibility or containment of resistance with the optimization of antibiotic usage has yet to be definitely established Davey et al., 2003) . It is suggested by Carbon et al. (2002) that for now, antimicrobial management programmes should focus on ensuring the most appropriate use of antimicrobials rather than simply on limiting choices. Interventions must also be audited for effectiveness/cost . It is also suggested that the programmes in the recommendations can not succeed if they do not imply the active contribution of health professionals, politicians, consumers, and Pharma, and that the creation of optimal conditions for this type of cooperation is of critical importance Chahwakilian, 2000) . The key role of Pharma in these strategies is to deliver new antibacterials, although the cumulative impact of the parallel recommendations may present significant barriers to achieving this aim ( Figure 1 ).",

Global or regional, longitudinal surveillance studies are extremely expensive and resource intensive. Individual Pharma companies have initiated and solely sponsored studies to support the development and marketing of new agents (Bax et al., 2001; Felmingham et al., 2002; Hunter and Reeves, 2002) . This creates a situation where at a particular time a number of Pharma companies may compete for collecting centres for key isolates and be funding a number of laboratories to screen similar isolates and agents while at other times or for other pathogens or agents, there may be little Pharma support, or data available from any source. Surveillance funded by government, societies, or other non-Pharma sources may not meet Pharma's specific needs. Conversely, Pharma's studies may not meet broader needs (Bax et al., 2001; Lewis, 2002) , or be perceived as \"distorted\" source of data because they are funded by Pharma (Lewis, 2002) . Pharma support for large single-sponsored surveillance studies is dependent on successful product registrations and marketing. Similarly, Pharma support for broad regional and national studies, of value to strategists and policy-makers in these areas will become limited in an environment of reduced investment and commercial success. Collaborative surveillance between and within Pharma and academia or regulators may become increasingly necessary but is difficult to implement in terms of mutually acceptable objectives, scope, methods, timelines, funding agreement, management, and publication/presentation rights. Bax et al. (2001) stated that consortium funding will be necessary for large schemes to be successful, and that there is no \"ideal\" surveillance system.",

There is a recognition that while prescribing guidelines and other prescribing support systems should help control bacterial resistance in the community, their actual effect on resistance patterns is largely unknown (Finch and Low, 2002) and the reversibility or containment of resistance with the optimization of antibiotic usage has yet to be definitely established Davey et al., 2003) . Davey et al. (2003) described the control of antibiotic prescribing as a crucial part of any strategy to limit the development of resistance as advocated by the UK House of Lords recommendations and the Copenhagen recommendations . These authors recognized the difficulty in proving that antibiotic policies help to resolve a problem of resistance that has already developed and also recognized the greater difficulty in proving that policies prevent the development of resistance. Most policies (and guidelines) are concerned with which antibiotic is prescribed and Davey et al. (2003) state that it is more likely that development of resistance will be contained by policies which also try to limit unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics (i.e., prescribing for non-bacterial or self-limiting illness).",

There are examples where control of antibiotic use has reduced the incidence of outbreak and resistant organisms in hospitals and similar examples where reduction of prescribing in the community has led to a degree of control of resistance. There are a number of confounding factors which make it difficult to attribute cause and effect entirely to reduction in antibiotic prescribing (Davey et al., 2003; Gould, 1999) . Mathematical modelling seeks to take these factors into account and, while also casting doubts on whether reduction alone will prevent or reduce resistance (Austin et al., 1999; Gould, 1999) , may help with future understanding of measures which contribute to or reduce antibacterial resistance, and as such should be encouraged. Use of this approach to define policies has been limited (if used at all) (Davey et al., 2003) . Nevertheless, policy decisions should be supported by evidence, and not just by concerns about future development of resistance or the desire to reduce costs (Davey et al., 2003) .",

Use of antibacterials outside of this scenario is unnecessary, contributes to overuse and is an avoidable risk factor in the development of resistance (Ball et al., 2002; Davey et al., 2003) . However, when use of antibacterials is warranted (necessary) to treat bacterial infection, such use may also be inappropriate or suboptimal in terms of choice of antibacterial, dose, or duration. For example, Schlemmer (2001) concluded that antibiotic misuse does have an impact on promoting antibiotic resistance, and that antibacterial choice, dosage, dosing regimen, or duration of therapy must also, therefore, be considered. Carbon et al. (2002) suggested that, for now, antimicrobial management programmes should focus on ensuring the most appropriate use of antimicrobials rather than simply on limiting use or choices. A Consensus Group (Ball et al., 2002) has recently identified principles for appropriate prescribing of antibacterials in lower respiratory tract infection with which to underlay prescribing and guideline formulation.

The definition and implementation of appropriate prescribing based on evidence-based optimization of quality antibacterial use (right drug/dose/duration based on PD indices and local resistance patterns), rather than reduction in quantity alone may contribute towards the aim of slowing or preventing the emergence of antibacterial resistance, and also offer associated cost and efficiency benefits. Importantly, this approach may also maintain an environment that supports the use of new effective antibacterials and a commercial rationale for investment and development by Pharma.

In the case of antibacterials, the situation is compounded by increasingly demanding regulatory policies affecting the activities required to secure product registration, the product label and clinical use (Shlaes and Ryan, 2003 ). The extent and success of antibacterial research has declined (IDSA, 2003) and is partly a reflection of its relatively low commercial attractiveness compared to other therapeutic areas. The relative return on investment (ROI) or net present value (NPV) of antibacterials is a reflection of the market size and chance of success in capturing a commercially acceptable part of that market. This important \"market share\" will be a reflection of the properties and utility of the agents along with the success of marketing activities. Differentiation of comparative benefits, such as efficacy against resistant organisms, broader spectrum of pathogens for a given indication, superior efficacy over commonly used treatments, improved dosage regimens and compliance, or better safety characteristics are important features in marketing an antibacterial and in the acceptance and uptake by policy-makers and in the demonstration of cost-benefits to formularies. Policies or guidelines which decrease the ability of Pharma to demonstrate these benefits, reduce the chance of gaining differentiated label indications (such as the inclusion of resistant organisms), or restrict usage to limited indications (such as only to resistant organisms) will negatively impact NPVs and ROIs for new agents. Development of an antibacterial agent for restricted use only may not be a commercially attractive proposition for Pharma companies with interests in other therapeutic areas.",

Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, represented the first novel compound class introduced to the market in more than 25 years (Diekema and Jones, 2000) . Traditional chemical modification to produce new members of existing classes has resulted in significant improvements in \u2424-lactams, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones (e.g., Rasmussen and Projan, 2003) , but has been a relatively slow and labourintensive process with limited additional success in recent years. A team of bench chemists in the 1970s might produce up to 30 novel compounds each per annum for biological screening against a panel of target organisms, resulting in a total, perhaps of hundreds of compounds being screened. For example, methicillin, discovered in 1960 had a Beecham Research number of BRL 1241, and was followed by many valuable semisynthetic penicillins over the next decade, notably ampicillin (in 1961 (in ), carbenicillin (1967 (in ), and amoxicillin, designated BRL 2333 (in (1972 , indicating the extent of synthesis and screening of this highly successful semisynthetic range of compounds, at approximately 100 per year. Unfortunately, this approach of chemical modification based on knowledge of structure-activity relationships combined with improvements in throughputs of screening has failed to increase the number and diversity of antibacterials in recent times. Mills (2003) describes genomics-related technologies as they are currently applied to the discovery of small molecule antibacterial therapies. With respect to microbial genomics, the DNA sequence of Haemophilus influenzae was published in 1995 (the first free-living whole-organism sequence), followed by Mycoplasma genitalium and many other sequenced complete bacterial genomes, of which 79 are publicly available, including those of more than 40 human pathogens.",

Label indications are a key point to control antibiotic use (Schlemmer, 2001) and any information given to the prescriber that is able to help select for proper indications is potentially an important tool for good antimicrobial practice (Schlemmer, 2001) . However, Schlemmer (2001) also states that there is a critical need for trials to select for those patient populations who really need antibiotics, or to look for new endpoints able to differentiate between drugs, rather than only demonstrating equivalence. This approach may ensure that clinical evidence supports the claim for beneficial activity against a particular organism in a particular indication, or population, but inevitably will restrict the breadth of label.",

However, the use of such data has yet to be fully accepted and adopted by the FDA as a surrogate for clinical efficacy and breakpoint determination. PK/PD data are of particular interest when trying to define the best dosage and dosing regimens for new compounds. As the bacteriological endpoint correctly defines the outcome in an infectious process it would serve to assess the PK/PD relationship of a drug (Schlemmer, 2001) . Using PK/PD data to predict bacterial eradication or clinical outcome should be considered as the only way to select for optimal therapeutic regimens regarding antibiotic choice and dosing regimen as well as determining the optimal therapy duration (Ball et al., 2002; Schlemmer, 2001) .

Phase III clinical trials are designed primarily to meet the requirements of the regulators. However, these traditional comparative noninferiority trials fail to provide important evidence of potential benefits over existing therapies. With clinical success for antibacterials in the 85% or more level, demonstrations of superiority require vast patient populations. Pharma rely on other data to indicate superiority and benefit, ranging from potency (minimum inhibitory concentrations, etc.), per cent susceptibility based on breakpoint, in vitro and in vivo models, PK/PD, and defined clinical studies to demonstrate bacteriological and health-outcome benefits. Much of the clinical work undertaken to secure regulatory approval fails to best demonstrate the role and clinical benefits of new agents (Bax et al., 1999) and yet is often used as the evidence base for reimbursement, guidelines, and policies. There has also been a proposal to update and harmonize antibacterial product labels between European countries, particularly for \"old\" antibiotics and their datasheets (summary of product characteristics) at the time of generic introductions because lack of relevant product information promotes inappropriate use (European Conference on Antibiotic Use in Europe, 15-17 November, 2001; Schlemmer, 2001) .

There is a danger that the wide range of policies which have been introduced under the auspices of \"combating resistance\" will themselves hamper Pharma's ability to deliver a key strategy, if not the most important weapon in the battle against bacterial infection and resistance, the introduction of novel antibacterials. Policies and improvements in the quality of antibacterial prescribing have an important role to play, as do diagnostics, vaccines, infection control, and other interventions. Pharma is clearly an important partner along with government, NGOs, regulators, infectious diseases experts, practioners, and patients in the battle against bacterial infection. The \"conflicts of interest between the prescriber, the regulator, and the profit maker\" was the subject of a supplement to Clinical Microbiology and Infection. The editor (Gould, 2001a) , recognized that the calls for restrained use of antibacterials to combat and control resistance counters the natural instincts of doctors to do the best for their patients and of Pharma, which of necessity, needs to profit to exist and continue.",

There needs to be a distinction between companies which are solely suppliers of generic products and those who have the objective, dedication, and expertise to discover and introduce new antibacterials. These are undoubtedly profit makers, being subject to commercial and shareholder expectations, but perhaps should be considered foremost as \"providers\" with respect to new antibacterial solutions. Gould describes an international partnership of medical societies and industry, in association with regulators as a model for the future in the battle against antibacterial resistance (Gould, 2001b) . Schlemmer (2001) highlighted that while antibacterial policies were the keystone in promotion of good antimicrobial practice, more accurate and relevant information on antibiotics is urgently needed and that it is the responsibility of Pharma and regulators to move together towards an improvement in antibiotic evaluation. The objective would be to give prescribers more critical product information and to help the experts create better guidelines.",

In the United States a multiagency task force of FDA, CDC and the National Institute of Health (NIH) issued a document entitled Public Health Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance in 2001 with a priority to create an interagency antimicrobial resistance product development working group coordinated by the FDA, US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and CDC (Shlaes and Ryan, 2003) . A second priority was to, \"Investigate and act upon potential approaches for stimulating and speeding the entire antimicrobial resistance product development process, from drug discovery through licensing,\" including exploring the economics of the situation and incentives. While Monnet and Sorensen (2001) argue that much investment from Pharma is into marketing and not R&D and that the so-called \"R&D Scare Card\" is not justified, it is clear that Pharma companies are increasingly taking the commercial decision not to invest in R&D for antibacterials, but in other areas. According to Shlaes and Ryan, incentives for increasing Pharma R&D into priority infectious diseases include the need for more information on the market and disease areas (based on market identification, disease-specific bioinformatic systems, development of surrogate endpoints), more predictability (based on market assessment, international regulatory harmonization, and reinforcement of intellectual property rights), and more cost-risk sharing (market creation, patent extension, orphan drug legislation) (Shlaes and Ryan, 2003) .",

Policies that relate to development activities and labelling have the potential to increase development costs, restrict use, and limit the ability to differentiate benefits. Collectively policies are negatively impacting big Pharma's willingness to continue investment in this field. The combined and cumulative effects of the various policy items related to surveillance, use, clinical trial guidelines, product labelling, and promotion require a broad, collaborative, and global view of the impact on Pharma R&D. Collaboration is required to identify agreed and mutually acceptable ways to streamline development, implement appropriate prescribing, demonstrate and promote product benefits, and maintain financial incentives. Antibacterial discovery, development, and use are related within a dynamic environment that includes bacteria, their resistances, and policies. As with any dynamic environment, change will alter the balance (Figure 3 ). Policies are contributing to a change and a negative impact on the potential and willingness of Pharma to develop new antibacterials. While change may require adaptation for survival and success, careful consideration and collaboration is needed by all parties to help to ensure that insurmountable hurdles are not created leading to the inability of Pharma to survive and succeed in antibacterial R&D. Failure of Pharma to deliver new antibacterials would lead to \"antibacterial extinction.\"",
