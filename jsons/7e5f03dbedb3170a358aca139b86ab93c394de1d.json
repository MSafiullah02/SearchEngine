This increase has contributed significantly to the overutilization of raw materials and to an almost uncontrolled pollution of air, land, and water resources. Alarmed by these problems, many governments have attempted to control the sources of chemical and microbial pollutants by laws and regulations. One of the control measures taken by the Congress of the United States was the Water Pollution Control Act of 1965, to which a number of amendments were passed in 1972. This act specified that by July 1, 1983, all disposal wastes must be confined so as not to cause water or other environmental pollution. In 1977 the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency indicated in a policy statement that attention should be given to waste treatment processes that renovate and reuse water as well as those that recycle organic matter and nutrients in a more efficient manner.",

Bacterial pathogens were detected in the irrigation water and on the crops irrigated by wastewater from a primary sewage treatment plant (South Platte River Basin, 1966) . In many parts of the world sewage wastes are used in crop production. Mexico and India have areas in which food and fodder crops are intensively irrigated with raw sewage wastes from large cities. Storage before use on these agricultural lands is the only treatment process used. In some countries large quantities of human and animal wastes defecated on the ground are washed into agricultural fields during periods of heavy rain. Such practices expose the farmers and consumers of such crops to a variety of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and parasitic animals. Even if such foods are cooked, the potential for cross contamination is high.",

The middle-sized and larger municipalities will have an increased sludge disposal problem but effluents, because of the high fluid volumes, will still be disposed in a water carriage system.

Other sewage treatment processes vary in their efficiency from 0% to 99% with little consistency in operations. In addition, mechanical failures and heavy storm water influxes result in the bypass of raw sewage for varying periods of time. The greatest problem affecting plant operation efficiency is the failure of municipalities and industry to pay sufficiently high wages to encourage qualified people to manage the complex biological, chemical, and engineering aspects of a well-operated treatment plant. The huge expenditures in construction grant activity will be of little use without capable people to operate and supervise closely every phase of the sewage tratment process.",

Plastic granules have replaced stones in some trickling filter beds, oxygen has been substituted for air in many secondary processes and a number of physical-chemical treatment processes have been investigated. Batch processes, recycling, and other innovative changes in existing treatment treatment methodology are being investigated (Process development, 1979) . Therefore, any disposal systems projected for use in the United States should be of high caliber. Wastes from efficient sewage treatment plants, it has been argued, should not be compared to raw sewage. The argument may be valid quantitatively but not qualitatively. Biologically and chemically, there may be little qualitative difference. The problem may be one of reduced magnitude, but it is not obviated.",

Because such organisms may persist longer than the time required for growth and distribution of the crops, consumption of such foods could be a health hazard. Compounding this problem are the known deficiencies in plant operation, mechanical breakdowns, lack of microbiological monitoring, limited or absent germicidal treatment, and the lack of nationwide regulations and policies governing the application of sewage wastes to land (Larkin et al., 1978) .",

This observation led to the isolation of potable water from waste discharge areas. As this civilization declined, its environmental controls against disease were forgotten and such controls were not resurrected even in more enlightened countries until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. During the preceding centuries, bubonic plague, typhus, smallpox, cholera, typhoid, malaria, and uncontrolled infant and juvenile mortality ravaged the human population. Even today, many of these diseases, along with numerous other parasitic, bacterial, and viral infections, plague the Asiatic, African, and South American continents. The knowledge required to control most of these dis-ea6es is available, but because of economics and higher priority activities, millions of people are exposed to a daily onslaught of microbial and chemical contaminants.",

The United States has been fortunate in having available the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Great Lakes, and numerous large and small rivers and streams in which to dump its wastes. In addition, because of relatively limited populations, large land areas are available for waste disposal in some parts of the country. Whether the existence of these areas will effectively reduce water pollution problems in the future without these areas becoming new zones of contamination will depend on the ability of managers of municipal and industrial wastes treatment processes to control the biological and chemical contaminants present in the wastes disposed on the land.",
