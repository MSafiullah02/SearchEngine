Demonstration of causal relationships have not been successful, but, of these agents, FCV seems to have the most consistent evidence of being associated with FCGS. 9, 12, [18] [19] [20] [29] [30] [31] A recent study found the incidence of FCV to be significantly higher in cats with FCGS (60%) compared with control cats (24%) as well as cats with feline resorptive lesions (23%). 32 Regardless, well-known risk factors for these viruses include free-roaming behavior and living in multicat environments such as shelters, shared households, and breeding catteries.

Association between outdoor access and FCGS was lacking, suggesting that factors relating to multicat environments may be necessary in addition to an infectious cause to trigger the development of FCGS.

Interestingly, none of the cats showed clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. In addition, microscopic evidence of inflammation and metaplasia was found on histopathologic evaluation of grossly normal-appearing tissues. Endoscopic reexamination of 2 cats that were treated for FCGS and no longer showed clinical signs of that disease also showed macroscopic healing of esophagitis. One cat that had a relapse of FCGS showed worsening of esophagitis despite appropriate treatment of esophagitis. Prior medications, salivary and esophageal lumen pH, and chronicity of FCGS signs do not correlate with the degree of esophagitis. The investigators speculated that the virulent oral microbiota of cats with FCGS is transmitted to the esophagus via the saliva, where the production of certain proinflammatory cytokines may contribute to the development of esophagitis. In light of the findings of this study, diagnosis and treatment or empiric treatment of esophagitis may be considered in cats affected by FCGS, especially considering that both diseases share some clinical signs (ie, ptyalism, nausea, and inappetence). 35 ",

Those that had little or no improvement still required medical management at the final recheck examination. A more recent study of 56 cats treated with dental extractions for FCGS showed that 51.8% achieved clinical cure or very significant improvement within a median time of 38 days. 38 Moreover, extent of dental extractions seems to have no impact on outcome. 37,38 Therefore, partial-mouth extraction (plus other teeth that independently have indications for extraction, such as severe periodontitis, retained tooth roots, or resorptive lesions) as the first stage of treatment is the highest evidence-based recommendation. It also has the advantages of reduction in anesthetic time, surgeon fatigue, and surgical trauma. If there is no positive response within 1 to 4 months after partial-mouth extraction, full-mouth extractions may be pursued as the second stage of treatment based on the findings of Druet and Hennet. 37",

However, the results were not statistically significant between the 2 groups, implying that rFeIFN-u is at least as effective as short-term prednisolone in the treatment of FCV-positive cats with refractory FCGS. 40 A recent controlled study showed that subcutaneous administration of rFeIFN-u may be effective for the treatment of FCGS in FCV-positive cats by inhibiting the replication of FCV. 44 Furthermore, a novel rFeIFN (rFeIFN-a15) has been produced via transgenic silkworms that may carry a lower allergy risk, compared with the baculovirus expression system in silkworms by which the current form of rFeIFN-u is produced. 45 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine provides immunosuppressive effects primarily via inhibition of T-cell activation by reducing interleukin-2 expression, a proinflammatory cytokine involved in a positive feedback loop that increases T-cell numbers. 46, 47 It may also have inhibitory effects on B-cell reproduction. 48 In a small retrospective case series that Lee et al examined the efficacy of oral cyclosporine in 8 cats not previously treated with extractions, 4 (50%) of the cats were reported to achieve clinical remission, whereas the rest had partial to fairly good improvement. 49 In a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, prospective clinical trial where oral cyclosporine was administered to 9 cats that had previously been treated with extractions, there was a statistical significance in the number of cats experiencing significant clinical improvement over the 6-week study period between the treatment group (77.8%) and the placebo group (14.3%). 50 Long-term observation was continued in 11 cats, of which 5 (45.5%) were clinically cured after receiving cyclosporine for 3 or more months. 50 ",
