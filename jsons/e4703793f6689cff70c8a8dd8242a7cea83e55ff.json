            "text": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful tool to detect viruses compared with some traditional methods such as the direct fluorescent-antibody assay or virus isolation in cell culture. Real-time PCR is a sensitive system to detect viral genomes, used commonly worldwide [Storch, 2000] . Moreover, multiplex PCR fluorescence techniques are able to identify several genes in one tube simultaneously. Some reports have described simultaneous detection systems for up to 20 viruses using real-time PCR or conventional PCR [Vet et al., 1999; Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007; Mahony et al., 2007; Molenkamp et al., 2007; Nolte et al., 2007; van de Pol et al., 2007; Wada et al., 2009 ]. However, the number of viruses detectable in one tube is limited by fluorescence wavelength. On the other hand, microarray analysis can detect a large number of viruses simultaneously. The weak point of the microarray assay is its low sensitivity and specificity [Wang et al., 2002] .",

An ideal virus screening system may be a system capable of detecting all the human pathogenic viruses simultaneously. In the present study, a real-time PCR system capable of detecting more than one hundred human viruses in a 96-well reaction plate simultaneously was established, designated as the ''multivirus real-time PCR'' system. In this system, two viruses are detected in one well using a duplex TaqMan real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR system; since more than 82 different duplex real-time PCRs are performed in a 96-well plate except wells for standard curve and internal controls, theoretically 163 human viruses can be detected in a 96-well plate simultaneously. Using this system, the distribution and quantification of viruses were investigated in organ specimens from autopsies of 20 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. In addition, clinical samples from patients with uncertain diagnoses were examined to identify the causes of infection.",

Probe-primer sets for each virus were designed using Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (Supplementary Table I ). Probeprimer sets published elsewhere were employed for some of the viruses. Probes and primers were synthesized by Sigma Genosys (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Probes were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) or hexacholoro-6-carboxyfluorescein (HEX)-non-fluorescent Black Hole Quencher (BHQ)-1.

Design of this system, designated as the ''multivirus real-time PCR,'' is shown in Figure 1A . Quantitect Multiplex Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), MicroAmp Optical 96-Well Reaction Plates (Applied Biosystems), and MicroAmp Optical Adhesive Film (Applied Biosystems) were used as 2\u00c2 master mix, 96well plates, and adhesive film, respectively. Each well contains two probe-primer sets with 6-FAM-and HEXlabeled probes, allowing two viruses were to be detected in each well, and the 163 viruses listed in Table I to be detected in a 96-well plate simultaneously. A standard curve was established for nine wells of each plate (A1-A9), which contained FAM-or HEX-labeled probes and primers for green fluorescent protein and glutathione S-transferase genes with control plasmids at 10 1 to 10 7 copies. Thus, an approximate copy number of each virus could be calculated based on the standard curve. To use the system routinely, 2\u00c2 probe-primer mix was stored in a 96-well plate at \u00c0208C. For detection of viruses, DNA and RNA samples (50 ng per well) were added to 2\u00c2 master mix with (for RNA) and without (for DNA) RT. When sufficient amounts of DNA or RNA were not obtained from clinical samples, <50 ng of DNA or RNA per well were applied in this system. Ten microliters of 2\u00c2 probe-primer mix and 10 ml of 2\u00c2 master mix with sample DNA (36 wells) or RNA (60 wells) were then 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 25, 30 1A ).

Tissues were taken at autopsy from various organs of 20 patients with AIDS. All tissues were frozen immediately, and stored at \u00c0808C. The clinical information of the patients is summarized in Table II . A total of 19 patients were male. The mean age of the patients was 41.8 years (range: 19-67 years), and the mean of CD4 counts was 17 cells/ml (range: 0-241). Risk factors for HIV infection in the patients were men who had sex with men (10), heterosexuality (5), and hemophilia (5). At least seven patients had lymphoma, and two had Kaposi's sarcoma. No patients received highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). In addition, 40 clinical samples from patients with uncertain diagnoses were investigated (Table III) . These clinical samples were sent to our department for virus diagnosis. Informed consents were obtained by the clinical doctors. Positive control DNA or RNA samples extracted from virus-infected cells or tissues were kindly provided by many researchers in National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Supplementary Table II ). A: Procedure of the multivirus real-time PCR system. DNA sample was mixed with Quantitect 2\u00c2 master mix, and RNA sample was mixed with Quantitect 2\u00c2 master mix and reverse transcriptase (RT) mix. These mixtures were poured into each well in a 96-well plate at 10 ml per well. Ten microliters of 2\u00c2 probe and primer mix were then added to each well in a premixed 96-well plate. Finally, the virus genes were amplified and detected in a real-time PCR machine for 2 hr. B: Validation of the multivirus real-time PCR. A gene expression image by TreeView software based on the results of the multivirus real-time PCR for control samples is shown. A horizontal line shows each probeprimer set and a vertical line is one sample of positive control. Gray vertical lines indicate no sample. A scale bar indicates copy number of color.

In another patient, parechovirus 3 were detected in cerebral fluids. The presence of these viruses in the samples was confirmed by individual real-time PCR specific for each virus, and conventional (RT-) PCR. Clinical manifestations of these four patients were compatible with the virus infections. In addition, 29 samples from patients with other diseases such as myocarditis, hepatitis, and sudden death were examined. Parvovirus B19, EBV, CMV, HHV-6, HHV-7, and TTV were detected in the samples; however, the titers of these viruses were low.

The sensitivity and specificity of this system are equivalent to those of standard real-time PCR systems ( Supplementary  Fig. 1) , and its sensitivity would be much higher than in microarray systems.

However, once the system is established, the procedure is very easy and takes 3 hr to obtain the results. Thus, the newly developed multivirus real-time PCR could be a useful tool for detecting pathogens in specimens from patients with uncertain diagnoses.",

            "text": "There is little current information about quantification of pathogenic viruses in immunocompromised hosts. Chen and Hudnall [2006] described anatomical mapping of herpes viruses in eight autopsy cases, including two AIDS cases. The multivirus real-time PCR showed that 21 of the 163 probe-primer sets for virus produced positive reactions in AIDS autopsy samples. Many RNA viruses were negative in all cases. Although the low detection rate of RNA viruses might be associated with the quality of extracted RNA, these results suggest that the AIDS patients in the present study were infected with limited types of viruses. TTV and HHV-6 were detected frequently in AIDS autopsy samples and some clinical samples. TTV was identified from a hepatitis patient as a hepatitis-associated virus [Nishizawa et al., 1997] . However, TTV, a ubiquitous virus, was shown to be present in various tissues [Okamoto, 2009] . Although TTV titers were relatively high compared with those of other viruses, broad TTV distribution suggests that it is not associated with specific diseases in immunocompromised hosts. HHV-6 is another ubiquitous virus with which almost 100% of adults are infected. Primary infection of HHV-6 causes exanthema subitum in children [Yamanishi et al., 1988] . Reactivation of HHV-6 may cause hepatitis, pneumonia, and encephalitis in immunocompromised hosts, such as transplant patients [Ljungman, 2002] . The average number of HHV-6 copies in the HHV-6-positive samples in AIDS autopsy was 0.008 copies per cell, suggesting low numbers of HHV-6 copies in the organs. On the other hand, HHV-6 was identified as a possible cause of infection in a clinical case of encephalitis because of extremely high numbers of copies in the serum and clinical manifestations [Ogata et al., 2010] . Thus, a virus's copy number is important information to estimate its etiology. CMV was frequently detected in AIDS autopsy samples by the multivirus real-time PCR system. High CMV copy numbers in the adrenal gland, pancreas and lung were associated with the occurrence of CMV-associated adrenitis, pancreatitis, and pneumonia. CMV was detected frequently in the adrenal gland [Pulakhandam and Dincsoy, 1990] . The results of CMV detection in multivirus real-time PCR were correlated highly with the frequency of CMV inclusion bodies on the slides, suggesting that the occurrence of CMVassociated diseases is associated with virus titers of CMV in organs.",

Although none of the patients received HAART, HIV-1 titers always change in AIDS patients [Ho et al., 1989] ; the autopsy samples might have had insufficient HIV-1 titers for detection by real-time PCR. Also, the probe and primers used in this system might not detect the HIV-1 because of mutations in the target regions. Mutations in HIV-1 occur so frequently that it is difficult to detect HIV-1 using one or two probe-primer sets [Desire et al., 2001; Yun et al., 2002] .",
