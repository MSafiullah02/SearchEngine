Anxiety levels rose even though the human mortality associated with these pandemics paled in comparison to the Spanish Influenza of nearly a century earlier. These pandemics drew attention to the interconnection between humans and the etiological source of the pandemics in animal reservoirs; they spurred the implementation of the global control of such diseases by multidisciplinary teams applying the principles of \u201cOne Health\u201d. Practitioners of One Health strive to generate far-reaching impacts on global health, food security, and poverty alleviation (particularly in developing countries) through interdisciplinary science and integrated control of disease.\n",

            "text": "The One Health concept is not new, though it has been rebranded several times. Its origin lies in comparative medicine, the idea that there is no line between humans and animals when it comes to health and disease. When founding the first veterinary school in Lyon, France in 1761, Claude Bourgelat emphasized the importance of comparative biopathology (Vet2011 2012). Later, Rudolph Virchow, William Osler, and John McFaydean carried the concept forward by incorporating veterinary perspectives into human health care through their respective work in comparative medicine, veterinary pathology, microbiology, and veterinary and medical education (Monath et al. 2010). In the twentieth century, veterinarians Karl Meyer, Calvin Schwabe, and James Steele maintained this inclusive approach through their work on public health and zoonoses (Monath et al. 2010). Schwabe and Steele used the term \u201cOne World, One Medicine, One Health\u201d to refer to their transdisciplinary work (Monath et al. 2010). Missing from this early work in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was the ecologists and environmental health experts. While the pioneers of the One Health concept recognized that environmental factors played a crucial role in the well-being of humans and animals, the value of environmental health for the benefit of the ecosystem itself was not emphasized.",

In contrast with human medicine, the role of the veterinarian in society has greatly expanded since the founding of the first veterinary school in Lyon in 1761. The school was primarily established to combat an epidemic of rinderpest, the most feared disease of cattle in that era that was ravaging France2. Following the establishment of the Lyon veterinary school, veterinary schools3 were soon opened in other countries in Europe and later in other countries around the world. Throughout the nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth century, the focus of veterinary education in these schools was on training veterinarians to control disease in food producing animals, to prevent the transmission of zoonotic diseases, and, importantly, on the clinical care of the horse (riding, draft, and warfare).",

Most veterinarians employed prior to World War II were in rural practice and predominantly involved with livestock. After World War II, the demand for veterinarians specializing in small animal medicine aroses in response to the growing status of companion animals in society (Smith 2011). Today in the USA, approximately 77 % of clinical veterinarians work on companion animals, either exclusively or predominantly; those working on food animals, exclusively or predominantly, represent approximately 8 % (AVMA 2012a). For a profession that was founded on protecting the health of animals in agriculture, eradication of zoonotic diseases, and provision of equine care, this shift toward companion animal medicine in industrialized nations has been dramatic.",

Given the close contact between people and their pets, it is clearly important to consider companion animals in developing the concept.

Until fairly recently, however, work with zoo animals and wildlife reservoirs was motivated more by entertainment and disease eradication goals than a concern for wildlife or ecosystem health. In North America, the Wildlife Disease Association and the American Association of Wildlife Veterinarians were founded in 1951 and 1979, respectively (Fowler 2006).

Collaboration occurs at professional conferences, via journal publications, and over the web on sites such as ProMED-mail (Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, International Society for Infectious Diseases). Surveillance of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus circulation in the field (humans, poultry, and wild birds) and molecular research on the virus conducted in the laboratory serve as an example of the indirect approach. This has involved many veterinarians and physicians working together. This topic is covered in detail by Malik Peiris and Peter Daniels in the next section of this book. Much of this work has been conducted in individual laboratories and then shared at joint conferences, such as the International Symposium on Avian Influenza, the International Meeting on Influenza Interspecies Transmission, and the 4th International Influenza Conference focusing on Zoonotic Influenza and Human Health.

Funding in support of this type of scientific investigation has been traditionally fickle coming in waves for the \u201cdisease du jour\u201d, then quickly receding when the outbreak/epidemic is over and public attention wanes. The introduction of high volume sequencing of suspect agents through metagenomics has opened up the opportunity for this activity to be a scientifically rewarding approach.

Prevalence of multidrug resistance in Salmonella isolates taken from swine production units in the USA is above 50 % (Haley et al. 2012); this translates into increased health risk for those exposed to the industry. Farm workers and food animal veterinarians in Europe are at high risk for exposure to the novel livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in regions with high animal densities and endemic antimicrobial resistance in the agricultural setting (Garcia-Graells et al. 2012).

An example of this is bovine tuberculosis in the state of Michigan, USA.

Cases of bovine tuberculosis were documented in free-ranging white-tailed deer during this time period, and continue to be identified in the northern part of the lower peninsula of the state (Okafor et al. 2011). Eradication of bovine tuberculosis from cattle herds in areas with positive white-tailed deer has been challenging, suggesting continued spill-over from this reservoir host (Waters et al. 2012). Eradication options for infected livestock herds include depopulation (most often applied to beef cattle), and test and remove (most often used in positive dairy herds). Trials are underway to refine vaccines developed to provide protection against bovine tuberculosis for use in both livestock and wildlife (Waters et al. 2012). Successful vaccination campaigns against bovine tuberculosis would improve animal welfare by limiting the impacts of the disease on individual animals and by decreasing the extent of culling operations and associated loss of genetic resources.",

DDT was one of the factors leading to the decimation of Bald Eagle populations and the subsequent inclusion of this species on the endangered species list (USFWS 2007). Weighing the importance of public health needs against these environmental impacts created controversy in the 1960 and 1970s, and eventually led several countries to ban the use of DDT (O\u2019Shaughnessy 2008).

Use of the antiinflammatory drug diclofenac to treat domestic livestock led to a catastrophic decline in the population levels of three vulture species, Gyps bengalensis, G. indicus and G. tenuirostris in Pakistan and India during the 1990 and early 2000s (Oaks et al. 2004). At the time, diclofenac was available as an over-the counter veterinary pharmaceutical and was readily available for use in ruminant livestock. The Governments of India, Pakistan, and Nepal withdrew manufacturing licenses for diclofenac in 2006 (Ogada et al. 2012). Vulture populations continue to decline, however, due to continued prevalence of diclofenac residues in livestock carcasses (Ogada et al. 2012). The potential ecological health effects will be profound if these important scavengers are lost.",
