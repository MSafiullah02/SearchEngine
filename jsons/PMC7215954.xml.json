            "text": "Understanding how human driven systems behave needs to become more sophisticated. We need ways to comprehend human systems that can see past social identities and relations. Theories of the behaviour of complex systems provide a way forward. They provide a separation between complex processes\u2014such as emergence, feedbacks and sensitivity to initial conditions\u2014and the qualitative nature of humans and human society [1]. This does not make people and culture irrelevant to social progress and change (as dominant theories of economics and some strains of the social sciences have professed). Rather, it makes human subjectivity and connection more integral to acting effectively on emergent large-scale health, social and environmental outcomes. The last 30 years has seen a shift occurring towards more sophisticated conceptualisations of health intervention with those grounded in complex systems now gaining legitimacy. This article argues that theories of complex systems provide a way to understand how to achieve change, rather than only describing it [2].",

Whilst failure to act effectively on large-scale health outcomes internationally has led to calls for a paradigm shift away from linear, siloed approaches to health and social intervention [4,5,6,7]. This paper explores two areas of knowledge\u2014the evidence of health inequalities, and what we know about intervening in complex systems. The last two decades have seen the volume of literature and analysis on these subjects increase substantially. The health inequalities literature has become compelling in the evidence it provides of the way social systems produce health outcomes\u2014clearly demonstrating systemic and compounding social processes. Whilst in parallel there has been a significant shift to both normalising complex systems thinking about social challenges, and applying this thinking to social intervention [7,8]. Given we are seeing many aspects of human activity accelerating [9], it seems timely to reflect on what we know about how to intervene effectively.",

In 1998 James Scott described the \u201cblindness\u201d of pre-modern times in relation to the state\u2019s knowledge of characteristics of its populations. He argued that much early modern European activity of the state was rationalising and standardising features of society into administratively convenient forms.

At the same time, big data sources are more accessible and usable with vastly improved transmission enabled by the internet and analytical developments such as machine learning. This increased legibility has far-reaching consequences for the relationship between governments and populations, and state and non-state actors. Although better data and evidence to underpin policy decision-making makes possible discriminating interventions in areas such as public health and welfare - challenges have also arisen. Industries that are harmful to population health have been able to improve their marketing and targeting of products, as well as shift their production to environments with little government regulation. Furthermore, the acceleration in the spread of misinformation and ideologies has tended to increase social polarisation with consequences for political outcomes [12]. Even well-established democracies have become prone to this spread which exploits relationships between social groups.",

Everyone\u2019s wealth would ultimately increase, even if a degree of inequality remained. But this is not what we have seen. Rather than any reasonable, tolerable level of inequality there has been immense and increasing wealth inequality exacerbated by the interaction of population growth and technology. Oxfam, for example, recently reported that 22 men currently own greater wealth than all of the women in Africa [13]. We also now know that capitalism, in its current unfettered form, threatens the ability of the planet to sustain human life through climate and environmental exploitation and degradation. Even where there is political will, advanced democracies are struggling to intervene to regulate and hold to account organisations, corporations and individuals who have accumulated large amounts of wealth and power. The activities of these entities frequently span numerous countries with negative health, social, and environmental impacts on local communities [14].",

Economic theories and positivist social theories which have dominated the last 150 years have largely excluded both the need for, and nature of human connections to each other and to the environment. This exclusion of intimacy within our theoretical and conceptual understandings has legitimised arguments that only value-free economic processes matter for macro human systems, and only abstract measurement constitutes valuable social science. As a result, we have been left with a dearth of theory about large-scale human processes, at a time when we urgently need effective approaches to intervention.",

It shapes the distribution of many large-scale outcomes\u2014including infectious disease epidemics, obesity, heart disease, cancers, and environmental impacts. It influences causal pathways, through systematically advantaging and disadvantaging social groups. The volume of evidence and thinking about how social inequality impacts health outcomes is significant. The measurement and description of health inequality has a deep history stretching back to the mid-1800s when Frederick Engels wrote of the poor health, and short lives, of the working class in Britain [15]. Subsequently health inequality has been described in detail in a number of western countries [16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. Absolute inequality has been shown to exist between countries\u2014for example average life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa is 20 years less than many western countries [23]. We also know that relative inequality matters for health, with big differences in life expectancy between social groups and communities being observed within countries.",

Research continues to illuminate poor local health impacts resulting from the behaviour of industries, such as tobacco and alcohol, when they are left to pursue profit without state regulation and enforcement [34]. Furthermore evidence is accumulating that international trading arrangements and investment policies frequently favour developed economies and powerful transnational corporations with detrimental consequences for already poor communities [35].",

This is where health and social outcomes for particular social groups are shaped by prejudicial interactions occurring throughout the \u201cwhole system\u201d. For example, health, welfare, criminal justice and economic systems in many western countries show poor outcomes for specific groups. In NZ, indigenous M\u0101ori women make up 60% and men more than 50% of the prison population, despite being 15% of the country\u2019s total population. There is also clear evidence that M\u0101ori are systematically disadvantaged in terms of access to, and the journey through, the health system [37]. The same picture emerges from most of our economic and policy systems [38]. Consequently, for almost all health outcomes and their determinants, M\u0101ori fare less well than the general population, with an overall life expectancy seven years less than the NZ/European population [39]. Many have identified this phenomenon as institutional racism. Where rather than an explicit intent to produce inequality, it is the accumulation of interactions, many unintentional, that disadvantage particular groups and lead to measurably poorer outcomes [40].",

Since the 1990s complexity theory began increasingly influencing thinking in a range of social sciences, including the health sciences where its use has become more widely accepted [5,6,7]. Complexity theory sees social phenomena, such as inequality, as the \u201cemergent\u201d result of interacting elements within a social system [52]. Emergent social phenomena are real in that they have an impact on people, the systems that generated them, and wider interacting systems [53]. Social systems evolve and behave like any other system, be it chemical, biological or physical. But social systems are, observably, objectively subjective. Uniquely, we humans have considerable consciousness where we can observe and act on systems at different scales. Through our innate abilities (including empathy and intellect), and through the tools and schemas we have created (such as science and research), we are not only able to observe our physical environment, but also our own social context. The increasing legibility of society has opened the opportunity to more effectively act with consciousness on the trajectories of social systems.",

Through her knowledge of chemical systems Meadows developed a framework of what works to change and transform systems\u2014any system [55]. She identified a hierarchy of levers of change and their effectiveness. These levers include changing information flows, feedback loops, system rules and, at the top of the hierarchy of effectiveness, creating paradigm shifts. These are the deep mechanisms or beliefs on which a system operates. Donella died suddenly in 2001. But her work on system behaviour has gained renewed currency, recently being applied to environmental degradation, the social determinants of health and climate change [56,57,58].

There is also a separate goal (Goal 17) targeting the \u201cmeans of implementation\u201d with sub-goals on this topic written in for all the goals. Even with these intentions some argue that progress shows coherent implementation of actions towards the SDGs is still not occurring [81].

From what we know about health inequality, linear, siloed approaches to solutions will not work. More than this, a reified understanding of interactions between and among goals is not sufficient for effective action [82].

From the centrality of local lived context and agency, where voice and decision-making are currently undervalued, to its multi-level and systemic causes\u2014where disadvantage compounds, power accumulates, and social and political polarisation is accelerating. Even in NZ where there is aspiration and stated commitment through our Voluntary National Review [83] (which showcases many of our domestic health and social policies) to contribute to achieving the SDGs, we are still finding it difficult to make a dent in our own national levels of inequality. Without achieving a real, tangible and reciprocal connection between local communities and high-level goals, poor locally embedded social and environmental outcomes will not change\u2014and will likely worsen. The risk for how we approach action on the SDGs is that it follows the well-worn path of effort and resources accumulating at the top end of problem definition, whilst power relationships are still not devolved and little benefit trickles back down to where outcomes emerge.",

Any argument that implicates genes in differences in outcomes by social group erroneously must paint a picture where there is some neutral state for social systems. There is no such neutral state, there is only underlying system behaviour, which influences the trajectory of human history, interaction, norms and culture. A big mistake of the theory behind the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of free-market capitalism is the belief that social systems are ever neutral, and that activities of the market, left to themselves will naturally find balance. We know this is not true, and we are seeing, the albeit unintentional, outcomes in the form of accelerating inequality and environmental degradation.",

Cultural norms may amplify these biases, but cultural mores and values are modifiable [84]. Because of legibility and our capacity to intervene, culture should be viewed as a necessary ally. This knowledge is already widely used to influence social discord, the results of elections and the consumption of harmful products. Using it to protect human health and Earth seem more worthy goals. But intervening in culture, norms, practices and value systems will not work in a vacuum where power relationships are left undisrupted. Intentions to reduce inequality will fail without conscious and difficult actions being taken to stop the intolerable accumulation of resources; make more permeable and reciprocal the boundaries between social groups; and reverse the system flow which is currently ebbing away from the local and those already disadvantaged. Action on high-level goals such as the SDGs needs to become real and impactful and take a \u201cwhole systems\u201d perspective on the levers it focuses on for systems change. There is substantial thinking, evidence and increasingly useful tools and concepts that can guide social action on systems change\u2014let us begin to use them. Innovation should not be only about creating something new within the confines of existing social systems, we need innovation to transform the systems themselves.",

Given the trajectories evident in our underlying systems, including the way humans are encroaching on habitats and the environment, it is clear we will experience more pandemics which may carry even greater risks. In NZ we are fortunate to currently have a low number of Covid-19 cases and a government that values scientific evidence and is therefore willing to act early. We can do this because we have good leadership, information and resources. We also have strategies in place specific to those in challenging socioeconomic circumstances, and to our M\u0101ori population. Even with these privileges and specific measures, it is likely the health and social consequences of this pandemic will fall unfairly on those already most disadvantaged. Almost certainly, this will be the stark pattern of health outcomes that emerges globally. With hope, lessons can be learned from the unprecedented social disruption the pandemic has caused. Providing a glimpse of what transformational action needs to look like for progress towards making our social and economic systems operate with more compassion, reciprocity, and intimacy within the boundaries of Earth.",
