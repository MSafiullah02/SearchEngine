Methods: We collected epidemiological and clinical information of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a makeshift Fangcang hospital between 7 and 26 February, 2020. The waiting time of each step during the medical care-seeking process was also analysed. Results: Of the 205 patients with COVID-19 infection, 31% had presumed transmission from a family member. 10% of patients had hospital-related transmission. It took as long as a median of 6 days from the first medical visit to receive the COVID-19 nucleic acid test and 10 days from the first medical visit to hospital admission, indicating early recognition of COVID-19 was not achieved at the early stage of the outbreak, although these delays were shortened later. After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: The diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients needs to be accelerated at the epicentre of the outbreak and early isolation of infected patients in a healthcare setting rather than at home is urgently required to stop the spread of the virus. Clinical recovery is not an appropriate criterion to release isolated patients and as long as 4 weeks' isolation for patients with COVID-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of the virus.",

Although restrictive measures, including the unprecedented lockdown of the city on 23 January 2020, were introduced by the Chinese government to contain the spread of the virus, many more cases were detected in Wuhan and far beyond [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . As of 9 March 2020, there were >80 000 confirmed cases and the death toll had risen to 3123 in China. It had also spread to \u2a7e100 countries outside of China and a public health emergency of international concern had been declared by the World Health Organization. While the virus was reported to originate in the Huanan seafood market, which was closed in January 2020 [1] , human-to-human transmission had occurred and became the dominant way for the virus to spread [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The epidemiological features and transmission dynamics of the virus are being investigated worldwide in order to provide better strategies to contain the spread of the virus [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

Although confirmed cases are decreasing in Wuhan, a better understanding of these features is important to curb the spread of the virus and reduce the mortality elsewhere in the world, since a similar outbreak is happening in several other cities, including those in South Korea, Italy and Iran.

However, further analysis of human-to-human transmission is currently unknown due to the implementation of quarantine measures and restricted travel. Many restrictive policies, including home quarantine and traffic control, were applied in Wuhan after the city was locked down. This led to a dramatically changed lifestyle forf the people in the city and may change transmission dynamic of the virus.
