            "text": "L-type lectins possess a luminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that binds to high-mannose-type oligosaccharides in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The L-type CRD is named after the lectins found in abundance in the seeds of leguminous plants, such as concanavalin A from jack beans. The history of L-type lectins is as old as discovery of plant lectins from seeds of leguminous plants in nineteenth century. The structural motifs of L-type lectins are now known to be present in a variety of glycan-binding proteins from other eukaryotic organisms. The domain is present in plant, fungal, and animal proteins, but plant and animal L-type lectins have divergent sequences and different molecular properties. While plant lectins are secreted-soluble proteins and found at high level in specialised tissues, animal L-type lectins are (often membrane-bound) luminal proteins that are found at low levels in many different cell types. This observation suggests that animal L-type lectins have different functions. The crystal structures of some of the legume seed lectins show structural similarities among these lectins and to some other lectins, including the galectins and a variety of other lectins. Therefore, the term \u201cL-lectins\u201d has been designated as a classification for all lectins with this legume seed lectin-like structure. The L-type lectin-like domain has an overall globular shape composed of a \u03b2-sandwich of two major twisted antiparallel \u03b2-sheets. The \u03b2-sandwich comprises a major concave \u03b2-sheet and a minor convex \u03b2-sheet, in a variation of the jelly roll fold (Velloso et al. 2002, 2003; Satoh et al. 2006, 2007).",

In humans and other mammals there are four L-type lectins: ERGIC-53, ERGIC-53 like (ERGL), vesicular integral membrane protein-36 (VIP36), and VIP36 like (VIPL). ERGIC-53 is found only in mammals and VIP36 is restricted to vertebrates, but ERGIC-53 and VIPL are also found in invertebrates. A protein similar to ERGIC-53 is present in the slime mold Dictyostelium dyscoideum, a very simple eukaryote. L-type lectins have different intracellular distributions and dynamics in the ER-Golgi system of secretory pathway and interact with N-glycans of glycoproteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner, suggesting a role in glycoprotein sorting and trafficking. The VIP36 is an intracellular animal lectin that acts as a putative cargo receptor, which recycles between the Golgi and the ER (Hauri et al. 2002).",

Emp46p and Emp47p are L-type lectins from S. cerevisiae which cycle between the ER and the Golgi to facilitate the exit of N-linked glycoproteins from the ER. Unlike ERGIC-53, binding of high mannose glycans does not require a Ca2+ ion. Emp46p binds a K+ ion, which is essential for glycoprotein transport, at a different location to that of Ca2+ ion in ERGIC-53, and Emp47p does not bind any metal ions. The differences in metal binding are evident in the primary structure of the proteins. Members of the galectin family of lectins may be considered as members of the L-type lectin family and are the subject of a separate chapter. The pentraxins are a superfamily of plasma proteins that are involved in innate immunity in invertebrates and vertebrates. They contain L-type lectin folds and require Ca2+ ions for ligand binding (10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_8). Other carbohydrate-binding proteins that may fit into this category are discussed in this chapter.",

Several bacterial toxins such as exotoxin A (ETA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Leech intramolecular trans-Sialidase and Vibrio cholerae Sialidase are known to possess CRD as observed in many lectins. Calnexin (Cnx) and calreticulin (Crt) are homologous chaperones that mediate quality control of proteins in the ER (see 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_2). Both Crt and Cnx are Ca2+-binding proteins, and their carbohydrate-binding activity is sensitive to changes in Ca2+ concentration. Cnx is a type I membrane protein with its carboxy-terminal end in the cytoplasm. The lumenal portion of the protein is divided into three domains: a Ca2+-binding domain (which is adjacent to the transmembrane domain), a proline-rich long hairpin loop called the P domain, and the amino-terminal L-type lectin domain. The Crt has a similar structure, but it is missing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions; it is retained in the ER through its KDEL-retrieval signal at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 7.1)\n",

            "text": "Protein traffic moving from ER to Golgi complex in mammalian cells passes through the tubulovesicular membrane clusters of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the marker of which is the lectin ERGIC-53. Because the functional borders of the intermediate compartment (IC/ERGIC) are not well defined, the spatial map of the transport machineries operating between the ER and the Golgi apparatus remains incomplete. However, studies showed that the ERGIC consists of interconnected vacuolar and tubular parts with specific roles in pre-Golgi trafficking. The identification of ERGIC-53 has added to the complexity of the exocytic pathway of higher eukaryotic cells. A subcellular fractionation procedure for the isolation of the ERGIC from Vero cells provided a means to study more precisely the compartmentalization of the various enzymic functions along the early secretory pathway. The results suggested that in the secretory pathway of Vero cells O-glycan initiation and sphingomyelin as well as glucosylceramide synthesis mainly occur beyond the ERGIC in the Golgi apparatus (Schweizer et al. 1994). The dynamic nature and functional role of the ERGIC have been debated for quite some time. In the most popular current view, the ERGIC clusters are mobile transport complexes that deliver secretory cargo from ER-exit sites to the Golgi. Recent live-cell imaging data revealing the formation of anterograde carriers from stationary ERGIC-53-positive membranes, however, suggest a stable compartment model in which ER-derived cargo is first shuttled from ER-exit sites to stationary ERGIC clusters in a COPII-dependent step and subsequently to the Golgi in a second vesicular transport step. This model can better accommodate previous morphological and functional data on ER-to-Golgi traffic. Such a stationary ERGIC would be a major site of anterograde and retrograde sorting that is controlled by coat proteins, Rab and Arf GTPases, as well as tethering complexes, SNAREs and cytoskeletal networks. The ERGIC also contributes to the concentration, folding, and quality control of newly synthesized proteins (Appenzeller-Herzog and Hauri 2006). Marie et al. (2009)provided novel insight into the compartmental organization of the secretory pathway and Golgi biogenesis, in addition to a direct functional connection between the intermediate compartment and the endosomal system, which evidently contributes to unconventional transport of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to the cell surface. The ERGIC defined by ERGIC-53 also participates in the maturation of (or is target for) several viruses such as corona virus, cytomegalovirus, flavivirus, poliovirus, Uukuniemi virus, and vaccinia virus. Further analysis of the function of ERGIC-53, and the use of ERGIC-53 as a marker protein, should provide novel results about the mechanisms controlling traffic in the secretory pathway.",

            "text": "The most prominent cycling lectin is mannose-binding type I membrane protein ERGIC-53 (ERGIC protein of 53 kDa), a marker for ERGIC, which functions as a cargo receptor to facilitate export of an increasing number of glycoproteins with different characteristics from the ER. The ERGIC-53 is a homo-hexameric transmembrane lectin localized to the ERGIC that exhibits mannose-selective properties in vitro. Two ERGIC-53-related proteins, VIP36 (vesicular integral membrane protein 36) and a ERGIC-53-like protein (ERGL) are also found in early secretory pathway. The homologous lectin VIP36 may operate in quality control of glycosylation in the Golgi. In addition to well-understood role of mannose 6-phosphate receptors in lysosomal protein sorting, the VIP36 functions as a sorting receptor by recognizing high-mannose type glycans containing \u03b11\u2014>2Man residues for transport from Golgi to cell surface in polarized epithelial cells (Hauri et al. 2000a, b). The ERGL may act as a regulator of ERGIC-53. Exit from the Golgi of lysosomal hydrolases to endosomes requires mannose 6-phosphate receptors and exit to the apical plasma membrane may also involve traffic lectins. Analysis of the cycling of ERGIC-53 uncovered a complex interplay of trafficking signals and revealed novel cytoplasmic ER-export motifs that interact with COP-II coat proteins. These motifs are common to type I and polytopic membrane proteins including presenilin 1 and presenilin 7. The results support the notion that protein export from the ER is selective (Yamashita et al. 1999; Hauri et al. 2000b, 2002; Yerushalmi et al. 2001) (Fig. 7.2).\n",

It is, therefore, proposed to recognize high mannose-type oligosaccharides attached to proteins and to transport these glycoproteins from the ER to Golgi apparatus. The ERGIC-53, a member of a putative new class of animal lectins, is associated with the secretory pathway. It is type I transmembrane lectin, which facilitates the efficient export of a subset of secretory glycoproteins from ER. Indeed, the lack of ERGIC-53 impairs the secretion of procathepsin C and blood coagulation factors V (FV) and VIII (FVIII) glycoproteins (Nichols et al. 1998; Vollenweider et al. 1998). Chemical cross-linking studies revealed that ERGIC-53 interacts with procathepsin Z in a mannose- and calcium-dependent manner (Appenzeller et al. 1999; Appenzeller-Herzog et al. 2005). However, ERGIC-53 and its mutant, which is unable to bind to mannose, both coimmunoprecipitate with FVIII, and treatment with tunicamycin does not reduce the interaction between ERGIC-53 and FVIII (Cunningham et al. 2003), which indicates that protein\u2013protein interactions also contribute to this interaction. It is therefore possible that ERGIC-53 also acts as a molecular chaperone in addition to transporting glycoproteins.",

Since leguminous family of lectin proteins possesses a highly conserved invariant asparagine essential for carbohydrate binding, the corresponding mutation in ERGIC-53 as well as a mutation affecting a second site in the putative CRD abolished mannose-column binding and co-staining with mannosylated neoglycoprotein. Based on its monosaccharide specificity, domain organization, and recycling properties, it was proposed that ERGIC-53 functions as a sorting receptor for glyco-proteins in the early secretory pathway (Itin et al. 1996). ERGIC-53 is present as reduction-sensitive homo-oligomers, i.e. as a balanced mixture of disulfide-linked hexamers and dimers, with the two cysteine residues located close to the transmembrane domain playing a crucial role in oligomerization. It is present exclusively as a hexameric complex in cells. Beyond its interest as a transport receptor, ERGIC-53 is an attractive probe for studying numerous aspects of protein trafficking in the secretory pathway, including traffic routes, mechanisms of anterograde and retrograde traffic, retention of proteins in the ER, and the function of the ERGIC.",

Not all peptide sequences of MR60, however, were found in ERGIC-53, raising the possibility that another protein associated with ERGIC-53 might possess lectin activity. This lectin is a type I transmembrane protein which includes a luminal N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytosolic domain (Fig. 7.3). The sequence of MR60 is identical (except for one amino acid) to that of ERGIC-53 (Arar et al. 1995; Schindler et al. 1993).

Using single-stranded mutagenesis, the cysteine residues were individually changed to alanine and the contribution of each of the alpha-helical domains was probed by internal deletions. The N-terminal cysteine to alanine mutants C198A and C238A and the double mutant, C198/238A oligomerized like the wild-type protein. The two membrane-proximal cysteines were found to be necessary for the oligomerization of p58. Mutants lacking one of the membrane proximal cysteines, either C473A or C482A, were unable to form hexamers, while dimers were formed normally. The C473/482A double mutant formed only monomers. Deletion of any of the individual alpha-helical domains had no effect on oligomerization. The dimeric and hexameric forms bound equally well to D-mannose. The dimeric and monomeric mutants displayed a cellular distribution similar to the wild-type protein, indicating that the oligomerization status played a minimal role in maintaining the sub-cellular distribution of p58 (Lahtinen et al. 1999).",

All soluble L-type lectins found to date are multimeric proteins, although all do not have the same quaternary structure. Thus, these lectins are multivalent with more than one glycan-binding site per lectin molecule. The same multivalent principle applies to the membrane bound L-type lectins because the presence of two or more molecules on a membrane surface essentially presents a multivalent situation. The L-type CRD is a \u03b2-sandwich structure with a concave sheet of seven \u03b2-strands and a convex sheet of five. The ligand binding site is in a negatively-charged cleft of conserved residues. Most L-type CRDs require metal ions for ligand binding: in concanavalin A, a transition metal is bound at one site and Ca2+ at the second site. Despite divergent sequences and function, it seems likely that the L-type CRDs have retained similar mechanisms of sugar binding. Certain key residues in four loop regions that contribute to the binding sites in the plant proteins are conserved in all of the animal and plant L-type CRDs. The L-type lectins are distinguished from other lectins primarily on the basis of tertiary structure. In general, either the entire lectin monomer or the CRDs of the more complex lectins are composed of antiparallel \u03b2-sheets connected by short loops and \u03b2-bends, and they are usually devoid of any \u03b1-helical structure. These sheets form a dome-like structure related to the \u2018jelly-roll fold,\u2019 and it is often called a \u2018lectin fold\u2019.

Investigation on the targeting of ERGIC-53 by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that its lumenal and transmembrane domains together confer ER retention (Schokman and Orci 1996). In addition the cytoplasmic domain is required for exit from the ER indicating that ERGIC-53 carries an ER-exit determinant. Two phenylalanine residues at the C terminus are essential for ER-exit. Thus, ERGIC-53 contains determinants for ER retention as well as anterograde transport which, in conjunction with a dilysine ER retrieval signal, control the continuous recycling of ERGIC-53 in the early secretory pathway. In vitro binding studies revealed a specific phenylalanine-dependent interaction between an ERGIC-53 cytosolic tail peptide and the COPII coat component Sec23p. Results suggest that the ER-exit of ERGIC-53 is mediated by direct interaction of its cytosolic tail with the Sec23pSec24p complex of COPII and that protein sorting at the level of the ER occurs by a mechanism similar to receptor-mediated endocytosis or Golgi to ER retrograde transport (Kappeler et al. 1997).",

Cell surface ERGIC-53 is efficiently endocytosed by a mechanism that is disturbed when the two critical lysines of the ER retention motif are replaced by serine residues. Results suggested a similarity between pre-Golgi retention by the double lysine motif and lysine based endocytosis (Kappeler et al. 1994). Although ERGIC-53 contains a cytoplasmic ER-retrieval signal, KKFF, over-expressed ERGIC-53 is transported to the cell surface and rapidly endocytosed. The ERGIC-53 endocytosis signal KKFF and like the ER-retrieval signal require a C-terminal position. In fact, the minimal consensus sequence determined by substitutional mutagenesis was also related to the ER-retrieval consensus (K-K-X-X). Evidence shows that internalization of VIP36, a protein that cycles between plasma membrane and Golgi, is mediated by a signal at its C-terminus that matches the internalization consensus sequence. The relatedness of the two signals suggests that coatomer-mediated retrieval of proteins may be mechanistically more related to clathrin-dependent sorting than previously anticipated (Itin et al. 1995a). Further dissection of the cytoplasmic domain revealed a COOH-terminal di-lysine ER-retrieval signal, KKFF, and an RSQQE targeting determinant adjacent to the transmembrane domain. Surprisingly, the two COOH-terminal phenylalanine residues influence the targeting. They reduce the ER-retrieval capacity of the di-lysine signal and modulate the RSQQE determinant (Itin et al. 1995b).",

Studies suggest that ERGIC is a dynamic membrane system composed of a constant average number of clusters and that the major recycling pathway of ERGIC-53 bypasses the Golgi apparatus (Klumperman et al. 1998). To investigate if ERGIC-53 is involved in glycoprotein secretion, a mutant form of this protein was generated that is incapable of leaving the ER. If expressed in HeLa cells in a tetracycline-inducible manner, this mutant accumulated in the ER and retained the endogenous ERGIC-53 in this compartment, thus preventing its recycling. It was suggested that recycling of ERGIC-53 is required for efficient intracellular transport of a small subset of glycoproteins, but it does not appear to be essential for the majority of glycoproteins (Vollenweider et al. 1998).",

Correctly folded proteins destined for secretion are packaged in the ER into COPII-coated vesicles, which subsequently fuse to form the ERGIC. Multiple coagulation factor deficiency 2 (MCFD2) is a soluble EF-hand-containing protein that is retained in ER through its interaction with ERGIC-53. Exit of soluble secretory proteins from ER can occur by receptor-mediated export as exemplified by blood coagulation factors V and VIII. Their efficient secretion requires ERGIC-53 and its soluble luminal interaction partner MCFD2, which form a cargo receptor complex in early secretory pathway. ERGIC-53 also interacts with two lysosomal glycoproteins cathepsin Z and cathepsin C. In absence of ERGIC-53, MCFD2 was secreted, whereas knocking down MCFD2 had no effect on the localization of ERGIC-53. Endogenous LMAN1 and MCFD2 are present primarily in complex with each other with a 1:1 stoichiometry, although MCFD2 is not required for oligomerization of ERGIC-53. Coimmunoprecipitation of ERGIC-53 and FVIII from transfected HeLa and COS-1 cells and results of the crystal structure of CRD of ERGIC-53 demonstrated an interaction between ERGIC-53 and FVIII in vivo, mediated via high mannose-containing asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, which were densely situated within B domain of FVIII, as well as protein-protein interactions (Cunningham et al. 2003). Perhaps ERGIC-53 and MCFD2 form a cargo receptor complex and that the primary sorting signals residing in the B domain direct the binding of factor VIII to ERGIC-53 1-MCFD2 through calcium-dependent protein-protein interactions. MCFD2 may function to specifically recruit factor V and factor VIII to sites of transport vesicle budding within the ER lumen (Zhang et al. 2003, 2005). These findings suggest that MCFD2- ERGIC-53 complex forms a specific cargo receptor for the ER-to-Golgi transport of selected proteins. However, MCFD2 is dispensable for the binding of cathepsin Z and cathepsin C to ERGIC-53, since ERGIC-53 can bind cargo glycoproteins in an MCFD2-independent fashion and that MCFD2 is a recruitment factor for blood coagulation factors V and VIII (Nyfeler et al. 2006).",

In yeast the UPR affects several hundred genes that encode ER chaperones and proteins operating at later stages of secretion.

The rate of synthesis of the ERGIC-53 protein is also induced by these agents. The response was due to the UPR since it was also triggered by castanospermine, a specific inducer of UPR, and inhibited by genistein. Thapsigargin-induced upregulation of ERGIC-53 could be fully accounted for by the activating transcription factors 6 (ATF6) pathway of UPR. It has been suggested that in mammalian cells the UPR also affects traffic from and beyond the ER (Nyfeler et al. 2003). However, a dilemma has emerged; activation of ATF6, the key regulator of mammalian UPR, requires intracellular transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. This suggests that unfolded proteins might be leaked from the ER together with ATF6 in response to ER stress, exhibiting proteotoxicity in the secretory pathway. It has been found that ATF6 and correctly folded proteins are transported to the Golgi apparatus via the same route and by the same mechanism under conditions of ER stress, whereas unfolded proteins are retained in the ER. Thus, the activation of UPR is compatible with the quality control in the ER and the ER possesses a remarkable ability to select proteins to be transported in mammalian cells in marked contrast to yeast cells, which actively utilize intracellular traffic to deal with unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER (Nadanaka et al. 2004).",

Punctate cytoplasmic structures co-localize with coatomer and ERGIC-53, labeling ER-Golgi intermediate membrane structures. Cycling of VIP36 is suggested by colocalisation with anterograde cargo trapped in pre-Golgi structures and modification of its N-linked carbohydrate by glycosylation enzymes of medial Golgi cisternae. Furthermore, after brefeldin A treatment VIP36 is segregated from resident Golgi proteins and codistributes with ER-Golgi recycling proteins (Fullekrug et al. 1997, 1999).",

Its ability to recognize high-mannose type glycans (Hara-Kuge et al. 1999; Kamiya et al. 2005, 2008) and its broad localization from ER to cis-Golgi (Fullekrug et al. 1999; Shimada et al. 2003a, 2003b) indicates that VIP36 also functions as a cargo receptor that facilitates the transport of various glycoproteins. Proteins that interact with VIP36 during quality control of secretory proteins have been identified. An 80 kDa immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), a major protein of Hsp70 chaperone family, binds VIP36. The interaction between VIP36 and BiP is not due to chaperone-substrate complex. The interaction depends on divalent cations but not on ATP. These observations suggest a new role for VIP36 in the quality control of secretory proteins (Nawa et al. 2007; Kamiya et al. 2008). It was speculated that VIP36 binds to sugar residues of glycosphingolipids and/or glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol anchors and might provide a link between the extracellular/luminal face of glycolipid rafts and the cytoplasmic protein segregation machinery (Fiedler et al. 1994).",

Endogenous VIP36 is localized in trans-Golgi network, on immature granules, and on mature secretory granules in acinar cells and co-localized with amylase. VIP36 is involved in the post-Golgi secretory pathway, suggesting that VIP36 plays a role in trafficking and sorting of secretory and/or membrane proteins during granule formation. EM demonstrated that VIP36 was primarily localized to secretory vesicles in glandula parotis of the rat, where \u03b1-amylase also resided. It was suggested that VIP36 is involved in the secretion of \u03b1-amylase in the rat parotid gland (Hara-Kuge et al. 2004; Shimada et al. 2003a). In GH3 cells endogenous VIP36 is localized mainly in 70\u2013100-nm-diameter uncoated transport vesicles between the exit site on ER and the neighboring cis-Golgi cisterna. The thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation and treatment with actin filament-perturbing agents, cytochalasin D or B or latrunculin-B, caused marked aggregation of the VIP36-positive vesicles and the appearance of a VIP36-positive clustering structure located near cis-Golgi cisterna. The size of this structure, which comprised conspicuous clusters of VIP36, depended on the TRH concentration. Furthermore, VIP36 colocalized with filamentous actin in the paranuclear Golgi area and its vicinity. It suggests that actin filaments are involved in glycoprotein transport between the ER and cis-Golgi cisterna by using the lectin VIP36 (Shimada et al. 2003b).",

At moderate levels of expression, VIP36-SP-FP is localized to the ER, Golgi apparatus, and intermediate transport structures, and colocalized with epitope-tagged VIP36. VIP36-SP-FP recycles in the early secretory pathway, exhibiting trafficking representative of a class of transmembrane cargo receptors, including the closely related lectin ERGIC-53. The VIP36-SP-FP trafficking structures comprised tubules and globular elements, which translocated in a salutatory manner. Simultaneous visualization of anterograde secretory cargo and VIP36-SP-FP indicated that the globular structures were pre-Golgi carriers, and that VIP36-SP-FP segregated from cargo within the Golgi and was not included in post-Golgi TCs (Dahm et al. 2001).",

(2007) determined structures of transport lectin in complex with high mannose type glycans. and determined crystal structures of the exoplasmic/luminal domain of VIP36 alone and in complex with Ca2+ and mannose, Man-\u03b1-1,2-Man (termed Man2, which corresponds to Man(D1)-Man(C), Man(C)-Man(4), Man(D2)-Man(A), or Man(D3)-Man(B) of Man9(GlcNAc)2; and Man-\u03b1-1,2- Man-\u03b1-1,3-Man-\u03b2-1,4-GlcNAc (termed Man3GlcNAc, which corresponds to Man(C)-Man(4)-Man(3)-GlcNAc(2) (Fig. 7.5).",

The S. cerevisiae EMP47 gene encodes a type-I transmembrane protein with sequence homology to ERGIC-53 and VIP36. The 12-amino acid COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Emp47p ends in the sequence KTKLL, which agrees with the consensus for di-lysine-based signals in ER. Despite the presence of this motif, Emp47p is known as a Golgi protein at steady-state. The di-lysine motif of Emp47p was functional when transplanted onto Ste2p, a plasma membrane protein, conferring ER localization. Emp47p cycles between the Golgi apparatus and the ER and requires a di-lysine motif for its \u03b1-COP-independent, steady state localization in Golgi (Schroder et al. 1995).",

            "text": "The profiles of human L-type lectin-like membrane proteins ERGIC-53, ERGL, and VIP36 and optimal alignment of entire CRD of these proteins revealed numerous orthologous and homologous L-type lectin-like proteins in animals, protozoans, and yeast, as well as the sequence of a novel family member related to VIP36, named VIPL for VIP36-like. VIPL has 43% similarity to ERGIC-53 and 68% similarity to VIP36. Its orthologues are broadly distributed in many eukaryotes from human to fission yeast, whereas VIP36 is restricted to higher organisms. This phylogenetic finding suggests that VIP36 evolved from VIPL by gene duplication. VIPL is also predicted to have type I transmembrane topology with a putative CRD homologous to L-type lectins (Neve et al. 2003; Nufer et al. 2003b). Although the structural similarity between VIP36 and VIPL is very high, their characteristics are quite different. VIP36 and VIPL have the same cytoplasmic ER exit motif (KRFY) on their C-termini, but VIPL has an additional arginine at the fifth position from the C-terminus, creating the ER localization motif RKR. As a result, VIPL is a resident of ER (Neve et al. 2003; Nufer et al. 2003b), unlike ERGIC-53 and VIP36, which cycles in the secretory pathway. The sugar-binding activity of VIPL is also thought to be different from those of ERGIC-53 and VIP36; for example, HA-tagged VIPL does not bind to immobilized Man or BSA conjugated to Glc, Man, or GlcNAc as ERGIC-53 does (Nufer et al. 2003b). Moreover, VIPL does not compete with ERGIC-53 for binding to immobilized Man (Nufer et al. 2003b). Based on these observations, VIPL is thought to be an L-type lectin without sugar-binding activity. On the other hand, another group reported that knockdown of VIPL mRNA using short interfering RNA in HeLa cells significantly slowed down the secretion of two glycoproteins (35 and 250 kDa) into the medium (Neve et al. 2003), suggesting that VIPL does function in the secretion of glycoproteins, possibly by serving as an ER export receptor, similarly to ERGIC-53 (c/r Yamaguchi et al. 2007).",

Yamaguchi et al. (2007) examined the sugar-binding activity and specificity of recombinant soluble VIPL (sVIPL) using cells with modified cell surface carbohydrates as ligands. Competition experiments with several high-mannose-type N-glycans indicated that VIPL recognizes the Man1\u20132Man1\u20132Man sequence and that the glucosylation of the outer mannose residue of this portion decreased the binding. Although the biochemical characteristics of VIPL are similar to those of VIP36, the sugar-binding activity of VIPL was stronger at neutral pH, corresponding to the pH in the lumen of the ER, than under acidic conditions. Unlike VIP36 and ERGIC-53 that are predominantly associated with ER membranes and cycle in the early secretory pathway, VIPL is a non-cycling resident protein of the ER. The results suggest that VIPL may function as a regulator of ERGIC-53 (Nufer et al. 2003a).",

            "text": "Fig. 7.2: \nLectin-mediated glycoprotein transport in the secretory pathway. The secretory pathway is composed of membrane compartments specialized in protein folding, modification, transport, and sorting. Several lines of evidence indicate that glycan moieties are essential for folding, sorting and targeting of glycoproteins through the secretory pathway to various cellular compartments. Numerous transient protein-protein interactions guide the transport-competent proteins through the secretory pathway (Lee et al. 2004). Crystallographic and NMR studies of proteins located in ER, Golgi complex and ERGIC have illuminated their roles in glycoprotein folding and secretion. Calnexin and calreticulin, both ER-resident proteins with lectin domains are crucial for their function as chaperones (10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_2). After synthesis and removal of the two outermost glucose residues of their N-glycans many glycoproteins bind to calnexin and/or calreticulin which recognize monoglucosylated N-glycans. Subsequently the glycoproteins are trimmed by glucosidase II (GlcII). Thel incompletely folded protein (marked in white) is reglucosylated by ER enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT) which redirects them to another cycle of quality control. After prolonged time in the ER, ER mannosidase I (ER Man I) removes one mannose residue of the middle branch of the N-glycan. Incompletely folded, and thus reglucosylated, Man8 glycoproteins are targeted for calnexin-dependent retrotranslocation to the cytosol and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. By contrast, correctly folded proteins (marked in black) are no longer recognized by GT after deglucosylation by GlcII and are transport-competent. They may or may not undergo some additional trimming by mannosidase I and II before leaving the ER. Some of these Man7\u20139 glycan-bearing proteins (*) now bind to the lectin ERGIC-53 which recruits them to COPII buds and thereby facilitates transport to the ERGIC. Dissociation of ERGIC-53 and its glycoprotein ligand occurs in the ERGIC and free ERGIC-53 recycles to the ER via COPI vesicles. In the cis-Golgi, glycoproteins are either trimmed to Man5 prior to reglucosylation by Golgi glycosyltransferases, or tagged with the lysosomal signal Man-6-P by sequential action of phosphotransferase (PT) and phosphodiesterase (PD). Some glycoproteins escape cis-Golgi trimming but may be recognized by VIP36 in the trans-Golgi and recycled to the cis-Golgi for another trimming attempt. Proteins carrying Man-6-P residues are recognized by MPRs in the trans-Golgi and sorted to endosomes via clathrin-coated vesicles. Secreted Man-6-P-bearing glycoproteins can also be internalized from the plasma membrane by the large MPR. N-Glycans also serve as signals for Golgi exit and apical targeting in epithelial cells. These processes may also be mediated by lectins that are, however, unknown.
