But as COVID-19 has laid bare, avoidable deaths can proliferate even through the richest societies, if systems are not set up to use resources equitably.\n",

And undocumented workers continue to provide essential services (particularly in food and agriculture) in conditions and for pay that many US citizens refuse to tolerate. The usual precariousness for workers has been exacerbated, with limited systematic support in return.\n",

The outrage of the US\u2019s 40 million unnecessarily food insecure people is now joined by the US\u2019s tragically, preventably large shares of the world\u2019s COVID-19 cases, and deaths (respectively one third, and one quarter).\n",

The mythical shmoos (originally seen in the comic strip L\u2019il Abner) will endlessly and happily transform themselves into every basic material thing a human being needs, but cannot provide any luxury items (Wright 2000). Unsurprisingly, capitalists connive to destroy the shmoos. Wright explains why: for those whose increased prosperity depends on other people working for them for as little pay as possible, everyone getting their basic needs met for free is a tragedy\u2014people might not work, or (worse yet) demand higher pay! For rational, self-interested capitalists, the best solution would obviously be for only capitalists to get shmoos. Second-best? Destroy them\u2014the former status quo was good for capitalists! If forced to further choose, capitalists might concede that everyone getting shmoos is marginally better than the worst case (only workers getting them).",

For them, the first choice IS for everyone to get shmoos: all workers\u2019 basic needs are provided for, but at the same time, the fact that capitalists get them means that they have more resources and thus might (in theory) use them to pay workers more. For workers, the fact that shmoo-owning capitalists might pay workers more is the reason that destroying all the shmoos is actually workers\u2019 last choice.",

But under systems set up to care for people, rather than capital, parity\u2014paying farmers enough for farming to be profitable\u2014would make sense (the median income from farming in the US is negative), as would paying other workers enough to afford fairly priced food. Similarly, healthcare for all would make everyone better off except for, perhaps, capitalists. But here\u2019s the thing about class war: capitalists \u201closing\u201d would just mean fulfilling the promises of rising tides\u2014sharing enough to lift everyone up. So let us unite!
