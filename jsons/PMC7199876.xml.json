            "text": "Acute respiratory infections are frequently experienced after air travel. Because most patients do not see a doctor, current knowledge about incidence and etiology is imprecise and anecdotal [1]. The very few systematic studies available suggested that up to 20% of passengers may develop respiratory infections within 1 week after air travel and that flight attendants show significantly higher incidence rates of respiratory infections than do control groups [2, 3]. Even though antibiotic therapy against common bacterial respiratory disease is often administered, laboratory data on the spectrum of causative agents are actually not available [1, 4, 5]. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 involved a period of heightened awareness of respiratory infections after air travel. Samples for laboratory testing were routinely obtained from patients, which provided a unique opportunity for studying their disease etiologies.",

These patients constitute a specific subcohort of patients with community-acquired respiratory disease. Unlike general cohorts, children and elderly persons are underrepresented, and adults of working age constitute the majority of patients (71% in our study). Normally, respiratory infections in adults are mild and infrequent, but this may change in the context of travel. There is evidence that air travel increases the incidence of respiratory disease in general and that significant transmission in modern aircraft has occurred of SARS, Inf, and other agents of respiratory infection [2, 4]. Because morbidity during working life is economically relevant and new thera peutic options are at hand, investigation into the etiology of travel-associated respiratory disease seems to be well justified.",

However, this made our patients representative of those who are likely to be absent from work. We used up-to-date diagnostic assays to determine the spectrum of viral or atypical agents in these patients. The rate of resolved etiologies was markedly higher than that in studies of community-acquired respiratory infections, including recent collective analyses and some of the latest original studies [5, 13\u201315]. This may be due to the extended spectrum of highly sensitive assays applied.",

Agents with treatment options, such as influenza or atypical bacteria, were present in only 15.4% of flight patients and 15.7% of all patients, making even upto- date diagnostics unrewarding. In this context, it is interesting that lower-respiratory-tract samples did not yield increased detection rates. The general assumption that nasopharyngeal washes are more sensitive than swabs in patients with community- acquired respiratory disease could not be confirmed in our study [5]. Good detection rates and a low risk of aerosolization suggest that swabs should be the preferred in this type of patients.",

Because otherwise healthy adults of working age are usually not tested for respiratory viruses, comparison data from similar cohorts are not available. Our contact patients provided a small control group, and the observed prevalence of viruses confirms the findings seen in flight patients. However, it should be noted that all contact patients fulfilled the case definition of SARS, requiring recent contact with a suspected patient [6].

In our study, it was interesting that significant clusters of patients with the same diagnosis, who could have been on the same flight, did not exist. Similarly, no association was detected between any pathogen and a particular airport. It would thus be likely that viruses are picked up during prior travel rather than being acquired in flight. In any case, data from this unique cohort suggest that the prevalence of known, emerging, and potentially novel respiratory viruses in adults must be carefully studied. Understanding the spectrum and the etiological contribution of viruses in adult respiratory disease will be of growing importance in the future. With new antiviral drugs at hand, more consultations will occur for respiratory diseases. Targeted therapy will require broad-spectrum pathogen detection with rapid results, most likely by PCR. Given the large range of assays required for this study and considering current reagent costs, it is obvious that developing more efficient diagnostic assays is as essential as developing drugs themselves. Today, diagnostic technology is far from attaining this aim.",
