            "text": "As stated by the Ministry of Health, on December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Hubei province, China) notified the identification of 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology with onset on December 8, including 7 severe cases, with a shared history of possible exposure in a market selling shellfish, seafood and live animals in Wuhan City, but no identified source of the outbreak. The market was shut down on January 1, 2020. On January 7, 2020, the Chinese authorities identified a new virus in the Coronaviridae family as the causative agent of the outbreak, temporarily named ''new coronavirus'' (2019-nCoV). The Chinese authorities shared the gene sequence of the virus on January 12, 2020. 1 On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China a global public health emergency. 2 By February 12, more than 45 000 cases had been diagnosed in China, the majority clustered in the province of Hubei (33 000), while more than 450 cases had been notified outside China (https://www.worldometers.info/ coronavirus/), usually in association with cases imported from China ( Figs. 1 and 2) . The reported fatality rates in confirmed cases has ranged from 2% to 3%, although these data must be interpreted with caution given how quickly the outbreak is evolving. 1 The age distribution reflects a low incidence in the paediatric age group (0.9%) associated with a milder course of disease. 3, 4 Based on data of inpatient case series published to date, a high proportion of hospitalised adults and nearly all individuals that died had underlying disease. 5, 6 On January 31, a case of infection by 2019-nCoV was confirmed in La Gomera (Canary Islands, Spain) a German national that was a close contact of another confirmed case in Germany, and on February 9, another positive case was detected in Majorca, corresponding to a citizen of the United Kingdom that was a close contact of a case in France. Both of these cases diagnosed in Spain were in adults and had a mild course.",

Human coronavirus OC43 is the most prevalent, with the majority of cases occurring in children under 5 years. They are often detected in cases of coinfection by other respiratory viruses, which makes it difficult to establish their particular role in disease. These viruses are associated with a greater severity of disease requiring hospital admission, usually due to bronchospasm, especially in children with underlying diseases. There have been fatal cases of HCoV NL63 infection in immunocompromised patients. 10---12 The SARS-CoV was described in 2003 in relation to an outbreak originating in China that caused more than 700 deaths, with 20%---30% of cases requiring mechanical ventilation and a 10% case fatality rate and a very high mortality in patients with underlying disease. The MERS-CoV virus was first identified in 2012 in association with a similar clinical picture, but with a higher fatality rate (36%). This virus has not been fully eradicated and sporadic cases continue to emerge. Both are zoonotic diseases transmitted to humans through animal vectors, bats in the case of SARS and dromedary camels in the case of MERS, although cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported, mainly in health care settings, with a low rate of transmission. 13",

Its efficacy is not clear and it may have been used to manage influenza coinfection. Its use is not recommended at present. \u2022 Inhaled interferon-alfa has been recommended in combination with antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir in adults, and a clinical trial has been set up to assess its efficacy. Interferon-alfa has broad-spectrum antiviral effects and is used to treat hepatitis B virus. Formulations of this drug for inhalation are not currently available in Spain. Chinese guidelines recommend nebulisation of interferon-\u24232b at a dose of 100 000---200 000 IU/kg in mild cases and 200 000---400 000 IU/kg in severe cases, given in twice a day for 5---7 days. \u2022 Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor use for management of HIV in combination with ritonavir as a booster. Lopinavir and/or lopinavir/ritonavir have exhibited activity against coronavirus in vitro. In the management of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, there was evidence that compared to ribavirin alone, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir plus ribavirin decreased the risk of ARDS or death. 33, 34 \u2022 Remdesivir could be the best possible option for treatment of COVID-19. It is an antiviral agent originally developed to fight Ebola in the class of nucleotide analogues. Experiments in animals infected with MERS-CoV found reduced viral titres and an improvement in lung tissue damage in animals treated with remdesivir compared to controls, and that outcomes were better in the group treated with remdesivir compared to the group treated with lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon-\u2424. A phase III clinical trial of remdesivir for treatment of infection by Ebola virus has been completed, and there is ample data on its pharmacokinetics and safety. However, the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be established. This drug is not available in Spain. In the United States, it has been used in at least one patient with favourable results. 35, 36 \u2022 Other drugs such as chloroquine (antimalarial) or baricitinib (Janus kinase inhibitor) have been considered as alternative treatment options, although their use has not been assessed in clinical trials. 37, 38 In conclusion, there currently is no evidence in support or against the use of antiviral therapy or a specific antiviral agent.

Have the patient (if possible) and family members wear surgical masks. Ideally, maintain the patient at least 2 m apart (minimum of 1 m) from all other patients at all times. 2 The staff caring for the patient must adhere to recommended preventive measures (contact and airborne precautions), wearing a FFP2 mask, gloves, a fluidresistant gown and protective goggles to perform physical examinations, during history taking or during sample collection procedures. 3 Administration of commonly used antipyretic agents as needed (paracetamol or ibuprofen). 4 If the patient has fever, we recommend a chest x-ray,",
