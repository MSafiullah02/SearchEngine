            "text": "Coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections in humans and outbreaks of deadly pneumonia worldwide. Infections are initiated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein, which binds to host receptors and fuses the viral and cellular membranes. To understand the molecular basis of coronavirus attachment to oligosaccharide receptors, we determined cryo-EM structures of coronavirus OC43 S glycoprotein trimer in isolation and in complex with a 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. We show that the ligand binds with fast kinetics to a surface-exposed groove and that interactions at the identified site are essential for S-mediated viral entry into host cells, but free monosaccharide does not trigger fusogenic conformational changes. The receptor-interacting site is conserved in all coronavirus S glycoproteins that engage 9-O-acetyl-sialogycans, with an architecture similar to those of the ligand-binding pockets of coronavirus hemagglutinin esterases and influenza virus C/D hemagglutinin-esterase fusion glycoproteins. Our results demonstrate these viruses evolved similar strategies to engage sialoglycans at the surface of target cells.",

Two \u03b2-coronaviruses have caused outbreaks of deadly pneumonia in humans since the beginning of the 21 st century. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and was responsible for an epidemic that spread to five continents with a fatality rate of 10% before being contained in 2003 (with additional cases reported in 2004). The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 and has caused recurrent outbreaks in humans with a fatality rate of 35%. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses that crossed the species barrier using bats/palm civets 1 and dromedary camels 2 , respectively. Four other coronaviruses of zoonotic origin are endemic in the human population, accounting for up to 30% of mild respiratory tract infections and causing severe complications or fatalities in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals 3, 4 . These viruses are HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E (\u03b1-coronaviruses) and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (\u03b2-coronaviruses). Currently, no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are available to combat any human coronavirus. Furthermore, future cross-species transmission events of coronaviruses seem likely, given the large reservoir found in bats [5] [6] [7] . Studying coronaviruses will therefore help in understanding the principles governing cross-species transmission and adaptation to humans and in preparing for putative future zoonotic outbreaks.",

S is the main antigen present at the viral surface and is the target of neutralizing antibodies during infection. As a result, it is a focus of vaccine design. S is a class I viral fusion protein synthesized as a single polypeptide chain precursor of approximately 1,300 amino acids 8 . For many coronaviruses, S is processed by host proteases to generate two subunits, designated S 1 and S 2 , which remain non-covalently bound in the pre-fusion conformation. The N-terminal S 1 subunit comprises four \u03b2-rich domains, designated A, B, C and D, with domain A or B acting as receptor-binding domains in different coronaviruses. The transmembrane C-terminal S 2 subunit is the metastable spring-loaded fusion machinery 9 . During entry, S 2 is further proteolytically cleaved at the S 2 \u2032 site, immediately upstream of the fusion peptide 10 . This second cleavage step occurs for all coronaviruses and is believed to activate the protein for membrane fusion, which takes place via irreversible conformational changes [11] [12] [13] [14] . In recent years, cryo-EM work led to the determination of coronavirus S glycoprotein ectodomain structures in the pre-fusion and post-fusion states, providing snapshots of the start and end points of the fusion reaction 9, 13, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S glycoproteins in complex with human neutralizing antibodies also informed about the mechanism of fusion activation 25 .",

Molecular clock analysis of genome sequences suggested that HCoV-OC43 originated from a zoonotic transmission event of a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and dated their most recent common ancestor between the 1890s and the 1950s 26, 27 . HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) use 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) as a receptor, which is terminally linked to oligosaccharides decorating glycoproteins and gangliosides at the host cell surface 28, 29 . The S glycoprotein of these viruses mediates 9-O-Ac-Sia binding, whereas the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein acts as receptor-destroying enzyme, via sialate-O-acetyl-esterase activity, to facilitate release of viral progeny from infected cells and escape from attachment to non-permissive host cells or decoys [30] [31] [32] [33] . These properties are shared with the hemagglutinin-fusion-esterase (HEF) glycoproteins of influenza C and D viruses 28, [34] [35] [36] .",

Previous biochemical work established that domain A of coronavirus S glycoproteins mediates attachment to oligosaccharide receptors, such as for HCoV-OC43 and BCoV, which interact with 9-O-Ac-Sia 28,40,41 , or MERS-CoV, which binds to \u03b12,3-linked (and to a lesser extent to \u03b12,6-linked) sialic acids, with sulfated sialyl-Lewis X being the preferred binder 42 . On the basis of the galectin-like fold of domain A of coronavirus S and mutational analyses, it was suggested that key saccharide-binding residues locate to the viral membrane distal side of the BCoV \u03b2-sandwich. Our recent work, however, indicated that the 9-O-Ac-Sia binding site of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV and PHEV is conserved among these viruses and resides at a distinct location of domain A 43 . Although we validated the findings using mutagenesis and BCoV infectivity assays, no structural information is available on the mechanism of coronavirus interaction with saccharides aside from in silico modeling 43 . This knowledge gap limits our understanding of the roles of these receptors in viral infection or zoonosis and hinders the rational design of inhibitors.",

We show that the ligand binds with fast association/dissociation kinetics in a groove on HCoV-OC43 S located at the surface of domain A. Site-directed mutagenesis combined with binding experiments validated our structural findings, and infectivity assays showed that the residues involved in 9-O-Ac-Sia binding are essential for HCoV-OC43 S-mediated entry into host cells. Our results further show that binding to free 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia and/or acidic pH did not induce fusogenic conformational changes of S, suggesting that multivalent interactions with sialoglycans and/or further attachment to a putative proteinaceous receptor 44 are essential to promote membrane fusion. The receptor-interacting site is conserved in all coronavirus S glycoproteins known to attach to 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans and shares architectural similarity with the ligand-binding pockets of coronavirus HEs and influenza virus C/D HEF glycoproteins, thus highlighting common structural principles of recognition 45, 46 .",

The 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia C1-carboxylate forms a salt bridge with the Lys81 side chain amine and a hydrogen bond with the Ser83 side chain hydroxyl ( Fig. 2c and Supplementary  Fig. 3 ). The 5-nitrogen atom of the ligand makes a hydrogen bond with the Lys81 backbone carbonyl (Fig. 2c) . The ligand N-acetyl methyl inserts into the P2 hydrophobic pocket, defined by residues Leu80, Trp90 and Phe95. The ligand 9-O-acetyl methyl docks in the P1 hydrophobic pocket, which comprises Leu85, Leu86 and Trp90, whereas the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl makes a hydrogen bond with the Asn27 side chain amide. These observations rationalize the specificity of HCoV-OC43 S for this sialoside, because the 9-O-acetyl group is accommodated by a combination of hydrogen bonding and shape complementarity (Fig. 2b,c) , similarly to 9-O-Ac-Sia binding sites of coronavirus, torovirus and orthomyxovirus HEs/HEFs [32] [33] [34] [35] 43, 54 . Although most interactions occur with the same side of the ligand, the side chain hydroxyl of residue Thr31, which faces the 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia solvent-exposed side, forms a hydrogen bond with the Trp90 indole nitrogen. This interaction participates in stapling the A domain N-terminal segment to the \u03b2-sandwich core and contributes to defining the shape of the ligand-binding groove (Fig. 2c) . Overall, the ligand buries 350 \u00c5 2 of its surface upon binding to the HCoV-OC43 S protein, corresponding to approximately 62% of the 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia total solvent-accessible surface area. The observed binding mode is compatible with interactions with longer oligosaccharides, including \u03b12,3and \u03b12,6-linked sialoglycans found on cell surfaces. ",

Domain A bound to and dissociated from 6-sialyl-5-N,9-O-acetyl-lactosamine (9-O-Ac-6SLN) with fast on and off rates. (Fig. 3a) . The observed binding was specific, as it was critically dependent on the presence of the sialate-9-O-acetyl moiety, in accordance with previous observations 28, 32, 43, 55 . Domain A did not detectably bind to the corresponding non-O-acetylated oligosaccharide, 6SLN. This finding is explained by the absence of the 9-O-acetyl moiety in 6SLN, which contributes one-third of the total ligand buried surface area by contacting Asn27 and the P1 pocket of the glycoprotein, as revealed in our structure (Fig. 2b,c) . Moreover, binding was largely abolished by de-O-acetylation of biosensor-bound 9-O-Ac-6SLN with porcine torovirus HE (Fig. 3a) . Finally, substitution of Trp90 with alanine abrogated interactions with 9-O-Ac-6SLN (Fig. 3a) , thereby confirming the central role for sialoside attachment of this amino acid residue that defines the floor of the ligand-binding groove 43 .",

We calculated a halflife of t 1/2 = 0.7 s from the dissociation curves, a dissociation rate constant k off = 1 s \u22121 (k off = t 1/2 /ln 2 ) and an association rate constant k on = 1.4 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 s \u22121 . These values predict rapid S-mediated virion attachment, particularly in high-density receptor environments such as the mucus layer, glycocalyx and cell surfaces. On the basis of these results, the mean life (1/k off ) of the 1:1 complex is predicted be short, in the order of 1 s, much shorter than the mean life of an individual influenza A hemagglutinin receptor-binding domain in complex with sialic acid, which ranges between 7 and 13.5 s 56 . In the context of authentic virions, however, the large number of S glycoproteins at the surface of coronaviruses is likely to increase the apparent binding affinity for sialoglycans through avidity, as described for influenza virus 57 . We posit that HCoV-OC43 and related \u03b2-coronavirus S glycoproteins evolved to dynamically interact with host sialosides and avoid irreversible attachment to decoy receptors via HE-mediated virion elution. Dynamic binding in combination with receptor destruction could promote virion motility by directional sliding diffusion through high-density interaction sites, as recently reported for influenza A and C viruses [58] [59] [60] . HCoV-OC43 S attachment to 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans is necessary for viral entry. Our structure rationalizes the results of our previous study in which the effect of individual HCoV-OC43 S domain A substitutions was assessed using a solid-phase lectin binding assay 43 . Substitution of Lys81 or Ser83 with alanine completely abrogated binding, as expected on the basis of our holo-HCoV-OC43 S structure, owing to disruption of the aforementioned electrostatic interactions with 9-O-Ac-Sia. Moreover, mutations of Leu80, Leu86 or Trp90 also disrupted binding, probably as a result of alteration of the P1 and/or P2 hydrophobic pockets accommodating the ligand 9-O-acetyl and 5-N-acetyl methyl groups, respectively. On the basis of our structure, we predicted that substitution of Asn27 with alanine would also inhibit binding, owing to loss of a hydrogen bond between the ligand 9-O-acetyl carbonyl and the Asn27 side chain amide. Using the same solid-phase lectin-interaction assays, we show that this substitution resulted in a loss of detectable binding, further validating our cryo-EM results (Fig. 3d) .",

To validate this finding, we investigated the effect of ligand binding to wild-type HCoV-OC43 S (that is, with a native S 1 /S 2 cleavage site sequence) in various biochemical conditions. Importantly, the HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer remained uncleaved after secretion ( Supplementary Fig. 4a) , perhaps owing to the paucity of furin present in the secretory pathway of HEK293F cells 61 . Incubation of the wild-type HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer with trypsin at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 28 \u00b5g\u2022ml \u22121 (w/v), to recapitulate proteolytic priming 13 , led to cleavage at the S 1 -S 2 boundary, as observed via SDS-PAGE ( Supplementary Fig. 4a) . Incubation with 28 \u00b5g\u2022ml \u22121 trypsin also led to cleavage of a small fraction of S at a second site, yielding a band with an apparent molecular weight of ~55 kDa, which could be consistent with cleavage at the S 2 \u2032 site ( Supplementary Fig. 4a) , an event believed to be restricted to fusion triggering upon receptor engagement for SARS-CoV S 11 or MERS-CoV S 12, 62 . EM analysis of negatively stained samples, however, showed that the HCoV-OC43 S trimers remained in the pre-fusion conformation and were highly stable, even at the highest trypsin concentration tested (Supplementary Fig. 4b) . Furthermore, we did not detect conformational changes (i) of pre-cleaved wild-type HCoV-OC43 S incubated with 100 mM 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia, (ii) after trypsin cleavage of 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia-bound wild-type HCoV-OC43 S or (iii) of pre-cleaved wild-type HCoV-OC43 S incubated at pH 4.5 ( Supplementary Fig. 4c-f ).

In the latter conditions, we noticed the formation of HCoV-OC43 S rosettes arising from the nonspecific interactions of multiple post-fusion trimers via the hydrophobic fusion peptides (Supplementary Fig. 4h) . These biochemical conditions lowered the energy barrier between the metastable pre-fusion state and the post-fusion (ground) state, acting as a surrogate for receptor-mediated fusion activation. This finding indicated that the wild-type HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain trimer could refold to the post-fusion conformation, although neither free 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia nor pH acidification triggered this transition. It has been previously established that caveolin-mediated endocytosis is a major route of HCoV-OC43 entry into host cells 63 . Because we demonstrated interactions of sialoglycans with the identified site are necessary for S-mediated viral entry, we hypothesize that membrane fusion occurs upon formation of multivalent interactions with sialoglycans (via mechanical destabilization of the pre-fusion trimers) and/or binding to a putative proteinaceous receptor 44 , before or after virus internalization. In conclusion, 9-O-Ac-Sia-containing receptors appear to differ from the proteinaceous SARS-CoV receptor, because addition of monomeric angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ectodomain to wild-type SARS-CoV S trimers, in the presence of trypsin, promoted refolding to the post-fusion state 23, 25 .",

Strikingly, BCoV HE and influenza HEF similarly interact with 9-O-Ac-Sia, despite ample differences in the architecture of their ligand-binding pockets 33, 34, 43 . Specifically, the two methyl groups of the ligand are docked into two hydrophobic depressions separated by an aromatic amino acid side chain, and hydrogen bonds are formed with the 5-nitrogen of the neuraminic acid core and the 9-O-acetyl carbonyl (Fig. 5a-c) . The similarity across the three binding sites is reinforced by the observation that 9-O-Ac-Sia buries a comparable surface area at the interface with each of these glycoproteins and that the 9-O-acetyl moiety makes a major contribution to it in all three cases (~110 \u00c5 2 ). One notable difference, however, is that the C1 carboxylate anchors the ligand to HCoV-OC43 S via a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond, whereas it relies on the formation of one or two hydrogen bonds with the BCoV HE or influenza HEF lectin domains, respectively. These results expand on our previous biochemical work 43 to demonstrate that BCoV HE and influenza HEF use structural principles similar to those of other 9-O-Ac-sialoglycan-recognizing human and animal coronaviruses for engagement to host cell receptors.",

This site is conserved in all other coronaviruses known to attach to 9-O-Ac-Sia, including HCoV-HKU1 S (another endemic human coronavirus), and BCoV S (the presumptive zoonotic ancestor of HCoV-OC43). Our results provide a molecular framework explaining the specific recognition of 9-O-Ac-Sia-decorated oligosaccharides present at the surface of host cells targeted by these viruses. The \u03b2-sandwich architecture of domain A is conserved among all coronaviruses, and some of them feature a duplication of this domain at the S glycoprotein N-terminal region 16 . Other coronaviruses like MERS-CoV (\u03b2-coronavirus), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, \u03b3-coronavirus), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (\u03b1-coronavirus) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (\u03b1-coronavirus) have been described to also bind to sialoglycans (distinct from 9-O-Ac-sialosides) via their A domains during host cell infection 42, [64] [65] [66] . The ligand-binding pocket identified in the holo-HCoV-OC43 S structure is not conserved in the MERS-CoV or in the IBV A domains, for which structures are available, suggesting that host attachment of this subset of viruses involve different interactions. The conserved topology of domain A among coronavirus S glycoproteins indicate that it derived from divergent evolution of an ancestral galectin domain. Viral evolution and adaptation thus lead to the use of distinct binding residues on the same domain putatively to acquire different ligand specificities such as 9-O-Acsialosides versus non-O-acetylated-sialoglycans. This evolutionary plasticity is reminiscent of what has been described for the BCoV HE lectin domain in comparison with influenza A/B hemagglutinin and influenza C/D HEF 33, 35 .",

Modulation of attachment to sialoglycans can therefore have profound effects on zoonotic transmission, tropism and virulence of many viruses. For instance, a single point mutation in the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus hemagglutinin was proposed to account for most of the preference switch from avian enteric tract receptors (\u03b12,3-linked sialic acid) to human respiratory tract receptors (\u03b12,6-linked sialic acid) 57 . Although influenza A/B hemagglutinin, influenza C/D HEF and coronavirus HE have distinct architectures compared with those of coronavirus S glycoproteins, common rules of ligand engagement emerge. These rules also appear to extend to the interactions of sialoglycans with adenoviruses 67 and reoviruses 68 . In all cases, sialic acid binding involves burying a small surface area (300-400 \u00c5 2 ) through contacts with a solvent-exposed groove of the protein. One face of the sialic acid ligand makes extensive interactions with the viral proteins, whereas the opposite, solvent-exposed face, makes few contacts. The binding affinity for sialic acids usually ranges between the micromolar and millimolar range, and the aforementioned viruses display numerous oligomeric spikes to enhance adsorption to target receptors through avidity 57 .",

In contrast, influenza hemagglutinin cannot accommodate 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acids, owing to steric restrictions, but a subset of hemagglutinins can bind to N-glycolyl neuraminic acids 57, 69 . The HCoV-OC43 S, HCoV-HKU1 S, BCoV S and PHEV S glycoproteins therefore share the ligand specificity of influenza C/D HEF but are functionally more similar to influenza A/B hemagglutinin, by carrying receptor attachment and membrane fusion functions, whereas a dedicated HE (coronaviruses) or neuraminidase (influenza A/B) is responsible for the receptor-destroying activity. In conclusion, our results illuminate how coronaviruses recognize 9-O-Ac-sialosides to enable infection of susceptible cells and show that a conserved strategy is utilized to engage such ligands across coronaviruses and orthomyxoviruses.",

The fragment encoding the HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain (residues 15-1263, UniProtKB: Q696P8) was amplified by (RT-)PCR from the viral genome and placed into a modified pCAGGS mammalian expression vector with a CD5 N-terminal signal peptide (MPMGSLQPLATLYLLGMLVASVLA) and an engineered C-terminal extension encoding a GCN4 trimerization motif (IKRMKQIEDKIEEIESKQKKIENEIARIKKIK), a thrombin cleavage site (underlined) (LVPRGSLE), and an eight-residue Strep-tag (WSHPQFEK) followed by a stop codon, as previously described 9, [15] [16] [17] . This construct results in fusing the GCN4 trimerization motif in register with the HR2 helix at the C-terminal end of the HCoV-OC43 S-encoding ectodomain sequence. A mutant gene carrying three R-to-G amino acid mutations to abolish the furin cleavage (754-RRSRG-758 \u2192 754-GGSGG-758) at the S1-S2 junction (S2 cleavage site) was also generated following the same strategy. A pCAGGS vector encoding the HCoV-OC43 S domain A (residues 1-306) C-terminally extended with a thrombin cleavage site followed by the Fc region of human IgG was generated as described previously 70 .Protein expression and purification. HEK293F cells were grown in suspension using FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Life Technologies) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 8% CO 2 incubator rotating at 130 r.p.m. Wild-type or mutant HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain construct were transfected into 250 ml cultures with cells grown to a density of 1 million cells per milliliter using 293fectin (ThermoFisher Scientific). After 4 d, supernatant was collected, and cells were kept in culture for an additional 4 d, yielding two harvests per transfection. Recombinant wild-type or mutant HCoV-OC43 S ectodomain was purified from clarified supernatants using a 1 ml StrepTrap column (GE Healthcare). Purified proteins were concentrated and flash frozen in Tris-saline buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) prior to negative staining and cryo-EM analysis.Negative stain electron microscopy. Protein samples were adsorbed to glowdischarged carbon-coated copper grids for 30 s prior to 2% uranyl formate staining. Micrographs were recorded using the Leginon software 71 on a 120 kV FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit with a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera at 67,000 nominal magnification. The defocus ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 \u00b5m, and the pixel size was 1.6 \u00c5.",

The samples were subsequently incubated: either overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 100 mM 9-O-Ac-sia; 25 min at 50 \u00b0C; or 30 min at pH 4.5 using 20 mM sodium citrate buffer before being analyzed via negative-staining EM and SDS-PAGE.Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection. Three microliters of HCoV-OC43 S at 1 mg\u2022ml \u22121 was applied to a 2/2 C-flat grid (Protochips) that had been glow discharged for 30 s at 20 mA. After preferential orientation was observed, 2.7 \u00b5l of HCoV-OC43 S at 10 mg\u2022ml \u22121 was mixed with 0.3 \u00b5l of n-Octyl-\u03b2-Dglucopyranoside (OG) 180 mM immediately before being applied to a glowdischarged grid. Thereafter, grids were plunge frozen in liquid ethane using an FEI Mark IV Vitrobot with a 6.5-7.5 s blot time at 100% humidity and 20 \u00b0C. Incubation of 1.1 \u00b5M HCoV-OC43 S with 100 mM 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-sia) was performed overnight at 4 \u00b0C, and immediately before vitrification, OG was added to the mixture reaction at a final concentration of 18 mM. Data were acquired using an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector and Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter, operated in zero-loss mode with a slit width of 20 eV. Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon 71 at a nominal magnification of 130,000\u00d7 with a pixel size of 0.525 \u00c5 for apo-HCoV-OC43 S (super-resolution mode) and 1.05 \u00c5 for holo-HCoV-OC43 S (counted mode). The dose rate was adjusted to 8 counts/pixel/s, and each movie was dose-fractionated in 50 (apo) or 60 (holo) frames of 200 ms. A total of 2,211 and 2,402 micrographs were respectively collected for apo-and holo-HCoV-OC43 S, with a defocus range between 1.3 and 1.8 \u03bcm.Cryo-EM data processing. Movie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrast-transfer function parameters, particle picking and extraction were carried out using Warp 72 . Particle images were extracted with a box size of 800 binned to 400 for apo-HCoV-OC43 S or with a box size of 400 for holo-HCoV-OC43 S, both yielding a pixel size of 1.05 \u00c5. Reference-free 2D classification in Relion was used to parse particles from the original 197,791 and 332,912 for apo-and holo-HCoV-OC43 S, respectively. The MHV S cryo-EM map 9 was used to generate an initial model of apo-HCoV-OC43 S. The initial model of holo-HCoV-OC43 S was generated using the apo-HCoV-OC43 S map. Relion 3D classification without symmetry was used to select ~83,000 and ~178,000 particles from apo-and holo-HCoV-OC43 S, respectively. CTF refinement in Relion3.0 (ref. 73 ) was used to refine per-particle defocus values. Particle images were subjected to the Bayesian polishing procedure implemented in Relion3.0 (refs. 73, 74 ) before performing another round of per-particle defocus refinement. The particles were then subjected to 3D classification without refining angles and shifts using the same soft mask as that used during 3D refinement and with a tau value of 30. Final 3D refinement of the apo-and holo-HCoV-OC43 S datasets imposing C3 symmetry was carried out using non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC 75 and yielded reconstructions at 2.9-and 2.8-\u00c5 resolution, respectively. Local resolution estimation, filtering and sharpening was carried out using CryoSPARC. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143 criterion 76 , and FSC curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by highresolution noise substitution 77 . Cryo-EM model building and analysis. UCSF Chimera 78 and Coot 79 were used to fit the MHV atomic model (PDB 3JCL) into the holo-HCoV-OC43 S cryo-EM map. The models were subsequently manually rebuilt using Coot 79 . N-linked glycans were hand built into the density where visible, and the models were rebuilt and refined using Rosetta [80] [81] [82] [83] . Models were analyzed using MolProbity 84 , Privateer 85 and PISA 86 . Figures were generated using UCSF Chimera 78 and ChimeraX 87 . Analysis of the ligand-binding site electrostatic surface potential was performed using PDB 2PQR 88 and APBS 89 .Biolayer interferometry. HCoV-OC43 S1A-Fc was expressed in HEK293T cells and purified from the cell culture supernatant by protein A chromatography, as described 43 . Monomeric domain A, wild type or with a W90A substitution, was subsequently obtained by on-the-bead thrombin cleavage 33 , after which the proteins were concentrated to up to 3.8 mg\u2022ml \u22121 in PBS, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use. Biolayer interferometry analysis was performed on an Octet RED384 machine. All assays were performed using Fortebio Kinetics Buffer (KB; PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 0.02% Tween20 and 0.05% sodium azide) at 30 \u00b0C. Synthetic biotinylated 6-sialyl-5-N-,9-O-acetyl-lactosamine (9OAc6SLN) or 6-sialyl-5-N-acetyl-lactosamine (6SLN) dissolved to 100 nM were loaded onto streptavidin (SA) biosensors to maximum loading levels (until no further increase in reflection was observed). Sensors were washed in KB until a stable baseline was obtained. Binding of monomeric HCoV-OC43 S domain A was performed by moving receptor-loaded sensors to wells containing 100 \u03bcl of purified protein, dissolved in KB to various concentrations, for up to 3 min, then dissociating for 3 min dissociation. To abolish unspecific binding, sensors were subjected to five successive association/dissociation cycles. To test whether binding of domain A was sialate-9-O-acetyl-dependent, biosensors loaded with 9OAc6SLN were de-O-acetylated by dipping them in wells containing 20 \u03bcg\u2022ml \u22121 porcine torovirus P4 HE-Fc 45 in KB for 30 min, then washing prior to association/dissociation (pre-HE) or after a cycle of association/dissociation, upon which the biosensors were subjected to a final cycle (post-HE). The equilibrium dissociation constant, K D , was determined from three independent experiments with the 'Response' option of the Octet Data Analysis software. The half-life of the domain A-9OAc6SLN complex was calculated manually from the dissociation curves.Pseudovirus entry assays. HCoV-OC43 S-pseudotyped VSV-\u0394G particles were prepared as previously described 43 . Briefly, HEK293T cells at 70% confluency were transfected with PEI-complexed plasmid DNA. For coexpression of HCoV-OC43 S and BCoV HE-Fc, S expression vectors and pCD5-BCoV HE-Fc were mixed at molar ratios of 8:1. At 48 h after transfection, cells were transduced with VSV-G-pseudotyped VSV\u0394G/Fluc 90 at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Cell-free supernatants were harvested at 24 h after transduction and filtered through 0.45\u03bcm membranes, and virus particles were purified and concentrated via sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation at approximately 100,000g for 3 h. Pelleted virions were resuspended in PBS and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use. Inoculation of HRT18 monolayers in 96-well format was performed with equal amounts of S-pseudotyped virions, as calculated from VSV-N content (roughly corresponding to the yield from 2 \u00d7 10 5 transfected and transduced cells), diluted in 10% FBSsupplemented DMEM. At 18 h post infection, cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase expression was measured using a firefly luciferase assay system. Infection experiments were performed independently in triplicate, each time with three technical replicates. Pseudovirus incorporation of flag-tagged OC43 S was determined for the parental type and each of the mutants via Western blotting and by calculating the S content (measured with monoclonal antibody ANTI-FLAG M2; Sigma) relative to that of VSV-N (measured with anti-VSV-N monoclonal antibody 10G4; Kerafast).",
