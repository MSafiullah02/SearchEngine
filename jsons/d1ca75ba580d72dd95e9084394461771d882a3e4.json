Panic buying (PB)/ increased buying behavior has been observed during public health emergencies since the ancient period. However, the exact psychological explanation responsible for it has not sought systematically. Therefore, we intended a thrust to identify the possible psychological explanations behind the panic buying behavior during crisis moments such as, pandemics.",

During a crisis period, people generally like to control things and this brings them some aspect of certainty (Wilkens, 2000) . People don't want to get engaged in any kind of debate, and the moral insecurity pushes them to take action to alleviate anxiety and bring back the feeling of control (Yap, 2020) . The phenomenon may be explained as a remedial response to reduce fear and anxiety of losing control over the surrounding environment (Dholakia 2020). As there prevail extraordinary uncertainty, individuals anticipate regret if they fail to collect necessaries when they are available. Moreover, people have not to control the pandemic creating the wish to have control at least something those are needed during the crisis (Bonneux and Van Damme 2006).",

The phenomenon can also be attributed to similar things that happened during other epidemics and natural calamities in the past. Stockpiling of drugs and vaccines is regarded as a method of preparation in cases of pandemics (Jennings et al., 2008) .
