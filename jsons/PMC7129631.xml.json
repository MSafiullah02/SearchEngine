The national commitment to primary care and public health was operationalised through a rural cooperative medical system based on legions of so-called barefoot doctors and huge public health campaigns.1 The revolutionary slogan \u201caway with all pests\u201d symbolised the popular attitudes towards malaria, schistosomiasis, trachoma, sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis, and a host of infectious diseases that affected the nation.2 Although China's global economic competitiveness benefited immeasurably from these advances in primary care and public health in the late 20th century, economic reforms after 1978, had the unintended consequence of reducing primary care access, especially in vast rural China when the cooperatives were dissolved.3, 4\n",

However, the world's largest population\u2014about one in five people in the word live in China\u2014now faces the need to rebuild its health system.5, 6 China risks diluting its primary care and preventive focus in the face of medical commercialisation. China is coping with new health challenges related to modernisation and an aging population as a result of longer life expectancies and the nation's one child policy. Rising health-care costs in an aging population with commensurate non-communicable diseases are sure to serve as an economic drain on the Chinese economy, as in high-income countries and other rapidly developing nations like Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa (ie, BRICS countries like China).7\n",

A wide appreciation now exists that emerging infectious diseases from China could have a global effect, as with influenza reassortants that could humanise virulent avian or porcine strains. For example, influenza viruses could emerge more easily in China in view of human and animal population densities and traditions of food consumption and open marketplaces.9 Worldwide travel and commerce with the world's largest manufacturing and exporting nation are of a magnitude to spread any human infectious disease far from an emerging epicentre. Whether diseases are infectious or non-communicable, any upward trends in disease in China are of disproportionate humanitarian concern in view of China's estimated 1\u00b735 billion population.",

The investigators use the extraordinary public health data system\u2014both hospital and clinic-based and sentinel surveillance\u2014of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) to characterise trends and prevalence for HIV from all 31 provinces. As with most Chinese national reports, the two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao, and Taiwan, are excluded. Although the systematic review of the published scientific literature is a valuable contribution, it is even more impressive that the authors (including leading China CDC epidemiologists) analysed prevalence trends between 1995 and 2010. 578 987 drug users, including 313 105 injecting drug users, were sampled from 295 national sentinel sites, along with 769 834 female sex workers (FSW) from 514 sites, and 87 255 men who have sex with men from 103 sites.10 Zhang and colleagues report that there is no one Asian pattern for HIV transmission. As elsewhere, geography, economics, and culture predict whether heterosexual, male homosexual, needle or syringe sharing to inject drugs, or contaminated blood, or blood products might be driving epidemic spread at any given time.11\n",

In China, HIV infection in injecting drug users has fallen, remained stable at low levels in FSWs (although higher in southwest China),12 and markedly increased in men who have sex with men. Cases among illegal blood donors have been eliminated, for all practical purposes, with the law enforcement crackdown on unscrupulous blood harvesters in the mid and late 1990s.13 This demographic shift is similar to other nations in the region, such as Thailand, and other large nations such as the USA, which have also had substantial changes in the subsets of vulnerable people who are disproportionately represented in recently incident cases. As in the USA since the grassroots distribution of clean needles and syringes (supported by the federal government for the first time in the Obama administration), China has seen the expansion of its needle and syringe exchange programmes and its methadone programmes associate with a marked fall in new HIV infections in injecting drug users.14, 15\n",

In an effort to organise communicable disease health care outside of crowded urban centres, HIV care is located in hospitals inconveniently located outside of cities. In an effort to ensure control of antiretroviral drugs given without cost in the Four Free and One Care policy of the government, drugs are only available in selected venues. These structural obstacles inhibit coverage that could increase treatment as prevention successes. Methadone is available widely, but is not decentralised; buprenorphine is used rarely for opiate substitution treatment.18 Condom use is inconsistent and sex work has re-emerged as a major exploitive commercial enterprise. However, the openness of the China CDC with their data, their willingness to debate areas needing improvement, and their commitment to improving and expanding much needed prevention programmes suggest that more progress will be made to reduce HIV incidence.",
