All epidemiological evidence to date suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection is less severe in children than in adults. In the latest and largest study in the UK, including 16,749 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, only 239 (2%) were <18 years of age (including 139 who were <5 years old) [5] . Large studies in Italy and China have also shown very low case-fatality rates in children and adolescents [6] . Understandably, most studies have focused on adult populations, with very few studies and reviews in children. Moreover, accumulating data points to risk factors for severity and mortality in adults (e.g. older age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, immunosuppression, obesity, tobacco smoking, etc) [5, 6] , but there is very scarce evidence on whether or which risk factors exist in children. While COVID-19 is a multi-system disease, it predominantly affects the lungs, and thus it is critically important to understand whether chronic lung diseases place children at higher risk.",

The review by Ludvigsson [13] included 45 studies from China (the total number of patients was not described) up to March 19, 2020. And Streng et al.

Instead, some of those studies reported young age (especially children <1 year of age) as a group with more severe COVID-19. One large Chinese study [15] reported non-respiratory chronic conditions (hydronephrosis, leukemia receiving chemotherapy, and intussusception) among the 3 children required ICU support and mechanical ventilation all had coexisting conditions; one death occurred in the 10-month child with intussusception. Another study reported a patient develop shock with metabolic acidosis requiring ICU [16] ; while a report from China[17] described one patient aged 10-19 years who died, without other clinical information, that probably is the same death in a 14-year-old boy described by Dong and colleagues [18] . Unfortunately, the two larger studies in Chinese pediatric patients, Dong et al. [18] (2,413 children) and Wu and MacGoogan [19] (965 children) did not report enough clinical data to identify comorbidities or risk factors for COVID-19 severity. In the German survey of 33 hospitalized children, 4 out of 22 (18%) children with clinical information had \"respiratory comorbidities\" without further details [14] .",

            "text": "Rather than a risk factor, a recent review of data in adults found it that both asthma and COPD appear to be under-represented in the comorbidities reported for patients with COVID-19, compared with global estimates of prevalence for these conditions in the general population. This was in contrast to the prevalence of other chronic diseases such as diabetes, which occurred with higher frequency among patients with COVID-19 than the estimated national prevalence [51] ; but consistent with several studies that have shown lower-than-expected prevalence of asthma among cases of COVID-19 [20] [21] [22] [23] 25] . If true, this could be due to several factors, including changes in the immune response or decreased risk secondary to chronic medications such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). In-vitro models have shown that ICS may suppress both coronavirus replication and cytokine production [52, 53] . And a recent study (in children and adults) showed that patients with asthma and respiratory allergies had reduced angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene expression in airway cells, suggesting a potential mechanism of reduced COVID- 19 risk[54] . This is particularly noteworthy considering that one of the potential explanations for children being generally less affected than adults is the hypothesis that children have lower ACE2 receptor expression in alveolar type 2 cells[55]. However, the lower prevalence of asthma among COVID-19 cases could also stem from bias due to underdiagnosis and under-reporting, or because patients with chronic lung diseases may be especially cautious in practicing physical distancing and other measures to avoid infection. Finally, it is also conceivable that some milder cases of COVID-19 might be confused with exacerbations of respiratory disease, and/or that these patients may be reluctant to seek medical care even when sick and are thus never counted.",

Are asthma medications (particularly ICS and systemic steroids) protective or detrimental?
