Donor quality is often cited as a reason for declining organs offered from donors infected with influenza, presumably due to concern about disease transmission at transplant leading to severe disease. We previously described an excellent outcome after heart transplant from a donor infected with influenza B that had been treated with a complete course of oseltamivir. In this report, we describe a similar outcome after transplantation of an organ from an influenza A-positive donor with symptomatic disease incompletely treated with oseltamivir. Due to the availability of effective antiviral treatment, we suggest that influenza A is also a manageable donor infection that need not preclude heart placement. radiograph demonstrated diffuse pulmonary interstitial markings consistent with pneumonitis or edema, and a bronchoscopy demonstrated purulent secretions with mixed gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, but no pathologic organisms were found.",

This reluctance does not extend to either cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus status as these are both common and, at least for cytomegalovirus, there is effective medical therapy. Organ donation from hepatitis C-positive donors to hepatitis C-negative recipients is increasingly utilized in adult transplantation due to the recent development of highly effective antiviral agents, which can then be used to treat the recipient. 5 Given the expanded repertoire of anti-infectious agents against viruses and other microorganisms, infections previously thought to render a donor heart unacceptable for transplantation are being reconsidered.",

There has been uncertainty in cases in which donors are positive for influenza as to need for and duration of therapy of both the donor and recipient. 9 In 2010, the American Society for Transplantation, The Transplantation Society, and Canadian Society of Transplantation endorsed recommendations that influenza-positive donors be considered for non-lymphoid solid organ transplant, and, while acknowledging inadequate supporting data, suggested a full course of antiviral therapy be used prior to organ procurement whenever possible. 11 It is also of note that the Center for Disease Control maintains updated information in regard to specific antiviral resistances reported, which may play a role in antiviral therapy choice. 12 However, in 2009, one United Kingdom group reported success with 13 solid organ transplants from H1N1-positive donors, of which three had not completed therapy, and only seven of the recipients received any antiviral therapy.",

Respiratory viral panels on our recipient were positive for coronavirus and rhino/enterovirus but negative for influenza on post-transplant days 5 and 10 and negative for all viruses on posttransplant day 15. He never developed symptoms of a respiratory infection and was discharged from the hospital on post-transplant day 15. His immunosuppression was not modified in response to his potential donor influenza exposure, including 1 day of solumedrol 10 mg/kg, 5 days of 1.5 mg/kg/dose thymoglobulin and solumedrol 3 mg/kg/d, 60 mg/kg/dose mycophenylate twice daily, and tacrolimus twice daily starting on post-transplant day 5 with a target range of 10-12. Additional immunosuppression consisted of 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin for a positive T-and B-cell crossmatch on post-operative day 1.",
