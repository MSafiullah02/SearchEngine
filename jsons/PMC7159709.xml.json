Continued improvement was seen, with resolution of all clinical signs 2 days after commencing the new treatment. After 5 days, the prednisolone dose rate was reduced to 0.5 mg/kg every 12 h and treatment with tramadol was discontinued. The antibiotic treatment was discontinued after a 7\u2010day course. After 1 week, the prednisolone dose rate was further reduced to 0.5 mg/kg every 24 h, which continued to control the clinical signs for an additional 7 days, at which point the lameness and reluctance to stand recurred. The prednisolone dose rate was increased to 0.5 mg/kg every 12 h, with a subsequent resolution of clinical signs. Over the following 6 weeks, repeated attempts to wean the prednisolone resulted in the recurrence of clinical signs. It was at this point, given the difficulty in controlling the clinical signs, that the puppy's owners elected euthanasia.",

The histopathology report for the puppy in case 1 included necrosis predominantly, with little active inflammation. The absence of inflammation was most likely related to both the timing of bone sampling being 2 months after the initial clinical signs, with the inflammation having progressed to necrosis, and to the anti\u2010inflammatory treatment.",
