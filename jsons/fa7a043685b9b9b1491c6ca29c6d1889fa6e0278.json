As for the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-II patients with stable cardiopulmonary function, on the basis of satisfying surgical operation, it is recommended to apply intravenous anesthesia without intubation combined with regional nerve block or caudal block anesthesia excluding stomach satiation, brain surgery, craniofacial, ear-nose-throat (ENT) surgery, cardiothoracic and laparoscopic surgery. Maintain patients' spontaneous breathing and oxygen inhalation by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with an airtight mask, then keep monitoring and prepare for intubation as soon as possible. As recommended, patients with a preoperative ASA class III and above or in severe cases are anesthetized with tracheal intubation, intravenous and inhalational technique combined with general anesthesia. Low flow closed air is required. Lung-protective ventilation should have lower tidal volume (3-8 mL/kg) and limited plateau pressure (below 30 cm H 2 O). 7 Intubation should be performed by an experienced anesthesiologist to ensure first-time success of intubation. In cases of difficult airway, the laryngeal mask should be placed after first failure for intubation to avoid the risk of infection caused by repeated attempts of intubation. 8 Proper removal of protective equipment is recommended under the guidance of infection control protection supervision. Protective clothing should be discarded in a double-folded, yellow, medical garbage bag and wrapped in designated area.",

The following necessary notes should be taken into consideration: (1) oxygen supply before induction: remove the medical protective masks or surgical mask while mask oxygen inhalation; (2) induction: there should be rapid induction of anesthesia and intubation, adequate muscle relaxation to prevent cough. Medication should be taken in the following order: midazolam, propofol/etomidate, rocuronium, fentanyl/sufentanil. Opioids should be injected slowly to avoid choking and coughing. Tracheal intubation should be performed after spontaneous breathing disappears and muscle relaxes completely; (3) before tracheal intubation, the anesthesiologist should wear an additional layer of rubber gloves; then remove them immediately after intubation is finished. A laryngoscope should be used for intubation. The disposable transparent laryngoscope sleeves should be discarded after use. For hand-held lens handles, a protective sleeve cover (specimen bag or sterile ultrasound probe cover, tightly sealed with a rubber band) should be used, the protective cover after use should be discarded and then repeatedly wiped and disinfected with hydrogen peroxide disinfection wipe or alcohol cotton; (4) judgment of catheter depth: the distance scale of the tube to the incisor, the degree of bilateral thorax undulation, the CO 2 waveform of the ventilator's expiration and the breathing parameters for comprehensive judgment should be observed. It is not easy to judge the depth of the catheter by auscultation of breathing sounds; (5) for patients with oral secretions, if without airway obstruction, it is recommended to perform airway aspiration after completing the tracheal intubation. Disable central suction, enable electric suction device, use closed suction system for tracheal suction to prevent secretion pollution.",

Before extubation, an appropriate amount of lidocaine is injected intravenously and mouth and nose are covered with two pieces of warm and moist gauze to avoid the discharge of secretions caused by choking. Indications for extubation are regular spontaneous respiration, tidal volume over 6 mL/kg and end-expiratory carbon dioxide partial pressure (PetCO 2 ) below 50 mm Hg.
