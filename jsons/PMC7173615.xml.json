The viral particle, referred to as virion, represents the static extracellular form without any metabolic activity, serving as a vehicle for the viral genetic material. The second, the dynamic form, consists of the viral genetic material itself once it is uncoated in a host cell. This active form of a virus uses the host cell biosynthesis machinery and energy supplies to multiply and to generate progeny virions. Hence, virus multiplication exploits host cells in a parasitic way. This results in the disturbance of normal cellular functions in many virus-infected cells, one of the basic mechanisms of viral diseases.",

Rabies virus, for example, binds to the acetylcholine receptor, and accordingly adsorbs to nerve cells. Human immunodeficiency virus adsorbs to CD4 molecules of T lymphocytes and macrophages, but needs co-receptors for viral entry into these cells. These co-receptors have been identified recently, and belong to the family of chemokine receptors. It should also be noted that carbohydrates have been shown to act as virus receptors.

Many of these differences stem from the dissociation of cells from a three-dimensional geometry and the lack of several systemic compounds involved in homeostatic regulation in vivo. As a consequence, cellular metabolism may not be truly representative of the tissue from which the cells were derived (see also below, \u2018Virus Propagation in Three-Dimensional Cell Culture Systems\u2019). Hepadnaviruses, for example, require liver-specific receptor(s) to enter their host cells. In cell culture, only primary liver cells fulfill this requirement. Continuous hepatoma cell lines, however, do not express these receptor(s) in culture and therefore prohibit hepadnavirus propagation in vitro.Most data on the hepadnavirus replication cycle have therefore been obtained by genetic approaches using transfection of terminally redundant hepadnavirus DNA constructs, directing the synthesis of the RNA pregenome, into cultured hepatoma cells. This method allows only a single round of virus production, and precludes the study of early steps of the viral replication cycle such as the uncoating of the viral genome and its conversion into covalently closed circular DNA. Recently, receptor(s) required for internalization of hepadnavirus particles have been identified and cloned. The availability of cloned receptor genes now will allow cultured hepatoma cells to be genetically engineered in order to induce constitutive expression of these molecule(s) on their surface.

Following cell division, infected daughter cells migrate from the basal region and begin the process of differentiation. Upon terminal differentiation, papillomavirus genome amplification, late gene expression and virion assembly are induced.\nHence, attempts to propagate papillomaviruses in conventional cell cultures, which do not allow the cells to terminally differentiate, have not been successful, but were facilitated by the utilization of three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures (also called organotypic cultures or raft cultures). In organotypic cultures, cells of different lineages are recombined in a 3D matrix in spatial relationships and in experimentally determined ratios to recreate a component of the organ under study. Organotypic cultures of epithelial cells, for example, recreate important features, both morphological and physiological, of epithelial differentiation in vitro by raising the cells to an air\u2013liquid interface, and even allow the achievement of terminal differentiation after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). When epithelial cells containing extrachromosomal papillomavirus genomes were grown in raft cultures, differentiation-dependent viral late gene expression, genome amplification and virion biosynthesis were observed.",

Each infectious particle will give rise to a focus of infected cells, which can be seen as an area of CPE.\nThe number of areas of CPE (plaques) within a cell monolayer can be easily counted after staining of the cell monolayer with a vital dye such as neutral red. Living cells stain red, and the areas of CPE appear as clear plaques against a red background (Fig. 1\n). From the number of plaques detected by this method, the number of infectious particles in a virus suspension can be calculated, and is expressed in terms of plaque-forming units (PFU) per milliliter.",

After infection of the cells, at the time when DNA amplification is maximal but before release of progeny virus, the monolayer is transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Cells attached to the membrane are subsequently lysed by alkali treatment, and the DNA (cellular and viral) is fixed to the membrane. A single cell that was infected and the viral DNA amplified, can be detected by autoradiography after hybridization of the filter-bound DNA with the corresponding radioactively labeled viral DNA (Fig. 1).
