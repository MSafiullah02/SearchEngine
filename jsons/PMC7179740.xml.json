The Viewpoint by Qu et al., entitled \u201cAn\nImperative Need for Research on the Role of Environmental Factors in\nTransmission of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)\u201d1 underscores the complexity of transmission routes of COVID-19.\nOf paramount concern is transmission from asymptomatic but infected caregivers via\nsecondhand aerosol (SHA) from e-cigarettes and secondhand smoke (SHS) from\ncombustible tobacco products to the most vulnerable groups\u2014individuals who\nare older and individuals with comorbidities.2 Moreover, while\nemerging evidence suggests younger children do not have as severe COVID-19 related\nhealth outcomes as older adults,3 children are another\nvulnerable group that may contract the virus and subsequently become vectors of\nCOVID-19, as they have high exposure rates to SHA and SHS.4\nSince older and younger populations may have limited mobility and independence,\nthey represent a group that may involuntarily become infected by their adult\ncaregivers who have now eschewed previously implemented smoking bans or increased\ntheir use of nicotine/tobacco products.",

This is because after\nSHA and SHS dissipates, thirdhand aerosol (THA) and thirdhand smoke (THS) settles\nin dust and on surfaces. Qu et al.\u2019s viewpoint highlights airborne dust as\na source to which coronaviruses can adsorb.1 Dust may contain\nTHS particles that are larger than coronaviruses (median diameter of 0.3\n\u03bcm).9 Thus, THA and THS may harbor COVID-19. There\nis evidence that coronaviruses can remain infectious for 9 days on inanimate\nsurfaces10 and this may also hold true in dust. Infants\nand toddlers are at risk for THA and THS exposure as they are in close bodily\ncontact with their caregivers and are actively exploring their environments. They\nmay touch, inhale, pick up, or ingest THA or THS-infected particles, become\ninfected, and subsequently infect older, at-risk family members.2 Older adults are at risk of direct exposure from the secondhand route of\ninhalation and from thirdhand routes of inhalation, dermal transfer, and\ningestion4 from dust and objects (e.g., wheelchairs)\nwhich harbor infected fomites. Thus, there is an urgent need to avoid all indoor\nvaping/smoking to (1) prevent viral spread via exhaled mainstream smoke on which\nCOVID-19 \u201chitches a ride\u201d and (2) protect vulnerable nonsmokers from\nexposure to COVID-infected SHA/SHS and THA/THS.",
