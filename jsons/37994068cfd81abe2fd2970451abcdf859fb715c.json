With an ongoing spread worldwide and increasing mortality, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern as per the World Health Organization. 1 As of April 24 th , the total number of reported cases of COVID -19 globally has been 2.79 million of which 923, 000 have been in the United States. The clinical presentation of this disease is mostly pulmonary, with computed tomography of chest contributing to the diagnosis and facilitating the staging and severity of the disease. 2, 3 Reports of cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 infection are on the rise 4, 5 . In this review, we discuss the various cardiovascular manifestations of this disease. We have aimed to discuss in detail the pathophysiology, cardiovascular manifestations of the infection, and a concise review of articles published with data from the present pandemic.",

ACE 2 is also expressed in alveolar epithelial cell type I, II in the lung resulting in the predominant pulmonary manifestations. Similarly, higher ACE 2 gene expression has been reported in patients ofEast Asianethnicity and smokers. Whether that makes them more susceptible is yet unknown. [10] [11] [12] [13] In the heart, ACE 2is predominantly located in cardiac endothelium, cardiac myocytes, and smooth muscle cells of the myocardial vessels. Even though ACE 2 is highly expressed in the heart, the exact mechanism of cardiac injury is not yet completely understood. 14 Two distinct processes of acute cardiac injury that have been discussed so far in COVID-19 are non-ischemic myocardial injury and myocardial ischemia. 6 6, 14, 17 Ischemic injury though postulated, has not been supported by evidence yet. Systemic inflammation, inflammation-induced prothrombotic state and increased shear stress following increased coronary blood flow has been postulated to precipitate plaque rupture causing features of acute coronary syndrome. 6, 14 Other cardiovascular mechanisms that have also been thought to cause poor outcomes are dyselectrolytemia (such as hypokalemia) and cardiac medications acting on the Renin -Angiotensin-Aldosterone axis ( such as angiotensin receptor blockers), other drugs including statins,various antiviral agents, steroids, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin 6, 18, 19 . However, these reports are anecdotal and lack a robust basic-science basis to be used as clinical evidence at present. Figure 1 represents the 3 principal factors contributing to cardiac injury in patients with COVID -19. Older patients can have multiple contributors to cardiac injury as shown in the image, predisposing them to a higher risk of the poorer outcome.",

However, Wu et al in their study did not find this trend or appearance of a new pericardial effusion at follow up imaging done within 6 days. 22 Another study reported around 4-5% of patients with pericardial effusion. In this study Li et al reported that the presence of pericardial effusion was significantly higher among patients with severe disease, indicating the presence of significantly higher inflammation. 3, 24 .

Cardiovascular risk factors in terms of DM, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke was present in 35.5%, 30%, 24.5%, and 9.6% respectively in a subset of patients who succumbed to the disease. Advanced age was associated with higher mortality in this study with a reported case fatality of 12.8 % and 20.2% in patients above the age group of 70 and,80 respectively. 15 Across all studies, cardiovascular risk factors like advanced age, hypertension, DM, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease have been reported to be associated with increased mortality. As shown in figure 2, these factors have been independently linked with higher disease severity, multi-organ failure, requirement of invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation, presence of cardiac injury, and mortality. 4, 8, 14, 15, 17, 21 Treatment Most treatment has been supportive. Various agents including antivirals, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, IL-6 receptor antagonist, and multiple other agents have been postulated as potential therapies. 1, 6, 14 The mortality benefit of these agents is yet to be established in clinical trials. Reported outcomes following the administration of corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin are inconsistent. Concerns over the continuation of statins, angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors in patients with prior cardiac comorbidities await vetting from further clinical evidence. 18 In the meanwhile, concerns deepen over QTC prolongation and risk of cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin for treatment. 16 ",
