            "text": "The observed functional behavior of a wide variety large-scale system is often the result of a network of pairwise interactions. However, in many cases, these interactions are hidden from us, either because they are impossible to measure directly, or because their measurement can be done only at significant experimental cost. Examples include the mechanisms of gene and metabolic regulation [1], brain connectivity [2], the spread of epidemics [3], systemic risk in financial institutions [4], and influence in social media [5]. In such situations, we are required to infer the network of interactions from the observed functional behavior. Researchers have approached this reconstruction task from a variety of angles, resulting in many different methods, including thresholding the correlation between time series [6], inversion of deterministic dynamics [7\u20139], statistical inference of graphical models [10\u201314] and of models of epidemic spreading [15\u201320], as well as approaches that avoid explicit modeling, such as those based on transfer entropy [21], Granger causality [22], compressed sensing [23\u201325], generalized linearization [26], and matching of pairwise correlations [27,28].",

First, we employ a nonparametric Bayesian formulation of the problem, which yields a full posterior distribution of possible networks that are compatible with the observed dynamical behavior. Second, we perform network reconstruction jointly with community detection [29], where, at the same time as we infer the edges of the underlying network, we also infer its modular structure [30]. As we will show, while network reconstruction and community detection are desirable goals on their own, joining these two tasks has a synergistic effect, whereby the detection of communities significantly increases the accuracy of the reconstruction, which in turn improves the discovery of the communities, when compared to performing these tasks in isolation.",

However, neither of these approaches attempt to perform network reconstruction together with community detection. Furthermore, they are tied down to one particular inverse problem, and as we will show, our general approach can be easily extended to an open-ended variety of functional models.",

We can unite reconstruction with community detection via an, at first, seemingly minor, but ultimately consequential modification of the above equation where we introduce a structured prior P(A|b) where b represents the partition of the network in communities, i.e., b={bi}, where bi\u2208{1,\u2026,B} is group membership of node i. This partition is unknown, and is inferred together with the network itself, via the joint posterior distribution P(A,b|D)=P(D|A)P(A|b)P(b)P(D).(2)The prior P(A|b) is an assumed generative model for the network structure. In our work, we will use the degree-corrected stochastic block model (DC-SBM) [35], which assumes that, besides differences in degree, nodes belonging to the same group have statistically equivalent connection patterns, according to the joint probability P(A|\u03bb,\u03ba,b)=\u220fi<je-\u03bai\u03baj\u03bbbi,bj(\u03bai\u03baj\u03bbbi,bj)AijAij!,(3)with \u03bbrs determining the average number of edges between groups r and s and \u03bai the average degree of node i. The marginal prior is obtained by integrating over all remaining parameters weighted by their respective prior distributions, P(A|b)=\u222bP(A|\u03bb,\u03ba,b)P(\u03ba|b)P(\u03bb|b)d\u03bad\u03bb,(4)which can be computed exactly for standard prior choices, although it can be modified to include hierarchical priors that have an improved explanatory power [36] (see Supplemental Material [37] for a concise summary.).",

The latent conditional probabilities of edges existing between groups of nodes is learned by the collective observation of many similar edges, and these correlations are leveraged to extrapolate the existence of missing or spurious ones. The same mechanism is expected to aid the reconstruction task, where edges are not observed directly, but the observed functional behavior yields a posterior distribution on them, allowing the same kind of correlations to be used as an additional source of evidence for the reconstruction, going beyond what the dynamics alone says.",

The first comes from a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic spreading model [40], where \u03c3i(t)=1 means node i is infected at time t, 0, otherwise. The likelihood for this model is P(\u03c3|A,\u03c4,\u03b3)=\u220ft\u220fiP(\u03c3i(t)|\u03c3(t-1)),(5)where P(\u03c3i(t)|\u03c3(t-1))=f(emi(t-1),\u03c3i(t))1-\u03c3i(t-1)\u00d7f(\u03b3,\u03c3i(t))\u03c3i(t-1)(6)is the transition probability for node i at time t, with f(p,\u03c3)=(1-p)\u03c3p1-\u03c3, and where mi(t)=\u2211jAijln(1-\u03c4ij)\u03c3j(t) is the contribution from all neighbors of node i to its infection probability at time t. In the equations above, the value \u03c4ij is the probability of an infection via an existing edge (i,j), and \u03b3 is the 1\u21920 recovery probability. With these additional parameters, the full posterior distribution for the reconstruction becomes P(A,b,\u03c4|\u03c3)=P(\u03c3|A,\u03c4,\u03b3)P(A|b)P(b)P(\u03c4)P(\u03c3|\u03b3).(7)Since \u03c4ij\u2208[0,1], we use the uniform prior P(\u03c4)=1. Note, also, that the recovery probability \u03b3 plays no role on the reconstruction algorithm, since its term in the likelihood does not involve A [and, hence, gets cancelled out in the denominator P(\u03c3|\u03b3)=P(\u03b3|\u03c3)P(\u03c3)/P(\u03b3)]. This means that the above posterior only depends on the infection events 0\u21921 and, thus, is also valid without any modifications to all epidemic variants susceptible-infected (SI), susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR), susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR), etc., [40], since the infection events occur with the same probability for all these models.",

Therefore, instead, we make use of the pseudolikelihood approximation [41], which is very accurate for the purpose at hand [14], where we approximate Eq.

The detectability threshold for this model is given by \u03b5*=1/\u27e8k\u27e9, below which it is impossible to recover the planted community structure [44]. Given a network A* from this model, we sample M independent Ising microstates s according to Eq. (8) using Jij=1, hi=0, and \u03b2=\u03b2* being the critical inverse temperature for the particular network. We compare two inference approaches: In the first, we sample both the reconstructed network as well as its community structure form the joint posterior of Eq. (10). In the second approach, we perform reconstruction and community detection separately, by first performing reconstruction in isolation, by replacing the DC-SBM prior P(A|b) by the likelihood of an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model. We evaluate the quality of the reconstruction via the posterior similarity S\u2208[0,1], defined as S(A*,\u03c0)=1-\u2211i<j|Aij*-\u03c0ij|\u2211i<j|Aij*+\u03c0ij|,(11)where A* is the true network and \u03c0 is the marginal posterior probability for each edge, i.e., \u03c0ij=\u2211A,b,\u03b8AijP(A,b,\u03b8|D). A value S=1 means perfect reconstruction. We then perform community detection a posteriori by obtaining the maximum marginal point estimate A^ij={1if  \u03c0ij>1/2,0if  \u03c0ij<1/2.,(12)and then sampling from the posterior P(b|A^). Figure 1 contains the comparison between both approaches for networks sampled from the PP model, which shows how sampling from the joint posterior improves both the reconstruction as well as community detection. For the latter, the joint inference allows the detection all the way down to the detectability threshold, for the examples considered, which, otherwise, is not possible with the separate method.",

            "text": "Real networks with synthetic dynamics.\u2014Now, we investigate the reconstruction of networks not generated by the DC-SBM. We take two empirical networks, the worldwide network of N=3286 airports [45] with E=39430 edges, and a food web from Little Rock Lake [46], containing N=183 nodes and E=2434 edges, and we sample from the SIS (mimicking the spread of a pandemic) and Ising model (representing simplified interspecies interactions) on them, respectively, and evaluate the reconstruction obtained via the joint and separate inference with community detection, with results shown in Fig. 2. As is also the case for synthetic networks, the reconstruction quality is significantly improved by performing joint community detection [47]. The quality of the reconstruction peaks at the critical threshold for each model, at which the sensitivity to perturbations is the largest. As the number of observed samples increases, so does the quality of the reconstruction, and the relative advantage of the joint reconstruction diminishes, as the data eventually \u201cwashes out\u201d the contribution from the prior. For the Ising model, we compare the results of our method with the mean-field inverse correlations method [14], i.e., \u03b2AijJij=[C-1]ij, where Cij=\u27e8\u03c3i\u03c3j\u27e9-\u27e8\u03c3i\u27e9\u27e8\u03c3j\u27e9 is the connected correlation matrix. As seen in Fig. 2, this simpler reconstruction method can be just as accurate as our separate reconstruction approach, but only close to the critical point. For higher inverse temperatures, the reconstruction deteriorates rapidly and breaks down completely as the system becomes locally magnetized, with whole rows and columns of the matrix C being equal to zero, causing it to be singular [48]. In such situations, this kind of approach requires explicit regularization techniques [49], which become unnecessary with our Bayesian method. The joint inference with community structure improves the reconstruction even further, beyond what is obtainable with typical inverse Ising methods, since it incorporates a different source of evidence.",

The first example is the sequence of M=619 votes of N=575 deputies in the 2007 to 2011 session of the lower chamber of the Brazilian congress. Each deputy voted yes, no, or abstained for each legislation, which we represent as {1,-1,0}, respectively. Since the temporal ordering of the voting sessions is likely to be of secondary importance to the voting outcomes, we assume the votes are sampled from an Ising model [the addition of zero-valued spins changes Eq. (9) only slightly by replacing 2cosh(x)\u21921+2cosh(x)]. Figure 4 shows the result of the reconstruction, where the division of the nodes uncovers a cohesive government and a split opposition, as well as a marginal center group, which correlates very well with the known party memberships and can be used to predict unseen voting behavior (see Supplemental Material [37] for more details). In Fig. 5, we show the result of the reconstruction of the directed network of influence between N=1833 twitter users from 58224 retweets [50] using a SI epidemic model (the act of \u201cretweeting\u201d is modeled as an infection event, using Eqs. (5) and (6) with \u03b3=0) and the nested DC-SBM. The reconstruction uncovers isolated groups with varying propensities to retweet, as well as groups that tend to influence a large fraction of users. By inspecting the geolocation metadata on the users, we see that the inferred groups amount, to a large extent, to different countries, although clear subdivisions indicate that this is not the only factor governing the influence among users (see Supplemental Material [37] for more details).",

The method is nonparametric and, hence, requires no prior stipulation of aspects of the network and size of the model, such as number of groups. By leveraging inferred correlations between edges, the SBM includes an additional source of evidence and, thereby, improves the reconstruction accuracy, which in turn also increases the accuracy of the inferred communities. The overall approach is general, requiring only appropriate functional model specifications, and can be coupled with an open ended variety of such models other than those considered here.",
