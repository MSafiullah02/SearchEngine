During September 2012 to October 2013, 77 travellers from the Middle East who met the possible case definition for MERS were tested in England and two of them tested positive for MERS-CoV.11 Also, 22 had positive results for alternative respiratory pathogens, including 10 (13%) cases of influenza A or B and four (5%) cases of rhinovirus.9 UK surveillance data focusing on the period of return of Hajj pilgrims during the years 2013\u20132015 (September\u2013October) evidenced influenza infection in 46% and rhinovirus in 30% of 50 patients suspected of MERS (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-report-volume-9-2015/hpr-volume-9-issue-36-news-9-october). Of the first 14 patients returning from the Middle East who were hospitalized for respiratory symptoms and screened for MERS-CoV in Marseille, France in October 2013, nine (64%) were infected with influenza and all samples tested negative for MERS-CoV.12 In another small survey conducted in 2014 in Austria and investigating seven Hajj pilgrims suspected of MERS, none had MERS-CoV, five had influenza, and two were infected by rhinovirus.13 A survey conducted among 177 travellers from the Middle East suspected of MERS on returning to Ontario, Canada in 2012\u20132014, showed that none tested positive for MERS-CoV, 41 (23%) were positive for influenza, and 35 (20%) for rhinovirus.14 Finally, in a survey conducted in 2013\u20132014 in California, USA among 52 patients suspected of MERS, none was positive for MERS, 17 (33%) were positive for influenza, and seven (13%) for rhinovirus.15 Other pathogens were isolated in smaller proportions, including parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, adenovirus, non-MERS coronaviruses, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella spp.11, 12, 13, 14, 15\n",

However, a microbial cause is not identified in a significant proportion of patients with a respiratory infection, which makes the overall incidence of influenza very low. Empirical antiviral treatment for influenza on admission when indicated may be considered pending the results of laboratory investigations, although oseltamivir resistance among influenza strains has been reported. Influenza vaccination should be a priority for all Hajj pilgrims, as recommended by experts.27, 28 However, since Hajj dates are now moving to the summer season, the lack of availability of the influenza vaccine in many countries during this period will hamper this strategy. Public health measures introduced by Saudi Arabia in 2015, banning the sacrifice of camels for Hajj and discouraging visits by pilgrims to camel barns during Hajj pilgrimage activities, are sensible precautionary measures that should be considered as part of pre-travel advice in the home countries of pilgrims.",

The recent experience in South Korea, with a single chain of transmission associated with healthcare facilities resulting in many cases, is a reminder that enhanced surveillance at ports of entry is critical. The few pilgrimage-associated cases of MERS in travellers reported so far were in Umrah pilgrims.7 An estimated eight million pilgrims perform the Umrah yearly.29 The number of Umrah pilgrims is particularly high during the month of Ramadan, and that period could be considered the second mass gathering in Saudi Arabia, although of a lesser size compared to the Hajj. Studies on respiratory tract infections during Ramadan are scarce; thus continued surveillance of respiratory infections and of the spectrum of associated pathogens among pilgrims returning from the Umrah during Ramadan and from the subsequent Hajj is of critical importance.",
