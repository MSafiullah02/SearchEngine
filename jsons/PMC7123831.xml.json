Children younger than 3 years of age may have an atypical presentation of GABHS infection called streptococcosis, which is characterized by fever, mucopurulent or serous rhinitis, and adenopathy, followed by irritability, loss of appetite and lethargy. Exudative tonsillitis is rare in this age group. On physical exam, it is often difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial tonsillitis, but some clinical findings may provide important clues of the etiologic agent.

Furthermore, with a few rare exceptions (e.g. Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium spp.) anti-microbial treatment is not beneficial for bacterial causes of tonsillitis except GABHS given that there is not a significant reduction in the rate of complications or in duration of clinical symptoms [7]. Seventy percent of patients presenting with sore throat are treated with antibiotics while only 20\u201330 % have documented GABHS tonsillitis. Antibiotic treatment may be associated with adverse drug events that range from mild diarrhea to severe allergic reactions. Thus, the utility of these drugs must be determined in order to avoid potential selection of resistant organisms, exposure to adverse events associated with anti-microbial use, and extra cost. Treatment of GABHS is instrumental in preventing the potentially long-term and life-threatening complications associated with this pathogen, specifically and most importantly, ARF. Treatment also aids in the control of acute signs and symptoms, prevention of suppurative complications, and decreased transmission of GABHS to close contacts [7]. Throat pain and fever self-resolve by 1 week and 3\u20135 days, respectively, after onset if left untreated; if treated, both symptoms resolve within 3 days [15]. The organisms are eradicated from the pharynx after 10 days of treatment. ARF can be prevented even if therapy is initiated after 9 days of onset [11]. Of note, treatment does not prevent the development of PSGN [7].",

Children in this age group do not present with classic symptoms of GABHS tonsillitis and the incidence of ARF is rare, affecting approximately 0.2 % of children [7, 9]. Testing for GABHS in these children should only be pursued in the presence of other risk factors such as school-aged sibling with documented infection by GABHS, close household contact with diagnosis of symptomatic disease, or with personal or family history of a GABHS complication (ARF) [7].",

This test is done via throat swab of the surface of either tonsil or tonsillar fossa and posterior pharyngeal wall. Swabs of other areas of the oropharynx or oral cavity may lead to false negatives. An enzyme immunoassay test with turn-around times as little as 5 min is then done. It is 95 % specific and 70\u201390 % sensitive based on the type or manufacturer of RADT used. In the case of a positive RADT, children should be treated with antibiotics. In the case of a negative RADT, the IDSA recommends a throat culture be done during the same office visit. Due to the variability in sensitivity of RDTA based on manufacturer, the high rate of GABHS in children and implications of complications, a throat culture is recommended in order to capture any false negatives. The rapid turnaround time for RADT makes it useful for rapid identification and treatment of GABHS. Rapid treatment decreases the risk of spread of GABHS among close contacts, the amount of time missed from school or work for caregivers, and the duration and severity of acute signs and symptoms of GABHS tonsillitis [7].",

A single throat swab has a 90\u201395 % sensitivity rate when done correctly. A throat swab similar to the RADT test is done and is then either processed in an in-office laboratory or sent to a microbiology laboratory. If the cultures are grown in-office, specific instructions must be followed. The swab is processed on a sheep\u2019s blood agar plate and incubated at 35\u201337 \u00b0C for 18\u201324 h. While treatment decisions can be made based on growth patterns at 24 h, a plate with no growth should be re-examined at 48 h to ensure a correct diagnosis. Two major disadvantages of using throat cultures for diagnostic purposes are the training and cost associated with accurate testing as well as delayed diagnosis due to processing time. However, even a delayed diagnosis can be beneficial. Studies show that treatment of GABHS tonsillitis can be delayed up to 9 days from the onset of symptoms and still effectively prevent complications such as ARF [7, 16, 17]. Therefore, regardless of the delay in treatment, throat cultures should be done in children with negative RADT [7].",

Distinguishing chronic carriers from recurrent acutely infected children is not possible with the current diagnostic modalities, chronic carriers of GABHS are unlikely to spread bacteria to close contacts and they are at minimal to no risk of developing complications of GABHS [7]. Moreover, eradication of GABHS from colonized tonsils and adenoids is much more difficult than treatment of acute GABHS tonsillitis.

While tonsillectomy is generally recommended after the resolution of infection, it can be considered at the time of infection in a select few cases. Indications include peritonsillar abscess in younger children; recurrent or unresponsive cases of peritonsillar abscess or in the setting of previous history of deep neck abscess, and peritonsillar abscess presenting with severe airway compromise [42]. Due to the inflammation in an infected field, the risk of intraoperative, and potentially post-operative, bleeding is increased. Thus, candidates for Quinsy tonsillectomy must be carefully and selectively chosen.",
