            "text": "Our laboratory has developed and validated a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction 1, 2 (ddPCR) method to detect SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus/2019-nCoV) nucleic acids in human sputum specimens that is more than order of magnitude more sensitive than real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) 3 , which is the current gold standard for clinical evaluation of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. This method is a quantitative endpoint assay in which RNA extracted from human sputum is reverse transcribed before the resulting cDNA is added as template to a PCR mix. The 20 \u00b5L PCR is then partitioned into ~20,000 1-nL droplets in an oil emulsion before target sequences are amplified, with each droplet that passes a size filter being analyzed for fluorescence intensity in two channels after 40 cycles of amplification. After reading the droplets, thresholds are applied to the fluorescence intensities of those two channels to discriminate between positive (target amplified) and negative (no target amplified) droplets, and the resulting concentration of target sequence, in copies/\u00b5L, can be calculated based on the number of positive and negative droplets in each reaction. Partitioning is critical for detection of low-abundance targets and reduces the ability of inhibitors to negatively impact amplification 4 . This methodology enables far more sensitive detection 5 of SARS-CoV-2, particularly for early diagnosis in infected individuals who will become symptomatic and for asymptomatic individuals with low viral loads that may be missed by rRT-PCR tests. The QX200 ddPCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) has been, in our experience, a reliable and robust platform for automated droplet generation and droplet reading (autoDG and QX200, respectively). The method we describe here utilizes commercially available reagents and kits for both reverse transcription and ddPCR. Automated RNA extraction from human sputum samples was performed with simplyRNA from Tissue kits in a Maxwell\u00ae RSC (both from Promega, Madison, WI). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse transcribed from RNA extracts using SuperScript\u2122 IV VILO\u2122 Master Mix (Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). The PCR primer/probe sequences for both SARS-CoV-2 (N1 region of the nucleocapsid gene) and human RNase P/RPP30 (RP) have been previously published by the United States Department of Health and Human Services 6 ; the N1 probe is conjugated to FAM reporter and BHQ-1 quencher, whereas the RP probe is conjugated to HEX reporter and BHQ-1 quencher (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA was a generously supplied by the UTMB World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (Galveston, TX).",

Lysis Buffer (200 \u00b5L) was added to each homogenate and the capped tubes were again vortexed vigorously for 30 seconds. The entire volume of lysate was transferred with a wide-bore pipette tip to the simplyRNA cartridges, which were prepared as described in the user manual and processed with the Maxwell RSC according to the simplyRNA Tissue method uploaded to the instrument. Purified RNA was eluted in 50 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water (water and 0.6 mL elution tubes provided in the kit). Typical RNA yield was in the 25-500 ng/\u00b5L range. Spike-in experiments for the creation of \"contrived\" (synthetic) positives was performed with purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA from an appropriate substock, as we empirically determined the concentration of the 100 ng/\u00b5L stock provided by UTMB WRCEVA to be ~8.0 x 10 8 copies/\u00b5L. We performed serial 10-fold dilutions in low TE (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA) buffer and added purified viral RNA to non-reactive RNA extracts such that the spike volume did not exceed 10% of the total final volume of the contrived positive samples. Naked, purified viral RNA added to human sputum before extraction, even in the presence of 1-thioglycerol and kept on ice, could not be detectably recovered presumably due to rapid degradation by RNases in the specimens.",

The ddPCR reaction mix was then maintained on ice until cDNA synthesis was completed. From this point on, ddPCR plate set-up was performed in a tissue culture hood, on ice, to minimize dust contamination. 15.0 \u00b5L of the ddPCR reaction mix was added to the appropriate wells of a fresh 96-well ddPCR plate, and 5.0 \u00b5L of cDNA was added to the wells designated on a plate map.

Sufficient fresh, unused cartridges were loaded to accommodate the number of plate columns selected during configuration, and enough filter tips were present such that for each column on the sample plate there were TWO columns of tips. The sealed donor plate was placed carefully but securely in the clips on the donor plate platform inside the autoDG. A cold chill block (stored at -20\u00b0C, purple side down) was placed in the autoDG with the \"cyclops\" eye on the bottom and toward the back of the autoDG using the alignment stubs located on the platform. A fresh, unused 96-well ddPCR plate (\"acceptor plate\") was placed securely on the cold chill block in the autoDG in the same orientation as the donor plate. Droplet generation was initiated after ensuring all components were present and sufficient for the run. After droplet generation was completed, the acceptor plate was sealed with a fresh, unused plate seal and visually inspected to ensure uniformity of the milky emulsion layer across all wells containing samples/controls/Buffer Controls. After generation, droplets were particularly fragile and care was taken to handle the sealed acceptor plate gently; thermal cycling was initiated within 45 minutes of completing droplet generation as recommended by the manufacturer.

The plate was then allowed to equilibrate to ambient temperature for 5 minutes. The droplet reader as turned on and the QuantaSoft program was opened on the computer linked to the droplet reader. NOTE: NO PRIMING, FLUSHES OR DECONTAMINATION WERE REQUIRED. However, if the droplet reader was inactive for more than 3 days, a prime was performed to maintain consistent droplet reading results, especially in well A1 of the ddPCR plate. The droplet reader plate chamber was opened, the ddPCR plate was loaded and the chamber was closed. The droplet reader template was configured according to the PLATE MAP used for donor plate set up (double click in at least one cell, e.g. A1). Sample identifiers were added for all wells containing samples or controls (for example, \"S1\", \"NTC\", \"PC\"). Under the \"EXPERIMENT\" dropdown menu, \"ABS\" was selected. In the \"SUPERMIX\" dropdown menu, \"ddPCR Supermix for probes <no dUTP>\" was selected. For Target 1, \"N1\" was entered in the \"Name\" box and the appropriate sample type was selected (\"Ch1 Unknown\", \"Ch1 Positive\", \"NTC\" as appropriate). For Target 2, \"RP\" was entered in the \"Name\" box and the appropriate sample type was selected (\"Ch2 Unknown\", \"Ch2 Positive\", \"NTC\" as appropriate). \"Apply\" (blue text) must be clicked to save those selections in the desired wells.

The true LOD for this method is quite likely below 0.25 copies/\u00b5L as we were able to detect reactivity in 2 of 2 contrived positives spiked at 2 copies/\u00b5L in the RNA extract, but unable to detect reactivity in a contrived positive spiked at 1 copy/\u00b5L. All contrived positive samples containing at least 4 copies/\u00b5L of purified viral RNA in the total RNA extract demonstrated reactivity in a clinical evaluation analysis (at least 20 contrived positives at 1x-2x LOD as defined by EUA guidance), with 2 of 3 contrived positives below LLOQ yielding positive droplets. In silico analysis of the N1 and RP primer/probe sequences, along with wet testing of plasmid-borne SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV nucleocapsid gene sequences during method development, reveal 100% inclusivity of known annotated SAS-CoV-2 genomes and no crossreactivity of common and related respiratory pathogens.
