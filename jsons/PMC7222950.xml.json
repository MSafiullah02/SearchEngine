            "text": "Each year approximately 2.5 Mio. people visit the emergency department for traumatic brain injury (TBI), leading to over 280,000 hospitalizations and 56,000 deaths [1]. In cases of severe TBI with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), evaluation and management may involve the insertion of invasive intracranial devices such as an intracranial pressure monitor (ICPM), which can serve to monitor the ICP alone and/or therapeutically drain the cerebral spinal fluid (e.g. external ventricular drain) [2]. Despite the ability to monitor and adjust treatment based on the ICPM, use of these devices has not been shown to improve mortality in multiple previous studies [2\u20134]. One study found no benefit in the use of an ICPM compared to clinical examination plus imaging in patients without an ICPM [5]. Both the Brain Trauma Foundation and American College of Surgeons (ACS) Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) guidelines recommend the use of ICPMs for patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) \u2264 8 and an abnormal computed tomography (CT) scan. The ACS TQIP guidelines recommend the use of the modified Berne-Northwood criteria to determine the optimal timing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemoprophylaxis (CP) in the setting of ICPMs. This criteria takes into consideration the stability of a patient\u2019s CT scan as well as risk factors for hemorrhage [6]. For patients with severe TBI but a stable head CT scan, the recommendation is to start VTE CP within 24\u201372 h, whereas there remains ambiguity towards this timing when an ICPM is used as not all physicians are mandated to follow ACS TQIP guidelines.",

            "text": "Severe TBI increases the risk for VTE as a result of inappropriate thrombosis caused by the systemic release of tissue factor from brain parenchyma, hypercoagulability, and prolonged immobilization [7]. However, VTE CP is sometimes delayed or avoided in patients with ICPM due to physician discretion in balancing the risk of postprocedural hemorrhage with possible VTE events [8]. A recent single-center analysis concluded that VTE CP did not pose a significant bleeding risk in patients following ICPM implementation, but there is still no accepted standard for its optimal use or timing [8]. The rate of VTE in TBI patients with an ICPM is reported to be up to 25% despite receiving mechanical prophylaxis (compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression and venous pumps), and can be up to 50% in patients without mechanical prophylactic measures [10, 11]. In contrast, a systematic review of the literature on VTE CP in TBI patients revealed no significant difference in VTE events for individuals who received early (< 3 days) versus late (> 3 days) CP [12]. However, other studies have shown that delayed initiation of VTE CP is associated with increased risk of VTE events [13\u201315]. We hypothesized that patients with severe TBI and ICPMs would have delayed the initiation of VTE CP and, therefore, increased risk of VTE compared to those without an ICPM.",

This was defined by an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) grade > 3 for the head. Those that died within 24-h or that had non-survivable TBI (AIS head grade = 6) were excluded. Patients with ICPMs were compared to those without ICPMs. The four types of ICPMs included within the TQIP database are: (1) Intraparenchymal oxygen monitor (e.g. Licox), (2) intraparenchymal pressure monitor (e.g. Camino bolt, subarachnoid bolt, intraparenchymal catheter), (3) intraventricular drain/catheter (e.g. ventriculostomy, external ventricular drain) and (4) jugular venous bulb. Our primary end-point of interest was the development of VTE including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Other measured outcomes include the total hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, ventilator days, acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and mortality. The number of trauma surgeons and neurosurgeons per center as well as packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions within 24 h were also recorded. In addition, we determined which patients were started with VTE CP and how many days after admission this was initiated. VTE CP included either unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH).",

Even when delaying CP > 7 days, the study by Kwiatt et al. demonstrated substantial risk of intracranial hemorrhage progression in up to 14.9% of patients, demonstrating that the risk of progression may be independent of when CP is initiated [13]. Conversely, more recent reports including a systematic review by Jamjoom et al. of randomized trials and cohort studies demonstrated that when early CP < 72 h was performed, no increase in progression of intracranial hemorrhage was seen along with a decrease in VTE events compared to late CP [14]. The Neurocritical Care Society suggests that an ideal start time for VTE CP is sometime less than 72 h after a hemorrhage, but admits that the existing literature is limited with no definitive guidelines [15]. One study recommends initiating prophylaxis 24 h after a stable intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), but this study is limited by a small sample size, and remaining studies that recommend starting up to 4 days after a stable ICH are limited by lack of randomization or a comparator group [15, 17]. Therefore, we performed a post hoc analysis starting at five days after injury to see if delays beyond this conservative initiation point were associated with increased risk of VTE. Our study demonstrated that ICPMs are associated with longer delay to CP initiation leading to increased VTE. Those with ICPMs had a delayed start time for VTE CP by an entire day. We found that even a single day of delayed VTE CP led to an increased risk of VTE. Our findings add to the current literature that delayed initiation of VTE CP leads to increased incidence of VTE. We demonstrated that ICPM use can influence the timing of starting the CP in a way that ultimately leads to increased occurrence of VTE. In addition, our subgroup analysis of patients with isolated TBI revealed an even higher association between ICPM placement and VTE regardless of chemoprophylaxis timing. We thus believe that the increased risk of VTE should be considered when deciding on the ICPM placement. In addition, our findings highlight the need for future research and the development of consensus guidelines regarding the timing of initiation of VTE CP in the setting of ICPM use.",

Retrospective studies by Kosti\u0107 et al. and Shafi et al. had a combined total of 2031 patients and both reported no significant improvement in mortality with ICPM use [2, 9]. Furthermore, the benchmark evidence from the South American trials: treatment of intracranial pressure, a randomized prospective multicenter study, found that ICP monitoring with a goal < 20 mm Hg to have no benefit in terms of mortality compared to treatment based on clinical examination and imaging [5]. They also found no significant difference in functional and cognitive status or 6-month mortality. Our study not only revealed no mortality benefit, but also demonstrated an overall increased mortality for those with ICPMs. However, after adjusting for demographics, injury severity, condition on arrival, and comorbidities, patients with ICPM had a similar associated risk of mortality compared to patients without ICP monitors. We found that those with ICPMs also had higher rates of complications such as AKI, ARDS, and VTE. That said, caution regarding these findings is necessary as patients with ICPM were older and had higher injury severity scores; thus, the difference in mortality may be related to these factors and not the placement of an ICPM. Regardless, the lack of mortality benefit evidenced by our study and several others coupled with the increased rates for complications should be taken into consideration when deciding to place an ICPM. Our findings support the need for a well-designed, large multicenter randomized controlled trial that addresses not only the potential benefits of ICPM use but also the potential complications associated with its use such as VTE and mortality.",

In the prospective randomized clinical trial conducted by Geerts et al., the LMWH, enoxaparin at a dose of 30 millig twice daily, was compared to 5,000 units of UFH every 12 h rather than the accepted dosage schedule of every 8 h [18]. This fueled discussion and disagreement on the use of LMWH versus UFH in trauma patients due to the inaccuracy of the dosage studied. This dispute was addressed in a large retrospective analysis of over 18,000 patients conducted by Jacobs et al., which found that as compared to UFH, LMWH was associated with decreased risk of mortality, VTE, PE, and DVT when accounting for risk adjustments [19]. Another study by Benjamin et al. of over 20,000 patients concluded that LMWH was an independent protective factor against mortality and VTE regardless of VTE chemoprophylaxis timing in patients with TBI [20]. This study similarly found that our patient population had decreased associated risk for mortality with the use of LMWH as compared to UFH; however, interestingly we found that the associated risk of VTE was similar between both the groups. Without a significant difference in the associated risk of VTE it might suggest that LMWH may have an effect on mortality that is not related to VTE and indicates the need for a large prospective study to definitively determine if and what benefit LMWH may have over properly dosed UFH.",

Furthermore, the timing of the VTE event and whether the VTE occurred prior to placement, during use, or after removal of the ICPM is not available within the database. Similarly, we are unable to account for any association with non-pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis such as ambulation or mechanical compression devices.
