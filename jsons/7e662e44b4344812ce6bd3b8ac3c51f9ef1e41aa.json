[6] [7] [8] [9] Patients may also present as decompensated cardiovascular disease, collapse or diabetic emergencies.

Previous small studies have suggested that rapid molecular viral testing might reduce antibiotic use and improve influenza antiviral use.

Priority areas identified include improving diagnostic tests for viral respiratory illness and improving the clinical management of patients with acute respiratory viral illness, both addressed by this study. With the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance to global public heath there is increasing need for the research and development of interventions which can help avoid unnecessary antibiotics use.

With 1:1 allocation to groups, there will be 420 patients per group. On the conservative assumption of a 25% positivity rate for influenza during influenza season (i.e. ~100 influenza positive patients in each group) the group sizes would give a 90% power at a 0.05 significance level to detect a difference of 20% in appropriate neuraminidase inhibitor use (from 65% to 85%) and an 80% power to detect a difference of 17%. In our previous work 91% of influenza positive patients randomised to POCT were appropriately treated with NAI versus 65% with routine clinical care, a difference of 26% (95%CI 10 to 43). We suspect that the difference may be larger in this study as there will likely be a number of undiagnosed (and therefore untreated) cases in the control group revealed by testing them with the FilmArray at a later date. In the event of higher numbers of influenza positive patients being recruited in the first two seasons, the study may be stopped prematurely (once 100 influenza positive patients have been recruited to the intervention group).",

Rapid and appropriate use of NAI treatment in influenza may also lead to decreased complication and mortality and may shorten length of stay in hospital. The rapid detection of viruses may improve isolation facility use within the NHS with subsequent reduction in nosocomial transmission of viruses and improvements in patient flow through acute areas. The use of a POCT for respiratory viruses may also identify patients where unnecessary antibiotic use can be safely discontinued, promoting antibiotic stewardship and reducing antimicrobial resistance.",

[2] Antibiotic over-use for acute respiratory illness is partly driven by clinical uncertainty regarding the underlying aetiology; therefore early identification of viruses may prevent or shorten unnecessary antibiotic use. Previous small studies have suggested that rapid molecular viral testing might reduce antibiotic use and improve influenza antiviral use. [31, 32] We have recently shown in a large pragmatic randomised controlled trial (ResPOC) that routine syndromic molecular POCT for respiratory viruses (using the FilmArray respiratory panel) in adults presenting to hospital with acute respiratory illness was associated with a number of clinical benefits compared to routine clinical care including a reduction in unnecessary antibiotics use, and a reduced length of hospital stay. It also suggested improved influenza detection and antiviral use and better side room utilisation, although the numbers of influenza infected patients was small and the study was not powered to evaluate outcomes in this subgroup. [33] This follow-on study seeks to definitively evaluate the impact of routine molecular POCT for influenza on the detection of influenza infected patients, their clinical care and outcome. Accepting the unpredictability of influenza activity year on year, this study is designed to recruit larger numbers of influenza infected patients, and powered to evaluate the impact of POCT on national guideline recommended antiviral use. In addition the novel use of sampling and deferred viral testing in the control group allows a direct assessment of missed diagnosis of influenza in hospitalised adults. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y 14",

            "text": "We hypothesise that the use of a routine molecular POC 'test and treat' strategy for influenza in adults hospitalised with acute respiratory illness will improve adherence to national guidelines for the management of influenza and may improve patient outcomes. We expect increased, timely detection of influenza and that this will lead to improved use of NAI treatment. Rapid and appropriate use of NAI treatment in influenza may also lead to decreased complication and mortality and may shorten length of stay in hospital. The rapid detection of viruses may improve isolation facility use within the NHS with subsequent reduction in nosocomial transmission of viruses and improvements in patient flow through acute areas. The use of a POCT for respiratory viruses may also identify patients where unnecessary antibiotic use can be safely discontinued, promoting antibiotic stewardship and reducing antimicrobial resistance.

These molecular platforms are broadly equivalent in accuracy to laboratory PCR, without the need for specialist laboratory support and expertise, can provide a result in under 1 hour and can potentially be used as a point-of-care test (POCT).",
