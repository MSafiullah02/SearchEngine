The shortage of healthcare resources, lack of sanitation, and population compactness leads to an increase in communicable diseases, which may increase millions of people add in a vicious cycle of poverty. The study used the number of factors that affect poverty incidence in a panel of 76 countries for a period of 2010-2019. The dynamic panel GMM estimates show that the causes of death by communicable diseases, chemical-induced carbon and fossil fuel combustion, and lack of access to basic hand washing facilities menace to increase poverty headcounts, whereas, an increase in healthcare expenditures substantially decreases poverty headcounts across countries. Further, the results show the U-shaped relationship between economic growth and poverty headcounts, as economic growth first decreases and later increase poverty headcount due to rising healthcare disparities among nations. The causality estimates show that lack of access to basic amenities lead to increase of communicable diseases including COVID-19 whereas chemical-induced carbon and fossil fuel emissions continue to increase healthcare expenditures and economic growth in a panel of selected countries. The rising healthcare disparities, regional conflicts, and public debt burden further 'hold in the hand' of communicable diseases that push millions of people in the poverty trap.",

Few of the scholarly writing presented here that related with the study theme for ready reference, i.e., Wernery and Woo (2019) discussed the vulnerability of MERS that is zoonotic viral disease affected both animals and human beings. This disease largely hit the country's economic Nomenclature M. K. Anser, et al. Environmental Research 187 (2020) 109668 development projects and increase food security challenges due to the shortage of healthcare resources that lead to an increase in poverty headcounts. The close surveillance of disease is highly recommended to prevent this disease from the massive population. Adhikari et al. (2020) reviewed the scholarly literature on novel coronavirus and come to the conclusion that healthcare expenditures enormously increases along with an increase in the intensity of spreading novel coronavirus. The only given therapy is the adoption of modes of prevention from this virus, else no specific antiviral treatment yet launched, thus symptomatic treatment is given the affected people to enhance the immunity against the virus. However, it should be remembered that the novel coronavirus is highly deadly and its effect evenly to the rich and poor nations. Thus, prevention is the only remedy for this pandemic. Thienemann et al. (2020) discussed the causes and prevention of coronavirus in low-income countries. The study argued that high population density areas, increase poverty incidence, and already ill patients of HIV, TB, and other parasitic diseases largely affect the COVID-19. The need for effective healthcare policies and prevention strategies would be helpful to minimize the incidence of coronavirus in the slums area with designated social distancing policies and sanitation policies across countries. Khan et al. (2020) concluded that COVID-19 is extremely deadly and it affects both the developed and developing countries. The developed countries could have a better healthcare strategy to cope the zoonotic viral diseases including COVID-19, while developing countries, like Asian countries, could hard to find the way to escape it, as due to lack of access to basic amenities and the countries that already have an incidence of common pneumonia, which cause high fatality rate in spite of the availability of treatment and vaccination make it more vulnerable situation in low -income countries. The main factors include high poverty rate, political conflicts and instability, violence, illiteracy, poor diagnostic laboratories, and other infectious diseases competing for a shortage of healthcare resources. The issues are very severe and its impact could be put more pressure on the country's economic and healthcare resources that need to be addressed and understand in a short while. Rollins (2020) conferred the effect of 2019-nCOVon children, their parents, and poor community, as low-income earners and the people remain in poverty face difficult time to survive with the disease, while children are less likely to affect, and their parents need to take care with their family through adopting preventive measures. The study presented some general literature related to poverty and its main determinants in order to assess the government reforms towards pro-poor growth (see, Table 2 ).",

Secondly, climate change is more likely to affect the poorer community, as due to lack of healthcare resources and insufficient household income, they are unable to cope with the environmental pollutants that are emerged with greater use of chemical use in the manufacturing process. Sooner and later, the government reforms for the conservation of the natural environment by using renewable fuels would minimize the risk of climate change, followed with pro-poor growth policies may escape poorer from climatic vulnerabilities. Thus, the study includes chemicals -induced carbon and fossil combustion in poverty modeling to get assess poverty incidence across countries. Third, without including economic growth and income inequality, the growth-inequality-poverty (GIP) triangle could not be completed, as both the factors are important in poverty modeling to assess pro-poor growth policies. For this purpose, the study included GDP per capita and lack of access to basic amenities (a proxy for inequality) in poverty modeling to get some insights about pro-poor growth process across countries. Healthcare expenditures have a direct relationship with poverty reduction, as more of the healthcare resources devoted by the government, its trickle down to lower-income strata group, which poor can get a benefit as compared to non-poor to sustain their livelihood. Thus, social expenditures also have included in poverty modeling. Finally, the government enforced the need for 'social distancing' to minimize the risk of coronavirus outbreak and it could possibly be reduced by proper city planning, as the world is largely compact and becomes a global village and the high chunk of poor nations reside in slum areas that are highly dense, and the chances of spread of any infectious diseases are more likely to exposed to the poor community. On the basis of this importance, the study included population density in poverty modeling and discussed its implication in the light of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The study started with the traditional endogenous growth theory where human capital is considered the main vital factor that increases a country's economic growth. Poverty trap is another factor that largely drains the human capital resource because of a vicious cycle of poverty. The earlier studies on poverty reduction and emphasis to make growth more 'pro-poor' based on growth-inequality-poverty (GIP) triangle, for instance, Kakwani and Pernia (2000) , Bourguignon (2004) , Klasen and Misselhorn (2008) , Kakwani et al. (2010) , Khan et al. (2014) , Kakwani et al., (2018) , Zaman et al. (2019) , etc. These studies argued that poverty is the function of economic growth and income inequality, i.e., higher the country's economic growth (or household income), lesser will be the poverty headcounts or vice versa. This specification does not imply that economic growth (or household income) is the only factor to design pro-poor growth policies. The economic growth itself could be the \"necessary condition\" of poverty reduction but may not be the \"sufficient condition\" of poverty reduction. Thus, the need to identify some other possible determinants of poverty is highly desirable. In search of the factors, the judicious income distribution is the other possible factor that could be used in pro-poor growth formulation, i.e., higher income inequality will decrease economic growth, which eventually increases poverty headcounts across countries. Thus, the need to contain income inequality in GIP formulation is desirable for analyzing long-term social development programmes. This specification is shown below for ready reference, i.e.,",

The maximum value of carbon emissions and fossil fuel combustion is 23.811 metric tons per capita and 99.977% of total energy with an average value of 5.578 metric tons per capita and 72.323% respectively. The maximum value of GDP per capita is US$110742.3 and an average value of US $17230.83 with a standard deviation of US$19392.71.

Population density increases carbon and fossil fuel combustion during a study time period. Table 6 shows the dynamic panel GMM and VAR Granger causality estimates and found that there is a positive relationship between communicable diseases and poverty headcount, which implies that an increase in communicable diseases lead to increases in poverty headcount in a panel of selected countries. The results are discussed in the light of novel coronavirus as the global economy is largely affected with an unwanted epidemic plaque in recent dates. The latest report of World Economic Forum (2020) discussed the vulnerability of coronavirus disease for poorer countries that are already drowning in debt and unable to spend sufficient amount on healthcare expenditures, while on the another side, rich nations spending billions of dollars to build new hospitals for the prevention of this epidemic outbreak. This inequality leads to many negative outcomes in the prevention of communicable diseases that could be sustained by transferring healthcare equipment, knowledge transfer and lessening the debt burden to the poorer nations. Aljazeera (2020b) report shows that millions of poor are directly hit by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus during the lockdown in India, thus the high need for making adequate planning to tackle this plaque is required to save economic and human toll. Rasmi (2020) argued that United Nation doing hard struggle to generate around US$2 billion for the poorer countries and war-torn countries to control the coronavirus pandemic. The limited COVID-19 testing swaps, inadequate medical care facilities, and limited funds to fight against the spread of epidemic raised many unsolved questions that need to be answered by joint economic collaboration.",

Finally, inadequate healthcare expenditures and low basic hand washing facility lead to an increase in poverty headcount by adopting a transmission channel of exacerbated infectious diseases including COVID-19. The Conversation (2020) report shows that fight with coronavirus could become more difficult where the assessment of basic hand washing facilities are less available, as a case study of India, the report argued that Indian economy could face the main challenge of lack of basic sanitation facility, which can extremely affect millions of poorer in a country. UNICEF (2020) report highlighted the urgent need to use basic healthcare sanitation facilities including hand washing with soap and water to fight against coronavirus. The report shows the fact sheet where numerous countries unable to provide basic sanitation facilities and billions of people are 'out of reach' from access to basic hand washing facility. Thus it could affect largely to the poorer nations that have low healthcare spending and less access to basic healthcare sanitation facilities. The similar insights get from the latest report issued by Business Standard (2020) for Indian economy where a lack of basic amenities among poorer community get harder to fight against this novel coronavirus. The diagnostic tests confirmed that the given results are reliable as it falls under the basic statistical assumptions. The Jstatistic value, instrumental rank and AR-values confirmed that the instruments used in the given model are accurate and reliable, and there is no existence of possible autocorrelation in a given model.

The causality results imply that lack of basic amenities menace to increase communicable diseases, which is the forefront issue in fighting against the coronavirus (Thomas-R\u00fcddel et al., 2020; Wax et al., 2020, etc) . The other result implies that high population density increases chemical-induced carbon emissions that lead to increase country's economic growth on the cost of an emerging pandemic like COVID-19 (Qiu et al., 2020; Ficetola and Rubolini, 2020, etc) . The chemical-induced carbon and fossil fuel combustion leads to an increase in healthcare expenditures, which remains to create a hurdle against the fight of coronavirus.

Thus the need of collaborative efforts to fight against this epidemic plaque is imperative for long-term sustained growth. This study identifies the potential risk of communicable diseases including COVID-19 that largely affect the poor community in a panel of 76 countries by using a time series data of 2010-2019. The dynamic panel GMM estimates show that increase risk of spreading communicable diseases including COVID-19, chemical-induced carbon and fossil fuel combustion, and lack of sanitation largely affected poorer peoples while increased use of healthcare resources decreases poverty headcounts across countries. The non-linear relationship is found between economic growth and poverty reduction that follow a U-shaped relationship between them. The causal inferences can be deduced by the following given directional relationship, i.e., causality mainly running from lack of access to basic amenities to communicable diseases, healthcare spending to country's economic growth, and chemicals use to healthcare spending. The forecast relationship among the stated variables corresponds that communicable diseases, chemicals -induced carbon and fossil combustion, economic growth, and lack of access to basic amenities will likely to increase poverty headcounts for the next 10 years time period.",

            "text": "The following policy implications are recommended for healthcare specialists, environmentalists, and Government officials to get benefited from it and make use for against coronavirus pandemic, i.e., i) To designed national prevention policies for epidemic plaque and assure that everyone could respond and act upon them. Further, the need of some strict action plans are desirable, firstly, everyone including children, adults and old age peoples should have to be wear preventive masks when go outside the home, else some possible penalty should be imposed; secondly, during a lockdown, it should be assured that no one could get outside except in some genuine cases, however, they should be protective enough to come out, and thirdly, special take care required for the poorer communities, they mostly worked on daily wages and they largely affected by the lockdown, so the government should have to collect the data of the needy peoples and allocate some emergency funds for their foodstuff so they can spend these days in prevention. The case study of Pakistan for taking these measures is an exemplary figure in this regard. ii) Communicable diseases evenly affected poor and rich nations so no one can escape out from this epidemic if not taking preventive measures, however, due to wide healthcare disparities among the globalized world, the poorer nations could get more likely to expose with this epidemic plaque as compared to the rich nations. The same situation exists for the poor and rich person, both can evenly affect with the infectious disease, however, prevention is better than cure, so rich can prevent his/her self more likely as compared to the poor person due to having sufficient knowledge about this pandemic and have an ability to fight against this disease, while on the other side, due to dearth of economic and healthcare resources with the poorer, they exposed more likely to this epidemic and get trap in a vicious cycle of poverty. Now there are two possible options with the government, first, if the country has enough resources, then the government should have to devote their all resources for the prevention of infectious diseases and side-by-side used expansionary fiscal and monetary policy instruments, thus due to less imposition of taxes and get some subsidy to the business sector, while when a business enterprise get a loan on less interest, so the businesses could gain momentum and it will ultimately lessen the economic depression phase. Further, the rich countries should allocate some funds to the poorer countries in order to defeat this epidemic and shared knowledge, technical, and healthcare expertise as well, thus poorer nations could be able to defeat the epidemic like COVID-19. Secondly, if the nation has fewer resources and have engaged with some political and regional turmoil, further engaged with high debt and bear some economic sanctions from the world community, thus it should have to re-correct their policies and resolve all political and regional disputes in these unprecedented times and get back the expertise from the developed world and to get swap their debt with healthcare resources that could get able to prevent it from COVID-19 pandemic. iii) The greater need of basic access to hand washing facilities is a precondition to escape with the novel coronavirus. The countries that have a lack of access to basic amenities are largely affected by this epidemic outbreak, thus every government should have to provide frequent soap and water to their peoples to prevent their selves with this pandemic. Few solutions are suggested, i.e., soap and hand sanitizers should be freely available at less price and the government should have to monitor their prices, secondly, drinking water should be boiled first and use it semi hot, it will also help to get a person more healthy, and thirdly, keep avoid contact to others. The good thing is most of the precautionary measures are already used by the global world and spread it by the media and word-of-mouth. iv) The climate change always remains a hot debatable topic in the environmental literature, as industrialization process keep producing new toxic air pollutants, most of them likely to the mutant and converted into novel coronavirus, although there is not get any substantial evidence in this regard, however, we cannot ignore the hidden reality that most of the infectious diseases caused by air pollutants that need environment sustainable policies like advancement in the cleaner production technologies, and adopting strict environmental regulations, so it would be helpful to minimize the risk of infectious disease across countries, and v) Poverty reduction remains a key agenda of the United Nation and in 2015, the United Nations proposed 17 sustainable development indicators (SDIs) among which the first and second foremost goal of SDIs are related with poverty and hunger-reduction. The infectious disease can be more likely to spread through lack of knowledge, lack of income, and lack of healthcare resources, which unintentionally multiply by many folds as in a case of coronavirus. Although there is no such evidence found with the given data set that poverty cause communicable diseases, however, the result of the study found that lack of basic amenities increases communicable diseases that affect poor citizen more than non-poor. Thus we may not ignore the possibility of existence of more causal channels between the stated factors in future. The government should give indemnity to the poor community to resolve their hunger issues at priority, secondly, the government need to establish a social safety net and include in a priority agenda to reduce half of the poverty and hunger as per the agenda of the United Nation till 2030 would be reduced, thirdly, government should give provide jobs to the poorer in a way to register them free of cost in any hands-on-training centre and give some little honorarium so the poor can be able to get benefited from it, forth, government officials should have to fortnightly visit the slums area of nearby their residencies and enlist all their problems and related issues, and get resolve it in a stipulated time period, so if God forbid, any disaster happens, then the people could be able to sustained and cope with the problem, and finally, monitoring and command system should be vigilant, the governments should devise a policy for the betterment of the countries and took strict actions against those that get find some undue favour by using their authority.",

Thus, the poor get more benefits in terms of utilization of healthcare services in a country. The gallstone disease put a high burden on healthcare expenditures, which largely increase healthcare insurance premium in a country.inequality Healthcare disparities largely affected poor community more than non-poor. Air pollutant and incidence of TB put a burden on poor people that cause high poverty headcounts. The larger medical expenditures associated with TB diagnosis and its prevention leads to increase the overall cost of TB care that largely affected the poorest households. The prevalence of malaria infection largely affected the poorest households as compared to the less poor. The higher risk of maternal death and under \u22125 mortality rate is associated with high healthcare expenditures, while the depth of food deficit causes a greater chance of increase TB incidence across countries.household size, and health status Poverty increases in rural China is mainly attributed to increase non-communicable diseases that affect household head/family members.
