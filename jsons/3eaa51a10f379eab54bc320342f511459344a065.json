            "text": "DC-SIGN is a member of the C-type lectin family. Mainly expressed by myeloid DCs, it is involved in the capture and internalization of pathogens, including human CMV. Several transcripts have been identified, some of which code for putative soluble proteins. However, little is known about the regulation and the functional properties of such putative sDC-SIGN variants. To better understand how sDC-SIGN could be involved in CMV infection, we set out to characterize biochemical and functional properties of rDC-SIGN as well as naturally occurring sDC-SIGN. We first developed a specific, quantitative ELISA and then used it to detect the presence sDC-SIGN in in vitro-generated DC culture supernatants as cell-free secreted tetramers. Next, in correlation with their inflammatory status, we demonstrated the presence of sDC-SIGN in several human body fluids, including serum, joint fluids, and BALs. CMV infection of human tissues was also shown to promote sDC-SIGN release. Based on the analysis of the cytokine/ chemokine content of sDC-SIGN culture supernatants, we identified IFN-\u2425 and CXCL8/IL-8 as inducers of sDC-SIGN production by MoDC. Finally, we demonstrated that sDC-SIGN was able to interact with CMV gB under native conditions, leading to a significant increase in MoDC CMV infection. Overall, our results confirm that sDC-SIGN, like its well-known, counterpart mDC-SIGN, may play a pivotal role in CMV-mediated pathogenesis.",

DC-SIGN contains a CRD that is highly conserved in lectins and a neck region consisting of Ig-like domain repetitions, which mediate a pH-dependent oligomerization of DC-SIGN monomers and thus, increase affinity with its ligands [5] [6] [7] [8] . During monocyte differentiation toward MoDCs, DC-SIGN expression has also been reported to be induced by IL-4 and to be negatively regulated by IFNs, TGF-\u2424, and dexamethasone [9] .",

[13] ). Interactions between DC-SIGN and pathogenic-derived sugar moieties have been shown to play a prominent role in vivo in favoring the capture and internalization of microbes [14] , with or without the help of other Ag-capture receptors, such as the macrophage mannose receptor (CD206), DEC-205 (CD205) [15] , or the mac-rophage galactose-type C-type lectin [16] . In contrast to other C-type lectins, several transcripts have been described for DC-SIGN, most likely originating from alternative splicing and potentially leading to the expression of sDC-SIGN proteins [17] . As described already for the DC-SIGN homologue, DC-SIGNR (or CD209 ligand) [18] , such cDNAs have been reported by others to encode nonsecreted sDC-SIGN molecules [19] . In addition, the same study showed that sDC-SIGN displayed no functional activity in terms of ICAM-3-dependent cosignaling compared with mDC-SIGN.",

Consequently, the DC-SIGN-mediated increase in virus entry resulted in a strong CMV infection of MoDC. The study in question shed new light on the molecular interactions that favor DC infection by CMV and especially the pivotal role played by DC-SIGN as a docking and internalizing receptor. CMV is a widespread herpesvirus that infects 40 -100% of the populations worldwide. It induces lifelong viral persistence and may cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV or transplant patients. The major CMV host entry sites are myeloid DC-containing peripheral tissues, especially oropharyngeal and genital mucosa. In the present study, we investigated expression regulation and functional properties of naturally occurring as well as rsDC-SIGN variants. We demonstrated that such variants can promote CMV infection of MoDCs, as already shown for their counterparts, mDC-SIGN. These data suggest that sDC-SIGN variants may play a crucial role in the CMV-mediated pathogenesis.",

Alternatively, DCs were generated from CD34 \u03e9 CBPs, as described already elsewhere [17] . Immunomagnetically purified CBPs were cultured in medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml stem cell factor and 50 ng/ml GM-CSF (R&D Systems).

To determine whether corresponding proteins exist, we first isolated DC-SIGN-encoding cDNAs from monocyte-or CD34 \u03e9 cord blood cell-derived DCs by PCR. The primer used in this PCR allowed for the insertion of a FLAG tagencoding sequence in the 5\u0408 position (Fig. 1A) . Only 10 selected cDNA clones were submitted to a second round of PCR to retain the sole TM region lacking cDNAs, thought to probably code for sDC-SIGN (Fig. 1B) . Four of the 10 clones were not amplified by the TM-specific internal PCR (Clones 2, 3, 6, and 7; Fig. 1A and B). These cDNA clones lacking the TM exon were sequenced and blasted against known cDNA libraries. Then, we confirmed that three out of these four isolated cDNAs were completely identical to a sequence reported previously by Mummidi et al. [17] (i.e., sDC-SIGN1A type I isoform-encoding sequence; GenBank Accession Number NM_001144896) and that the last one encoded a spliced variant, the sDC-SIGN1A type III (Gen-Bank Accession Number AY042227). We then subcloned sDC-SIGN1A type I-and III-encoding cDNAs (called thereafter FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 and T3) into prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression plasmids as required. An ELISA was produced simultaneously to measure sDC-SIGN isoform concentrations in cell culture supernatants or in any other biological fluids. The FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 protein of prokaryotic origin was used to obtain a standard curve and set up our homemade ELISA (Fig. 1C ). Although our sDC-SIGN ELISA was moderately sensitive with a typical concentration range of 100 -0.1 ng/ml, we were able to validate its specificity. In fact, by means of selective IP experiments on sDC-SIGN standard solutions, we could demonstrate that 1B10 mAb or H-200 pAb (the coating pAb), directed against DC-SIGN, abrogated sDC-SIGN detection, whereas an irrelevant mAb had no effect, i.e., FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 was still detected by ELISA (Table 1) . Interestingly, a homotypic ELISA, i.e., the same antibody (clone 3E1) used as the primary (capture) and secondary antibody, led to low signal detection. This observation evoked the possibility that the FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 protein was expressed as multimers. This issue is addressed at a later stage in this paper.",

            "text": "Previous studies have reported that TM-lacking encoding DC-SIGN sequences are transcribed as soluble cytoplasmic pro-teins but not secreted by the sDC-SIGN-expressing transfectant cells or immature MoDCs [19] . It was our hypothesis that the lack of secreted proteins in culture supernatants may be a result of a secretion defect or the lack of a signal peptide [25] . Of note, certain proteins, such as IL-1\u2423, FGF2, or galectin-1/3, are secreted, despite being devoid of a signal peptide [26 -29] . As a result, we surmised that the same could be true for sDC-SIGN. Thus, using our quantitative and specific ELISA, we observed the presence of potential sDC-SIGN isoforms in 10\u03eb concentrated cell culture supernatants of mDC-SIGN-expressing DCs. In vitro DCs were generated from adult monocytes or CD34 \u03e9 CBPs, according to already well-known protocols [17, 23, 30] . Somewhat surprisingly, increasing quantities of sDC-SIGN were found in both DC-derived culture supernatants in relation to postdifferentiation time ( Fig. 2A and B) . sDC-SIGN appearance in culture supernatants was correlated with the addition of rIL-4. This observation was consistent with previously published observations showing that upon differentiation, IL-4 was required to induce mDC-SIGN expression [9] . To know whether sDC-SIGN and mDC-SIGN expressions could be differentially regulated during differentiation, MoDCs were generated with several cytokine cocktails (IL-4/GM-CSF, IFN-\u2423/GM-CSF, and IL-13/GM-CSF) or IL-4/IL-13 alone. All combinations, except the one using IFN-\u2423, were able to induce sDC-SIGN and mDC-SIGN to the same extent, as assessed by Western blot (Fig. 2C and D) . Taken together, these results provided strong evidence that sDC-SIGN may be secreted by in vitro-generated DCs and that sDC-SIGN and mDC-SIGN were regulated in a similar manner in the course of DC differentiation.",

However, we failed to purify sufficient amounts of highpurity sDC-SIGN for N-terminal sequencing. To circumvent these difficulties, we alternatively treated MoDCs with a broadspectrum inhibitor of MMPs (i.e., a disintegrin and metalloprotease/TACE family), called Marimastat (British Biotech, UK), which was supposed to have no effect on sDC-SIGN release. Differentiating DCs were incubated with increasing doses of Marimastat. At Day 6, mDC-SIGN expression was analyzed by flow cytometry, and sDC-SIGN was quantified in culture supernatants by ELISA (Fig. 3A , respectively, black and open bars). Despite the use of high concentrations of Marimastat (10 M), no modification of sDC-SIGN versus mDC-SIGN expression patterns could be observed, thus weighing in favor of a sliced, sequence-derived product and not a shedding of mDC-SIGN by MMPs.",

Tetramerization is dependent on the neck length consisting of various Ig-like domain repeats [5, 32] and also on the extracellular pH [8] . The question we posed ourselves was whether this was the case for sDC-SIGN using gel filtration. Here again, we were unable to purify sufficient sDC-SIGN from MoDC cultures to perform our analysis. As a result, we produced rFLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 and T3 in E. coli and separated them according to their apparent MW by gel filtration. For each sample, fractions were collected and analyzed by ELISA. The results are shown in Fig. 3C . sDC-SIGN quantities were plotted against elution volumes, and elution volume of the maximum sDC-SIGN quantities for each sample was determined on the plot. Column precalibration allowed us to calculate each apparent MW meas of the most abundant sDC-SIGN isoform found in each sample. Thus, the FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1-associated peak was eluted with 52 ml, corresponding to an apparent MW of 175 kD. An approximate, MW theor of 46 kD was calculated on specialized websites (MW theor ; http://www.expasy.org/) for FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1. As MW meas was about four times larger than MW theor (ratio\u03ed3.8), we concluded that FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 could be expressed as tetramers in nondenaturing and nonreducing conditions. Applying the same procedure for the FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT3, it was estimated that unlike sDC-SIGN1AT1, sDC-SIGN1AT3 could probably be found in culture medium as a dimer (MW meas \u03ed81 kD; MW theor \u03ed32 kD; ratio\u03ed2.5). Purified CRD (\u03f319 kD) was used as a control here, as it was unable to multimerize. Peak-associated fractions of the FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 gel filtration run were pooled and concentrated ten-to 15-fold onto centrifugal filter units (10 kDa cutoff) and finally analyzed by Western blotting in denaturing and reducing conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 3D . In this setting, we only observed FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 as a 40-to 45-kDa pro- tein, suggesting that FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 is expressed as a homotetramer in native conditions. All of our data indicate that sDC-SIGN proteins are secreted in a MMP-independent manner as exosome-free homotetramers, at least for fulllength sDC-SIGN variants.",

            "text": "We demonstrated above that sDC-SIGN is secreted by human blood-borne, precursor-derived DC-SIGN \u03e9 DCs in vitro. Thus, we assumed that it could be secreted by DCs in vivo. Our study first analyzed human sera from healthy donors by Western blot (n\u03ed21; Fig. 4A ). Much to our surprise, sDC-SIGN was detected in 19 of the 21 sera with a heterogeneity of expression between individuals. Following this, we tested a broader panel of human serum from healthy donors (n\u03ed62) by ELISA. Consistently with the Western blot analysis, almost all sera contained detectable amounts of sDC-SIGN ranging from 0 to \u03fe150 ng/ml with a mean value of 65.36 ng/ml (min\u03ed0 ng/ml; max\u03ed154 ng/ml; median\u03ed72 ng/ml; 25th percentile\u03ed32.41 ng/ml; 75th percentile\u03ed95.75 ng/ml; Fig. 4B ). The serum sDC-SIGN concentrations were comparable with the lower amounts of MBL variants, which are found in human serum in a broad range of concentrations, depending on their genotype [33] . Further gel-filtration experiments demonstrated that serum sDC-SIGN was more probably expressed as tetramers, which was consistent with our previous results obtained with rFLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). mDC-SIGN has previously been associated with Th2 responses, at least in vitro [34, 35] . However, certain experimental findings came to our attention, showing that DC-SIGN may be up-regulated in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease [36, 37] . We hypothesized that sDC-SIGN may be found in inflammatory body fluids. For this purpose, BALs were harvested from patients suffering from diverse lung diseases, including primary CMV infections, and tested for the presence of sDC-SIGN. When segregated according to the inflammatory status of samples (based on diagnoses, i.e., viral infections, etc.), the quantity of sDC-SIGN was clearly higher within inflammatory (mean\u03ed24.4 ng/ml) compared with noninflammatory BAL (mean\u03ed1.37 ng/ml; P\u03ed0.0005; Fig. 4C ). To confirm these observations, we compared sera and joint fluids from RA versus osteoarthritissuffering patients. Joint fluids from RA patients were indeed prototypical inflammatory fluids, whereas joint fluids from os- teoarthritis were considered as mechanical fluids marked by the absence of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). As shown in Fig. 4D (left panel) , there was a highly significant difference between sDC-SIGN amounts in RA versus control joint fluids (P\u03ed0.006). When analyzing the related sDC-SIGN concentrations in the sera of the same patients (Fig. 4D, right panel; P\u03ed0.02) , a similar difference could be observed, thus promoting the conclusion that sDC-SIGN expression was closely correlated to the inflammatory status of these human biological fluids (Fig. 4E) . Taken together, these results largely confirmed the fact that sDC-SIGN is produced in distinct biological fluids, and its expression ap-pears to be up-regulated by inflammatory disorders, as exemplified here in the case of RA.",

We therefore infected freshly isolated mucosal explants of human origin (vagina or cervix biopsies) with a high viral load and further incubated them for 7 days before freezing. Frozen tissue sections were stained to reveal nuclear IE/E CMV Ag in infected cells or DC-SIGN. As shown in Fig. 5A , DC-SIGN \u03e9 cells were located exclusively in the lamina propria (Fig. 5A, d and e) of freshly isolated explants (Fig. 5A, a) or of 7-day noninfected explants (Fig. 5A, b) , whereas after a 7-day infection period, DC-SIGN \u03e9 cells were distributed equally among the mucosal epithelium and the lamina propria (Fig.  5A, f) , as shown by a sharp nuclear staining of IE/E CMV Agpositive cells (Fig. 5A, c) . In the course of these experiments, explant culture supernatants were collected and analyzed by ELISA to quantify secreted DC-SIGN. The results are described in Fig. 5B . Upon infection, sDC-SIGN release was \u03f32.5 times higher in explants when compared with the basal sDC-SIGN release after 7 days in noninfected explant supernatants, as well as in freshly isolated explant supernatants. We then confirmed that CMV infection contributed to the establishment of an inflammatory environment by showing that typical cytokines (IL-6 and IFN-\u2425) or chemokines (CXCL-8/IL-8 and CXCL-10/IP-10) were overproduced in explant supernatants upon infection (Fig. 5C ). LPS stimulation for 24 h was used as a positive control of cytokine/chemokine release. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that sDC-SIGN expression could be up-regulated by a viral infection of freshly isolated peripheral tissues.",

Focusing on molecules overexpressed in explant culture supernatants upon CMV infection or LPS activation, experiments were performed using fully differentiated immature MoDC, subcultured with various doses of human rCXCL-8/IL-8, rCXCL-10/IP-10, rIFN-\u2425, and rIL-6, alone or in combination. To minimize the effect of exogenous IL-4, which is necessary to differentiate MoDC but also able to induce sDC-SIGN, potentially leading to misleading conclusions, cells were first starved of IL-4. In that setting, sDC-SIGN release was up-regulated significantly by IFN-\u2425 and to a lesser extent, by CXCL-8/IL-8 in a dosedependent manner when compared with the spontaneous level of sDC-SIGN secretion by IL-4-starved cells (i.e., \"no IL-4\" experimental conditions; respectively, P\u03ed0.01 and P\u03ed0.001), whereas no significant effect could be shown after adding exogenous CXCL-1/IP-10 or IL-6 ( Fig. 6) . It should be noted that CXCL-8/IL-8 and IFN-\u2425 act in an additive but not synergistic manner to induce sDC-SIGN production by IL-4-starved immature MoDCs. The stimulation level in that case is equivalent to the \"IL-4 alone\" experimental condition. IL-6 unresponsiveness is most likely a result of the absence of a functional receptor on the cell surface, as no significant staining for gp130, i.e., the signaltransducing chain of IL-6R, could be observed by flow cytometry (data not shown). In accordance with our previous data, we hereby demonstrated that sDC-SIGN is re-in-duced by exogenous IFN-\u2425 and/or CXCL-8/IL-8 in fully differentiated immature MoDC cultures.",

            "text": "We demonstrated above that sDC-SIGN secretion is promoted by an inflammatory setting and even upon CMV infection of human tissue explants. Thus, it remained to be determined whether sDC-SIGN has a protective or facilitating effect on CMV infection. First, we tested the functionality of FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 through its ability to interact directly with the CMV envelope gB, which we identified previously as a ligand for mDC-SIGN [20] . Lysates of transiently transfected HEK cells were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated further with FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 or specific mAb as a detection control to document interactions between gB and sDC-SIGN under native conditions (Fig. 7A) . When incubated with FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1, gB \u03e9 cell lysates could be revealed by a HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody, whereas the anti-FLAG alone did not provide any signal. FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 \u03e9 HEK cell lysates were used as positive controls for DC-SIGN and FLAG detection. An additional actin detection was used as a loading sample control. These results suggested that the FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 was functional. However, the functional role of sDC-SIGN during the CMV infection remained unclear. On the basis of the MBL-mediated inhibition of HIV susceptibility reported in the literature, we first hypothesized that sDC-SIGN might neutralize the CMV infection of MoDC. In this setting, we were unable to block MoDC infection, even using higher concentrations of FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 (data not shown). In addition, as mDC-SIGN expression was reported to be responsible for MoDC CMV cis-infection, we assumed that FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 may function as a promoter of the infection. For this purpose, MoDC were infected with TBGFP CMV (MOI\u03ed1) for 24 -48 h in the presence of decreasing amounts of FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 (from 400 to 12.5 ng/ml). The GFP \u03e9 MoDC, indicating the percentage of early infected cells, was estimated by flow cytometry. Infected MoDC frequencies were approximately twice as high (33.1\u03ee6%) as the control infection (14.8\u03ee7.2%) when incubated with 50 ng/ml FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1-supplemented culture medium (P\u03ed0.01; Fig. 7B ). A 100-ng/ml concentration was not sufficient to mediate a significant infection enhancement when compared with control infection. Surprisingly, it was observed that FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 concentrations higher than 100 ng/ml and lower than 50 ng/ml did not modify the infectious rate of MoDC. To confirm that the deleterious effect that we could observe was specific to sDC-SIGN, we conducted similar experiments but only using an optimal amount of FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 (50 ng/ml), which was first captured or not onto a mannan-conjugated resin (Fig.  7C, upper panels) . Here again, the addition of FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 doubled the GFP \u03e9 MoDC percentage (32.5% vs. 15.7%). This enhanced infection was readily a result of FLAG-sDC-SIGN, as it was abrogated by a preincubation step of the recombinant lectin on mannan-conjugated agarose. As a negative control, we also performed the same assay with FSF, which we reported previously as being prone to CMV infection in a DC-SIGN-independent manner ( [20] ; Fig. 7C lower panels). All of these results led us to conclude that FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 is functional and is able to facilitate CMV infection of MoDCs. ",

In the present study, we developed and used a specific and quantitative ELISA to demonstrate the secretion of sDC-SIGN in concentrated MoDC culture supernatants. The fact that Martinez et al.

[17] , we cloned cDNAs lacking the TM-encoding exon and coding for putative sDC-SIGN from distinct, in vitro-generated DC populations. In our study, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs was used to avoid a possible shedding of mDC-SIGN at the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, MoDC and tissue-residing DCs expressed two or three other membrane-associated MMPs that might not be targeted by MMP inhibitors [38] . However, MMP inhibition did not result in a difference of sDC-SIGN and mDC-SIGN expression by MoDCs. These results all confirmed previous observations reporting sDC-SIGN expression as a soluble, full-length molecule. Another crucial issue was to check whether sDC-SIGN could be expressed as an exosomeassociated protein, as suggested in a recent report [39] . Briefly, exosomes derived from DC-SIGN \u03e9 murine bone marrow-derived DCs were shown to express DC-SIGN on the basis of cytometric analyses. On the other hand, as a result of very slight DC-SIGN staining of exosomes, these results were not convincing and had to be interpreted with caution. In this case, based on the measurement of sDC-SIGN concentrations with our ELISA, we could undoubtedly argue in favor of the expression of sDC-SIGN as exosome-free molecules. The final proof of the secretion of a full-length sDC-SIGN would be to sequence the naturally occurring sDC-SIGN protein, but we failed to purify sufficient amounts of it to obtain any kind of irrefutable proof.",

These results were in line with those published by Relloso and colleagues [9] in a previous report. In addition, we did not test IFN-\u2425 during monocyte differentiation in DCs, but we tested IFN-\u2423, which was sufficient to prevent DC-SIGN expression when added at the very beginning of MoDC differentiation. In contrast, it had no effect when added after 2 days postdifferentiation (data not shown), strongly suggesting that DC-SIGN expression was irreversible. This idea was borne out by a former study reporting the IL-4-dependent and irreversible up-regulation of PU.1, a specific transcription factor of the myeloid lineage, mainly responsible for the induction of DC-SIGN expression in MoDCs and monocyte-derived macrophages during their in vitro differentiation [41, 42] . In this study, besides IL-4 or IL-13, we used fully differentiated immature MoDCs as a cellular model to document what inflammatory soluble factors could be involved in the sDC-SIGN secretion that we detected in several human body fluids. Surprisingly, IFN-\u2423 and most probably, type I IFNs, in general (although this remains to be experimentally ascertained), were shown to impair DC-SIGN during cell differentiation, whereas IFN-\u2425 was identified as a good inducer of sDC-SIGN by fully differentiated immature MoDC. CXCL-8/IL-8 was also demonstrated to promote sDC-SIGN expression but to a lesser extent. When added together as exogenous cytokines on IL-4-starved MoDCs, we observed additive effects on sDC-SIGN secretion, suggesting that they may be both required to induce optimal sDC-SIGN secretion, albeit weakly. Even at higher doses of IFN-\u2425 and/or CXCL-8/IL-8, we were unable to attain the sDC-SIGN secretion level obtained with IL-4 or IL-13 in vitro. To explain why, in such a case, IFN-\u2425 induced and did not repress sDC-SIGN secretion by MoDCs, one could argue once again that fully differentiated immature MoDCs have a distinct transcription program coordinated by distinct transcription factors (i.e., PU.1, etc.) compared with monocytes during their differentiation.",

            "text": "In genital human mucosa, after 7 days of ex vivo CMV infection, we noted a significant increase of sDC-SIGN secretion by residing DCs. The analysis of the cytokine content of infected biopsy supernatants confirmed the presence of IFN-\u2425 and CXCL-8/IL-8 in sufficient amounts to imagine their direct involvement in the induction of sDC-SIGN. In these experiments, no difference of mDC-SIGN expression by dermal DCs could be observed by immunostaining. Based on our own results, we expected that sDC-SIGN induction could be correlated with the same up-regulation of membrane isoforms. However, it is our belief that the explanation for this discrepancy can be found in a recent study reported by Liu et al. [18] , indicating that the vast majority of DC-SIGNR, a closely related DC-SIGN gene product found in HIV mucosal inoculation sites, i.e., anal and genital mucosa, was encoded by TM lacking spliced cDNA sequences [17] . These data pointed to a differential expression of sDC-SIGN versus mDC-SIGNR isoforms in virally infected peripheral tissues. Despite being unable to document any differential expression of DC-SIGN in vitro, we cannot rule out this possibility in vivo. To better understand if this were the case, discriminating antibodies are currently being generated in our laboratory. Interestingly, former studies provided strong evidence that RA synovia contained high levels of CXCL-8/IL-8, which may be a result of viral infection caused by CMV [43] . Here, these molecules were detected in high amounts in infected BAL or RA joint fluids, suggesting that they could also be sDC-SIGN inducers in vivo. Moreover, CXCL-8/IL-8 was up-regulated in the female genital tract in the course of coinfection with CMV and HIV-1 [44] . This observation substantially supported our sDC-SIGN induction data in genital mucosa explants. CXCL-8/IL-8 was already known as an efficient neutrophil and macrophage chemoattractant, and a link had been established between high serum concentrations and the CMV disease occurrence in patients after liver allotransplantation [45] .",

On the basis of previous reports in the literature, we endeavored to forge a link between sDC-SIGN concentrations and a Th2 cytokine environment, marked by high amounts of IL-4/13 in sera and BAL from atopic patients. Unfortunately, we were unable to show significant correlation (data not shown). In contrast, we demonstrated that high amounts of sDC-SIGN could be correlated to high amounts of cytokines and chemokines, usually overexpressed upon inflammation in diverse body fluids, such as serum, BAL, or joint fluids, from patients suffering from autoimmune, inflammatory, or infectious diseases. These results match the data reporting an increased number of mDC-SIGN-expressing macrophages in BAL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected patients [3] , as well as in RA synovia [4] . Several studies have already reported a link between high frequencies of mDC-SIGN \u03e9 -infiltrating cells and the proinflammatory environment found in Crohn's disease lesions [37] . One can easily imagine that these mDC-SIGN \u03e9 cells may also be able to secrete sDC-SIGN upon inflammation and/or infection. Thus, on the basis of these unexpected results, we suggest that DC-SIGN, whether sDC-SIGN or mDC-SIGN, may be considered as a new marker of tissue inflammation.",

            "text": "Our final investigation focused on sDC-SIGN functions. Several studies have already documented the fact that rsDC-SIGN was able to neutralize HIV and dengue virus infection of transfectants or MoDC at similar mean concentrations (i.e., from 0.5 to 50 g/ml [46, 47] ). Although Navarro-Sanchez et al. [47] reported convincing data, they used truncated rsDC-SIGN, only consisting of the DC-SIGN CRD domain, which was shown to be expressed as monomers in solution by others [5] . CRD monomers had a limited affinity for their ligands in comparison with tetramers [40] . Here, we provided strong evidence that FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 was capable of interacting with the CMV gB, already known to be a ligand of mDC-SIGN [20] . Using our tetrameric rsDC-SIGN, we were unable to inhibit CMV infection of FSF, even when sizeable sDC-SIGN amounts were used (up to 17 M; data not shown). We then hypothesized that sDC-SIGN could function as an enhancer of CMV infection. As expected, low FLAG-sDC-SIGN1AT1 concentrations (varying from 10 to 100 ng/ml) allowed a significant increase in the percentage of IE/E CMV Ag \u03e9 immature MoDC from three distinct blood donors, whereas sDC-SIGN concentrations below and above this range had no potentializing effect. To explain this bell-curve effect, we proposed a hypothetical model at low but constant viral input. According to this model, at high sDC-SIGN concentrations, free virions are rapidly complexed, leading to an impaired binding and internalization of CMV into MoDC. Between 100 and 10 ng/ml, sDC-SIGN may serve as an opsonin with CMV virions with an optimal stoichiometry leading to the capture and internalization of a maximum number of sDC-SIGN-immobilized virions. When using very low sDC-SIGN concentrations (below 10 ng/ ml), the majority of virus is free, and the infection efficacy decreases to levels of infection without sDC-SIGN, as we postulated that sDC-SIGN-opsonized CMV was captured more efficiently by MoDC than free virions. This suggests the existence of one or several yet-unknown opsonic receptors for sDC-SIGN, which may not be able to interact with previously reported, truncated rsDC-SIGN [5, 46] . A novel study is under progress in our lab to fulfil the identification of such a receptor. However, based on the literature, we discuss putative candidates. First, ICAM-2 and -3, but not ICAM-1, are ligands for mDC-SIGN [10, 11] . However, only ICAM-1 is expressed by MoDC [48] . Although we cannot rule out, so far, the possibility for sDC-SIGN to interact with ICAM-1, the involvement of ICAM-2/3 in the sDC-SIGN-mediated infection enhancement in MoDC is likely to be inconceivable. Second, mDC-SIGN complexes have the propensity to form multimers (di-, tri-, and tetramers, depending on the neck length [7] ). As a consequence, one can imagine that sDC-SIGN, whether bound to CMV virions or not, may be able to dock on mDC-SIGN to form aggregates with pre-existing lectin homodimers or trimers. New experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis. We finally considered a last potential candidate receptor enabling the sDC-SIGN-mediated CMV infection enhancement, the CD11b molecule, also known as the \u2423M integrin, a macrophage antigen-1 or complement receptor 3 component when associated with the \u24232 integrin. CD11b is highly expressed by immature MoDC [49] . Interestingly, it has been involved recently in the uptake of mannosylated liposomes by macrophages in cooperation with a murine homologue of mDC-SIGN [50] . Furthermore, CD11b has also been described to function as a facilitating agent for HIV opsonization by immature MoDC in a mDC-SIGN-dependent manner [49] . It is thus highly tempting to speculate on the fact that sDC-SIGN-opsonized CMV particles may interact directly with CD11b, leading to their internalization and thus, promoting MoDC infection. Further experiments are obviously needed to confirm this hypothesis.",
