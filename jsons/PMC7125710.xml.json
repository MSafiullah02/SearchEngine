In contrast to this centralization and increased efficiency in laboratory diagnostics, there has been a recent trend towards a more decentralized diagnostic analysis, so-called point-of-care testing (POCT), which occurs directly at patients\u2019 beds, in operating theatres or outpatient clinics, or at sites of accidents. This modern variety of laboratory medicine is characterized by minimizing instrument size and procedures and the increasing use of current information technology. There are analytical devices available that make it possible to process a whole blood sample in a simple manner, allowing untrained staff to carry out laboratory diagnostics. It is clear that the use of POCT shortens the time between sample acquisition and analysis (turnaround time). However, this type of diagnosis is only useful if the results produced lead to immediate therapeutic decisions [1]. However, there is still a paucity of evidence supporting the use of POCT and improved patient outcomes [2].",

All outpatient or ward personnel will be expected to be able to use these analyzers. No previous knowledge in sample analysis should be required. However, there is a continual transition between POCT and laboratory-based methods. A generally accepted definition of POCT is still under debate. For example, viscoelastic coagulation tests, described below in this article as \u201cType 4\u201d POCT, are to be performed near the patient in cases of active bleeding. The results have to be available quickly to allow instant therapeutic action. However, the caregiver is mostly overstrained when operating the viscoelastic apparatus, so often these analyses are performed in a central laboratory with online transmission of the sensorgrams to the operating room; so these analyzers can be called \u201cpseudo-POCT\u201d.",

The signaling is often performed by simple visualization or by optical detection using a simple readout device. The detection principles span from chemical-indicator reactions to immunological reactions [e.g., immunochromatography (performed as lateral flow assays)]. The strips are made of a porous matrix mixed with dried reagents onto a carrier element. The sample (e.g., urine, blood, stool or swab material) is deposited onto the matrix and starts the reaction while penetrating and soaking the stick layer. Applications are urinary pregnancy testing, detection of blood in stool, urine dipstick analyses, detection of infectious agents in swab material and others, listed in Table 2\n. An interesting new product is the lateral-flow test for penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) from Alere Health (Atlanta, GA, USA) that detects PBP2a found in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) directly from bacterial isolates. The key determinant of the broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam resistance in MRSA strains is this PBP2a [6].",

This is valid for in-patient and out-patient care, and for home testing by patients. Although generally either capillary or venous blood is used, the results can be presented as blood-glucose or plasma-glucose level, depending on the calibration by the manufacturers. This can make a relevant difference of over 11%, potentially resulting in false therapeutic measures. To minimize the risk of confusion between whole-blood and plasma-glucose results, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) suggested in 2005 that glucose values should be given as plasma levels only, independent of sample type or measuring method. The USA and other countries have already followed this recommendation, and it is also now being implemented in the German-speaking regions [8], [9].",

However, the problems of end use by untrained or unsupervised personnel will increase, particularly with respect to pre-analysis (patient preparation, sample acquisition, recognition of invalid samples) and post-analysis (documentation, data protection) [1]. This is notably the case where POCT is used in areas far from a laboratory (e.g., developing countries). It is an important task for laboratory medicine as a whole to make it clear that POCT analysis that meets the medical requirements rests on more than reliable analysis systems.",
