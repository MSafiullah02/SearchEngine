            "text": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod\u2010borne pathogen that primarily affects ruminants in eastern and sub\u2010Saharan Africa first described following an outbreak on a farm in Kenya in 1931. Periodic outbreaks of RVFV since that time have resulted in significant losses to the African livestock industry as well as large numbers of infections in some of the most impoverished human populations. In one 2006/2007 outbreak across Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania alone, there were an estimated 145 000 human cases, and the ban imposed on imports after the 1997/1998 outbreak in Somalia led to a collapse of the vital livestock industry. Previously ignored, it is only in the past decade that the international community has started to take an increased interest in the disease. This followed the recognition of its potential to spread beyond the confines of the African continent after a large outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2000. There has also been acknowledgement of the widespread presence of arthropod vectors capable of transmitting RVFV in many non\u2010endemic regions of the world. This has led to a range of increased efforts in better understanding the virus and developing tools to predict outbreaks, combat the disease and limit its spread (Anyamba et al. 2010; Pepin et al. 2010).",

The United States for instance, included RVFV as a candidate pathogen in its offensive biological weapons programme; a programme officially closed in 1969 (Borio et al. 2002). In more recent times, the classification of the virus as a potential bioterrorism agent has spurred investment and activity, particularly in the area of vaccine development and diagnostics (Borio et al. 2002; Sidwell & Smee 2003).",

After the signing of the US Patriot Act of 2002 and the classification of RVFV as a \u2018select agent\u2019, visiting experts and scientific collaborators are, for instance, now required to provide fingerprints, signed affidavits and be registered with intelligence services before working with the pathogen. Such measures are likely to act as a disincentive amongst scientists wanting to study the virus and could ultimately serve to drive experts to dedicate their efforts to other pathogens with fewer working restrictions (Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service, Centre for Disease Control & Prevention 2005, 2011). These restrictions have also been applied in parts of Europe as well, with national legislation such as the Anti\u2010terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 of the UK, which also includes RVFV as a potential bioterrorism agent. For comparison and contrast, we include the current lists of biological agents and toxins around which bioterrorism legislation has been passed in the US and UK in Table 1.",

            "text": "Focus on US policy internationally stems from its greater leadership role within the global community and the influence and impact its decisions have on people and institutions far beyond its borders. With large numbers of laboratories worldwide affected by US policy either directly through funding or indirectly as a result of political influence, restrictions have also resulted in the transfer between laboratories of RVFV samples for culture also becoming constrained and increasingly expensive. This undermines efforts to lower the industrial production costs of existing vaccines and of commercial kits for virus neutralisation and ELISA diagnostic tests (currently the prescribed tests for international livestock trade) (World Organization for Animal Health 2008). Expertise and experience thus tends to remain confined to a limited number of laboratories and companies by and large located in high income countries where investigation of the disease is neither a significant economic or health priority nor considered sufficiently profitable for drug companies. The resulting monopolies on expert technical knowledge and skills not only delays progress in developing new therapies and vaccines but also increases their costs by limiting production capacity and competition. Increased sales costs of vaccines in particular have put at risk well\u2010established mechanisms of international cooperation in global infectious disease surveillance. This risk was highlighted in 2006 and 2007 with Indonesia's refusal to share H5N1 samples with WHO (Sedyaningsih et al. 2008).",

            "text": "The potential risks of RVFV to animal health are indeed significant and so the deliberate release of the agent would have indirect health effects on human populations through the destruction of the livestock industry in particular. Although the possibility of industrial sabotage or \u2018agroterrorism\u2019 is thus real, the potential direct bioterrorism risk to human health of RVFV is far more limited. On the most important criteria of pathogenicity and transmissibility, RVFV is a poor candidate choice as an anti\u2010human bioterrorism agent, with no recorded cases of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission and a relatively low mortality rate of 1\u20132% in humans. Complicated infections, characterised by haemorrhagic fever or encephalitis, are similarly limited to about 1% of infected cases (Pepin et al. 2010).",

            "text": "While aerosolised droplet transmission of the virus is clearly possible, with notable recorded transmissions occurring in abattoir and laboratory workers from infected animal specimens and parts, this is not a unique feature amongst a plethora of infectious diseases. RVFV with its low mortality and relatively low human\u2010to\u2010human transmissibility in comparison with other viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) viruses such as Ebola, Marburg or Lassa, should have its risk profile assessed independently. As such, while the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has indeed categorised VHF viruses as category A bioterrorism agents (Box 1); it specifically refers to filoviruses (e.g. Ebola and Marburg) and arenaviruses (e.g. Lassa) in this regard, and RVFV does not appear at all in its list of potential bioterrorism agents (Centre for Disease Control & Prevention 2012). Expert commissions have, however, at times tended to band all VHFs together, resulting in legislation that has overplayed the specific risk of RVFV to human health (Borio et al. 2002). For instance, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, using the same categorisation as the CDC, includes RVFV specifically as a category A agent thus incorrectly implying high pathogenicity and high human\u2010to\u2010human transmissibility (National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases 2011).\n",

In the event that the virus was selected for development as a bioterrorism agent, the current wide ranging restrictions placed on legitimate scientists and vaccine/diagnostic kit manufacturers working with the virus are unlikely to act as a significant deterrent to entities determined to obtain live RVFV samples for culture and study. With the virus so widespread in so many parts of Africa, obtaining live samples from an array of vertebrate hosts and culturing it thereafter is a relatively simple process (Box 2) (US Department of Health & Human Services USPHS, Office of Emergency Preparedness 1995). Such restrictions thus potentially hinder the development of necessary biological solutions for wider disease control and also provide a false sense of security.",

With new advances in recombinant techniques, there may thus be a heightened sense of wariness around the potential for a more pathogenic (to humans) variant of the virus being produced by bioterrorists. For RVFV in particular, this is tempered to an extent in comparison with other bunyaviruses as it is believed to have a relatively low tolerance to genetic mutation (Pepin et al. 2010). As such, while it is important to recognise that evolving technologies mean that RVFV still poses a theoretical bioterrorism risk, it is arguably more important to recognise that the virus causes very real morbidity and mortality naturally and that this consideration should take precedence in the worldwide approach to combating the disease.",

In recent years, there has been a welcome increase in interest globally in combating this disease, and these efforts should be encouraged. However, to fully benefit from this increased interest, international policies related to biosecurity concerns around the virus should be revisited and tempered. This would not only enable better, more efficient focus on pathogens that do constitute a significant biosecurity risk, but also importantly, allow the global community to accelerate the progress being made towards improving RVFV control.",
