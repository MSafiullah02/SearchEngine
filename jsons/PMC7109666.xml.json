            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder due to a range of mutations in the CF gene affecting the cAMP-regulated chloride channel (CF transmembrane regulator or CFTR). In the lungs, this leads to dehydration of the peri-ciliary layer such that the mucociliary escalator cannot perform its function of clearing particles (including micro-organisms) from the airways. Patients develop acute and later chronic respiratory infection leading to a cycle of further damage and less ability to clear infection. The range of micro-organisms causing infection differs from those in patients without CF with the commonest pathogens being Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.1,2 Antibiotics are used to clear early infection, treat acute exacerbations of chronic infection and reduce the frequency of exacerbations (by use of long-term systemic or inhaled drugs). These treatments have had a major impact on the quality and survival of patients with CF. There are still however questions about the best way to diagnose infection and the use of antibiotics in patients who will need repeated courses during their lifetime. Bacteria in chronic infection have different characteristics from those causing acute infection, including atypical phenotypes leading to difficulty in identifying some species in the laboratory. Antibiotic resistance\u2014both from infection with innately resistant bacteria and also the development of multi-resistant strains\u2014is an increasing challenge to CF. Although infection remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality,3 recent advances in understanding the role of different species and modes of pathogenicity hold much promise for improved treatments.",

Hypermutator bacteria have mutations in DNA repair or error avoidance genes such that the spontaneous mutation rate is raised. Mutator strains of S. aureus have been identified in CF, some due to inactivation of a DNA mismatch repair gene mutS.10 Another mechanism that may help the long-term survival of S. aureus in the CF lung is the ability to form biofilms. This may be important for infection of medical devices and prostheses such as artificial heart valves and orthopaedic implants. The role of biofilms in CF is however unclear and needs further investigation.",

Major attempts are being made to control the spread of resistant S. aureus,11 with some success in the UK. However, the prevalence of MRSA in CF patients is increasing12 and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, although very rare, are being seen in non-CF patients.

Resistance included decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, which is rarely seen outside CF. One-third of patients had hypermutable strains.

Eventually, chronic infection develops and this leads to a faster decline in lung function. The age at which infection becomes chronic has increased with better treatment of CF. This is particularly due to the practice of intense treatment with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics when P. aeruginosa is first cultured, which can delay the onset of chronic infection and increase life expectancy in CF. The patient may be clinically stable when chronically infected with P. aeruginosa but has repeated episodes of acute exacerbation with increased breathlessness, sputum production and feeling unwell. These exacerbations are also marked by a reduction in lung function. Exacerbations are generally treated with a combination of systemic antibiotics.5 Inhaled antibiotics, most commonly colistin or tobramycin, can be used to help clear early infection. They can be effective as long-term prophylaxis, reducing frequency of acute exacerbation once infection is chronic. More recently, long-term azithromycin prophylaxis has been used in CF. This followed experience with treating diffuse pan-bronchiolitis, a condition described in Japan that also leads to chronic infection with P. aeruginosa. The benefit of long-term oral azithromycin has been shown in CF,19 with fewer exacerbations, better lung function and a reduction in inflammatory markers. Macrolide antibiotics may act because of their anti-inflammatory activity or by modifying the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa (see below).",

Some siblings did have the same strain but it was unclear if this was due to cross-infection or acquisition from a common source. In contrast, more recent studies revealed the spread of the so-called epidemic strains, some of which were multi-resistant. This would not necessarily be a particular concern except that some, for example, the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES), may be more pathogenic and can superinfect patients already colonized with other strains of P. aeruginosa. Infected patients had more exacerbations, time in hospital and courses of antibiotics.20 Furthermore, when patients were first infected with multi-resistant epidemic P. aeruginosa early aggressive treatment often failed.21 This led to a policy in the UK of segregating patients with epidemic strains. The LES genome was recently sequenced and work is progressing to determine the basis of transmissibility and enhanced pathogenicity. Most strains of LES are hyper-producers of pyocyanin. This is a putative pathogenicity factor with effects including reduced beating of respiratory epithelium cilia and induction neutrophil apoptosis, and is regulated by quorum sensing (QS) (lasA).22",

Methods to improve the detection of resistant sub-populations have been described.25,26 However, the only big study to correlate antibiotic resistance to clinical response showed that lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second) improved in patients in spite of treatment with antibiotics to which their P. aeruginosa were resistant in vitro.27 Antibiotics seldom if ever eradicate chronic infection with P. aeruginosa from the CF lung. Even the resolution of symptoms and signs of an exacerbation may not be matched with a significant reduction in bacterial load. It may be therefore that antibiotics are effective without actually inhibiting or killing the bacteria\u2014the so-called sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) effect. This may also explain the successful treatment of infection with antibiotics, even though the bacteria are resistant. For example, at sub-MIC concentration, ceftazidime can inhibit attachment to cells and ciprofloxacin can reduce alginate production.28 Although P. aeruginosa is intrinsically resistant, azithromycin may reduce pathogenicity by inhibition of QS and biofilm formation.",

Different results can however be obtained with different methods and there is no accepted reference standard.30 There are few studies that attempt to correlate the results of synergy testing with the clinical outcome. One randomized prospective study compared the MCBT with traditional single antibiotic susceptibility testing for determining treatment of acute exacerbation with a range of multi-resistant species in CF including P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc). This showed no better outcome when antibiotics were chosen on the basis of the result of MCBT.31 The role of current methods of synergy testing is controversial, but there is a definite need for clinically validated in vitro tests to guide treatment of multi- and pan-resistant bacteria at acute exacerbation and when patients receive lung transplants.",

One study showed hypermutators in 37% of CF patients with chronic infection with P. aeruginosa.32 This was the highest prevalence described in a natural system. Since then hypermutators have been shown in other chronic lung diseases.33 Hypermutator strains were found amongst isolates of P. aeruginosa early in infection suggesting that they may have an advantage in initiating infection as well as in chronic infection, however they were infrequent.34 It was questioned whether mutator strains would be at a disadvantage because of the high rate of damaging spontaneous mutations. However, their ability to rapidly adapt to a changing environment becomes an advantage in an ecological niche repeatedly exposed to antibiotics. In the large population of bacteria in the CF lung, an organism with a mutation for antibiotic resistance may be present even before the antibiotic is given. It has been practice in CF to give two anti-pseudomonal antibiotics to reduce the emergence of resistant strains. The recent observation of hypermutators in CF shows the potential importance of that recommendation.",

Biofilms are communities of bacteria within an acellular matrix, usually attached to a surface\u2014in CF, the respiratory epithelium. In the patient, biofilms may also contain other species of bacteria and host-derived products. Bacteria in biofilms are difficult to eradicate as they can resist the host immune system and are more antibiotic resistant by a variety of mechanisms. Antibiotics may bind to the extracellular matrix or have reduced activity in areas of poor oxygenation or low pH. Also the bacteria in a biofilm live in a gradient of oxygen, nutrients and metabolites. They are therefore diverse, having adapted to the different micro-environments. The growth phase (actively dividing or dormant) may affect their susceptibility to some antibiotics.35 The variability in antibiotic susceptibility seen in the population of bacteria cultured from a single sputum under the same in vitro conditions may be because bacteria are present in biofilm fragments in the sputum. These organisms may have adapted to a range of different active concentrations of antibiotic encountered in different levels of the biofilm. Concern that laboratory methods developed to measure the antibiotic susceptibility of planktonic bacteria causing acute infections may not be relevant to CF has led to development of methods to test antibiotic susceptibility in a biofilm. Evaluation of one method to determine the optimum antibiotics to clear chronic infection is in progress.36",

Early and late isolates of P. aeruginosa from 29 patients were compared to look at these genes. One of the commonest mutations was in las R, the principle QS regulator in P. aeruginosa. This interferes with many pathogenicity factors including biofilm formation. This is difficult to reconcile with the proposed importance of biofilms in persistence of infection. Other genes commonly mutated after chronic colonization are also involved in pathogenicity e.g. exo A, the regulator of type III secretion and antibiotic resistance (genes coding for components of multi-drug efflux pumps). The picture that may be emerging is therefore of an organism with a great ability to adapt to its environment that becomes less pathogenic with time, presumably in itself a device for long-term survival in its host. A recent study has shown that antibiotic-resistant genes are not over-represented in hypermutators and that hypermutability may play an important more general role in genome evolution and adaptation in the CF lung.38",

Bcc survives well in natural and healthcare environments and some strains most notably the ET12 lineage of B. cenocepacia easily spread between patients. Controls to reduce cross-infection including segregating patients have been the main reason that infection and mortality has declined significantly.

Cepacia syndrome can occur when the organism is first acquired or unexpectedly many years after initial infection.

It is important however that they are correctly identified. This is so that any association with significant disease may be recognized but also because some may be mistaken for known pathogens.

A similar mis-identification rate occurs between A. xylosoxidans and atypical multi-resistant forms of P. aeruginosa.

Infection with NTM was more common in older patients and was associated with better lung function and co-infection with S. aureus rather than P. aeruginosa. There appears to be a geographical influence on the overall prevalence; this ranged from 24% in New Orleans to 7% in Boston. It is uncertain however whether these differences relate to different climate or vegetation or reflect the antibiotic and steroid usage in those CF clinics. Members of the Mycobacterium avium complex were most frequently isolated (72% of patients), with M. avium, the predominant species. Almost all patients had unique strains with no evidence of cross-infection and 10% had mixed species. Mycobacterium abscessus only accounted for 16% of NTM cultured in the US study but has been increasingly reported in CF patients in Europe.53 This seems to be associated with a more severe infection, and research on pathogenicity is needed. M. abscessus colonies can either be rough or smooth depending on the expression of glycopeptidolipid (GPL). It has been proposed that the smooth form (with GPL) forms biofilms in vitro and is less pathogenic\u2014favouring colonization whereas the rough form produces little GPL, infects human monocytes and causes persistent invasive infection in a mouse model.54,55 A similar relationship between colonial morphology and virulence has been proposed for M. avium and M. kansasii. There have however been no studies to test the clinical relevance of these observations. In common with other bacteria that may persist in biofilms, M. abscessus appears less susceptible to antibiotics when grown in biofilms than in planktonic cultures.56",

These were thought to be due to contamination with saliva, however these bacteria may be present in such large numbers that it is more likely that sputum was seeded during small-volume aspiration and multiplication takes place in the sputum.61 Two main lines of investigation have focused on these bacteria. Careful culture techniques have shown the large number and diversity of anaerobes that can be cultured from CF sputum.62 The use of 16s rRNA gene profiling by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms directly from CF sputum has shown a great diversity of anaerobic and aerobic species.63 What is the significance of these observations? It may be that these flora are just bystanders (commensals). Alternately, some may actually be pathogenic and have been missed because they are present in a mixture with an assumed pathogen such as P. aeruginosa. This could even explain why CF patients may improve when treated with antibiotics to which the conventional pathogen is resistant in vitro.27 Another explanation is that members of the \u2018normal\u2019 flora may interact with the conventional pathogen. In one study, a viridan-type Streptococcus was shown to enhance the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa in an agar bead lung infection model in rats.61 This viridans-type Streptococcus and a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, both isolated from CF sputum, also upregulated P. aeruginosa genes.
