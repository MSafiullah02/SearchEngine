            "text": "Acute rhinitis is a common, usually self\u2010limiting primarily viral nasal inflammation. Among the most common viruses are rhinovirus, respiratory synticial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and influenza and parainfluenza viruses. Three pathophysiological phases are distinguished: a prodromal phase (white, pale mucosa), a catharactic phase (mucosa red, swollen, hypersecretion), and a viscuous phase (thickening of secretion, decrease of symptoms). Although acute rhinitis is among the most common causes of olfactory disorders,\n4\n there is little known about functional changes. In their experimentally induced common cold study, Akerlund et al.\n\n5\n observed an impaired olfactory function correlating with nasal congestion, suggesting a relationship between olfactory function and nasal congestion but not between olfactory function and nasal discharge. In another experiment, Hummel et al.\n\n6\n examined subjects suffering from a common cold using the Sniffin Sticks Test and observed an increase of olfactory threshold and a decrease of N1 amplitudes in recordings of olfactory event\u2010related potentials even when the nasal obstruction and discharge was controlled by the application of oxymetazoline.\n7\n These results imply that the observed olfactory changes in acute rhinitis may be independent of nasal congestion. Because the disease is self\u2010limiting and olfactory function usually recovers, patients rarely seek medical advice concerning the smell disorder during acute rhinitis. When the acute rhinitis subsides and the olfactory disorder persists, it is called a \u201cpostviral olfactory disorder\u201d or an olfactory disorder \u201cpost\u2010upper respiratory tract infection\u201d (post\u2010URTI).",

            "text": "This definition according to the European Position paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps\n23\n includes olfactory disorder as a symptom, which reveals that olfactory disorder is a very common symptom in this entity, especially in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which is defined as a disorder lasting more than 12 consecutive weeks.\n24\n Although CRS is a very common disease, its exact etiology still remains unclear. Therefore, the exact pathophysiology of the accompanying olfactory disorder is difficult to determine. It is tempting to classify the olfactory disorder in CRS with polyps as conductive alone. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that (1) these deficits rapidly improve after oral steroids; (2) the olfactory epithelium was believed to be an \u201cimmunological privileged\u201d site incapable of mounting a normal immune response to foreign proteins; and (3) biopsies revealed at least some normal appearing olfactory receptor neurons.\n25\n Recent evidence has shown, that at least partly, olfactory disorders are caused by an increase in olfactory receptor neuron apoptosis due to an extensive caspase\u20103 activity in CRS.\n26\n From the clinical point of view, it is important to remember that up to one\u2010quarter of patients with CRS are unaware of their decreased olfactory ability.\n27\n, \n28\n Together with the fact that subjective disturbance and measured olfactory function in patients only show a moderate correlation,\n29\n olfactory testing is mandatory especially prior to surgical intervention. The clinical endoscopic picture is diverse; polyps, mucous discharge, mucosal reddening and swelling, and purulent discharge may be present. Once again, the visibility of the olfactory cleft from an endoscopic view and olfactory function do not correlate. Psychophysical test results reveal alternations between hyposmia and anosmia because olfactory disorder develops slowly and therefore only a portion of the affected patients are aware of the disorder.\n30\n, \n31\n So far no study in these patients has been able to document an association between olfactory test scores and intranasal airway access factors whether measured by rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, or rhinoscopy. On the other hand, there seems to be growing evidence that the severity of histopathological changes in the olfactory mucosa, which can be seen in CRS, seems to be correlated with decreased olfactory function.\n32\n\n",

In Sj\u00f6grens syndrome, a syndrome which is defined by lymphocytic infiltration, immune complex deposition and destruction of exocrine glands, patients usually complain of a dry mouth. In these patients, taste sensitivity is reduced; however, there is a poor correlation between salivary flow and taste function.\n34\n Radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy leads to an inflammation of the oral mucosa (mucositis) usually followed by xerostomia. During the acute phase of the inflammation, patients usually suffer from pain and the taste disorder is one minor problem among others. As the oral mucositis decreases the consecutive xerostomia becomes apparent. At this stage, usually 1\u20132 months after therapy, taste function is still reduced and the patients especially noticed a reduction of the perception of bitter and salty quality.\n35\n The disorder can persist up to 2 years.\n35\n Studies using confocal microscopy have shown that after radiotherapy, taste pores are covered with epithelia cells, which might be one of the reasons why taste function is reduced.\n36\n\n",
