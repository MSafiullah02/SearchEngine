On April 1, in relation with the increasing medical literature data, the NFC hospital scientific medical committee including infectious disease specialists, ICU specialists, rheumatologists, biologists, and pharmacists, approved the off-label use of TCZ in patients with general status deterioration despite well-conducted standard care. Daily \"tocilizumab multidisciplinary team J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f meetings\" were organized to discuss patients' eligibility to receive TCZ. Based on the medical literature, we checked several criteria before starting TCZ treatment: no contraindication to TCZ, confirmed COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, failure of standard treatment, time to symptom onset \u02c37 days, oxygen therapy \u22655 liters/min, >25% of lung damages on chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and \u22652 parameters of inflammation or biological markers of mortality (with a high level) such as ferritin, CRP, D-dimers, lymphopenia, and lactate dehydrogenase.
