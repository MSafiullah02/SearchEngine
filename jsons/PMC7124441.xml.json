            "text": "Immunization with DNA vaccines results in humoral and cellular immune responses that protect against disease in preclinical models of infectious diseases, cancer, and autoimmunity [1]. Intramuscular (i.m.) injection has been the primary route of administration for DNA vaccines, and has been shown to elicit protective and therapeutic immune responses in many animal models. However, optimal antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses were induced with high doses of DNA in nonhuman primates and human volunteers [2], [3], [4]. Although it is difficult to quantitate the amount of plasmid DNA that enters cells or is degraded before they enter the nucleus and initiate gene expression, it is believed that \u2a7e90% of the DNA injected never gets into the cytoplasm and of the \u224810% that does enter the cell, \u2a7d1% enters the nucleus where gene expression occurs [5], [6]. This lower bioavailability may be due to major cellular barriers such as plasma, endo/lysosomal and nuclear membranes, nuclease degradation in vivo, and the fact that DNA has an overall net negative electrostatic charge [7], [8]. Although the use of DNA vaccines at high doses is feasible, it would impose serious limitations on the number of constructs that could be included in a vaccine. In addition, the use of very high doses of DNA is less favorable from a process economics standpoint [9]. There is, therefore, a clear need to induce effective immunity in humans with lower and fewer doses of DNA, as well as to increase the magnitude of the immune response obtained.",

Several groups have attempted to improve the delivery using cationic microparticles [9], chitosan [10], non-ionic block co-polymers [11] and cationic liposomes [12], [13]. Although such approaches have had some success, they are far from ideal because gene delivery is too complicated to be achieved with a single carrier molecule [14]. The viruses, having evolved in parallel with their hosts, have been employed in over 85% of gene therapy clinical trials because of their incredible gene delivery efficiency; however, few have proven to be immunogenic. A more promising direction would be to develop safer delivery vectors that would mimic key properties of viruses, a multi-component polymer, with each component performing a viral function [15], [16].",

            "text": "Here we have designed novel mannose-bearing chitosan oligomers (MBCO) microspheres with entrapping polyethylenimine (PEI)/DNA complexes to mimic the beneficial properties of viruses:(i)\nDNA condensation. For viruses, the nucleic acids are protected by a protein coat or capsid, which can form a hollow, symmetrical structure enclosing coiled genetic materials. The core of the microsphere is a polycation (PEI) capable of inducing DNA condensation. Conversion of a filiform molecule into a compact particle improves both chemical stability and physical properties.(ii)\nCell entry\u2014targeting. To enter their hosts, viruses divert the function of cell\u2013matrix and cell\u2013cell anchoring proteins, such as heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and integrins, which are responsible for cell entry by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Condensed DNA particles also require a specific surface for cell entry. For DNA vaccine, the activation of T-cell responses requires presentation of antigen by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), and it has been shown by a number of groups that the presentation indeed occurs by professional bone marrow-derived APCs rather than by transfected muscle cells themselves [17], [18]. In our approach, the surface of the microspheres is responsible for binding and entry to APCs. We decided to conjugate mannose to the surface of the microspheres because APCs, such as dendritic cells (DCs), express high levels of mannose receptor and mannose-related receptor, which are used for endocytosis and phagocytosis of a variety of antigens having exposed mannose and fucose residues.(iii)\nEndosome escape. After internalization, DNA microspheres must escape from the formed intracellular vacuoles. Viruses that do not fuse at the plasma membrane exploit endosome acidication as an escape signal, by means of sophisticated conformational changes of fusion proteins. In MBCO microspheres, PEI shares the ability to buffer the acidity of endosomes. The vacuolar pH should therefore decrease more slowly, with a large concomitant ionic concentration increase. Osmotic swelling due to water entry may then burst the parvacuole and release the complexes into the cytoplasm. This is the famous \u2018proton sponge\u2019 hypothesis. After preparation and characterization, the microspheres were administered to experimental animals and the immune responses induced were compared with immunization with naked DNA. A significant improvement in immunogenicity over naked DNA was achieved for both CTL and antibody induction of the MBCO microspheres. This technology offers an improved way of delivering DNA vaccine to the nucleus of cell, by mimicking viruses in their ability to do the same.\n",

Formed microspheres were washed with deionized water and separated by centrifugation at 11000g, then freeze-dried. The size distribution of the MBCO microspheres was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Zetasizer 3000 HS (Malvern Instruments, UK) and the value was calculated by volume measurement. The loading level of the DNA in the microspheres was determined by assaying the supernatant after centrifugation and measuring DNA by absorbance at 260 nm. The encapsulation efficiency of microspheres was calculated. The Zeta potential of the microspheres was measured on the same apparatus as DLS. Selected batches of microspheres were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for size and shape. AFM images of the microspheres were taken with a Nanoscope IIIa AFM Multimode (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) under ambient conditions. AFM was operated in the tapping mode with an optical readout using Si3N4 cantilevers (Nanoprobes, Digital Instruments).

A virus contains a single genetic (DNA or RNA) molecule which is coated with a specific number of capsid proteins in a compact viral size (20\u2013250 nm). Monomolecularity, stoichiometry, and size in addition to transfection ability are the golden criteria for artificial viruses. There is little doubt that viral characteristics can be incorporated into nonviral vectors to enhance delivery efficiency, but it is not necessary that delivery systems of the future must be \u201cviruslike\u201d particles. Instead, by understanding and incorporating the extremely efficient mechanisms of infection by viruses, DNA delivery systems will be viruslike in function, not necessarily in shape\u2014just as our aviation systems mimic the function of birds, but not always their morphology [29]. Based on previous studies, the ideal \u201cartificial virus\u201d system should possess the following properties: ease of assembly; efficient delivery leading to total transfection; stabilization of DNA before and after uptake; capability of traversing the presumed barriers to gene delivery (e.g., by incorporating viral components or mimicking viral characteristics); efficient decomplexation or \u201cunpackaging\u201d (e.g., intracellular controlled release) and efficient nuclear targeting. While no current nonviral systems have all these properties, biopolymers provide versatile chemistry with a wide variety of different functionalities.

            "text": "In this study, we have designed novel MBCO microspheres to specially address these desirable characteristics.(i)The mannose-bearing chitosan oligomers were chosen as an inert coat to enclose the DNA vaccine. Chitosan has been proposed as non-toxic biodegradable polycationic polymers with an extensive record of safe use for gene delivery systems [30], [31]. In most of these studies, commercially available chitosans of high-molecular weight (100\u2013400 kDa) were used. Unfortunately, these chitosans biodegrade slowly, which delays the release of the DNA. Another pharmaceutical drawback is their low solubility at physiological pH and their viscosity-enhancing properties at concentrations suitable for in vivo gene therapy [32]. We therefore produced a low-molecular weight version with an average molecular weight of 12 kDa chitosan by random depolymerization of chitosan (Table 1). The more easily dissociated chitosan oligomers gave a 10-fold higher gene expression in RAW264.7 cells in vitro as compared to the more stable high-molecular weight chitosan (Fig. 3). In addition, MBCO microspheres induced a higher luciferase expression in vivo than stable high-molecular weight chitosan microspheres at day of 1, 7 and 14 time points. Both our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that dissociation of the chitosan oligomer microspheres is a fast process for the release of DNA from the microspheres and the subsequent onset of action, compared to a biodegradation-dependent release [33]. Additionally, covalent attachment of mannose to the primary amine function of chitosan can target APCs and be internalized via recognition of the mannose receptor on the surface of APCs such as M\u03a6s (Fig. 3). The mechanism of the adjuvant effect achieved with MBCO microspheres is not currently known, but we believe that efficient delivery to APCs may be an important contributing factor.(ii)The core of the MBCO microspheres is a polycation (PEI) capable of inducing DNA condensation. PEI has been used for gene and oligonucleotide transfer into cells in culture and in vivo. It can, however, be rapid inactivation due to undesired interactions with components of the in vivo milieu. Polycations are generally less immunogenic than viruses: however, their activation of innate defense mechanisms is a major problem. Complement system activation by PEI has been demonstrated, with highly positive complexes being the most active stimulators [34]. In current study, activation of the complement cascade might be avoided by shielding the positive particles with mannose-bearing chitosan oligomers (Table 2). In addition, PEI possesses the ability to buffer the acidity of endosomes and is able to escape from them, based on the \u2018proton sponge\u2019 hypothesis. The former chitosan-based systems were the inefficient release from endosomes into the cytoplasm, causing low transfection efficiency [35]. In our system, a synergistic effect on transfection efficiency was clearly observed by the combined use of chitosan and PEI (data not shown). Hence, the MBCO microspheres mimic the following five desirable characteristics of a virus: (i) DNA condensation; (ii) cell entry\u2014targeting; (iii) endosome escape; (iv) compact viral size (200\u2013300 nm) and (v) efficient decomplexation.\n",

In doing so, they may replace recombinant viruses as the standard vehicle for genetic vaccine. However, we must first engineer the polymers to improve the delivery of genes from outside the target cell to the nucleus. Genetic vaccine vectors of future will be constructed much like viruses, mulitifunctional supramolecular systems that self-assemble around DNA, each component performing a function imitative of viral characteristics.",

Another key advantage of this system is its speed of immune induction. In recent years, outbreaks of Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and influenza A have caused concern that conventional DNA vaccination strategies are too slow at inducing immunity [36], [37]. This study has served to highlight the exciting potential of mulitifunctional supramolecular systems as a method of induction of a rapid immune response to DNA vaccines. In subsequent studies, several new biomaterials have been designed which overcome specific important gene delivery barriers. Further enhancements are needed to reach the gene delivery efficiency obtained by viruses, but results are encouraging and ultimately this technology holds great promise for use in humans.",
