Thermal cycling was performed at 50 \u00b0C for 20 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, 50 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 5 s and 55 \u00b0C for 1 min. The result was confirmed as negative if no Ct value or Ct value> 40 was obtained. Positive cases were confirmed if Ct value <37, and suspicious cases were defined if Ct value was between 37 and 40. For suspicious samples, the experiment was repeated multiple times with multiple swaps of sample for final confirmation.",

Patients showing continuous fever for more than 1 week, showing rapid progression as observed by imaging within 3-5 days, or showing progression into severe and critical conditions were given glucocorticoid methylprednisolone at 1 mg/kg for anti-inflammation (a treatment course of 5-10 days). Intravenous infusion of levofloxacin at 0.4 g/day was applied for severe patients to prevent bacterial infection.

The reason for the gender difference might be related to female oestrogen and X chromosome factors [7,10,11] and social gender roles because it is mostly men who go to work and travel more frequently in the culture of China; 2) The patients with COVID-19 outside Wuhan, Hubei province mostly had a history of living in Wuhan in the early stage (referred to as the first generation of patients), and later on, the second generation and third generations primarily showed clustered onset, which is consistent with the current report [9]. However, there were also patients who did not have contact with any people from Wuhan, but had the occupation of salesperson or window unit staff. This result indicated that the public spreading power of the virus is strong and that the survivability of the virus is long lasting [12]. However, we still need additional information on the epidemiological history and related life histories to draw a conclusion [13]. 3) The majority of young patients had ages of 30-49 years, and comorbidities of hypertension and diabetes were common in patients, but no patients had COPD. The median interval between the first symptom and admission to the hospital is 5 days, and the longest incubation period is 26 days, longer than the 24 days reported by academician Zhong Nanshan [14].",

This result indicated that smoking is not a protective factor for COVID-19 patients, consistent with the TH Rainer studies [15]. Currently, there are no confirmed cases of medical staff infection in our hospital, indicating that as long as the medical staff are properly protected, the chance of infection can be effectively blocked [16]; 5) The majority of the patients present with fever and cough, and most patients have intermittent fever and low fever, but a subset are characterized by fatigue, sore throat, and hoarseness, and accompanying symptoms include one case diarrhoea and one case of headache, similar to that reported by Wuhan [9]. One patient had no abnormal clinical manifestation, but this patient was previously in close contact with a person from another confirmed case, indicating that these unidentified symptom-less patients are a potentially horrible source of chain infection. 6) The proportion of severe/critical cases accounted for 41.1%, and the severe cases accounted for 38.4%. The critical cases that required admission to the ICU accounted for 2.7%, which is lower than the 26% currently reported in Wuhan [17]. The difference could be based on the different diagnostic criteria used because the new diagnostic standard, respiratory failure, shock, and other functional failures are viewed as critical criteria [3], which will significantly increase the proportion of severe cases. The proportion of patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.8 attributed to critical illness showed no significance difference compared with that of the ordinary group, and thus we could not only rely on low lymphocyte count as a single factor to predict progression risk factors for critical illness [17].",

For patients with high clinical suspicion, multiple sampling or combined sputum and alveolar lavage fluid might help to decrease the false negative rate [18]. Imaging is often reveals multiple patchy and ground-glass shadows in the lungs, which is common in the subpleural or peripheral regions of the lungs, whereas only one lesion occurred mostly in the early phase [19]. The clinical manifestations are not in parallel with the imaging changes. Imaging changes showed a 3-5 day delay relative to clinical symptom presentation. Certain patients have poor absorption and also display pneumonia or fibrosis, which are similar to viral pneumonia syndromes [[20], [21], [22]].",

The reasons are considered as follows: 1) The viral pathogenicity and toxicity are slightly higher in the first-generation patients, whereas the second-generation and third-generation patients consist mostly of mild and moderate cases, indicating that the transmission and viability of COVID-19 is notably strong under specific circumstances, which is consistent with the report by Qun Li [23]. The pathogenicity gradually weakens during the transmission process, and the reason for this observation needs to be further investigated; 2) Beginning in mid-January, greater attention was focused nationwide on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Patients in the surrounding areas of Wuhan cooperated with the government and took the initiative to go to the hospital for early diagnosis and treatment. 3) Shiyan has sufficient medical facilities and medical staff, with 5 first-class hospitals at grade 3A, and the medical resources per capita are high. Patients receiving timely and proper treatment is one of the reasons. 4)Patients were given nebulized acetylcysteine to inhale as an expectorant to protect their airways. At the same time, for patients with a strong inflammatory response and acute progression as observed on pulmonary imaging, the short-term use of low-dose glucocorticoid for anti-inflammation might be one of the reasons for achievement of good treatment outcomes.",

Obviously, the virus incubation period is long, the virulence is relatively low, and the onset is relatively secretive. At initial diagnosis, most of patients are classified as ordinary patients, whereas the number of patients who become severe and critical are lower than that reported in Wuhan.
