Classified as the only member of the Hepeviridae family, human HEV is recognized with at least four genotypes (HEV1, HEV2, HEV3, and HEV4). Compared to HEV1 and HEV2, HEV3 and HEV4 have potential zoonosis in swine, including some other mammalian species such as boar, deer, rat, rabbit, camel, and bat (Meng, 2013). The virus is non-enveloped with a plus-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (~ 7.2 kb) that contains three open reading frames: ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 (Tam et al., 1991). Of these, ORF1 gene is the largest (5109 bases) that codes for the non-structural/replicase polyprotein of 1703 a.a. (~ 186 kDa), essential for viral replication cycle (Ansari et al., 2000, Parvez, 2013b). Based on amino acid (a.a.) sequence homology of plus-strand RNA virus polyproteins, Koonin et al. (1992) had proposed methyltransferase (MeT), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), proline-rich (P), RNA helicase (Hel/NTPase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as well as undefined \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 domains within HEV ORF1.",

The Appr-1\u2033-pase is involved in the tRNA splicing pathway that catalyzes the conversion of ADP-ribose-1\u2033-monophosphate (Appr-1\u2033-p) to ADP-ribose (ADPR). So far, ~ 300 orthologs of X-domain have been identified in eukaryotes (Karras et al., 2005) as well as animal plus-strand RNA viruses like, coronaviruses (CoV), alphaviruses, rubella virus (RUBV) and HEV (Gorbalenya et al., 1991, Draker et al., 2006, Snijder et al., 2003, Ziebuhr, 2005). Among the CoV, X-domains of human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E), severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are shown to have an Appr-1\u2033-pase activity, in vitro (Egloff et al., 2006, Putics et al., 2005, Saikatendu et al., 2005). Also, the structure of the SARS-CoV Nsp3 X-domain has been determined in isolation (Saikatendu et al., 2005) as well as in complex with ADPR (Egloff et al., 2006).",

Therein, the first stretch contains two Asn residues, of which the second Asn was reported essential for the Appr-1\u2033-pase activity of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV X-domains (Karras et al., 2005, Putics et al., 2005). Moreover, single a.a. substitutions within the alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) X-domain have been shown to significantly suppress viral pathogenesis in infected mice (Tuittila and Hinkkanen, 2003). Therefore, viral X-domains are also proposed to interact with some cellular ADPR/macrodomain proteins, involved in host pathobiology (Karras et al., 2005). Conceivably, based on known sequence-function homology, the present study investigated the role(s) of X-domain conserved residues in HEV replication cycle, using the viral genomic-replicon/S10-3 culture model.",

The amplicons (5.0 \u03bcl each) were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the correct size of the plasmid. Further, each amplicon was digested with Dpn I (Invitrogen, USA) in a 10 \u03bcl reaction volume at 37 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. The digested mix (5 \u03bcl each) was transformed into DH5\u03b1 XL-blue competent cells (Strata gene, USA) by the heat-shock method and plated on ampicillin-containing agar plates. Following an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, bacterial colonies were picked and plasmids (Qiagen Plasmid Mini-prep Kit, Germany) were screened by restriction digestion.

S10-3 cultures transfected with wild-type transcript (pSK-GFP-WT) showing green fluorescence served as the positive control while those receiving replication of incompetent/defective transcript pSK-GFP-G816V or pSK-GFP-G817V (Parvez, 2013b) was included as the negative control. All transfections were done in duplicate and repeated.",

Mutational analysis did not grossly affect the mutant replicons because the RNA yield was similar to wild type in all cases (Fig. 3B). Notably, the \u2018Gly\n \u2192 \nVal\u2019 mutants had been previously studied (Parvez, 2013b). Since differential phenotypic effect of \u2018Gly\n \u2192 \nVal\u2019 compared to \u2018Gly\n \u2192 \nAla\u2019 had been observed on enzymatic activity in RUBV, the \u2018Gly \u2192 Ala\u2019 mutants were compared with their \u2018Val\u2019 counterparts. FACS analysis showed GFP-positive and negative cells in pSK-GFP-WT and pSK-GFP-G816V transfection controls, respectively (Fig. 4\n). Of the mutant replicons, Gly816Ala and Gly817Ala constructs completely abrogated HEV replication, similar to their Gly816Val and Gly817Val counterparts, respectively (Fig. 4). However, the Gly815Ala mutant replicated very poorly (~ 30%) in contrast to Gly815Val that rendered GFP synthesis similar to wild-type. Furthermore, upstream to \u2018Gly\u2019 triad, while the Asn806Ala mutant retained RNA replication by approximately 65% compared to wild-type, Asn809Ala and His812Leu mutants showed non-viability (Fig. 4). This strongly suggested the essentiality of \u2018Asn809, His812, Gly816 and Gly817\u2019 residues in X-domain activity in virus replication that together with \u2018Asn806 and Gly815\u2019 could potentially form the putative Appr-1\u2033-pase active-site.",

            "text": "This prediction (of putative HEV Appr-1\u2033-pase active-site) was further tested experimentally using the pSK-GFP (viral full-length genomic replicon)/S10-3 culture system. In the present study, the replicon contained GFP reporter gene in place of HEV ORF2 coding sequences that could allow monitoring of viral RNA replication (Emerson et al., 2004). In our RNA transfections, ~ 50\u201360% cells show GFP-positivity with wild-type replicon compared to mock or Gly816Val/Gly817Val mutant-transfected GFP-negative cells (fluorescence microscopic observations). All a.a. mutant replicons were therefore, compared with controls for their replication fitness or viability by FACS scoring of GFP-positive/negative cells. In TGEV, papain-like protease 1(PL1pro) was shown to cleave the polyproteins (nsp2/nsp3) at Gly879\u2013Gly880 within the \u2018Gly878\u2013Gly879\u2013Gly880\u2019 triad of the downstream X-domain that had an Appr-1\u2033-pase activity, too (Putics et al., 2006). Likewise, downstream to its protease domain, RUBV polyprotein cleavage-substrate Gly1300\u2013Gly1301 within the X-domain \u2018Gly1299\u2013Gly1300\u2013Gly1301\u2019 triad has been characterized (Chen et al., 1996). In line with this, I have previously demonstrated the indispensability of ORF1 X-domain Gly816\u2013Gly817 residues in the conserved \u2018Gly815\u2013Gly816\u2013Gly817\u2019 triad in HEV replication that was however, predicted as viral PCP cleavage-substrate (Parvez, 2013b). This is supported by the yeast macrodomain protein crystal structure (Allen et al., 2003) suggesting the viral \u2018Gly\u2019 triad's contribution in substrate-binding through main-chain atoms. Because the HEV X-domain Gly\n \u2192 \nVal (larger, branched side-chain) mutants had already been characterized (Parvez, 2013b), in the present study, the three \u2018Gly\u2019 were substituted with small side-chain residue \u2018Ala\u2019. Thus, the three \u2018Gly\n \u2192 \nAla\u2019 mutant replicons were analyzed along with their \u2018Gly\n \u2192 \nVal\u2019 counterparts to see their differential effects, if any, on HEV RNA replication. FACS analysis of transfected cells revealed that \u2018Gly816Ala and Gly817Ala\u2019 completely abrogated RNA replication, similar to \u2018Gly816Val and Gly817Val\u2019, respectively. However, \u2018Ala\u2019 mutant of \u2018Gly815\u2019 produced very little GFP, in contrast to its \u2018Val\u2019 counterpart that completely abolished GFP synthesis. This was in absolute agreement with RUBV X-domain \u2018Gly1299\u2013Gly1300\u2013Gly1301\u2019 triad where the second and third \u2018Gly\u2019 when substituted to either \u2018Val\u2019 or \u2018Ala\u2019 produced non-viable replicons in cultured cells (Chen et al., 1996). In a biochemical study, Putics et al. (2005) showed that the \u2018Gly\n \u2192 \nVal\u2019 substitutions reduced the CoV X-domain associated Appr-1\u2033-pase activities more strongly than the corresponding \u2018Gly\n \u2192 \nAla\u2019 changes. Importantly, while the \u2018Gly\u2019 triad is conserved in most CoVs, the TGEV and feline CoV (FCoV) analogs have Met and Val, respectively at the first place (Fig. 1B), and substitution of the second or third \u2018Gly\u2019 dramatically changes the X-domain structure. This strongly supports the essentiality of \u2018Gly816 and Gly817\u2019 residues in HEV X-domain activity and virus replication.",

In this study, while the HEV Asn806Ala mutant replicated to 2/3rd efficiency, Asn809Ala and His812Leu mutants completely abolished RNA replication. This was in conformity with HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV X-domain catalytic center residues where the second \u2018Asn\u2019 was reported essential for Appr-1\u2033-pase activity (Karras et al., 2005, Putics et al., 2005). Notably, in a sequential mutation analysis, the dispensability of X-domain nucleotides (nos. 2396\u20132910) in virus replication at transcriptional level has been clearly demonstrated (Parvez, 2013b). Taken together, the present data therefore, strongly argue for an essential role of X-domain a.a. residues (Asn809, His812, Gly816, and Gly817) at post-translational level, indicating its enzymatic (most likely, Appr-1\u2033-pase) activity in HEV life cycle.",

And interestingly, while the animal CoV, HCoV-229E X-domain was shown to bind ADP-ribose in vitro, its homolog of avian CoV, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) failed to do so despite structural similarity (Piotrowski et al., 2009). An explanation for this could be the host/substrate-specific activity of Appr-1\u2033-pase that might provide a selective advantage in viral replication or/and modulation of host-factors during natural infection. In conclusion, the regulatory/catalytic role of ORF1 X-domain in HEV life cycle critically depends on \u2018Asn806, Asn809, His812, Gly815, Gly816, Gly817\u2019 sequences/secondary structure elements that could be further modulated by the upstream PCP/P-domain. Nevertheless, biochemical or biophysical characterization of ORF1 X-domain associated Appr-1\u2033-pase activity, including identification of relevant substrate(s) and their significance in virus or/and host remains inconclusive.",
