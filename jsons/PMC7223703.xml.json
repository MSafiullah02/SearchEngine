Within the context of intensive care settings, research has focused on the association between suctioning and the prevention of adverse events, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia [4\u20137]. Day et al. (2002) conducted a literature review and identified three phases of suctioning [8]. The first, pre-suctioning, phase, includes patient assessment, preparation, pre-oxygenation, and infection control, with a focus on evaluating the potential for adverse events. During the second, suctioning, phase, catheter selection, catheter insertion depth, negative pressure, suction duration, and number of suctioning passes are important assessment points considered. In the third, post-suctioning, phase, reconnection to oxygen therapy, patient assessment, reduction of patient stress and anxiety, appropriate titration of oxygen, and again, infection control, are related to the quality of care. The quality of suctioning skills is an important factor to consider, having been associated to complications, including respiratory infection, atelectasis, hypoxemia, and cardiovascular instability [9, 10]. However, to our knowledge, the association between the biomechanics of the suctioning manoeuvre and the amount of secretions suctioned has not been specifically evaluated.",

            "text": "For this study, a new tracheal suctioning simulator was specifically developed. The simulator consists of a mannequin with a styrofoam head and neck, with metal braces used to form the thorax (Fig. 1a). A cuff-less tracheotomy cannula (inner diameter: 8 mm, Koken Co., Japan) was inserted at the approximate level of the second to fourth tracheal cartilages of the neck. In addition, an acrylic pipe (14 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter) was used to imitate the trachea and the main bronchus of an adult patient [15]. A gravimetric digital scale was located at the tip of the cannula to quantify the amount of phlegm suctioned. The scale was placed under the acrylic pipe and attached to it using a custom three-dimensional printer fixture (Fig. 1b). The angle between the pharyngeal axis and the laryngeal axis in the sagittal plane was set to approximately 7\u00b0, which is the normal angle for an adult patient in the supine position, with the tracheal bifurcation inclined to lie below the pharyngeal axis, as per a previous report [16]. The inner surface of the acrylic pipe was coated with a soft urethane gel that closely mimicked the real trachea. The distance between the tip of the tracheal tube and the acrylic pipe was adjusted to pass the catheter into the pipe. The outside diameter of the suctioning catheter was set to 4 mm (12F, Nipro Co., Japan), which was approximately half of the insider diameter of the tracheal tube (#3276, Koken Co.). The viscosity of the simulated phlegm was realistic at 21.64 mPa\u30fbs (11229-070, Kyoto Kagaku Co., Japan). The temperature and humidity of the room were maintained at 24 \u00b0C and 35%\u201345% to maintain the appropriate viscosity of the simulated phlegm within the simulated endotracheal tube. Prior to the experiment, 10 g of simulated phlegm were placed into the pipe and evenly distributed within the pipe before suctioning. The thorax of the simulator was covered with a cloth so that it was not visible to the participants.",

No instructions were provided regarding the suctioning manoeuvre to be used. A few practice trials were performed to allow participants to practice completing the suctioning within the required 10 s.

The maximum length of the catheter inserted (Lmax) and suctioning time (within the 10-s period) were measured from the video data time synchronised to motion capture. For analysis, suctioning was sub-divided into two phases, namely, the insertion phase (T0\u2013T1) and the withdrawal phase (T1\u2013T2). The start of the insertion phase (T0) was defined as the time point when the catheter tip reached the opening of tracheal tube, and the end of the insertion phase (T1) as the time point when the tip of the catheter reached Lmax. The end of the withdrawal phase (T2) was defined as the time point when the tip of the catheter reached the opening of the tracheal tube. The amount of phlegm suctioned was calculated as the change in weight, using the digital scale placed inside the tube. For analysis, the amount of phlegm was normalised by the suctioning time (g/s). The biomechanics of the suctioning manoeuvre were defined using the total vertical length of the path of motion of the marker placed on the head of the second metacarpal of the dominant hand relative to the radial styloid process, which defined the path of wrist motion. The vertical motion of the forearm was calculated from the total vertical length of the path of motion of the marker placed on the radial styloid process of the dominant hand. These path lengths were normalised using the suctioning time to yield the total vertical path length per 10 s. The mean angular velocity of the tip of the thumb of the dominant hand was also calculated in the horizontal plane during the suctioning manoeuvre.",

The greater distal movement (of the hand and wrist) by experts could enhance control and, thus, performance skill of the suctioning manoeuvre. However, the absence of a difference in the angular motion of the thumb between the two groups likely reflects the condition of our simulated suctioning task, with the position of the phlegm being similar in each trial and, therefore, not requiring instantaneous changes in movement to adapt to unexpected conditions. The quasi-invariant condition of our task might explain differences between the biomechanical characteristics of expert and novice performance observed in the present study and those described in previous studies. Takayasu et al. (2019) reported differences in the motion of the proximal joints of the arm (the shoulder and elbow) and not the distal joints (wrist and fingers) between experts and novices during laparoscopic suturing manoeuvres [12], while Uemura et al.

Tracheal catheters have three holes, one located at the tip and two located on either side of the catheter, the first located at 7\u201311 mm from the tip of the catheter and the second at 16\u201320 mm from the tip, each hole having a length of 4 mm and a width of 1 mm. These two holes on either side of the catheter prevent excessive negative pressure, and contribute to the suction of secretions [17]. Therefore, the combination of linear and rotational movement of the catheter reduces the risk of suction-induced bleeding, and increases the likelihood of contact with phlegm located on the wall of the trachea.",

Second, the viscosity of the simulated phlegm may have required greater negative pressure for suction than that generally required in real situations. Third, the motion of the catheter was not directly measured, and the effectiveness of the side holes in increasing the amount of phlegm suctioned in the relatively short duration of our experimental set-up (10 s) could not be assessed. Therefore, further studies should be performed by considering the effects of phlegm viscosity, level of negative pressure, and the role of the side holes to further determine effective manoeuvres for safe tracheal suctioning. With regards to the simulator, including the sounds associated with phlegm suctioning, which provides important feedback, should be considered to more appropriately approximate the suctioning of patients in clinical settings.",
