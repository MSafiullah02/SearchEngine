            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an infectious disease which occurred firstly in the Guangdong province, southern part of China, in November 2002, caused outbreaks in 29 countries and areas in spring 2003 with 8098 clinical cases and 774 deaths, resulting in an overall mortality rate of 9.6% (WHO, 2003b). After the outbreaks were contained in mid-July 2003, three events of laboratory-associated infections caused a total of 11 clinical SARS cases (Normile and Vogel, 2003, Normile, 2004a, Normile, 2004b). Again in Guangdong, four clinical SARS cases occurred sporadically without contact histories from December 16, 2003 to January 8, 2004 (Liang et al., 2004). On the other hand, the origin of the etiological agent of SARS, SARS-CoV (Peiris et al., 2003), remains elusive although SARS-CoV-like virus was isolated from civet cats (Guan et al., 2003). The fact that 11 initial clinical SARS cases occurred independently without any contact history in different areas of Guangdong and the findings that the viral sequences isolated from these patients were grouped in different subtype clusters (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004) suggest that the patients in China were infected by SARS-CoV from multiple infectious sources, rather than from a single source. Therefore, SARS may be recurrent in human beings.",

The viral genome is approximately 30 kb in length with 11 open reading frames. SARS-CoV contains four major structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), small envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to cellular receptors (Li et al., 2003b) and virus entry by fusion with cell membranes (Hofmann et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004). Both M and E proteins are integral membrane proteins and form the minimum protein units for virus assembly. The N protein is an extensively phosphorylated, highly basic protein, which interacts with viral RNA and makes up the viral core and nucleocapsid (Lai, 2003).",

Currently, the diagnosis of SARS depends basically upon detecting SARS-CoV RNA by RT-PCR and/or testing specific antibodies directed against SARS-CoV by assays based on cultured virus or recombinant viral antigens. Although RT-PCR is a reliable technique for the diagnosis of SARS in the early phase, the detection rate for probable SARS was only 37.5\u201350% (Tang et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2004). Antibodies directed against SARS-CoV, examined by immunofluorescent assay, immunochromatographic test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), or Western blot, can detect over 90% of the cases (Wu et al., 2004, Guan et al., 2004, He et al., 2004a, Li et al., 2003a), however, it takes 2\u20133 weeks after the onset for the measurable specific antibodies to develop.

After five washes, 100 \u03bcl/well of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-SARS-CoV polyclonal antibodies (Beijing Weixiao Biotech) diluted 400-fold in PBS-T was added and again incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. After five washes, 100 \u03bcl/well of chemiluminescence substrate solution was added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the relative luminescence value (RLV) was read by the microplates single photon counter (Beijing Weixiao Biotech). The cut-off value was 2.1 times of the mean RLV of negative controls.",

In chickens infected experimentally with coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus, the N protein also lasts longer than the virus in tracheal smears and sliced tracheas (Yagyu and Ohta, 1990). This is likely because the N protein is not as degraded easily as viral RNA in the circulation since the N protein, when expressed in mammalian cells, can self-interact to form dimers or oligomers (He et al., 2004b), which may stabilize its helical structure. Therefore, the ECLIA for the N protein can detect the viral maker in SARS patients in whom RT-PCR shows negative.",
