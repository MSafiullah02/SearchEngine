This is a very timely issue, due to the pandemic of COVID-19 we are unfortunately living. Apps for contact tracing aim to detect proximity of users and to evaluate the related risk in terms of possible contagious. Existing approaches leverage Bluetooth or GPS, or their combination, even though the prevailing approach is Bluetoothbased and relies on a decentralized model requiring the mutual exchange of ephemeral identifiers among users' smartphones. Unfortunately, a number of security and privacy concerns exist in this kind of solutions, mainly due to the exchange of identifiers, while GPS-based solutions (inherently centralized) may suffer from threats concerning massive surveillance. In this paper, we propose a solution leveraging GPS to detect proximity, and Bluetooth only to improve accuracy, without enabling exchange of identifiers. Unlike related existing solutions, no complex cryptographic mechanism is adopted, while ensuring that the server does not learn anything about locations of users.",

The basic way to implement a GPS-based solution requires that the user's absolute position is periodically transmitted to a server (under the control of the government), which is then able to maintain the graph of contacts, possibly in form of pseudonyms. One of the advantages of the centralized model is that identities are not exchanged among users, and this disarm a number of possible issues arising from the possible misbehaviour of users. However, as recently stated by EU [9], GPS-based solutions introduce intolerable risks threatening fundamental rights of people, if implemented as above, in the general case that the server cannot be assumed fully trusted and positions of user are stored or potentially inferred.",

The latter consists in identifying the maximum number of persons potentially infected by a given patient detected as positive to the infection, in a suitable contagious temporal (past) window. Which kind of contact makes a person potentially infected and how long the contagious window is, strictly depend on the type of infection. The pandemic of COVID-2019 we are leaving in this period is characterized by high contagiousness mainly due to asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections, during a large temporal window (at least 14 days) [1] . Therefore, traditional contact tracing based on human intelligence activities to identify contacts is not sufficient if not supported by digital solutions able to capture even short (numerous) contacts occurred during the activities of daily life [2] . For this reason, there is nowadays a great attention towards digital contact tracing that many countries in the world are adopting through mobile apps to better manage the after-lock-down phase.",

Several solutions opt for a decentralized approach (such as DP-3T and the Apple and Google Exposure Notification System) [6] to guarantee high privacy properties. Among the decentralized models, the emerging model is certainly the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T) [4] and, therefore, the DP-3T based solutions. This model is based on ephemeral pseudonyms (called EphID) sent via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which are registered by nearby users. We will see more carefully this model in the next section. In the spirit of collaboration, Google and Apple announced a joint effort for a new Bluetooth protocol that preserves privacy to support Exposure Notification [5] and which will follow the DP-3T principles. Avitabile et al. [6] unveiled Pronto-C2, a decentralized tracking system that is based on BLE and appears to be more resistant than DP-3T against mass surveillance attacks. This system can be implemented through government servers but it can also be completely decentralized by using blockchain technology. CAUDHT is a decentralized system based on Distributed Hash Tables [13] . The entities involved are users, a distributed hash table (DHT), and the Health Authority (HA), which has the role of confirmation of positive cases. Another decentralized protocol based on Bluetooth is TCN (Temporary Contact Numbers) [14] . To solve the problem of scalability, the protocol switches from purely random TCNs to TCNs generated deterministically from some seed data. The price it pays for greater scalability is a reduction in privacy because the TCNs derived from the same report can be linked together.",

Centralization has the advantage of providing epidemiologists with more useful data, thus allowing more effective actions to be taken to defeat the virus, but some scholars fear that these systems could become a more intrusive massive surveillance tool for governments [8] . PEPP-PT NTK is a proximity tracing system, based on Bluetooth Low Energy [16] . Just like DP-3T, NTK and ROBERT are based on ephemeral pseudonyms sent via BLE that are registered by nearby users, with the difference that the secret keys for calculating EphIDs are created and managed by a back-end server and not from the user's phone [17] . Moreover, DP-3T, NTK, and ROBERT require a central backend for their operation in which epidemiological data is stored. The Altuwaiyan et al. model, called EPIC, [18] is always based on Bluetooth technology, and offers a fine-grained human-to-human contact tracing scheme with hybrid wireless and localization technology. EPIC introduces a matching method which uses homomorphic encryption to match common wireless devices between the infected and the regular user. However, the system can suffer from serious privacy losses and above all, it has scalability problems [12] .",

This approach involves two types of entities namely the Ministry of Health (MoH), which all users are assumed to trust, and users (who are not required to share everything with MoH if they have not been in close contact with a confirmed positive). This system manages to trace the COVID-19 transmission graph in the population that installed the app. However, solutions based on Bluetooth technology present several vulnerabilities [20] and have a slow and low adoption rate which therefore limits the user base adhering to the system [12] . Furthermore, these systems only consider the human-to-human interaction and therefore do not allow us to discover the place where an outbreak has developed as it is not possible to know the user's position. The side effect is that such solutions ignore the fact that the COVID-19 can also be transmitted through common environments or commonly touched surfaces [21] (indirect contacts).

If a user finds out that she/he is positive for COVID-19 then, after obtaining the approval of the health authority, may upload some anonymous data from her/his smartphone to a central server. Before uploading, all data remains exclusively on the user's smartphone. The DP-3T model provides two decentralized proximity tracing designs: the first, defined as low-cost, is a lightweight system at the cost of limited tracing of infected patients, the second, defined as unlinkable, offers extra privacy properties with a small increase in bandwidth. The first solution reveals minimal information to the back-end server. Each smartphone generates an initial random initial daily key SKt for the current day t and, every day rotates the secret day key SKt by calculating SKt = H(SKt\u22121), where H is a cryptographic hash function. Each smartphone uses the secret key SKt during the day t to locally generate a list of ephemeral identifiers (EphID)s that change frequently (every epoch with length l). Therefore, at the beginning of each day t, each smartphone generates locally a list of n = (24 \u00b7 60)/l new EphIDis to be transmitted during the day t. Given the secret day key SKt, each device calculates EphID1||...||EphIDn = P RG(P RF (SKt, broadcastkey)), where PRG is a stream cipher, PRF is a pseudo-random function, and broadcast key is a fixed and public string. The EphIDis are transmitted in random order and each EphID is transmitted for l minutes. The EphIDs are broadcasted via Bluetooth Low Energy announcements (the system relies on BLE beacons, whose payload is of 16 bytes, which technically limits the size of the EphIDs). These EphIDs are then locally stored (together with the corresponding proximity, the duration and an approximate indication of the time) by the other nearby smartphones. Each smartphone stores the SK keys it has generated in the last 14 days and the same happens for all the data and the EphIDs observed and generated. A user who tested positive, only after obtaining authorization from the health authority, may send to the back-end the key SKt and the day t corresponding to the first day on which it was considered contagious. The back-end collects the pairs (SKt, t) of the infected patients and periodically sends them to all the other smartphones in the system. Given the key SKt, everyone can calculate all the ephemeral identifiers EphIDs used by the infected patient starting from the corresponding day t. The device determines the owner's risk score using the risk-scoring algorithm with its local records corresponding to the infectious EphID.",

            "text": "The second solution, defined as unlinkable, offers better privacy properties at the cost of a greater volume of downloads and storage space required by the smartphone. The ephemeral identifiers of positive individuals are hashed and stored in a Cuckoo filter [23] , which is distributed to the users of the system. The smartphone draws a random 32-byte per-epoch seed (seedi) and generate the ephemeral Bluetooth identifier EphIDi for each epoch i: EphIDi = T RU N CAT E128(H(seedi)), where H is a cryptographic hash function, and T RU N CAT E128 truncates the output to 128 bits. Smartphones store the seeds corresponding to all past epochs in the last 14 days. For each observed EphID, the smartphone stores the hashed string H(EphID||i), the proximity, the duration, and an approximate indication of the time. Unlike the previous solution, when a user tested positive, she/he can choose the set of epochs I for which she/he wants to reveal her/his identifiers, that is, she/he can selectively decide which identifiers she/he wants to communicate to the server. After making this decision, the smartphone loads the set of pairs (i, seedi). Periodically, the back-end creates a new Cuckoo filter F and, for each pair (i, seedi) loaded by an infected user, inserts H(T RU N CAT E128(H(seedi))||i) into the Cuckoo filter F and sends this filter to all the smartphones in the system. Each smartphone uses this filter to determine whether the user has been in contact with an infected person. DP-3T suffers from several attacks that can compromise user privacy and potentially lead to undergo undetectable mass surveillance attacks [6] . Some attacks may have the purpose of building a mass surveillance infrastructure to track citizens both in the case of trusted servers and in the case of colluding server (Paparazzi and Orwell attack, respectively). Another attack could aim to create a mapping between a user's real identity and her/his pseudonym (Brutus Attack). Another goal of an attack is to produce plausible digital evidence of an encounter with an infected user (Gossip Attack). An attacker could also produce false alarms so that non-at-risk user is mistakenly alerted and declared positive (Matteotti Attack). The attacks mentioned here will be thoroughly described in Section 6, but we introduce this issue here because it is the consideration from which we start as a motivation of our paper. In fact, our paper tries to offer a new declination of the centralized model overcoming the security and privacy drawbacks of DP-3T, without introducing risks usually associated with centralized digital contact tracing at feasible computational cost for the server.

At the end of this protocol, Ux obtains the correct pair (\u03c1x, \u03b8x). Note that no pseudo-identifier of Ux is exchanged in the negotiation protocol. Unlike classic BLE-based solutions, Bluetooth is used only to improve the accuracy of GPS. Moreover, another advantage of integrate Bluetooth in our solution is the following. In tradition GPS based solutions, when two users are close but separated by an obstacle, for example a wall, the server is not aware about this and registers a contact even if it does not happen. By using Bluetooth, the presence of the obstacle attenuates the signal and the contact is not captured by the smartphone.",

As discussed in Section 6, blind signature also avoids that, even though S colludes with HF, it is not able to link all the randoms of Uz to her/his real identity. The procedure is the following. First, Uz generates a random A of 1024-256= 768 bits and obtains M = A||h(A) where h(A) is the application of a cryptographic hash function with digests of 256 bits (e.g., SHA-256). At this point, Uz contacts HF to obtain the RSA blind signature on M . Let denote by P the message with blind signature. Uz unblinds P and obtains the signature of HF \u03c3(M ) of M . Finally, Uz sends to S \u03c3(M ) and all the randoms Rzs she/he generated. S verifies the signature and checks that M = A||h(A). In the positive case, S searches all the contact burst including any of the randoms Rzs as first or second component. For each of these entries, S sends in broadcast a pair containing the other random (i.e., the random generated by a user which is came into contact with Uz) and the partial risk level.",

This protocol involved pairs of users and is named PNP, which stands for position negotiation protocol. We say that a user is locked if she/he has executed PNP with another user, otherwise she/he is unlocked. Consider an unlocked user Ux which enters in the action range of Bluetooth with a group G of other users. For each locked user Uy in G with polar coordinates (\u03c1y, \u03b8y), Ux retrieves such coordinates through Bluetooth. Since Uy is locked, (\u03c1y, \u03b8y) are already adjusted. On the other hand, the polar coordinates of Ux, (\u03c1x, \u03b8x), which are obtained through GPS, should be adjusted. To accomplish this, Ux computes the distance dGP S = \u03c1x 2 + \u03c1y 2 \u2212 2\u03c1x\u03c1ycos(\u03b8x \u2212 \u03b8y) obtained by considering the nonadjusted coordinates of Ux. Then, Ux, as typically done on the basis of the signal power, computes again the distance with Uy. We denote by d Bl such a distance and assume it represents a more accurate estimate of dGP S . Finally, among all (locked) users, Ux chooses one of the users U k such that |r| = |dGP S \u2212 dBl| is minimum, that is the user U k minimizing the error of GPS w.r.t. Bluetooth (which we can consider more accurate). If we denote by (\u03c1 k , \u03b8 k ) the coordinates of U k , the new coordinates of Ux, (\u03c1 x , \u03b8 x ), are obtained by moving the old coordinates by |r| along the straight line passing between (\u03c1 k , \u03b8 k ) and (\u03c1x, \u03b8x) so that the new distance between Ux and U k is equal to d Bl , as depicted in Figure 3 . After this process, Ux is locked. If no locked user exists in the action range of Bluetooth, for each (unlocked) user Uy, Ux computes dGP S , d Bl and r, defined as above, and chooses a user U k with minimum value |r|. This time, both Ux and U k update their coordinates, by moving them by |r|/2 along the straight line passing between (\u03c1 k , \u03b8 k ) and (\u03c1x, \u03b8x) so that the new distance between Ux and U k is equal to d Bl . After this process, both Ux and Uz are locked.",

            "text": "We highlight that many attacks are due to the exchange of the ephemeral identifiers among the users through Bluetooth. In our solution, no random is exchanged. Paparazzi Attack [6] . The attack aims to trace infected users by linking their ephemeral identifiers. We assume the server is trusted. This attack works only with the low-cost design of DP-3T. First, the attacker installs several passive BLE devices through the territory in order to collect the ephemeral identifiers of other users located in proximity of such devices. Moreover, it records the time and the location where such identifiers are received and, possibly, other information about the users. When a user Ux results infected, she/he sends her/his secret key SK to the server S which, in turn, broadcasts it to all the users. Starting from SK, the attacker is able to generate all the ephemeral identifiers of Ux and to track her/him through the information (time, location, etc.) stored when Ux passed in proximity of the passive devices. Clearly, this attack does not work on the unlinkable design of DP-3T since the infected user Ux sends the seeds to generate the ephemeral identifiers to the server S, but this latter does not broadcast such seeds to all users. Instead, S generates all the ephemeral identifiers of Ux and adds them to the Cuckoo filter, so that the attacker cannot link them. Similarly, also ZE2-P3T does not suffer of this kind of attack since the ephemeral identifiers, that are represented by the randoms generated by the users, are not exchanged, but are sent directly to the server. Since the server is trusted, the attack cannot be performed. Orwell Attack [6] . The objective is the same as Paparazzi attack, but with the difference that the attacker colludes with the server S. Clearly, this time, also the unlinkable design of DP-3T is vulnerable to the attack since the server S knows the seeds of the infected users and can easily link their ephemeral identifiers. We claim that, although, in principle, such an attack is possible in ZE2-P3T, it is definitely harder and less effective than in DP-3T. In fact, in order to know the randoms of users coming from a specific microcell, S needs to know the random RP sent by TSP in that microcell. Since S does not collude with TSP, the only way to obtain RP is to collaborate with a partner located in the area whenever RP is sent by TSP. To put on a mass tracking system, the attacker (colluding with the server) must have many partners spread throughout the territory and each one of them has to be registered with TSP to obtain RP . Clearly, this is more onerous that to install passive BLE devices. Moreover, our solution includes in general a certain level of uncertainty, whenever more than one user belongs to a microcell simultaneously. Brutus attack. In this attack, the health facility HF and the server S collude to identify the mapping between pseudonymous and real identities of infected users. It is an exploit of the authorization mechanism with which infected users communicate their status to S. DP-3T (both the designs) proposes three different authorization mechanisms but they are, essentially, based on an authorization code released by HF. Clearly, HF knows the identity of the infected user and if it colludes with S, then it may provide to S the mapping between the real identity of a user and its authorization code. S can associate this identity with the ephemeral identifiers sent by the user. Both DP-3T designs are vulnerable to this attack. In ZE2-P3T, the authorization code is replaced by M which cannot be linked by HF to the message submitted by the user to obtain the signature, thanks to the blind signature mechanism. Thus, both HF and S cannot link M to the real identity of the user. In conclusion, ZE2-P3T is not vulnerable to Brutus attack. Gossip attack [6] . The objective of this attack is to provide an evidence about an encounter with an infected user before the discovering of her/him positiveness to the infection. It can be view as a security flaw because it is a misuse of the system for an unintended scope, potentially threatening privacy and exploitable for disputes. In both the designs (low-cost and unlinkable) of DP-3T, when the attacker captures the ephemeral identifiers of other users, she/he could, for example, store them on blockchain and, successively, demonstrate to have encountered such users. In ZE2-P3T, this attack is not possible since users do not exchange any random. Matteotti attack [6] . In this attack, the objective is to deceive a user by providing her/him a fake contact with a positive user. The result aimed by the attacker is to damage the victim enforcing her/him quarantine (or other consequent actions). It requires the collusion of the attacker with the server. Suppose Uv is the user victim of the attack. In the unlinkable design of DP-3T, the attacker places the BLE passive devices in proximity of Uv and when this latter comes into contact with another user Us, the passive devices capture the ephemeral identifiers of Us and send them to the server. The server inserts such identifiers in the Cuckoo filter so that, when Uv checks the filter, she/he is wrongly alerted. Low Cost DP-3T is not vulnerable to this attack since the server is not able to generate the secret keys of the users starting from the collected ephemeral identifiers. Similarly to the unlinkable DP-3T, in ZE2-P3T, the server can notify false information about the contacts at risk.",

Therefore, the attack would succeed if the server is able to identify such centroid. The user sends h(Ci||RP ) and, even if the total number of centroids is not too large, the presence of the random RP makes dictionary-based attacks unfeasible.
