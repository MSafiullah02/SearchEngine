With the rapid impact of COVID-19, several research groups have begun exploring statistical and mathematical models to study the spread of the disease. One of the early studies using AI [2] identified the global spread of the disease through commercial airlines, if the outbreak continues. There are several inefficiencies with the current data available for COVID-19 research, such as limited testing capabilities and high variability within the testing rate (e.g.: 22 .08/1000 in Italy, 11.16/1000 in US, to 0.27/1000 in India [3, 4] ), inconsistencies in reporting (under reporting), and publicly available data on infection rates currently are unreliable. Particularly lacking is an understanding of the underlying factors which impact the spread, accuracy and availability of reported cases on a small scale, and quantifiable metrics for how social distancing and quarantine efforts impact the spread. To overcome these challenges in providing early models for forecasting the spread of COVID-19, we combine compartmentalized models with a data-driven machine learning approach. In doing so, we address a potential pitfall of machine learning (ensuring compliance with the laws of epidemic dynamics) and a limitation of epidemiological models (enabling the creation of complex mappings from available data sources to critical modeling parameters).",

Figure 3 shows the fit for predicting total cases in a region based on mobility data compared to the ground truth in several countries. Figures 4 and 5 show the models forecast for different mobility levels in each country for active cases and total cases respectively. These figures demonstrate that the proposed SIRNET is able to fit the case count by region well using mobility information to determine the contact rate of an SEIR cell. Based on the projected forecasts, we observe that a continuation of quarantine level mobility will result low case counts. If the mobility restrictions are reduced to 50% nominal mobility, the model shows that this is near the edge of stable peak cases where in some scenarios the curve stays at a low peak, while for others the peak increases drastically compared to the quarantined mobility and occurs much later. The third scenario is 75% nominal mobility which based on the model is expected to result in a slightly delayed peak approximately 2/3 the maximum peak during normal mobility. The exception is South Korea, where at this stage even a return to 75% mobility is not expected to result in a second wave. A zoomed in figure of the forecast of active cases in the US is shown in Figure 6 to better illustrate the difference between mobility levels. In general, these results suggest a continuation of quarantine level mobility or at least below 50% nominal mobility for the immediate future. Figure 7 shows the model fit with ground truth for the top 28 counties in Texas. In general the model fits well where the case counts are higher than 50 and as data becomes richer, the fit improves significantly. Figure 8 highlights a sample of the mobility trends used in all our simulations. It is important to note that this data reflects a sample space of mobility for the region and might be missing information on key populations that do not use specific types of devices.",

First, heavy mobility restrictions can drive the contact rate and reproduction number down so that the virus is eliminated from the population.

RNNs have the ability to learn patterns from arbitrarily long spatiotemporal data, through cyclic connection of nodes in the network[31]. An LSTM cell, a type of RNN, addresses some of the shortcomings in vanilla RNNs, such as vanishing or exploding parameters by adding memory[32].
