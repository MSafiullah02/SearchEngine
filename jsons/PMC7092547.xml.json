            "text": "Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative, halophilic bacterium that inhabits marine and estuarine environments. Since its discovery in 1950 as the causative agent of gastroenteritis in Japan [1], V. parahaemolyticus has become one of the leading causes of food-borne illness in humans. Infection is closely associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood, resulting in self-limiting diarrhoea [2]. Rarely, V. parahaemolyticus also causes wound infections and septicaemia [2]. The virulence of V. parahaemolyticus is associated with the production of thermostable-direct haemolysin (TDH) (encoded by tdh gene) and/or TDH-related haemolysin (TRH, encoded by trh gene) as well as two type III secretion systems (T3SS) [3\u20135]. Two sets of the genes T3SS1 and T3SS2 are present on chromosomes 1 and 2, respectively [5].",

The pandemic clone has the typical tdh+trh\u2212, toxRS/new+, orf8+/\u2212 genotype, which is identified by Group-specific PCR (GS-PCR) that detects the sequence variation in toxRS gene (toxRS/new) [14, 15]. The burden of V. parahaemolyticus diarrhoea is very high in Asian countries [16\u201318] and the outbreaks are related to raw shellfish consumption in the United States and Canada [19, 20]. In addition, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in coastal Europe [21, 22]. Although the pandemic strains are still prevalent in diarrhoeal cases in India [23], there is a paucity of information on V. parahaemolyticus from different environmental sources.",

This release indicated the degree to which the integrity of host cell membrane was compromised. Only two clinical isolates, AP11243 (tdh+trh\u2212) and ATCC17802 (tdh\u2212trh+) were highly cytotoxic to Caco-2 cells (94% and 93%, respectively) while the reference strain RIMD2210633 showed a mean cytotoxicity of 8% (Fig. 2a). Among tdh+trh\u2212 seafood isolates, H10 and H12 showed good cytotoxicity (43% and 34%, respectively), whereas the isolate H14 was cytotoxic to 85% of cells, almost comparable to that of AP11243. The tdh\u2212trh+ isolate K23 that had a fully functional T3SS exhibited low cytotoxic activity (15%). Very low cytotoxic activity, ranging from 6 to 17%, was shown by the four non-toxigenic isolates. However, when compared, the results between clinical, environmental toxigenic and non-toxigenic isolates were not statistically significant (p > 0.05, one-way ANOVA). A time course analysis of LDH release by tdh+trh\u2212 H14 and tdh\u2212trh+ K23 was done up to 6 h post-infection. There was a constant increase in cytotoxicity for H14 with 100% cell lysis at 6 h while the cytotoxicity induced by K23 reached a peak at 4 h (15%) and slightly decreased thereafter (Fig. 2b).\n",

H14, and to a lesser extent, K23 rapidly proliferated inside Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3c). Peak numbers of H14 (450% of initial intracellular CFU) was observed in about 3 h. This number decreased rapidly and intracellular bacteria were still visible at 6 h of infection even though the levels were similar to that detected upon initial enumeration (~ 100%). Intracellular K23 also peaked at 3 h of infection, but the number of bacteria was lower (220% of initial intracellular cfu) and at the end of 6 h, the numbers declined. The decrease in intracellular bacteria could be attributed to the lysis of eukaryotic cells and subsequent killing in the gentamicin containing medium.

An abundance of V. parahaemolyticus was seen in the water compared to plankton. This was in contrast to other studies where higher densities of V. parahaemolyticus were obtained from plankton [26, 27]. However, higher numbers of the bacterium were found in the Georgian coastal waters [28]. More than 5% of the V. parahaemolyticus isolates were potentially toxigenic, based on the presence of tdh and trh, of which tdh was detected in a higher number of isolates (4.6%). Previous studies from the south-west coast of India have reported a higher detection of trh-positive V. parahaemolyticus especially after 18 h of enrichment [29, 30]. The toxigenic V. parahaemolyticus isolates obtained in this study were identified exclusively from seafood and none of the water and plankton isolates harboured the haemolysin genes. Hemolysin gene identification is partly dependent on the detection technique employed. The use of modified primers could recover 48 and 8% tdh and trh bearing isolates respectively from an estuarine system [31]. In another study, DePaola et al., tested a large number of colonies from oysters by DNA probes against tlh and tdh and found that 21.8% of them were pathogenic [6]. Similarly, real time PCR could detect 20 and 40% more tdh and trh positive V. parahaemolyticus from oyster samples and 13 and 40% from water samples compared to the conventional techniques [32]. Thus, detection of toxigenic V. parahaemolyticus from environmental samples appears to be influenced by several factors.",

All the toxigenic V. parahaemolyticus strains in this study carried the T3SS1 genes, consistent with previous reports [17, 33]. The distribution of T3SS2\u03b1 genes was highly diverse with the loss of at least one gene from the tdh+trh\u2212 isolates. Some of the isolates showed weak amplification with the T3SS2\u03b1 primer pair or additional primers designed. Jones et al. had also reported anomalies in the T3SS2\u03b1 gene amplification [33]. This suggests high sequence variability in environmental isolates or an absence of these genes due to partial uptake of VPaI during horizontal transfer. Further, vopB2 was present in 68.4% of tdh+trh\u2212 isolates in contrast to earlier findings that it is associated with clinical and not environmental isolates [33, 34]. Some recent reports have documented the presence of vopB2 in environmental isolates [35, 36]. Hence, vopB2 may not be a good indicator of virulence as originally suggested [34]. About 33% of tdh+trh\u2212 isolates harboured vopZ gene that encodes the effector, VopZ, known for V. parahaemolyticus induced diarrhoea and intestinal pathology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to document the presence of vopZ (VPA1336) in V. parahaemolyticus isolated from seafood.",

Of these, nine serovars (O1:K17, O1:K19, O1:K23, O10:K24, O2:KUT, O4:K29, O5:K20, O4:K42 and O4:K36) were newly identified with pandemic strain traits. Another striking observation is the appearance of tdh\u2212trh+ isolates carrying the toxRS/new+ pandemic marker. Pandemic strains of V. parahaemolyticus are mostly associated with the tdh gene with few reports of GS-positive trh-containing isolates from clinical cases [23, 37, 38]. Data pertaining to the pandemic status of environmental trh-positive V. parahaemolyticus is lacking. Thus, this study is the first to report the isolation of a new serovar (O4:K36) of tdh\u2212trh+V. parahaemolyticus from seafood with potential pandemic traits. Currently the pandemic group is defined by the presence of tdh and toxRS/new genes. So, the pandemic status and evolution of the three tdh\u2212trh+ isolates identified in this study should be confirmed employing other genetic markers including genomic islands VPaI-1, VPaI-4 and VPaI-5 that are specific for the pandemic group [39\u201341] as well as whole genome sequence analysis. Besides, our finding of tdh\u2212trh+ O3:KUT serovar and its recent isolation from acute diarrhoea in India [23] underscores better cognizance of an epidemiological association between environmental and clinical strains.",

The PFGE pattern of the 15 isolates of this study showed considerable diversity and the new serovars having pandemic attributes were not related to the pandemic O3:K6 isolate. Further, it was noted that strains with identical serotype and/or genotype had different PFGE profiles, as in the case of tdh+trh\u2212 isolates. Moreover, one of the O1:K25 isolate which was not positive in the GS-PCR, clustered along with the isolates having pandemic strain traits. A similar pattern was observed during molecular typing of V. parahemolyticus isolates in China, where seafood isolates having a varying combination of tdh, trh and toxRS/new genes clustered together with pandemic isolates whereas a tdh+trh\u2212, toxRS/new+ clinical isolate was not genetically related to the pandemic clones [44]. Comparison of MLST datasets of different bacterial species revealed environmental isolates of marine and estuarine V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus have very high homologous recombination rate as they frequently adapt for survival [45]. It was proposed that V. parahaemolyticus may have an epidemic population structure [46] where the isolates undergo frequent genetic recombination resulting in well-adapted clones [47]. Considering the increase in environmental strains acquiring virulence and pandemic attributes, it is important to know the genetics of this thriving population to reduce potential human health risk if newer virulent clones emerge.",

            "text": "To determine the pathogenic potential of environmental V. parahaemolyticus isolates, we used Caco-2 cell line assays. As an initial step, the transcriptional activity of the haemolysin and T3SS2 effector genes were analysed in the selected isolates. While all the clinical strains transcribed both the haemolysin genes, only trh gene was functional in the environmental isolates. The expression results were substantiated by low haemolytic activity of the environmental isolates on human RBC. It is shown that poor expression of tdh gene corresponds to two point mutations in the promoter region (substitution of A to G in the \u2212 35 sequence, G to A at \u2212 3 nucleotide position from the \u2212 10 sequence) [48, 49]. We presume that these mutations may be one of the reasons for the observed reduced transcription. Moreover, we found the isolates carried a single copy of tdh (Additional file 1: Figure S4), which is generally responsible for weak and intermediate haemolysis due a weak promoter compared to tdh2 [48]. The existence of a second copy of tdh or mutations in the promoter needs to be further determined. Similarly, the low haemolytic activity of clinical as well as environmental tdh\u2212trh+ isolates was not surprising as both contain the trh2 allele (Additional file 1: Figure S4), which exhibit reduced hemolysis, not due to reduced gene expression, rather, owing to the differences in the amino acid molecular conformation and binding capacity of RBC by the trh2 product [50, 51]. Further, the tdh-trh+ environmental isolate K23 transcribed the genes vopC, vopA and vopL encoding effectors that promote invasion and modulate host cell behaviour, making it a possible pathogen. A similar functional T3SS2\u03b2 was seen in trh-positive V. parahaemolyticus elsewhere in India [52].",

To begin with, we found all the isolates to be cytotoxic to Caco-2 cells without discernible differences in cytotoxicity between clinical and environmental isolates, as shown previously [53, 54]. Therefore, cytotoxicity may not be a reliable indicator of pathogenesis. It was also found that the ability to induce cytotoxicity was not dependent on the virulence genes tested. Interestingly, in the present investigation, the cytotoxicity of tdh\u2212trh+ isolate K23 was very low compared to its clinical counterpart with a similar genetic profile. It is well established that T3SSs are responsible for host cell cytotoxic damage, with T3SS1 being the dominant contributor [55]. Perhaps the isolate might have a varied architecture and integrity of T3SS1 gene cluster causing it to assemble a defective translocon and a reduced delivery of T3SS1 effectors responsible for cytotoxicity. It is also possible that the clinical strain might harbour some exclusive genes not present in environmental isolate genome that can induce cytotoxic damage. Meanwhile, the cytotoxicity of the isolates that do not harbour virulence genes was noteworthy. There may be other yet unidentified genes contributing to host cytotoxicty and isolate-specific variations in the virulence of V. parahaemolyticus.",

The ability of the representative tdh-positive (H14) and trh-positive (K23) isolates to invade was followed by survival and replication within the intracellular environment. Further, infection with H14 and K23 caused disruption of tight junctions and re-organisation of actin cytoskeleton, both of which can compromise the epithelial integrity. Recent research classifies V. parahaemolyticus as a facultative intracellular pathogen and T3SS2 effectors, VopC and VopL promote invasion and intracellular survival [56] in addition to inducing dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton along with VopV [57\u201359]. It was found that in spite of a functional vopC and a weakly transcribed vopL, H14 could still gain access to Caco-2 cell, persist inside and induce changes on tight junctions and actin cytoskeleton. Burdette et al. [60] showed that T3SS1 also causes changes in actin cytoskeleton. The effects seen with the environmental strains may be due to an active T3SS1 albeit the contribution of T3SS2 effectors cannot be ignored, especially with K23, which can emerge as a potential pathogen and elicit a full blown pathogenic response under a favorable environment of host intestine. Moreover, the study detected a non-toxigenic isolate, ME8, from estuarine water exhibiting an invasive phenotype. Perhaps it may be the result of high levels of adhesion rather than active invasion. Recent studies have identified tdh\u2212trh\u2212V. parahaemolyticus causing gastroenteritis [61\u201363], indicating the highly complex nature of the virulence of this pathogen.",

In vivo studies are required to confirm enterotoxicity of these strains; yet, the demonstrated effects on intestinal cell line indicate their enhanced virulence potential. Attributing pathogenic potential for environmental isolates is an important aspect of understanding health risks associated with seafood borne V. parahaemolyticus. Although there have been significant progress in the virulence of V. parahaemolyticus, our data clearly indicate the difficulty in discriminating pathogenic and non-pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus with the current set of virulence genes, particularly when various pathotypes exist.

For determining bacterial invasion, the infected monolayers were washed with PBS and further incubated for 1 h in DMEM containing 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) to kill the extracellular bacteria. After washing thrice, the monolayers were lysed and bacterial cells quantified.

The experiments were repeated three times and SEM was calculated. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and E. coli JM109 were used as positive and negative controls.
