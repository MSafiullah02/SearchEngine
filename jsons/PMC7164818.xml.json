Travel-associated cases or secondary transmission arising from such cases have been reported in Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia.2 Some case clusters have been associated with limited human-to-human transmission occurring within family or health-care settings, and the remaining sporadic cases are presumed to be zoonotic in origin.3, 4 A recent increase in reported cases from Saudi Arabia associated with health-care facilities is a particular cause of concern.3\n",

MERS-CoV has been detected in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), in association with and preceding human infection, and in dromedary slaughterhouses and farms.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Viruses from most of the recent human cases from the Arabian peninsula phylogenetically cluster within clade B, but the earliest human MERS-CoV strains from 2012 are genetically distinct and are denoted as clade A.10 Dromedary MERS-CoV strains detected in the Arabian peninsula in 2012\u201313 were clade B viruses, phylogenetically related to viruses from human cases from the same regions, but genetically diverse (non-clade A/B) viruses were reported from Egypt.11 Researchers have also reported serological evidence collected between 2009 and 2013 of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camel serum samples from Tunisia, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Egypt, suggesting that MERS-CoV or antigenically related viruses might be geographically more widespread than is appreciated at present.6, 12 Findings from two studies of 226 people in Saudi Arabia and 179 people in Egypt working in dromedary abattoirs showed that all remained seronegative for MERS-CoV, suggesting that transmission to humans is uncommon11, 13 and raising the question of whether dromedary MERS-CoV strains have the capacity to infect human beings. Full genome sequences of dromedary viruses suggest that these viruses are similar to viruses in humans.11, 14 There were some aminoacid differences between the human and dromedary viruses, including in the genetic sequence of the spike protein (a major determinant of host specificity), but they did not affect the receptor binding interface with the cell receptor DPP4.11, 14 However, because a single aminoacid change can profoundly affect host range and because the host range determinants of MERS-CoV are not well defined, dromedary viruses need to be phenotypically characterised in a physiologically relevant manner.15 So far, few virus isolates from dromedaries have been available for biological characterisation and direct evidence for replication competence of dromedary MERS-CoV in human respiratory tissues has been lacking. The only biological characterisation of a dromedary MERS-CoV virus so far was the finding of DPP4-receptor-dependent virus replication in Huh-7 cells,16 a transformed human hepatoma cell line physiologically unrelated to the human respiratory tract.",

The dromedary camel MERS-CoV isolates AH13 and AH19D had been isolated in Vero-E6 cells (ATCC, CRL-1586, Manassas, VA, USA) from nasal (AH13) and faecal (AH19D) swabs, collected from dromedaries in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, as previously described.14 The detection of dromedary camel MERS-CoV NRCE-HKU270 from a nasal swab of a dromedary in an abattoir in Egypt has been previously reported.11 For this study, we successfully isolated the virus from this specimen in Vero-E6 cells as previously described.14 Viruses were grown, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used.

Because of their three-dimensional nature, infection in ex-vivo cultures was non-uniform throughout the histological specimen (appendix). Figure 4\nshows viral replication kinetics of the viruses in the ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. In the absence of permissive cells, the thermal inactivation curves of each of these MERS-CoV strains showed virus infectivity largely decreasing to undetectable levels by 24 h post infection (figure 4A). We noted similar thermal inactivation kinetics when we substituted mouse lung tissue (non-permissive to MERS-CoV) for the human ex-vivo tissues (data not shown). Although the extent of virus replication varied from donor to donor, comparison with the thermal inactivation curves provided convincing evidence of virus replication of all four viruses in the ex-vivo human bronchial (figure 4B) and lung (figure 4C) cultures from each donor over the 72 h experiment period. Two replicates of ex-vivo cultures per donor from three donors, infected with the same virus (human MERS-CoV EMC) on different occasions, showed that the change of area-under-curve from the same tissue donor in bronchus ranged between 0 to 1\u00b736-fold and in lung ranged between 0 to 1\u00b746-fold, providing an indication of the range of technical variation in these ex-vivo assays (appendix). By contrast, the difference of area-under-curve for human MERS-CoV EMC between donor 3 and donor 1 was 5\u00b73-fold for the bronchus (area under curve above detection limit 112\u00b78 for donor 1 vs 21\u00b73 for donor 3) and 37\u00b73-fold for the lung ex-vivo cultures (178\u00b78 for donor 1 vs 4\u00b78 for donor 3), suggesting substantial donor-to-donor heterogeneity in virus replication competence (appendix). In view of the patchy nature of the infection, the variation between donors, and lack of adequate statistical power, statistical comparisons between viruses have to be interpreted with caution. Within these limitations, we noted no significant difference in the replication competence of the four viruses in either the bronchus (p=0\u00b7151) or the lung (p=0\u00b7270) as assessed by the area-under-the-curve using the Friedman test (appendix).",

One other recent paper not yet cited in PubMed was identified through search of the literature. Only one of these studies pertained to the phenotypic characterisation of dromedary MERS-CoV in cell cultures in vitro.16 This study used a transformed human hepatoma cell line, not physiologically relevant to the human respiratory tract.\nInterpretation\nOur findings show similar virus tropism and replication competence of human and dromedary MERS-CoV in ex-vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract. These findings suggest that dromedary MERS-CoV from the Arabian peninsula, in addition to genetically diverse dromedary viruses from Egypt, can be infectious to human beings. Exposure to zoonotic MERS-CoV might be happening in a wider geographical region beyond the Arabian peninsula. Virological evidence of MERS-CoV needs to be sought in patients with severe unexplained viral pneumonia in Africa in addition to the Middle East.",

Thus, overall, our data support and complement the viral genetic sequence data of the spike proteins of the dromedary viruses, which seem similar to the spike proteins of human MERS-CoV strains,11, 13, 16 and strongly suggest that dromedary MERS-CoV strains have the capacity to infect human beings.",

We therefore investigated whether human MERS-CoV and dromedary MERS-CoV differed in their ability to evade eliciting type I interferon and other innate immune responses. Because the multiplicity of infection cannot be accurately controlled in experiments with ex-vivo cultures of the human bronchus and lung, we used Calu-3, an epithelial cell line derived from human lung adenocarcinoma that has been used as a cell line to study viral infections of the human respiratory tract.20 Human MERS-CoV EMC, dromedary MERS-CoV AH13, and dromedary MERS-CoV NRCE-HKU270 replicated efficiently in these cells, although the dromedary MERS-CoV strains replicated significantly more efficiently in these cells (appendix). Despite this efficient virus replication, no virus elicited any TNF\u03b1, CXCL10, or interferon \u03b2 mRNA or protein responses after virus infection (figure 6). By contrast, influenza A H5N1 virus was a potent inducer of interferon \u03b2 and CXCL10. We noted some induction of interleukin 6 by dromedary MERS-CoV strains AH13 and NRCE-HKU270 and human MERS-CoV at late timepoints post infection (30 h; figure 6E and 6F). Importantly, the human and dromedary MERS-CoV behaved similarly by not eliciting interferon and CXCL10 responses, suggesting that these viruses do not differ in evasion of type I interferon responses.",

Serological and virological evidence of MERS-CoV in dromedaries has been reported from countries in east and north Africa outside of the Arabian peninsula,11, 12 but zoonotically acquired MERS has not yet been diagnosed in human beings in the African continent. Our finding that the genetically divergent dromedary MERS-CoV isolated in Egypt is phenotypically similar to human MERS-CoV EMC in explant cultures from human respiratory tissue underscores the possibility that zoonotic MERS might be occurring, unrecognised, in northeast Africa and beyond. At present, many countries only test for MERS-CoV in patients with a recent travel history to the Arabian peninsula, and locally acquired MERS could be missed. Alternatively, differences in cultural practices of camel husbandry, modes of animal contact, and consumption of animal products (eg, fresh camel's milk)22 might account for differences in occurrence of zoonotic disease in different geographical regions.",
