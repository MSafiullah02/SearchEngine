Here we use a nationwide dataset from China to provide a delineation of venous thromboembolism risk in patients with COVID-19.",

Bleeding risk was evaluated according to a published investigation, 7 with patients considered to be at high risk if they had two or more risk factors (aged 40 years or older, had hepatic failure (international normalised ratio >1\u00b75), had severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min per m\u00b2), were admitted to the intensive care unit or the coronary care unit, had a central venous catheter, were diagnosed with a rheumatic disease or active cancer, or were men), or had one of the three major risk factors associated with bleeding: active gastroduodenal ulcer, bleeding in the 3 months before admission, or platelet count less than 50 \u00d7 10\u2079/L. Patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism were older, and were more likely to have a high risk of bleeding, to have been admitted to the intensive care unit, to have had mechanical ventilation, and to have died as a result of COVID-19 or COVID-19 complications, such as venous thromboembolism, than patients at low risk of venous thromboembolism (table) . Laboratory findings on admission showed that more patients with high risk of venous thromboembolism had abnormal concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein than did patients with low risk after adjustment for age (appendix).",

Anticoagulant drugs are the cornerstone for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis; however, among the patients with COVID-19 at high risk of venous thromboembolism in this cohort, 44 (11%) of 407 also had a high risk of bleeding. For these patients, the dose and duration of anticoagulants should be adjusted, and mechanical compressions such as elastic compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression are warranted. Patients with COVID-19 can rapidly develop severe or critical disease, causing a series of complications such as renal failure, respiratory failure, or liver dysfunction, 2,3,10 which can affect both venous thromboembolism and bleeding status. Therefore, assessing venous thromboembolism and bleeding risks regularly is essential. Additionally, we found that patients with COVID-19 with a high risk of venous thromboembolism had poorer outcomes than patients with a low risk, suggesting that these patients might require increased attention in case of rapid deterioration.",
