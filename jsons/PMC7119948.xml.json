Neurologic failure is an important sign which may herald a treatable underlying disease. It is related to many factors: changes in inflammatory and immune signaling, hypoxia, circulatory shock, infection, endocrine changes, metabolic changes, and medications. Acquired neurologic disorders such as delirium and ICU-acquired weakness are independently associated with adverse short-term outcome. Cognitive impairment and neuromuscular weakness are prevalent in survivors of critical illnesses in particular ARDS and sepsis. Given this chronicity, neurologic expressions of critical illness may be viewed as distinct disorders with self-sustaining biological mechanisms rather than dependent processes which resolve with remission of the inciting illness. Management should be directed to underlying mechanisms as well as symptoms.",

Cardinal features are an acute alteration in mental status with inattention, disorganized thinking, and a fluctuating course. Delirium presents in two motoric subtypes, the more prevalent hypoactive delirium and the more easily recognized hyperactive form. Hyperactive delirium is readily identified, while the hypoactive form may be overlooked and untreated. The incidence of delirium is very high, up to 80 % of mechanically ventilated patients [1] and 30\u201340 % of less severe patients in the ICU [2]. In recent years, the significance of delirium has been recognized beyond the immediate safety of the patient, as delirium in the ICU has been shown to be predictive of mortality [1, 3, 4], prolonged ICU stay [5], increased cost [6], and long-term cognitive impairment [7, 8].",

The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) [9, 10] generates a binary result with patients categorized as either having or not having delirium; the tool may be implemented by the bedside nurse along with other routine clinical assessments. When compared with standard identifiers, the sensitivity and specificity of CAM-ICU is good (81 and 96 %), and the inter-rater reliability is high (kappa 0.79) [11]. CAM-ICU does not assess the type or severity of delirium; however, the burden of delirium can be quantified by estimating the time a patient is in delirium (Fig. 21.1) [12]. The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) [13] assigns a numerical score based on the presence or absence of eight characteristics. The ICSDC can be used to identify patients with incomplete presentations who may be at risk for delirium (subsyndromal delirium).\n\n",

Specific strategies include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions and should target all psychomotor types of delirium. Medications that could worsen delirium should be minimized. Benzodiazepines should be avoided whenever possible as they have been shown to increase the likelihood of delirium [17, 18]. Medications with anticholinergic side effects, and especially any anticholinergic drug known to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier such as atropine, should be avoided. Sedation protocols and daily interruptions of sedation should be implemented to decrease the exposure to deliriogenic medications and lessen the impact of delirium. Pharmacologic treatment centers on the use of antipsychotic medication both for confusional states and as a mild sedative. Neuroleptic medications such as haloperidol and more recently atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine and olanzapine have found frequent use in ICU-associated delirium [19\u201323]. These medications work particularly well against agitated symptoms of delirium, but may also be theoretically beneficial in hypoactive delirium analogously to their benefits against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A randomized controlled trial may help determine if antipsychotics are in fact efficacious for hypoactive delirium [20].",

The arousal system maintains alertness (wakefulness, vigilance) and serves as a gating mechanism for sensory inputs. It originates from the tegmental sections of the rostral pons and the midbrain. Two large branches ascend: one through the lateral hypothalamus and another through the thalamus. Neurotransmitters involved in these pathways are predominantly:\n\nNoradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus with diffuse cortical projectionsHistaminergic neurons prominent in the lateral hypothalamusCholinergic neurons in the dorsal pons with diffuse ascending and descending projections, but notably connections to the thalamus that are thought to regulate sleep and wakefulnessA more recently characterized orexin system located in the hypothalamus and responsible for modulating arousal pathways\n",

The sickness behavior linked to acute infection (discussion to come) induces daytime hypersomnolence and disruptions in sleep. Pain is common among various critical illness states and may prevent rest at night. Delirium is common in the critically ill, and agitated delirium may keep patients in an animated state, initiating a vicious cycle of sleep deprivation and agitated delirium. Critical illness and the ICU environment are associated with a high likelihood of sleep disruption and deprivation [33\u201338]. Patients are subject to procedures and assessments around the clock, and persistent lighting and noise may remove important cues driving circadian regulation. Noise is a major contributor to sleep impairment in the ICU due to physiologic alarms, overhead paging systems, staff conversations, and radio or television. Mechanical ventilation and patient-ventilator dyssynchrony in particular may disrupt sleep. Assist-control ventilation has been shown to be superior to pressure-support modes if nocturnal hyperventilation results in central apneas and arousals [39]. Further, proportional assist ventilation (PAV) may be superior to pressure support at night, an effect attributed to improved ventilator tolerance and synchrony [40]; additionally, PAV also avoids nocturnal hyperventilation. Medications, including stimulants and catecholamine agents, may decrease sleep. Benzodiazepine sedation may decrease REM sleep and the restorative effect of sleep.",

Quantification of the degree of impairment should be done for initial diagnosis and following the progress of disease. The recommended measure of global weakness is the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score (Table 21.7). The MRC score grades strength in a functional muscle group from 0 to 5. The sum score is generated when three muscle groups are tested from each extremity giving a maximum score of 60. ICU-AW is considered with MRC sum score < 48, severe weakness < 36. The test is repeatable and not costly to perform. Patients must be awake and cooperative for this assessment, and distal extremity strength is not tested.\n",

Currently, it appears reasonable to extrapolate these findings to comatose survivors of cardiac arrest in the inpatient setting. With greater implementation of hypothermia, existing prognostic models for post-cardiac arrest AIE [102] (anoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy) have been seriously challenged [103, 104].

            "text": "Clinical presentation may be subtle. CNS dysfunction may be one of the earliest signs of infection and may allow for timely diagnostic evaluation and therapy. Early presenting signs of SAE include inattention and fluctuating mental status consistent with acute delirium [114]. More severe SAE presents as coma. Motor manifestations may include velocity-dependent resistance to passive movement that diminishes as the limb is moved slowly (gegenhalten or paratonic rigidity) [114] but also asterixis, tremor, or myoclonus. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is very sensitive for sepsis-associated encephalopathy, even before clinically evident neurologic findings appear. Routine use of EEG in septic patients has been suggested as a means of categorizing patients with SAE [115]. The EEG change follows a progression with severity of encephalopathy and correlates with mortality. Early changes include slowing of the dominant rhythm: the thetas (19 % mortality), deltas (36 % mortality), the appearance of generalized triphasic waves (50 % mortality), and burst suppression (67 % mortality) [115]. While CT findings are generally unremarkable, MRI may reveal ischemic stroke or a pattern of leukoencephalopathy, which may represent breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier [116]; these findings on MRI correlate with poor outcome [116]. CSF analysis is negative for infection, but elevated protein may be present. Serum biomarker S100B may be elevated in some patients but does not correlate with severity of illness [117].",

Elevated cytokine levels inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) resulting in vasoconstriction and impaired microcirculatory flow. Cerebral autoregulation is impaired in septic shock patients; thus, hypotension during septic shock may result in significant decreases in CBF [120]. The endothelial dysfunction in sepsis also produces a procoagulant state, potentially contributing to microvascular infarcts [116]. Endotoxemia may cause impairment of blood\u2013brain barrier, leading to vasogenic edema and altering brain homeostasis. There may also be an alteration in the ratio of amino acids transported across the BBB, as aromatic amino acids are more readily transported than branch-chained amino acids. There is some indication that addition of branch-chained amino acids may be of benefit in the treatment of SAE [123].",
