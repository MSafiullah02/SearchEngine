These followups are conducted by a multidisciplinary team including surgeons, endocrinologists, psychologists, dieticians, and physiotherapists. The aim of these regular visits is fourfold: to manage their other comorbidities, nutritional monitoring, assessing for surgical complications, and to monitor their weight loss response and/or any weight regain. Bariatric patients, especially those post-RYGB, are at risk of both macroand micro-nutritional deficiencies such as iron, folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin D [14, 15] . If undiagnosed and untreated, such long-term nutritional deficiencies can lead to multiple medical problems like anemia and osteoporosis. The postoperative recovery for bariatric patients may also have an impact on their psychosocial well-being, eating behavior, and social functioning [16, 17] . Studies have shown that feelings of \"abandonment\" and \"isolation\" may dominate patients' recovery experience [16] . It is essential to ensure that our post-surgical patients remain psychologically and socially supported. In the long run, concerns of DM relapse [18] , inadequate weight loss, or weight regain also need to be addressed [19] . Studies have shown that elevated levels of distress secondary to COVID-19 can lead to emotional dysregulation, leading to increased impulsivity and binge eating symptoms before and after bariatric surgery [20, 21] .",

Firstly, telemedicine consults should be implemented where possible. Patients can still come to the hospital for their regular blood tests to monitor for any nutritional deficiencies or diabetic control. Subsequent consultations can be performed via telephone or an online platform. Pharmacies should arrange for home delivery services for essential medications. Secondly, online secure electronic platforms can be utilized to conduct group meetings/consults with dieticians and psychologists as required. Online social support groups can also be created. Thirdly, it may be beneficial to initiate a telephone-based intervention to reduce potential weight regains or diabetic relapses. Studies have shown that regular post-operative telephone calls addressing behavior change strategies for diet, physical activity, and nutrition can potentially decrease the incidence of weight regain [22] . Lastly, it should be emphasized to all patients that emergency surgical or medical support will be available at all times should they require any assistance for potential post-operative complications. Postsurgical patients with surgical complications that are lifethreatening or risk permanent organ damage should proceed with surgery as indicated [4] . These include but are not limited to the following: perforated marginal ulcer, bleeding, anastomotic or staple-line leak, intestinal obstruction including internal herniation, gastric band perforation, or prolapse. As surgical teams are being redeployed in alternative roles during this pandemic [23] , measures must be taken to ensure the integrity of emergency surgical teams to deal with potential bariatric emergencies.",

After a long hiatus, it is also likely that these patients will need to be screened and assessed again prior to surgery. A triaging system is required to decide on how patients should be prioritized to undergo bariatric surgery. We propose that patients who require bariatric surgery for the following reasons are of top priority: revision bariatric surgery for complications (dysphagia, severe reflux disease, malnutrition, anastomotic strictures, slipped band) and patients pending surgery who require pre-operative weight loss (e.g., transplant candidates). The next priority tier should include patients with severe nutritional deficiencies requiring revisional surgery and pre-bariatric surgery patients with poorly controlled comorbidities such as DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, and obstructive sleep apnea.",
