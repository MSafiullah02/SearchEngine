Depending on its distinctive long transcript, secondary structure, and subcellular location (7), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) can regulate gene expression at different levels (8). Numerous reports have shown that lncRNAs play important roles in the process of viral infection (9, 10). For example, following human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, late protein Vpu induces host cells to express lncRNA noncoding repressor of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (NRON) at a high level; afterward, NRON binds to the NFAT scaffold complex, resulting in transcriptional inhibition of HIV (11). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can upregulate the expression of lncRNA Lethe, and Lethe inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB, leading to the promotion of HCV replication (12).",

Regarding the different cell types in sputum, Guiot reported that there were macrophages (49%), squamous or epithelial cells (23%), lymphocytes (3%), eosinophils (1%) and so on, which could be divided into immune cells and epithelial cells (13). Considering that the proportion of lymphocytes and eosinophils in sputum is much lower than other cell types, we selected macrophages and epithelial cells to evaluate NRAV levels. For epithelial cells, A549 or BEAS-2B cells were infected with RSV for 72 h. Total RNA was collected at indicated time points since infection, and qRT-PCR was performed. NRAV was reduced in A549 (Fig. 1B) or BEAS-2B (Fig. 1C) cells during RSV infection, but PRINS, NEAT1, and NeST showed no difference (Fig. 1E to G). Similarly, for macrophages, the M\u03a6-THP-1cells (14) were infected and detected in the same manner. However, the expression of NRAV was decreased slightly in M\u03a6-THP-1cells, and the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 1D). As a result, NRAV was significantly downregulated in epithelial cells after RSV infection, and we mainly focused on A549 and BEAS-2B in vitro for the following study.",

Both NRAV knocked-down cells and the control group were infected by RSV (MOI = 3). Cell lysates were harvested at indicated time points to analyze RSV proliferation by virus plaque assay (Fig. 3B), immunoblotting (Fig. 3C), and qRT-PCR (Fig. 3D and E). The results showed that downregulation of NRAV induced lower RSV titer, less F protein expression, and lower RSV gene levels.",

In the overexpression group, pcDNA3.1-NRAV was transfected into A549 cells (n = 3), while pcDNA3.1 empty vector was transfected as the control (n = 3). In the knockdown group, NRAV siRNA (si-NRAV) (n = 1) and negative-control siRNA (si-control) (n = 1) were transfected into A549 cells. Data implied that there were 15 upregulated mRNAs in NRAV-overexpressed cells compared with the controls (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), and a total of 130 downregulated mRNAs were found in NRAV knocked-down cells (Table S2) (P < 0.05; fold change, \u22652). Interestingly, in the overlap of the two comparisons, we found only one molecule, Rab5c (GenBank accession number NM_201434.3), which was in the same trend as NRAV (Fig. 4A). To further confirm the mRNA sequence result, Rab5c levels were determined by qRT-PCR in clinical sputum specimens (RSV\u2013 75, RSV+ 69), which were the same samples used in Fig. 1A, and Rab5c expression in RSV-infected samples was lower than that in uninfected ones (Fig. 4B). Moreover, we examined Rab5c expression by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4C) or immunoblotting (Fig. 4D and E) in vitro, and RSV infection induced lower Rab5c expression than in the controls. The above results indicated that Rab5c was positively correlated with NRAV during RSV infection.",

Results indicated that RSV production could be improved when NRAV was overexpressed, and replication of RSV was inhibited when silencing NRAV. The experiment was carried out in A549 and BEAS-2B cells in functional experiments. The A549 cell line is derived from human adenocarcinoma type II alveolar cells, and BEAS-2B was developed from primary human bronchial epithelial cells transformed with adenovirus type 12 (Ad12)-SV40. Different characteristics were observed in these two cell lines during RSV infection. Hillyer (27) has reported that A549 cells are permissive to RSV infection and produce proinflammatory genes after RSV infection. Instead, BEAS-2B cells could restrict the infection and produce molecules characteristic of an antiviral reaction. Consequently, A549 cells were highly susceptible to RSV infection, whereas BEAS-2B cells limited infection to small individual foci or cells during RSV infection. Similar to those results, in our study, compared with BEAS-2B, when A549 cells were infected with RSV, the increase of RSV gene expression was much more obvious. Furthermore, overexpression of NRAV led to robust enhancement of RSV genes in A549, and the degree of increase was significantly higher than that in BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 5A and B).",

It is widely acknowledged that transfection of an NC siRNA or empty vector DNA might have a negligible impact on cells. In effect, however, Stepanenko and Heng have reported that a range of molecular manipulations from the NC siRNA or empty vector will probably influence the biological system, resulting in types of nonspecific effects on cells in the NC group. Furthermore, during the transient transfection, due to differences in nucleic acid type, total base amount, and molecular structure, the nonspecific impact from empty vector backbone RNA (pcDNA3.1, 5,428 bp) and siRNA (double-strand short interfering RNA, 21 bp) could differ from each other (28), which might induce the expression features of RSV genes that were quite different in the EV and siNC groups.",

Based on the results that NRAV was mainly located in the cytoplasm subcelluarly and showed the same trend with Rab5c, we tentatively put forward the idea that NRAV and Rab5c might share the same miRNA in cytoplasm, which is a major miRNA pool. In the light of bioinformatics analysis and a previous report, miR-509-3p has been reported to be able to bind Rab5c (22). Meanwhile, NRAV was predicted to bind to miR-509-3p\u2019s seed region (Fig. 4L). Subsequently, we combined RNA pulldown (Fig. 4I) and dual luciferase reporter assays (Fig. 4M and N) to identify the NRAV/miR-509-3p association.

The results showed that whether the RNA was extracted 24, 36, or 48 h postinfection, silencing NRAV reduced RSV F expression, and miR-509-3p inhibitor could rescue this decrease. With the extension of time, however, the expression of the F gene changed dynamically in the rescue group. When the cells were infected for 24 or 36 h, miR-509-3p inhibitor could significantly rescue the expression of F in mRNA level (data not shown). Nevertheless, at 48 h postinfection, the recovery of F expression was not as high as that at 24 or 36 h. Interestingly, in the rescue group, the mRNA level of the F gene at 24 h postinfection was somewhat consistent with F protein at 48 h after infection. As a result, when both RNA and protein were extracted at 48 h postinfection, the mRNA abundance of the F gene might not have a linear relationship with the expression of the F protein.",

(N) RSV replication was examined by plaque assay in cells transfected with si-NRAV or Rab5cS35N or cotransfected with Rab5cQ80L. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SD for three independent experiments. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.",
