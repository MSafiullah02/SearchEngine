Two notable SSE were observed early in the epidemic and have been widely reported: at the Amoy Gardens housing estate and at the Prince of Wales hospital. Epidemiological studies [3], [4] have found that in Hong Kong: the fatality rate was approximately 17% (compared to 11% globally); the mean incubation period was 6.4 days (range 2\u201310) [5]; the duration between onset of symptoms and hospitalization was 3\u20135 days; and the mean number of individuals infected by each case during the initial phase of the epidemic was 2.7 [2]. Like any epidemic, an initial exponential outbreak is evident in the SARS infection data for Hong Kong [5], but this initial explosion was soon tempered. In this paper, we present an alternative explanation for the occurrence of SSE. We show that SSE may occur, as a result of social structure, even if the etiological agent is equally infectious in all patients.",

These four categories are similar to, but distinct from the SEIR type model of infection widely used to model diseases with a significant incubation period [11]. As is usual, the class S represents individuals that are susceptible to the infectious agent, but are not yet infected. Category R represents individuals that are permanently incapable of either transmitting or acquiring the disease: typically, this represents those that have recovered from the infection (and are assumed to be immune), those that have died, and those that are either isolated or quarantined. The I class represents individuals that are infected and infectious, whereas P represents those that are infected but not yet infectious (similar to E in the standard formulation).",

The population of N nodes are arranged in a regular grid, of side length L (L2=N) and each node is connected directly to n1 immediate neighbors.1\nAn infected individual will infect each of its n1 neighbors (provided they are still susceptible) with probability p1. Furthermore, each node has n2 long distance links (see Fig. 2). These are links to nodes that are geographically remote from one another, infection occurs along these pathways with probability p2. For each node i the number n2(i) is fixed and so are the links to its n2(i) remote neighbors. The number n2(i) is chosen to follow a discrete exponentially decaying distribution fX(x)=(1/C)e-x/\u03bc with parameter \u03bc proportional to the expected (average) number of links to remote nodes, and parameter C=1/(1-e-1/\u03bc) ensures that fC is a probability distribution function. It is the inclusion of long distance links with a random number of links that gives rise to the network's SW structure. Moreover, the same long distance links can also cause the network to exhibit scale free (SF) properties. By SF we mean that logarithm of the probability of a node having n links is inversely proportional to logn (very large number of links occur relatively frequently). Whether the induced network of actual infections follows a SF distribution remains to be tested [7] and is not the focus of this paper.",

From the available data we know that the average incubation period between infection and becoming symptomatic is 6.4 days [5]. With transition probability r0 the number of days in the prone state is the result of a series of independent Bernoulli trials with a mean 1/r0 and therefore follows a geometric distribution fX(x)=(1-p)x-1p (see Fig. 3\n). Similarly, the time before hospitalization (and presumably quarantining and therefore removal) is 3\u20135 days. Suppose that the average is 4. In our model, the number of days prior to hospitalization also follows a geometric distribution with mean 1/r1.

The problem of mutual acquaintances complicates things slightly, but this will not have an significant effect on the result. Moreover, if we set n1=4 (the horizontal and vertical neighbors only) then the probability of two nodes having mutual acquaintances is only n2=N. Hence, in our simulations, we take n1=4 and E(n2)=\u03bc=7. Note that the choice of n1 and n2 is not critical, what is more important is the infection probability p1n1+p2n2.4\nIn fact, the variation in control (such as quarantining of suspected infected individuals) can be equally modelled as a reduction in n1 and n2.

From Fig. 4 we see that, consistent with our expectations, for large p2 the scale of the outbreak increases. Moreover outbreaks are most likely when there is clustering (i.e., p2>0). However, we also note that the total number of infections, even in the worst case is significantly lower than for the true data. In comparison the number suspected cases in Hong Kong 50 days after the first reported case was 1589. From the revised data for Hong Kong, the number of identified SARS cases 50 after the index patient was hospitalized was 1161. Hence, even with external control measures the true data is significantly larger than these model simulations.",

We also decrease p2 to reflect the changing health practices of the community. For the sake of simplicity we introduce only a single step change in p2 at the peak of the epidemic.

However, by imposing a SW-SF structure on the system we simulated the effect of propagation by acquaintance: one can only become infected after contact with an infected individual [13], [14]. Furthermore, the explicit modelling of associations allows more effective simulation of control measures such as quarantining (or school closure). Finally, localized outbreaks (SSE) can be more realistically modelled with the inhomogeneous SW-SF model structure. The implication of this is that the SSE do not necessarily require highly contagious individuals, only a highly connected individual, and, highly connected individuals occur naturally in any community. In other words, high rates of infection for certain individuals are not necessarily related to the action of the disease, only to their degree of social connectedness. Therefore we conclude that a highly variable infection rate is not necessarily a significant factor in the transmission of SARS.",
