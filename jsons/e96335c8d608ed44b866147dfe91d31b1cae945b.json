Recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 fails to induce significant amounts of interferon (IFN) in tumour tissue explant cultures [1] and in in vitro cell and animal models [2] , the latter specifying that IFN expression may however be obtained at high multiplicity of infection. Since IFNs are known to play a key role in the response to viral infections, the aforementioned low ability of SARS-CoV-2 to induce all IFN types is significant from a pathogenetic point of view and such failure may be one of the keys to explaining the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Indeed, it has been proposed that the lack of induction of significant amounts of all types of IFN may influence the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 load in nasopharyngeal secretions [1] , possibly explaining the high transmissibility of the infection, and that a reduced innate antiviral defence is associated with elevated inflammatory cytokine production [2] . The above data has led to the conclusion that the use of exogenous IFN to stimulate antiviral immunity might be successful for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection [3] . All the above results await interpretation from the perspective of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infection pathophysiology, considering the very recent finding on IFN-induced expression of ACE2 receptor [4] .",
