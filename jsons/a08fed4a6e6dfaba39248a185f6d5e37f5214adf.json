This finding has previously been reported. (15, 16) All our patients were treated with different regimens of potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV2. The medication was started within 24 hours of admission. We could not compare the different schemes because our report is only a case series compared to well-designed trials. (17, 18) Tocilizumab was given to 11 (44%) and 6 (75%) of our severe and critical pneumonia patients, respectively. The rationale for such a decision was based on observational data implicating the overwhelming systemic inflammatory cascade as a culprit in the physiopathology of this new and poorly understood disease and the plausible role for immunomodulation in these populations. (19, 20) All the patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia required mechanical ventilation with a mean duration of 12 days, similar to critically ill patients in Seattle, where the duration of mechanical ventilation was 10 days. (21) Noteworthy is that our extubation rate was higher (91.6%) than in other series. In addition, we did not have any fatalities.",

Severe COVID-19 pneumonia can be complicated with prothrombotic coagulopathy, causing both major thromboembolic events and microthrombi in end-organ capillary beds. Therefore, it is currently recommended that all patients (unless contraindicated) should receive thromboprophylaxis, and those with elevated coagulation markers (specifically D-dimer) should receive full dose anticoagulation, as it appears to be associated with lower mortality. Our patients were managed following these recommendations.(23,24) Our study has several limitations: it is a small descriptive case series report, and there may be confounders in the analysis of the results, in concordance with most described data in the current literature. Another disadvantage is the lack of generalisability and the fact that 9 patients remained in the hospital at the time of data censoring on April 19Available from: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3575581 23.
