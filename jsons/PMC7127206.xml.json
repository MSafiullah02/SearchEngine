Furthermore anti-inflammatory [17], antioxidant and free radical scavenging [18], [19] effects were reported. Additionally, anti-viral effects against HIV [20], [21] and the SARS coronavirus [22] could be observed.

NIR spectroscopic methods have been developed in combination with multivariate data analysis for fruit [32], [33], coffee [34], plant [35], [36] and pharmaceutical [37] applications. Both methods demonstrated their suitability for many applications, but just a few comparative studies can be found in the literature. ATR-IR has disadvantages for inhomogeneous samples because of the low penetration depth and the small scanning area [36]. To overcome this problem, the samples were milled and homogenized to obtain comparable results.",
