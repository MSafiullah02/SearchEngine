            "text": "After TRIPS was signed, member countries of the WTO, especially the developing countries, were faced with increasing public health crises and have been persistently seeking a new balance between patent protection and the public health interest of providing essential medicine to their citizens. It is clear that the old WTO regulation and TRIPS agreement actually prevent developing countries from getting essential medicines and also hinder their capability to handle the frequent attacks of emerging infectious diseases. Further development and policy advancement of the WTO regulations are needed to establish a new balance between the protection of intellectual property of medicines and the interests of public health.",

As major exporters of these products, developed countries advocate the protection of intellectual property while developing countries worry that intellectual property rights only support the monopoly led by international companies and raise the price of the drugs and total medical costs, ultimately having a negative impact on public health emergency response capability . In 1995, the TRIPS agreement was implemented in Uruguay Round to join the protection of intellectual property rights and the cross-retaliation system of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Developing countries agreed to protect intellectual property in exchange for market access and trade preferences from developed countries. In particular, the U.S. used its economic hegemony, along with the trade preference \"Carrot\" and the big-stick policy of \"Super 301 sanctions of penalty article\" to force other countries to accept the TRIPS agreement [ 4 ] , causing con fl ict over the protection of intellectual property and the right to obtain essential medicines.",

            "text": "After over 5 years of debate and negotiations with pressure from the governments of mainly in developing countries and nongovernmental organizations, a consensus was reached. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (simply referred to as the \"Doha Declaration\") was adopted in November of [ 5 ] . It states that the \"TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health. Accordingly, while reiterating our commitment to the TRIPS Agreement, we af fi rm that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members' rights to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all\" [ 6 ] . Therefore, the Doha Declaration reaf fi rms the right of WTO member states to grant compulsory licenses in a state of national emergency. Compulsory licensing refers to a government's consent to someone other than the patent owner to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner. Speci fi cally in the medical fi eld, the term denotes the government allowing a third party to produce patented drugs. However, TRIPS mandates that the drugs produced under a compulsory license must be used only in the domestic market, which creates a major obstacle for the countries with no manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector to import unregistered generic drugs [ 6 ] .",

This additional stipulation to the law removed obstacles hindering developing countries' ability to make full use of compulsory licenses. The second revision waived the remuneration to patent holders from importing countries because the exporting country already pays it. This General Council decision resolved the previous issues of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration.

Developing countries should make full use of the privileges introduced by this document by granting compulsory licenses in public health related areas or use it as a tool to acquire a voluntary license in the local manufacture of drugs or in negotiation for affordable drug price. These areas should target drugs for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and tumors, including HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, as well as malignant tumors, to break the high price barrier of imported patent drugs and make them accessible to the respective country's population.

It is estimated that 75,000 of those receiving ARV treatment in Brazil will be using efavirenz by the end of 2007. Efavirenz (in tablets of 600 mg) was sold in Brazil at $580 per patient per year, which was 136% higher than the price offered by Thailand [ 9 ] . The Brazilian government attempted negotiations for a lower price with Merck beginning in November 2006. They threatened Merck with a compulsory license unless Brazil could sell efavirenz at a rate equal to or less than the rate offered to Thailand. After 6 months of unsuccessful negotiations, the Brazilian government issued their fi rst compulsory license on May 4, 2007 . Brazil reduced the price per day from $1.56 to $0.45 by buying Indian generic products. The government expected to save $30 million in 2007 and a total of $237 million between 2007 and 2012. \"From an ethical point of view the price difference is grotesque,\" said Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. \"And from a political point of view, it represents a lack of respect, as though a sick Brazilian is inferior,\" he added. \"Our decision today involves this one drug, but we can take the same steps with any other that we consider necessary.\"",

Because kaletra's cost of production was less than $400, the Thai MOH decided to issue a compulsory license. Abbott responded by arguing that the Thai government was ignoring the patent law and threatened to withdraw registration of all new drugs in Thailand. However, the WHO along with many other individual countries and NGOs af fi rmed that the movement of issuing compulsory licenses was consistent with International Law.

Indian premier Rajiv Gandhi once said, \"Medical inventions are not patented, and we cannot make pro fi ts between life and death.\" The patent law issued in 1970 declared that food, medicine, agricultural chemicals cannot be patented; only the method of making these products can be patented. Therefore, one can make the same exact product or drug by a different methodology according to the Indian Patent Law. This regulation was vital to the rise of the Indian domestic pharmaceutical industry. For many years, the Indian government has withstood pressure from western countries and maintained ef fi cient laws for generic production on the grounds of promoting health and equity. After its entrance into the WTO in 1995, India was pressured by western countries to enter the TRIPS agreement but was granted a period of 10 years to adapt their patent laws to the international standards. India issued the 2004 Patent (amendment) Bill on December 26, 2004 . This law mandates that India must begin accepting medicine, agricultural chemicals, and food patent applications from January 1, 2005. However, the Indian government stated that they would only recognize applications submitted from January 1, 1995 onwards and also declared that certain drugs, methods, or applications cannot be patented. At the same time, the Indian Patent Of fi ce maintains a unique fl exibility in its approval process for generic drugs [ 44 ] . For example, if the US FDA has approved a drug, a generic version can be approved for use without fi rst going through a clinical trial in India.",

This signi fi cant cost savings contributed to PEPFAR's ability to dramatically improve access to antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions. In 2008, there were eight PEPFAR programs that procured at least 90% of ARV packs in generic form. Additionally, deliveries in Ethiopia, Haiti, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe were more than 99% generic. The of fi cer in PEPFAR strongly supported the use of generic drugs because saving money ultimately means saving more lives [ 45 ] . One of the biggest hurdles in the rapid scale-up of ARV therapy in developing countries is the high cost of the ARV drugs. However, developed countries in the west and large international pharmaceutical companies are strongly against the compulsory licenses. They often justify their standpoint that they believe it is against patent law to produce generic drugs and that such ability will have a negative impact on the research and development of new drugs. The use of patented drugs is acceptable in developing countries. However, given the current epidemics and public health crises in developing countries, patented drugs are simply inadequate. Generic medications provide an affordable means to provide treatment to more people suffering from HIV/AIDS. In order to solve the demand of patent drugs in developing countries, and to save more lives around the world, the best long-term solution can be provided by compulsory licensing.",

The signi fi cant polarization of the rich and the poor can be translated to accessibility and inaccessibility of medical drugs, which equates with developed countries and developing countries. Differing from other commodities, drugs are essential for saving lives. The international community has reached a consensus about the con fl ict between the monopolies protected by patents and public health and has chosen to protect public health and expand the accessibility of drugs. This decision is apparent in the TRIPS agreement adopted by WTO General Council in 2005. Developing countries should use the rights endowed by Protocol Amending the TRIPS agreement and issue compulsory licenses for drugs against major diseases to safeguard the health of their people and public health interests of their nations.",

However, when there is a public health threat, developed countries will issue compulsory licenses without hesitation to solve the crisis. A good example is the US government forcing Bayer to reduce the price of Cipro using the compulsory licensing as a last resort after the September 11 attack in 2001. A WHO of fi cial pointed out that the global economy increases at an annual rate of 1%, much lower than the increase of average drug prices. According to the 2007 OECD report, drugs that took up 6-7% of the health budget of developed countries 10 years ago doubled or tripled their percentage in the health budget today [ 46 ] . At the present trend, developed countries may have dif fi culties affording the high drug prices in the next 10-20 years and may choose compulsory licensing as a tool to solve their health care.",

While the treatment was widely available in developed countries, AIDS patients in developing countries, which make up more than 90% of the AIDS patients worldwide, were still dying in large numbers. Some developing countries such as Thailand, Brazil, Malaysia, and South Africa took a bold move to provide generic drugs to their AIDS patients through the compulsory licensing. Such acts not only saved many lives, but also eased the burden of high drug costs and prevented the collapse of their national economies.

Additionally, the big pharmaceutical companies in the developed countries developed all of the ARV drugs and most of the anti-TB and malaria drugs. Some of the drugs were developed by developing countries, such as artemisinin, which was invented by the Chinese scientists. Without the close collaborations in the last decade between the south and the north and the private and public, the lives of several millions of HIV/AIDS patients, TB patients, and malaria patients would not have been saved. Therefore, developed countries and big pharmaceutical companies must ally with the developing countries in the war against AIDS, TB, malaria, and other infectious diseases. Due to the lack of such collaboration, the initial sparks of HIV infections in central Africa become a global AIDS pandemic killing 30 million lives in both the developing and developed world. Such tragedy can only be prevented through further strengthening collaboration between the private and public sectors in both developed and developing countries.",
