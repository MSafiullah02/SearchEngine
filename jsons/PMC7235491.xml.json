Many articles are being hastily and noncritically published, contain repetitive or inaccurate information, illogical and non\u2013evidence\u2010based recommendations, and are highly biased. The following are some of the examples:\nan article published in a top surgical journal that advised avoiding sharp injuries in the operating theatre, and postulated that coronavirus may spread through electrocautery vapour\n2\n (based on a laboratory experiment on HIV particles in vapour formed by electrocautery that was refuted 30 years ago);over 250 reports on chest computed tomography (CT) findings in COVID\u201019 patients, including several reviews and development of various predictive scores. All articles basically concluded the same that chest CT in COVID\u201019 patients shows findings common in viral pneumonias and that it is not possible to discriminate COVID\u201019 pneumonia from other viral pneumonias.\n3\n It is also worth noting that the same pulmonary CT scan findings were reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003\n4\n;study on certain antiviral agent efficacy in COVID\u201019 patients, designed, conducted and written by the sponsor, without control group and without clearly stating how the patients were selected among those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria\n5\n; anddevelopment of various prediction models for COVID\u201019 that mostly confirm and reinvent already well\u2010known predictors of poor outcome in patients with respiratory failure. A large review concluded that all of those articles are of low quality, poorly reported and highly biased.\n6\n\n\n",
