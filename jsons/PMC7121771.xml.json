CTLs form a large family containing soluble and membrane-bound proteins and the family members share a common domain structure named the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which consists of 18 highly conserved amino acid residues including two folds of disulfide bonds formed by four cysteine residues [20]. However, not all of the structurally related CRDs have been shown to bind Ca2+ or carbohydrates, and the term C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) has been designated for the domain without Ca2+-dependent sugar-binding capacity, whose amino acid sequence shows incomplete conservation of the common residues in the CRD [22]. It should be noted that the term CTLD is also used for the broad definition containing all CTLs irrespective of carbohydrate recognition [116].",

            "text": "Phagocytes, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), also express various kinds of CTL receptors on their cell surface for antigen capture. The mannose receptor (MR) family (group VI) contains type I transmembrane proteins with multiple CTLDs, such as the MR (CD206) and DEC-205 (CD205) [27]. They commonly consist of an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain and a fibronectin type II domain as well as eight or ten CTLDs. In contrast, the asialoglycoprotein receptor family (group II) contains type II transmembrane proteins with a single CTLD, such as DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN, CD209), dectin-1, dectin-2, DC immunoreceptor (DCIR), and macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) [4, 5, 9, 33, 69]. Notably, expression of some receptors is specific and they can be markers for distinct DC subsets; langerin (CD207) on Langerhans cells (LCs) and blood DC antigen (BDCA)-2 (CD303) on plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) [25, 99]. Most of the genes for these group II receptors are also clustered in or next to the NKC (Fig. 17.2) [55]. In contrast to KLRs, most receptors of both groups contain fully conserved CRDs binding carbohydrates, and are considered to work as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognizing various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Especially, dectin-1 is critical for recognition of fungal \u03b2-glucan and has a collaborative effect with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 on yeast-induced activation signals, whereas DC-SIGN is involved in the recognition of a variety of microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, and suppresses the immune activation signals induced by these pathogens [13, 32, 100]. For these pathogen-recognizing CTL receptors, \u201cCLRs\u201d have been designated analogous to other PRRs, such as TLRs, NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I\u2013like receptors (RLRs) [37]. Notably, most of the CLRs are linked to the signaling cascade through the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating or inhibitory motif (ITAM or ITIM, respectively), which was first identified in paired KLRs [38, 102]. Hemi-ITAM in dectin-1 and ITAM of Fc receptor \u03b3 chain (FcR\u03b3) associated with dectin-2, BDCA-2, and mincle recruit spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) leading to activating signals, whereas ITIM in DCIR recruits Src homology two domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases (SHPs) exhibiting inhibitory effects (Fig. 17.3) [57, 74]. In addition, some of them are also able to bind endogenous self-molecules and are involved in some pathophysiological aspects. For example, DC-SIGN have a role in cellular trafficking, DC-SIGN and dectin-1 can mediate an interaction between DC and T cells, and dectin-2 is involved in ultraviolet (UV)-induced tolerance [2, 5, 33, 35]. Furthermore, dectin-1 and DCIR are involved in the development of autoimmunity in mice, and SNPs in CLEC4A and CLEC4E encoding DCIR and mincle, respectively, are reportedly associated with autoimmune arthritis [31, 47, 65, 108, 115].\n\n",

Once they capture and internalize antigens, they modulate expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors to migrate through dermal lymphatics into the draining lymph node and there, after maturation, they present processed antigens to the specific T cells. LCs have been defined electron-microscopically by the presence of Birbeck granules (BGs) with a \u201ctennis-racket\u201d-like appearance, and immunohistochemically with BG-specific Lag antibody [12, 56].",

Langerin has no signaling motif other than the proline-rich domain for internalization in its intracellular domain.

Indeed, it was first cloned from placenta as a HIV-1 gp120-binding protein independent of CD4 [17]. DC-SIGN stands as a tetramer and contains dileucine (LL) and YxxL internalization motif in its intracellular domain [90]. Its binding to gp120 was inhibited by mannan, D-mannose, and L-fucose and, after binding, gp120 was immediately internalized [17]. DC-SIGN does not allow HIV-1 entry into DCs, but promotes its efficient infection in trans of cells expressing CD4 and chemokine receptors [34]. DC-SIGN also functions for capturing dengue virus, a mosquito-mediated flavivirus that causes hemorrhagic fever, and is indispensable for its infection to DCs [73, 95]. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic tail of DC-SIGN is not essential for, but enhances dengue virus infection to DCs. DC-SIGN is also involved in infection of other viruses such as Ebola, cytomegaloviruses, human C-type hepatitis virus (HCV), measles, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori and Klebsiela Pneumonae, fungi such as Candida albicans, and parasites such as Leishmania pifanoi and Schistosoma mansoni [74, 101].",

In immature DCs, internalized mycobacteria or ManLAM are transported into lysosome, where they are colocalized with LAMP1. Notably, targeting DC-SIGN with soluble ManLAM inhibits mycobacteria- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced DC maturation and induces IL-10 production, suggesting that DC-SIGN signaling interferes with the TLR signaling to cause an anti-inflammatory effect. Such an effect has been shown to be mediated by a serine/threonine kinase Raf1 signaling, which does not require the cytoplasmic YxxL motif of DC-SIGN but involves formation of a distinct protein complex (LSP1, KSR, CNK, LARG, and RhoA) with DC-SIGN [42]. Raf1 signaling does not induce DC activation but modulates TLR-mediated nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB activation, resulting in increased and prolonged transcription of IL-10 and some other cytokines. By analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage cells, alveolar macrophages from tuberculosis patients specifically expressed DC-SIGN, and its expression was induced by M. tuberculosis independently of TLR4, IL-4, and IL-13 [97]. Indeed, accumulation of M. tuberculosis in DC-SIGN-expressing alveolar macrophages was immunohistochemically shown.",

Dectin-1 and TLR2 are colocalized on the surface of zymosan-treated macrophages and the zymosan-induced activation signals require dectin-1 as well as TLR2. Notably, the YxxL hemi-ITAM (hemITAM) in the cytoplasmic tail of dectin-1 is shown to be essential for this activation. Upon zymosan-binding, this hemITAM directly recruits and activates spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), probably dependent on the receptor dimerization, which induces NF-\u03baB activation through interaction with caspase recruitment domain (CARD) nine coupled with the Bcl10\u2013Malt1 complex [46, 82]. Recently, protein kinase (PK) C-\u03b4 was identified to link Syk activation and CARD9 signaling [93]. This Syk activation also induces IL-1\u03b2 secretion, through pro-IL\u20131\u03b2 transcription and processing, mediated by the CARD9-Bcl10\u2013Malt1 and the Malt1-ASC\u2013caspase 8 complex, respectively [45]. The latter complex is called noncanonical caspase 8-dependent inflammasome. Additionally, zymosan-induced dectin-1\u2013dependent signals reportedly include phospholipase (PL) C\u03b32-dependent Ca2+ influx leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as well as NF-\u03baB [109].",

Furthermore, zymosan-mediated dectin-1 signaling induced IL-23 production and exacerbated autoimmunity through Th1/Th17 responses in TLR2-deficient mice, whereas zymosan-mediated TLR2 signaling activated Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells through induction of IL-10 and Raldh2, an essential enzyme in retinoic acid metabolism [66]. Thus, antifungal dectin-1 signaling is considered rather aggressive and regulated by the simultaneous TLR2 signaling to prevent autoimmunity. Notably, dectn-1\u2013deficient mice were shown to be impaired in zymosan recognition and increased in susceptibility to Candida albicans infection, whereas, in another report, they were rather more susceptible to Pneumocystis carini infection [83, 94].",

The mutation was homozygous in three sisters with vulvovaginal candidiasis and/or onychomycosis and heterozygous in their parents with onychomycosis. The mutated dectin-1, which lacks C-terminal 10 amino acids, showed defective \u03b2-glucan binding and induction of cytokine productions after stimulation with \u03b2-glucan or Candida albicans. However, fungal phagocytosis and killing were shown to be unaffected and, therefore, invasive fungal infection was not observed in the patients. The allele frequency of the Y238X variant is reportedly 0.069 in the healthy Dutch population and identified carriers are all heterozygous, and the variant has never been found in the Chinese population [29]. In addition, the same variant was reported to be a risk factor of increased susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with the highest risk in cases where the variant is present in both donors and recipients [16].",

DCIR is unique among known DC/macrophage CLRs because of the presence of I/VxxYxxV/L immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic portion. As the ITIM-related signaling capacity of DCIR, SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1 and SHP-2 can be recruited to human DCIR upon stimulation [48, 78]. Furthermore, using murine B cells expressing a chimeric receptor containing a cytoplasmic portion of DCIR and ectodomain of Fc\u03b3RIIB (DCIR-FcR), coligation of DCIR-FcR and B cell receptor (BCR) showed DCIR-ITIM-dependent inhibitory effects on BCR-mediated calcium influx and tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins [52]. On the other hand, murine DCAR was identified as a molecule whose CRD shows 91% amino acid identity with that of DCIR [53]. DCAR interacts with FcR\u03b3 to stand efficiently on the cell surface and ligation of the chimeric DCAR-FcR induced activation signals into its expressing cells dependent on the ITAM in FcR\u03b3. Thus, DCIR and DCAR are equipped as structurally and functionally paired immunoreceptors in mice, although the biological significance of their pairing has been undefined [55].",

Notably, DCIR expression was detected not only in myeloid DCs, but also in monocytes, macrophages, B cells, neutrophils, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) [55, 71]. By reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, the only reliable method to distinguish expression of DCIR and DCAR, DCAR was rather limitedly observed, strongly in spleen and lung and weakly in skin and lymph nodes, whereas DCIR was detected ubiquitously. Both increased during the bone-marrow\u2013derived DC development, but increase of the DCAR expression preceded that of DCIR [53].

HIV-1 captured by surface DCIR is stored as intact virion and replicates de novo intracellularly in infected DCs and, subsequently, is transmitted to CD4+ T cells through induced DCIR expression on them, where HIV-1 replication is enhanced [61, 62]. These processes have been shown to be mediated by the ITIM signaling. Furthermore, DCIR can act as an attachment factor for HCV on pDCs [30]. Notably, the binding of HCV to DCIR on pDCs induced specific inhibition of TLR9-induced IFN\u03b1 production, in contrast to the case of DCIR activation on DCs by anti-DCIR monoclonal antibody (mAb), which induced specific inhibition of TLR8-induced IL-12 and TNF\u03b1 production [30, 71, 72].",

However, unlike other FcR\u03b3-coupled CLRs, BDCA-2 signaling does not lead to NF-\u03baB activation through the Syk\u2013PKC\u03b4\u2013CARD9 pathway, but passes through the Syk\u2013BLNK\u2013 PLC\u03b32 pathway [81]. Indeed, contrary to its predicted immunoactivating property, ligation of BDCA-2 suppressed the production of type I IFN and the secretion of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in pDCs induced by various TLR agonists [25, 76]. Furthermore, inhibition of type I IFN production enhances IL-12 production in pDCs to polarize immune responses towards Th1 [26]. BDCA-2-mediated suppression of type I IFN production by CpG oligonucleotides or by influenza virus suggests that viruses target BDCA-2 for immune escape. On the other hand, the same phenomenon induced by antidouble-stranded DNA mAb plus plasmid DNA or by sera from patients of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) suggests that targeting BDCA-2 is beneficial for treatment of SLE.",
