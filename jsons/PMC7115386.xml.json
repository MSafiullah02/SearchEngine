Although live and inactivated vaccines have contributed immensely to the management of IB, control is suboptimal due to a number of factors, including inefficient application of vaccine and extensive antigenic variation [3]; serotypes induce poor cross-protection [4], [5], [6]. The poultry industry is moving towards in ovo vaccination where possible. This has been achieved for Marek's disease. To date all IB vaccines have severely reduced hatching. We have two strategic goals. One, to modify the genome of our molecularly cloned cDNA of the Beaudette strain of IBV (non-pathogenic) to achieve optimum stimulation of protection whilst retaining its non-pathogenic phenotype in both chicks and 10-day-old embryos. Two, to swap the gene of the spike protein (S), which induces protective immunity, to make a vaccine appropriate for a prevailing serotype.",

The S protein comprises two subunits: S1 (\u223c520 amino acids), derived from the amino-terminal half of the S polyprotein, and the membrane anchoring S2 subunit (\u223c625 amino acids), derived from the carboxy-terminal half. The S1 spike protein subunit is necessary and sufficient to induce protective immunity [10]. Serotypes commonly differ from one another by 20\u201325% of S1 amino acids [1], [2], although differences in as few as 5% of the amino acids in S1 can decrease cross-protection [11]. A new generation of IB vaccines will still require that S protein genes of different serotypes are available. S gene swapping could result in changes in pathogenicity, as has been demonstrated for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Enjuanes and colleagues [12], [13]). Therefore we have investigated this, simultaneously examining the protection-inducing capacity of spike-swapped rIBVs [11].",

Inactivation of the production of these proteins had little or no effect on the titres of virus produced in cell cultures [17], [18], [19] showing that they, too, were accessory proteins. In some, though not all, cases, failure to produce these proteins resulted in attenuation of pathogenicity.

The products of the polyproteins are associated with RNA replication and transcription [20], [21]. However, the IBV gene 1 does not encode a product equivalent to nsp1, expressed from gene 1 of the other coronaviruses, and therefore IBV gene 1 encodes 15 products, named nsp2\u2013nsp16 to be consistent with the gene 1 products encoded by the other coronaviruses. In order to test the hypothesis that one or more of the four structural protein genes and/or accessory protein genes 3 and 5 of the pathogenic M41 strain were determinants of the pathogenicity, we made a rIBV that had gene 1 from Beaudette and all other genes from M41. The recombinant was viable but was not pathogenic and caused little ciliostasis in tracheal organ cultures (Maria Armesto, D. Cavanagh and P. Britton, in preparation). Looked at one way, Beaudette had not been made pathogenic by substitution of its non-gene 1 genes with those from pathogenic M41. An alternative way of looking at it is to say that the pathogenicity of the M41 strain had been attenuated by replacement of its gene 1 by that of Beaudette. Either way, it indicates that one or more of the gene 1-encoded proteins are determinants of pathogenicity. Our result does not negate the possibility that genes 3 and 5 have \u2018self-defence\u2019 roles but it does indicate that their affect can be overcome by proteins encoded by gene 1. Hence gene 1 is another target for rational attenuation for vaccine development.",

Firstly, this demonstrated that spike-swapped rIBVs were effective at inducing protective immunity.

Therefore the rIBVs based on Beaudette but expressing the UK/4/91 S protein had to be recovered using 10-day-old embryonated eggs. We have also replaced the Beaudette S protein gene with the S protein gene of the Begian BE/B1648/87 strain. In this case, recombination between the S genes of B1648 (in a plasmid) and Beaudette (within the full-length IBV genome cDNA within the vaccinia virus genome) was allowed to happen randomly, resulting in recovery of several rIBVs with different cross-over points within the S gene, i.e. producing rIBVs with chimaeric S genes (S. Izadkhasti, D. Cavanagh and P. Britton, in preparation). This demonstrated that recombination within the S gene can give rise to viable recombinant IBVs, at high frequency (\u223c50% in our experiments), providing hard evidence to support the circumstantial evidence (sequence comparison of field strains) that recombination is a feature of the evolution of IBV.",

Neither of the two rIBVs strains reduced hatchability or caused nasal discharge, and caused minimal damage to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea (Table 1\n). In contrast, a commercial vaccine (refereed to as CV1) drastically reduced the hatch and caused substantial clinical signs (Table 1). The rIBVs induced a serological response and the spike-swapped rIBV gave a high level of protection of the embryos against virulent M41 challenge (Table 1).

Deletion of all the non-gene 1 accessory proteins of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) produced virus that replicated in mice but which, unlike the wild-type virus, was non-lethal [17]. Deletion of some, but not all, of the accessory protein genes of feline coronavirus [18] reduced pathogenicity. Removal of accessory protein gene 3 of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus [19] did not reduce its enteropathogenicity. Thus the accessory protein genes of coronaviruses are targets for modification for the purpose of vaccine development, although each gene has to be investigated in its own right. It is becoming increasingly likely that one or more proteins encoded by gene 1 also influence pathogenicity. This stems from our own observations with chimaeric IBV, and those of Sperry et al. [25] with MHV; a single amino acid substitution in nsp14 encoded by gene 1 attenuated pathogenicity for mice. Gene 1, therefore, is another target for manipulation. As we have demonstrated, the extensive antigenic variation of IBV can be addressed by spike-swapping, and our molecularly cloned IBV has potential for the development of a vaccine that can be applied in ovo.",
