Fear arising from the excess or unreliability of information about disease can lead to erratic behaviour, trigger the onset of psychiatric disorders, and even increase rates of suicide [7] .

They are frequently marginalised, do not live in big urban centres, and have limited access to health care services. Beliefs about wellbeing and health can also influence how they seek medical attention. This poses challenges for health systems based on or oriented towards typical European and North American norms and values. Language barriers can intervene between the healthcare providers and indigenous people, whose lifestyles, foods, physical activities, and hygienic practices also vary. The immune profile of indigenous populations can also differ from those of the majority populations living in the same region. Response to a new virus and disease may therefore be unexpected and even deadlier among such minority groups. A high proportion of homeless persons have chronic physical and mental disorders. These persons can be even more overlooked once healthcare services are allocated almost exclusively to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Detection of cases and prevention of disease in a transient population are more difficult. Yet worse is that many countries lack the infrastructure and resources to shelter and assume the care of homeless persons in an eventual quarantine [8] .",

Many of the participants also reported insomnia, and 70 % psychological distress. Women and nurseswho in great proportion were the first responders -were more affected.
