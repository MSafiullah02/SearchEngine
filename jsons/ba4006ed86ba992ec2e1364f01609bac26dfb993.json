Before the SARS outbreak, while it was recognized that the coronavirus infected many different species, particularly domestic and laboratory animals, their extreme diversity in nature was not fully appreciated. Although severe diseases of differing characteristics were known to occur in animals, in humans the viruses were thought to cause only acute respiratory infection which were generally mild. All this changed with the recognition that SARS was caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This signaled that coronaviruses could produce lethal disease and encouraged more broadly based research on the agent and its prevention and control. In the process, two new respiratory or endemic coronaviruses have been identifi ed as causing human infections, which appear to resemble in epidemiologic characteristics those previously known.

Infectious bronchitis virus of chickens was actually isolated in embryonated eggs in the 1940s. The late recognition of these viruses was, in large part, because of diffi culty in recovering the human viruses using standard cell culture techniques [ 4 ] . The fi rst human coronaviruses were identifi ed by different techniques in the United Kingdom and the United States at approximately the same time. The British Medical Research Council's Common Cold Research Unit had been studying fl uids collected from persons with natural respiratory infections by standard cell culture isolation methods and by inoculating them into human volunteers. Rhinoviruses or other cytopathogenic agents could be recovered from a portion of the fl uids [ 5 ] . There was an additional, substantial portion from which no agents could be isolated but that could still cause colds in the volunteers. Organ cultures of human embryonic trachea or nasal epithelium were then used in an effort to detect the recalcitrant viruses present. A specimen, B814, that had been collected in 1960 from a boy with a common cold had not yielded a virus on inoculation into cell culture. After the specimen had been passaged serially three times in human tracheal organ culture, it could still cause colds on inoculation into volun-teers, which indicated that replication had taken place [ 6 ] . In Chicago during the winter of 1962, fi ve agents were isolated in primary human kidney cell cultures from specimens collected from medical students with common colds. The viruses were ultimately adapted to WI-38 cultures and exhibited a type of cytopathic effect (CPE) not previously seen. A prototype strain, 229E, was selected for characterization and was found to be RNA containing, ether labile, and 89 nm in diameter but distinct serologically from any known ortho-or paramyxoviruses. Sera collected from the fi ve medical students all exhibited a fourfold rise in neutralization antibody titer against 229E [ 7 ] . It became clear that these \"novel\" viruses were of more than passing signifi cance when organ culture methods were added to standard cell culture techniques in a study of acute respiratory infections of adults conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Six viruses were found that grew in organ but not cell culture and were ether labile; on electron microscopy, the agents were shown to resemble avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in structure, and these represented a distinct family of viruses [ 8 ] . The B814 and 229E strains were soon also demonstrated to have a similar structure on electron microscopy and to develop in infected cells by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles [ 9 , 10 ] . As a result of the similarity of the human agents to IBV and also to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), they were collectively considered to represent a group of vertebrate viruses distinct from the myxoviruses antigenically and structurally [ 11 ] . The name coronavirus was eventually adopted for the group to describe the fringe of projections seen around them on electron microscopy [ 1 ] . Except for 229E, none of the human coronaviruses had been successfully propagated in a system other than organ culture. McIntosh et al. reported successful adaptation of two of the NIH isolates, OC (organ culture) 38 and OC43, to the brains of suckling mice [ 12 ] . These strains were shown to be essentially identical antigenically but quite distinct from MHV. Only OC38 and OC43 could be so adapted; the other four OC strains resisted such attempts. The IBV was known to exhibit hemagglutination under certain conditions, but no such phenomenon had been demonstrated for the human strains until OC38 and OC43 were adapted to mice. Kaye and Dowdle found that the infected brain preparations would directly and specifi cally agglutinate red cells obtained from chickens, rats, and mice [ 13 ] . This technique greatly expanded the ability to do seroepidemiologic studies, since it was simple and reproducible. Subsequent developments included adaption of OC38 and OC43 to growth in cell monolayers; either mouse brain or organ culture material could be used as sources of virus [ 9 ] . Not only was CPE available for reading of neutralization tests, but also the OC38 and OC43 viruses were found to hemadsorb red cells of rats and mice, making available a more precise means of evaluating endpoints in tests involving these organ culture-derived strains [ 14 ] . The other OC strains and B814 that could not be adapted to mouse brain resisted adaptation to cell culture as well; these distinct viruses have since been lost and may actually have been rediscovered recently.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 363, "end": 368, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 852, "end": 857, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1473, "text": "[ 6 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2091, "end": 2096, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2612, "end": 2617, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2795, "end": 2805, "text": "[ 9 , 10 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3044, "end": 3050, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3189, "end": 3194, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3411, "end": 3413, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3455, "end": 3461, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3984, "end": 3990, "text": "[ 13 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 4276, "end": 4281, "text": "[ 9 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 4552, "end": 4558, "text": "[ 14 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Historical Background"}, {"text": "Work on the coronaviruses of humans proceeded slowly, with debate about how frequently the viruses caused lower rather than upper respiratory disease. The methodological problems of working with them were a major impediment, as was their apparent involvement only in a relatively mild disease. All this changed when in 2002 SARS appeared fi rst in China and then in other countries of the world. The near panic resulted because of its transmission characteristics, case fatality, and the fact that the agent was initially unknown. That last aspect was solved quickly with the identifi cation of the causative agent as a new coronavirus. The knowledge that the virus emerged from a zoonotic reservoir spurred investigation of its possible source. Small mammals (civet cats) in live game-animal markets in Guangdong were identifi ed carrying closely related viruses. This led to the identifi cation of these animals as amplifi er hosts and to the game-animal wet markets as an interface where zoonotic infection of humans was being initiated [ 15 ] . The natural reservoir was later identifi ed to be Chinese horseshoe bats [ 16 , 17 ] . The SARS epidemic ended following the use of various population control measures and unexpectedly has not recurred. However, increased attention to the coronaviruses continued globally. New coronaviruses were identifi ed in various animal hosts, and two additional coronaviruses were identifi ed in humans, the fi rst since 229E and OC43. NL63 was identifi ed in Amsterdam in 2004 from a 7-monthold child with febrile bronchiolitis [ 18 ] . The same virus was also isolated at almost the same time by the group in Rotterdam from an 8-month-old child with pneumonia [ 19 ] . The second virus, HKU1, was detected in a specimen collected from a 71-year-old man from China with pneumonia and then from another adult with the same diagnosis [ 20 ] . With the development of real-time PCR techniques for all four human respiratory coronaviruses, it has now become possible to identify them in many situations. Such identifi cation is now typically done not only for these viruses but also for a variety of other respiratory agents. This has meant that coronaviruses are now detected as much in clinical settings as in epidemiologic studies. now recognized in those who might previously have not been studied. This has especially been the case in hospitalized individuals, particularly those who will likely experience severe outcomes, such as the immunocompromised. It is also known from earlier studies that coronavirus frequently infects small children and reinfects adults, including persons with chronic respiratory disease [ 21 ] . It would be logical to assume that deaths could occur in these most susceptible segments of the population, but they are probably not very frequent.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1040, "end": 1046, "text": "[ 15 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1133, "text": "[ 16 , 17 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1574, "text": "[ 18 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1701, "end": 1707, "text": "[ 19 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1872, "end": 1878, "text": "[ 20 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2658, "end": 2664, "text": "[ 21 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Historical Background"}, {"text": "A problem during SARS was in defi ning the specifi city of infection, whether inapparent, mild, or fatal. This was related to the lack of a readily available diagnostic test in many areas where outbreaks occurred. To a large extent, cases were classifi ed using a clinical case defi nition. In some cases that survived, there was an attempt at serological confi rmation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Historical Background"}, {"text": "Since the coronaviruses of humans, other than the SARS virus, usually produce illnesses indistinguishable from those caused by other respiratory viruses, it is not possible to defi ne morbidity in the absence of laboratory identifi cation. Before PCR became available, it was diffi cult directly to identify the infecting virus; thus, besides anecdotal reports, most of the epidemiologic studies were based on identifying rises in antibody titer. In contrast, since development of the PCR technique, direct identifi cation has become relatively simple. However, this seeming advance has often been accompanied by the use of the method to determine the incidence of infection in population groups and to defi ne characteristics of associated disease or even seasonality. The major problem is the short duration of many of the available studies and the concentration on hospitalized individuals. As a result, while it is possible to say these viruses can sometimes cause hospitalization and to infer the particular clinical diagnoses they produce, it is diffi cult to estimate what proportion of overall illnesses are severe. A small number of studies have been population based and have produced the only data available for determining the overall impact of illness [ 22 -24 ] . While the older population-based studies were limited to 229E, OC43, or both, they are useful since there are few recent investigations that give the same information. They were conducted in different settings but in some cases contemporaneously which allows direct comparison. In fact, almost no studies include all four recognized coronaviruses and cover more than a single year. This makes it diffi cult to discuss year-to-year variation in frequency of activity as well as seasonality, as was possible with the older data. Such studies are therefore of continuing interest, at least as background, in determining the long-term occurrence of the viruses. These original investigations were typically broadly based, with coronavirus infection forming part of overall evaluations of the role of viruses in general in respiratory illnesses. As indicated in the selected listing in Table 10 .1 , a variety of different open and closed populations were used for these studies. The 229E strain was originally isolated from medical students in Chicago as part of a long-term study of respiratory illnesses in young adults [ 7 , 25 ] . Employee groups were the source of specimens in the NIH [ 26 , 27 ] and in the studies at Charlottesville, Virginia [ 30 ] . Infection was also evaluated in children's homes [ 28 ] and boarding schools [ 5 ] , among military recruits [ 34 ] , and among children hospitalized for severe respiratory illnesses in various parts of the world [ 26 ] . Serological methods were used to detect occurrence in persons with acute exacerbations of asthma [ 33 ] or chronic obstructive respiratory disease [ 21 ] . Patterns of coronavirus infection were identifi ed among the general population residing in the Tecumseh, Michigan, community as part of a longitudinal study of respiratory illness [ 31 , 32 ] . Also included in Table 10 .1 are more recent studies using PCR to identify infection. The previous studies, based on serology, often did not characterize infections identifi ed clinically; in fact, challenge studies of volunteers were employed early, to determine characteristics of illnesses, because of problems associated with direct isolation [ 35 , 36 ] . The more recent studies were able to characterize the illnesses clinically but have other limitations as indicated above.

A special situation was determining the meaning of the presence in man of antibody against coronaviruses of animals. The fi nding of mouse hepatitis antibodies in military recruits and in children and adults from the general population was surprising when fi rst described in 1964 [ 38 ] . It is now recognized that this did not indicate past experience with MHV but rather with human coronavirus strains known to crossreact with it. Similarly, antibodies in human sera against the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine and the coronavirus of calf diarrhea also appear to represent crossreactions with OC43 or related strains [ 29 , 39 ] . In contrast, in a survey of antibodies to avian IBV, none could be found in a military population. Low-level antibodies were detected only in a portion of subjects who had close contact with poultry [ 40 ] . The virus is not known to cross-react with the human strains. More recently, following a gap in active work on the epidemiology of coronaviruses, ELISA methods have been developed for at least some of the viruses [ 41 , 42 ] .

Relevant specimens for virus detection are typically respiratory specimens, such as nasopharyngeal aspirates, washes or swabs, nose or throat swabs, and, when available, endotracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavages. In the case of SARS, in which disseminated infection may occur, viral RNA could also readily be detected in the feces and in the serum or plasma. Although PCR-based methods are becoming the \"gold standard\" in diagnosis, virus isolation is indispensable for characterizing virus, studying pathogenesis, determining susceptibility to antivirals, and developing novel antivirals and vaccines. The human coronavirus 229E was originally isolated in cell culture and later adapted to roller culture monolayers of human embryonic lung fi broblast cells such as WI-38 and MRC-5. A cytopathic effect of small, granular, round cells appears at the periphery of the cell monolayer [ 7 ] .

In the children hospitalized with lower respiratory disease, up to 10 % of illnesses during this period were associated with such a titer rise. However, it was impossible to show that the relationship to disease was truly etiologic. This fi nding was in contrast to that seen with 229E, in which no rises in titer were detected in such cases [ 27 , 111 ] . In the Tecumseh study, occurrence of OC43 infection was determined in the community population over a 4-year period: CF and HI tests were used on all specimens, and N tests were used as an aid in evaluating these results in selected specimens. During the total period, OC43-related infection was detected in 17.1 % of the 910 persons studied for 1 year. Most of the infections took place in the winter-spring months of 1965-1966, 1967-1968, and 1968-1969 . The only winter-spring period without such activity was in 1966-1967, when the 229E outbreak had taken place. The 1968-1969 outbreak of OC43 infection was nearly as widespread as the prior 229E outbreak, with 25.6 % of the population studied showing evidence of infection. Of special note was the fact that children under 5 years of age had the highest infection rates [ 32 , 112 ] . More recently, in the Edinburgh study involving medical care, OC43 was the most commonly identifi ed coronavirus but only was identifi ed by PCR in 0.85 % of specimens. This again may be a refl ection of the source of the specimens. Surveys of antibody prevalence have been conducted in several settings using OC43 antigens. McIntosh et al. [ 27 ] found that children began to acquire antibody to this virus in the fi rst year of life. By the third year of life, more than 50 % had antibody present. Among adults, 69 % could be demonstrated to have antibody; this indicates, in view of the high incidence of infection with the agents in all age groups, the frequency with which such infections must represent reinfection. The high prevalence of antibody has been confi rmed in other studies [ 28 , 30 , 112 ] . In Britain, Bradburne and Somerset followed prevalence of antibody for OC43 over time, as they also had done with 229E [ 36 ] . Each year, the greatest prevalence of antibody was found in the winter-spring period. The single highest point in antibody prevalence was in January-March 1969, at the same time the OC43 outbreak was occurring in some parts of the United States [ 30 , 38 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 174, "text": "[ 107 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 771, "end": 778, "text": "[ 107 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1131, "text": "[ 30 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1784, "end": 1796, "text": "[ 27 , 111 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2218, "end": 2253, "text": "1965-1966, 1967-1968, and 1968-1969", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2625, "end": 2637, "text": "[ 32 , 112 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2981, "end": 2987, "text": "[ 27 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3431, "end": 3448, "text": "[ 28 , 30 , 112 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3570, "end": 3576, "text": "[ 36 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3824, "end": 3835, "text": "[ 30 , 38 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Incidence and Prevalence of OC43 Virus"}, {"text": "Occurrence of coronavirus infection has now been documented, by isolation, PCR, or serology, throughout the world.

The reversal of the pattern of age-specifi c infection rates customarily associated with the respiratory viruses becomes complete with 229E.

In Tecumseh, during the 1966-1967 outbreak, highest agespecifi c infection rates by CF were found among those 15-29 years of age, following a steady increase in infection frequency from the 0-to 4-year-olds. However, when neutralization tests were used to detect infection, the 15-to 19-year-olds still had high infection rates, but the serial increase to that point among younger age groups was much less steep [ 31 ] .

The recent identifi cation of a novel coronavirus gives increased urgency to this need; it is likely that an anticoronavirus drug would be of use whatever the particular type involved. Overall, the epidemiologic lesson to be learned from SARS is the need for good surveillance at the animal-human interface. The virus was probably transmitting locally from human to human for months before it escaped to the rest of the world. If this had been recognized, there could have been earlier efforts to contain spread, which was effectively accomplished later, but only after much damage had been done.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Unresolved Problems"}, {"text": "The emergence of a novel MERS coronavirus with potential to cause severe human disease, though so far originating in the Middle East and manifesting limited human-to-human transmission including transmission within health-care facilities, is reminiscent of the emergence of SARS and is a concern for global public health [ 120 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 321, "end": 328, "text": "[ 120 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Unresolved Problems"}, {"text": "The numbers of laboratory-confi rmed patients with MERS continues to increase with 837 laboratory confi rmed cases and 291 deaths being reported to WHO as of 23 July 2014.

All cases so far have a link to the Middle East with primary human infections reported from Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

However, in a large number of human cases, there appears to be no record of a history of contact with camels.

The geographic distribution of MERS-CoV infection in camels (including North East Africa) is wider than that reported in primary human cases reported so far. It remains to be seen whether this represents under-recognition of human cases in a wider geographic area. MERS-CoV antibodies have been detected in archived dromedary sera collected over two decades ago [ 226 ] , and this may indicate that MERS is a recently recognised, rather than a newly emerging, disease.
