Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in three databases up until March 2020 (PROSPERO registration nr CRD42019126764). Results N = 5 studies including 438 participants (age 48-80) with body mass index C 25 kg/m 2 met the eligibility criteria and were included. The duration of the interventions ranged from 8 to 24 weeks. No study measured the primary outcome VAT, although in N = 4 studies, waist circumference (WC) decreased by between 1.3 and 5.6 cm in the intervention groups. Conclusions This systematic review shows that there is no evidence for the effects of digital exercise on VAT, although digital exercise may decrease WC. These findings highlight the need for additional randomized controlled trials to confirm the findings with respect to WC, and to further investigate the effects of digital exercise on VAT. Together, this may have important implications for reducing the burden of physical inactivity and obesity.",

Specifically, central obesity which is characterized by an excessive deposition of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in the abdominal cavity has been more strongly associated with CVD and mortality than general obesity (Sahakyan et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2016; Yusuf et al. 2005 ). It has also been shown that improving modifiable risk factors for CVD may also reduce further comorbidities later in life including disability and frailty (Atkins et al. 2019) .",

Therefore, there is a need to explore novel approaches for promoting physical activity (PA) to counteract the detrimental effects of insufficient activity and obesity and their economic burden (Ding et al. 2016; Oldridge 2008; Withrow and Alter 2011) . Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the Internet users (Internet Society 2017) and subsequently a rise also in the number of digital health interventions. The previous reviews have concluded that digital health interventions may have positive effects on outcomes such as PA and quality of life (Cotie et al. 2018; Foster et al. 2013; Geraedts et al. 2013; Jahangiry et al. 2017; Sch\u00e4fer et al. 2018) , and among the unique advantages of these interventions are cost-efficiency, accessibility and convenience, including 24-h access to intervention material (Joseph et al. 2014; Lewis et al. 2010; Oh et al. 2005; World Health Organization 2016) . In light of this, digital tools (e.g., web-based or smart device applications) may be plausible for delivering wide-spread, effective and cost-efficient exercise interventions in a home-based setting.",

The CG received a brochure with information about health and exercise while the IG performed three exercise sessions for eight weeks, where each session lasted 50-60 min. The exercise program consisted of both endurance-and strength exercise and participants accessed the program at home using an online platform. There, they subscribed to a website where the exercise program in terms of online videos was available. In addition, they were instructed to report at the website following completion of a session, and they were also reminded not to forget to follow the exercise program. David et al. (2012) randomized participants to an IG and a CG. Both groups were offered a 12-week walking intervention and provided pedometers as well as an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system through mobile phones. Participants were given step goals based on their baseline level of PA. These daily targets were progressively and individually increased so that participants would reach 10,000 steps/day. Each day participants received messages through their phones, in addition to answering automated calls from the IVR systems. Within the scope of the calls, participants would answer whether they had completed their daily step goal, their self-efficacy toward Digital exercise interventions for improving measures of central obesity: a systematic review completing the daily goal and how their day had been in general. The only difference between the groups was that the IG had the possibility to contact a coach through the IVR system, although these interactions were not compulsory for the participants. Thus, the authors of the study reported the effects on the outcome measures for all participants combined together, rather as separate effects in each group. Pressler et al. (2010) originally randomized participants to an intervention IG and a CG. In the present review, only the IG was assessed as the participants in the CG received an all too similar intervention as the IG, hence, an appropriate comparison with the IG was not possible and justified. The intervention consisted of a 12-week long individually planned and structured exercise program delivered as an interactive web-calendar. Using the calendar, participants could choose from a variety of workouts. Each week, they would perform three moderate-intensity endurance workouts and one strength training session, with each session lasting between 30 and 70 min. Exercise intensity was prescribed as 60-70% of maximum heart rate and based on baseline assessments. Participants also documented their heart rate on the interactive platform. Individual weekly goals were also established.",

The highest risk of bias resulted from 'other bias', in terms of the absence of direct techniques for measuring central obesity which was the case for 100% of the included studies. Similarly, 60% of the studies did not state whether the outcome assessment was blinded or not. Additionally, in one study Akinci et al. (2018) , there was a high risk of attrition bias given that inappropriate methods were employed for handling missing data, resulting in potentially over-estimated effects. Also, data on changes in body fat were not reported in this study despite stated in the pre-registered study protocol. While these values would have been of benefit to the present review, unfortunately, they were not reported. This would have been of value for the present systematic review and thereby resulted in a high risk of reporting bias. Blinding of participants was either not performed or sufficiently described in 60% of the studies. In general, blinding is not possible in exercise trials due to participants usually being aware of whether they receive the intervention or not. For this reason, the studies that did not address blinding were therefore not considered as a source of high risk of bias in the present systematic review.",

            "text": "The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the existing literature and provide an overview of the potential benefits of digital exercise interventions for improving measures of central obesity. We found that the potential benefits of digital exercise for decreasing VAT have not yet been investigated. However, in four studies, WC decreased by between 1.3 and 5.6 cm in the IGs. In addition, there were a few positive, albeit inconsistent, findings on overall obesity-related outcomes including BMI, BW and body fat. Since 1980, the prevalence of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries (Afshin et al. 2017) , and it is projected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future (Ward et al. 2019) . At the same time, physical inactivity has been labeled as a pandemic (Kohl et al. 2012) , and recent reports show no signs of improvements for the past 15 years (Guthold et al. 2018) . With this in mind, the current rapid growth in the number of internet users (Internet Society 2017) could offer potential advantages in terms of prevention and treatment, as the World Health Organization has proposed that digital health interventions should be further developed and implemented to support individual health and health care systems (World Health Organization 2016). Previous reviews have reported inconsistent findings in terms of the effects of digital health interventions on obesity-related outcomes (Cotie et al. 2018; Seo and Niu 2015) . A limitation in these reviews is that they did not formalize their criteria to include exerciseonly interventions, which is essential in order to elucidate the exercise-specific effects on obesity-related outcomes. To our knowledge, this was the first systematic review to evaluate the potential benefits of digital exercise-only interventions for improving measures of central obesity. The findings highlight the importance of employing measures of obesity beyond BMI when evaluating changes in body composition following digital exercise interventions. Specifically, we observed more inconsistent findings on BMI compared to WC, which is supported by previous meta-analyses which have shown that supervised exercise interventions may effectively improve measures of central obesity in terms of reducing VAT and WC despite the absence of significant weight loss (Vissers et al. 2013; Wewege et al. 2017 ). While we were unable to determine the benefits of digital exercise for decreasing VAT, it is nonetheless promising that the present review suggests that digital exercise may decrease WC in the absence of a hypocaloric diet. This likely also has clinical relevance given that measures of central obesity are better indicators of health outcomes than BMI (Czernichow et al. 2011; Nordstr\u00f6m et al. 2016) , and have been associated with increased risk of CVD and mortality (Czernichow et al. 2011; Onat et al. 2004; Rexrode et al. 1998) , even in normal-weight individuals (Sahakyan et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2016) . In a pooled analysis of 11 prospective studies including 650,000 adults and over 78,000 deaths, it was shown that 5 cm increments in WC increased the relative risk of mortality by 7-9% across a wide range of BMI categories (Cerhan et al. 2014) . Similarly, when changes in WC were studied in relation to all-cause and CVD-mortality, 5 cm increments in WC was associated with a 51% and 84% increased relative risk of all-cause and CVDmortality in men during a follow-up period of 16 years (Mulligan et al. 2019) . For women, the relative risks for the same outcomes were 25% and 15%, respectively. Even smaller increments may also have clinical significance as demonstrated in a meta-regression analysis where as little as 1 cm increment in WC was associated with increased risk of CVD (de Koning et al. 2007) . To this end, interventions that can improve measures of central obesity clearly has important implications, although when interpreting the findings from the present review it is critical to consider that merely five studies were included in this review, and none of these measured VAT directly. It would therefore be valuable if future studies aim for objective measurements of central obesity.",

Specifically, provision of digital health applications may be a cost-efficient way to intervene on the declining physical fitness of people living in rural communities (Ekblom-Bak et al. 2019) , and thus should be of interest to health care providers and stakeholders. In this sense, it is interesting that a recent systematic review of 22 studies on older people reported a very high adherence rate, around 90%, to digital exercise interventions, although the interventions included some level of supervision (Valenzuela et al. 2018) . Thus, while that adherence rate clearly contradicts those reported in the present review, it suggests that future studies that aim to investigate remotely administered, unsupervised digital exercise interventions need to be carefully planned and developed to promote adherence. Indeed, digital health applications can both incorporate adequate behavior-change approaches to increase user motivation as well as provide tailored interventional strategies and techniques, for instance goal-setting, to help increase engagement with the intervention (Ng et al. 2012) . To this end, using digital technology to promote motivation and behavior change through tailoring, the intervention to the individual user and moving beyond the one-size-fits-all strategy could potentially result in higher adherence and consequently larger effects, although this warrants further confirmation (Horner et al. 2017; Tate et al. 2015) .",

Thus, additional high-quality randomized controlled trials with a more similar design are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. Future trials should also employ longer interventions as this may result in larger effects (Clark 2016) , which would be valuable in order to make inferences on sustained long-term benefits. Furthermore, none of the included studies objectively measured VAT. This would be valuable in order to explore the benefits of digital exercise on measures of central obesity more accurately, as WC alone may be an insufficient measure of central obesity given its inability to differentiate visceral from subcutaneous adiposity (Despr\u00e9s et al. 2008) . Objective measurements also facilitate the detection of small changes in obese individuals (Shuster et al. 2012) whereas anthropometric surrogates can be difficult to apply in these individuals with respect to their body shape, thus risking impaired precision in outcome assessment. Also, as reflected in our bias assessment, it was unclear whether all outcome assessments were blinded or not, and it is possible that this may have influenced the results of the WC measurements. Finally, additional studies would also enable future subgroup analyses based on key factors e.g., intervention specifics; duration; measurement tools; degree of obesity; and sex. Especially, considering that there appears to be sex-specific responses to exercise in terms of visceral and total fat loss (Kuk and Ross 2009; Link and Reue 2017) .",

            "text": "The strengths of the present study include a systematic and well-conceptualized methodology, pre-registration of the study protocol and independent assessment of eligible studies and bias assessment. This systematic review is also timely in an era where the health care is becoming more digitalized (Kostkova 2015) and the prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity remains high. Furthermore, despite that a healthy diet is a well-established cornerstone in the treatment of obesity (Jensen et al. 2014) , evaluating the unique effects pertaining to exercise is a strength and may have other advantages. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and for some people, it may be easier to start an exercise regime than to change their dietary habits. By starting to exercise, one could also potentially experience positive spin-off effects, as shown in a recent study where 12 weeks of exercise decreased wanting scores for high-fat foods and trait binge eating in overweight and obese individuals (Beaulieu et al. 2020) . Finally, in this review, we have highlighted the fact that while many digital health applications promoting physical activity exist on the market today, very few have been tested in controlled studies (Byambasuren et al. 2018) . It is therefore of interest to not only develop novel and innovative digital solutions, but essentially, they need to be evaluated. Specifically, this review exposes a gap in the field of research on studies evaluating the effectiveness of digital exercise interventions for reducing central obesity both in the short and long term as no studies have not factored in the key indicator VAT into their design and development.",

This review highlights the need for additional randomized controlled trials to confirm the findings with respect to WC, and further investigate the effects of digital exercise on VAT. Given the pandemic of physical inactivity and obesity, this area of research has high relevance with potentially important implications in the strive toward reducing the incidence of their associated complications and economic burden.",
