            "text": "Introduction: Children's Hospital Colorado is an academic, tertiary-care Level 1 Trauma Center with an emergency department (ED) that treats >70,000 patients/year. Patient volumes continue to increase, leading to worsening wait times and left-without-beingseen (LWBS) rates. In 2015, the ED's median door-to-provider time was 49 minutes [interquartile range (IQR) = 26-90], with a 3.2% LWBS rate. ED leadership, staff, and providers aimed to improve patient flow with specific goals to (1) decrease door-to-provider times to a median of <30 minutes and (2) decrease annual LWBS rate to <1%. Methods: An inter-professional team utilized quality improvement and Lean methodology to study, redesign, and implement significant changes to ED front-end processes. Key process elements included (1) new Flow Nurse/EMT roles, (2) elimination of traditional registration and triage processes, (3) immediate \"quick registration\" and nurse assessment upon walk-in, (4) direct-bedding of patients, and (5) a novel \"Intake\" system staffed by a pediatric emergency medicine physician. Results: In the 12 months following full implementation of the new front-end system, the median door-to-provider time decreased 49% to 25 minutes (IQR = 13-50), and the LWBS rate decreased from 3.2% to 1.4% (a 56% relative decrease). Additionally, the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes of arrival increased, overall ED length-of-stay decreased, patient satisfaction improved, and no worsening of the unexpected 72-hour return rate occurred. Conclusions: Using quality improvement and Lean methodology, an inter-professional team decreased door-to-provider times and LWBS rates in a large pediatric ED by redesigning its front-end processes and implementing a novel pediatric emergency medicine-led Intake system.",

            "text": "Patient crowding is a problem facing emergency departments (ED) worldwide. [1] [2] [3] Causes of crowding include increased use of EDs, patient boarding in the ED, increased patient complexity, and inefficient ED operations. 4 Crowding leads to longer wait times to see providers, patient safety concerns, worse outcomes in certain clinical scenarios, and decreased patient satisfaction. 2, 5, 6 There is an increased national focus on this important health topic, with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid services identifying multiple operational metrics as key to evaluating the quality of care provided in an ED. 7 The American Academy of Pediatrics also recognizes this as a particular problem affecting the care of pediatric patients in the ED and in 2015 published a report outlining best practices for patient flow and care for these patients. 8 A key driver of ED patient flow is its \"front-end system,\" consisting of all the operational steps that occur before a provider sees the patient. Strategies employed to improve the front-end processes include the abolishment of traditional nurse-led triage, \"split-flow\" models that create separate patient streams depending on each individual's particular care needs, direct-bedding of patients, and placing providers in triage. [8] [9] [10] [11] A Physician in Triage and other models utilizing non-physician providers can decrease door-to-provider times and decrease left-without-being-seen (LWBS) rates. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Most reports of patient flow improvements come from general EDs, where the majority of patients are adults; thus, there are few reports of how similar strategies may impact pediatric-focused EDs. 19, 20 Children's Hospital Colorado has seen increased patient volumes and LWBS rates since moving into a new hospital in 2008 (Fig. 1 ). In 2016, the ED leaders, staff, and providers wanted to improve patient flow via a large-scale front-end system redesign. The purpose of this report is to share the change process, specific operational changes implemented, and the resulting impact on patient flow in this tertiary-care pediatric ED.",

The team observed the process during this initial trial and made changes both in real-time and at the Day 5 session.

This project shows that by utilizing Lean methodology, QI principles, and knowledge of ED operational principles, a large pediatric ED can realize similar patient flow improvements to those seen in adult systems.

The original front-end system was inefficient as it included many non-value-added processes leading to frequent patient flow bottlenecks due to queueing theory. Merely adding staff to this inefficient system would not have made a meaningful improvement in patient flow. By decreasing the number of front-end steps (namely the discontinuation of nurse-led triage and the implementing direct-bedding), the new system allows for a decreased door-to-provider time by removing non-value-added steps rather than increased staff. The newly developed PEM-led Intake system is an adjunct to this more efficient system and allows for earlier initiation of care and saves critical ED bed space by facilitating rapid discharge of patients who need no further care. Direct-bedding is a strategy frequently found in other front-end redesigns to help reduce door-to-provider times. 9, 24 It is a critical component in the success of our new front-end system but has challenges when the ED is full, and direct-bedding is no longer an option. At these times, we must enact backup processes to bring a nurse or EMT from the main ED to the waiting room to obtain vital signs and initiate standing orders. Also, in certain situations, patients previously assigned to a direct bed status may be seen in Intake by the PEM physician when there is no ED capacity. These backup processes ensure patient care continues despite the lack of room availability.",
