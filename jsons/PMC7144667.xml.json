With the increasing knowledge of the clinical progress of COVID-19 cases, the timing of invasive ventilation changed. As indicated by CT results,9 5\u20138 days after onset of initial symptoms the infection rapidly aggravated and extended to a bilateral multi-lobar pulmonary effusion and consolidation. Although noninvasive ventilation temporarily improves oxygenation in COVID-19 patients, it may not necessarily change the natural course of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).10 On February 18, 2020, the state council of China issued \u2018Question and answers of tracheal intubation for novel coronavirus pneumonia cases\u2019, in which the criteria for tracheal intubation were defined as oxygenation index <150 mm Hg after at least 2 h of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with 100% oxygen, and it was recommended that intubation be scheduled rather than emergent. According to the new criteria, patients would receive intubation and ventilation therapy earlier. As a result, more patients needed intubation. In many hospitals, airway management teams consisting of skilled anaesthesiologists were established to meet the need for intubation.",

With adequate pre-oxygenation, bag-mask ventilation can ideally be avoided. CPAP with 100% oxygen for 5 min is recommended for pre-oxygenation. If available, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) delivery systems can be used for pre-oxygenation, although these can increase the risk of viral spread through aerosol generation.13 To minimise this risk, the mouth and nose of the patient can be covered with normal saline saturated gauze during pre-oxygenation. To avoid agitation and cough, intubations are best done using a rapid sequence intubation technique.11 12 Midazolam, propofol, and etomidate can be used depending on the patient\u2019s condition. After sedation, at least 0.9 mg kg\u20131 of rocuronium or 1 mg kg\u20131 of succinylcholine should be used. A hydrophobic filter should be attached to the resuscitation bag, between the mask or tracheal tube (TT) and the bag. When difficult airway is anticipated, flexible bronchoscopic intubation can be performed using a videobronchoscope. Awake fibreoptic intubation should be avoided to decrease exposure to aerosols.12 If unanticipated difficult airway occurs, an intubating LMA and surgical airway can be considered.",

Besides Wuhan, many other areas could also have many infected people. Thus, anaesthesiologists play an essential and demanding role in the preoperative evaluation of COVID-19 infection risk (Supplemental Digital Content 2 shows a fast triage flowchart). At present, suspicion for infection with COVID-19 requires two symptoms with an epidemiological link, or three without epidemiological link.19 Epidemiological links include travel within 14 days to affected areas, or close contact within 14 days of illness onset with a confirmed patient, or close contact with a person having fever and respiratory symptoms and travel to an affected area within 14 days of illness onset.19 Fever may not be present in all patients. The absence of fever in COVID-19 is more frequent than in SARS and MERS, so appropriate infectious control precautions should be in place even in those without typical symptoms.22 With the spread of the virus to more areas and countries, anaesthesiologists all over the world may face the challenge of weighing the risk of infection and the need for medical care of patients.",
