Recently, bioactive or biodegradable metals have attracted great attention in research and development (R&D) of biomaterials for clinical applications [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Our recent clinical work showed that the bone grafting fixation using biodegradable pure Mg screw was beneficial for successful fixation of bony flap used for treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in patients with steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) where bony flap displacement was avoided and local bone density was increased accompanied by Mg-screw degradation, partially explained by the biologic effects of degraded Mg ions, yet like many available related clinical studies the scientific or mechanistic evidence was lacking [5].",

The occurrence of SAON is highly associated with the dosage and duration usage of CS. The incidence of ONFH was 0.7%\u201333% with CS treatment [9]. High dose of CS treatment for SLE even induced 44% SAON in the hips and knees [10]. Osteonecrosis (ON) may subsequently progress to joint collapse and eventually require total joint replacement [6,11]. So, it is highly desirable to study the pathogenesis of SAON and potential biomaterials established to attenuate SAON and promote the repair of SAON in early stage to prevent SAON induced joint collapse.",

Clinical evidences suggested that excess CS treatment in patients could induce lower serum magnesium (Mg) [16]. Animal models and human studies revealed that Mg deficiency was associated with osteoporosis [17], lipid metabolism [18] and vascular damage [19], which are correlated with the mechanisms of SAON. So, we hypothesized that Mg supplementation might alleviate Mg deficiency induced bone deterioration, disordered lipid metabolism and vascular damage and then attenuate SAON.",

Co-staining of ZO-1 and NF-\u03baB p65 showed that in the control group, the HUVEC monolayer displayed a cobblestone pattern of the ZO-1 tight junction, and p65 were mainly stayed at cytoplasm. When treated with LPS, some ZO-1 proteins left apart from cell-cell junction and accumulated into nucleus, and the p65 of the same cells were coincidentally activated into nucleus.

There is also association between hypomagnesemia and CS therapy [45], consistent with our clinical data showing lower serum Mg level in SAON patients being treated with CS. The normal adult reference value for serum Mg may vary slightly among different laboratories. A large cross-sectional study in Germany identified hypomagnesaemia if serum Mg levels <0.76 mmol/L; and subclinical Mg deficiency, based on serum Mg levels <0.80 mmol/L, is a crisis for many metabolic diseases [46]. Our data suggested that CS treatment could induce Mg deficiency, and the lower serum Mg level was associated with the duration of CS therapy. It is a limitation in our clinical data analysis that all serum data are from ON patients and normal serum Mg level from ON patients without CS treatment was used as reference for the current study instead of using our own normal health control. In the current SAON rat model, results showed significantly lower serum Mg in SAON group at both week 2 and week 6 when compared to normal group, and Mg supplementation elevated the serum Mg level to normal level, which is a novel finding of the current study, suggesting potential clinical significance. There are multifactorial causes of Mg deficiency in patients with CS treatment, including disease determined, low Mg intake, and increased urinary loss of Mg which is a side-effect of CS therapy [16,45].",

CS treatment could induce insulin resistance by decreasing the activity of osteoblast and decease the secretion of osteocalcin from osteoblast [12,47] as osteocalcin positively regulate insulin sensitivity [48]. Evidence suggested that insulin resistance caused hypomagnesemia mainly due to renal Mg wasting, and Mg deficiency further aggravated insulin resistance [49] as Mg is important for maintaining the affinity of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase for ATP [50]. Osteocalcin can stimulate angiogenesis [51] while insulin resistance impaired angiogenesis [52] so as the blood flow resulting in hypoxia and consequently SAON. For lipid metabolism, insulin resistance could impair lipoprotein transportation and increase visceral fat and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) [53], thus resulting in hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis. The increased thrombosis and blood pressure reduce blood flow [54], contributing to the development of SAON as well. Clinically, hypomagnesemia is positively associated with metabolically obese normal weight phenotypes, e.g., hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance in the non-obese individuals [55], and Mg supplementation improves insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic cases to benefit their body metabolism [56].",

Clinically, systemic inflammation diseases such as SLE is known with higher incidence of SAON [10]. Of note, LPS treatment alone could also induce ON [58], and inflammatory diseases could develop ON even without CS treatment [59]. It was reported that Mg supplementation had anti-inflammatory effect clinically [60], and experimentally in vivo and in vitro [61]. Inflammation could decrease osteoblastic bone formation, increase apoptosis of osteoblast and osteocytes, and increase osteoclastic bone resorption [62] to deteriorate the repair progress of SAON. Furthermore, inflammation could increase the permeability of endothelia cells to increase the leakage of blood vessels and edema and pain within the lesions [63]. Our in vivo results suggested that Mg supplementation could decrease the apoptosis of osteocytes, increase the osteoblast surface and decrease the osteoclast number, decrease the small-sized blood leakage in yellow bone marrow region, which were associated with its anti-inflammatory effect locally and systemically. Our in vitro results indicated that Mg could promote osteoblast differentiation under LPS treatment through anti NF-\u03baB regulated inflammation pathway. It was reported that NF-\u03baB inhibitor could abrogate osteoclast formation [64], consistently our study showed that Mg could inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vivo and in vitro. Our in vitro results suggested that both LPS and RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation through NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, and Mg could inhibit osteoclast differentiation and function through suppressing NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Our results also suggested that Mg could reduce endothelial cell leakage induced by LPS in vitro through suppressing NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. It was reported that Ca ions influx was necessary for NF-\u03baB activation and translocation to nuclear in both macrophages [65] and endothelial cells [66]. Influx of extracellular Ca2+ via TRPV4/5 (Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V members) channels in cell membrane was also necessary in RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation [67,68]. Our results showed that both LPS and RANKL could induce Ca2+ influx which could be blocked by Mg supplementation, suggesting that Mg could suppressing NF-\u03baB signaling pathway through inhibiting extracellular Ca2+ influx, which was the potential underlining mechanisms of the effect of Mg on anti-inflammation and inhibiting osteoclast differentiation induced by the two kinds of inducers LPS and RANKL and then attenuating SAON in the current study (Fig. 3C).",

In contrast, Mg has anabolic effect as Mg ions is involved in ATP synthesis in the mitochondria to regulate energy metabolism and intracellular protein synthesis [70]. Our in vitro study showed that Mg could increase IGF-1 expression in osteoblast cell line under MPS treatment. Consistently, our in vivo study also showed that Mg/VC could increase IGF-1 expression in bone marrow 6 weeks after SAON induction. Acute injury might induce local IGF-1 expression related from inflammation to reparation [71], so the IGF-1 expression in bone marrow region in SAON group was not found decreased at week 2. IGF-1 expression was reported inversely associated with malnutrition and osteoporosis [72] and bone marrow fat clinically [73], which were consistently with our in vivo IHC results at week 6 after SAON induction. IGF-1 is an anabolic hormone inversely related to inflammatory markers (i.e., TNF-\u03b1) and oxidative stress [74]. IGF-1 can promote osteoblast cell growth and differentiation through mitochondrial energy metabolism pathways to stimulate bone formation [75]. Also, IGF-1 can stimulate angiogenesis [76]. Clinical evidence showed that the Mg level was strongly and independently associated with total IGF-1 level in the elderly [77]. Previous study showed that Mg supplementation could significantly increase IGF-1 level in Mg-deficient rats [78]. Therefore, the anabolic effect of Mg through increasing IGF-1 signaling pathway could have beneficial effect to antagonize the side-effect of CS treatment and then attenuate the development of SAON.",

            "text": "Compared with the effects of Mg supplementation, VC had more significant effect on promoting osteoblast differentiation, evidenced by osteoblast surface, serum bone formation marker (PINP) and ex vivo osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In our in vitro study, the effect of Mg on osteoblast was controversial, because different cell culture conditions could lead to different results. Our study showed that Mg promoted osteoblast differentiation in the MPS/LPS inhibition condition due to its anabolic effect through promoting IGF-1 pathway and anti-inflammation effect through inhibiting NF-\u03baB pathway. Our results showed that 10  mM Mg in cell culture medium could promote early stage of osteoblast differentiation while inhibit late stage mineralization (Fig. S4). For the mineralization, calcium deposition in the extracellular matrix (ECM) was from intracellular calcium-containing vesicles transported to the ECM [79]. High Mg could inhibit calcium resorption by osteoblast to inhibit mineralization. In order to show the promoting effect, 10  mM Mg was supplemented at early stage of osteoblast differentiation before mineralization in the present study. When \u03b2-glycerophosphate was added to induce mineralization at late stage of osteoblast differentiation, no more high concentration of Mg was added in the cell culture medium. Using Mg free DMEM medium (SH30262.01, HYCLONE, USA), we found that when the Mg was supplemented at whole osteoblast differentiation processing, the best mineralization was from 0.8  mM Mg condition (normal concentration), which matched with the in vivo study that Mg supplementation could promote osteoblast in MPS/LPS induced lower Mg condition. Osteoblast differentiation includes three stages: BMSC to preosteoblast, osteoblast maturation and mineralization. The ex vivo cell culture of BMSCs in same osteogenic cell culture medium reflects the different osteogenic differentiation potentials of BMSCs to preosteoblasts among groups of rats. Our results suggested that VC could promote the potential of osteogenesis of BMSCs, the first stage of osteoblast differentiation, while Mg showed no significant effect at this stage, although Mg showed significant effect in promoting osteogenesis on osteoblast maturation at later stage, evidenced by in vivo histomorphometry of osteoblast surface and in vitro osteoblast differentiation. The results of quantification of osteoclast number in ex vivo cell culture and in vivo histomorphometry were consistent in the same trend that VC did not increase osteoclast number. The inconsistence was osteoclast activity showed by TRAP staining of ex vivo cell culture and in vivo histology. The inconsistence is because of the different osteoclast differentiation conditions between ex vivo and in vivo. For the ex vivo cell culture, the BMMs of rats from each group were cultured in the same osteoclast differentiation medium, the results just showed the potential of osteoclastogenesis of BMMs. While for the in vivo condition, early studies reported that the osteoclast differentiation was affected by many factors, e.g., inflammation and oxidative injury could induce osteoclast differentiation [80,81]. Refer to our in vivo IHC staining results, VC had anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative effects, suggesting that VC could inhibit the differentiation of osteoclast in vivo through its anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative pathways. However, VC had less significant effect on osteoclast number than Mg and had no effect on bone marrow fat area fraction, blood perfusion in red bone marrow region and blood leakage in yellow bone marrow region, while Mg showed significant effects. Our in vitro results showed that VC was essential for osteoblast differentiation, which was consistent with previous study [23]. VC deficiency could induce osteoporosis and higher VC intake leaded to higher BMD [23]. Our micro-CT results demonstrated that after VC supplementation for 6 weeks, the BMD and trabecular architecture were significant better than that of the SAON controls, while Mg supplementation could only increase BMD without improving trabecular architecture, suggesting that VC might improve the repair of SAON better than Mg alone at bone quality level. However, Mg ions had more significant effect on regulating metabolism, such as decreasing osteoclast differentiation and bone marrow fat, improving marrow blood perfusion and decreasing vessel leakage found in the present study, which could be explained as the main causes of destructive repair in SAON [82]. SAON is a disordered metabolism disease that involves disorder of different tissues\u2019 regulation, such as bone, fat and blood vessel, so combination of Mg and VC exerted the best on attenuate SAON that would suggest the ideal application potential for Mg-based implants to treat SAON in hip-preserving surgery.",

Our study current shows that Mg is more efficient in inhibiting osteoclast differentiation. As we designed, VC works quite well in promoting new bone formation, and there is no necrotic bone at week 6, which also suggests higher bone turnover rate in VC treated groups, while suppression of bone turnover is a therapy strategy to prevent collapse in SAON [85]. The highly mineralized necrotic bone could also maintain mechanical properties in favor of preventing collapse, so the persist presence of necrotic lesions in Mg supplemented groups at week 6 due to the inhibited bone resorption suggests that Mg is not a factor associated with increase of bone turnover. In terms of combined use of Mg (for the inhibiting bone resorption effect) and VC (for the promoting bone formation effect) promote the repair of SAON, the result could be regarded as the additive effect of Mg and VC. For regulating the disordered metabolism to attenuate SAON, our study suggests that Mg has anti-inflammation effect and VC has anti-oxidative effect underlying the effective SAON prevention. Experimental evidence of others showed that inflammation and oxidative stress could reinforce each other [86,87]. As anti-inflammatory treatment and anti-oxidative treatment have synergistic effects [88], we conclude that there is synergistic interaction between VC (anti-oxidative) and Mg (anti-inflammation).",

In the mechanism study NMDG (N-methyl-d-glucamine) chloride is used as chloride control to show that Mg ions but not chloride have anti inflammation effect through inhibiting calcium influx. Study of others using both MgCl2 and MgSO4 showed that there was no different effect between the two kinds of Mg ions on osteoblast [89]. Other in vivo studies also showed that both MgCl2 [90] and MgSO4 [91] have the same anti-osteoarthritic effect. The special situation for different Mg sources is brain Mg that the Mg supplementation should go through blood-brain barrier to brain. Magnesium-l-threonate (MgT) is a better Mg source to elevate brain Mg [92]. For our current study Mg ions could directly reach bone cells from serum, so we focus on the Mg ions\u2019 effect and mechanism although it would be more precise to compare two different Mg ions.",

LPS induced inflammation (mimic inflammatory diseases) decreases bone formation and increases apoptosis and bone resorption; and increases vessel permeability and leakage. Both bone event (bone matrix degeneration) and vessel event (ischemia) induce SAON. CS also induces oxidative stress, which will promote cell death to induce SAON. There is a mutual activation loop among anti-anabolic, inflammation and oxidative stress [74]. CS treatment could induce lower Mg. Mg supplementation increases the serum Mg level to normal level. Mg has anti-inflammatory effect and anabolic effect (e.g. through IGF-1 pathway). VC is an antioxidant and could induce osteogenesis.

Clinical trial using Mg screw to treat patients with osteonecrosis at femoral head (ONFH) showed that Mg screw improved the fixation of vascularized bone graft at femoral head in ONFH patients. The healing quality was not only assessed by Harris Hip Score (HHS), but also quantitatively evaluated by the displacement of the bone flap. Besides, BMD was found higher around Mg screw and at the fusion region of bone graft with local bone compared to control [5]. Our study supported that besides the mechanical fixation, Mg ions release from Mg crew had its bioactive function for improving of the repair of osteonecrotic lesions. The Mg ion releasing from the biodegradable materials can facilitate the benefit effect to attenuate the side-effect of CS in SAON patients. It is highly encouraged to develop biomaterials releasing Mg and VC that can annulate SAON and promote the repair of SAON in future study. Femoral neck fracture is one of the causes of trauma induced femoral head necrosis due to fracture nonunion [94]. Since Mg could improve bone fracture healing [95], Mg-based internal fixation implant with its degradation and Mg ions release for femoral neck fracture repair has great potential to increase the cortical bone formation in fracture repair enhancement as well as to prevent avascular necrosis suggested by the findings demonstrated by the current experimental study.",
