            "text": "The immune system of newborns is not fully developed. In humans and rodents IgG is transferred through the placenta, whereas in ruminants the immunity (mainly IgG) is transferred with colostrum and milk. The bird's immune system consists mainly of primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Functionally, it may be divided into innate, nonspecific and adaptive, specific. The noncellular branch includes 3 immunoglobulin classes: IgA, IgM, and IgY. The IgA and IgM are similar in molecular weight, structure, and electrophoretic mobility to their mammalian counterparts. The major avian immunoglobulin class IgY present in the serum and egg yolk shows fundamental structural differences in comparison with IgG molecule (e.g., higher molecular weight than that of mammalian IgG, the presence of an additional CH domain and 2 carbohydrate side-chains, a lower content of \u03b2-sheet structure, and more disordered structure compared with mammalian IgG). It also differs in proteolysis, temperature, pressure, and freezing stability (Chalghoumi et al., 2009). The IgY binds neither to proteins A and G, nor to the mammalian complement, and does not cross-react with mammalian immunoglobulins (Jensenius et al., 1981; Larsson et al., 1991).",

            "text": "In mammals, the transfer of maternal antibodies can take place after birth. However, in the chicken, the maternal antibodies must be transferred to the developing embryo to give acquired immunity to the chick. The IgA and IgM are incorporated into the egg white during egg formation (Rose and Orlans, 1981; Warr et al., 1995; Aveskogh and Hellman, 1998). Serum IgY is selectively transferred to the yolk via a receptor on the surface of the yolk membrane that is specific for IgY translocation. Hen's eggs are very convenient tool for antibody production. The serum concentration of IgY have been reported to be 5.0 mg/mL. Antigenic stimulation can yield more than 100 mg of IgY from one egg. A laying hen produces approximately 20 eggs per month; therefore, more than 2 g of IgY per month can be obtained from a hen. Hyperimmune or immune eggs are laid by hens that have typically been stimulated with inactivated microorganisms or purified antigens. Stimulation of the hens results in the formation of eggs containing high level of antibodies, predominantly the IgY class (Warr et al., 1995; Aveskogh and Hellman, 1998; Schade et al., 2005; Nilsson et al., 2007; Dias da Silva and Tambourgi, 2010). Passive immunization by oral administration of specific antibodies has been an attractive approach against gastrointestinal pathogens in both humans and animals. Immunoglobulin Y is an alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of various infections with antibiotic-resistant pathogens [e.g., Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Coronavirus, and Rotavirus (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002; Liou et al., 2011)].",

It was interesting to study if the IgY, the main chicken immunoglobulin, shows some immunoregulatory properties, similarly to ovine IgG2. For this reason, we compared the cytokine-inducing activity of a particular fraction obtained after isolation and purification of PRP from ovine colostrum: IgG2 containing PRP (named IgG+), PRP deprived IgG2 (named IgG\u2212) and isolated PRP with that of crude and additionally purified IgY fraction (IgY+ and IgY\u2212, respectively), and low molecular fraction after SEC (Y). The cytokine induction was determined in ex vivo stimulated human whole blood cell cultures. The use of unseparated whole blood cultures mimicked the natural microenvironment in which the different leukocyte populations can cooperate. This concept was validated by the use of LPS-stimulated cultures as positive controls. The LPS-treated controls revealed a statistically significant increase in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1-\u03b2 in all experiments.",

It is worth noting that the cytokine-inducing activity of IgG+ is higher than purified IgG (IgG\u2212; Figure 1\nb, Figure 2\nb). This confirms that immunoglobulin plays a role of a transporter of PRP, a biologically active substance important for the modulation of cellular signaling pathways. To find the presence of IgY-associated peptides with biological activities similar to PRP, we compared the cytokine inducing activity of IgY isolated from hen's eggs (IgY+), IgY purified using SEC chromatography (IgY\u2212), and IgY-associated peptides (Y) with the activities observed in PRP.",
