This article presents the rationale for potentially using old drugs (emetine, other ipecac alkaloids or analogues) that have been used to treat amoebiasis in the treatment of COVID-19. Emetine had amongst the lowest reported half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) from over 290 agents screened for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. While EC 50 concentrations of emetine are achievable in the blood, studies show that concentrations of emetine can be almost 300 times higher in the lungs. Furthermore, based on the relative EC 50 s of emetine towards the coronaviruses compared with Entamoeba histolytica, emetine could be much more effective as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis. This paper also discusses the known side effects of emetine and related compounds, how those side effects can be managed, and the optimal method of administration for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus poses, our long history with emetine and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm viral sensitivity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Emetine is one of the main alkaloids found in ipecacuanha (ipecac) root [1] .

Emetine, and perhaps ipecac, ipecac alkaloids and their analogues, should be considered as potentially potent and effective therapeutic agents against the coronavirus family of viruses and, in particular, the COVID-19 coronavirus. As an antiviral, emetine has been shown to have amongst the lowest EC 50 value (half-maximal effective concentration) from over 294 agents screened, with an EC 50 of 0.054 and 0.014 \u00b5M for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, respectively [2, 3] . Outlined here is the rationale for the potential use of emetine or similar compounds in the treatment of coronavirus infections and, if confirmed from in vitro sensitivity analyses, Emetine, as an isolated alkaloid, was used as an anti-infective agent from 1912 when Vedder [4] showed that the drug killed amoebae in vitro. It was one of the most widely used agents, orally or intramuscularly, in the treatment of both intestinal and extraintestinal amoebiasis [5] [6] [7] [8] until metronidazole became available [5] .

While the emetic effects of ipecac syrup (30 mL) can be completely eliminated and nausea significantly reduced by the use of 5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron [10] , which may enable higher blood levels to be achieved, these results might initially appear uninspiring. However, as coronaviruses are predominantly respiratory tract infections, the amount of emetine in the lungs is more important than in the plasma. Oral bioavailability studies of ipecac alkaloids in rats have shown that the concentration of radiolabeled emetine is many times higher in the tissues than in plasma. In relation to the lungs, after 8 and 24 h, the concentration of emetine in the lungs is~173 and~294 times higher than in plasma, respectively, with the maximum recorded amount present in the lungs at the 24-h time period. High concentrations were also found in many other tissues, such as the liver, heart, and small and large intestines [11] .

Some patients may not absorb sufficient emetine or alkaloids to be therapeutically effective. Intramuscular administration of emetine has a number of advantages over oral dosing. Emetine undergoes metabolism by the liver [15] . Intramuscular administration would prevent any liver metabolism during oral absorption (the \"first-pass effect\"). Radiolabeled emetine given parenterally, as with oral administration, accumulates in the lung [16] . In fact, another advantage of intramuscular over oral administration could be its greater uptake by the lungs. With radiolabeled emetine given by the oral route in rats, there was, at most time points, significantly (0.8-5.8 times) more emetine found in the liver than there was in the lungs [11] . Conversely, with radiolabeled emetine given by the intraperitoneal route in guinea pigs, the situation was reversed; at each time point, there was over twice as much emetine in the lungs than the liver [16] . It could initially be argued that this reflects interspecies variation. The more likely explanation is that with drugs absorbed into the intestinal circulation following oral administration, the first organ the circulation goes to is the liver, in order that foreign compounds can be detoxified. This results in a higher initial deposition in the liver, with the proportion in the liver decreasing throughout the day as it redistributes into the systemic circulation. With parenteral administration, once a drug enters the circulatory system, the first organ after leaving the heart is the lungs, resulting in higher concentrations to potentially counteract the COVID-19 virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 101, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 325, "end": 329, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 540, "end": 544, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 839, "end": 843, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1052, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Intramuscular administration of emetine can also result in nausea and vomiting [12] which, based on studies with ipecac syrup [10] , are likely to be negated with the concomitant use of a 5-HT3 antagonist.

Emetine, given intramuscularly, has been established over a long period as the most specific and highly potent agent against intestinal and extra-intestinal amoebiasis [18] . The IC 50 of emetine against Entamoeba histolytica is 26.8 \u00b5M [19] ; this is approximately 500-1900 times higher than the EC 50 for the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, implying that emetine is potentially far more potent as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis. These results may cast doubt on the very low EC 50 obtained with the SARS and MERS coronaviruses; however, studies by different authors have shown that emetine also has potent antiviral activity against the Zika virus (IC 50 = 0.00874 \u00b5M) [13] and the human cytomegalovirus (EC 50 = 0.04 \u00b5M) [20] . Interestingly, emetine also demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of Ebola virus viral-like particle entry into HeLa cells (IC 50 = 10.2 \u00b5M) [13] . At 0.03 \u00b5M, emetine was able to reduce HIV (wild type and multi-drug resistant M184V) infection by up to 80% in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [21] . HIV reverse transcriptase was also reduced by approximately 50% at an emetine concentration of 10 \u00b5M [21] . In relation to the coronaviruses, emetine activity against four strains of coronavirus had EC 50 values ranging from 0.12 to 1.43 \u00b5M, with the MERS coronavirus EC 50 being 0.34 \u00b5M [22] . While this EC 50 for the MERS virus is higher than in previous studies [3] , it does indicate that emetine is highly active against multiple coronaviruses. It has also been demonstrated that emetine can reduce viral entry into DPP4-expressing Huh-7.5 cells by a factor of 50-fold compared with that of the control, with an EC 50 value of 0.16 \u00b5M [22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 262, "end": 266, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 331, "end": 335, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 786, "end": 790, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 839, "end": 843, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 990, "end": 994, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1155, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1263, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1450, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1527, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1799, "end": 1803, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The main therapeutic issue with emetine use is perhaps its potential for cardiac toxicity. This was especially prevalent in India, where it was estimated that 10%-40% of the population had suffered from amoebiasis, resulting in the use of emetine being \"widespread and lavish\" [18] . Emetine use was associated with changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) -in particular, prolongation of the QT interval, elevation of the ST segment and inversion of the T wave [18] . A review in 1980 of the cardiac toxicity found that at therapeutic doses (1 mg/kg intramuscularly, maximum 60 mg, per day for 10 days or less [5] ) non-permanent cardiovascular side effects occurred. This frequently included ECG changes and moderate hypotension [5] and occasionally tachycardia and precordial pain. These changes occurred during treatment or after completion of treatment and often lasted for a period of time. The patient usually recovered without any sustained change in cardiovascular function [5] . Similarly, chronic ingestion of ipecac syrup over many months by sufferers of bulimia nervosa has been associated with cardiac fractional shortening due to cardiomyopathy, but this has been known to revert to normal after the ipecac was ceased [23] .

For each drug, a mid-range achievable blood level was obtained from the literature. This blood level was, in part, arbitrary as blood levels are mostly determined by the dose, which can vary considerably based on the condition being treated; there is also limited availability of studies measuring blood concentrations in patients. The ratio of the blood concentration/IC 50 was used to initially rank a drug's potential clinical significance as an antiviral agent against coronaviruses. Drugs that had higher ratios were deemed to be more clinically important, as it signified that therapeutic antiviral concentrations were more likely to be achievable at normal dosing. This system, by itself, proved inadequate, especially in the case of emetine. First, blood levels varied between studies. One study reported the range [14] of levels achieved, while another recorded the mean [9] , with the midpoint of the range and the mean being very different. This initially indicated that emetine could be very useful, with a blood concentration/IC 50 ratio of approximately 8 (see Table 1 ). When a more realistic blood concentration using the mean was found, the ratio was less than 2. Second, the blood levels do not take into consideration the tissue distribution of the drug. Basic pharmacokinetic parameters of each drug, such as the volume of distribution as an indicator of tissue uptake, should have been used to identify drugs that could potentially exhibit favourable tissue distribution. However, the volume of distribution data alone is not sufficient to determine specific tissue accumulation. A high volume of distribution indicates that the drug is removed from the plasma and goes into the tissues, but which tissues? Lipophilic drugs, with a high volume of distribution, are of little use if the drug partitions solely into adipose tissue. Similarly, a high distribution into the bones, as for bisphosphonates [29] , would also be of little use in this scenario.
