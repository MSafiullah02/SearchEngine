The main mode of introduction of SARS to countries around the world was via travellers on airplanes (Wilder-Smith & Freedman 2003) .

In addition, Singapore introduced health declaration cards on 7 April to all incoming passengers from SARS-hit countries, and from 29 April onwards to those of all countries.

Six of the nine travelers imported SARS to Singapore (from Hong Kong and Beijing) and three had acquired SARS in Singapore and were returning to Singapore (from New York, east Malaysia and Indonesia). However, only three airplanes (with four passengers) had symptomatic cases of SARS on board, whereas the passengers of the other flights developed symptoms within the first 2 days after arrival in Singapore.

The passenger was a doctor who had treated the first admitted case of SARS in Singapore at a time when this new disease was not identified and no infection control measures were in place. At disembarkation, the passengers were briefed on symptoms of SARS and advised to seek prompt health care should they develop symptoms.

The low incidence of in-flight transmission of SARS is consistent with the findings from mathematical modelling in Hong Kong and Singapore that the SARS coronavirus is only moderately transmissible, and that superspreaders contribute to the epidemic (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Riley et al. 2003) . Although one of the initially imported cases was a superspreader (transmission to 21 household contacts and health care workers) (Hsu et al. 2003) at the time of her flight she only had mild prodromal symptoms without cough. It appears that transmission mainly occurs when people have respiratory symptoms. None of the other cases except for the Singaporean doctor (transmission to two household contacts) resulted in secondary transmission. It is highly likely that the risk of in-flight transmission would be enhanced with superspreaders on the plane.
