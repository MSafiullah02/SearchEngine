            "text": "Foodborne disease is a significant public health concern in both developed and developing countries. Although the disease is usually mild and self-limiting, due to the high number of individuals affected each year, foodborne disease exerts a substantial socioeconomic burden on the population and healthcare system. In the USA, foodborne disease causes about 47.8 million illnesses, 127839 hospitalizations, and 3037 deaths per year (Scallan, Griffin, Angulo, Tauxe, & Hoekstra, 2011). In Australia, foodborne gastroenteritis causes an estimated 5.4 million illnesses, 14700 hospitalizations, and 76 deaths each year (Hall et al., 2005). In England and Wales, foodborne gastroenteritis caused an estimated 2.4 million illnesses, 21138 hospitalizations, and 718 deaths in 1995 (Adak, Long, & O\u2019Brien, 2002). A study of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) in China estimated 209 million episodes of foodborne disease occurred in 2010\u20132011, and the relative incidence in China appears to be within the range of incidence reported in the above-mentioned countries (Chen et al., 2013). However, the method used to estimate the burden of foodborne disease in the United States, England and Wales and Australia was different from that in China. In the above-mentioned studies, pathogen-specific data were used to calculate the foodborne proportion of AGI. However, due to the lack of pathogen-specific data used to calculate the foodborne proportion of AGI, the Chinese study only used the foodborne proportions calculated by those studies to roughly estimate the foodborne disease in China.",

Only a small part of foodborne diseases, hospitalizations, and deaths happen as portion of identified outbreaks (Dewey-Mattia, Roberts, Vieira, & Fullerton, 2016). However, the outbreak report is essential for a better understanding of the epidemiology of foodborne diseases. Although the summary of the outbreaks cannot lead to a clear conclusion of the disease trend, by identifying the implicated food vehicles and contributing factors, the health administration could be encouraged to evaluate and adopt suitable measures to prevent and control outbreaks in the future. Knowledge of implicated food vehicles and contributing factors allows consumers to be educated on decreasing high-risk behaviors, thereby reducing the risk of being affected by foodborne diseases. Up to date outbreak data can help food safety regulatory authorities to identify problems in the existing food supply system. Several countries systematically review foodborne disease outbreaks (FBDOs) in order to develop strategies to reduce the disease burden (Dalton et al., 2004, Gould et al., 2013, Lindqvist et al., 2000, O\u2019Brien et al., 2002).",

During 2003\u20132008, the virus replaced the bacterial pathogens as the most common cause of the reported FBDOs in the USA. As the number of outbreaks of viral causes increase, the number of outbreaks of unknown etiology is proportionally reduced (Gould et al., 2013). During the same period, probably due to lack of molecular biological and immunological techniques by local health sectors, only one rotavirus outbreak was reported to China NFDSN. The percentage of outbreaks with unknown etiology was almost doubled during the period 2003\u20132008 (20%) compared with that of 1992\u20132001 (10%). In the present study, about 20% of these outbreaks had an incubation period of equal or greater than 15 h, suggesting that many were of viral causes (Olsen, MacKinnon, Goulding, Bean, & Slutsker, 2000). It is not enough to rely on routine culture of intestinal bacteria during the outbreak of foodborne disease, and it is necessary to promote the local health sectors to improve the diagnostic capacity for virus detection and enumeration.",

In the present study, of the outbreaks with a single known etiology, man-made chemical hazards accounted for 25% of outbreaks, 14% of cases and 55% of deaths. The number of outbreaks and mortality attributed to man-made chemicals is remarkable, and all of these outbreaks are acute poisonings. To guarantee the chemicals such as food additives, pesticides and veterinary drugs are safely used, the Chinese government needs to develop stricter regulations on food and agricultural products, and to improve the administrative law enforcement mechanism.",
