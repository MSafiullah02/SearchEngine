Therefore, control of such unpredictable systems caught attention of researcher since 1990s. Runzi Luo [16] investigated control of unpredictable behavior zhang hyperchaotic system with model uncertainties, external noise and anonymous parameters. In 2019, Omid Mofid et. al [17] used fractional-order chaotic system and controlled its chaos using adaptive controller with the help of Lyapunov stability theory. The problem of controlling three dimensional perturbed chaotic system with partially known dynamics in the existence of sensor noise is done by Aghababa [18]. A control input based on adaptive sliding technique is applied on magnet synchronous motor oscillator [19], where nonlinear terms and upper bound of mentioned dynamical system are taken as anonymous in whole process. In 2018, Luo et. al [20] considered fractional-order chaotic brushless DC motor system and used finite-time echo state controller to compensate uncertainties therein. An active control based strategy is designed in [21] for two identical discrete chaotic systems. Based on error dynamics and sequential control procedure, three controllers [22] are designed for Rucklidge chaotic system for the purpose of analysis whereas, oscillatory dynamics of a chaotic system including forcing forcing term [23] is studied and controlled for particular value of t. Recently, in 2020 an optimal controller based on sequential, parameter uncertainties is derived [24] for electromechanical system. Peng et. al proposed (ANIC) control strategy for robotic system along with consideration of external disturbance.",

Dongmo et. al [29] worked on different type of synchronization using active backstepping input for hyperchaotic systems. In 2015, two non-identical integer and fractional order chaotic systems are considered for synchronization [30] using sliding mode controller.

A leader-follower based algorithm is proposed by Huang [33] in 2019 for designing observer for quadrotor using consensus static controller. Zhao et. al [34] worked on incremental quadratic constraints for observer based secure communication scheme whereas, amendment in increment multiplier matrix is carried out by Zhang et. al [35]. An adaptive observer [36], satisfying Lipschitz inequality, based on state estimation is derived using linear matrix inequalities. Apart from continuous time chaotic systems, Zhang et. al [37] worked on discrete-time systems and introduced generalized Luenberger like observer. In 2020, Kaviarasan [38] used fuzzy modelling approach for robust observer based control of multi-weighted complex network systems. Moreover, multiple sensors are used in work of Wen [39] for transmission of data between heterogeneous nonlinear systems. Zhang et. al considered exponential reduced order observer [40] for chaotic systems satisfying incremental quadratic restrictions and its improved version of exponential reduced observer is given in [41]. The issue of transferring data in noise based public Chanel is observed in [42], while problem of unmatched observer is solved in [43] by Yang.",

First of all, a state observer is derived for class of chaotic systems satisfying incremental quadratic constraints which is verified with example based on secure communication given in Section 5. It is concluded from corollaries 3.6 and 3.7 that observer (17) we derived is generalized form of observers designed in [34], [35]. Furthermore, with the aid of LTspice, a circuit is designed for quadrotor chaotic system which we used in path tracking of robot. After performing several simulations on considered chaotic system, we concluded from Figs. 19 and 20 that second simulation show better results in bounded rectangular region. In future, our target is to design an observer for hyperchaotic systems and will try to implement on RBG images, while in robotics our aim is to implement such targets on real based models which might be helpful in worst conditions such as CoV\u221219.",
