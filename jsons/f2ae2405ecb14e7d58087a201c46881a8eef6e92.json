Additionally, investigation of pathogen-induced alterations in the host proteome under diseased conditions can provide valuable information regarding disease pathogenesis and host immune responses [8] . In order to sustain viability within the host system and ensure their replication, pathogens develop versatile mechanisms to exploit their host's cells and to induce new permeability pathways to allow the uptake of nutrients and the removal of waste products [9] . This significantly affects various vital physiological processes and, as a consequence, modulates the host's proteome. Upon infection, a continuous interaction between the pathogen and the host immune system initiates a complex immune response to hold back the pathogenic infection and growth through multiple antiparasitic effector functions, including inhibition of invasion and cytoadherence, antibodydependent cytotoxicity, and cellular inhibition.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 179, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 615, "end": 618, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 818, "end": 821, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1086, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Serum/plasma proteins can be used for early diagnosis, differentiation between infections with very similar etiology and clinical manifestations, as well as for monitoring disease progression, since many components of the blood proteome often exhibit alterations in expression level as a consequence of external pathogenic infections and show excellent correlation with disease progression/severity [10, 11] . Large numbers of serum/plasma proteomics studies aimed at the identification of novel potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers or understanding disease pathobiology have been reported during the past decade [3] . However, altered expression levels of potential biomarkers have often been found to be nonspecific and are altered in multiple infectious diseases, irrespective of the type of infection. This might be an effect of inflammation-mediated acute phase response signaling [12] .

Moreover, we have compiled a list of differentially expressed serum proteins in ten different types of protozoan, viral, and bacterial infectious diseases that are often fatal, including malaria, dengue, meningitis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), diarrheas, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and leptospirosis, from over 200 published studies conducted using proteomics and immunoassay-based approaches.

Biomarkers are indicator biomolecules that assist in early diagnosis, discriminate between different diseases, and provide valuable tools for monitoring the progression/severity of disease. Early detection of infectious diseases could reduce the complications of secondary infections, fatalities due to disease severity, and also the unnecessary costs of improper and delayed diagnosis and treatment. Although existing diagnostic approaches (including analysis of clinical symptoms, microscopic detection of the causative pathogenic organism, molecular and immunologic diagnostic methods, and rapid diagnostic tests), which are usually implemented clinically, are adequately robust and sensitive for detection of the pathogen in symptomatic patients, the sensitivity is lower in asymptomatic subjects or in patients at a very early stage of infection (Table 1) . Furthermore, existing routine detection techniques are unable to provide any prognostic information regarding the infection, or to clearly discriminate among infections that have overlapping clinical manifestations. To this end, protein markers are potential candidates for the development of alternative more-sensitive diagnostic and prognostic approaches for infectious diseases. Identification of a panel of biomarkers might be attractive for detection of specific infections, as well as for discrimination among nearly similar identical manifestations. The use of serum or plasma as biological fluid for studying disease pathobiology and identification of biomarkers have their own pros and cons. Plasma is more easily separable from the cellular components of the blood and a slightly higher volume (10-15%) of plasma is generally obtained from an equal quantity of whole blood compared to serum. Furthermore, a plasma sample can be obtained quickly since no coagulation time is required and coagulation-induced interferences/variations can be avoided. In contrast, due to the absence of fibrinogen and other blood clotting factors in serum, the total protein content and complexity is reduced compared to plasma. According to a recent study by Zimmerman et al. involving paired comparison of plasma and serum samples from the same individuals, there were negligible differences in the numbers of peptide and protein identifications or in the overall percentages of semitryptic peptides or methionine oxidized peptides between these two biological fluids, although higher variability of semitryptic peptides were observed in serum [17] . In particular, the variations in serum samples are introduced due to the inconsistency in the coagulation and separation processes.

Experimental details (e.g., sample type, population size, type of controls, technologies employed in the discovery and validation phases of the study, and the important identified differentially expressed proteins) of many selected proteomics or immunoassay-based studies on these infectious diseases have been provided in Table 2 . Critical analysis of the published literature from various research groups clearly indicates that the expression levels of many reported potential biomarkers are modulated similarly in several infectious diseases, irrespective of the type of the pathogen, this might be a result of generic acute-phase/stress reactions, while the specifically modulated candidates in different pathogenic infections could be indicators of some unique responses. Differential expression profiles of a few selected serum proteins in different infectious diseases are shown in Fig. 2 . Serum/plasma proteins, which show opposite trends of differential expression in some infections compared to other types of infectious diseases, are promising candidates for diagnosis and discrimination analysis. Interestingly, serum levels of haptoglobin (Hp) were found to be significantly lower in malaria patients (both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection). Hp, being a positive acute phase protein, exhibits upregulation in other infectious diseases ( Fig. 2 ; Supporting Information Table 1). Hp sequesters free hemoglobin (Hb), which is released during pathogen-induced hemolysis as Hp-Hb complexes and leads to hypo-or ahaptoglobinemia. Hp is a promising inflammatory marker for evaluation of the severity of the Plasmodium infection and is a potential epidemiological marker for malaria [25, 26] . Additionally, our comparative analysis of various infectious diseases indicates that even though some proteins, such as SAA or CRP, exhibit similar trends of differential expression (upregulation) in multiple infections, the levels of regulation (fold changes) are found to be quite different depending on the type of infectious agent, so these candidates could be effective classifiers for discriminating among different infectious manifestations (Fig. 2) . It has been shown that establishment of a panel of serum biomarkers rather than a single candidate is much more effective for detection of specific infection and its discrimination from the other clinically related febrile illnesses [13] . In our proteomic analyses, we have found that a panel of identified proteins consisting of six candidates (serum amyloid A, hemopexin, apolipoprotein E, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein, and apolipoprotein A-I) can discriminate among malaria, dengue, and leptospirosis [13, 15, 16] . Although these six proteins were not unique for malaria, dengue, or leptospirosis, the combination of their specific trends and levels of differential expression allowed the successful discrimination among these three infectious diseases having overlapping clinical manifestations. Within a panel, if the individual class prediction potential of the candidate markers is evaluated, it becomes apparent that each of them plays some specific contribution in discrimination of a particular infection from the healthy population and other related clinical manifestations. Therefore, we feel that the combination of clinicopathological parameters with serum/plasma markers can provide improved prediction accuracy for most diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2062, "end": 2066, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2067, "end": 2070, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2765, "end": 2769, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3045, "end": 3049, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3050, "end": 3053, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3054, "end": 3057, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 674, "end": 681, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1247, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1729, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2521, "end": 2529, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": ") Pathogen culturing approach (3) Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) (4) Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and ELISA"}, {"text": "Many serum/plasma proteins, such as \u2423-1-antichymotrypsin, \u2423-1-antitrypsin, serotransferrin, serum albumin, \u2423-2-HS-glycoprotein, etc., which exhibit similar trends of differential expression in multiple infections, are basically nonspecific indicators of inflammation or stress response, and are not promising from a diagnostic/prognostic point of view (Fig. 2) . Very often, in isolated proteomics studies, where only disease versus healthy controls are compared, differentially expressed candidates are found, but many are simply a consequence of generic acute phase reactions, which are misclaimed as promising markers (Fig. 3A) . In real-life scenarios, biomarker candidates that are commonly altered in multiple infectious diseases cannot effectively discriminate between different clinical manifestations, unless the levels of differential expression of these candidate proteins are significantly different in other infections, or if they are used as part of a marker panel along with other more specific candidates. Other reviews have demonstrated the frequent appearance of HSP27, HSP60, ATP synthase, \u2424-actin, and enolase 1 as differentially expressed candidates in various published tissue proteomics analyses performed by using 2DE in combination with MS [12, 27] .

Usually, about one tenth of these are confirmed in the validation/follow-up phase, where targeted analysis is performed with bigger clinical cohorts using alternative technological approaches. Gradually, the number decreases even further during the clinical trials, and ultimately, only a few identified markers are found to have real clinical applicability and receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (Fig. 5) . It should be pointed out that very few biomarkers or biomarker panels have actually been through the verification or validation stages. This is because the techniques used for biomarker discovery are generally not suitable for validation purpose. Antibody-based methods, such as immunoassay-based validation (Western blots and ELISA) are too expensive to be used on the huge number of potential candidates identified in the discovery phase and cannot be highly multiplexed [37] . To this end, MS-based targeted proteomic approaches, particularly, SRM (or MRM) are coming to the fore as alternative validation methods [38] .

A recent study by Zhao et al. has shown the influences of preanalytical variations of blood sampling and handling on the findings of quantitative immunoassays for rheumatoid arthritis [43] . Findings obtained from this study indicate that while the effect of blood sample collection, processing, and handling processes is minimal on autoantibody biomarker measurements, these variables can substantially affect serum protein concentrations. Yi et al. have demonstrated the time-dependent al-terations in human plasma and serum proteins due to the proteolytic degradation by intrinsic plasma peptidases and proteases, and recommended the addition of protease inhibitors instantaneously with the blood samples during collection process to increase stabilization of the plasma proteins and prevent proteolysis-related preanalytical variability [44] . Repeated freeze-thawing cycles also affect the serum/plasma protein stability and reproducibility of the obtained results, and should be avoided. Taken as a whole, the use of optimized blood collection devices, reduction of the time elapsed between blood collection and subsequent processing, control of the sample handling procedure and environment, stable storage temperature, and avoidance of multiple freeze/thaw cycles can cumulatively reduce the sample instability and preanalytical variations associated with serum/plasma proteomics biomarker studies [45] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 301, "end": 305, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 653, "end": 657, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1020, "text": "Zhao et al. has", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1175, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1832, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2393, "end": 2397, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 976, "end": 984, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Effects of preanalytical variables"}, {"text": "Another vital issue is the determination of population size (diseased and control) during the discovery and validation phases of biomarker discovery [46] (Fig. 5) .

Nevertheless, the analysis cost and the availability of suitable clinical samples often constrain the investigation of bigger clinical cohorts. Prior to the comparative proteomic analysis, power calculations should be performed to estimate the minimum number of biological replicates required from diseased and control populations. In a recent study, Gandhi et al. have shown through power calculation analysis that the DIGE experiment requires at least ten samples from each group to be confident of 1.5-fold difference at the p < 0.05 significance level [47] . However, the minimum sample size depends on the type of analysis, study population, and reproducibility of the experimental approaches implicated. It is generally advised to perform validation studies employing larger clinical cohorts than the sample size used in discovery phase [37] . All in all, the design of appropriate proteomics experiments involving different types of febrile subjects as diseases controls, and validation of the initial findings in larger clinical cohorts using alternative technological approaches, is essential for obtaining conclusive protein markers for any specific infection that can subsequently be translated into real clinical applications.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 153, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 817, "end": 821, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1108, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 162, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "Determination of sample size"}, {"text": "Another controversial issue for clinical proteomic profiling experiments is the analysis of pooled samples. Certainly, information obtained from analysis of individual samples is much more reliable than the analysis of pooled samples, since pooling of samples may not effectively reflect the real biological alterations. Moreover, actual differences might be masked due to the presence of some outliers with extreme biological variability within the pooled cohorts. Nevertheless, pooling of clinical samples is often practiced in quantitative proteomics analysis, particularly when larger numbers of samples need to be studied or there is not an adequate amount of each sample for individual analysis. In proteomic investigations using pooled samples, it is more acceptable if multiple small pools of control and diseased samples are analyzed, rather than preparation of a single pooled set containing all the samples to be analyzed.

Longitudinal studies of infectious diseases, which involve repeated observations of the same subjects over long periods of time (early febrile, defervescence, and convalescent stages of infection), can provide additional valuable information regarding changes in the identified disease markers and their utility as disease monitoring or prognostic markers (Fig. 3B) . To this end, a serum proteome and cytokine analysis in longitudinal cohorts of dengue fever and its life-threatening complication dengue hemorrhagic fever has recently been reported by Kumar et al. [48] . The authors have shown that an in-depth investigation of serum proteome signatures at different time-points during the infection and their correlation analysis with clinicopathological parameters can help to unravel mechanisms of dengue disease progression.

Comparison and extrapolation of data generated in different research laboratories are possible only when uniform standards for proteomics procedures with negligible preanalytical and technological variations are practiced globally. To this end, in 2002, the HUPO PSI (http://psidev.sourceforge.net/) was established to develop universal reference standards for use in proteomics studies. These standard methods can be followed to introduce uniformity and reproducibility in data acquisition and analysis processes, which in turn can accelerate comparison, exchange, and interpretation of data [63, 64] , and avoid the \"fragmentation of proteomics data\" generated in different research laboratories across the globe [65] . The HUPO PSI committee is working on the development of standard operating procedures and quality assurance protocols for data handling and analysis at a global scale. Moreover, HUPO PSI's goal is to develop reporting requirements, data exchange formats, and controlled vocabularies to formalize the requirements of the proteomics community and to encourage participation in multidisciplinary collaborative projects, such as the Functional Genomics Experiment (FuGE) and Functional Genomics Investigation Ontology (FuGO), in order to accelerate the collation, comparison, and analysis of \"multiomics\" datasets [66] . HUPO PSI's specified standards have already been successfully implemented in the field of MS and molecular interactions, including TraML format for exchange of SRM transition lists [67] , mzIdentML data standard for MS-based proteomics results [68] , PSICQUIC and PSIS-CORE for accessing and scoring molecular interactions [69] , and the International Molecular Exchange (IMEx) consortium for protein interaction data curation [70] .

High-throughput proteomic technologies suitable for the rapid screening and quantification of thousands of analytes with high accuracy are needed for the finding of authentic biomarkers. Ultimately, the primary objective of proteomics biomarker discovery research is to establish novel candidate markers that can be clinically useful, as well as to translate the existing findings into practical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. However, in spite of having tremendous potential, actual bed-side translation of the findings obtained from proteomic research has thus far been limited. The efforts of the proteomics community have started to show results, as is evident from success stories, such as the OVA1 test, which has obtained FDA clearance [73] .
