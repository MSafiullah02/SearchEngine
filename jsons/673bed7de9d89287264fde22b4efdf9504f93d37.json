However, the majority of published studies have been conducted in the ICU setting or only in mechanically ventilated patients. ICUs are usually well delimited areas with a relatively small number of patients who are not usually exposed to aerosols (showers, hot tap water). That is why LD has rarely been detected in ICUs with the only exception of those cases associated with the use of contaminated water in nasogastric tubes or mechanical ventilation equipment [11] .",

Environmental studies have demonstrated that colonization of the potable water distribution is a common feature in many hospitals [76] . When the water supply of a hospital is known to be colonized by Legionella, the index of suspicion of infection by Legionella rises and appropriate testing is then systematically ordered. Consequently, sporadic cases of LD and nosocomial outbreaks are then more frequently reported and even historical cases, previously unrecognized, are retrospectively identified. [44, 47] . Everts et al. reported a series of HAP in which Legionella was the most frequent cause of nosocomial pneumonia [22] . In a multicenter study performed in 12 Spanish University hospitals, with active surveillance of HAP in non-ventilated patients and systematic use of LUA test, L. pneumophila was diagnosed in seven patients in five different hospitals not in an outbreak setting [78] . In one hospital, it was the first case of nosocomial legionellosis diagnosed in that center [85] . Diagnosis of Legionella should be considered in any case of HAP in a hospital with water distribution known to be colonized by these microorganisms [77] . the environmental source of almost all reported hospital outbreaks [77] . However, potable water should not be neglected as a potential source of infection both in sporadic cases and small clusters detected in the community [62] . Moreover, cases of LD in newborns, most likely caused by aspiration of bath water, have also been reported [80] .",

However, aspiration of contaminated water could also be a major mode of transmission, especially in hospital-acquired legionellosis [77] . In a prospective study of patients with head and neck cancer undergoing tumor resection with postoperative sequelae of aspiration, 30 % of postoperative pneumonias were due to L. pneumophila [39] . Surprisingly, several studies have failed to show a link between showering and risk of infection [23, 26, 44, 81] . Others have even reported that showering could be protective for legionnaires' disease [7] . The presumed reason for this paradoxical finding is that patients who are able to take showers are ambulatory and less likely to aspirate [77] . Nasogastric tubes [52, 90] have been linked to hospitalacquired legionellosis in several studies; the authors presumed that microaspiration of contaminated water was the cause of infection.",

Smoking habit is, by far, the most consistently reported risk factor in most series. Underlying diseases are a major risk factor for the acquisition of Legionella pneumonia, especially in the hospital setting. Since aspiration is increasingly recognized as a mode of transmission, patients with swallowing disorders or those who undergo surgery requiring general anesthesia are at greater risk. The single most important factor is organ transplant. Among organ receptors heart transplants show the highest incidence and bone marrow transplants the lowest one [54, 68] . Steroid administration is an independent risk factor [44, 47] . Other forms of immunocompromise may also predispose to LD [48] . Paradoxically, AIDS patients do not appear to be at increased risk for hospital-acquired legionnaires' disease [63] .",

Initial retrospective series suggested that clinical findings such as diarrhea or central nervous system symptoms were so frequent in legionellosis that they could be considered as highly suggestive of LD [41] . Later studies have already emphasized the lack of usefulness of those allegedly distinctive clinical data [25, 70] . Prospective, randomized, comparative studies between CAP and HAP caused by Legionella and those caused by other bacterial etiologies have shown that there is a marked overlap between clinical, radiological and analytical signs [35, 51, 70, 92, 93] . Serum levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and neopterin, are often high in LD [1, 28, 65] . However, the clinical or therapeutic implications of this analytical finding remain obscure. The uncertainty in clinical differential diagnosis of CAP and HAP, as well as the potential severity of LD, supports the choice of an antibiotic that is also effective against Legionella in the initial therapeutic approach of most instances of hospitalized CAP and at least in suspicious epidemiological situations in the case of HAP.",

To optimize the recovery of Legionella some authors recommend the use of two more media: BCYE media, PAV and BCYE supplemented with polymyxin, anisomycin, cefamandole and dyes (PAC) [87] . The addition of dyes facilitates the visualization of the colonies, making identification of L. micdadei and L. maceachernii easier. Pretreatment of sputum with acid is necessary to reduce the overgrowth of other bacteria. Vancomycin containing medium is pre-ferred when L. micdadei is an issue since cefamandole inhibits this species [57] . The quality of sputum does not necessarily correlate with recovery of Legionella. This microorganism has been recovered from so-called inadequate specimens for culture (few polymorphonuclear leukocytes and numerous epithelial cells). Culture of respiratory samples continues to be the most valid diagnostic method and should be mandatory in all centers. The isolation of Legionella allows its microbiologic classification and subtyping by DNA studies. Molecular typing is crucial to establish an epidemiological link between environmental and clinical isolates.",

The recommended optimal dosing of 1 g IV a Oral therapy is recommended only in those mild cases that do not require hospitalization. Some antibiotics are only commercially available in selected countries b In mild cases other oral macrolides are also effective: josamycin (1 g every 12 h), roxithromycin (150 mg every 12 h), dirithromycin (500 mg every 24 h) c Less active than other macrolides; risk of fluid overload, phlebitis and transitory deafness with IV administration d Recommended in the more severe cases, particularly in the immunocompromised e Because of short accumulated clinical experience their use is recommended only in mild to moderate cases every 6 h is associated with some side effects [72] , such as risk of fluid overload and transitory deafness. Other more recent macrolides share with erythromycin the ability to penetrate phagocytic cells with the advantage of showing an overall better intrinsic activity against Legionella. Besides this superior in vitro activity against Legionella, they offer pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages. Relatively minor differences in the in vitro activity among the new macrolides have also been found in different comparative studies [3] . Consequently, the treatment of choice has changed from erythromycin to the newer macrolides and fluoroquinolones (Table 37.1) . Recent studies [9, 59, 79] , which unfortunately show many limitations because of methodological drawbacks [46] , suggest that in terms of mortality and complications both macrolides and fluoroquinolones are equivalent for most cases of LD that require hospitalization.
