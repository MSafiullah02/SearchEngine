Despite intense research 28 effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable 29 uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, 30 Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been 31 reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12 nd 2019. Epidemiological 32 investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested 33 that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven 34 patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 35 (BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, 36 dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 37 26 th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing 4 identified a novel RNA virus 38 from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV). 39 Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that 40 WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of 41 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, 42 subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history 43 of genomic recombination. This outbreak highlights the ongoing capacity of viral spill-44 over from animals to cause severe disease in humans. 45 46",

Notably, in addition to 61 fish and shell fish, a variety of live wild animals including hedgehogs, badgers, snakes, and 62 birds (turtledoves) were available for sale in the market before the outbreak began, as well as 63 animal carcasses and animal meat. No bats were available for sale. While the patients might 64 have had contact with wild animals in the market, none recalled exposure to live poultry. 65 Patient 1 was a 41-year-old man with no history of hepatitis, tuberculosis or diabetes. 66 He was admitted and hospitalized in Wuhan Central Hospital 6 days after the onset of illness. 67 The patient reported fever, chest tightness, unproductive cough, pain and weakness for one 68 week on presentation. Physical examination of cardiovascular, abdominal and neurologic 69 examination was normal. Mild lymphopenia (less than 900 cells per cubic milli-meter) was 70 5 observed, but white blood cell and blood platelet count was normal in a complete blood count 71 (CBC) test. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP, 41.4 mg/L of blood, reference range 72 0-6 mg/L) was observed and levels of aspartate aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, and 73 creatine kinase were slightly elevated in blood chemistry tests. The patient had mild 74 hypoxemia with oxygen levels of 67mmHg by the Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test. On the 75 first day of admission (day 6 after the onset of illness), chest radiographs were abnormal with a meta-transcriptomic library was constructed for pair-end (150 bp) sequencing using an 93 Illumina MiniSeq as previously described [4] [5] [6] [7] (Table S1 and S2). The genome sequence of this novel virus, as well as its termini, were 99 determined and confirmed by RT-PCR 9 and 5'/3' RACE kits (TaKaRa), respectively. This 100 new virus was designated as WH-Human 1 coronavirus (WHCV) (and has also been referred 101 to as '2019-nCoV') and its whole genome sequence (29,903 nt) has been assigned GenBank 102 accession number MN908947. Remapping the RNA-seq data against the complete genome of 103 WHCV resulted in an assembly of 123,613 reads, providing 99.99% genome coverage at a 104 mean depth of 6.04X (range: 0.01X -78.84X) ( Figure S2 ). The viral load in the BALF sample 105 was estimated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) to be 3.95\u00d710 8 copies/mL ( Figure S3 ).",

Four other coronaviruses -human 178 coronaviruses HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E -are also associated with respiratory disease 19-179 22 . Although SARS-like coronaviruses have been widely identified in mammals including bats 180 10 since 2005 in China 9,23-25 , the exact origin of human-infected coronaviruses remains unclear. 181 Herein, we describe a novel coronavirus -WHCV -in BALF from a patient experiencing 182 severe respiratory disease in Wuhan, China. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that WHCV 183 represents a novel virus within genus Betacoronavirus (subgenus Sarbecovirus) and hence 184 that exhibits some genomic and phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV 1 , particularly in the 185 RBD. These genomic and clinical similarities to SARS, as well as its high abundance in 186 clinical samples, provides evidence for an association between WHCV and the ongoing 187 outbreak of respiratory disease in Wuhan. 188 The identification of multiple SARS-like-CoVs in bats led to the idea that these animals 189 act as the natural reservoir hosts of these viruses 19,20 . Although SARS-like viruses have been 190 identified widely in bats in China, viruses identical to SARS-CoV have not yet been 191 documented. Notably, WHCV is most closely related to bat coronaviruses, even exhibiting 192 100% aa similarity to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 in the nsp7 and E proteins. Hence, these data suggest 193 that bats are a possible reservoir host of WHCV. However, as a variety of animal species were 194 for sale in the market when the disease was first reported, more work is needed to determine 195 the natural reservoir and any intermediate hosts of WHCV. 196 197 Acknowledgements This study was supported by the Special National Project on 198 investigation of basic resources of China (Grant SQ2019FY010009) and the National Natural 199 Science Foundation of China (Grants 81861138003 and 31930001).
