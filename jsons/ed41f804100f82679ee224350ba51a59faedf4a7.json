The sequence was deposited in the GenBank database (accession number MN908947) and uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).

In the past twenty years, two previous coronavirus epidemics have occurred, the first started in 2003 and became known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV. SARS-CoV was first recognised in China. The outbreak involved twenty-four countries with over 8,000 cases and 800 deaths. The second was first reported in 2012 and became known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV. MERS-CoV began in Saudi Arabia with over 2,500 cases and 800 deaths. . The report recorded that 70,524 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed in the UK during the preceding two weeks. This equated to a 14-day incidence of 106 cases per 100,000 population. However, the severity of symptoms from COVID-19 infection varies greatly and the number of UK citizens being tested for the virus only exceed 10,000 per day on the 11 April. In consequence, the recorded incidence is likely to be an underestimate.",

The gender and mortality ratios were reversed and the mean age of the COVID-19 patients was a decade higher (69.32 against 59.9 years). The mortality rate of the COVID-19 patients was approximately 2.5 times higher (32.6% against 12.27%) and the mean duration of their admissions was three days longer than the 2019 cohort. In these respects, the COVID-19 infection is proving to be a more challenging medical problem, particularly for elderly men.",

Nevertheless, the ESTH data is consistent with national outcomes and if the outcome for patients requiring prolonged ventilation does not prove any more successful than seen in the first 11 days, staff morale may be compromised and public support for the nation's investment in critical care for COVID-19 patients may be challenged.",
