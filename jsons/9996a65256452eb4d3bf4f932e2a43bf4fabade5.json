The focus of this book is on climate change, but other hazards help to better illustrate and understand EWS in the context of climate change. These include hazards which manifest rapidly, such as tsunamis, as well as creeping hazards which manifest slowly, such as drought. The fundamental tenet is that each EWS needs to be viewed as a social process which often involves technical components embedded in their social context. That leads to a preference for a 'First Mile' approach for designing EWS, which involves communities from the beginning of developing an EWS, rather than a 'Last Mile' approach, which adds people and communities towards the end of the design process. By keeping people and communities at the centre of an EWS from the beginning, the EWS can contribute to daily life and livelihoods, thereby supporting wider disaster risk reduction and sustainable development endeavours, rather than being a separate system waiting to be triggered only when a hazard appears. Yet any EWS has limitations. Those limitations need to be recognised and overcome through other approaches, with possibilities being to consider 'medium warning' and 'late warning' systems rather than just early warning.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "A universally accepted defi nition of an early warning system (EWS) does not exist and probably never will exist.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EWS in General"}, {"text": "The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR 2012 : online) defi nes an early warning system to be 'The set of capacities needed to generate and disseminate timely and meaningful warning information to enable individuals, communities and organizations threatened by a hazard to prepare and to act appropriately and in suffi cient time to reduce the possibility of harm or loss'.

The EWS will include adaptation to new hazard regimes, so that atoll communities are warned about potential changes to their freshwater supplies, coral reefs, and coastlines.

After a higher alert level was decided, the EWS forbade the alert level to drop lower until a mandatory waiting period had elapsed of 72 h (from Alert Level 3 to Alert Level 2) or 1 week (from Alert Level 4 to Alert Level 3) (Punongbayan et al. 1996 ; this alert level system has now been entirely revised).
