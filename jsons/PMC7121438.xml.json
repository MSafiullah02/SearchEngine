This interval of care in the PICU begins with brain death and consent to donation and culminates with surgical organ procurement. It generally ranges from 12 to 48 h or longer and is related to the time required for repeated brain death declarations, consent discussions with the family, procurement logistics of donor/organ evaluation, and donor/recipient matching. During this phase, risks for hemodynamic instability and compromise of end organ function are high (Table 38.1). There is a significant opportunity for enhancing donor multi-organ function and improving organ utilization with appropriate medical management [1].\n",

PICU care should be tailored by principles similar to the management of any patient with multifactorial shock. It is important to treat the donor as one would treat the transplant recipient.

Endogenous catecholamine-related increases in peripheral resistance may result in a sudden increase in myocardial work and oxygen consumption leading to myocardial ischemia or infarction and subsequent elevation of cardiac troponin I and T [15, 28]. Patients dying of acute intracranial events show scattered foci of transmural myocardial injury that are not seen in patients dying of noncerebral causes [29]. Myocardial necrosis after subarachnoid hemorrhage is a neurally mediated process that is dependent on the severity of neurological injury [30]. Brain dead cardiac donors with elevations in cardiac troponin I have been shown to have diffuse subendocardial myocytolysis and coagulative necrosis and a high incidence of graft failure after transplantation [31]. The magnitude of the rise of epinephrine after brain death and the extent of myocardial damage have also been shown to depend on the rate of rise in ICP in a canine model [12, 32]. Dogs given a sudden rise in ICP demonstrated a higher epinephrine surge and poorly functioning donor hearts. Surgical sympathectomy [33] or pharmacologic sympathetic blockade in humans [34] and animals [35, 36] effectively prevents the ICP-related catecholamine cardiotoxicity and the electrophysiologic, biochemical and pathologic changes characteristic of neurogenic injury in the heart. While the ICP-related sympathetic storm is characterized by myocardial injury and high systemic vascular resistance, it is soon followed by period of sympathetic depletion and a low SVR state. Brain dead patients become functionally decapitated and the sympathetic system is anatomically interrupted, similar to high spinal cord injuries [37].",

In primate models of acute intracranial hypertension, acute heart failure ensues with reversal of flow in the pulmonary circulation due to massive rises in left atrial pressure [33].

Transient focal cerebral ischemia upregulates the transcriptional levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and other markers [44, 45]. Rapid rises of ICP causes immune activation in peripheral organs resulting in enhanced immunogenicity [32]. In animal models, brain death has a detrimental effect on hepatic dysfunction related to immune activation and appears to be independent of hemodynamic instability [46] and magnified by longer ischemic times [47]. In comparison to living related kidney donors, kidneys from brain dead donors have significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory mediators on biopsy (endothelial E-selectin and proximal tubular expression of HLA-DR antigens, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) [48, 49]. Delayed renal graft function and acute rejection in the recipient is correlated to higher indices of free radical mediated injury in the donor [50, 51]. Evidence that neurogenic pulmonary edema may be alleviated with glucocorticoids also suggests that an inflammatory component exists in this process [52, 53]. Recent animal work suggests that this inflammation is triggered by the acute hemodynamic effects of ICP-related neurogenic myocardial dysfunction, resulting in hydrostatic pressure based neurogenic pulmonary edema and rupture of the alveolar-capillary membrane [39, 54].",

The variety of changes in volume status, cardiac inotropy, and peripheral vascular resistance that occur after brain death are similar to those in any pediatric critically ill patient with shock of diverse etiology. Intensivists should titrate cardiovascular therapy to clinical, biochemical and hemodynamic endpoints that ensure restoration of intravascular volume status, and appropriate support of the myocardium and vascular system to ensure optimal cardiac output for organ perfusion.

Evaluation of left ventricular end diastolic diameter, ventricular wall thickness, and coronary flow are felt to influence transplantation [63]. Single echocardiographic evaluations may have limitations in detecting the reversible myocardial dysfunction often seen after brain injury [26]. Recent studies advocate pharmacologic stress evaluation for organ suitability [64]. The utility of serial echocardiograms to evaluate improvement in myocardial dysfunction in the brain dead donor and to better predict cardiac allograft survival has been reported in adults [65] and is evolving into routine practice.

Justifications for PAC are not limited to the precise titration of hemodynamic support but are also required for the evaluation of suitability for heart and lung transplantation.

Some authors advocate maintaining a CVP of 10\u201312 mmHg to volume replete those patients in whom only abdominal organs are to be procured, a CVP < 8 mmHg for potential lung donors and a CVP of 8\u201310 mmHg if both thoracic and abdominal organs are to be harvested [79].

Brain death and hypotension are often associated with vasopressin deficiency [89]. Low-dose AVP infusions have been shown to improve hemodynamic stability and spare catecholamine use [89, 90]. Prolonged hemodynamic stability can be maintained after brain death with low-dose AVP (1\u20132 units/h), permitting a significant decrease in epinephrine and extended preservation of renal function [91]. In a rigorous, randomized study of volume-resuscitated brain dead organ donors supported with dopamine, 0.30 mU/kg/min infusion of AVP significantly increased MAP and SVR and spared dopamine use compared to further fluid loading [92]. Pediatric donors given AVP (41 \u00b1 69 mU/kg/h) respond by increasing MAP and weaning alpha-agonists (norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine) without significant differences in the quality of kidneys, livers and hearts recovered [21, 93].

It may be secondary to insulin resistance as pancreatic function appears to be preserved [104], which may be aggravated by corticosteroid therapy and dextrose-based fluid replacements used for diabetes insipidus. Insulin is variably and inconsistently considered as part of hormonal resuscitation cocktails. The hypothesis that tight glycemic control in the brain dead donor improves graft survival has not been tested, but has been recommended by expert consensus [68, 69]. Hyperglycemia has been shown to be an independent risk factor for poor outcome after severe brain injury in children [105] and adults [106].",

In a rabbit and porcine model, improved liver transplant survival was shown from donors receiving enteral nutrition versus fasting donors [110]. A significant improvement in hepatic sinusoidal lining cell viability has been demonstrated in rats with liver grafts from donors receiving enteral feeding and intraperitoneal glucose prior to liver procurement.

Studies of donor-specific predictors of graft function following liver transplantation suggested a length of stay in the ICU of greater than 3 days as a risk factor [113]. A contributing factor to this association may be the effect of starvation on the liver with depletion of glycogen stores. In a controlled prospective randomized study of 32 patients it was shown that an intraportal infusion of insulin (1 IU/kg/h) and glucose reglycogenates the liver, increases glycogen utilization during cold and rewarming periods, and improves transaminase levels [114]. However, the only human series of liver transplants that included donor nutritional status failed to identify an independent effect of donor nutrition on postoperative liver graft function [115]. As a general approach, intravenous dextrose infusions should be given routinely and routine enteral or parenteral feeding should be initiated or continued as tolerated [116].",

Histologic observations of the pituitary gland demonstrate various degrees of edema, hemorrhage, and tissue necrosis depending on the mechanism and site of traumatic or ischemic brain injury [118, 119]. This is likely to be a result of compromised blood supply to the cell bodies arising in the deep supraventricular and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, whose neurons supply the posterior pituitary and regulate AVP secretion. Anterior pituitary function is often preserved, implying that some blood supply via the hypophyseal arteries, which arise extradurally, is reaching the median eminence of the hypothalamus [117]. Undetectable levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) have been noted in 75 % of brain dead donors, and diabetes insipidus is present in up to 87 % [29, 30, 54, 55]. Diabetes insipidus may commonly appear prior to the diagnosis of brain death [118] and is associated with hemodynamic instability and the compromise of transplantable organ function [2, 23, 77].",

In pediatric case series, doses of vasopressin between 0.25 and 2.7 mU/kg/h have been used to successfully treat hypothalamic diabetes insipidus [131\u2013134]. Doses between 0.5 and 15 U/h of AVP have been advocated in adults, though there are concerns about high doses causing coronary, renal and splanchnic vasoconstriction, potentially jeopardizing cardiac, renal, pancreatic and hepatic function [99, 127]. The safety and efficacy of a combination of DDAVP (for its antidiuretic effect) with AVP as a vasopressor on cardiovascular and laboratory endpoints has been described [21, 92, 135]. Many protocols recommend separate dosing regimens for diabetes insipidus and support for perfusion. The upper limit of AVP recommended by the Transplantation Committee of the American College of Cardiology is 0.8\u20131.0 U/h (13\u201317 mU/kg/h) to treat diabetes insipidus [72].",

The use of thyroid hormone therapy in brain dead donors is largely based on experimental animal models and human case series. Investigators describe variable levels of thyroid hormones after brain death and varying and conflicting effects of thyroid hormone administration. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), T4 and T3 levels were below normal in a majority of 22 brain dead donors [137]. Other studies have shown that these patients are suffering from \u201csick euthyroid syndrome\u201d rather than TSH deficiency and do not require thyroid supplementation [54]. In the baboon model, T3 levels become depleted after brain death and the resulting transition to anaerobic metabolism is reversed with T3 replacement [138]. The positive effects on myocardial gene expression have been demonstrated [139].",

A recent analysis of the California Donor Network database demonstrated an independent effect of methylprednisolone on the successful procurement of lungs from the donor [152]. The UNOS database showed that heart graft survival benefit was also found in those donors receiving corticosteroids alone [150]. Recent studies do reveal a highly proinflammatory environment in donors but do not actually show benefit from methyprednisolone replacement [20].

The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database shows a 46 % reduced odds of post-transplant death within 30 days and a 48 % reduced odds of early cardiac graft dysfunction with the use of combined hormonal therapy in a large retrospective cohort [150]. Benefit was also found in those donors receiving corticosteroids alone or in combination with T3/T4 which is supported by independent studies [153, 154]. Recovery of organs was most beneficial to heart and lung transplantation [155]. Analysis of UNOS data suggests a substantial benefit from hormone therapy with minimal risk. A multivariate logistic regression analysis of 18,726 brain dead donors showed significant increases in kidney, liver and heart utilization from donors receiving three-drug hormonal therapy. Significant improvements in 1-year kidney graft survival and heart transplant patient survival were also demonstrated [147, 148, 150]. More recently, however, in a prospective randomized study T3 and methylprednisolone did not add to the effect on cardiac index shown by vasopressin and aggressive cardiovascular support [156]. Despite this recent finding, current expert consensus still strongly recommends the use of combined hormonal therapy for any donor with hemodynamic instability or reduced ejection fraction on echocardiography [68, 69].",

Prospective studies for transfusion thresholds suggest outcomes are similar with hemoglobin level at 7 g/dL in critically ill children [157]. However, consensus conferences recommend maintaining a hemoglobin level \u2265 10 g/dL or a hematocrit greater than 30 % [127, 130]. Large platelet transfusion requirements during liver transplant surgery are independently associated with more severe hepatic dysfunction after transplantation, but this is likely more indicative of a more technically complicated procedure and sicker recipient [115]. There is no literature identified to guide platelet or plasma factor replacement in the donor. Invasive procedures associated with bleeding risk may require correction of thrombocytopenia and coagulation status. Blood drawing for donor serology and tissue typing should occur prior to transfusions to minimize the risk of false results related to hemodilution. In regions where blood is routinely leukocyte depleted, and the risk of transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) is negligible and it may not be necessary to give CMV-negative blood to CMV-negative donors [69].",

While approximately 5 % of all donors will be bacteremic at the time of procurement, the routine use of broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftazidime/cefotaxime) in the recipient has been shown to prevent transmission of bacterial infection in organ recipients [164, 165]. Importantly, donor infections do not show differences in acute mortality or graft survival. The current expansion of potential marginal donors has increased the risk of infection. One study quoted bacteremia rates in the donor up to 21 % [166]. Donors with ICU stays greater than 3 days, rescue CPR, and inotropic agents are at increased risk [167]. Though rates of infections in donors may be up, organs obtained from donors with positive cultures continue to be transplanted safely, likely due to vigilant screening and polymicrobial therapy given to recipients [168, 169]. Other authors have described the successful transplantation of organs from donors declared brain dead from meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitides, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli without transmission to the recipient [170]. The finding of positive cultures does not preclude donation but may delay procurement until 24\u201348 h of treatment has been established. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy in the organ donor is generally not recommended.",

In children, initial echocardiography for heart donor evaluation should be performed only after hemodynamic resuscitation and repeat echocardiography should be considered after \u22656 h [69]. Intensive donor management has been show to improve function on serial echocardiography and may improve transplantability in up to 50 % [66, 184, 185]. Some advocate that the majority of echographic abnormalities in donor hearts resolve in the transplant recipient prior to discharge [186]. Reduced function should not preclude consideration for transplantation based on a single evaluation. Ejection fractions < 40\u201345 % do not necessarily translate into high transplant risk, as they may be related to related to inadequate cardiovascular resuscitation or neurogenic myocardial dysfunction that is reversible with time (see earlier sections). Adult data has shown significant improvements in echocardiographic function with time and conventional support [65], with up to 78 % of potential donors demonstrating clinically significant improvements [63, 184].",

Pathological studies of lungs rejected for donation have indicated that bronchopneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, and diffuse lung consolidation are the three most common reasons for being deemed unsuitable [214]. Between 76 % and 97 % of bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) will grow at least one organism [224, 225]. The most commonly identified organisms included Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter, and in 43 % of transplants, similar organisms were isolated from recipient bronchoscopy. Pulmonary infection in the graft recipient results in significantly lower survival compared with recipients who do not develop early graft infection [226]. Recipients with donor BAL cultures positive for either gram positive or gram negative bacteria had longer mean mechanical ventilation times and inferior 6-month to 4-year survival than those with negative bacterial BAL cultures [227]. Trauma donors (versus intracerebral hemorrhage) may be at higher risk for aspiration and for intubation under less sterile field conditions and were generally ventilated longer [228]. The etiology of donor death is not associated with lung transplant mortality [204] but may influence the type of organisms found on BAL and subsequent graft infection risk. The high rates of positive bacterial and fungal BAL results suggest the need for more aggressive critical care management and antibiotic therapy [229].",

In a cohort of 323 orthotopic liver transplants (OLT), longer donor hospitalization was not found to be associated with primary liver graft dysfunction [239]. Large platelet transfusion requirements during surgery are independently associated with more severe hepatic dysfunction after transplantation [115], although this may be indicative of a more technically complicated procedure, sicker recipient, or poor quality graft with subsequently greater sequestration of platelets within the donor liver [242]. As with other organs, the mechanisms of brain death itself impact the donor liver [243]. With the use of marginal livers for transplantation, studies are identifying more factors that may impact graft survival such as the liver\u2019s gross appearance, the donor P/F ratio, and the donor hemoglobin [244].",

Donor hemodynamic instability is correlated with post-transplant acute tubular necrosis in adults [77, 267, 268] and children [2]. Reduced graft survival or acute tubular necrosis may occur in organs retrieved from donors receiving high-dose dopamine (>10 \u03bcg/kg/min) but these effects may be limited to donors who are hypotensive at the time of organ retrieval [268]. Hemodynamic resuscitation may improve outcome as donor use of dopamine and/or noradrenaline is independently associated with a lower risk of acute rejection [269], lower rate of delayed graft function [84, 270], and reduces the need for recipient dialysis [271]. In adults, donor hypertension is also a risk factor for inferior outcomes [272].

Because of this, many feel that intestinal transplantation as an option is still premature and remains unique to specialized centres only [281, 282]. For the brain dead donor, non-absorbable antibiotics for selective bowel decontamination are sometimes used for liver and intestine transplantation to prevent postoperative infections. Results are best if given >3 days prior to transplantation [283]. A meta-analysis showed an 84 % relative risk reduction in the incidence of gram negative infection following liver transplantation; however, the risk of antimicrobial resistance should be considered [284]. More recent studies have not duplicated these results. At this time, selective bowel decontamination is not routinely administered [285].",

Evidence has shown that multidisciplinary donor management protocols can improve donation outcomes [286, 287]. When these strategies are used, there are a significantly improved number of organs transplanted per donor [3, 4]. This is mostly attributed to the improvement in basic cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring and treatment [288\u2013290]. Improved multimodal strategies aimed at preserving organ function specifically may increase numbers of potential donors, especially with the increasing use of \u201cmarginal\u201d donors [81]. These protocols need to be supported with appropriate medical and nursing education [291\u2013293] and influencing attitudinal changes for the role of donor [294]. Policies for organ donation and management should be developed with aim to change the culture at the bedside and with hospital administration [295, 296].",

In a large cohort study of 1,106 renal transplant recipients, longer duration of brain death (time from declaration of brain death to onset of cold ischemia) was associated with improved initial graft function and graft survival, suggesting that the time taken to optimize donor cardiovascular status may reduce ischemic injury [273]. Despite early reports to the contrary [113], liver allograft dysfunction is not associated with prolonged ICU stay by multivariate analysis [239, 241]. A period of time may be needed to determine the trend of elevated AST or ALT, as generally accepted upper limits may be exceeded if the levels are falling rapidly (e.g., following a hypotensive episode with resuscitation).",

Although the non-utilization of organs is most commonly related to organ dysfunction, it is also related to donor characteristics and/or flaws in the processes of transplant evaluation and decision making. A four-center Canadian review of heart and lung utilization identified deficits in the consent to individual organs, the offering of organs, and the utilization of offered organs unrelated to organ dysfunction [297]. Consent should be requested for all organs regardless of baseline function and all organs should be offered. Ideally, final decisions about transplantability should rest with the individual transplant programs represented by the organ-specific transplant doctors.",
