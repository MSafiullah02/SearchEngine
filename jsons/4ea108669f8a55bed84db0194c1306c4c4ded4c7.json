In this investigation, IgG and its corresponding antibody are selected as a couple of model molecules for the optimization of ligand surface concentration.

In common sense, the amount of captured target bio-molecule might be proportional to the surface concentration of ligand, so the ligand surface concentration is usually used at its saturation level. However, the phenomenon is observed through the interaction between Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and its corresponding antibody that the surface concentration of BSA/anti-BSA binding complex rises firstly and then de-clines, as the surface concentration of BSA simply increases [8] . It is suggested that ligand surface concentration at its saturation may not be the optimization result.",
