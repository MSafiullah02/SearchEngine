The girl had a history of good physical health with no underlying diseases, but she had returned to Jingzhou (Hubei province of China) from Wuhan with her parents 10 days before. Of note, her parents had been diagnosed with COVID\u201019 using real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR for the viral RNA from oropharyngeal specimens two days earlier. Physical examination of the girl revealed fever (38.2\u00b0C), and laboratory examination revealed high neutrophil levels (86.2%) and reduced lymphocytes (7.1%). On January 31, 2020, the oropharyngeal swabs of the patient were positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. A chest CT indicated no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities. On the 2nd day after admission, her temperature returned to normal. On the 4th day, diarrhea completely recovered. The oropharyngeal swab was negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 on the 14th day after onset of the illness. However, the anal swabs remained positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 on the 28th day after the onset of the illness (Table 1). The infant has been discharged on March 1 and is in good condition now.",

Lu et al\n11\n showed that the structure of the receptor\u2010binding domains between SARS\u2010CoV and the novel SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was similar using molecular modeling, indicating that ACE2 might also be the receptor for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, although amino acids in the receptor\u2010binding domain of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are different from those of SARS\u2010CoV. The abundant presence of ACE2 in the epithelia of the lung and intestine is widely acknowledged, and this ACE2 might be part of one route of COVID\u201019 transmission. Previous studies have proved the presence of viral nucleic acids in fecal samples and anal swabs of patients with COVID\u201019, but the implications of this require further investigation.\n12\n The possibility of fecal\u2010oral transmission in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection should be taken into consideration. More attention should be paid to the hand hygiene and disinfection of patients\u2019 vomitus, feces, and other excretions.",

Current discharge standards are as follows: The patient\u2019s body temperature must remain normal for over 3 days; respiratory symptoms must be significantly relieved; lung inflammation must show obvious signs of absorption; and tests for viral nucleic acid must be negative for two consecutive times, sampled at least one day apart.\n12\n If we had not tested this anal swab, the patient might have been discharged from the hospital half a month ago. Given that the patient was 3 months old, her caregivers were likely to be exposed to feces or other body fluids containing the virus. We conclude that when discharged patients are isolated at home, their family members should pay very close attention to hand hygiene and avoid sharing a toilet with patients wherever possible. In households without a separate toilet, patients can be isolated and the rest room must be disinfected using 75% ethanol, chlorine containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform, or other fat solvents after each use.",
