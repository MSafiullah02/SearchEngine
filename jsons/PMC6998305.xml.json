            "text": "Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) is an important haematophagous gastrointestinal parasite of small ruminants. It can suck about 0.05 mL blood per day [1, 2] and may cause acute anemia, edema, diarrhea, severe frailty weight loss, and ultimately death [3, 4]. Due to high mortality and morbidity rate, H. contortus infection causes significant economic losses to small ruminants particularly in humid, tropical and subtropical regions [5, 6]. China mainly contributes 17.3% of world\u2019s total goat population [7] in which different prevalence rate of H. contortus infection has been reported in several provinces [8]. The control of this parasite mainly relies on accurate and early diagnosis. Conventional fecal egg counts technique is main method to diagnose this infection clinically but it is difficult to detect H. contortus eggs in feces before 21\u201325 days of infection [4]. Last larval stages of this parasite feed on blood [9] and may suck up to 1/5th of total circulating erythrocyte volume in young animal [10]. H. contortus blood feeding starts at 11th day of infection [11] but clinical signs usually become apparent when infection becomes severe [12]. Another way for the diagnosis of this infection depends on the degree of anemia using FAMACHA system in which an ocular conjunctiva color chart is used for assessment of anemia to decide which animal requires treatment for H. contortus infection [13]. However, these methods are often nonspecific, insensitive, laborious, time consuming [14] and most importantly lacking the ability to detect the infection at early stage. Hence, early detection of H. contortus is crucial and necessary to control infection effectively [15].",

ESPs have been widely used as diagnostic antigen because these products have good specificity and sensitivity [17]. ESPs contain numerous proteins which depress the immunity of host at prepatent stages of infection by modulating immune system [18]. Recently, immunoblotting and ELISA based on different types of antigens (somatic and crude) have been reported for the detection of H. contortus specific antibodies [4, 15, 19, 20]. However, shared antigenic composition is major disadvantage of these antigens that leads to cross-reactivity in the diagnosis of H. contortus infection [21]. Currently, there is a lack of potential immunogenic antigen which can accurately detect the particular infectious stage of this helminth in goat. To overcome these challenges and to improve control strategies, a potential antigen based immunodiagnostic assay is needed [15].",

In our previous proteomic study, interaction of H. contortus (Hc)ESPs with host peripheral blood cells at different developmental stages was reported. The Cold Shock domain containing protein (CS) is one of these HcESPs, that binds to goat PBMCs at L4 and L5\nH. contortus development stages [23]. Hence the presence of CS protein may serve for diagnostic purposes as biomarker [24].

Moreover, immunoblotting results showed that initial antibodies were detected in sera of all artificially infected goats (5/5) of group 1 collected at prepatent stage (14 D.P.I). The sera of all H. contortus-infected goats had detectable antigenicity at 21, 35, 49, 63, 85, and 103 days of infection, no IgG antibody against rHc-CS was detected in sera collected at day pre-infection and 7 D.P.I (Fig. 2). On the other hand, FECs showed that strongylid eggs were detected in all samples collected at 21 D.P.I (mean \u00b1 SEM = 7.4 \u00b1 0.6), 28 D.P.I (mean \u00b1 SEM = 9.8 \u00b1 0.78) and 35 D.P.I (mean \u00b1 SEM = 10.8 \u00b1 1.08) but the fecal samples collected at 0, 7 and 14 D.P.I were negative for eggs. Furthermore, occurrence of H. contortus worms was confirmed at 30 D.P.I by necropsy in all tested goats. Moreover, the recombinant Hc-CS antigen did not show any cross-reactivity against goat sera infected with T. spiralis, F. hepatica and T. gondii (Fig. 3). These findings revealed that rHc-CS protein had good immune-reactivity and antigenic characteristics which detected the specific antibody during early and late stages of H. contortus infection. Conversely, H. contortus infection was not detected by microscopic examination at early stage (7 and 14 D.P.I).\n\n\n",

Furthermore, recombinant protein, having high immunoreactive concentration, may act as best immunodiagnostic antigen by achieving high sensitivity and specificity [29\u201336].

A confirmatory test for immunoblotting-positive sera was required to overcome the possible false positive results that may affect the certain diagnosis of infection [17]. In this study, immunoblotting results indicated that rHc-CS showed high immunoreactivity against polyclonal antibodies generated in sera of SD rats. The ELISA is a powerful tool as it provides a less time consuming, easy and safe way to perform serological detection. Therefore the association between ELISA and immunoblotting techniques can be seen as a potent way to increase sensitivity for immunodiagnosis purposes [38]. Previously, a study was conducted for prepatent detection of specific H. contortus antibody, early and late patency of H. contortus infections using ELISA based on Hc26 and immunoblotting in sheep [37]. Another study was performed using recombinant protein recIgE1\u20132 to detect H. contortus infection in sheep sera collected at 2 to 4 weeks post infection in which immunoblotting assay showed cross-reactivity against sheep sera [39]. In contrast, the immunoblotting results of this study revealed that rHc-CS antigen specifically reacted with antibodies present in all H. contortus positive goat sera at 14 D.P.I and persisted until 103 D.P.I. However, no anti-rHc-CS antibodies were detected in uninfected sera collected at day before infection. Previously, crude Excretory-Secretory (ES) protein of H. contortus-based Dot-ELISA was performed using sera collected at 1\u20133 weeks post infection sera but cross reactivity of this antigen with other nematode and trematode was not checked [15]. In contrast to this study, H. contortus antigen showed cross-reactivity against Fasciola hepatica and Moniezia expansa [40]. In previous study, somatic and adult larval antigen showed cross-reactivity with closely-related H. contortus species and possibly other genera [9]. In this study, rHc-CS did not show any cross-reactivity against co-infecting parasites (T. spiralis, F. hepatica and T. gondii). These results proved that specific-antibody detection has more specific and sensitive diagnostic potential as compared to conventional microscopic techniques. Thus, the evaluated rHc-CS can be used as diagnostic antigen to detect specific antibodies effectively during prepatent period of H. contortus infection in goat. Antigenicity, sensitivity and specificity may be influenced by the secretion time of antigen. It has been reported earlier that rHc-CS releases at 14 and 60 D.P.I and antibodies against this molecule are produced [23]. Another possibe reason might be the type of antigen used in study.",

Previously, combined use of ELISA and immunoblotting has been reported as a powerful tool to immuno-diagnose different infections [38, 41]. In this study, rHc-CS indirect-ELISA showed higher diagnostic specificity and sensitivity as compared to somatic antigen-based indirect-ELISA format reported in previous study [20]. This contrast might be due to higher binding efficiency of rHc-CS antigen, as type of diagnostic antigens used in study may influence specificity, sensitivity and cross reactivity of assay [42]. In previous study, indirect ELISA using somatic and adult larval antigen results in relatively lower diagnostic specificity [9]. In present study, both sensitivity and specificity of the rHc-CS indirect-ELISA were measured as 100%, that is similar to the findings of previous study in which His-ES24-based ELISA was performed to detect specific antibodies in H. contortus infected sera of sheep [17]. In contrast, 90% [43] and 87% [41] diagnostic sensitivity of indirect ELISA was reported using different recombinant H. contortus tropomyosin antigens.",

To determine the background noise reactions, optimization of best antigen and antibodies dilution are crucial to increase the diagnostic potential of indirect ELISA. After standardization of rHc-CS based indirect-ELISA, checkerboard titration results showed best performance with optimal coating concentration of antigen (0.28 \u03bcg/well), best serum dilution (1:100) and best working concentrations of secondary antibody (rabbit anti-goat IgG; 1:4000). Type of blocking buffers and their incubating time may also influence the performance of assay and may encourage false positive or false negative reactions [45]. In this study, to minimize this challenge of false reactions, different dilutions of different blocking buffers were optimized with different incubating times. Incubation time of buffer has significant effects on the performance of the assay. Therefore, the optimized results showed that the best blocking buffer was 5% BSA which is same as the findings of previous study [46]. The optimum reactive time of blocking and TMB was recorded as 60 and 10 min, respectively. Furthermore, the best P/N value (6.44) was recorded when serum was incubated for 120 min. To reduce time, serum can be incubated for 60 min because P/N value was observed positive (P/N > 2.1). This optimized rHc-CS based indirect-ELISA will be more authenticated tool for identifying goats in the prepatent stage of H. contortus infection than other antigen-based assays. The results of this study will facilitate the low cost early serological diagnosis of large number of animals and possibly vaccine development against the infection of H. contortus. This assay has high sensitivity and specificity for downstream application in field studies. However, further study is required to assess the cross-reactivity of rHc-CS against other nematodes belonging to Trichostrongylidae family. Additionally, to fine tune this assay epidemiological surveillance studies with huge number of samples are required.",
