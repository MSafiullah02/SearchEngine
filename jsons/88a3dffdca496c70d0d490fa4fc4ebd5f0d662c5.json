In this study, the spatial association between the key demographic variables and COVID-19 cases and deaths were analyzed using the spatial regression models. Total 13 (for COVID-19 case factor) and 8 (for COVID-19 death factor) key variables were considered for the modelling. Total five spatial regression models such as Geographically weighted regression (GWR), Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), Spatial Error_Lag model (SEM_SLM), and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) were performed for the spatial modelling and mapping of model estimates. The local R 2 values, which suggesting the influences of the selected demographic variables on overall casualties caused by COVID-19, was found highest in Italy and the UK. The moderate local R 2 was observed for . The lowest local R 2 value for COVID-19 cases was accounted for Latvia and Lithuania. Among the 13 variables, the highest local R 2 was calculated for total population (R 2 = 0.92), followed by death crude death rate (R 2 = 0.9), long time illness (R 2 = 0.84), population with age >80 (R 2 = 0.59), employment (R 2 = 0.46), life expectancy at 65 (R 2 = 0.34), crude birth rate (R 2 = 0.31), life expectancy (R 2 = 0.31), Population with age 65-80 (R 2 = 0.29), Population with age 15-24 (R 2 = 0.27), Population with age 25-49 (R 2 = 0.27), Population with age 0-14 (R 2 = 0.23), and Population with age 50-65 (R 2 = 0.23), respectively. This suggests that the total population, death crude death rate, long time illness are the key factors that are regulating overall casualties of COVID-19. This study found that the demographic composition of the country predominantly controls the high rate of mortality and casualties due to COVID-19. In this study, the influence of the other controlling factors, such as environmental conditions, socio-ecological status, climatic extremity, etc. have not been considered. This could be scope for future research.",

            "text": "The demographic factor plays a crucial role in shaping the pattern of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths across the globe. According to UNDESA (2019) and WHO (2020), the inter(national) migrants, especially those involved in low-income jobs, are the most affected and vulnerable to death and infection of COVID-19. As of 22 April 2020, the migrants accounted for 10% of the total population for 10 out of the 15 countries having the highest number of COVID-19 cases. However, in many cases, the migrants performed a crucial role in tackling the COVID-19 emergency by working in several critical sectors (UN DESA, 2020; WHO, 2020) . Ageing factor is also found crucial in controlling COVID-19 deaths and spreading. The high number of COVID-19 deaths and infection in Italy may be linked with the demographic structure of the country. The median age of the population in Italy is 46 years, and nearly a quarter of its population over the age of 65 earmarked the country as number 4 th with a higher proportion of the old age population. The same pattern is evident in Spain (the median age of the population is 43.9 years and more than 25000 COVID-19 deaths reported so far in Spain) (Slate, 2020; Population Europe, 2020) . According to WHO (2020) , in Europe, more than 95 percent of people who have died due to COVID-19 have been over 60. The longtime illness and existing respiratory disease history are also found associated with COVID-19 deaths. Zhou et al., (2020) study in Wuhan, China found that patients with existing respiratory diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease, etc. are the most vulnerable to COVID-19 deaths. Almagro & Orane-hutchinson, (2020) developed a regression model to evaluate the statistical significance between the control (neighborhood characteristics, occupations) and response variables in New York City's neighborhoods. This study found that occupations were substantially explaining the observed COVID-19 patterns as people with high-level social outreach and higher social interaction were more vulnerable to be infected to the virus. Several other studies have also evaluated the association between the explanatory variables such as neighborhood characteristics (Borjas, 2020); age structure (Dowd et al., 2020 Kulu & Dorey, 2020 ; psychological interventions (Duan & Zhu, 2020) ; pre-existing health records (Fu et al., 2020) ; population flows and control measures (Kraemer et al., 2020) ; the influence of social and economic ties (Mogi & Spijker, 2020) and COVID-19 cases and deaths across the globe.",

            "text": "This study further advances the assessment of the impact of demographic parameters on the spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths across Europe by adopting spatial regressionbased approaches. Spatial regressions models have been used extensively in many virus studies ranges from local to a global scale (Zhao et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) . Diuk-Wasser et al., (2006) evaluated the spatial distribution of mosquito vectors for West Nile virus in Connecticut, the USA using logistic regression models. Kauhl et al., (2015) have evaluated the spatial distribution of Hepatitis C virus infections and associated determinants using Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) model. Kauhl et al., (2015) advocated the uses of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial epidemiological methods for providing viable screening interventions with identifying spatial hotspots/clusters as well as demographic and socio-economic determinants that have a strong association with the casualties caused by the virus. Linard et al., (2007) study on determinants of the geographic distribution of Puumala virus and Lyme borreliosis infections in Belgium found that the environmental and socio-economic factors play a crucial role in determining the spatial variation in disease risk. Mollalo et al., (2020) performed GIS-based spatial modelling to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic, behavioural environmental, topographic, and demographic factors on COVID-19 incidence in the continental United States and found that different explanatory variables including income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners, etc. largely control the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in the USA. Malesios et al., (2020) study evaluated the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of the bluetongue virus outbreak on the island of Lesvos, Greece, and found a strong spatial autocorrelation between the spread of bluetongue virus and farms located nearby. Since COVID-19 a novel virus and no study is available so far that evaluate the close association between the demographic determinants and spread of COVID-19, this study has made an effort to address the mentioned research gap and to provide effective solutions for future preparedness for COVID-19 like situation.",

Understanding the spatial effects such as spatial autocorrelation, spatial stationarity, and heterogeneity of a feature distribution is one of the fundamental applications of spatial regression models. In this study, total five spatial regression models include Geographically weighted regression (GWR), Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), Spatial Error_Lag model (SEM_SLM), and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) models were implemented to evaluate how the demographic factors are shaping the pattern of COVID-19 case/deaths across Europe. Among these five regression models, the global interaction between the demographic factors and COVID-19 cases/deaths were analyzed using OLS, SEM, SLM, and SEM_SLM models as these model are not impacted by spatial autocorrelation or homogeneity in the feature space. The local association between the control and response variables was calculated using the GWR model.",

For the COVID-19 case factor, the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) value was recorded as 0.79, while for the death factors, the linear model has explained 64% model variances (Fig. 5 , Using the combination of demographic variables and the GWR model, the prediction of COVID-19 cases and deaths was performed and presented in Fig. 6 . For the case factor, 93% model accuracy was observed between the actual and predicted COVID-19 cases. For the death factor, the accuracy was 97% between the predicted and actual COVID-19 death. The GWR based prediction for both case and death factors suggesting the effectivity of spatial regression models in explaining predicting the casualties caused by any epidemic/pandemic in the future time.

For the case factor, a total 5 out of 13 variables have been strongly associated with the spread and COVID-19 cases.

The fundamental function of OLS is to optimize the regression coefficients (\u03b2) by reducing the sum of squared prediction errors (Anselin and Arribas-Bel, 2013; Mollalo et al., 2020; Oshan et al., 2019). The usual OLS method assumes that the residual errors are homogenous and un-correlated and thereby the traditional OLS has proven to be inefficient when the errors are heterogeneous and spatially correlated and lead to a bias in regression coefficient estimation (Goodchild et al., 1993; Yang & Jin, 2010).",

            "text": "According toKraemer et al. (2020), the human mobility factor is substantially explaining the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China as the growth rates become stable or negative in some areas where strong control measures were implemented and mandatorily imposed.However, the mobility factors in the other regions where the stringent regulations were not implemented, still pose severe threats by transmitting the infection in the closest neighbours(Kraemer et al., 2020).The spatial association between the demographic variables and COVID-19 cases and deaths were found maximum in the southern, western European regions. All the 13 demographic variables considered for spatial regression modelling produced higher local R 2 estimates for Italy, Spain, France, Germany, UK, Greece, Bulgaria, Belgium, Netherland, Ireland. All these countries have been affected badly in terms of the total number of cases and deaths caused by COVID-19. Conversely, the weak association between demographic variables and the COVID-19 case factor was found in the eastern European countries (Estonia, Latvia, Finland). Several factors are responsible for this uneven distribution of spatial association. This includes the age structure of the population, ratio of the elderly population, ratio of dependent population, the socio-economic structure of the society, etc. Considering the spatial association between the demographic variables and the COVID-19 death factor, the maximum values were accounted for the southern European countries, i.e., Italy, Croatia, Greece, Slovenia, France, Spain, UK, Ireland, Norway. While slightly lower estimates wereobserved in the eastern European regions. The intercept values calculated for the two response variables (cases and deaths) were followed the same pattern as observed for the COVID-19 death factor. The individual influences of all the13 and 8 demographic variables on COVID-19 cases and deaths exhibited distinctive spatial association and explained substantial model variances. Among the 13 variables chosen for COVID-19 case factors, Tot_Pop, Pop>80, LIlln_Edu, and D_CDR were correlated strongly with the case factor. For the death factor, Tot_Pop, D_CDR, Pov, LIlln_Edu explained the maximum model variances. Demographic pattern and structure of a country can substantially modulate the overall impact of a widespread pandemic and therefore may be epidemiologically informative (Jia et al., 2020); Dowd et al., 2020; Mollalo et al., 2020; Borjas, 2020; Almagro & Orane-hutchinson, 2020). In many cases, the socio-economic determinants play a crucial role in amplifying casualties due to COVID-19. Therefore, it has been suggested that paying more attention to controlling (inter)national migration, restricted population flows, modernizing the healthcare system by improving diagnosis and treatment capacity, and upgrading the public welfare system to make it fully functional for the crisis situation, could be the point of interest in order to fight against the COVID-19 like situation effectively(Su et al., 2020). The availability of sufficient SARS-CoV-2 testing centers is also found to be important for adopting control strategies and decision making for minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on the overall socioecological system(Rader et al., 2020).Rader et al. ( 2020)  also reported the that in the USA, a total of 6,236 unique SARS-CoV-2 testing sites is available for the 3,108 counties and nearly 30%, 86%, and 5% of the total population, mountain population, and middle Atlantic population is lived in counties with median travel times over 20 min. The demographic parameters like population density, % of minority to total population, % of population with noinsurance and median income range of the population were found to be the main determinants of median travel time to testing sites. Moreover, the accessibility to SARS-Cov-2 testing sites in USA is increased with high population density and lower % of minority and uninsured people(Rader et al., 2020).Using all the (non)spatial regression models including GWR, OLS, SLM, SER, SLM_SEM, PCR, PLS, MLR, the individual and collective effect of the demographic variables on COVID-19 cases and deaths were analyzed and reported. Among the 13 variables considered for COVID-19 case factor, Tot_Pop, D_CDR, Pop>80, LIlln_Edu, LExp, LExp_65, and Emplo factors were strongly associated with the COVID-19 cases across the European region. A similar association was observed between the demographic factors and COVID-19 in Wuhan, China (Wu et al., 2020). Wu et al., (2020) examined the association between preexisting illness of the patients, including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and",
