The RNAi effector molecules, termed siRNAs, are RNA duplexes \u223c21\u201325 nucleotides (nt) in length (Figure 1\n). These small RNA fragments are defined as the products of longer dsRNA processing by an RNase III type enzyme, called Dicer. Once introduced in the cell's cytoplasm, siRNAs are incorporated into a protein complex termed RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) that contains the Argonaute 2 (Ago2) endonuclease [14]. Only one strand of the RNA duplex is retained inside the RISC, which is the antisense strand or guide strand. Subsequently, the activated RISC (RISC*) uses the guide strand to bind to the complementary region on the target mRNA, followed by Ago2-directed transcript cleavage (also called \u2018slicing\u2019) opposite the phosphate linkage between bases 10 and 11 with respect to the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand [15]. The cleavage fragments are then further degraded by cellular RNases.",

The fact that siRNAs employ endogenous cellular machinery is imperative in this regard. siRNA-activated RISC (RISC*) is defined as a multiple-turnover enzyme that follows Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics. Once the mRNA target is cleaved, RISC* is recycled in the RNAi pathway to identify and destroy other mRNAs. This implies that a single enzyme complex can bind and cleave multiple mRNA transcripts [16]. Moreover, RISC can provide additional intracellular stability to the siRNA guide strand and protect it against an armada of single-strand-specific RNases. The entrapment of siRNA into RISC and its catalytic action are key parameters explaining the inherent gene silencing efficiency.",

With these types of duplexes, maximal inhibition and longer gene silencing persistence was observed at concentrations lower than those required for conventional 21mer siRNAs 10, 19, 20.

One of the known amplification mechanisms is \u2018systemic spreading\u2019 of the RNAi silencing effect. This effect is attributed to a dsRNA receptor, denoted as SID-1 in C. elegans, responsible for passive dsRNA translocation over the cell membrane and intercellular dsRNA transport between neighbouring cells 22, 23. The lack of gene silencing when incubating mammalian cells with \u2018naked\u2019 (i.e. unformulated) siRNA makes it likely that, in most mammalian cell types, normal levels of SID-1 homologue expression can be neglected 24, 25. A recent study, however, conducted by Wolfrum et al. revealed that SID-1 is at least partially responsible for the in vitro hepatocellular uptake of lipophilic siRNAs when they are incorporated in lipoprotein complexes such as HDL and LDL (high and low density lipoprotein, respectively) [26]. Specific RNAi silencing of SID-1 expression in HepG2 cells and blocking of extracellular SID-1 epitopes with SID-1 antibodies seemed to decrease the cellular internalization and subsequent silencing effect of lipophilic siRNAs targeted against apolipoprotein B (apoB) [26].",

As Figure 2 illustrates, the first step in the production of miRNA occurs in the cell nucleus, where long primary transcripts (called pri-miRNA) are expressed from endogenous genetic regions and processed by Drosha (a RNAse III enzyme) into \u223c60\u201370 nt hairpins with imperfect complementarities in their stems [36]. These precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are shuttled from the nucleus into the cytoplasm through the Exportin-5/Ran-GTP heterodimer complex [37]. In the cytosol, Dicer processes pre-miRNA into mature \u223c22 nt miRNA duplexes that interact with RISC to modulate transcriptome expression [38]. Mammalian miRNAs, which tend to contain mismatches with the target mRNA, most often mediate gene silencing through translational suppression rather than transcript slicing, although the latter has also been described. It is believed that the binding of activated miRISC* to the target mRNA sequesters the latter from the translational machinery through confinement in cytoplasmic foci, called processing bodies (P bodies), thereby preventing protein synthesis [39].",

            "text": "In analogy with miRNA biogenesis, the intracellular processing of shRNAs originates in the cell nucleus, where Exportin-5 is responsible for its nuclear export [40]. In the cytoplasm, these shRNAs are again cleaved by Dicer to yield the active 21mer siRNAs [32]. In correspondence with Dicer substrate RNAs (DisRNAs), plasmid vectors can be designed to produce shRNAs (29 nt stem, 4 nt loop) with higher RNAi potency over smaller hairpin RNAs (19 nt stem, 4 nt loop) owing to improved Dicer recognition and RISC incorporation [41]. However, in a recent report by Li et al., it was shown that, in the context of a 9 nt loop, the shRNA with a 19 nt stem outperformed the longer 29 nt shRNA [42]. The explanation for this discrepancy again lies in the ability of the shRNA to be recognized by Dicer. Indeed, whereas shRNAs with a 19 nt stem and a 4 nt loop bypass Dicer cleavage, increasing the loop length to 9 nt also turns shRNAs with a 19 nt stem into Dicer substrates 42, 43. Building on our increased understanding of miRNA processing, second-generation shRNAs were developed (called shRNAmir) [44]. In contrast to first-generation shRNA that elicit structural analogy with pre-miRNA, shRNAmir are transcribed as pri-miRNA. Their design is founded on the human miRNA, miR-30, of which the stem is replaced with an RNA sequence of interest. The advantage of shRNAmir over shRNA lies in their recognition and processing by both Drosha (nucleoplasm) and Dicer (cytoplasm), leading to a more efficient intracellular production of mature siRNAs and increased knockdown efficiency [45].",

            "text": "Important in the context of this review is to note that, compared with synthetic siRNAs that induce a transient knockdown, plasmid vector based interference shows better potential for long-term gene silencing [46]. To establish stable RNAi gene silencing in cultured cells, researchers mostly appeal to viral expression vectors [32]. Lentiviral vectors allow genomic insertion of the shRNA expressing transgene, while adenoviral and adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) show less successful integration and viral DNA remains largely episomal [47]. Genomic integration of shRNA expression cassettes per definition results in stable RNAi-mediated gene silencing because the target gene remains silenced as long as transcription of siRNA precursors proceeds. This RNAi gene therapy approach can be of interest to study loss-of-function phenotypes following prolonged knockdown of a target gene and for long-term treatment of chronic diseases (e.g. viral infections such as hepatitis B [48] and hepatitis C), thereby easing the treatment schedule and improving patient comfort. However, in a clinical setting, the use of synthetic siRNAs for transient RNAi gene silencing may be advantageous over continuous shRNA/siRNA production as the dosing schedule (and consequently also the resulting intracellular siRNA concentrations) in a therapeutic regimen can be more easily adapted in relation to therapeutic needs [49]. Additionally, transgenes that are stably integrated in the host genome can be silenced rapidly by histone modifications and hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region. Instead of achieving long-term transgene expression, this chromatin silencing will result in a gradual extinction of transgene activity [50].",

In this regard, synthetic 21mer siRNAs that function further downstream in the RNAi pathway are the better and safer choice because they bypass Dicer cleavage and do not require nuclear export for their activity 40, 55. When synthetic siRNAs are employed, however, vigilance is still required, as an intracellular excess of siRNA may possibly interfere with RISC availability, which can also induce competition with cellular miRNAs 55, 56, 57, 58. A recent report, describing potent and specific knockdown of hepatocyte-specific genes in mice and hamsters after systemic delivery of lipid-formulated siRNAs, also demonstrated that the treatment schedule did not influence either miRNA biogenesis or miRNA function [59]. As our knowledge on miRNAs expands, we will be able to better assess any possible cellular disturbances as a result of siRNA/shRNA treatment. Quantitative data on the total number of cellular protein molecules involved in the RNAi pathway and the number of siRNA molecules needed inside a cell for a sufficient silencing effect could be very helpful towards optimization of siRNA therapy without the aforementioned toxicity issues [57].",

Although at present viruses are still the most efficient gene delivery vectors, the combination of these adverse effects could eventually favour a non-viral approach. Meanwhile, non-viral strategies have also been explored extensively for intracellular shRNA production [46]. siRNA expression plasmids can be introduced in the target cell by complexing with cationic lipids and polymers or by physical methods like electroporation and microinjection. Unfortunately, the nuclear import of the plasmid DNA (pDNA) vector remains the predominant bottleneck in the gene delivery process [62], thereby giving preference to synthetic siRNAs that function mainly in the cell cytoplasm. Non-dividing cells are especially difficult to transfect with non-viral vectors, since insufficient amounts of the pDNA can reach the nucleus in the absence of cell division during which the nuclear barrier is temporarily disassembled [63].",

When naked siRNA is injected intravenously it is recognized and cleaved by RNase A type nucleases [64], limiting the serum half-life to <30 min. Therefore, much effort has been undertaken to modify siRNA therapeutics chemically, in order to reduce their susceptibility to serum RNases 10, 65, 66. Chemical modifications include RNA backbone modifications [e.g. phosphorothioates (PS) and boranophosphates], 2\u2032 ribose modifications and terminal 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 modifications, among others [67]. Initially, some concerns were raised with regard to the possible diminished efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs, owing to interference with RISC incorporation, activation and/or recycling. Since then, however, elaborate research in this field has proved that chemically modified siRNA can also efficiently lower mRNA levels through a sequence-specific RNAi-dependent pathway and that some modifications even show enhanced gene silencing compared with the unmodified counterpart 68, 69.",

            "text": "An important consideration to make is whether or not chemical modifications, with the aim of improving the extracellular siRNA stability, are promising in light of prolonging the knockdown of a target gene. One could expect chemically modified siRNAs to have a higher bioavailability because they stay intact for a longer period of time in the blood circulation, thereby also improving the intensity and duration of the RNAi gene silencing effect. Unexpectedly, Layzer et al. were not able to demonstrate a stronger silencing or persistence of silencing for stabilized 2\u2032 fluoro pyrimidine siRNAs over the unmodified 2\u2032 OH siRNAs after hydrodynamic tail vein injection [70]. Most probably, sufficiently high concentrations of both siRNAs can reach the intracellular target site after hydrodynamic injection and can exert an effect before nuclease digestion becomes prominent. In contrast to these findings, a modified siRNA duplex, targeted against hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA and where all ribose 2\u2032 OHs were substituted, was shown to be more efficient in decreasing HBV DNA and HBV surface antigen serum levels when compared with non-modified siRNA [66]. In the same report, hydrodynamic injection was used to co-deliver the siRNA and a replication competent HBV vector. Surprisingly, the difference in activity between modified and unmodified siRNA was only significant at the high-dose level and almost absent at lower doses [66]. When in vivo siRNA degradation by nucleases is the main limiting factor, one would expect to observe the opposite trend. This also indicates that factors other than increased nuclease resistance have to be taken into account when working with chemically modified siRNAs.",

A more convenient strategy to modulate and improve the siRNA biodistribution is the more dramatic alteration of siRNA structure by conjugation to small molecular weight moieties 67, 72, 73. Interesting examples are the coupling of siRNA to heavy-chain antibody Fab fragments [74] or lipidic moieties like cholesterol, bile acids and long-chain fatty acids 26, 75. Lipophilic siRNAs seem to incorporate selectively in lipoprotein particles that are rich in phospholipids and cholesterol (mainly HDL and LDL). These lipophilic siRNA\u2013lipoprotein complexes are able to improve siRNA biodistribution by evading renal clearance and promoting cellular uptake through HDL and LDL lipoprotein receptors [26]. Chimeric peptide\u2013siRNA complexes have recently been shown to protect mice against infection with Japanese encephalitis virus by delivering their siRNA payload into the brain after intravenous injection [76]. Intriguingly, the majority of the siRNA-treated mice survived for over four weeks, while all animals in the control group died within 10 days. Rozema et al. recently introduced a novel polymer based siRNA-conjugate strategy (termed dynamic polyconjugates) for in vivo hepatocytic targeting. These conjugates (\u223c10 nm in size) consist of a reversibly shielded membrane-destabilizing polycation, containing a cleavable targeting ligand, to which siRNA is linked through an intracellularly reducible disulfide bond. Effective knockdown of two endogenous hepatic genes apoB and peroxisome proliferators activated receptor alpha (ppara) was demonstrated in wild-type mice following low pressure i.v. injection [77].",

Paying proper attention to the \u2018packaging\u2019 of siRNAs can lead to constructs where the siRNA molecules are shielded from circulating RNases and destabilizing blood components, eliminating the need for chemical modification 78, 79, 80. Many inventive siRNA formulations have already shown to improve the in vivo potency of siRNAs dramatically 3, 11, 57, 72, 81, 82, 83. A textbook case underlining the importance of siRNA formulation is given by Morrissey et al. When administering unformulated backbone stabilized anti-HBV siRNAs through hydrodynamic tail vein injection an effective inhibition of HBV replication could be achieved, albeit at a dramatically high dosing regimen of three daily doses of 30 mg/kg [66]. However, formulating the therapeutic siRNAs into stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALPs) of \u223c140 nm in size, these investigators succeeded in achieving a significant and long-term reduction of HBV activity by three daily injections of 3 mg/kg/d siRNA followed by a weekly administered maintenance dose for up to six weeks [84]. A more recent report, using SNALP technology to deliver anti-ApoB siRNA in cynomolgus monkeys, describes marked reduction in plasma ApoB protein levels for as long as 11 days after a single i.v. injection (2.5 mg/kg) [85]. Mark Davis\u2019 group formulated siRNAs in cationic cyclodextrin containing polycations (CDPs) that can be equipped with targeting ligands, for example, transferrin for delivery to tumour cells overexpressing the transferrin receptor. The systemic delivery of these targeted siRNA nanoparticles, twice weekly for >4 weeks resulted in long-term inhibition of tumour cell engraftment and tumour growth in a murine therapeutic model for metastatic Ewing's sarcoma [86]. Interestingly, the long-term inhibition was only observed for the formulation where the surface was modified with transferrin moieties and no positive outcome was demonstrated for the non-targeted formulation. This targeted nanoparticle delivery system also has been evaluated recently in non-human primates [87].",

Some reports ascribe a prolonged gene silencing effect in cell cultures to the use of stabilized siRNA duplexes that show higher resistance towards nuclease attack, suggesting that intracellular degradation of siRNA can indeed be partially responsible for transient RNAi gene silencing 88, 89, 90. An interesting recent report by Takabatake et al. demonstrates the dependence of RNAi gene silencing duration on the tissue expression level of eri-1 (enhanced RNAi-1) nuclease [91]. eri-1 can be regarded as a type of siRNAse, which has been discovered in C. elegans mutants [92]. Preliminary experiments in EGFP transgenic rats revealed that a single administration of siEGFP into the kidney resulted in the reduction of EGFP expression for up to two weeks, while the transfection of siEGFP into muscle tissue silenced EGFP for up to 90 days. The authors hypothesize that the higher eri-1 expression level in the kidney when compared with muscle could be responsible for higher intracellular siRNA degradation and decreased RNAi longevity. They propose that blocking eri-1 expression or applying eri-1-resistant siRNAs can result in more sustained gene silencing [91].",

Although partially modified siRNAs did not show increased nuclease resistance compared with wild-type siRNA, the authors did observe enhanced duration in MDR-1 gene silencing, resulting in more durable suppression of p-glycoprotein expression. These data underscore the fact that, at the cellular level, factors other than mere siRNA stability, like cellular uptake and/or recognition by RNAi machinery, have to be taken into account. Liao and Wang reported on 2\u2032-O-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) modifications that serve to enhance siRNA lipophilicity [69]. These chemical adjustments facilitate the intracellular siRNA penetration and improve the siRNA stability that resulted in a stronger inhibition of insulin-like growth factor receptor expression, relative to unmodified siRNA directed against the same target sequence.",

            "text": "Interestingly, it seems that in fast dividing cell lines gene silencing is limited by intracellular dilution of siRNA (and activated RISC) owing to cell division. As a result, in vitro gene silencing usually lasts for only \u223c4\u20137 days [49]. In slowly dividing and non-dividing cells the siRNA stability is supposed to be the main limiting factor for prolonged gene silencing as the intracellular siRNA half-life is expected to be shorter than the cell division time [49]. Intracellular persistence of active siRNA has already been shown to maintain target gene inhibition for several weeks in different types of (non-dividing) primary cells 49, 95, 96, 97, 98. In these papers it was assumed that the stability of the RNAi effect is representative of the physical stability of the intracellular siRNA trigger. Unfortunately, in most reports this assumption was not experimentally evaluated. Song et al., who did perform a Northern blot analysis for siRNA integrity, suggested that intracellular siRNA survival requires the active production of the target mRNA transcript [95]. Also, Maliyekkel et al. reported on more stable gene silencing following transient shRNA induction in growth-arrested non-cycling cells [96]. However, in contrast to other reports on long-lasting RNAi in non-dividing cells [95], the phenotypic RNAi activity did not coincide with the intracellular siRNA decay as analyzed by an RNase protection assay. Two possible explanations for this discrepancy were suggested. Firstly, it is conceivable that the RNAi phenotype is mainly governed by the fraction of siRNA associated with RISC*. As already mentioned previously, it can be expected that incorporation of the guide strand in the RISC* complex provides extra protection against degradation. In this case, quantifying total intracellular siRNA does not represent the effective intracellular RNAi potential. Secondly, it was proposed that transcriptional silencing of the target gene could be held responsible for the increased silencing duration (see below).",

Nonetheless, although the benefits of nuclease-resistant siRNAs inside the cell cytoplasm still remain questionable, chemical modifications have proved to be a very useful approach to abrogate off-target effects and unwanted stimulation of the mammalian immune system 100, 101, 102, 103. Several native siRNA sequences are known to induce a toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated immune response through endosomal TLR7/8 recognition 104, 105. Cytoplasmic receptors such as PKR (dsRNA-binding protein kinase receptor), and the RNA helicases RIG-1 (retinoic acid-inducible gene-I) and MDA-5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5), are considered to recognize certain structural RNA characteristics, other than nucleotide sequence [103]. RIG-1, for instance, is activated by uncapped 5\u2032 triphosphate RNA and blunt-ended siRNAs 103, 106. Mitigation of immune response is possible by designing siRNAs devoid of immunostimulatory sequence motifs and by paying proper attention to dsRNA physical structure. The most robust approach, however, is the selective incorporation of modified nucleotides (e.g. 2\u2032 OMe) to avoid immune receptor activation 103, 107. Kleinman et al. showed recently that 21 nt or longer siRNAs inhibited choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in mice in a sequence-independent and target-independent manner. The inhibition resulted from the cell-surface binding of TLR3 by generic siRNAs [108]. Modifying the siRNA duplex to minimize TLR3 activation could reduce any consequential undesired effect and enhance target specificity. Therefore, chemical modifications can certainly help to optimize siRNA design towards minimal in vivo toxicity and maximal siRNA tolerance.",

Although it was first believed that siRNA only functions in the cell cytoplasm [109], several reports studied three different siRNA functions in the cell nucleus: RNAi [110]; transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) [111] and antigene RNAs (agRNAs) [112]. To obtain an effect at the transcriptional level, the siRNA molecules need to be taken up by the nucleus. The exact mechanism by which siRNAs are transported through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) still needs to be clarified. In principle, siRNA molecules are small enough to diffuse passively through the NPCs to reach the nucleoplasm.",

Prolonging HIV-1 silencing up to 14\u201325 days was achieved using adeno-associated or lentiviral vectors; however, the efficacy of HIV-1 treatment based on a PTGS approach is potentially further limited because HIV-1 is known to adapt to environmental pressure, and rapid selection of siRNA escape mutants has been described in vitro\n[128]. For this reason, Suzuki et al. made use of TGS as another approach to prolong the suppressive effect of siRNA that would be less susceptible to the adaptability of HIV-1 [129]. A prolonged effect can be expected because it has been shown that, regardless of the exact mechanisms, RdDM is long lasting and can be passed on across generations in plant systems 130, 131, 132 and in C. elegans in the absence of the original RNAi trigger [133]. Therefore, epigenetic modifications through the use of promoter-specific siRNAs could be an interesting method of achieving a more robust gene silencing effect, although it has been suggested that this probably needs a constitutive expression of promoter-directed siRNA/shRNA.",

AgRNA treatment was further shown to be dependent on Argonaute-1 (AGO1) and Argonaute-2 (AGO2) activity [136]. Potent inhibition of multiple genes suggests that agRNAs may represent a natural mechanism for controlling transcription, which will be valuable for applications of silencing gene expression.

If the protein half-life extends over several days, even efficient knockdown of intracellular mRNA levels after a single siRNA dose may fail in altering the cellular phenotype owing to residual amounts of the stable protein. The rate of cell division is imperative for the duration of gene silencing in a transient RNAi approach because it determines how transient the RNAi effect really is. In this regard, the targeted cell type and the envisioned therapeutic outcome are of great importance. If a single administration of siRNA is effective in blocking tumour cell growth, this inherently implies a prolonged effect since the intracellular siRNA dilution due to cell division can be disregarded [141].",

However, the regulation of intracellular siRNA concentrations becomes more complex in the case of (non-viral) synthetic siRNA delivery where mostly (electrostatic) complexes between siRNA and (cationic) polymers (polyplexes) or (cationic) lipids (lipoplexes) are applied to the cells. With these polyplexes and lipoplexes a transient RNAi effect lasting for less than one week is generally observed. For many of these formulations, one can expect that upon escape from the endosome, they provide a burst release of siRNA in the cytoplasm. The released siRNA is subsequently prone to dilution through cell division and (possibly) intracellular degradation, leading to a transient gene silencing. In theory, time-controlled release of siRNA in the cell cytoplasm could be interesting to maintain intracellular siRNA concentrations for a longer period of time above the minimal threshold required for efficient gene silencing, without flooding the cell cytoplasm with uncomplexed (naked) siRNAs. Controlling the amount of siRNA that is released in the cytosol could therefore result in a prolonged RNAi effect.",

Our group recently published on cationic biodegradable poly-\u03b2-amino esters (PbAEs) that are able to form nanosized electrostatic complexes with the negatively charged siRNA (Figure 5\n). Following endocytosis of the polyplexes, the hydrolytic degradation of the cationic polymer is believed to increase the osmotic pressure inside the endosomal vesicles owing to an accumulation of its degradation products [148]. When exceeding a crucial pressure threshold, this eventually leads to endosomal rupture. It is hypothesized that the polymer degradation rate and the number of polyplexes residing in a single endosome will govern the kinetics of the rise in osmotic pressure over the endosomal membrane. Therefore, not all endosomes are expected to rupture at the same time. In this way a more gradual siRNA release into the cell cytoplasm is expected in function of polymer degradation, thereby altering gene silencing kinetics (Figure 5).",

To give an example, it was shown for HIV-1 that, in response to a single shRNA inhibitor, mutations inside and even outside the RNAi target sequence provided an escape route for the virus eventually nullifying the antiviral effect [156]. A combinatorial strategy applying multiple shRNAs, expressed from a single lentiviral vector and targeting a different region in the HIV-1 genome, increased the viral inhibitory activity. It seemed that a double expression vector also provided a more durable viral inhibition. Comparable observations are presented in literature for Coxsackievirus B3 [157] and SARS-associated coronavirus, where a clear synergistic antiviral effect was obtained through combination of siRNAs targeting different functional genes in the coronaviral genome [158]. Currently, the concept of coRNAi also includes combining RNAi triggers with non-RNAi-based suppressors of gene expression [159] or even anti-viral proteins [160]. For instance, a multiplex strategy resulting in long-term HIV-1 inhibition in primary cells was reported using a triple combination of an anti-HIV shRNA, a hammerhead ribozyme targeted against the HIV co-receptor chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and a RNA decoy of HIV-TAR [159].",

Nevertheless, RNAi can be regarded as a broad therapeutic platform that can be additionally deployed in other challenging-to-treat human pathologies, such as metabolic disorders and cancer, where a combinatorial approach could be a therapeutic asset in the context of achieving long-term silencing. Recent reports established a synergistic effect of an RNAi trigger especially when combined with conventional low molecular weight chemotherapeutics. Takei et al. employed an effective siRNA against midkine (MK) together with low (and essentially non-toxic) doses of paclitaxel in human prostate cancer xenografts and found that paclitaxel significantly augmented the antitumour effect of MK-siRNA [161]. In this way, tumour growth inhibition could be maintained for several weeks without the need to switch to higher (and most probably toxic) doses of paclitaxel. Unfortunately, the in vivo administration of the siRNA-atelocollagen formulation used in that report was restricted to intratumoural injection. The same synergistic phenomenon, however, was found for an intravenously administrated targeted nanoparticle formulation of anti-EGFR siRNA, in combination with intraperitoneal cisplatin, in a human lung cancer xenograft model. In contrast to monotherapy with targeted nanoparticles containing anti-EGFR siRNA, which only partially reduced tumour growth, the combination of the targeted siRNA-nanoparticles with cisplatin completely inhibited tumour proliferation for \u223c1 week [162]. A third and earlier report describes the packaging of siRNA into neutral liposomal vesicles for the targeting of the tyrosine kinase receptor EphA2 oncogene, which is overexpressed in ovarian cancer. When liposomal anti-EphA2 siRNA was administered in addition to paclitaxel, a significant reduction in tumour growth was observed when compared with paclitaxel in combination with non-silencing siRNA [163]. The same neutral liposomal formulation was applied to target focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and, again, a synergistic effect could be obtained when combining therapeutic siRNA with conventional chemotherapeutics such as docetaxel and cisplatin [164].",

A particular advantage when combining different RNAi effectors (with or without alternative therapeutics) is the maximization of the silencing effect, both acute and long-term. Needless to say that the safety concerns that have been raised for RNAi monotherapy also hold true for coRNAi. Multiplexing several siRNA/shRNA triggers could even augment the risks inherently linked to RNAi, such as off-targeting, immunostimulation and competition with endogenous miRNAs. Following co-administration of different types of RNAi drugs, they can even compete with each other for the (limited) amount of cellular RNAi proteins, thereby diminishing each other's efficacy 55, 165. By contrast, combining RNAi effectors with other non-RNAi-based therapeutics may allow lowering the dosing of both drugs. In this way, coRNAi can still profit from the synergistic effect along with the benefit of reduced toxicity.",

Direct application of synthetic siRNAs has the disadvantage that the RNAi effect is transient, mainly owing to intracellular dilution of active siRNA dependent on the cell division rate. To maintain a sufficient silencing of the target gene expression over a prolonged period of time, different strategies have been proposed. Paying proper attention to their practical implication should eventually lead to a maximal RNAi effect, both in terms of magnitude and duration. siRNA duplexes can be designed and modified to optimally exploit the endogenous RNAi pathway in order to increase their gene silencing potency. Pursuing optimal siRNA design will lead to siRNA drug candidates with lower IC50 values that should enable effective medical treatment at lower doses. Incorporation of chemically modified nucleotides into the siRNA sequence has proven to enhance their half-life in the bloodstream by protecting them against nuclease activity. It is, however, conceivable that the application of naked (i.e. unformulated or non-conjugated) siRNAs will be mainly limited to confined target sites after local administration, such as the eye or the respiratory tract 165, 167, 168.",

The nano revolution led to the development of intelligent nanodevices, which should enable extrapolating drug delivery from the laboratory to a real in vivo situation. Multifunctional delivery vehicles and siRNA conjugation strategies offer many advantages for the systemic application of siRNA because they are usually equipped with targeting ligands and carry stabilizing hydrophilic polymers to avoid aggregation in the bloodstream and prevent non-specific uptake by the reticulo-endothelial cells [169]. Moreover, delivery vehicles are often modified to improve the intracellular trafficking (e.g. endosomal escape) that can lead to increased intracellular bioavailability. Including all these factors in carrier design should enhance the percentage of the administered siRNA dose that reaches the target site after systemic delivery. The ultimate goal is to define the appropriate dosing schedule for a given siRNA formulation to maintain the desired therapeutic outcome. Model predictions can aid in recognizing the main factors that govern the duration of the siRNA effect in order to adjust the siRNA dose and frequency of administration accordingly. This can provide researchers with general meaningful insights on systemic siRNA delivery that may apply to a variety of siRNA carriers.",

RISC only maintains one strand (antisense strand or guide strand) while Ago2, the catalytic unit of RISC, cleaves the passenger strand (sense strand). The siRNA guide strand in active RISC* then recognizes complementary target sites to direct mRNA cleavage, which is again catalyzed by Ago2.
