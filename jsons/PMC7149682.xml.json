A superficial epithelial cell type characterized by large osmiophilic granules is not found in primates.

The lacrimal gland is large, bilobulated, and pale red in color, occupying the orbit adjacent to the lower rim; it is narrow in form with bulbous enlargements at each canthus. The lacrimal gland is a serous-secreting, compound, tubular gland surrounded by a fibrous connective tissue capsule; the lobes are divided into lobules by loose connective tissue septa containing reticular and collagenous elastic fibers. In the rabbit the lacrimal glandplays a lesser role in lubricating the eye than it does in humans, and the effect of removal of the lacrimal gland is diminished by compensatory secretions from the gland of the third eyelid and Harder's gland. Although transient keratoconjunctivitis sicca may be observed following partial removal of the gland, signs disappear, supposedly owing to the regeneration of the tissue.",

The gland is encapsulated and is almost totally surrounded by the orbital venous sinus. The gland is roughly kidney shaped with two distinct lobes, a pink lobe and a white lobe; the size and dispersion of lipid droplets in the gland probably account for the difference in color. The cells of the gland differ in shape as well. In the pink lobe thecells of the acini are cuboidal and filled with lipid droplets which are larger than those in the white lobe. In the white lobe, the acini are formed by columnar epithelium with smaller lipid droplets. The two lobes appear to have similar function, which includes being an integral part of the secretoryimmune system. There is a single duct which opens onto the inferior part of the bulbar surface of thethird eyelid, to which the gland is attached. The gland of the third eyelid closely resembles Harder's gland in structure and is situated surrounding the shaft of the cartilage of the third eyelid. The biochemistry of isolated rabbit lacrimal acini has been described (Bradley et al., 1992).",

The lacrimal bone in the rabbit does not have a well-defined lacrimal fossa although it does support the lacrimal sac medially. The nasolacrimal duct courses through the semicircular lacrimalcanal from the orbit to the maxilla. In the maxilla the duct courses medially and rostrally for 5 to 6 mm; at this point the duct changes diameter abruptly to 1 mm and curves rostrally. The duct maintains a 2 mm diameter until it reaches the incisor tooth root, where it spirals slightly and is compressed in a saggital plane between the alveolar bone of the premaxilla and the nasal cartilage. The duct courses rostrally and medially to the nasal vestibule, where it exits at the nasopunctum several millimeters posterior to the mucocutaneous junction of the alar fold. The nasolacrimal duct of the rabbitis difficult to cannulate as resistance is encountered at the proximal maxillary curve and the base of the incisor tooth (Burling et al., 1991). Histologically the rabbit nasolacrimal duct is similar to the human nasolacrimal duct.",

Injection of 1% kaolin into the anterior chamber obstructs the outflow channels, and IOP reached 50\u201370mm Hg within 14 days (Voronina, 1954). Encircling the globe with constricting threads (Skotnicki, 1957) or bands (Flocks et al., 1959) caused high IOP (70\u2013100 mm Hg) which decreased to 35\u201350 mm Hg within 48 hr; one-third of the eyes in one study developed endophthalmitis (Flocks et al., 1959). Polyethylene tubing threaded into the rabbit iridocorneal angle caused an increase in IOP within 24 hr that remained elevated for 6 months; loss of retinal ganglion cells occurred (Kupfer, 1962; Malik et al., 1970). Intraocular injection of methylcellulose will cause a transient elevation of IOP (Samis, 1962; Kazdan and MacDonald, 1963), whereas injection of cotton fragments induces a more prolonged elevation (deCarvalho, 1962). Injection of 75 units of \u03b1-chymotrypsin into the anterior chamber resulted in a chronic moderate elevation of IOP (up to 50 mm Hg) in 50% of both pigmented and nonpigmented rabbit eyes (Best et al., 1975). Subconjunctival injection of sclerosing agents such as phenol causedlong-term elevation of IOP (Malik et al., 1970; Luntz, 1966). Intracameral injection of autologous fixed red blood cells resulted in a chronic, variable, but dramatic elevation of IOP associated with a hemolytic inflammatory process; optic nerve changes were documented in the model (Peiffer et al., 1991) (Fig. 11\n). Perhaps the model that is most desirable utilized an argon laser to occlude the iridocorneal angle inpigmented rabbits; laser parameters included 200\u2013275 50-\u00b5m spots, 0.1\u20130.2 sec, 1.2\u20131.6 W, and 32.8\u201378 joules of total energy; an IOP elevation of 28\u201350 mm Hg occurredin 50% of treated rabbits (Gherezghiher et al., 1986).",

The relatively labile and less predictable blood\u2013ocular barrier of the rabbit has been mentioned earlier; the rabbit uvea responds to insult with exuberant fibrin exudation. A comparison of response to intravitreal glycosaminoglycans showed the rabbit to have a more severe anterior segment response and a less predictable posterior segment response, compared to the human and monkey (Peiffer, 1991). Thus, both quantitative and qualitative differences in ocular tissue responsiveness make the rabbit less thanan ideal model (Bito, 1984).",

Rabbits have served us well in our understanding of normal ocular form and function and the pathogenesisand management of ophthalmic disease, but likely not optimally. Species variation in the sensitivity and nature of the blood\u2013ocular barriers has been addressed. Differences between breeds and strains and especially between nonpigmented and pigmented eyes have not been elaborated on but warrant consideration. There are demonstrated differences in drug distribution (Barza et al., 1979) and neural pathways (Oyster et al., 1987) between nonpigmented andpigmented eyes; empirical observations with regard to species-specific tissue responsiveness, hypertensive response to corticosteroids, and numerous other experimental conditions have been made. The albino eye is a reasonable model to study parameters in albinos, but the vast majority of humans (to which most modeling is extrapolated) have melanin in the iris, ciliary, and retinal pigment epithelium as well as the uvea. The continued use of the New Zealand White rabbit as a model for ophthalmic and visual experimentation is difficult to rationalize, and the use of pigmented rabbits will result in better scientific studies.",
