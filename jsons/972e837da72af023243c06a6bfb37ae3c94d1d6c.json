            "text": "It is important to consider why the nursing home environment is so conducive to respiratory infection. A prime factor is that nursing homes are a relatively closed environment. That is, residents live in close quarters and have frequent contact (Strausbaugh et al. 2003) . Typically, residents have meals at a common dining area and have activities together. There is a high degree of cognitive impairment among residents of nursing homes, so wandering is common. As a consequence, opportunities for exposure are common. Transmission of respiratory viruses is generally by direct skin-to-skin contact, or by direct contact with mucosal surfaces, or contact with respiratory secretions. Coughing and sneezing can effectively transmit respiratory viruses. Indirect contact through contamination of the environment also plays a role, albeit more limited. The role of staffing is also an important consideration. Generally, staff are assigned to certain units in a nursing homes, but there may be circulation between various floors by some healthcare workers. There are also frequent visitors to nursing homes, all of which serve as entry point for respiratory viruses. Although staff in most facilities are either encouraged or required to be vaccinated against influenza, this is not the case for visitors.",

When the types of outbreaks in nursing homes are systematically reviewed, influenza accounts for the largest number of outbreaks by a single pathogen (Utsumi et al. 2010) . Respiratory viruses circulate throughout the year in nursing homes. Although unusual, even influenza has been reported during the summer in these facilities. Outbreaks of respiratory infection in nursing homes tend to be explosive, with rapid ascension of cases with subsequent decline (Masse et al. 2016) . Generally, the epidemiology of the viruses reflects circulation in the community.",

            "text": "The degree to which respiratory viruses cause primary viral pneumonia among residents of nursing homes is not well understood. Respiratory viruses such as influenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human meta-pneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus are frequently detected as the causative agents of outbreaks in the nursing home settings (Masse et al. 2016; Meijer et al. 2013 ; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2013; Todd Faulks et al. 2000) . It is assumed that the majority of cases of pneumonia in this setting are due to bacterial superinfection. However, it is unclear to what extent serious illness is due to superinfection with bacteria such as pneumococcus since there are no studies that have systematically measured viral infection and subsequent comphrehensive testing for pneumococcus. What is known is that the incidence of invasive disease with pneumococcus among residents of nursing homes is about four times that of age-and sex-matched controls in the community (Kupronis and Richards 2003) . While bacterial superinfection is likely for a certain proportion of cases, the epidemiology of primary viral pneumonia in this population remains uncertain. Although pneumonia is treated empirically in this setting with antibiotics that provide coverage for pneumocococcus, there are few options available for the treatment of respiratory viral infection. In fact, at present, only neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, are available for the treatment of influenza infection (McKimm-Breschkin 2005; Gori\u0161ek Miksi\u0107 et al. 2015; Monto et al. 2004) .",

This is likely because of the number of challenges of doing such clinical studies in nursing home residents. First, informed consent is required, and this often is obtained from substitute decision makers, namely family members, because of the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in this population. Secondly, the timing of obtaining and processing PBMCs is difficult. Thirdly sufficient resources are required both for research nurses and laboratory technologists and reagents. To date, there is only one study which overcame these challenges to generate immune biomarker data and is described below.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained after vaccination against influenza in a cohort of 1,072 residents. These specimens were then tested by flow cytometry for CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell subsets (CCR7 + CD45RA+, CCR7-CD45RA+ and CD28-CD57+) as well as T-regs and CMV-reactive CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells. The concept was to use these baseline markers as predictor variables in statistical models to determine which markers predicted respiratory viral infection. Prospective surveillance was then conducted and the incidence of viral respiratory viruses was determined. A time to event analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between immune phenotypes and time to symptomatic viral infection. Of a total of 1165 residents enrolled, 1087 (93%) had PBMCs obtained. The median age of this population was 86 years and about half scored with 7 or 8 on the Clinical Frailty Scale, which represents severe frailty (Rockwood et al. 2007 ). There were 87 residents who had laboratory confirmed viral respiratory illness, with corona, influenza, rhinovirus, and RSV being the most common viral pathogens. In multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, and frailty, only high T-reg% (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.81) and high CMV-reactive CD4+ T cell% (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03-2.78) were predictive of respiratory viral infection. Notably, CD8+ T cells were not found to be predictive of respiratory viral infection in the nursing home population.",

The Canadian study described above focused on the T cell response to CMV and observed that elevated frequencies of CMV-reactive CD4+ T cells, but not CMV-reactive CD8+ T cells, were associated with an increased risk of respiratory viral infection.

The chapter provided the reader with an overview of the nursing home environment, highlighting the epidemic nature of respiratory infection in this setting. An overview of biomarkers associated with respiratory viral infections was provided. The nature of this environment also makes it difficult to conduct large-scale epidemiological studies. One of the most difficult is enrollment. That is, because the majority of nursing home residents have some degree of cognitive impairment and therefore cannot consent, family members need to be approached. Unfortunately, they often are hard to reach and have little interest in providing consent. Another challenge is that because of confidentiality concerns, the nursing home must first obtain permission from residents' families for the research nurse to approach them. While well intentioned, this also serves as a barrier for recruitment.",

            "text": "Despite these challenges, the nursing home setting is an important one to do research in. The residents of nursing homes are often quite aged, typically frail, and have multiple comorbidities. This offers an important opportunity to evaluate the role of waning immune system in comparison to or when controlled for by age and comorbidity. While it is important to continue to assess immunological difference between younger and older populations, it is important to test the effect of these differences using particular phenotypes. Only by assessing the impact of the immunological differences on clinical outcomes can the relevance of this field of research be made clear. Another challenge of conducting research in this area is identifying the appropriate journals for publication. It is unfortunate that clinical journals fail to grasp the value of including immunologic parameters as risk factors as they do not see this as clinically relevant. Journals that accept more fundamental work generally prefer to accept studies in mice before population-based studies in humans. In both of these cases, this is due to lack of familiarity with the methods, in the first immunological parameters and in the second epidemiologic design and interpretation.",

One reason perhaps is that it is much more difficult to assess residents of nursing homes and to plan studies. The deficits described in the nursing home population highlight the importance of reduced CD8+ na\u00efve T cells, the increase in CD8+ terminally differentiated cells, the increase in CD4+ T cells, and the increase in mature NK cells. Evidence of the importance of CD4+ T cells, in particular T-regs and CMV-reactive CD4+ T cells, as a predictor of viral respiratory infection was reviewed. It will be important for investigators to investigate more nursing home cohorts in order to confirm and replicate findings presented by investigators that were reviewed in this chapter. There have been no large-scale epidemiologic studies assessing immune phenotype and influenza vaccine response. This is an important area to investigate given the poor performance of vaccines in this population. Despite new formulations of influenza vaccines, including adjuvant vaccines, increase in hemaglutinin dose, and intradermal vaccines, knowledge about response in large populations is lacking. Investigators conducting clinical trials of influenza vaccine in this population should consider adding blood collection for PBMCs in order to assess biomarkers associated with a robust or poor response. Interaction terms to assess the impact of the presence or absence of the biomarkers should be assessed.",
