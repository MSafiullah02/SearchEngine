This approach isn\u2019t only used in teaching but also, for the most part, in medical specialization. Cats throw a wrench into this approach. They commonly exhibit comorbidities extending beyond 1 organ (eg, triaditis, chronic kidney disease with hyperthyroidism, diabetes with arthritis). In a way, this isn\u2019t surprising as the body functions in an integrative manner. Inflammation on 1 body system may be reflected elsewhere as well. But might this \u201cholistic\u201d approach extend further? Cats are restrained and understated: it is easy to miss that they are uncomfortable or unhappy. Caregivers may not notice sickness until their cat is exhibiting clinical signs, such as vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, rather than more subtle changes. And poor health may, in fact, be a physical manifestation of nonphysical problems, or disease.",

To a great degree, bodies are designed to heal when basic needs (hydration, nutrition, analgesia, and environmental and social) are met. As practitioners (and researchers), it is important to remember the basic tenet of medicine: \u201cIf you can do no good, at least do no harm.\u201d It is imperative not to add the challenges of stress/fear, pain/discomfort, unpalatable, unappetizing food, or unnecessary medications to the mix. The idea for this 2-issue issue of Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice is to highlight not only exciting medical advances but also clinically relevant understanding of the effects of mental, emotional, and social factors on health, disease, and illness.",
