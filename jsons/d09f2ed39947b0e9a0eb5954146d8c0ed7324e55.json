The first hugely contentious issue facing the Apps is the deployment framework, i.e. centralised or decentralised. Based on this, the debate branches out to the corresponding technologies that underpin these architectures, i.e. GPS, QR codes, and Bluetooth. This work conducts a pioneering review of the above scenarios and contributes a geolocation mapping of the current deployment. The Apps' vulnerabilities and the directions of research are identified, with a special focus on the Bluetooth-inspired decentralised paradigm.",

These Apps mainly follow the PEPP-PT (Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing) [18] protocol, but the consensus amongst the technical community is that this framework is too academic for practical development. For the decentralized approach, the personal data is enclosed or controlled by individuals only on personal devices. These Apps follow the DP-3T (Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing) [19] data protection solution recently developed by the European Academics. However, this framework is only partially decentralised, i.e. there is an anonymous centralised database for only the infected people. Google and Apple in partnership [20] will launch an exclusive decentralised framework in May which will be more compatible with the Android and iOS systems. Regarding the technologies and infrastructures that underpin the two architectures, GPS is based on crowd mapping for tracking the spread of the COVID-19, while the QR codes scanning approach is combined with physical temperature testing equipment or thermal imaging cameras to track the healthy or infected individuals' movement on public transport. The Bluetooth method detects other devices retained for a certain amount of time within a certain range of distance, and notifies the devices which have had sufficient contacts with the infected individual's device, assuming that the infected individuals report their anonymous infection states to the App. Researchers from Oxford [21] recently modelled and proposed a threshold on the active user rates (at least 60%) for the App to fully deliver its valuable insights for the government to contain the virus. There is arguably a growing trend globally and especially in Europe that the decentralised architecture would be preferable.",

(4) The NHS CV19 App (Bluetooth based) to be deployed by the UK NHS is struggling to address false positives and negatives, especially for the situation if people who have symptom but do not report in the App. There is a rising concern about the App's downloading rates among the whole country, as evidenced in the first launch in the Isle of Wight, with a limited coverage up to 24% of the residents. (5) The Healthy Together (GPS based, centralised) used by the State of Utah (US), and the Care19 (GPS based, centralised) employed by the North and South Dakota (US) are both vulnerable to flaws in the centralised data pool protection and the sensitive GPS location data issues.
