In this review, we outline the risk and benefits of primary PCI vs. thrombolysis for STEMI. While thrombolysis may seem like a good choice, many patients have a contraindication and could end-up using more resources. Also, with a high probability of the angiogram showing non-obstructed coronary arteries during acute infections, primary PCI should be the preferred strategy.

In addition, most health-care facilities in the United States have canceled elective surgeries, limited visitors, and transitioned ambulatory clinic visits to televisits to help limit the community spread and to \"flatten the curve.\" In this crisis situation, optimal management of acute cardiac conditions such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is challenging.",

Recently, cardiologists all over the world have seen a decrease of STEMI patients during this pandemic [3] . In addition, once the patient does present, there may also be delay due to the infection-control measures employed by EMS, ED, and catherization lab personnel to prevent the spread of the infection to themselves and other patients. A recent analysis by Tam et al. [4] at a STEMI center in Hong Kong, China, showed that patients presenting with STEMI have a delay in all three important aspects of care (symptom onset to first medical contact, door to device, and catheterization lab arrival to device). The duration for all of these components of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f STEMI care was higher than regular on/off hours. Their analysis demonstrated that well-built systems of care for STEMI management can easily be disrupted during this pandemic.",

Also, the CT scan can be evaluated for three major classic features of COVID-19: ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f bilateral pulmonary infiltration with reticular patterns. Point-of-care ultrasound, rather than the standard transthoracic echocardiogram, can be used to evaluate for a new wall-motion abnormality, as there is a risk of exposing the cardiac sonographer to COVID-19.

The authors also recommended that the risk of spreading the infection vs. the benefit of performing PCI should be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f carefully evaluated, and in unstable patients, conservative treatment should be followed until the resolution of pneumonia.

If a patient is COVID-19 negative, standard treatment as per the guidelines should be followed.

Only patients with symptom onset of less than 12 hours should be evaluated for either thrombolytics or primary PCI. If a patient presents to a COVID-19-trained and PCI-capable facility, primary PCI should be performed. All the infection precaution steps should be followed by the team, and every effort should be made to achieve ideal door-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to-balloon times. If a patient presents to a non-COVID-19-trained lab or a non-PCI-capable hospital and the transfer to a COVID-19-trained/PCI-capable facility can happen within 120 minutes, it should be initiated. However, if the transfer cannot happen within 120 minutes, thrombolysis should be performed, and concomitant medical management with aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, or enoxaparin should be followed, as per the guidelines [9, 10] . Before thrombolysis is administered, acute coronary syndrome mimics should be ruled out by careful evaluation of the EKG to rule out myopericarditis, and point-ofcare ultrasound should be used to evaluate for new wall-motion abnormality. Signs of delayed myocardial enhancement on cardiac CT acquired after the iodinated contrast can be helpful [25, 26] , and this can be considered in facilities with no cardiac MRI.
