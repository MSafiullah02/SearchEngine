In those patients requiring dialysis for renal failure, dalteparin was not administered. If renal function subsequently improved, then dalteparin administration was recommenced.

A recent randomized prospective trial has suggested that ursodeoxycholic acid administration postallogeneic HSCT decreases the incidence of hepatic complications.18 This benefit, however, appears to be because of a reduction in the incidence of acute GVHD and nonrelapse mortality and not because of a reduction in the incidence of VOD.18 Therefore, its specific role in VOD prophylaxis may be limited.",

UH administration appeared to be efficacious with a reduction in the incidence of VOD from 13.7% in the patients receiving no prophylaxis to 2.5% in the patients receiving UH, without an increase in bleeding episodes. This trial has been criticized, however, for the small number of patients (11%) at high risk of VOD before commencing HDCT, none of whom developed VOD irrespective of whether they received heparin or not. Therefore, despite the apparent overall positive results of the Attal trial, the role of UH remains controversial and the majority of subsequent studies examining the role of UH in VOD prophylaxis have not shown a clear benefit for UH.13,21",

All of these qualities potentially make LMWH an attractive anticoagulant agent in the hematopoietic stem cell transplant setting where the majority of patients experience a variable period of thrombocytopenia and increased risk of bleeding.",

Only three of 40 (7.5%) patients developed significant bleeding requiring transfusion of PRBCs and 24 (60%) patients developed minor mucosal bleeding or petechiae. No patients died of hemorrhage or suffered any permanent sequelae because of bleeding. These results are in keeping with the 7\u201323% incidence of serious bleeding reported in the literature for patients undergoing HDCT and HSCT irrespective of whether they are receiving low doses of systemic anticoagulants.20,31,32 In the pilot study reported by Bearman et al comparing the incidence of VOD and severity of bleeding between a cohort of patients receiving low-dose UH and a control group of patients, the incidence of major bleeding in those patients receiving UH was 7% and all but one patient displayed evidence of minor bleeding.20 The site and severity of bleeding, however, was not statistically different between the UH and control groups. Similarly, in the study reported by Or et al31 where patients undergoing HSCT were randomized between LMWH and placebo, the incidence and duration of bleeding was in fact lower in those patients receiving LMWH. This would support the fact that patients undergoing HDCT and HSCT are at an inherent risk of bleeding because of the development of obligate thrombocytopenia and damaged mucosal surfaces. The administration of low-dose UH or LMWH does not appear to further increase the risk of serious hemorrhage in this patient population and the need for maintaining higher platelet transfusion thresholds in those patients receiving low-dose systemic anticoagulants does not appear to be warranted.",

The small number of patients, the lack of randomization and risk stratification made a determination of efficacy difficult. Despite these limitations, the incidence of VOD in our study was 22% and only one patient developed severe VOD. These results are encouraging when compared to the 20\u201350% reported incidence rates from large published studies where no specific VOD prophylaxis was utilized.2,3,6 Three of the 18 patients (17%) undergoing autologous HSCT is this study developed moderate VOD. While this incidence is higher than what is commonly reported in the literature for this patient population, our results may have been affected by the small number of patients undergoing autologous HSCT, in addition to specific patient characteristics, which may influence the incidence of VOD within individual studies. Finally, the diagnosis of mild\u2013moderate VOD, accounting for eight of the nine patients in our study, can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from other causes of mild hepatic dysfunction such as infection, GVHD and various medications, and this may lead to an overestimate of the true incidence of VOD in this patient population.7,8",
