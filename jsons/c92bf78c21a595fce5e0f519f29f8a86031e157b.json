If air filter is allowed to use forever, particles will penetrate through the air filter and reach the leeward side of air filter, which is of course not permitted. Usually there is one restriction. In the early times, the dust weight deposited on air filter is called the dust holding capacity of this air filter, when the final pressure drop of air filter at operation is about two times of the initial pressure drop. It can be expressed as Practice has shown that the larger the final pressure drop selected is, the larger the variation of the flow rate will be (the flow rate will be reduced by more than 50%). For the application where the flow rate should be kept constant, it is difficult to adjust the flow rate. Meanwhile, the energy consumption will be increased too much, which is not cost-effective. And pollution may also be caused (when the quality of air filter is not good, leakage or penetration is likely to occur by the increased pressure drop across the air filter. The gap inside the equipment may also increase the risk of leakage).",

One key statement is that, at present, there is only significant evidence of health benefits for porous media particle filtration systems. For a few other technologies, there is evidence to suggest health benefits, but this evidence is not sufficient to formulate firm conclusions. A key position is that filtration and air-cleaning technologies are not recommended for use if they produce significant amounts of contaminants that are known or expected to be harmful for health.",

Coarse of fine air filter must be installed at the entrance, whose resistance at nominal flow rate could reach 50 Pa according to standard specification. In order to prevent the leakage of UV rays and particles, air filters with higher efficiency are usually placed at the exit of the UV germicidal irradiation unit. In one product, even HEPA filter is added. For safety reason, air filter or even HEAP filter is set at both the entrance and the exit. Table 4 .6 shows the pressure drops of several electrostatic purifiers by Mao [9] . When W-type air filter was added downstream, the pressure drop was very high. Therefore, it is incorrect in the generally speaking that the pressure drop of electrostatic purifier or UVGI unit is less than fibrous air filter. The pressure drop of the whole unit should be used for comparison. With the improvement of structure, the pressure drop of the fibrous air filter can be reduced greatly. Table 4 .7 shows the pressure drop of ultra-low resistance and high-medium efficiency air filter invented by author, which has particle removing efficiency 85% (\u22650.5 \u00b5m) and bacterial removal efficiency more than 99%.
