Over the years, diagnostic and clinical assessment criteria have undergone multiple iterations and adaptations (Kanner 1943; Verhoeff 2013; Wolff 2004) . Autistic individuals also share commonalities including challenges in communication, social reciprocity, and behavior. Such challenges have not sufficiently been assessed throughout the life span, and little is known about how the aging process interacts with these challenges nor how autistic adults navigate and/or cope or struggle with the aging process. Such challenges likely impact overall impact experience, well-being, autonomy, life skills, and much more. Further, many autistic individuals grapple with co-occurring medical and behavioral health conditions (Ghaziuddin et al. 2002; Schiff and Asato 2015; Underwood et al. 2019) ; thus, inviting further focused study on autism and aging.",

In contrast, for the general population, the fields of gerontology and geriatrics have received substantial attention, with studies and initiatives underway that may shed insight onto the aging process from the biologic, neuroscience, social science, and health service prospective (Freitas et al. 2002) . Similar efforts focused on individuals on the autism spectrum will likely provide insights into providing life-long support as well as offering guidance for public policy.

Although our knowledge of the prevalence of autism in adulthood is limited, a United Kingdom study by Brugha et al. (2009) estimated the prevalence to be ~ 1%. However, Spencer et al. (2011) noted the potential for underestimation since \"individuals with less severe disorders often go undiagnosed\" (p. 891). Some autistic persons may be misdiagnosed and given a psychiatric diagnosis (Luciano et al. 2014 ). Volkmar and Pauls (2003) have estimated that approximately 15% of individuals on the spectrum may obtain self-sufficiency in adulthood, with an additional 15-20% able to accomplish some level of self-sufficiency with some support. Those diagnosed later in life may have milder symptoms and higher levels of functionality (Jones et al. 2014 ). In addition, some individuals diagnosed later in life have learned to adapt to their physical and social challenges and hence, their diagnosis may be 'masked'. However, although undiagnosed, many of these individuals may still experience a range of autism-related and ancillary features (Griffith et al. 2012) . Unfortunately, there are as yet few validated and reliable assessments designed specifically to diagnose autism in adults (Wigham et al. 2019) , and no diagnostic measures directed toward autistic seniors. Many adults and seniors on the autism spectrum have been and continue to be misdiagnosed and consequently are under-served (Au-Yeung et al. 2018). Misdiagnoses and under-diagnoses may be the result of healthcare systems in which providers are not sufficiently trained to recognize the communication, behavioral and sensory challenges as well as the medical needs and social/emotional needs faced by autistic adults. With the growing population of individuals in (and moving toward) these age-related categories, a validated assessment specifically directed to the accurate diagnosis of autistic seniors is increasingly needed in order to delineate daily and medical needs and to provide individuals access to needed and appropriate services.",

Medical conditions may also be associated with behaviors of concern, such as head banging due to migraine headaches or ear infections. Disruptive and aggressive behaviors can also be associated with pain, most especially in those who are non-verbal or hypo-verbal and who cannot express or physically indicate the presence and location of their discomfort (e.g., De Lissovoy 1962, Durand and Moskowitz 2016, Mahler 2017) . Other behaviors such as eye poking has been reported to be associated with calcium deficiency (Coleman 1994) . Further complicating the diagnosis of associated medical conditions is the fact that individuals may not present with symptoms typically recognized by health care providers or specialists, and may therefore be missed. More research is needed regarding the role of co-occurring medical conditions in autism, including their symptomatic presentations and behavioral manifestations, how these medical conditions and symptomatic features may change with age, and how they can be accurately identified and effectively treated. We also need to learn more about specific health conditions associated with aging, such as arthritis, cancer, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, stroke, and dementia; and how these conditions manifest in autistic individuals. In addition, we need to know how autistic individuals respond to standard therapies commonly used to treat these conditions and if different, what therapeutic approaches would prove most effective in this population.",

For all autistic adults, concern was raised about the possibility of receiving less support from their relatives over time. In addition, autistic attendees stressed the need for their gender identity and sexuality to be acknowledged and respected throughout their life. And finally, they noted that people, in general, should be sensitive when talking about the individual's future lifestyle, and avoid raising troubling and potentially erroneous predictions. Accordingly, hope is important and not to be diminished or deposed. Individual resilience amidst challenge which is so often demonstrated by autistic people, should not be dismissed in overly-negative accounts or predictions. Proactively addressing real issues and risk is certainly recommended, but in a strengths and hopeful ethos.",

Additional possible research recruitment mechanisms could include working collaboratively with support networks that have access to adults on the spectrum (Hass et al. 2016) . Nicolaidis et al.

Given the proportionally small number of currently identified autistic adults over 50 years of age relative to younger cohorts, it was recommended that research groups worldwide combine their data to increase overall sample sizes and work collaboratively to optimize comparison controls with the aim of yielding statistically significant outcomes. The development of research collaborations will increase the likelihood of obtaining impactful population-based results in a relatively short period of time, yet attention to cultural variation across international sites may be an important methodologic and interpretive consideration.",
