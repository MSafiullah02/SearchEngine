Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales and they are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. They have the zoonotic origin and they are distributed broadly among humans and other animals like mammals and birds, which cause respiratory, hepatic, enteric, and neurologic diseases [13] . Two fatal coronaviruses emerged periodically in the world in 2002 and 2012. The first one was severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) and the second one was Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [12] .On 10 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified the unknown pathogen as a novel coronavirus denoted as Covid-19 or 2019-nCoV. On 19 February the first case was reported in Iran [14] . The patient was found in the Kamkar-Arabnia Hospital of Qom, a city located near Tehran [2] . Currently, Tehran, Qom, and Mazandaran have the highest number of patients in Iran and are in critical condition. However, no city has been quarantined in Iran and this has led to an increasing number of patients every day. As of 7 March 2020, there were 101,927 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection, including 3486 deaths, reported in all of the world. In the eastern and Mediterranean region, Iran with 4747 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection and 124 deaths, is in the critical stage [15] .",

On January 2, 2020, Huang et al. [5] , first reported clinical features of 41 patients confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV. The characteristics of Covid-19 infected patients in hospitals of Tehran, Iran are approximately the same as all of the world. New symptoms previously not known yet in the world has not seen in Iranian patient until now. With the rise of cases worldwide, the symptoms of the disease have been better characterized. The symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia or fatigue, sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea are initial Covid-19 symptoms. The most common symptoms are onset fever, generalized weakness, and dry cough. Some patients have headache and/or myalgia, but upper respiratory symptoms such as runny nose are rare [16] . Some cases have Diarrhea, which had been reported 10.6% in SARS and up to 30% in MERS [1] . Most of the patients have shortness of breath. If the disease could not be controlled, they might develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), followed by septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction [16] .",

In severe disease, the D-dimer level is higher and lymphocyte decrease progressively and the cytokine storm such as IL1B, IL1RA, IL7, IL8 can be associated with disease severity [5, 1] . On chest CT scans, the multifocal ground glass changes are typical of viral pneumonia. If the disease continued to develop and in the bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation would be found on chest CT scan. The lungs of elderly patients showed more diffuse and extensive imaging than those of the younger patients [5, 1] . In Iran, the government has stated that they can perform three coronary tests per day, which are critical to screening for coronavirus. These tests are appropriate in the early days of the disease. But as the number of patients progresses, more tests will need to be done [2] .",
