An important property of lipid rafts is that they preferentially include or exclude particular proteins to a variable extent. Two major transmembrane glycoproteins in influenza viruses, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are raft-associated proteins [4]. Also, the lipid bilayer of HIV-1 virus contains GPI-linked proteins and ganglioside GM1, both of which are known to partition preferentially into lipid rafts [6]. Conversely, the non-raft protein CD45 is excluded from the lipid bilayer of HIV-1 viruses [6]. Other studies have shown that the HIV-1 Gag and Env proteins are raft-associated proteins [6], [7], [8], [9].",

Cholesterol supplementation was shown to increase the percentage of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase associated with lipid rafts in MDCK cells infected with influenza A virus [12]. Cholesterol depletion can disrupt lipid rafts and abrogates the association of raft-associated proteins [13], [14]. Disruption of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion hinders HIV-1 particle production from virus-producing cells, and cholesterol depletion from virus particles significantly impairs virus infectivity [8]. Depletion of cholesterol from target cells impairs HIV-1 virus infection by decreasing the mobility of HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 on the cell surface [15]. Other investigators have found that disruption of lipid rafts also decreases production of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped, pantropic Molony murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) vector [16].",

For example, cholesterol supplementation can increase the susceptibility of target cells to infection by the enveloped coronavirus murine hepatitis virus [17] and by human adenovirus [18]. Similarly, addition of cholesterol during liposome transfection increases the overall efficiency of non-viral gene delivery [19]. The benefit might be due to the impact of cholesterol on cell membrane fluidity. Cholesterol addition can result in a compensatory increase in the fraction of polyunsaturated fatty acids in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine to control the membrane fluidity [20].",

The supernatant was treated with or without 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 \u00b0C and the cell lysates were loaded on a discontinuous sucrose gradient solution. After centrifugation, lipid rafts and associated Gag protein floated to the top fractions of the gradient (Fig. 2\n), which also contained the majority of the well-known lipid raft-associated protein calveolin (data not shown). Lipid rafts float to the top of the gradient because they are detergent-resistant microdomains (DRM) [8]. Combined with the fact that rafts typically constitute less than 40% of the cell membrane [30], these results suggest colocalization of rafts and MoMuLV Gag in 293-gag-pol cells. As expected, the association of Gag with DRM was disrupted by treatment with Triton X-100 at 37 \u00b0C and most of the Gag protein was found in the bottom fractions (7\u20139) of the gradient (Fig. 2A).",

There was no benefit or a slight decrease for either treatment, while viral vectors produced with cholesterol supplementation yielded about a 2-fold increase in transduction efficiency (Fig. 4\n).

The cholesterol content in the producer cells increased directly as a consequence of cholesterol supplementation (Fig. 9). Viral vectors produced with cholesterol supplementation had higher infectivity compared to those without cholesterol addition (Fig. 3). Although depletion of cholesterol from virus-producing cells could disrupt lipid rafts, hinder viral particle production and decrease virus infectivity [5], [8], the cholesterol amount in producer cells without cholesterol supplementation did not decrease during vector production (Fig. 9). Thus, the supplemented cholesterol did not act by restoring its deficiency in producer cells. Rather, the increased cholesterol content increased the infectivity of vectors that were assembled and budded from rafts, possibly by altering cellular lipid raft composition. Consequently, it is also possible that the lipid composition of the vial vectors was changed similar to that observed by Beer et al. [21], [22], and that this led to changes in viral vector membrane fluidity. It is known that lipid fatty acid composition tends to change to offset the associated change in membrane fluidity under certain circumstances such as low temperature [33]. In this case, increased cholesterol content might trigger a change in membrane fatty acid composition. It has been reported that the level of polyunsaturated species of the major cell membrane phospholipids increased with the incorporation of cholesterol as an adaptive mechanism to control the membrane fluidity [20]. This is consistent with a decrease in the saturated fatty acid (16:0) content in the major phospholipid (PC) with cholesterol supplementation in our study (data not shown). Another possible mechanism is that, by altering cellular lipid raft composition, a greater fraction of vector particles contained viral RNA during assembly and budding. If this were true, a higher percentage of viral vectors produced with cholesterol supplementation would become infectious compared to those without cholesterol addition.",
