Health care resource reallocation at this time includes restricting access to all but the most essential ambulatory visits by shifting this to virtual visits for most ongoing primary and specialty care.4, 5, 6 Multiple guidelines have emerged from international societies on the management of care during COVID-19, including a North American guideline on contingency planning for allergy and immunology clinics during a pandemic and a Canadian Pediatric Society statement on asthma management during COVID-19.7\n,\n8\n",

In our specialty, a salient and poignant example is the recent shortage of metered-dose inhaler asthma quick-relief medications (eg, albuterol/salbutamol) all over the world including Canada, the United States, and Australia, given the high risk of nebulized versions of these medications increasing the risk of viral aerosolization and infection transmission.8\n,\n14, 15, 16 Multiple countries have been required to place restrictions on prescription medications such as bronchodilators (as well as antimalarial and certain antibiotics) due to \u201choarding\u201d and in an attempt \u201cto control stockpiling by customers.\u201d15\n,\n17 An Australian news article from March 25, 2020, highlights the concern of patients with asthma in Australia who have run out of their albuterol supply, noting this to be \u201cendangering the lives of people with chronic illnesses\u201d such as our patients with allergy.17\n",
