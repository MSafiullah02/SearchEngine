Serum antibodies are also polyclonal and frequently polyspecific, even when purified over an antigen column, rendering them suboptimal for the specific recognition of a single component in a complex matrix. One illuminating study (2) has demonstrated that when used to probe a comprehensive yeast proteome chip, unpurified polyclonal antibody preparations could recognize up to 1,770 different proteins, with some monoclonal antibodies and antigen-column purified polyclonal antibodies also recognizing multiple proteins (related and unrelated).",

            "text": "The arrival of monoclonal antibody technology (3) was a major step forward in generating high-specificity reagents, but the reliance on the murine immunoglobulin system frequently leads to a number of practical difficulties: (1) Monoclonal antibodies are raised on the basis of an inefficient fusion of splenic B-cells to an immortalized mouse myeloma line, followed by limiting dilution of the cell population. Target-specific antibodies are randomly identified, often by a simple direct ELISA, where few preconditions can be set to determine which antibodies are identified and one must \u201ctake what one can get\u201d during the screening process. (2) It is often desirable to have multiple monoclonal antibodies with specificity for different epitopes on the same \u00adtarget molecule, but the difficulty in sequencing monoclonals does not allow the rapid identification of unique clones early in the screening process. (3) Humans and rodents are relatively closely related phylogenetically. Many proteins of interest are highly conserved among mammals and this can frequently lead to thymic tolerance restricting the antibody response after immunization. (4) When an immune response to a human protein is raised in mice, the large regions of sequence similarity between murine and human proteins may lead to a restricted number of immunogenic epitopes. (5) To generate antibodies that cross-react with homologs from multiple species of mammal is particularly tricky, as the common epitopes among mammals are the very ones that are unlikely to provoke a strong immunoglobulin response in the mouse. (6) Tolerance issues can become even harder to circumvent when the protein of interest is from a mouse or rat. Creating \u201cknockout\u201d mice, in which the endogenous copy of the gene for the target protein has been disabled, can often break tolerance, but this is a highly laborious and time-consuming process that few laboratories have the resources to undertake. These factors all hinder the generation of high-quality antibody reagents and thereby limit one\u2019s experimental options when developing antibodies for purifying or tracking novel proteins.",

The simplest and most commonly used fragment is the single-chain fragment variable (scFv) where a flexible peptide sequence links the V-regions of antibodies between the C terminus of one domain and the N terminus of the other, thereby combining both V-domains into a single polypeptide (15). The scFv may be assembled in VL\u2013VH or VH\u2013VL orientations, with VH\u2013VL being the most heavily used format historically. The flexible linker helps to make the scFv simple to express, but must be sufficiently long and flexible to allow effective association of the V-regions to form a functional antigen-combining site. As long as this is true, the classical hydrophobic pairing of the V-regions will stabilize the structure. By far the most common linkers are based on glycine\u2013serine repeat structures such as GGGGS \u00d7 3.",

Unfortunately, these forays into display technologies have often left investigators somewhat disappointed. Many people have accepted the viewpoints of recombinant antibody technology experts that these libraries can yield useful high-affinity antibodies to any form of antigen. In general (mostly to those highly skilled in the field), this is indeed true, but the average antibody generated from these libraries is often of disappointingly low affinity to those who are used to high-sensitivity antibodies from immunized sources. Human recombinant antibodies from na\u00efve library sources can require technically challenging in vitro molecular evolution, if they are to perform the demanding \u201creal world\u201d functions required of many reagent antibodies (8). Molecular evolution is far from trivial to perform and is usually beyond both the scope and interest level of the average researcher. Small wonder then that most people either ignore, or at worst disparage, phage display technology itself.",

While the most successful na\u00efve antibody libraries contain over 1010 members and are often the domain of biotechnology companies, typical immune libraries are in the 107\u2013108 range and are easily assembled by a single investigator (18, 19). When an immunized rabbit or sheep has raised a significant serum immunoglobulin titer, the common endpoint to the experiment is to exsanguinate the animal and harvest the serum. However, harvesting B-cell-rich lymphoid tissues from the animal, such as the spleen and bone marrow, allows the isolation of total RNA and the subsequent generation of cDNA (18). This is a simple method with which many biomedical researchers are familiar, and commercial kits are available to simplify most steps of the process.",

This germ-line V-gene system means that the entire chicken antibody repertoire can be captured using only four PCR primers (42), making chicken libraries highly representative of the induced immunoglobulin response. This is in direct contrast with immune hosts such as mice, which have diverse germ-line V-gene sequences and therefore require complex mixes of PCR primers (18). Additionally, the two V-gene germ-line sequences found in chickens are highly homologous to the human V\u03bb and VH3 germ-line families (43), which are both associated with creating V-domains with high stability and solubility. Indeed, chicken scFvs can be stable in crude bacterial culture supernatants for up to 1 month at room temperature (44).",

However, none of these early studies characterized the antibodies for their affinity or their function as practical reagents. More recent studies have shown that scFv antibodies derived from immunized chickens are highly effective reagents in diverse settings such as diagnostic ELISA for Infectious Bural Disease Virus (46), the diagnosis of prion disease (47), immunodetection of haptenic shellfish toxins (48), immunostaining of SARS-infected cells (49), biosensing of cardiac biomarkers (50), and the measurement of ApoB protein in mouse and human sera (51). Raats et al. (52) have also illustrated that anti-idiotype scFvs from an immune chicken scFv library were of considerably higher sensitivity than those derived from a human antibody library in the same study. The generation of highly selective scFvs towards the PrP protein, which is highly conserved in mammals, further demonstrates the advantage of the chicken as an immune model, as isolated scFvs were shown to react with murine, ovine, and bovine orthologs of the protein (47).",

The target proteins of interest are mixed in a single adjuvant preparation and each immunized animal receives all proteins simultaneously. Spleen and bone marrow tissues from the immunized animals are then used to generate relatively small phage display libraries and specific antibodies are derived via selection of the library separately on the individual proteins originally used for immunization (31). The immunized chickens appear to react to the proteins fully independently, as the phage display libraries generate individual scFv antibody clones that are fully specific by western blot and ELISA, showing no reactivity to their co-immunogens (31, 54). This approach has major benefits practically and ethically, as it allows the use of a single library to derive high affinity antibodies to a group of proteins of interest. Multi-immunization methods also simultaneously minimize animal use and raise the likelihood of success in generating an immediately useful reagent (31, 54).",

First, the simplest scenario combines multiple unrelated proteins, which leads to unrelated B-cell responses after immunization. To derive antibodies of greatest specificity during a multitarget immunization of this kind, it is important to ensure that each of the protein immunogens is highly purified and that no closely related proteins are co-immunized into a single animal. Secondly, to derive antibodies that are cross-reactive to orthologs of a conserved protein from multiple species, it is likely to be beneficial, but not necessarily essential, to include each ortholog in the mix of immunogens given to each animal. Iterative selection rounds that change ortholog each time can then be used to bias toward the isolation of cross-reactive antibodies.",

The level of further downstream analysis carried out on positive hits identified during the binding ELISA depends on what the end user requires. Specific binding function may suffice for scFvs that are to be used simply as reagent antibodies for in vitro analysis of samples via ELISA or western blotting.

A similar method was proven to be efficient in the production of Fabs that are specifically biotinylated in vivo during bacterial expression, via C-terminal fusion of the Fabs to the E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase (60). Importantly, these biotinylated Fabs were successfully used to purify recombinant TNF-alpha from bacterial lysates, via a streptavidinated column.

These thiol groups can then be used to covalently couple the fragment to a thiol-activated surface (63).
