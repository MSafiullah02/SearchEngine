It is not present in the United States. It is spread by direct contact between rabbits, by flies feeding on carcasses, and experimentally by fleas and mosquitoes. A single-dose vaccination of inactivated virus at 8 to 12 weeks followed by an annual booster is generally protective.\u2022Myxomatosis is a lethal, generalized viral disease of rabbits. It is endemic in wild rabbit populations and in Sylvilagus spp. It commonly occurs in the Pacific states of the United States in warmer months. The virus is spread passively on the mouthparts of mosquitoes and fleas. Outbreaks in farmed, laboratory, and pet rabbits result from spillover in wild rabbit populations. A single-dose vaccination of inactivated virus at 8 to 12 weeks followed by an annual booster is generally protective.\u2022Rabbit fibroma virus is endemic in Sylvilagus spp in North America. It is spread by mosquitoes and causes a cutaneous fibroma at the inoculation site with no systemic signs of disease. The fibroma generally regresses within 3 to 4 weeks of infection. It is one of the most common causes of cutaneous neoplasms in pet rabbits.\u2022Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus, also known as Shope papillomavirus, is a cause of papillomas (warts) on nonhaired or thinly haired skin of rabbits. In 66% to 80% of infected rabbits, papillomas develop into carcinomas 8 to 14 months later. The virus is spread from Sylvilagus spp to rabbits by mosquitoes. Infection is uncommon.\u2022Rabbit oral papillomavirus occurs naturally in rabbits and is widespread among domestic rabbits in Europe and the Americas, particularly young animals. The papillomas are localized mostly on the underside of the tongue and usually regress spontaneously within a few weeks to a few months.\u2022The multifactorial enteritis complex of juvenile rabbits can be caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Several different viruses have been isolated from rabbits with diarrhea, such as rotavirus, coronavirus, and astrovirus. Whether natural outbreaks of enteritis can be caused by these viral agents alone or in conjunction with other pathogens (eg, Clostridia spp, Escherichia coli, and coccidia) is not clear.\n\n",

The disease is characterized by fulminant hepatitis with a case fatality rate of more than 90% in adult rabbits. RHD is caused by a calicivirus termed Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) (Family: Caliciviridae; Genus: lagovirus), which since 1985 has spread to or emerged in Europe in wild and domestic rabbits, and in domestic rabbits in Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and the Americas. RHDV was deliberately released in Australia and New Zealand as a biologic control for European rabbits and is now established in the wild in these countries (Table 1\n).1\n",

Viral monitoring indicates that more virulent variants of RCVs, which are genetically distinct from RHDV, are emerging in Europe.15, 16 A related lagovirus, European Brown Hare Syndrome virus (EBHSV), emerged in Europe around the same time as RHDV but does not cause disease in European rabbits.

The highest risk is during the autumn when large populations of infected cottontail rabbits and mosquitoes may coexist. The virus is reported in the Eastern and Midwest states of the United States, including Texas, and in Ontario, Canada.46, 88 Experimentally, mosquito transmission from immunocompetent European rabbits is inefficient, despite high titers of virus in the fibroma, so the European rabbit is essentially a dead-end host and virus spread from either naturally infected or vaccinated rabbits would be unlikely.48, 89, 90 However, suckling rabbits or immunosuppressed adult rabbits in which the immune response fails to clear the fibroma can act as sources for mosquito transmission.90, 91 Direct rabbit-to-rabbit spread does not occur,82 but mechanical spread between rabbits is theoretically possible. Virus dropped into the conjunctivae or nose will infect rabbits. Natural outbreaks in commercial rabbitries have been reported in the United States.88, 92 In a 16-year retrospective study of cutaneous neoplasms in pet rabbits from the University of Pennsylvania veterinary school, 10.5% of skin tumors were RFV-induced fibromas.93\n",

Different PEDV isolates vary in pathogenicity and range from subclinical infection to infection causing more than 50% mortality.185 Lymphoid depletion of splenic follicles, focal degenerative changes in lymph nodes and thymus, proliferative changes in glomerular tufts, and uveitis characterized fatal infections.183, 186 In one infection, multifocal myocardial degeneration and necrosis were seen.187 Antibodies to 2 human strains of coronavirus have been demonstrated in convalescent rabbit sera and antigen to human 229E coronavirus (one of the 4 human coronaviruses circulating worldwide and a proven common cold virus in healthy adults) was detected in myocardial lesions.188, 189 The evidence suggests that the causative agent is not a natural pathogen of rabbits.",
