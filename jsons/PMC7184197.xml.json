ACE2 is a membrane-associated and secreted enzyme expressed predominantly on endothelium [2], but also present in cells of the alveolus, enteric cells, and in epithelial cells of the oral mucosa [3]. The capacity of this virus to develop and replicate in the oral mucosa, and thus in the upper parts of the respiratory system, allows for easy transmission similar to flu viruses. This upper respiratory involvement and high viremia at the beginning of the infection allows for transmission to other subjects even before the appearance of symptoms, which additionally to subjects showing a very mild clinical picture, poses a great epidemiological problem, which also happens with influenza viruses [4], of asymptomatic/presymptomatic carriers. The difficulties in detecting asymptomatic carriers, who often do not know they are infected, undoubtedly facilitates the spread and appearance of unexpected disease foci whose traceability becomes impossible in several cases [5].",

Among them, its capacity to survive for several days outside the host's body helps explain how SARS-CoV-2 spreads by contact [6]. Although of an undoubtedly lower epidemiological role, this capacity indicates a significant difference from flu viruses. This is important when considering the additional faecal shedding of this virus [7]. Although the impact of climate characteristics typical of the end of spring and summer, e.g. high temperatures, longer UV radiation in the longer days, and a lower environmental humidity, causes interruption of the transmission of flu viruses and underlie their seasonality, climatic changes are not likely to have a great impact on COVID-19 transmission dynamics as evident by its already logarithmic spread in countries with warmer climates. The very high temperatures experienced in many countries of the Northern Hemisphere linked to the climate change phenomenon in recent years, e.g. temperatures higher than 40 \u00b0C, could have a negative impact on the transmission capacity of the virus, although for the aforementioned reasons, those factors alone are unlikely to alter the level of transmission.",

Although this would help facilitate the development of efficient vaccines, vaccine development for a virus that has antibody-mediated enhancement is tricky. Thus, a vaccine to impede SARS-CoV-2's ability to become seasonal or to reduce its seasonal impact is challenging. Recent work on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 using computational analyses strongly indicate that natural selection within a human or human-like ACE2 receptor permitted alteration to the most variable part of the coronavirus genome, namely the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SPIKE protein allowing optimal binding to the human ACE2 to arise [8]. This shift in RBD led to its current easy spread among and within humans. Mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome relating to pathogenicity are less variable, thus it does not seem likely for this virus to readily become less pathogenic to humans in the near future, as happened with other previously emerging viruses, e.g. swine influenza. This adds to the question of immunization: will recovered subjects keep an effective immune status? and if yes, for how long?",

Indeed, the crucial characteristics of COVID-19 lie in its transmission pathways, existence of asymptomatic/presymptomatic carriers and survival potential in the external environment, which were already explained and transmitted to the world by the Chinese colleagues since mid-January. So many scientific publications during the last two decades about the capacity of globalization to facilitate the spread of infectious agents seem to have been ignored. Worldwide spread of viruses following different transmission ways, as HIV virus, Ebola virus, Aedes mosquito-borne viruses as those of Zika, Chikungunya and dengue, yearly vaccine problems posed by the quick mutating seasonal flu viruses, seem to have been useless models now in comparison to the very fast spreading new virus. How is it that, in early January, after the recognition that this virus was incubating in China, no leaders seriously considered high risk of an accelerated rate of disease spread posed when Chinese people returned to other countries from their visits to China for the celebration of Chinese New Year?",

The deceptive presentation of countries within the European Union, each acting as if each were working alone, unavoidably poses the question about the usefulness of having a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC, Stockholm). It seems inevitable to conclude that this agency failed in passing the correct message and failed to make the needed timely efforts to convince the leaders of European countries. Surprisingly, the US suffered from similar mistakes as the European countries, including a pronounced delay in creating tests, and in its inexplicable descensions to produce testing criteria that obscured community spread, coupled with a heavy reluctance by the US CDC and US governmental officials to change the testing criteria significantly until mid-March, and the dearth of equipment including lack of needed personal protective equipment, including surgical masks, and facemasks [11] and insufficient quantities of mechanical ventilators for the patients and lack of surgical capacity for hospital beds and ICU space. Much of this reflected the reduction of the Strategic National Stockpile which had been built up throughout the USA in the beginning of this century and slowly degraded to only two locations (Maryland and California), plus the reduction of the Global Health and Security unit (a unit responsible for pandemic preparedness) in the White House National Security staff [12]. The loss of the once robust Strategic National Stockpile for a minimal Stockpile is particularly lamentable, in light of the reality that in the absence of specific treatments, non-pharmacologic approaches rely on supportive therapies with oxygen and ventilatory support, and other equipment coupled with needed PPE that once formed a large part of that Strategic National Stockpile were no longer readily available nationwide. Too often governments focus their defense primarily against other nations and other ideological human actors.

Nearly all South American, Caribbean and African countries have limited national health systems with insufficient capacity to prevent spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate death and disabilities. Several of these nations quickly decided to close frontiers, although generally too late, as they already had the disease inside. All indications reveal that the Southern Hemisphere will not escape from the massive problems of this disease. A worrying scenario for their immediate future. The problem is coupled to the question of the extent to which developed countries will manifest the will and the capacity to help Low and Middle Countries. The outbreak in the Southern Hemisphere is flaring now, and this is happening while the higher income nations are still struggling over their own issues in (i) implementing control measures, (ii) trying to recover from the immense social and economic impacts, and (iii) concentrating in impeding re-entry of the virus by foreigners. Nations everywhere must recognize that in this era of massive global exchange of persons and goods, leaving the outbreaks soring anywhere posses a risk everywhere.",

All of this is not only crucial but urgent [14,17]. Regarding epidemiological data, it is evident that data on infected subjects from the different countries are only indicative but cannot be compared. Diagnostic test application, i.e. test availability and number of health personnel for sample taking and analysis, differs markedly between countries. This does not mean, however, that these data are not internally useful for a country to follow their epidemiological curve and evaluate the success of their control measures applied.",

Another combination with promise is hydroxychloroquine with Remdesivir. More recently, the mechanisms of antiviral effect, the risk-benefit ratio, and the thresholds of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have been reviewed, and attention has been drawn to the need for high-quality evaluation protocols of the potential beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine as a post-exposure drug for people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e. people with close contact with positive tested patients, including home and medical caregivers [19].",
