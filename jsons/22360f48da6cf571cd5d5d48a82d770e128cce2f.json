The pathogenic mechanism and immune regulatory interactions between PEDV and the host remain largely unknown. In this study, the interaction between autophagy and PEDV replication in intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells was investigated. The effects of the structural and nonstructural proteins of PEDV on the autophagy process and the autophagy-related signaling pathways were also examined. The results shown that PEDV replication increased the autophagy flux in IPEC-J2 cells, and that autophagy was beneficial to PEDV replication, which may be one of the reasons for the rapid damage to intestinal epithelial cells and the enhanced virulence of PEDV in both newborn piglets and finishing pigs. When autophagy was pharmacologically induced by rapamycin, PEDV replication increased from 8.5 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 /mL to 8.8 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /mL in IPEC-J2 cells. When autophagy was pharmacologically suppressed by hydroxychloroquine, PEDV replication decreased from 8.5 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 /mL to 7.9 \u00d7 10 4 TCID 50 /mL. To identify which PEDV proteins were the key inducers of autophagy, all 4 structural proteins and 17 nonstructural proteins of PEDV were eukaryotic expressed. It was found that the nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) and ORF3 of PEDV were able to induce significant autophagy in IPEC-J2 cells, but the other proteins were unable to induce autophagy. It was indicated that nsp6-induced autophagy mainly occurred via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The results accelerate the understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of PEDV infection and provide new insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a reemerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. PEDV is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, a condition that presents as severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. As PEDV is highly contagious, the resulting economic burden to the swine industry worldwide is substantial (Bertasio et al., 2016; Gerber et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014a) . Since December 2010, swine farms in China have seen large-scale outbreaks of PEDV infection with typical mortality rates of 50-90% in suckling piglets Chen et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2012) . In the United States, PEDV pandemic strains have caused more than 80 % mortality in suckling piglets and have been rapidly transmitted between farms since 2013. There were over 8 million piglets lost, which represents nearly 10 % of all U.S. farm piglets in 2014 . There were some new features of this PEDV epidemic, including the high mortality rates in suckling piglets. Another feature was the rapid occurrence of diarrhea, dehydration and death, not only in suckling piglets but also in finishing pigs. Numerous studies have focused on viral isolation and molecular epidemiology surveys (Park et al., 2012) , which indicated that PEDV pandemic strains could rapidly replicate in vivo, cause damage to intestinal epithelial cells, and ultimately induce diarrhea, dehydration and death in both newborn piglets and finishing pigs.",

The S protein is located on the surface of the virus particle and is a type I membrane fusion protein. S protein binds to receptors on the target cell, and then, the virus enters the cell through fusion with the plasma membrane or via endocytosis (Chang et al., 2002; Hou et al., 2019; Park et al., 2014; Supekar et al., 2004) . Several viral proteins have a suppressive effect on innate immunity. The N protein directly interacts with TBK1, resulting in the inhibition of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation and type I IFN production (Ding et al., 2014) . Nsp1 blocks the nuclear translocation of IRF1, resulting in a reduction in peroxisomes and thereby suppressing IRF1-mediated type III IFNs . Nsp5, a 3C-like protease, disrupts type I IFN signaling by cleaving NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), which is an essential adaptor that bridges interferon-regulatory factor and NF-\u03baB activation . Nsp6 of coronaviruses is integral membrane protein believed to be involved in double membrane vesicle (DMV) formation (Angelini et al., 2013; Oostra et al., 2008) . Nsp6 of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) generates autophagosomes from the endoplasmic reticulum (Cottam et al., 2014) .",

Autophagy is not only a physiological cellular pathway for self-degradation but also a defense mechanism that protects host cells against pathogen infection (Chiramel and Best, 2017; Maier et al., 2013; O'Connell and Liang, 2016; Rozieres et al., 2017) . Autophagy plays important roles in modulating viral replication and antiviral immune response (McFarlane et al., 2011; Mohl et al., 2012; Monastyrska et al., 2013; Paul and Munz, 2016; Radtke et al., 2013) . Increasing evidence indicates that autophagy plays both anti-viral and pro-viral roles in the life cycles and pathogenesis of a wide range of viruses (Chiramel et al., 2013; Jackson, 2015; Zang et al., 2016) . Previous studies have shown that coronavirus infection is associated with the autophagic process, and that the nonstructural proteins of coronavirus induce the formation of autophagosomes from the endoplasmic reticulum via an omegasome intermediate (Cottam et al., 2011) .",

Whether these biological effects are associated with autophagy is unclear. In our previous research, it was found that the PEDV pandemic strain could activate more significantly autophagy-related signaling pathway compared with the PEDV classical strain in intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, and the proliferation rate of the PEDV pandemic strain was significantly higher than that of the PEDV classical strain, which indicated that there may be a positive correlation between autophagy and PEDV replication (Lin et al., 2017) . It was reported that autophagy was beneficial to PEDV replication in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, and the PEDV-induced autophagy exhibited a positive feedback loop with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Guo et al., 2017) . As an intestinal proliferated virus, the interactions between PEDV and the intestinal porcine epithelial cells are still unknown, which is extremely important for determining the pathogenic mechanism and immune regulatory interactions between PEDV and the host. Moreover, which proteins (structural or nonstructural proteins) are the key inducers of autophagy has yet to be explored. In this study, it was investigated the mechanisms by which PEDV infection affected IPEC-J2 cells autophagy, and by which autophagy affected PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells. The effects of structural and nonstructural proteins of PEDV on the process of PEDVinduced autophagy and the autophagy-related signaling pathway activated by PEDV replication were also examined.",

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco, Life Technologies, USA) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, USA) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. The PEDV strain used in this study, YC2014 (GenBank: KU252649.1), was isolated in our laboratory from a sucking piglet with acute diarrhea, and was propagated in IPEC-J2 cells. PEDV was made replication-incompetent by irradiating 10 mL of suspended virus, dispensed to form a layer of fluid in an open cell culture dish, with UV light for 5 h with gentle shaking at intervals. The absence of virus replication after UV treatment was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3A6 anti-PEDV N protein was prepared in our laboratory. Rapamycin, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-LC3 antibody were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). The Akt-specific inhibitor GSK690693 was obtained from Selleck (Shanghai, China). The lentivirus LV-mRFP-GFP-LC3 was obtained from Hanbio (HB-LP210 0001, Shanghai, China) Wang et al., 2014b; Xu et al., 2014) . The LV-mRFP-GFP-LC3 double fluorescence labeling indicating system produces mRFP to label LC3, and the decrease of GFP indicates the fusion of lysosomes and autophagosomes to form autolysosomes, which is due to the sensitivity of GFP to acid. Thus, when autophagosomes fuses with lysosomes, GFP fluorescence is quenched and only RFP fluorescence can be detected. The yellow spots shown after red and green fluorescence merge together in microscope imaging indicate autophagosomes. The red spots indicate autolysosomes. The intensity of the autophagy flux can be clearly observed by counting the spots in different colors. The primary antibodies against mTOR, phospho-mTOR, p70S6K, phospho-p70S6K, p53, phospho-p53, and \u03b2-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA), or Cell Signaling Technology (MA, USA).",

The ratio of LC3-II to \u03b2-actin is commonly used to assess the activity of autophagy. To further analyze the autophagy activity triggered by PEDV infection, IPEC-J2 cells were infected with the PEDV classical strain CV777 and the pandemic strain YC2014, respectively, and at the indicated time points, the cells were harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotting. The proteins were detected using an anti-LC3 antibody that recognizes both LC3-II and LC3-I, and an anti-PEDV Nprotein monoclonal antibody. The western blot analyses shown that the level of LC3-II increased with increasing incubation time (Fig. 1C) . The ratios of LC3-II to \u03b2-actin were both significantly higher in the classical strain CV777 and the pandemic strain YC2014 infected cells than in uninfected cells after 12 h of infection (P < 0.001, Fig. 1D ). The ratios of LC3-II to \u03b2-actin in the pandemic strain YC2014 infected IPEC-J2 cells were significantly higher than the classical strain CV777 infected cells (P < 0.05, Fig. 1D ). The lentivirus LV-mRFP-GFP-LC3 was used to measure the autophagic flux. The green fluorescence of this tandem autophagosome reporter is attenuated in the acidic pH of the lysosome by lysosomal hydrolysis, whereas the red fluorescence is not. Therefore, autophagosomes have both GFP and RFP signals, whereas autolysosomes have only RFP signals. As shown in Fig. 1E , both GFP-LC3 and RFP-LC3 labeled puncta were observed in both of the PEDV classical strain CV777 and the pandemic strain YC2014 infected cells. Taken together, these data indicate that autophagosomes accumulate in IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV.",

The western blot results shown that there was no detectable conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in cells infected with UV-treated PEDV after 24 h, while autophagy was triggered normally by the nonirradiated, replication-competent virus ( Fig. 3B and C) .

It is well established that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in autophagy (Saiki et al., 2011; Surviladze et al., 2013) . We investigated the effect of nsp6 expression on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by quantitating the expression of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated mTOR, p70S6K, and p53 in nsp6 expressing IPEC-J2 cells. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, the levels of phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K were decreased in nsp6-expressing cells, while the phosphorylation levels of p53 were increased. The viral titers of the rapamycin-treated cells were significantly higher than those of the mock-treated cells (n = 3). Data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. *P < 0.05. (D, E) Inhibition of autophagy with hydroxychloroquine. IPEC-J2 cells were treated with 50 \u03bcM hydroxychloroquine for 4 h prior to PEDV infection (MOI of 10). The cells were lysed and analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against LC3 and \u03b2-actin. (F) The viral titers of the hydroxychloroquine-treated cells were significantly lower than those of the mock-treated cells (n = 3). Data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. H. Lin, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 244 (2020) 108684 To further investigate the role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in PEDV replication, the Akt-specific inhibitor GSK690693 (dissolved with DMSO) was used at a final concentration of 25 \u03bcM. The IPEC-J2 cells were pretreated with GSK690693 for 2 h before PEDV infection. Viral adsorption was performed at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Then, the inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBS. The cells were subsequently incubated in fresh medium containing GSK690693 (10 \u03bcM) until the cells were harvested. The results of western blot (Fig. 6C and D) shown that the levels of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated mTOR were significantly decreased in cells exposed to GSK690693 (P < 0.01), while the levels of LC3-II were increased (P < 0.001). The results of qRT-PCR (Fig. 6E) shown that inhibiting phosphorylated Akt expression could increase PEDV viral titers significantly. These results indicate that inhibition of the PI3K/ Akt/mTOR signaling pathway could increase PEDV replication by increasing IPEC-J2 autophagy.",

            "text": "The role of autophagy in the viral infection process has been widely investigated (Lv et al., 2015; Paul and Munz, 2016) . While autophagy may eliminate viruses from the host cell by delivering them to the lysosomal compartment for degradation (Hernaez et al., 2013) , many viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus type 1, have developed mechanisms to block autophagy, or to utilize the process for their benefit, (Yordy and Iwasaki, 2013) . Viruses such as classical swine fever virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and rotavirus utilize the membranes of autophagosomelike vesicles during replication (Crawford et al., 2012) . New PED outbreaks caused by PEDV pandemic strains have been documented in China since late 2010 and are now distributed all over the world. It was characterized by acute enteric infection and high mortality in suckling piglets and finishing pigs. In this study, we demonstrated that PEDV replication triggers autophagy in IPEC-J2 cells and that autophagy enhances replication of PEDV. It was also demonstrated that PEDV structural proteins (S, M, E, N) are not sufficient to trigger autophagy, and the nonstructural proteins (nsp1-nsp16 and ORF3) of PEDV are required in autophagy programs. These results were consistent with previous research on PEDV-induced autophagy in Vero cells by Guo X. et al. (Guo et al., 2017) . However, Ko S. et al. reported that PEDV infection is suppressed in IPEC-J2 cells by an increase in autophagy induced by rapamycin (Ko et al., 2017) . These different results might occur because of the different degrees of virulence of different PEDV strains. By expressing all 4 structural proteins and 17 nsps of PEDV in eukaryotic cells, we found that autophagy was triggered by the expression of nsp6 or ORF3, but not by the expression of the other proteins, in IPEC-J2 cells.",

This observation was supported by the increased expression of autophagic marker proteins during PEDV replication. Using PEDV that was rendered replication-incompetent (but still infectious) by UV irradiation, it was found that viral replication induces autophagy. The LV-mRFP-GFP-LC3 lentivirus was used to measure the autophagic flux. The green fluorescence of this tandem autophagosome reporter is attenuated in the acidic pH of the lysosome by lysosomal hydrolysis, whereas the red fluorescence is not.

By analyzing the expression of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated mTOR, p70S6K, and p53 in nsp6-expressing IPEC-J2 cells, we shown that nsp6 induces autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The relationship between autophagy and PEDV replication was further confirmed through RNAi experiments, in which the endogenous p53 gene was specifically silenced. RNAi-mediated silencing of p53 expression decreased the viral titer compared to the mock-treated group. These data also demonstrate that the autophagy triggered by PEDV is via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.",

These results improve the understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of PEDV infection and provide novel insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies.",
