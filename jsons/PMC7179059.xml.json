The intellectual virtue of courage requires an individual to distinguish between what one ought to fear and ought not to fear. Current evidence supports the clinical judgment that with effective infection control, the risk of infection with COVID-19 from patients can be managed such that the risk is very low. Such a level of risk should not be feared. The risk of infection without effective infection control does not minimize risk. In such clinical circumstances, medical faculty and learners are justified to fear infection. The scope of risk extends beyond an individual, that is, the scope also includes others whom medical faculty and learners have an ethical obligation to protect, such as family members, friends, and neighbors.",
