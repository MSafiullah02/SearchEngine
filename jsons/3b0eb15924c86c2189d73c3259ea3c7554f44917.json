While most of the current approaches for cross-modal retrieval revolve around learning how to represent text and images in a shared latent space, we take a different direction: we propose to generalize the cross-modal relevance feedback mechanism, a simple yet effective unsupervised method, that relies on standard information retrieval heuristics and the choice of a few hyper-parameters. We show that we can cast it as a supervised representation learning problem on graphs, using graph convolutions operating jointly over text and image features, namely crossmodal graph convolutions. The proposed architecture directly learns how to combine image and text features for the ranking task, while taking into account the context given by all the other elements in the set of images to be (re-)ranked. We validate our approach on two datasets: a public dataset from a MediaEval challenge, and a small sample of proprietary image search query logs, referred as WebQ. Our experiments demonstrate that our model improves over standard baselines.",

More specifically, we are interested in re-ranking a subset of candidate images retrieved from the whole image collection by an efficient base ranker, following standard multi-stage ranking architectures in search engines [36] . Directly including visual features in the ranking process is actually not straightforward due to the semantic gap between text and images: this is why the problem has initially been addressed using standard text-based retrieval, relying for instance on text crawled from the image's webpage (e.g. surrounding text, title of the page etc.). In order to exploit visual information, and therefore improve the quality of the results -especially because this text is generally noisy, and hardly describes the image semantic-, many techniques have been developed since. For instance, some works have focused on building similarity measures by fusing mono-modal similarities, using either simple combination rules, or more complex propagation mechanisms in similarity graphs. More recently, techniques have emerged from the computer vision community, where text and images are embedded in the same latent space (a.k.a. joint embedding), allowing to directly match text queries to images. The latter are currently considered as state-of-the-art techniques for the cross-modal retrieval task. However, they are generally evaluated on artificial retrieval scenarios (e.g. on MSCOCO dataset [34] ), and rarely considered in a re-ranking scenario, where mechanisms like pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) [31] are highly effective.",

Compared to joint embedding approaches, we tackle the problem in a different view: instead of learning new (joint) embeddings, we focus on designing a model that learns to combine information from different modalities. Finally, we validate our approach on two datasets, using simple instances of our general formulation, and show that the approach is not only able to reproduce PRF, but actually outperform it.",

Many extensions of GCNs have been proposed (e.g. GraphSAGE [21] , Graph Attention Network [50] , Graph Isomorphism Network [57] ), some of them directly tackling the recommendation task (e.g. PinSAGE [59] ).

Thus, using initial order might be a too strong prior, and add noise information. Moreover, in the case of implicit feedback (clicks used as weak relevance signals), using rank information raises the issue of biased learning to rank (sensitivity to position and trust biases). It is also worth to emphasize that, contrary to most of the works around graph convolution models, our graph structure is somehow implicit: while edges between nodes generally indicate a certain relationship between nodes (for instance, connection between two users in a social network), in our case a connection represents the visual similarity between two nodes.",

All images appearing in the top-50 candidates for these queries within a period of time of two weeks have been labeled by three annotators in terms of relevance to the query (binary label). Because of different query characteristics (in terms of frequency, difficulty etc.), and given the fact that new images are continuously added to/removed from the index, the number of images per query in our sample is variable (from around ten to few hundreds). Note that, while we actually have access to a much larger amount of click logs, we choose to restrict the experiments to this small sample in order keep the evaluations simple. Our goal here is to show that we are able to learn and reproduce some PRF mechanisms, without relying on large amount of data. Moreover, in this setting, it is easier to understand model's behaviour, as we avoid to deal with click noise and position bias. After removing queries without relevant images (according to majority voting among the three annotators), our sample includes 952 queries, and 43064 images, indexed through various text fields (title of the page, image caption etc.). We select seven of such fields, that might contain relevant pieces of information, and for which we compute two simple relevance features w.r.t. query q: BM25 and DESM [39] (using embeddings trained on a large query corpus from an anterior period). We also add an additional feature, which is a mixture of the two above, on the concatenation of all the fields.

Hence, three parameters are tuned (the two mixture parameters, and the number of neighbors for the query), following the evaluation methodology introduced in Sect. 4.2 10 . The LTR models are standard MLPs: they correspond to the upper part of architecture Fig. 1 (text branch), and are tuned following the same strategy.",

            "text": "We do not compare our models with joint embedding approaches on those datasets for the reasons mentioned in Sect. 2, but also due to our initial experiments on Medieval which gave poor results. For the sake of illustration, on MediaEval, 64% of the queries have no lemmas in common with training queries (and 35% for WebQ): given the relatively small size of these datasets, the models cannot generalize to unseen queries. This illustrates an \"extreme\" example of the generalization issues -especially on tail queries-of joint embedding techniques. In the meantime, as our model is fed with learning to rank features, especially term-based relevance scores like BM25, it could be less sensitive to generalization issues, for instance on new named entities. However, we want to emphasize that both approaches are not antagonist, but can actually be complementary. As our model can be seen as an extension of listwise learning to rank for bi-modal objects (if edges are removed, the model reduces to a standard MLP-based learning to rank), it can take as input node features matching scores from joint embeddings models. The model being an extension of PRF, we actually see the approaches at different stages of ranking. Table 1 gathers the main results of our study. Without too much surprise, going from pure text ranker to a model using both media types improves the results by a large margin (all the models are significantly better than the text-based LTR model, so we do not include these tests on Table 1 for clarity). Moreover, results indicate that combining initial features with the unsupervised cross-modal similarity in a LTR model allows to slightly improve results over the latter (not significantly though) for the MediaEval dataset, while it has no effect on WebQ: this is likely due to the fact that features are somehow redundant in our setting, because of how s T (q, .) is computed for the cross-modal similarity; the same would not hold if we would consider a richer set of features for the LTR models. Furthermore, the DCMM-cos model outperforms all the baselines, with larger margins for MediaEval than for WebQ; the only significant result (p-value < 0.05) is obtained for the MAP on MediaEval. Nevertheless, it shows that this simple architecture -the most straightforward extension of cross-modal similarity introduced in Sect. 3.1-, with a handful of parameters (see Table 1 ) and trained on small datasets, is able to reproduce PRF mechanisms. Interestingly, results tend to drop as we increase the number of layers (best results are obtained with a single convolution layer), no matter the number of neighbors chosen to define the visual graph. While it might be related to the relative simplicity of the model, it actually echoes common observations in PRF models (e.g. [3] ): if we propagate too much, we also tend to diffuse information too much. Similarly, we can also make a parallel with over-smoothing in GNNs [33] , which might be more critical for PRF, especially considering the simplicity of this model. The DCMM-edge shows interesting results: on WebQ, we manage to improve results significantly w.r.t. to CM sim, while on MediaEval, results are slightly worse than DCMM-cos (except for the MAP). It might be due to the fact that images in the latter are more alike to the ones used to train image signatures, compared to the (noisy) web images in WebQ; hence, learning a new metric between images has less impact. Interestingly, for both datasets, best results are obtained with more than a single layer; we hypothesize that the edge function plays the role of a simple filter for edges, allowing to propagate information from useful nodes across more layers. Note that the number of layers needed for the task is tied with how we define our input graph: the less neighbors we consider for each node, the more layers might be needed, in order for each node to gather information from useful nodes. In Fig. 2 , we observe that if the number of neighbors is too small (e.g. 3 or 5), then the model needs more layers to improve performance. On the other side, when considering too many neighbors (e.g. 20 or all), the nodes already have access to all the useful neighbors, hence adding layers only reduces performances. We need to find the right balance between the number of neighbors and the number of convolution layers, so that the model can learn to propagate relevant signals (e.g. 10 neighbors and 3 layers for WebQ).
