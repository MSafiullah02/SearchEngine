Medical professionals are facing difficult decisions as they need to prioritise Covid-19 patients who are most likely to survive, thus elderly may be last in line to receive scarce resources such as ventilators and medications. Moreover, hospitals are being emptied and new admissions are restricted to create the headroom for Covid-19 patients meaning elderly will need to receive more care at homes.",

First, all carers need to have access to PPE to protect themselves, their families and the vulnerable. So far, many local care providers struggled to procure those essentials. 7 Second, testing is also needed to more accurately gauge the spread of the disease and the extent of those most affected in the community rather than just in hospitals. Carers, just like medical workers, are at risk of physical and mental exhaustion and thus those measures are only the first steps to provide support. 8 Third, large numbers of people have become unemployed or unable to work due to lock-downs and social distancing; this has created a large pool of individuals who can potentially work in social care. People who have lost their jobs in retail, hospitality, airlines or other sectors could provide care to elderly or vulnerable people by providing companionship, household support and regulated services should they be trained appropriately. Unlike nurses and doctors, social care staff can be trained and deployed within days and weeks, rather than years, helping to address both a capacity issue in the system and support people seeking employment. 9 Finally, as loneliness due to isolation is rising, technology plays a role in helping people communicate safely. This benefit should be applied to social care. Patients could connect with their families but also carers can connect with other carers and operational teams. Apart from connectivity, digital solutions can offer online tools to assess a patient's condition and risk, thus identifying early signs of disease which could lead to early interventions and better recovery.",
