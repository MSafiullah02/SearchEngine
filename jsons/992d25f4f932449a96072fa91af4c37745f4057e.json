The use of corticosteroids in patients presenting with ARDS of different etiologies remains controversial owing to mixed results in the existing literature, mainly derived from observational studies (27) . Globally, high-dose glucocorticoids is among the most frequently used adjuncts in ARDS (17.9%) (28) . Systemic corticosteroids have long been used among critically ill patients presenting with ARDS given their role in lowering the circulating levels of proinflammatory mediators (29, 30) . Moreover, adequate and prolonged glucocorticoid supplementation have proved to mitigate the Critical Illness Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency (CIRCI), thus enhancing resolution of lung and systemic inflammation (31) . One systematic review conducted an analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials, and found that, compared with the placebo group, prolonged glucocorticoid treatment improved clinical outcomes (32) . A recent individual patient data meta-analysis combined four RCTs evaluating prolonged methylprednisolone therapy for ARDS and reported a significant reduction in mortality, with an increase in ventilator-free days (13 vs. 7, p < 0.001) (33) .",
