They derive their name from their characteristic \u2018crown-like\u2019 appearance in electron micrographs imbued by a fringe of club shaped spike (or peplomer) proteins inserted into the viral envelope. Virions are lipid enveloped and are approximately 80\u2013120 nm in diameter; there is a single stranded genome of positive sense RNA approximately 30 kb in length. They also have a characteristic replication strategy, in that the positive sense genomic RNA is first transcribed into negative sense intermediate RNAs (by a virus encoded transcriptase) from which a nested 3\u2032 co-terminus set of five to eight subgenomic mRNAs (six subgenomic RNAs for human coronaviruses) are transcribed. The subgenomic mRNAs have identical 3\u2032 ends but extend for different lengths in the 5\u2032 direction (Lai, 1990).",

The spike glycoprotein is of particular importance in the infectious process because: (a) it is the site for the virus anti-receptor (Collins et al., 1982); (b) it has fusion activity (De Groot et al., 1989); and (c) it contains sites against which major neutralising antibodies are directed (Jimenez et al., 1986). The composition of the spike glycoprotein is therefore very relevant to the ability of the virus to evade the hosts' immune system (La Monica et al., 1991).",

Indeed, human coronaviruses are though to be responsible for approximately 20% of common colds (McIntosh et al., 1970), as well as lower respiratory tract infections in infants (McIntosh et al., 1974) and the exacerbation of asthma (Johnston et al., 1995). Prospective studies have indicated that such human coronavirus induced respiratory infections tend to occur in cycles, with a periodicity of approximately 3 years (Monto and Lim, 1974).",

The existence of pre-existing coronavirus antibody directed to the same serotype is not protective against further coronavirus infection (Callow, 1985). Natural antibodies against a particular serotype of coronavirus were protective for approximately four months only, after which time re-infection by the same serotype of human coronavirus could occur.",

Next, five separate \u2018primer pair mixes\u2019 were prepared containing either (i) 0.2 \u03bcl of primer JH1 and 0.2 \u03bcl of primer JH2; (ii) 0.2 \u03bcl of primer JH3 and 0.2 \u03bcl of primer JH4; (iii) 0.2 \u03bcl of primer JH5 and 0.2 \u03bcl of primer JH6; (iv) 0.2 \u03bcl of primer JH16 and 0.2 \u03bcl of primer JH24; and (v) 0.2 \u03bcl of primer JH14 and 0.2 \u03bcl of primer JH28 (see Table 1) per first round PCR amplification undertaken.

A 1:10 (v/v) dilution of the first round amplification products was then prepared in sterile UHQ water and 5 \u03bcl of the resultant PCR product dilution added to each of its five respective complete second round reaction mixes.

Also, it was envisaged that the use of a touchdown PCR methodology would help to circumvent any non-specific priming (Don et al., 1991); this was considered particularly important because the human coronavirus 229E spike gene PCR primer design protocol utilised limited the number of possible primer sequences available for spike gene amplification.

In particular, both a reduced sequencing accuracy rate (Naeve et al., 1995) and the generation of artifactual chromatogram peaks (Parker et al., 1995) have been associated with the use of such chemistry. Indeed, Parker et al. (1995) indicated that the use of automated dye-terminator sequencing chemistry resulted in chromatogram artifactual peaks whose presence was determined by the nucleotide sequence immediately 5\u2032 (i.e. downstream) to the artefact itself. Interestingly, it was noted that the nucleotide sequences immediately 5\u2032 to chromatogram artefactual peaks in this project did not correspond with the 5\u2032 nucleotide sequences generating artefactual peaks indicated by Parker et al. (1995) (even though automated dye-terminator sequencing chemistry was utilised in both projects). This apparent discrepancy was brought about by the fact that Parker et al. utilised Amplitaq enzyme (Perkin Elmer) in their dye-terminator sequencing reactions, whereas in this project Amplitaq FS (FS, fluorescent sequencing) enzyme (Perkin Elmer) was utilised. The conclusion therefore being that the pattern of chromatogram artefactual peaks generated in dye-terminator sequencing chemistry reactions by these two enzymes is somewhat different.",

This appears to contrast with another member of the same coronavirus serogroup as human coronaviruses 229E, canine coronavirus (Horsburgh and Brown, 1995) in which heterogeneity was distributed throughout the spike gene sequences of two geographically distinct (one British and one American) isolates. Also, a high degree of genome recombination events has been observed during mixed infections with different murine coronavirus strains (Lai et al., 1985) and different avian infectious bronchitis virus strains (Kusters et al., 1990). Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that in the absence of selection pressure these recombination events occur in a random manner (Banner and Lai, 1990). As only minor changes are seen in the translated spike protein sequences obtained in this project, it may be possible that during human coronavirus 229E infections selection pressure plays a dominant role in limiting the degree of spike gene variation (alternatively, multiple human coronavirus 229E infections may be a relatively rare event).",

In particular, MRC5 (Medical Research Council No. 5) human embryonic lung fibroblasts were the final replicative host for human coronavirus 229E strain ATCC VR-74, whilst Clone 16 human embryonic lung fibroblasts (the 16th clone of heteroploid MRC-c cells Philpotts, 1983) were the final replicative host for human coronavirus 229E \u2018LP\u2019 (Raabe et al., 1990). As MRC5 and MRC-c cells are closely related, it may feasible that adaptation of human coronaviruses 229E to these similar cell lines may facilitate similar spike protein conformations. These similar spike protein conformations would be expected to have similar protein sequences and by reverse translation, similar spike gene sequences. Further, if such \u2018convergent evolution\u2019 does indeed occur, then it is possible that the spike gene sequences obtained from serially passaged, tissue culture adapted human coronaviruses 229E may differ from the spike gene sequences of the original isolates. In this case, the accuracy of spike gene sequence data from human coronaviruses 229E which had been isolated by serial passage in tissue culture may be called into question. In this project, spike gene PCR amplification of human coronavirus 229E isolates LRI 281 and A162 was undertaken directly from clinical specimens.",

This point is illustrated most obviously upon examination of the translated spike protein sequence of human coronavirus 229E A162, where three apparent clusters of nucleotide variation were observed, all in the 5\u2032 half of the translated spike protein sequence. Interestingly, research by Banner et al. (1990), working with mouse hepatitis virus, indicated that the 5\u2032 end of the murine coronavirus spike gene may be the preferred site for RNA recombination events for this particular coronavirus. Moreover, comparisons of the spike protein sequences of avian infectious bronchitis virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, murine hepatitis virus and transmissible gastro-enteritis virus have indicated that the 3\u2032 (C-terminal) portion of the spike protein is rather more conserved than the corresponding 5\u2032 (amino-terminal portion) portion of the spike gene (Cavanagh, 1995).",

Such an interpretation would tend to suggest that spike protein variation does not play a major role in the aetiology of human coronavirus 229E re-infection. However, in order to assess fully the role that spike protein variation has upon human coronavirus 229E re-infection, further work is required. In particular, sequencing of the spike genes from other chronologically and geographically distinct human coronaviruses 229E should be undertaken. Further, by cloning and expressing the spike proteins of human coronaviruses 229E in vitro, it may be possible to assess the role of the immune system in the aetiology of human coronavirus 229E re-infection.",
