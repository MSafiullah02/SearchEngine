The BIG-LoVE cohort, with weekly sample collection regardless of symptoms is informative. Most episodes of virus detection were brief with a mean \u22642 weeks. However, the association with symptoms varied by age and virus. Detections of human metapneumovirus, influenza A, and the parainfluenza viruses were strongly associated with symptoms (>75% for all viruses). In the clinical setting, detection of these viruses is likely associated with the illness under evaluation. In contrast, approximately half of the episodes of bocavirus and rhinovirus were asymptomatic, and prolonged asymptomatic detection occurred in 14% and 22% of episodes, respectively. Others have reported prolonged detection of bocavirus of up to 28 days [34] . The mean duration of rhinovirus detection by PCR in 1 study was 10.1 and 11.4 days for immune competent adults and children respectively [17] . Another study demonstrated rhinovirus detection for >30 days in approximately 5% of children younger than one year [36] .
