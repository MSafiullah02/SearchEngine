The key principles in the law of responsibility establish that responsibility will arise when an internationally wrongful act has been committed, which constitutes a breach of international law, and which is attributable to the international actor concerned.2 In this chapter we apply the principles of the law of responsibility to the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic, arguing that legal responsibility can be established at an international level on the part of the World Health Organisation (WHO) for their delayed action in respect of the West African Ebola response.\n",

The overarching goal of the Regulations is to prevent, detect and respond to the international spread of infectious diseases and other public health emergencies,11 whilst at the same time attempting to prevent unnecessary restrictions being placed upon trade and travel to affected states.12 The Regulations define a PHEIC as an extraordinary event which is determined: (i) to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and (ii) to potentially require a coordinated international response.13\n",

Other events\u2014MERS in 2013 and yellow fever in 2016\u2014have been considered potential PHEICs, but have not resulted in declarations. The seemingly inconsistent approach the WHO takes to declaring, or not declaring, an event a PHEIC has resulted in some considerable criticism of the Organisation and its decision-making processes in this area.17 While the focus of this chapter is on the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, as this is arguably the most controversial use of the WHO\u2019s PHEIC powers in the new millennium, it is important to note that our arguments in respect of Ebola are generalisable to other PHEICs. We return to this later in the chapter.",

The law of responsibility enables legal action to be brought against a responsible actor at the international level.20 As Hafner stated, \u201caccountability seems to reflect primarily the need to attribute certain activities under international law to such actors as a precondition for imposing on them responsibility under international law.\u201d21\n",

If an international legal obligation had been breached then this offended the wronged state\u2019s sovereign rights and, consequently, such state should have the ability to reinforce and uphold its rights. Consequently, the law of responsibility was the law of state responsibility.22 In spite of this early limitation, the ability to apply this law beyond the state was soon being called for.23 These calls largely arose in response to the growth of international organisations, both in terms of number and powers. This eventually led in 2009 to the International Law Commission (ILC) developing the Articles on the Responsibility of International Organisations (ARIO).24 In spite of the established differences in nature and powers of states and international organisations,25 the ARIO largely mirror the ILC\u2019s earlier Articles on State Responsibility,26 which are well established within international law. While the principles may largely still be in their infancy in respect of international organisations, there exists a breadth of state-based practice to assist in the interpretation and application of such principles.",

Second, the ability to declare a PHEIC in a timely fashion must be considered to not just be a power of the WHO, but a legal obligation as well.

A more concrete idea can be found in legal personality, which identifies subjects of international law capable of possessing rights, duties, powers and, crucially, obligations and liabilities of their own accord, and distinct from those of its Member States.28 This firmer legal concept can be aligned with the idea of identifying a separate will of an organisation; in addressing autonomy and the idea of a distinct will, many commentators focus on the presence (or absence) of legal personality.29 Personality is important not only in identifying a distinct identity on the part of the organisation, but it also in establishing whether an organisation has the capacity to incur responsibility as a distinct actor on the international stage. In spite of personality being slightly more concrete than the overarching idea of autonomy, there does not exist a clear definition of personality in international law. International law is largely state-centric, and states are presumed to have legal personality by their very nature; but the expansion of personality beyond the state has not led to a clear definition.",

This criticism has given rise to continued debate as to precisely how to establish personality.32 In spite of the criticism, an engagement with the concepts in the statement, while somewhat difficult, becomes almost inevitable.

Indeed, the role, functions, and powers of such organisations are organic in nature: they grow, shift and develop over time without a conscious statement of the intentions of the member states that are enabling this growth and development. Many organisations now differ substantially in role, functions, and powers from those which were created in the post-war era, with much of this development having been unconscious and evolutionary as opposed to explicit member state reform. The consequence is that, to identify personality, intentions are inferred from considering aspects of the institution: such as a degree of permanency and distinct purposes and powers, the existence of organs within the institution with the capacity for decision making, and the exercise of powers, without the prior approval of the member states.33\n",

Under its auspices exist the World Health Assembly, the Executive Board, and the Secretariat, each of which has a number of distinct powers to act on behalf of the WHO. The Assembly, for example, determines policies and adopts regulations, which can be seen as akin to a legislative process. It is also able to adopt conventions with respect to the objectives of the WHO. The Executive Board exists as an executive organ of the Health Assembly, although it must be noted that it has some degree of independence from the Assembly, and thereby from the Member States that make up the Assembly. For instance, while membership of the Board is elected by the Assembly, the Board does not need to reflect the national membership of the Assembly,40 implying that the Board members are acting in a manner that is institutionally distinct from the Assembly and the Member States. Moreover, the Board elects its own Chair and sets its own rules and procedures,41 addresses any questions within its competence,42 sets the agenda for the Assembly,43 and proposes the general programme of work for the Assembly to vote upon.44 Each of these powers and duties of the Board implies that it is distinct from the Assembly and the decision-making powers of the Member States that make up the Assembly. Most notably in this regard however, is the fact that the Board has the power to take emergency measures within the functions and financial resources of the Organisation to deal with events requiring immediate action. In particular it may authorise the Director-General to take the necessary steps to combat epidemics, to participate in the organisation of health relief to victims of a calamity and to undertake studies and research the urgency of which has been drawn to the attention of the Board by any Member or by the Director-General.45\n",

This Report clearly discusses the WHO as an actor distinct from its Member States. Indeed, many Member States of the WHA were already signatories to the Convention by this stage, the implication being that the membership of its Member States was insufficient to bind the WHO to the Convention, and accession by the WHO as a distinct legal actor was required.

While the International Health Regulations provides the Director-General with the power to declare an extraordinary event a PHEIC, we argue that the Director-General actually has a legal obligation to declare an event a PHEIC and to do so in a timely manner. The first element of this obligation to declare may have been eventually fulfilled but (as we will argue in a moment), the failure to declare the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak a PHEIC in a timely fashion was not, and therefore constitutes an internationally wrongful act, for which responsibility ought to arise on the part of the Organisation.",

Article 13 of the IHR states that a PHEIC Declaration being made triggers the following response from WHO:At the request of a State Party, WHO shall collaborate in the response to public health risks and other events by providing technical guidance and assistance and by assessing the effectiveness of the control measures in place, including the mobilisation[sic] of international teams of experts for on-site assistance, when necessary.62\n\n",

A PHEIC declaration is clearly a central tool through which this obligation is fulfilled. Not only is there a general obligation to declare a PHEIC when appropriate in a timely fashion, but the WHO-AU Agreement created an obligation upon the WHO to do as much as possible to contain disease outbreaks in African Union Member States which would clearly include declaring a PHEIC where appropriate.

As such, the appropriate and timely declaration of a PHEIC is central in ensuring the obligations for preventing crises and spread of disease mentioned both generally within the WHO Constitution, and specifically in the particular agreement between the WHO and the AU.

Internal WHO communications show clear concerns about the severity of the outbreak and the lack of action on the part of the WHO, including the virus spread being worse than the data implied and continued pleas for assistance from staff on the ground not being answered, as well as refusals to consider convening an Emergency Committee, which would begin the process of declaring a PHEIC.73 These communications show that there was a two-month delay from the WHO having become aware of the severity of the outbreak in West Africa to an Emergency Committee being convened.74 Taking two months to begin to move towards the process of declaring a PHEIC is not plausibly timely, especially when taken together with the knowledge of how severe the outbreak was becoming.",

The UN has sought to address two main parts within this fund, one aspect being compensation for the victims and another being about eradication and prevention. There is a target for $200 million for each of these parts.87 However, it was initially unclear whether this should be funded from the general budget or from member state contributions.
