            "text": "In the last few decades, the demand for safer environmental conditions has increased dramatically. The burden of infectious diseases worldwide, related to contamination via contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites), is a growing issue. Globally, these infections are linked to an estimated 1.7 million deaths a year from diarrheal disease and 1.5 million deaths from respiratory infections [1] . Apart from hospitals, the problem has become a growing liability at places where food is prepared and handled [2] , where there is a growing risk associated with the cross-contamination of edible goods and where large amounts are handled by a single facility [3] . Already many E. coli and Salmonella outbreaks have been recorded and linked to single a facility [2, 4, 5] . The problem of cross-contamination via surfaces can also be traced, in smaller scale, to households where common areas can accumulate pathogens that can potentially become a threat, especially to more sensitive population groups [6] . There are also biological threats in forms of dangerous epidemic outbreaks (Ebola and SARS) and biological warfare weapons (anthrax and smallpox). The need for effective and efficient disinfection is driving the industry in the development of a wide range of products. These products can currently be divided into three major categories: \u2022 Chemical disinfectants: Chemical-based disinfectants are currently the majority of the commercial disinfectants, and they have been used for the longest time. Most of them are chlorine-, alcohol-, or ammonium-based products. They are in liquid form and therefore are limited to surfaces. The majority is used to disinfect contaminated surfaces and not as a prevention of contamination. Although their use is relatively simple and easy, they can still be dangerous if they are misused. Gases can also be used for the disinfection. However, the use of other disinfection methods which are based on the use of biocidal gases such ethylene oxide [7] , hydrogen peroxide [8] , ozone [9] , and chlorine dioxide [10] also has limitations associated with toxicity [11] potential material damage, and in some instances downtime of the space or equipment being treated. \u2022 Radiation-based disinfection: Radiation is a very effective technique since it can immediately inactivate the majority of the contaminants without damaging the surroundings [9, 12, 13] . Still however, the use is limited since it usually requires expensive equipment and under certain conditions, exposure to the used radiation can be proved dangerous [9, 14] . \u2022 Passive disinfectants: Passive disinfectants are characterized as those that do not require a certain application (chemicals) or operation (radiation), but constantly purify and clean surfaces, air, and water. Current air disinfection technologies, such as the use of upper-room UV-C irradiation (Ultraviolet 254 nm), [9, 12] high efficiency particulate (HEPA), and air filtration [15] , have shortcomings. UV is associated with health risks [14, 16] , requires the upper-room installation of UV fixtures, and relies on a well-mixed air concept. HEPA filters remove bacteria and viruses from the air effectively, but there are excessive costs associated with the energy needed to move air through the filter, and for filter replacement [17] . In addition, they do not deactivate the contaminants; so, if they are not replaced regularly, they can become a source of contamination rather than disinfection medium. One of the most promising and rapidly emerging means of disinfection is photocatalysis, which does not share any of the shortcomings of the aforementioned methods. Photocatalysis is the type of reaction that takes place on the surface of a certain type of material in the presence of a very specific range of radiation [18] . There is a large selection of materials that can display this type of reaction, but the most widely used is titanium dioxide, TiO 2 , or titania. Titania in addition to the high efficiency is cheap and environmentally safe, already used widely as pigment and food additive. However, there are significant limitations, which constrain the wider range of applications. Among them, the most notable is the relative low efficiency as compared to the chemical techniques.",

Although they possess a large number of unique properties, probably, the most outstanding are their electric properties. In addition, their needle-like shape results in very high specific surface area. Both characteristics (electric properties and high surface area) are essential to the enhancement of photocatalysis, as will be evident in this chapter.",

            "text": "The first report on photocatalytic activity was by Becquerel in 1839, when he observed voltage and electric current on a silver chloride electrode when it was immersed in electrolyte solution in the presence of sunlight [21] . Generally speaking, all semiconductors can display photocatalytic properties, but usually, the oxides and compound semiconductors are demonstrating significantly better results [22] [23] [24] [25] . The ability of a semiconductor to undergo photocatalytic oxidation is governed by the band energy positions of the semiconductor and redox potentials of the acceptor species. The latter is thermodynamically required to be below (more positive than) the conduction band potential of the semiconductor [24, 26] . The potential level of the donor needs to be above (more negative than) the valence band position of the semiconductor in order to donate an electron to the vacant hole. Figure 22 .1 shows some of the most popular semiconductor photocatalysts represented with their band energy positions. Among them, TiO 2 is the most popular as it is efficient, effective, requires shallow UV radiation, is very cheap to manufacture, environmentally safe, and easily incorporated with other materials. Since 1972, when the ability to split the water under UV radiation was first discovered [27] , there has been great work in understanding the mechanism and the reactions that take place. Figure 22 .2 schematically represents the steps of photocatalysis. Initially when a photon of proper energy (hn ! E g ) strikes the surface of the semiconductor, it generates an electron hole pair (h + -e \u00c0 ). Both electron and holes either recombine or migrate to the surface, where, they proceed with chemical reactions. The holes are generating OH\u2022 and the electrons H 2 O 2 . A very important factor for those processes is the required time. These reactions are summarized, with the estimated time required for each one [28] , measured with laser flash photolysis [29, 30] : In order to photo-reduce a chemical species, the conductance band of the semiconductor must be more negative than the reduction potential of the chemical species; to photo-oxidize a chemical species, the potential of the valence band has to be more positive than the oxidation potential of the chemical species. The energies are shown for pH 0 ",

In addition, the electrons that are excited at those levels are trapped, and the holes have sufficient time for OH \u2022 generation. Even in the case that hn ! E g and the electron is excited to the conduction band, then during the de-excitation process the electron is going to be transitioned from the conduction band to the trap levels and then to the valence band which again retards the recombination and therefore increases the overall efficiency.

The addition of metal, which is not chemically bonded to the TiO 2 , can selectively enhance the generation of holes by scavenging away the electrons. The enhancement of the photocatalysis by metal was first observed using the Pt/TiO 2 system [46, 47] by increasing the split of H 2 O to H 2 and O 2 . In particular cases, the addition of metal can affect the reaction products. Figure 22 .4 demonstrates the effect on titania band structure when titania is coupled with a metal. In general, when a semiconductor that has work function ' s is compared with a metal with work function of ' m > ' s , the Fermi level of the semiconductor, E f s , is higher than the Fermi level of the metal E f m (Fig. 22.4a) . So when the two materials are brought into contact (Fig. 22.4b) , there will be electrons flowing from the semiconductor to the metal until the two Fermi energy levels come to equilibrium. The electrons transition will generate an excess of positive charge that creates an upward band bending. This bending creates a small barrier (in the order of 0.1 eV) that excited electrons can cross and be transported to the metal. From the moment the electrons migrate to the metal, it is not possible to cross back since the barrier for this action is larger, and therefore, the electrons will remain in the metal.",

Iijima reported the creation of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNT) with outer diameter up to 55 \u00c5 and inner diameter down to 23 \u00c5 . Since that time, extensive theoretical and experimental research for the past decade has led to the creation of a rapidly developing research field. In 1993, Bethune et al. [59] reported the discovery of the single-wall nanotubes (SWNT). The very small diameter of the single nanotubes and the very big length makes them to behave as quantum wires, giving them very interesting properties. Due to the fact that the SWNT usually contains a small number of carbon atoms (usually < 102), they have attracted almost all the theoretical work. They possess some remarkable electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties that are related mainly to their diameter and chirality. Due to their importance and relevance to the photocatalysis, the electronic properties will be discussed in more detail later.",

This is due to the rehybridization of the s and p orbitals, that is less intense and the tubular structure approaches more the graphite structure. This basically means that while the tube diameter increases, the energy gap is diminishing even for the semiconducting tubes.

Alternatively, the SWNTs can exhibit semiconducting properties which is a well-documented mechanism to enhance photocatalysis (discussed in the previous section). However, in addition to the intrinsic electronic properties and the CNT have also a very high surface area. Since photocatalysis is a surface reaction, more surface means more efficiency. In addition, CNTs due to their black color can further assist the photocatalysis by further increasing the amount of the adsorbed light. As explained, TiO 2 requires UV light in order to excite an electron with enough energy to overcome the band-gap. The UV spectrum represents only 5 % of the available total sunlight spectrum. Being able to use a larger portion of the spectrum of natural sunlight for photocatalysis is an important aspect for commercialization of the technology as UV usage is not always recommended [69] .",

In one case, there is the formation of a uniform thin coating of titania around the MWNTs.

Alternatively, there is the formation of the titania nanoparticles on the surface of the nanotubes which is actually one of the most common configurations. This is typically achieved by nucleating and growing titania on dispersed CNTs in a liquid medium. A drawback is the formation of free titania nanoparticles instead of only those on the surface of nanoparticles.",

Therefore, one of the biggest challenges is the proper dispersion of the CNTs. Improper dispersion will result in coating MWNTs aggregates instead of the single MWNTs. This is not a trivial task since the graphite sheet of the MWNTs is hydrophobic, making this task almost impossible. Sun and Gao [82] developed a method to increase hydrophilicity of CNTs dispersible in water via heating in an ammonia atmosphere at 600 C. Other methods use surface charges stemming from acid groups that were introduced by treatments in hot oxidizing mineral acids [73, 77, 83] . This process results in the generation of -OH and -COOH groups on the surface of the nanotubes. These groups make the CNTs hydrophilic making them dispersible in water and in addition act as nucleation points for the coating to initiate.",

The most common characteristic of the titanium alkoxide precursors is their high reactivity with water to yield TiO 2 , which in general is amorphous at room temperature with small seeds of anatase phase. The reactivity controls the speed of the reactions and therefore the uniformity of the coating. Faster reaction rates usually result in large particle-size distributions of the primary particles. The addition of acids or bases is one possibility to change the reaction rate [69, 72, 73, 81] . The reactivity is controlled primarily from the chain length of the alkoxide with longer chain resulting in slower reaction. The most common precursor is titanium isopropoxide [69, 72, 77] , since it combines several desirable characteristics. It readily dissolves in alcohols and is not overly sensitive to humidity. An alternative is titanium butoxide [73, 78] , which is even less sensitive to humidity; however, its higher viscosity may cause problems when dissolving it in ethanol at high concentrations. There are also reports where titanium ethoxide was used, but it is preferred for the formation of TiO 2 particles on the surface of the nanotubes, since the precise control of the reaction is very hard [71] . Alternatives to the titanium alkoxides in sol-gel are titanium tetrachloride [53] and titanium oxysulfate (TiOSO 4 ) [78] , which have been used in the past for the synthesis of TiO 2 rutile and anatase particles, respectively. These precursors can be used in water, but this requires the CNTs to be dispersed in water, which can be challenging. Recently, CNTs have also been coated via hydrothermal methods [53, 71, [78] [79] [80] using mostly titanium tetrachloride [53] and TiOSO 4 [78] .",

It is worth mentioning that the coating of single-wall nanotubes was reported only recently [85, 86] . Single-wall CNT coatings are of importance since the electronic properties of tubes are better defined than in multiwalled CNTs.

Such methodologies again involve chemistries very similar to the sol-gel route. One of the major differences is the addition of a polymer to form the backbone of the structure. Huey and Sigmund [88] have measured the mechanical properties of such fibers. The modulus of elasticity was found to be above 250 GPa for the CNT reinforced anatase nanofibers, which is significantly higher compared to less than 100 GPa, which was found for the electrospun pure anatase nanofibers.

A high-energy photon excites an electron from the valence band to the conduction band of TiO 2 . As discussed the recombination of the hole and electron is the dominant mechanism. The nanotubes especially those that have metallic properties can accept the photogenerated electrons, leaving the holes in the TiO 2 to take part in redox reactions. However, according to the theory of photocatalysis, the work function is a critical parameter to the creation of the rectifying contact. Table 22 .1 compares the work function of the nanotubes to the work function of other traditional metals among which are Pt and Au, both used to improve photocatalysis. Carbon nanotubes compare very well with the other metals, since they are only slightly below Au. Therefore, the utilization of carbon nanotubes as the core of the photocatalytic composite is expected to enhance the photocatalysis since it has the ability to increase the efficiency by both methods mentioned earlier, high specific area and metallic properties. In addition, as it was discussed earlier, carbon can act as a dopant to the titania structure. In this scheme, the carbon can generate trap levels in the band-gap that can change the transition of the electrons trapping them for short period of time. This gives time to the hole to lead the reduction reaction.",

There are two parameters that are very important for the CNT-TiO 2 composite to work. The most essential parameter is the electronic configuration of the CNTs. It was shown by Pyrgiotakis that although CVD and arc-dischargesynthesized CNTs appear to have the same properties, number of tubes, diameter, etc., their core electronic properties are drastically different (Fig. 22.6a, b) [89] . As it was described in section \"Electronic Properties\", the electronic properties of the nanotubes depend on the coherence of the various layer of the MWNT. The catalyst-assisted CVD-grown MWNTs result in a more random growth, while the lower temperature of the reactor prevents the various defects to self-correct. This results in a large number of defects that compromise the electrical properties of the MWNTs. Although at macroscopic level, those defects do not significantly impact their usage, this become essential at the nanoscale level. In the case of photocatalysis, the electrons need to transit to the underlying MWNT. If, however, there are defects, the electrons' ability to transfer to the MWNT is reduced, impacting significantly the photocatalyitc ability of the CNT-TiO 2 composites. This was proved experimentally by Pyrgiotakis where both arc discharge-and CVD-grown MWNTs were coated with TiO 2 via sol-gel processes. Although both nanocomposites were structurally similar under the TEM, the photocatalytic activity was ten higher for the arc discharge MWNT compared to the CVD-grown nanotubes. However, even in the case of the CVD-grown MWNTs, the enhanced photocatalytic activity can still occur mainly due to the fact that the tubes still provide an electron depository, carbon doping, high surface area, higher light adsorption, and higher pollutant adsorption.",

This bond serves two different purposes: From one side, this bond can activate the carbon as dopant for the titania, similar to carbon-doped titania, and on the other side, it is a channel to transfer the electrons to the MWNT. A composite that does not have this bond will be missing the dopant mechanism and will have significantly reduced ability to transport the electrons. Pyrgiotakis confirm the presence of Ti-O-C bonds in both types of nanocomposites with X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [90] , Raman Spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) [89] . In addition to the confirmation of the bond, Raman spectroscopy confirmed that arc-dischargesynthesized CNTs must have a higher electrical conductivity and fewer defects. This is also supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the nanocomposites. The bond was later confirmed by Wang et al. in composites synthesized via the hydrothermal process [80] .",

However, the application of a thin TiO 2 coating on the carbon nanotubes is not enough to yield very high photocatalytic efficiency. As it was shown, the bond (C\u00c0O\u00c0Ti) created between the MWNTs and the TiO 2 is essential for the creation of a highly reliable photocatalytic material [90] . The bond makes the underlined carbon atoms dopants to the structure of titania and provides a channel for the electrons to diffuse to the nanotube. However, the metallic nature of the carbon nanotubes is equally critical as the bond. Overall, carbon in the form of carbon nanotubes can be a very promising way to enhance the photocatalysis, but the carbon nanotubes must be very well defined, with distinct structure and good electrical properties.",
