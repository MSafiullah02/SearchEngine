Bronchiolitis was defined as an acute infection of the lower airways, characterized by increased respiratory effort (tachypnea and/or use of accessory respiratory muscles) and expiratory wheezing and/or crackles and/or apnea. Medical history and demographic data were collected from questionnaires and medical records. The study was approved by the Committee on Research involving Human Subjects of the University Nijmegen Medical Centre and written informed consent was obtained from all parents.

Patients were classified into three different groups based on the severity of disease. The mild group was children without hypoxia or severe feeding problems. The moderate group included children requiring hospitalization for supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding.

In line with this finding, Marguet et al.12 observed a shorter duration of hospitalization in children with RSV/RV dual infection compared to those with single RSV infection suggesting that infection with RV has no additional, and potentially a protective effect on disease severity. In addition, children with multiple viral infections including RSV did not suffer from more severe disease compared to those without RSV. This may be explained by either differences in age or type of immune response. The induced immune response upon viral infection may protect the host from infection with a second virus as has been proposed by Greer et al.26 who described a potential protective effect of RV through the stimulation of the interferon (IFN) stimulated genes inducing an antiviral state that prevents the patient from a more severe course of disease after second infection with a new virus.",

This has been described before11 and possible explanations why detection of more than one virus is less frequently observed in the most youngest infants are; (1) less exposure to viruses due to less day\u2010care attendance, (2) the development of more and earlier severe symptoms upon single viral infection, and (3) partial protection against respiratory viruses because of protective maternal antibodies which disappear with age.",

Most studies have described a positive relation between higher RSV load and disease severity28, 29, 30, 31 In addition, an association of higher viral load with young age has been previously reported.32 Our sample size was rather small compared to these studies and age specific analyses for viral loads were therefore not performed. Finally, a number of limitations need to be considered. First, we only included children during the winter season, from November until April. This may have created a bias toward a higher incidence of RSV. While RV infections are present throughout the year with peaks in autumn and spring, RSV does rarely appear out of winter season in the Netherlands. Data from a registry of the Dutch Working Group on Clinical Virology showed that in 2006 and 2007 51% of the annual RV infections were detected between November until April compared to 94% of the annual RSV infections (published with permission of the Dutch Working Group on Clinical Virology). Second, we only included children presenting in a hospital, which may have caused a bias. Third, we analyzed infections with other viruses than RSV as a group (RSV negative infections) instead of analyzing them separately, because the low number of samples infected with other viruses than RSV. To further reveal the association between young age, multiple infections and disease severity in children with bronchiolitis, more large\u2010scale clinical studies in various health care settings are required.",

Remarkably, in children older than 3 months we found an association between more severe disease and RSV mono\u2010infections. Our results suggest that other factors than infection with multiple viruses contributes to disease severity, of which age is the most important risk factor.",
