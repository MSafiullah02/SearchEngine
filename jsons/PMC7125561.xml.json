In North America especially, this complex represents the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in 6- to 10-month-old beef cattle after entry into feedlots (United States Department of Agriculture, 2000).1 The financial losses are in part due to mortality, which can reach up to 69% in beef calves during first 2 months of arrival.2 Reduced growth performance and overall treatment costs (eg, metaphylactic and therapeutic use of antibiotics) for BRDC in a 1000-cattle feedlot has been estimated to be $13.90 per animal, assuming calves are slaughtered after 200 days on feed; labor and handling costs excluded.3\n",

            "text": "The BRDC is a multifactorial disease arising from a combination of environmental, host, management, viral, and bacterial factors. The disease often develops along with stressful conditions such as weaning, shipping, commingling, dietary changes, and adjustments to the feed yard environment. These conditions favor viral infections of the lower respiratory tract that may become further complicated by Mannheimia haemolytica serotype 14 and Pasteurella multocida, both commensal bacteria of the nasal cavity. Viral infections well known to play an important role in the development of BRDC include bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI-3). Most cattle arriving at feedlot are routinely vaccinated against these viruses, which has led to a decrease in incidence of these primary pathogens. However, other viral agents continue to cause substantial losses due to BRDC (Sanjay Kapil, unpublished data, 2008). There is currently a growing body of evidence1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 showing that bovine coronavirus (BCoV) may be involved in the development of BRDC.",

The virus has been detected on all continents and there is serologic incidence (>90%) that suggests most cattle become exposed to BCoV in their lifetime. In a recent study, the presence of BCoV in lungs was second in incidence after bovine herpesvirus.15 Both in beef and dairy herds, BCoV can be associated with calf diarrhea, calf respiratory disease, winter dysentery, respiratory disease in adult cattle, and combined pneumonia and diarrhea in calves and adults.16, 17 The coronavirus strains isolated from nasal secretions and lung tissues of cattle with fatal cases of pneumonia have been classified as bovine respiratory coronaviruses (BRCoV). The coronavirus strains isolated from neonatal calves and adult cattle with diarrhea are referred to as bovine enteric or enteropathogenic coronaviruses (BECoV).18 Furthermore, for clinical purposes, BECoV can be further subdivided into BCoV- induced calf diarrhea (BCoV-CD) and winter dysentery (BCoV-WD). The clinical manifestation of the disease syndromes are not solely related to the virus itself but also to host and environmental factors; for example, the immunologic status of the animal, environmental temperature, and secondary coinfections with other pathogens.19\n",

            "text": "Researchers have debated over last several years whether BCoV isolated from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts of affected cattle are the same virus or are dissimilar, perhaps altered in biologic, antigenic, and genetic (sequence) properties. Several publications have supported the hypothesis that enteric and respiratory BCoV may be the same virus detected at different stages of its infectious life cycle.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 Early reports28, 29 suggested antigenic and genomic similarity between isolates of BCoV from the respiratory and enteric tracts of cattle. Later studies5, 25, 30, 31 identified differences in antigenic, genomic, and culture characteristics between the 2 groups of BCoV isolates. At present, it is still unclear whether isolates of BRCoV and BECoV can be distinguished antigenically.30, 32 Specific factors associated with their respective tropism for the respiratory or digestive tracts are also undefined. The reasons for scientific uncertainties33 include that BCoV RNA genome is the longest (approximately 32,000 bases) compared with other animal viruses and is capable of further evolution. In addition, the number of complete sequences published on this virus is scarce, for example, 4 isolates comprising Mebus (U00735), Qu\u00e9bec (AF220295), and Louisiana (NC_003045) enteric and respiratory BCoV. Due to the insufficient number of BCoV isolates sequenced, an accurate comparison of BECoV and BRCoV origin is therefore difficult to establish. Moreover, there are temporal changes and geographic differences that further confound the conclusions.34\n",

In one study, peak of BCoV shedding in nasal secretions occurred at 3 days before arrival and in feces, at 3 days following entry to feedlot, under field conditions.20 Researchers have proposed that replication and shedding of BCoV in nasal secretions is first initiated through the respiratory tract (oropharynx) then spreads to the gastrointestinal tract through the swallowing of large quantities of virus with subsequent shedding in the feces.20, 49 Other reports have documented BCoV shedding in both nasal passages and feces within the same animal concurrently.20, 21, 22 Respiratory disease can be consistently reproduced experimentally in young calves using a pneumoenteric BCoV, Minnesota-1988 (MN-1988).50, 51\n",

One study involving 837 calves in 4 feedlots from 2 states (Ohio, Texas) showed that the BCoV shedding or seroconversion status did not affect the average daily gain.8 However, shedding of BCoV in feces of 6- to 7-month-old cross-bred feedlot steers was associated with a reduced weight gain of 8.17 kg (17.9 lb) during a period of 21 days.21 In an Ohio feedlot,32 calves that seroconverted to BCoV gained 5.9 kg (13 lb) (26%) less than the nonseroconverted group during the first 21 days after arrival to the feedlot. Seroconversion to BCoV was almost associated significantly (P<.06) with reduction in weight gain but not with clinical signs. In one report involving 203 feedlot calves from New Mexico and Arkansas, animals shedding BCoV in nasal secretions, feces, or both, gained on average 8 kg (17.64 lb) less than calves that were not shedding the virus over a 35-day period following entry.20 Therefore, BCoV infections may contribute directly to economic losses in feedlot cattle by impacting weight gains or, similar to other respiratory viruses, by predisposing cattle to secondary bacterial infection.",

If fluorescent antibody testing or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used for detection of BRCoV, the actual incidence may have been higher. The reason RT-PCR gives higher estimates of BCoV infection in lungs is because, at core body temperature, the replication of BCoV may be diminished.

Large concentration of BCoV can be typically found in the spiral colon. Infected epithelial cells die, slough off, and are replaced by immature cells. Stunting and fusion of adjacent villi and atrophy of colonic ridges may be seen on microscopic examination of BCoV-infected small and large intestine, respectively.69, 71, 73, 74, 75 In case of malabsorptive diarrhea caused by BCoV, the fluid load in the gut lumen can be further exacerbated by the compensatory hyperplasia and secretions from the crypt epithelial cells.76 The absorptive and digestive capacity of the intestinal tract is therefore compromised by loss of surface area and presence of immature cells, which are unable to secrete the normal digestive enzymes.76, 77, 78 Lesions and consequences are most severe in younger animals.47\n",

A yellow to blood-stained mucus-containing diarrhea initially develops, which then progresses to a profuse watery diarrhea.23, 51 When the fluid intake is insufficient to meet the losses, affected animals become clinically dehydrated, depressed, weak, and hypothermic, and their suckle reflex is loosened.

Epithelial cells of colonic crypts are destroyed by viral action, leading to degeneration, necrosis of crypt epithelium, and petechial hemorrhage, without involvement of the Peyer patches. Fine streak of frank blood or large blood clots may be present in the lumen of the spiral colon, distal colon, and rectum.91, 104 Even though histologic changes have been observed predominantly in the colonic mucosa, blood from the distal duodenum was observed aborally in cattle that died of winter dysentery.104 Loss of intestinal mucosal epithelium from colonic crypts leads to transudation of extracellular fluid and blood. The respiratory tract of BCoV-WD affected animals may show hyperemia of the tracheal mucosa and localized foci of pneumonia.107\n",

Bovine respiratory coronavirus can only be identified through laboratory confirmation of appropriate specimens submitted. Suggested antemortem samples for BRCoV infection in calves and adult cattle include nasal swabs submitted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) or normal saline in red-top tubes. Oropharyngeal fluid collected with a probang cup can be used to diagnose BRCoV in adult cattle. Trachea (upper one-third), and lungs can be collected at necropsy. However, the distribution of BCoV in the lungs is focal and thus, it is critical that multiple pieces are submitted for virus detection. Viral antigen has been detected in the apical and middle lung lobes of calves infected experimentally with BCoV (MN-1998) whereby 5% to 10% of the macrophages were positive for BCoV (Fig. 1\n) (Tawfik Aboellail, and Sanjay Kapil, unpublished data, 2000). Other suitable respiratory tissues include nasal turbinates, but these may be difficult to sample. Nasal turbinates and nasal glands have been found to be strongly positive for BCoV antigen using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence (Figs. 2 and 3\n).117 Spiral colon is the sample of choice for detection of BECoV at necropsy because the virus persists in that specific location for the longest time after oral infection.50 A fresh fecal sample collected directly from the rectum can be also included, as cattle with respiratory disease commonly shed the virus in the feces concomitantly. Approximately 2 to 5 g of fresh feces can be sent to the laboratory in wide-mouth jars. It is important to submit all tissue and fecal samples over ice-packs using overnight delivery to increase the likelihood of BCoV detection.",

Another useful diagnostic reagent is 8F2 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), which binds to nucleocapsid protein of BCoV, the most predominant protein of the virus (www.ruraltechinc.com).119 The 8F2 reacts with the viral antigen in formalin-fixed intestines (see Fig. 3) and lungs. The 8F2 MoAb reacts with a conserved epitope of the antigenic group 2 coronaviruses such as alpaca, equine, camel, and elk coronavirus. Other laboratory-based methods for detection of BCoV include hemagglutination assay using mouse erythrocytes; this method, with modification (such as slide agglutination test), can be used in developing countries and for animal-side testing. RT-PCR assays can be used for sensitive detection of BCoV in clinical samples. The targets are the conserved nucleocapsid gene for detection of the virus and spike gene for epidemiologic investigation and strain differentiation. At present, there is no commercial test available for BCoV antigen detection in the United States. However, lateral flow immunoassays (LFT) are useful cow and calf-side tests, and are available in European Union for BCoV antigen detection in the feces.120\n",

However, because viral infection can predispose to development of secondary bacterial infection in the lungs and the fact that BCoV cannot be differentiated clinically from other important viral or bacterial pathogens involved in BRDC, parenteral antibiotic therapy administered early in the disease process, at sufficient dosage and duration, is recommended to prevent or limit the development of bacterial pneumonia in cattle with viral respiratory tract infection.55 The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as flunixin meglumine (Banamine), currently labeled specifically for the control of pyrexia associated with BRDC in the United States, has been shown to be useful in other viral pneumonias (eg, PI-3) by improving clinical signs and reducing lung consolidation.121 However, flunixin meglumine may not be cost-effective when used in large feedlots and can potentially lead to renal toxicity or abomasal ulceration if overdosed, used for prolonged periods of time, or used in severely dehydrated animals. Approved in the European Union for use in food animals, a single injection of the long-acting NSAID meloxicam (Metacam) administered as an adjunct therapy for BRDC in feedlot cattle resulted in substantial pharmacoeconomic benefit.122 Based on a limited number of publications123, 124 and due to its impairment of immune function, it is usually not recommended to use corticosteroids as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of undifferentiated pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Other ancillary therapies suggested for treatment of BRDC have included Vitamin C or B injection, bovine respiratory vaccine (IBR, BVDV, BRSV, PI-3) at the time of BRDC therapy, antihistamines, anthelmintics (eg, levamisole), probiotics, and oral electrolytes; however, no published data are available to support their use.123, 124\n",

Protection of the respiratory tract from BRCoV has not been well studied except for one trial60 in which extralabel use of the modified-live coronavirus and rotavirus vaccine in feedlot calves administered intranasally significantly decreased the subsequent rate of treatment for respiratory disease in cattle that had relatively low serum antibody titers against BCoV at arrival.60 More specifically, there was an overall reduction of 26% among vaccinated calves treated for BRDC on entry to the feedlot. Furthermore, BCoV vaccinated calves with detectable intranasal BCoV had a 36% reduction in treatment for BRDC, and those with low antibody titers at arrival had 42% reduction, compared with unvaccinated calves. Although the 26% and 36% reduction was not statistically significant, it was considered clinically significant. The association between antibody titers against BCoV at feedlot arrival seems to correlate with protection from respiratory tract infection, and may promote higher weight gains1 and reduce virus shedding in nasal secretions.138 In one study, feedlot cattle that had BCoV antibody titers of greater than 1600 did not shed BCoV fecally or nasally.32\n",
