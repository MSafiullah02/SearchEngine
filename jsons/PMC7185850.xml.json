The AAA, as described above, is slightly structured and it includes, primarily, pet-visitation. These kind of activities are in general spontaneous, grouping several patients, and poorly standardized with regard to duration and type of activities. On the contrary, the AAT sessions are strictly organized considering both the activity type and the duration. Indeed, each AAT session presents individualized goals and is conducted by specifically trained couples (handler and animal) [3]. Unfortunately, there is no uniformity on naming these interventions and AAT, AAA and other names are used, often, in a confusing way. To make even harder to compare the studies different animals were used. Although dog is the most common, generally every species can be employed.",

In particular, some interventions focused on frail patients as elderly [6], [7] or children [5], [8]. Furthermore, AAT and AAA are implemented in different settings like hospitals, nursing homes and schools [4], [5]. The employment of Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) resulted increasingly popular, especially among pediatric patients. Chur-Hansen et al. conducted a critical review regarding AAI for children inpatients. This review focused primarily on the methodology of the retrieved studies. Precisely, the authors concluded that the evidences regarding AAI are scant, and more standardized studies (in particular RCTs) about this topic are required [9]. Another recent review considered only the available RCTs regarding AAT, retrieving overall eleven studies (published from 1990 to 2012). The authors outlined a relatively low quality of the recovered papers. However, the study highlighted some benefits of the AAT, especially in case of psychiatric disorders. The animals employed in these interventions were disparate, from dogs to dolphins or ferrets. The authors identified some areas requiring further insights such as costs, reasons to refuse the intervention and potential adverse effects. Moreover, the authors highlighted how the description of the intervention in terms of length, activities and settings, in the studies included in the review, was not always obvious [4].",

Both studies underlined some positive effects of these interventions. In particular, the study of Chu, highlighted an increase in self-esteem, self-determination, and a decrease in positive psychiatric symptoms and emotional symptoms after 8 weeks of AAA (p < 0.05) [10]. The study by Villalta showed a significant improvement from baseline after a dog-program in social contact score, in positive and negative symptom dimensions and in quality of life [21]. However, no significant difference was assessed between the group experiencing AAT and the control group [21]. Nurenberg et al. considered the effectiveness of the AAT in reducing aggressiveness in chronic psychiatric inpatients, including various psychiatric diagnosis (76% presented schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder). The authors compared two different AAT, the first using dogs and the second horses. Certified pet therapists, following the \u201cPet-Partners guidelines\u201d, conducted both these interventions. The reduction of violent incidents was significantly greater in the EAP group (p < 0.035), while other generic benefits were assessed for both the AAT interventions. These positive effects were maintained for several months [19].",

These papers ranged from 2000 [37] to 2013 [38], and included guidelines, recommendations, clinical trials, cross-sectional surveys and reviews. Two studies investigated the prevalence of infective agents in pet-visitation animals in hospitals or in long-term care facilities [17], [44]. The first investigation is a broader survey that considered all the hospitals located in the Ontario region with a pet visitation program. In particular, this investigation analyzed aural, nasal, oral, pharyngeal and rectal swabs of over 100 visitation dogs, identifying Clostridium Difficile as the most common isolated organism [17]. Moreover, 17% of these isolates were indistinguishable from the toxigenic microorganisms responsible of the human disease. In the feces samples, the authors retrieved also Salmonella and Escherichia Coli (partly in antibiotic-resistant forms). Furthermore, some samples were positive to parasitology and mycology analysis. These microorganisms were carried asymptomatically by dogs, but can be dangerous especially for immunocompromised patients [17]. Coughlan et al. focused on Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) colonization among residents animals (one dog and eleven cats) in a long-term care facility [44]. The authors considered a large long-term care facility with over 100 beds, characterized by the presence of resident animals. The researchers collected nasal swabs from the animals for overall eight weeks. Two cats presented MRSA positive swabs and the test positivity was confirmed in subsequent tests. In the meantime, human MRSA infections occurred in the facility [44].",

Two of the selected hospitals interrupted the AAA program, during 2003, due to the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Precisely, Khan et al. considered the AAA or AAT implementation in healthcare settings, especially in hospitals [37]. The second review focused specifically on the healthcare environment of Europe and North America [39]. The zoonosis can be a risk especially for very young, old or immunosuppressed patients [37], [39]. All the animals mostly used in AAI can act as a source of infections. Not only zoonosis could be a risk, but also other common infections as MRSA. However, the application of hygiene protocols consented an effective risk minimization [39]. Moreover, the repeated health screenings for the animals and the careful selection of patients, using special precautions in case of open wounds and immunosuppression can help to control the risks [37]. Another risk is allergy; anyhow, the reasoned selection of patients and animals can effectively reduce this risk. Finally, animal-related accidents can be practically canceled following appropriate guidelines [39]. Therefore, the reviews concluded that the benefits overhang risks. In particular, Khan et al. recommended a careful selection of the patients, excluding patients with splenectomy, dog allergy, positive to Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, with pyrexia of unknown origin or infected with MRSA [37].",

            "text": "The guidelines about AAI and pet-visitation agreed over the main key points, suggesting hand hygiene after all animal contacts and avoiding as possible contacts with animal bodily fluids [16], [38], [39], [40], [41]. All animals used for AAT must be selected carefully, avoiding the most dangerous species as reptiles and primates [16]. Moreover, animals must follow strictly veterinary health screenings, vaccine programs, and be specifically trained for these activities. To minimize the allergic risk, bathing and grooming animals prior each session could be useful. After each session, routine cleaning protocols should be implemented. Finally, inclusion of patients with severe immunosuppression, known allergy or animal phobia should be carefully considered, assessing benefits and risks [16], [38], [39], [40], [41]. In particular, Sehulster et al. reported the CDC guidelines for environmental infection control in health-care facilities, including a section regarding the safety of AAA and resident animals programs in healthcare settings. On the contrary, in their guidelines [16], Sehr et al. considered exclusively a program of private pet-visitation in hospital. In this case, the authors excluded immunocompromised patients, newborns and patients in post-anesthesia care units. Moreover, the authors registered overall positive evaluations of the nurses regarding the guidelines implementation [38]. The work of Jofr\u00e8 et al. consisted in a review of guidelines, in order to achieve a consensus regarding animal use in healthcare settings. As well as underlining the importance of regular veterinary checks and strict sanitary protocols, the authors recommended to avoid the use of puppies in order to minimize the infection risk [41]. Similar guidelines are adopted also in hospital implementation protocols [42], [43]. In particular, these programs excluded all patients in post-operative period, with recent splenectomy or severe immunosuppression [42]. Silveira et al. reported the implementation protocol of an AAA program in a Brazilian University hospital. This protocol included a wide range of potential employed animals, including dogs, cats, fishes, rabbits, reptiles and other rodents [42]. Similarly, Kobayashi et al. reported the Board of Nursery experience concerning the implementation of an AAT project in a University hospital. In particular, the authors adapted the CDC guidelines to their specific setting [43].",

Our search revealed extremely heterogeneous results, in terms of settings, target population, type of intervention and considered outcomes. However, most studies focused on particularly frail population groups as children [8], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], psychiatric inpatients [10], [11], [19], [20], [21] and elderly patients [6], [7], [13], [14], [29]. The relationship with the animals can be extremely useful for these patients especially focusing on communication and social behaviours [7], [11], [28]. In particular, considering psychiatric diseases, schizophrenic inpatients would benefit from animal contact considering schizophrenic symptoms, social relationships and aggressiveness [10], [19], [21]. The reduction in aggressive behaviors was outlined, not only in psychiatric inpatients, but also considering general inpatients [35]. The studies regarding adults were rare, but they considered different diseases including orthopaedic surgery and high-risk pregnancies [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36].",

The prevalent use of dogs is explained by the easier training for therapy; however, also other species can be potentially beneficial. Interestingly, the papers retrieved highlighted how \u201cpet therapy\u201d programs can be effectively implemented in a wide range of settings including Emergency Departments [34], long-term care facilities [6] and hospital wards [35]. Although all the interventions retrieved took place in hospitals or in long-term care facilities, the specific location of the interventions differed. Indeed, some interventions took place in the hospital garden [19] or in activity rooms specifically equipped [11], while others occurred directly in the ward [33], [34], or at bedside [25], [27]. Also considering the interventions\u2019 characteristics, the results appeared variegated. In as much, the length of the sessions ranged from 5 to 10 minutes [32], [35] to different hours [24]. Moreover, some programs required multiple sessions [6], [8], [11], [21], while others included only a single session [13], [34]. These important organizational differences make extremely difficult to compare the retrieved intervention, and to draw clear conclusions. Furthermore, not all the studies exactly described the specific train and formation of the couple animal-therapist or handler. About this, some studies declared to adhere and follow the \u201cPet Partners Guidelines\u201d [8], [19]. The AAT interventions resulted, in accordance to their definition, more structured, organized in limited groups and conducted by certified therapists. On the contrary, the described AAA ranged from simple pet-visitation to spontaneous activities. In this case, the specific formation of the couple dog-handler is less described, and in one case, the dogs are accompanied only by the investigators, and not by the handler [10].",

            "text": "Therefore, the implementation of AAI can be interesting in a wide range of age and pathologies, but further and more standardized studies are required to exactly assess the pathologies mostly benefited from these interventions. The main limitations were linked to the heterogeneity of the retrieved studies considering both the outcomes and the quality, making the comparison quite difficult. Indeed, in accordance with previous reviews [4], [15], the previous cited findings are limited by the overall low quality of the retrieved studies. Indeed, only few works were RCTs. Moreover, most of the included papers presented limited samples that could affect the overall results. Therefore, more studies are required to completely describe the potential effects of AAI. In fact, some studies lacked of a control group [7], [14], [20], [33], while others were pilot studies considering limited samples [10], [11], [21]. Moreover, some papers lacked details of randomization [26], [33] or considered only parents or patients opinions [7], [8], [36]. Hospitals are particularly at risk settings, thus introducing animals has to be carefully considered. Various studies explored these risks outlining infections, allergies and animal accidents as major issues [16], [37], [38], [39], [40]. The potential risk of infections was outlined investigating the prevalence of infective agents in animals used for pet-visitation [17], [44]. These studies outlined the potential risk related not only to typical zoonosis, but also to common human infections as MRSA [17], [44]. However, reviews and guidelines suggested that the implementation of all security precautions could effectively minimize risks [16], [37], [38], [39], [40]. Therefore, the identification of patients receiving AAI should be carefully conducted. Some studies described in detail the sanitary protocols adopted for the animals involved, including regular veterinary visits, vaccination documentation and assessments of controllability and temperament [11], [23], [26], [35], [36]. On the contrary, other works did not explicitly refer to any of these procedures. This matter represents another limitation of our review. Indeed, detailed information regarding the health surveillance protocols are desirable in order to correctly evaluate the considered interventions. The extensive Canadian survey regarding dog visitation highlighted how the infection control protocols result variable and occasionally potentially inadequate. In particular, the knowledge concerning the potential risks amongst the dog-handlers seemed insufficient [45]. Consequently, a closer cooperation between hospital staff, AAI-team, and veterinarians seems necessary. In addition, stricter controls about AAI safety in the hospital are desirable.",
