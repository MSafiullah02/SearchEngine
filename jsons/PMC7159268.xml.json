The basic reproductive number of MERS-CoV was estimated to be less than 1\u00b70, suggesting low transmissibility.4, 5 However, a 2013 outbreak of MERS-CoV infection in Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia, where one patient infected seven other patients in dialysis and intensive care units,6 raised concerns about potential so-called super-spreaders7 that were reported during the SARS epidemic.8, 9\n",

Patient 14 was exposed to Patient 1 outside the hospital and sought additional care at our hospital without knowing he was infected with MERS-CoV. Therefore, we experienced both South Korea's first MERS-CoV case and the case of highest transmission of MERS-CoV following a single patient exposure in an emergency room.

We searched PubMed for reports published in English from May 1, 2015, to Dec 31, 2015, using the terms \u201cMERS-CoV\u201d and \u201cKorea\u201d. We identified 38 reports, none of which provided detailed description for the contact investigation of massive transmission of MERS-CoV from a super-spreader in an overcrowded emergency room setting.\nAdded value of this study\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to categorise exposed patients into groups according to the type of exposure and to document group-specific incubation periods and attack rates. Furthermore, this study provides detailed epidemiological data, including a floor plan of the emergency room, to understand how MERS-CoV spread by a single super-spreader through several modes of transmission.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nResults from our contact investigation showed increased transmission potential of MERS-CoV from a single spreader, as has been documented in the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. The potential for similar outbreaks anywhere in the world should be noted, as long as MERS-CoV transmission continues in the Middle East. Our study provides evidence that hospitals, laboratories, and governmental agencies should be prepared for MERS-CoV infection.\n",

We identified, from electronic medical record review and security video footage, all patients who had been in the emergency room with Patient 14 as contacts, regardless of the location and duration of exposure. We categorised patient contacts into three groups on the basis of their maximum exposure: patients who were in the same zone in the emergency room (group A; considered close contacts), those who were in different zones but had time overlap with Patient 14 in the registration area or radiology suite (30 min before and 2 h after; group B), and those who were in different zones (group C). Patients who were admitted to hospital for treatment of their primary illness after exposure in the emergency room were quarantined in private rooms for 14 days from the last exposure or discharged home after treatment was finished and continued isolation at home. Patients and their family members who were already discharged home were reached by telephone, informed about possible MERS-CoV exposure, and provided with hotline numbers for any inquiries.",

Patients' demographic information, underlying disease, dates of emergency room visit, duration of stay with exact arrival and departure times, and location within the emergency room were collected. If radiographic examinations were done, the time of examination was collected. For health-care workers, age, sex, occupation, history of patient assignments and working or visiting zone, and dates and time of duty or emergency room visits were collected. The attack rate was calculated by dividing the number of confirmed cases by the total number of exposed individuals in the emergency room in each group. Because the total list of visitors was unavailable, we estimated the number of visitors who were in the emergency room by assuming that one patient had at least one visitor during their stay; we also simulated the scenarios of two and four visitors per patient. To avoid underestimation, we chose the assumption of one visitor per patient, which would give the highest attack rate among the scenarios. The incubation period was defined as the time of first exposure to the onset of clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV infections.",

Incubation period and exposure time were compared among groups with Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Tukey's test using ranks for multiple comparisons. To assess the risk factors for MERS-CoV infection among all patient contacts, we did a multiple logistic regression analysis based on likelihood ratio, by regressing on age, sex, underlying disease, and groups. In a subgroup analysis of patients in group A, the length of stay in the same zone and location were included. For these analyses, odds ratios and 95% CIs were reported. p values and 95% CIs were adjusted with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons if necessary. Two-sided p values of less than 0\u00b705 were considered significant. We used SAS version 9.4 and GraphPad Prism version 6.04 for statistical analyses.",

More than 200 patients are seen in the emergency room each day; the average duration of stay in the emergency room was 15 h before the MERS-CoV outbreak (see appendix p 2 for details on emergency room overcrowding index). The emergency room has seven patient care areas, including zones I to IV for adults, a trauma zone, a resuscitation room, and a paediatric zone (figure 1\n). The paediatric zone and zone IV are separated from the rest of the main areas. Two negative-pressure rooms are located in the paediatric zone and two are in zone IV. The emergency room has its own radiology suite for emergency room patients only. The sizes of each zone were as follows: zone I 121\u00b77 m2, zone II 64\u00b72 m2, zone III 168\u00b73 m2, and zone IV 223\u00b79 m2. Zones I and II included seating areas (50 chairs in zone I and 26 chairs in zone II), where stable patients received treatment and waited for test results. Seriously ill patients, who required close observation and needed a designated bed, were moved to zone III (17 beds) or zone IV (23 beds). Zone IV was used for patients being admitted. Beds in zones III and IV were spaced roughly 1\u00b78 m apart, with curtains in between. Nurses were assigned to work in designated zones, whereas physicians and transfer agents took care of patients in several zones. All zones in the emergency room were covered by the same air handling units.",

The classic definitions of close contact as being within roughly 6 feet (1\u00b78 m) or within the same room or care area for a prolonged period of time were difficult to apply to an emergency room setting with high patient volumes, ongoing traffic within the emergency room and to and from the radiology suite, and large numbers of visitors and family members. We considered all patients who visited the emergency room during the stay of Patients 1 and 14 as exposed contacts, developed criteria for close contacts by expanding on the definitions of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),12 and categorised patients into different groups. Therefore, we could establish group-specific viral incubation periods and attack rates during the outbreak. In close contacts who stayed in the same zone, the incubation period was shorter and attack rate was higher than patients who stayed in different zones. Additionally, in zones III and IV, patients were infected even when they were separated by curtains most of the time and were apart as far as 6 m (for beds on either side of the nurse's station; figure 4). Similar to the SARS outbreak, we observed so-called super-spreaders among patients with MERS-CoV infection, and these super-spreaders can cause large outbreaks through several modes of transmission similar to those in the SARS outbreak.13 Among patients who stayed in various locations, those who overlapped with Patient 14 at the radiology suite or registration area had higher attack rates (5%) than the rest of the patients (1%), suggesting that transmission might occur by even brief exposures to recently contaminated objects or encounters with individuals carrying a super-spreader.",

Suspicion for unusual infections should be maintained if patients do not or cannot report accurate histories. Readiness of laboratory support is essential for initial investigation and for control of outbreaks, and overly rigorous requirements for laboratory testing have the potential to delay diagnosis and further spread disease. Hospital leadership needs to lead in preparedness for disaster management of high-risk communicable infectious diseases. Emergency preparedness at a national level and communication and support from government agencies are imperative to prevent and control any serious outbreak.",
