Therefore, it is critical to take steps to minimize risk to healthcare personnel during airway management by anesthesia team members.",

Practitioners practiced video laryngoscopy on an airway dummy torso model, as well as ventilation via bag-valve-mask and oral/nasal airway use (Note-ventilation may worsen aerosol generation and consideration should be given to avoid its use). Placement of laryngeal mask airways was also practiced in this simulated emergency environment. These scenarios allowed personnel to determine how to position the bed during intubation with a protective shield, how to manipulate either the plastic sheet or intubation box, as well as which movements would be allowed underneath these protective devices during intubation.",

Roles could include a designated \"spotter\" for PPE application, a handler of soiled/contaminated airway equipment, as well as a backup airway expert. Anesthesia faculty, CRNA's and anesthesia residents practiced how to maneuver both in emergent airway situations and in the operating room. We focused on assignment of roles (captain, spotter, who stayed uncontaminated) outside the patient's room before anyone came in contact with the patient. Furthermore, we made minimizing the number of healthcare workers exposed to the COVID-19 an additional goal.",

Simulation participants developed techniques to either keep the plastic sheet over the patient during extubation (shown in studies to be potentially effective [4] ), extubate immediately to a mask placed over the endotracheal tube, or re-apply the plastic intubation box over the patient prior to extubation.",
