The nucleus retains the genetic material for cell maintenance and replication, whereby efficient signal dependent targeting of cellular proteins into or out of the nucleus, mediated by the importin (IMP) superfamily of transporters (see Fig. 2; Section 2) is required for the cell to function. During infection by various viruses, specific viral-encoded gene products exploit the host cell nucleocytoplasmic trafficking machinery to enter and exit the nucleus as part of the strategy of the virus to evade the host immune response and replicate productively. Many of these viral proteins appear not only to possess targeting signals mediating high affinity interaction with the cellular nuclear transport factors, but also show precise regulation thereof by phosphorylation of these interactions by cellular/virally encoded kinases or other enzymes (see Section 3).",

The regulatory mechanisms and evidence for a physiologically important role in the viral infectious cycle will be discussed (Section 4), with the implication being that the regulation of viral protein nuclear import is crucial for many diverse viruses, thereby representing a potential target for the future development of anti-viral agents.",

            "text": "All transport into and out of the nucleus occurs through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), macromolecular structures (> 60 MDa) that span the double lipid bilayer of the nuclear envelope (NE) [1], [2], [3], [4]. There are approximately 2000 NPCs per \u201ctypical\u201d vertebrate cell, depending on the stage of the cell cycle and the cell type. NPC structure is typified by 8-fold symmetry, being made up of multiple proteins called nucleoporins (Nups) [5], [6], [7], [8] which occur in multiples of eight [9]. With the exception of certain peripheral, asymmetric Nups, most Nups localise on both sides of a symmetry axis in the plane of the NE [2], [9], and can be grouped into several classes based on homology and functional similarity [10], including (i) transmembrane Nups (i.e. POM121 and Gp210 in vertebrates), which anchor the NPC within the NE and are bound by (ii) structural Nups (c. 50% of all Nups), which contribute to the overall architecture of the NPC and represent the scaffold linking the transmembrane Nups and (iii) FG-Nups (c. 33% of all Nups/50% of the NPC mass), which are distinguished by the fact that they contain multiple FxFG (single letter amino acid code, where x is any amino acid) or GLFG motifs separated by varying numbers of charged or polar amino acids [2], [11]. Fig. 1\nshows the distribution of specific FG-Nups within the NPC, highlighting their position throughout the NPC. A number of studies indicate that FG-Nups are integral to bidirectional active transport through the NPC because of their ability to interact transiently with IMPs [9], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].",

In the case of nuclear import, release at the nuclear face requires Ran in its activated GTP-bound form to bind to the IMP\u03b2 to dissociate the import complex (Fig. 2\nleft). Nuclear export is analogous, where the EXP, only when in complex with RanGTP, recognises a NES within a cargo and forms a trimeric export complex (EXP/RanGTP/NES-cargo) that is able to translocate through the NPC through transient interactions with FG-Nups such as Nup98 [32] and the non-FG-Nup Tpr ([33]) on the nuclear side, and Nup214 [34] on the cytoplasmic side (see Fig. 1), where the complex is dissociated via GTP hydrolysis by Ran of GTP to GDP, facilitated by RanGTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) (Fig. 2 right) and Ran binding protein 1 (RanBP1) and/or the RanBP1-like domains of Nup358 [30].",

            "text": "Phosphorylation-mediated modulation of NLS/NES access, resulting in either inhibition (intramolecular masking) or enhancement of transport (see Fig. 3 and Table 1), is the most common means to regulate nuclear transport efficiency. The human T-cell leukaemia virus type 2 (HTLV-2) Rex protein (see Fig. 3) is an example; in its pre-mature (p24) form, the N-terminal IMP\u03b2-recognised NLS is masked [107], [108], [109], but upon phosphorylation of T164 by protein kinase CK1 (CK1)/glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) [107], S151/153 is subsequently phosphorylated by CK1 to produce the active p26 form of the protein with an accessible NLS [107], [108], [109]. In the case of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus LANA2 (latency-associated nuclear antigen 2), phosphorylation at T564 by Akt is believed to promote a conformational change that inhibits Crm1 binding to the NES [118]. A similar mechanism appears to apply to CAV VP3 (see Fig. 3) through the T108 phosphorylation site [114], [115], although phosphorylation in this case appears to only occur in transformed and not normal cells, making the nuclear targeting module of VP3 an exciting possibility for tumour-cell specific nuclear targeting. In the case of the SV40 T-ag protein, protein kinase CK2 (CK2) phosphorylation at S111/112 increases the affinity of recognition of the NLS by IMP\u03b1/\u03b21, thereby accelerating the nuclear import rate c. 50-fold; this can be further enhanced by phosphorylation of the double-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinase (dsDNA-PK) site S120, which facilitates phosphorylation at the CK2 site, as well as IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 recognition/nuclear import [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90]. In analogous fashion, HCMV ppUL44 is phosphorylated at S413 by CK2 to enable higher affinity recognition of the NLS by IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 and increased nuclear import (see Fig. 3; [23]), and a similar mechanism appears to apply to the Adenovirus E1a protein (see Fig. 3), where phosphorylation by Cdk1 at S89 enhances Crm1-mediated nuclear export [111].",

Inhibitor protein I-\u03baB is an example of a very specific cytoplasmic retention factor which binds to the NLS of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB p65 to prevent IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 interaction and thereby inhibit nuclear import. Upon activation of signal transduction, e.g. cytokine production during an immune response, I-\u03baB is phosphorylated and degraded to unmask the p65 NLS and enable nuclear import [126], [127]. An example of a more general cytoplasmic retention factor that affects nuclear import of a number of different NLS-containing proteins, including SV40 T-ag and HCMV ppUL44 [78] is BRCA1 associated protein 2 (BRAP2). Intermolecular masking of the T-ag NLS by BRAP2 is dependent on phosphorylation of T124 by Cdk1 adjacent to the NLS (see Fig. 3 and Table 1), whilst PKA/PKC mediated phosphorylation of T427 within the ppUL44 NLS similarly facilitates interaction with BRAP2 and cytoplasmic retention [78]. Cellular proteins such as p53 and p21cip\n[78], [128], [129], [130], [131], [132], [133] which possess NLSs and adjacent phosphorylation sites resembling those of SV40 T-ag and HCMV ppUL44 also appear to be able to be recognised by BRAP2 and inhibited in terms of nuclear import.",

Deletion/mutation of the CK2 site S111/112 to prevent phosphorylation decreased the import rate [88], whilst D112 substitution enhanced nuclear import [87], [160]; although S111 can function in its absence as a CK2 site, S112 is the main site of CK2 phosphorylation [87]. The mechanism of enhanced nuclear import through the CK2 site is through phosphorylation increasing the affinity of T-ag NLS recognition by the IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 heterodimer [85]. Negative charge at S120, the dsDNA-PK site, apart from facilitating CK2 phosphorylation at S111/112, also enhances IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 binding to the NLS [90]. That phosphorylation of S111/112 to enhance nuclear accumulation of T-ag is physiologically important in SV40 replication is indicated by the fact that viruses with mutations in the CK2 site (S112 and/or both S111/112) have markedly slower kinetics of DNA replication, and reduced viability (> 50%) [93], [148].",

Intriguingly, certain viruses have been shown to directly control CK2 localisation as well as up regulate its expression. During HSV-1 infection, for example, the ICP27 protein is known to recruit CK2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in a 3.5-fold increased CK2 activity by 6 h post infection that enhances cytoplasmic localisation of phosphorylated ICP27 and thereby facilitates its role in shuttling HSV mRNAs from the nucleus [163]. Analogously, CK2 appears to be recruited from subnuclear structures to regulate intranuclear transport of ribosomal RNA during Adenovirus infection [164]. The implication is that CK2 activity is integral to infection in the case of a number of viruses, with more examples of viruses using CK2 to modulate subcellular localisation likely to be identified in the near future.",

Although this has only been shown thus far for gene products from dsDNA viruses, it seems likely that this may apply to other viruses/viral gene products. The fact that BRAP2 may represent a general cellular defence mechanism to stem viral replication is an intriguing idea that warrants further investigation to examine its full potential as an anti-viral agent. It should not be ignored, however, that, as alluded to above, cytoplasmic retention of viral proteins until an optimal cell cycle/signal transduction state of the cell is attained is a strategy utilised by many viruses to facilitate rather than prevent virus production/infectivity etc. That virus replication is optimal at particular stages of the cell cycle has been shown for Hepatitis C, Epstein\u2013Barr Virus (EBV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), as well as HPV [166], [167], [168], [169], [170].",

Deletion or mutation of critical residues in the RbBS relieves inhibition of nuclear import for T-ag proteins carrying the RbBS, whilst cancer cells lacking functional p110Rb show no reduction in nuclear transport due to the RbBS.

            "text": "E1 is a 70 kDa site-specific ATP-dependent DNA helicase essential for virus replication, which is highly conserved amongst all HPV types, and is essential for viral replication and amplification [185], [186], [187]. Together with HPV E2 protein, which increases its affinity for DNA [188], [189], [190], [191], [192], [193], [194], E1 is able to bind to a specific binding element in the viral origin to act to facilitate origin DNA unwinding, recruit the host cell DNA polymerase \u03b1-primase complex, and thereby initiate viral DNA synthesis [195], [196], [197], [198], [199], [200], [201]. E1 performs its role in the nuclear compartment, which it accesses through a bipartite NLS (HPV-11 E1 83KRK/-/S89/-/S93/-/KKVKRR125\n[24]). Between the basic amino acids of the bipartite NLS is a potent NES (HPV-11 E1 97NVANAVESEIS\n107PRLDAIKL115\n[84]) that confers rapid export out of the nucleus through Crm1 [24], [84]. Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E1 is functionally homologous to HPV E1, being able to substitute for HPV E1 in replicating the HPV genome, and vice versa\n[185]. Although phosphorylation by Cdk2 at S-phase of the cell cycle promotes BPV E1 nuclear export via Crm1, where phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at S283 would appear to enable rapid nucleocytoplasmic shuttling [112], [113], Cdk phosphorylation appears to promote nuclear retention in the case of HPV-11 E1 [24], [84]. The presence of a NES in E1 presumably relates to the need for the virus to slow viral replication to establish a persistent infection in the basal keratinocytes and maintain low copy number by keeping the nuclear concentration of E1 low. Only once the basal cells differentiate and start to rise to the skin surface does E1 accumulate in the nucleus to enable HPV enter the vegetative stage of its life cycle, when the viral promoters are significantly up-regulated and late gene products produced to enable HPV to have the best chance to reinfect another host [170], [201], [202], [203], [204].",

            "text": "HPV E1 nuclear localisation is modulated by phosphorylation by MAPKs present in the cytoplasm, and Cdks in the nucleus, at specific stages of the cell cycle [24]. E1 has been shown to interact with several cyclin/Cdk complexes in vitro\n[68], [117], as well as directly with cyclin E [117], [205], an interaction that is essential for viral replication [117]. The N-terminal domain of E1 possesses a cyclin binding motif (RxL126) [117] as well as several Cdk phosphorylation sites, of which S89, S93 and S107 have been shown through mutational analysis to inhibit transient replication of viral origin-containing plasmids in transfected cells [117]. Phosphorylation of all three serines (see Fig. 5\n) appears to be required for efficient nuclear localisation that is dependent on active cyclin E/Cdk2 and/or cyclin A/Cdk2 at S107\n[24], [84], [117], and MAPKs (ERK/JNK) at S89/93\n[24]. S106 phosphorylation prevents Crm1 recognition of E1's NES [24], [84], whilst phosphorylation probably by MAPKs of S89 and S93 seems likely to facilitate recognition by IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 [24], probably in a manner similar to the effect of the CK2 sites near/within the NLSs of T-ag and ppUL44 (see Section 4.1.1; Fig. 4, Fig. 5).",

It would thus appear that precise regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HPV E1 is necessary in order to modulate the levels of E1 nuclear activity according to the differentiation state of the host cell; premature nuclear entry of E1 leading to virus production before the cell reaches the skin surface would be counterproductive, and so cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation appears to be exploited to HPV's advantage to fine tune the levels of E1 in the nucleus in order to optimise its chance of infecting a new host.",

            "text": "The key forms of RPP appear to be P1 (1\u2013297) and P3 (53\u2013297), which function predominantly in the cytoplasm and nucleus respectively, with the strong N-terminal NES (NES1) the main basis of predominantly cytoplasmic localisation of P1, in contrast to P3 that lacks it and is predominantly nuclear [120]. P1's key role is in the cytoplasm, both as a cofactor for replication, and as a binding partner of STAT-1 to prevent its role in IFN signalling, P3, however, can exist in either the nucleus, where its predominant role is to inhibit STAT-1 DNA binding activity, or in the cytoplasm, where, in a dimerised form, it prevents STAT-1 nuclear access by binding it and associating with MTs (Fig. 6\n). Multiple PKC sites [217] throughout RPP provide additional levels of control, the best understood of which is the PKC site at S210, which appears to function as a switch to inhibit the NLS (a.a. KKYK214 -/- R260) within the CTD [120], [122] and expose a second NES (NES2: NFEQLKM\n232) normally buried within the CTD (see Fig. 6). Whether other PKC sites (e.g. S63, S64 and S162) within RPP modulate MT interaction and/or regulate dimerisation of the RPP to enable the MT-dependent retention of associated STAT-1, is unknown at this stage. What is clear, however, is that RPP dimerisation is critical for STAT-1 cytoplasmic retention, since deletion of the self-association domain abolishes P3 MT association, instead facilitating MT-enhanced nuclear import via the DLC-AS [210], [216]; a heterologous dimerisation domain functionally can substitute for the RPP self-association domain to restore STAT-1 cytoplasmic retention [210].",

Intriguingly, 4 of a total of 7 amino acid substitutions in the Ni-CE strain, compared to that of Ni, are located within/near NES1 (see Section 4.3.1), correlating with the fact that the Ni-CE RPP P1 is more nuclear in infected cells than the Ni RPP, and thereby less able to prevent STAT-1 nuclear translocation in response to IFN\u03b1 treatment. The implication is that the RPP NES1 plays a critical role in infection by specifically antagonising STAT-1 nuclear translocation to activate IFN-stimulated genes [124], [210], [218].",

The cytoplasmic and nuclear localisation of the gene products appears to be crucial to inhibit STAT-1 activities by directly interacting with STAT-1 and preventing its activation [207], [220]; W protein is found in the nucleus and V and P found in the cytoplasm [207], [221]. Nipah produces V and W in addition to the full length P protein to target STAT-1, with the varying forms acting in the cytoplasm and nucleus combining to effect inhibition of the innate immune response pathway. RV and Nipah and presumably other viruses thus utilise multiple forms of the same gene product to target STAT-1 in either the cytoplasm or nucleus to prevent the up-regulation of IFN-stimulated genes and thereby dampen the innate immune response. That STAT-1 is a target for many different viruses is known e.g. the V protein of measles [222], [223], [224] and rinderpest [225] viruses also binds STAT-1 to inhibit anti-viral responses. Clearly, perturbing the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling ability of the key viral proteins that sequester STAT-1 in nucleus/cytoplasm would represent an important step towards preventing viral evasion of the innate immune system, as would preventing interaction of STAT-1 with the viral proteins themselves.",

            "text": "Precise regulation of the function of specific viral proteins is central to viral replication and pathogenesis, and as discussed here, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking plays a critical role in the case of many DNA and even RNA viruses (see Table 1). Phosphorylation appears to be the main mechanism by which viral protein nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is regulated during the virus life cycle, involving various cellular kinases as well as virally encoded kinases. The ubiquitously expressed CK2 enhances nuclear localisation of specific proteins involved in replication in the case of DNA tumour viruses such as SV40 and HCMV, whilst Cdks have been shown to play a crucial role in maintaining a persistent HPV infection in the skin through modulating E1 localisation; viruses that encode their own kinases such as VZV (ORF66, see Table 1) are less reliant on cellular kinases for control over subcellular localisation. Clearly, targeting the activity of kinases, such as CK2 and Cdk in order to perturb viral protein subcellular trafficking using specific inhibitors, represents a potential anti-viral strategy, although hampered by the obvious problem of effects on normal cellular functions of conventional kinase inhibitors. Screening for and/or developing compounds that block the nuclear transport of specific viral proteins though disrupting their interaction with IMP/EXPs seems an intriguing alternative, whereby a counter screening approach could be used to discard inhibitors of general host protein\u2013IMP interaction, in order to identify inhibitors specific to IMP\u2013viral protein interaction without affecting cellular proteins (Wagstaff et al., manuscript in preparation). Along similar lines, a unique approach would be to screen for compounds that stabilise or enhance the interaction with negative regulators of nuclear import such as BRAP2 with the SV40 T-ag or HCMV ppUL44 proteins or p110Rb with SV40 T-ag etc., as a means to inhibit viral protein nuclear import and thereby virus production.",

The IMP/cargo complexes then dock onto the cytoplasmic side of the NPC (2a and 2b), followed by passage to the nuclear side of the NPC, through sequential, transient interactions of the IMP\u03b2 with the FG-Nups that make up the NPC (3a and 3b). Once within the nucleus, RanGTP binding to IMP\u03b2 disassociates the complex (4a and 4b) to release the NLS-containing cargo into the nucleus to perform its function. In analogous fashion to nuclear import, transport of NES-containing cargo proteins (1c) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is mediated by EXPs which recognise the NES, dependent on RanGTP binding to the EXP. The EXP/RanGTP/cargo complex docks at the nuclear side of the NPC (2c), before passing to the cytoplasmic side of NPC through sequential, transient interactions of the EXP with the FG-Nups (3c). Once within the cytoplasm, RanGAP1 (RanGTPase-activating protein 1) and RanBP1 facilitate hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by Ran (4c), thereby dissociating cargo from the EXP.",

In intramolecular masking (1) IMPs/EXPs are prevented from binding the NLS/NES of the cargo by masking of the NLS/NES by sequences within the same protein. This is exemplified by (a) the human T-cell leukaemia virus type 2 (HTLV-2) Rex protein in its inactive p24 form, where specific phosphorylation by CK1/GSK3 at T164 and subsequent phosphorylation at S151/153 are required for IMP\u03b2 recognition of the NLS, and (b) the VZV IE62, where phosphorylation at S686 by the VZV kinase ORF66 inhibits nuclear import by impairing recognition by IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 [97]. Examples of intramolecular masking in nuclear export are shown for (c) HPV E1, where Cdk mediated phosphorylation of S107 prevents Crm1 binding, resulting in nuclear retention [24], [84], and (d) CAV VP3, where phosphorylation of T108 specifically in cancer cells prevents nuclear export [114], [115]. In intermolecular masking (2), NLSs/NESs are masked from IMPs/EXPs binding by a heterologous protein/molecule. An example in the case of nuclear import is the cytoplasmic protein BRAP2 which, dependent on Cdk phosphorylation of T124, prevents recognition by IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 of the SV40 T-ag NLS, a similar mechanism dependent on protein kinase C phosphorylation of T427 applies to HCMV ppUL44 protein (not shown) [78]. Enhanced nuclear import/export can occur through posttranslational modification enhancing NLS/NES recognition by IMP/EXP. An example (3a) is the increase in the affinity of binding of IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 to the NLSs of HCMV ppUL44 and SV40 T-ag (not shown) by CK2 phosphorylation (of S413 and S111/112 respectively) leading to enhanced nuclear import [23], [85], [87]. In the case of nuclear export (3b), Cdk1/Cdk2 mediated phosphorylation of S89 enhances recognition of the Adenovirus type 5 E1a NES by Crm1, leading to more efficient nuclear export [111].",

The T-ag NLS alone mediates IMP\u03b1/\u03b21-mediated nuclear import, relatively inefficiently (black dotted arrow \u2014 1a), but upon phosphorylation at serine111/112 by CK2 (blue arrow), IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 is able to bind the T-ag NLS c. 50-fold better, to facilitate subsequent efficient nuclear import (1b). Phosphorylation at serine106 by GSK3/CK1 (blue arrow) allows p110Rb to bind T-ag at the RbBS, which leads to cytoplasmic retention and decreased nuclear import (1c). Phosphorylation at threonine124 by Cdk1 (blue arrow) allows BRAP2 to bind the T-ag NLS to prevent IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 binding through intermolecular masking, and sequester T-ag in the cytoplasm (1d). (2a) HCMV ppUL44 IMP\u03b1/\u03b21-mediated NLS-dependent nuclear import is inefficient (black dotted arrow) but upon phosphorylation at serine413 by CK2 (blue arrow), IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 is able to bind the ppUL44 NLS with greater affinity to facilitate efficient nuclear import (2b). Phosphorylation at Thr427 by PK-C (blue arrow), enhances binding of ppUL44 to BRAP2 to prevent IMP\u03b1/\u03b21 binding through intermolecular masking, and sequester ppUL44 in the cytoplasm and prevent nuclear import. Since ppUL44 may play a role in piggy-backing the HCMV proteins pUL54 and ppUL114 proteins into the nucleus early in infection, the various regulating mechanisms may apply to nuclear import of multiple HCMV proteins.",

In the absence of phosphorylation, P3 localises efficiently in the nucleus (1) through its NLS and the dynein light chain association sequence (DLC-AS), which confers binding to the microtubule (MT) motor dynein that acts to enhance IMP facilitated transport to the nucleus, where its role is to prevent DNA binding activity by the STAT-1 signalling molecule. P3 remains in the nucleus because NES2 is inaccessible (2a) until PKC phosphorylation of S210 induces conformation changes to render NES2 accessible to Crm1 (and mask the NLS) to permit Crm1 recognition and nuclear export (2b). Upon oligomerisation and binding to MTs through a MT-associating sequence (MT-AS) distinct from the DLC-AS, P3 remains cytoplasmic, acting to retain STAT-1 in the cytoplasm bound to MTs (3) and prevent its action in the anti-viral response.",
