            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses which included in three different antigenic groups. CoVs infecting dogs comprise canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV) (Enjuanes et al., 2000) and the newly recognised canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Erles et al., 2003, Decaro et al., 2007a), belonging to group 1 and group 2 CoVs, respectively. Two CCoV genotypes have been identified so far, namely CCoV type I and CCoV type II, which are responsible for the occurrence enteritis in dogs and are frequently associated in mixed infections (Pratelli et al., 2004, Decaro et al., 2005c). Although its tropism is restricted to the gastroenteric tract, CCoV has been recently associated to systemic disease followed by fatal outcome in pups (Buonavoglia et al., 2006). Severe clinical signs were observed in the affected pups, whereas necropsy examination revealed remarkable gross lesions in lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys. Virological and bacteriological investigations failed to detect common canine pathogens. Unexpectedly, CCoV type II RNA was detected at very high titres in the internal organs of the dead pups and the virus (strain CB/05) was isolated on canine cell cultures. The association of strain CB/05 to a severe, sometimes fatal disease of dogs, together with the isolation of the virus from organs with severe lesions, strongly suggests that CCoV has changed its tropism, acquiring the ability to spread from the enteric tract to the internal organs (Decaro et al., 2007b).",

All inoculated dogs were successfully infected, as shown by the occurrence of faecal shedding, seroconversion and severe clinical signs.

The pantropism of the virus was confirmed by the presence of gross lesions in the internal organs of the dead dogs, as well as by the detection of viral RNA in those tissues. Interestingly, CCoV RNA was detected also in the brain of the dead dogs. In contrast, enteric CCoV has been never associated to systemic infection, although the virus has been isolated previously from some tissues (tonsils, lungs and liver) of experimentally infected pups (Tennant et al., 1991).",

Thus, at this moment, the mechanisms of lymphopenia and viral spread to internal organs remained unknown.

Dogs inoculated oronasally with CB-05 strain were monitored for up to 21 days for total WBC, lymphocyte and polymorphocyte counts (top graphs). In addition, fever, viral RNA shed in faeces and clinical score where determined (bottom graphs). Total WBC, lymphocyte and polymorphocyte counts are presented as percentages of the cell counts determined at day 0. Viral RNA titres as determined by real-time RT-PCR are expressed as log copy numbers (log10) per \u03bcl of template. Clinical scores were calculated as shown in Table 1 and are reported for each day in correspondence of the temperature curves.",
