She was closely monitored, and on day 9 post birth she exhibited intermittent hyperpnoea with mild intercostal retractions and 2 self-limited episodes of oxygen desaturation during deep sleep and feeding. A capillary sample was obtained for blood gas analysis, which revealed transient mild acidosis (pH, 7.27; pCO2, 49 mmHg; bicarbonate, 22 mEq/L; base excess -4; normal lactate), a chest radiograph detected ground glass opacities mainly in the right perihilar region and the serum level of C-reactive protein was normal (0.06 mg/dL). After 24 h, the symptoms resolved, and the patient has remained asymptomatic to date (day 13 post birth), when the COVID-19 RT-PCR has been repeated and continues to be positive.
