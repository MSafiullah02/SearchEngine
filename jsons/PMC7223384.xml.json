            "text": "Fluid overload in critically ill patients is defined as a 10% increase in cumulative fluid balance (CFB) from baseline body weight and represents a well-known problem which detrimentally affects intensive care unit (ICU) patient\u2019s clinical course and their outcome [1\u20133]. Therefore, timely recognition and correction of fluid overload, or even better, identification of patients at risk for fluid accumulation in an early stage is of great importance. However, this remains challenging in clinical practice, as we miss an accurate and reliable tool for correct assessment of fluid status [4]. Current methods include the calculation of daily and CFB, by recording fluid inputs and outputs, the use of clinical or biochemical signs of fluid overload, monitoring filling pressures, however, none of these methods allow for a close monitoring for fluid balance, and intercompartmental fluid shifts [1, 5].",

Indeed, several data published in the last decade suggest that BIA may provide useful information not only in different well-established patient groups (dialysis, AIDS, malnutrition), but also in critically ill patients with burns, trauma or sepsis undergoing fluid resuscitation. This tool may offer a non-invasive, fast and reliable assessment of volume status and fluid distribution as well as evaluation of dynamic changes in fluid distribution. It measures total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), and intracellular water (ICW). BIA can calculate absolute fluid overload (AFO), the difference between normal, expected ECW and the actual, measured ECW, expressed in liters, as well as relative fluid overload (RFO), AFO/ECW, expressed in percentages. BIA measurements may be performed easily at the bedside, do not require extensive training and have limited inter-observer variations [22]. Thereby, BIA sounds as a promising diagnostic tool in the ICU or operating room to assess fluid status. Recently, new BIA-devices have been introduced allowing not only calculation of TBW, ECW and ICW but also the intra- and extravascular fluids (IVF, EVF) and, in case of dialysis, Kt/V (Fig. 1).",

Their study highlights an important clinical problem, fluid overload assessment, in a field that lacks clinical data. The study population was appropriate as abdominal surgery is among the most common elective surgical procedures [24]. The results confirm the potential role and usefulness of BIA monitoring to quantify body fluid composition and intercompartmental shifts in a major abdominal surgery perioperative setting. In this study 71 adult patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery were included. Patients were then divided in two subgroups according to the presence of pre- and postoperative cumulative fluid overload (CFO): Normal Hydration (NH) subgroup with CFO < 5%, and Fluid Overload (FO) subgroup with CFO > = 5%. The authors found some differences between the subgroups regarding peroperative and postoperative parameters like median surgery duration and mean fluid infusion rate, amongst others. Positive intraoperative fluid balance (2.4 \u00b1 1.0 L) resulted in a significant increase of TBW (1.4 \u00b1 2.4 L) and of ECW (1.4 \u00b1 1.2 L). Intraoperative fluid balance significantly correlated with TBW change (r = 0.23, p = 0.04) and with AFO change (r = 0.31, p < 0.01). A significant correlation was found between pre- and postoperative AFO and RFO on one hand, and ICU-LOS on the other. In addition, we would like to provide some additional comments as food for further thought.",

A drop of serum albumin levels in the early postoperative period is known to be multifactorial: altered metabolism, blood loss/dilution and capillary leakage-related redistribution into the third space [25\u201329]. The latter being probably the most important mechanism [25], which may account for > 75% of albumin decrease in the early postoperative phase. This significant parameter also appears to be related to the magnitude of postsurgical systemic inflammatory response [26, 27], which, in turn, is directly related to the extent of surgery [25] and is believed to contribute to the risk of developing postoperative complications [28, 29]. Labgaa et al. [25] identified a serum albumin decrease \u2265 10 g/L on postoperative day 1 after elective abdominal surgery to be independently associated with a threefold increased risk for postoperative complications. Therefore, we believe that serum albumin drop in FO subgroup not only mirrors a higher intraoperative fluid regimen but may also indicates a more pronounced postsurgical systemic inflammatory response in those patients.",

Indeed, even if blood loss was the same in both subgroups, FO patients received significantly more colloid infusion. Data on the inotropic and vasoactive medication use were collected but are not presented in the paper. One could expect more vasopressors in the FO subgroup. However, in order to maintain patient\u2019s blood pressure peroperatively, one can give intravenous fluid infusion or choose vasopressor drugs. Both strategies being widely accepted in clinical practice. Unfortunately, little is known about the fluid management protocol, or whether it recommends early or late use of vasopressors? Even if fluid overload is known to impair the patient's clinical course in view of aforementioned comments, the greater rate of postoperative respiratory dysfunction and longer ICU stay in FO patients [30\u201332] seen in the work of Ciumanghel et al., may not be explained only by the presence of fluid overload [23].",

Moreover, the preoperative AFO and RFO values (more refined BIA parameters not related to body weight or height) were significantly higher in FO group.
