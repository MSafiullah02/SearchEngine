Invasive aspergillosis is also associated with very high mortality rates in ICU (see below). In several studies, admission to ICU in the early stages of sepsis or other acute event was associated with better survival than admission later, after development of organ dysfunction. Performance status is perhaps the most important and only variable relating to the underlying condition that is correlated with ICU death. The prognosis remains guarded for certain cancer patients, including patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with active uncontrolled graft versus host disease, those with relapse of the primary disease after allogeneic HSCT and special cases of solid cancer including pulmonary carcinomatous lymphangitis and carcinomatous meningitis with coma [ 9 ] . An \"ICU trial\" consisting of patient admission and re-assessment after 3-5 days has been suggested for cancer patients [ 9 ] . Outcomes were better associated with the hemodynamic and respiratory status after the fi rst stabilization phase than at the time of admission. Another study supporting this concept showed that organ failure scores predicted survival more accurate on day six than at admission [ 7 ] . All patients who required initiation of mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or dialysis after 3 days in the ICU died.",

Pulmonary and intracerebral hemorrhage are frequent terminal events in these patients and prophylactic transfusions may prevent mortality. Neutrophil transfusions have not been shown to improve survival for patients with severe neutropenia as part of the management of acute infections. However, when sub-grouped according to the dose of neutrophils transfused, survival was improved with average neutrophil doses of 1 \u00d7 10 10 . This dose can be obtained by pre-treating donors with granulocyte growth stimulating factors (G-CSF) [ 14 ] . Neutrophil transfusions should be reserved for severely neutropenic patients (<100/ ml 3 ) for whom the neutrophil count is expected to increase in a few days, as a bridge until bone marrow reconstitution.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed the epidemiology of HIV such that the latter group of patients is rare nowadays in locations where treatment is available (and depending on patient's compliance). Clearly, the change in prognosis of HIV with HAART has led to a shift in management such that HIV patients are offered maximal treatment, including full ICU support, organ transplantation in the appropriate circumstances, or chemotherapy if needed. The impact of HAART availability on mortality has been shown also in ICU, where predictors of mortality in the HAART era are no longer HIV-related [ 18 ] .

Because of the ominous prognosis combinations of antifungals have been suggested as primary or salvage therapy. In one small randomized controlled trial, the combination of liposomal amphotericin B with caspofungin resulted in a higher rate of favorable response than liposomal amphotericin B, with no deaths in the combination arm (0/15 vs. 3/15 with monotherapy [ 47 ] .

CMV antigenemia was tested after neutropil recovery (the pp65 antigen is present in neutrophils which are required for CMV antigenemia assessment) and was negative. Direct immuno fl uorescence and PCR for P. jirovecii in BAL fl uid were negative. Lung biopsy demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage with eosinophlic alveolar foam compatible with PCP. A methamine-silver and immunohistochemical stains for PCP were negative, as was the immunohistochemical stain for CMV. The patient was diagnosed with PCP based on the clinical presentation and histological Sensitivity and speci fi city values refer to the diagnosis of probable or proven IA GM galactomannan, CI con fi dence interval a Values refer to a GM cut-off of 0.5 optical density index fi ndings. CMV co-infection could not be ruled out. The positive CMV culture in BAL fl uid could re fl ect CMV reactivation and infection in the presence of immune suppression, without disease. 2. The patient was empirically treated with high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and intravenous gancyclovir with no adverse events and these were continued after the results of the tests discussed above. 3. The dose of prednisone was increased and tapered down following the recommendations for severe PCP. 4. Respiratory insuf fi ciency improved gradually until the patient was discharged with normal saturation on room air. Notable was the appearance of pulmonary in fi ltrates and respiratory distress only after neutrophil recovery, although fever started during neutropenia and probably re fl ected the same infection. This exacerbation after neutrophil recovery is similar to the immune reconstitution syndrome seen with HIV patients after start of HAART.",
