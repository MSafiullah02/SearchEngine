            "text": "Since the emerging of the \"novel coronavirus\" SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding respiratory disease COVID-19, the virus has spread all over the world. In Europe, Germany is currently one of the most affected countries. In March 2020, a \"lockdown\" was established to contain the virus spread, including the closure of schools and child day care facilities as well as forced social distancing and bans of any public gathering. The present study attempts to analyze whether these governmental interventions had an impact on the declared aim of \"flattening the curve\", referring to the epidemic curve of new infections. This analysis is conducted from a regional perspective. On the level of the 412 German counties, logistic growth models were estimated based on reported cases of infections, aiming at determining the regional growth rate of infections and the point of inflection where infection rates begin to decrease and the curve flattens. All German counties exceeded the peak of new infections between the beginning of March and the middle of April. In a large majority of German counties, the epidemic curve has flattened before the social ban was established (March 23). In a minority of counties, the peak was already exceeded before school closures. The growth rates of infections vary spatially depending on the time the virus emerged. Counties belonging to states which established an additional curfew show no significant improvement with respect to growth rates and mortality. On the contrary, growth rates and mortality are significantly higher in Bavaria compared to whole Germany. The results raise the question whether social ban measures and curfews really contributed to the curve flattening. Furthermore, mortality varies strongly across German counties, which can be attributed to infections of people belonging to the \"risk group\", especially residents of retirement homes.",

Ben-Israel (2020) found a decline of new infection cases on the national level regardless of the Corona measures.

We therefore focus 1) the regional growth speed of the pandemic and 2) the time when exponential growth ends and the infection rate decreases again. Apart from that, only infection cases and some further information are available, but not additional epidemiological information. Thus, the method of choice is a phenomenological regression model. In an early phase of an epidemic, when the number of infected individuals growths exponentially, an exponential function could be utilized for the phenomenological analysis (Ma 2020) . However, the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany is demonstrably not of exponential nature anymore, as the number of infections and the corresponding reproduction number is decreasing (Robert Koch Institut 2020a). Thus, a logistic growth model is used for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 growth in the German counties. The following representations of the logistic growth model are adopted from Batista (2020a), Chowell et al. (2014) and Tsoularis (2002) . Unlike exponential growth, logistic growth includes two stages, while assuming a saturation effect. The first stage is characterized by an exponential growth of infections due to an unregulated spreading of the disease. However, as more infections accumulate, the number of at-risk susceptible persons decreases because of immunization, death, or behavioral changes as well as public health interventions. After the inflection point of the infection curve, when the infection rate is as its maximum, the growth decreases and the cumulative number of infections approximate its theoretical maximum, which is the saturation value (see figure 1 ).",

Taking into account incubation period and reporting delay, there is an average all-over delay between infection and reporting of about 12 days (see figure 2 ). But this is just one side of the coin, as an inspection of the case data reveals that this delay differs between case characteristics (age group, sex) and counties. In their current prognosis, the RKI estimates the dates of onset of symptoms by Bayesian nowcasting outgoing from the reporting date, but not taking into account the incubation time. The RKI nowcasting model incorporates delays of reporting depending on age group and sex, but not including spatial (county-specific) effects (an der Heiden, Hamouda 2020). Exploring the dataset used here, we see obvious differences in the reporting delay with respect to age groups and sex. There seems to be a tendency of lower reporting delays for young children and older infected individuals (see table 3 ). Taking a look at the delays between onset of symptoms and reporting date on the level of the 412 counties (not shown in table), the values range between 2.39 days (W\u00fcrzburg city) and 17.0 days (W\u00fcrzburg county).",

The first conclusion with respect to the national level is that the flattening of the epidemic curve in Germany occurred between three to six days before forced social distancing and ban of gatherings, which are attributed to phase 3 of measures in this study, came into force. Due to this temporal mismatch, the decline of infections can not be causally linked to the contact ban of March 23. Note that the results for whole Germany, estimating the inflection point between March 17 and March 20, are rather conservative even when compared with the RKI estimations. In the RKI nowcasting study, the peak of onset of symptoms (not infection time, which is not considered in the mentioned study) is found at March 18 and a stabilization of the reproduction number equal to R = 1 at March 22 (an der Heiden, Hamouda 2020).

The second conclusion is that in all German counties the curves of infections clearly flattened within a time period of about six weeks from the first to the last county. On average, it took one month from the first infection to the inflection point of the curve. However, the regional decline of infections is not in line with the governmental interventions to contain the virus spread. In nearly two thirds of the German counties which account for two thirds of the German population, the flattening of the infection curve occured before the social ban with forced social distancing etc. came into force (March 23, phase 3). One in eight counties experienced a decline of infections even before the closure of schools, child day care facilities and retail facilities, which is attributed to phase 2 of interventions in this study. Consequently, the third conclusion is that in a majority of counties, the regional decline of infections can not be attributed to the contact ban. In a minority of counties, also closures of educational and retail facilities cannot have caused the decline. While keeping in mind that SARS-CoV-2 emerged at different times across the counties, the fourth conclusion is that it is at least questionable whether these measures primarily caused the flattening of the infection curve in the other counties.",

In the other states with curfews, Saarland and Saxony, no clear effects could be identified, especially with respect to mortality which does not differ significantly from other states.

Some actions against virus spread were already established in the first half of March, e.g. the cancellation of some large events or \"ghost games\" in soccer. These early measures could have contributed to curve flattening. Also, the domestic quarantine of infected persons (which is the default procedure in the case of infectious diseases) has helped to decrease new infections. In Heinsberg county, about 1,000 people were in domestic quarantine at the end of February 2020, which could explain the early curve flattening in this Corona \"hotspot\".",

Fourth, we have to keep in mind that all data related to infections/diseases used here underestimate the real amount of infected individuals in Germany as well as in nearly all countries in which the Coronavirus emerged. Typically, suspected cases with COVID-19 symptoms are tested, leading to a heavy underestimation of infected people without symptoms. In other words, the tests are targeted at the disease (COVID-19), not the virus (SARS-CoV-2). Several recent studies have tried to estimate the real prevalence of virus and/or the infection fatality rate (IFR), including all infected cases rather than the confirmed (see table 9 ). Estimated rates of underascertainment (estimate PRV/reported PRV) lie between 5 (Gangelt, Germany) and 50-85 (Santa Clara County, USA). Obviously, when estimated CFR values exceed the estimated IFR values by ten times or more, there must be a large amount of unreported cases. The logical consequence is that the absolute number of susceptible individuals at-risk of infection decreases because of many infected persons not knowing that they have been infected (and probably immunized) in the past. Quantifying the \"dark figure\" of SARS-CoV-2 infections by using representative sample-based tests on current infection as well as seroprevalence will be a challenge in the near future. Fifth, there is another possible epidemiological reason for curve flattening with or without a \"lockdown\". Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly infective, the \"Heinsberg study\" by Streeck et al. (2020) found a relatively low secondary infection risk (\"secondary attack rate\", SAR). Infected persons did not even infect other household members in the majority of cases. The authors conjecture that this could be due to a present immunity (T helper cell immunity) not detected as positive in the test procedure. In a current virological study, 34% of test persons who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 had relevant helper cells because of earlier infections with other harmless Coronaviruses causing common colds (Braun et al. 2020) . If this explanation proves correct, the absolute number of susceptible individuals at-risk of infection would have been substantially lower already at the beginning of the pandemy. Cross protection due to related virus strains has been determined e.g. with respect to influenza viruses (Broberg et al. 2020 ).",

            "text": "Finally, it is necessary to take a look at the informative value of the data on reported cases of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 used here. While several statistical uncertainties have been addressed by estimating the dates of infection in the present study, the method of data collection has not been made a subject of discussion. The confirmed cases of infections reported from regional health departments to the RKI result from SARS-CoV-2 tests conducted in the case of specific symptoms and/or on spec. When aggregating the reported cases to time series and analyzing their temporal evolvement, it is implictly assumed that the amount of tests remains the same over time. However, the number of tests was increased enormously during the pandemic -which is to be welcomed from the point of view of public health. From a statistic perspective, it might cause a bias because an increase in testing must result in an increase of reported infections, as a larger share of infections are revealed. In his statistical study, Kuhbandner (2020) argues that the detected SARS-CoV-2 pandemic growth is mainly due to increased testing, leading to the conclusion that \"the scenario of a pandemic spread of the Coronavirus in based on a statistical fallacy\". To confirm or deny this conclusion is not subject of the present study. However, taking a look at the conducted tests per calendar week (see figure 14 ) reveals weekly differences in the amount of tests. From calendar week 11 to 12, there has been an increase of conducted tests from 127,457 (5.9 % positive) to 348,619 (6.8 % positive), which means a raise by factor 2.7. The maximum of tests was conducted in CW 14 (408,348 with 9.0 % positive results), decreasing beyond that time, rising again in CW 17. The absolute number of positive tests is reflected plausibly in the number of reported cases (green line), as the confirmed cases result from the tests. The most estimated infections occurred in CW 11 and 12, showing again the delay between infection and case confirmation. Apart from the fact that excessive testing is probably the best strategy to control the spread of a virus, the resulting statistical data may suffer from underestimation and overestimation, dependent on which time period is regarded.",

The upper bound shows the counterpart. On condition of the upper bound, the inflection point is already on March 19. Using the higher values of incubation period estimated byBacker et al. (2020), the upper bound results in an inflection point at March 17, while the lower bound variant leads to the turn on March 20 (seetable 5).
