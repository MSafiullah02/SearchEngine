In the case of viruses, the search for antiviral agents involves additional difficulties, particularly due to the nature of the infectious viral agents. Thus, many compounds that may cause the death of viruses are also very likely to injure the host cell that haibours them. Natural products are increasingly appreciated as leads for drug discovery and development. Screening studies have been carried out in order to find antiviral agents from natural sources, and the occurrence of antiviral activity in extracts of plants, marine organisms and fungi is frequent. The evidence indicates that there may be numerous potentially usefiil antiviral phytochemicals in nature, waiting to be evaluated and exploited. In addition, other plants, not previously utilized medicinally, may also reveal antivirals. Among natural antiviral agents, recent investigations have reconsidered the interest of phyto-polysaccharides, which act as potent inhibitors of different viruses. This chapter will illustrate a variety of antiviral polysaccharides from natural sources since 1990, with the aim of making this matter more accessible to drug development",

Most successful anti-infective agents inhibit essential steps in metabolic processes required by the pathogen but absent in the host. Hov^ever, viruses cannot replicate independently. They must enter cells and use the cellular energy-generating, DNA-or RNAreplicating and protein-synthesizing pathways of the host to achieve viral replication. For this reason, in the case of viruses the search for antiviral agents is very hard since metabolic differences are not available: viruses utilize the host's protein synthesis leaving only some aspects of nucleic acid synthesis and macromolecule processing distinct from the host's metabolism.",

Besides the classical applications of these biopolymers in industry and pharmaceutical practice, the relatively new field of pharmacologically active polymers will be discussed. PS from plants and other natural sources have long been known to exert antitumour, immunomodulatory, anticoagulant and other types of biological activity, including antiviral activity.

Recent efforts have been directed at the development of polysaccharidic molecules as selective inhibitors of different classes of viruses [9, 10] . In this search, the following molecular targets were envisaged: for DNA viruses in general, the viral DNA polymerase; for herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus, the viral DNA polymerase via a specific phosphorylation by the viral 2'deoxythymidine kinase; for (+/-) RNA and (-) RNA viruses, Sadenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, a key enzyme in transmethylation reactions required for the maturation of viral mRNA; for retroviruses, reverse transcriptase as an initiator of virus replication and/or cell transformation; and for several enveloped viruses (e.g., retro-, herpes-and rhabdoviruses), virus adsorption to the outer cell membrane. This review deals with antiviral PS compiled from several sources during the past decade. Under the respective titles, we offer some brief descriptions of the most important global viral infections that are caused either by individual viruses or by groups of related viruses. They are restricted to those generally considered important in human and veterinary medicine and about which reports on active antiviral PS are recorded in the literature.",

In 1996, the number of AIDS infections was 23 million and 1.5 million people (half of them in Africa) were killed by this disease worldwide. In order to combat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS, enormous amounts of time and money have been dedicated to research into compounds which can be developed as therapeutic agents. HIV is a lentivirus which replicates within critical cells of the immune system, particularly CD4 T-cells and monocyte/macrophages, leading to a progressive loss of helper T-cells and profound immunosuppression. This condition is known as AIDS. Without treatment, the CD4 T-lymphocytes of an infected patient are reduced markedly so that the patient is susceptible to a wide range of opportunistic infections, and ultimately dies. Since this retrovirus, designated HIV, has been clearly identified as the primary cause of this disease, numerous compounds, also including plant-derived substances, have been evaluated for their inhibitory effects on HIV replication in vitro. Furthermore, many plant products are being used by patients with AIDS in some countries without any scientific proof that they possess anti-HIV activity.",

Carbohydrates were among the natural molecules capable of treating HIV infection. Various PS, including sulphated PS, have been found to be anti-HIV active substances of many antivirally active plant extracts, all of which are medicinal plants used in traditional medicine as anti-infectives. For example, a PS (MAR-10) was isolated from the aqueous extract of the plant Hyssop officinalis L., which was found to inhibit HIV-1 replication as demonstrated by the inhibition of HIV-1 p24 antigen and syncytia formation [20] . From Aspalathos linearis Burm., a popular medicinal plant in South Africa, Europe and Japan, a PS with strong anti-HIV activity was isolated [21, 22] . This compound almost completely inhibited the binding of HIV-1 to MT-4 cells. The major sugar components of this purified PS were found to be glucose, galactose, mannose and xylose. Premanathan et al [23, 24] investigated the PS extracted from Rizophora apiculata Blume and Rizophora mucronata Poir. in cell culture systems for their activity against human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV), Both compounds inhibited HIV-1, HIV-2 or SIV strains in various cell cultures and assay systems.

The most notable difference between HIV replication and other retroviruses is the intricate control of HIV gene expression by viral and cellular factors [29] . Possible mechanisms by which HIV kills infected cells include the formulation of multinucleate syncytia, cytopathic components within the virions themselves, and interaction between viral envelope proteins and the CD4 molecule on the cell surface. Three HIV enzymes are essential to the life cycle of the virus: HIV reverse transcriptase is crucial for viral replication; HIV protease processes viral polyproteins into fonctional enzymes and structural proteins, thereby facilitating maturation and infectivity of the virion particles; HIV integrase mediates HIV integration into the host chromosome. The chemotherapeutic strategies have therefore been focused on the development of inhibitors of these retroviral enzymes. Recently, it has been reported that biological membranes arising from HIV-induced cell fusion, as well as syncytium formation between infected and non-infected cells are interesting approaches in research for a new HIV therapy [30] .",

The inhibitory effect of dextran sulphate and its congeners on viral binding, viral replication and syncytium formation appears to be mediated by a specific interaction with the V3 region of gpl20.

It should be noted that sulphated PS owe their anti-HIV activity to the presence of the sulphate groups, which in turn are responsible for the inhibition of virus-cell binding. Dextran is a highmolecular-weight PS consisting predominantly of a (1 -> 6) linked Dglucose units. Dextrans can differ in chain length and in degree of branching. The branching occurs via a (1 ^3) and a (1 -> 4) branch points. Dextran fractions of different average molecular weight were obtained by partial hydrolysis. These different fractions were sulphated to obtain dextran sulphates of different molecular weight.",

The most pronounced anti-HIV activity was observed with 30% succinylated standard heparin and 100% succinylated low molecular weight heparin. Similarly, and in order to increase the ratio of anti-HIV activity to anticoagulant activity, selectively substituted sulphated PS with OH and/or COOH groups were chemically prepared [54, 55] . This group comprises a family of heterogeneous carbohydrates composed of long, unbranched PS modified, for example, by sulphations and acetylations. The acetylated derivatives are more active as inhibitors of HIV-induced giant-cell formation. Furthermore, several soluble derivatized dextrans with different percentages of carbomethyl, benzylamide and sulphonate/sulphate groups were also evaluated for possible inhibitory effects on HIV-1 infection, and from the results obtained, their use as anti-HIV therapeutic agents can be proposed [56] .",

For example, fucoidan, a complex sulphated PS from the alga Fucus vesiculosus L. was found to inhibit HIV in vitro, presumably through a direct interaction of the PS with the HIV binding site of the target cells [60] . The aqueous-soluble extracts from this alga, a common littoral alga of the coast of the Northern Atlantic, the Pacific Ocean and the Baltic Sea, inhibited the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme as well as HIV-induced syncytium formation. Beress et al [61] reported a new procedure for the isolation of the anti-HIV PS from this marine alga.",

More alarmingly, over the past decade, the incidence and severity of infections caused by HSV have increased due to the growth in number of immunocompromised patients produced by aggressive chemotherapy regimens, expanded organ transplantation and a greater occurrence of HIV infections. Unfortunately, prolonged therapies with acyclovir, the most successful antiherpetic drug, have resulted in some undesirable complications and also induced the emergence of drug-resistant viruses.

For example, carrageenans are sulphated galactans that can be extracted from certain red seaweeds.

Mode of action studies are consistent with the carrageenans having a major effect on the attachment of virus to the cells. Adsorption of HSV-1 is primarily mediated by the envelope glycoprotein gC, which binds to heparan sulphate residues present on the proteoglycans on the surface of target cells.

[106] reviewed information on Spiridina platensis, a blue-green alga with diverse biological activity. Preparations obtained from this alga have been found to be active against several enveloped viruses, including CMV. It was revealed that calcium spirulan, a sulphated PS isolated from Spirulina platensis, selectively inhibited the penetration of the virus into host cells [62] . Retention of molecular conformation by chelation of calcium ion with sulphate groups may be indispensable to its antiviral effect. The antiviral activity of a polysaccharidic fraction obtained from another red seaweed, Nothogenia fastigiata, was also reported [107] .

Since the advent of mass immunization campaigns, the incidence of measles has decreased dramatically in many developed countries. This is not the case elsewhere, however, where the virus still takes its toll in large numbers, especially in malnourished or immunocompromised individuals. Secondary bacterial infections are prevalent in these populations. Although most infections are relatively short-lived and innocuous in healthy individuals, encephalitis can develop in approximately 0.1% of cases; hence vaccination is desirable. Following respiratory infection, the virus readily invades local lymphoid tissues and gains access to the blood, from where it disseminates widely in the body. There has not been much demand for chemotherapy; vaccination seems to be the choice. No really effective antiviral has been evaluated, although some plant compounds have been shown to inhibit MV replication effectively, such as PS from the blue-green alga Spirulina platensis [62] .",

Initially the virus gains access to muscle, sensory organs or skin, and there replicates in local unmyelinated (sensory) nerve fibers. Many layers of epithelial cells are susceptible to the virus but the principal target is the unprotected neuron. The brain is where most damage is done, resulting in the familiar psychomotor disturbances. In addition, the virus spreads into salivary glands (by axoplasmic flow again), from where it is secreted from the asinar mucous cells and transmitted to the victim. The objective of much research on the rabies virus has been the development of better vaccines and therapeutic measures, some of them from natural sources. For example, different natural polymeric carbohydrates inhibited rabies virus infection in chicken-embryo-related cells by interfering with the virus adsorption process [126] . The charge density and the polymeric backbone of the molecules seem to play a role in influencing the antiviral properties, whereas other features such as the sugar moieties do not appear to be relevant.",

The infection may be more severe in pregnant women. Vaccination programmes are in place in many countries, and the belief is that the virus will eventually be brought under control. Although there seems to be no apparent role or need for specific antiviral therapy, reports on the antirubella activity of natural products and extracts have been reported [57] . For example, the natural carbohydrate scleroglucan, three sulphate derivatives and dextran sulphate were investigated for their inhibitory effect on rubella virus infection on Vero cells [127] . The results indicated that PS blocked a step in virus replication subsequent to virus attachment, such as internalisation and/or uncoating.

Since 1957, epidemics have been recorded intermittently in several European countries bordering the Mediterranean, in the Caribbean, and in Brazil, and more recently in other European countries and parts of Africa. Although pigs appear to be the only species infected naturally, the virus can be adapted to grow in a variety of other cell types and experimentally infects goats and rabbits. In view of this, it seems worthwhile to consider the possibility of its natural persistence in animals other than swine and man. Transmission of ASFV usually occurs through the respiratory route. Following inhalation, the virus invades and attacks local lymph nodes and the endothelium of blood vessels, with the resuh that high titers of virus circulate in the blood and lymph, and eventually in various secretory fluids. Attempts have been made to produce vaccines, but without much success. In any case, the virus mutates frequently in the wild and crossprotection of animals is not complete. Since the virion contains several enzyme activities, and the DNA can probably code for more in the infected cell, the possibility of specific chemotherapy, along the lines of antiherpes chemicals, should be profitable.",
