The main structural protein is the spike (S) glycoprotein, which comprises a divergent S1 subunit and conserved S2 subunit (de Groot et al., 1987; Shil et al., 2011). The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011), and it carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific determinants. The S1 domain exhibits high sequence diversity, where 20%\u201325% (even up to 50%) of the amino acids differ within the S1 subunit among IBV serotypes. After comparing the S1 subunit from a number of distinct IBV isolates, a previous study defined particularly variable segments at the amino terminus of the S1 subunit as hypervariable regions (HVRs) (Kusters et al., 1989).",

In addition, the HVRs are possibly associated with receptor binding. It has been reported that the critical amino acids for attachment of the M41 spike overlap with a HVR in the S1 subunit (Promkuntod et al., 2014).

Thus, in this study, we manipulated the IBV Beaudette genome by reverse genetics to exchange the HVRs in the Beaudette strain with those in ck/CH/LDL/091022 in order to precisely determine their biological functions. We also explored the possibility of developing a reverse genetic vaccine candidate cultured in Vero cells to provide protection from the prevalent field strains.

The three HVRs in the isolate ck/CH/LDL/091022 were identified based on alignments of the amino acid sequences, as described previously (Zhang et al., 2015). The sequences of the IBV cDNA covering the three HVRs in the S gene were replaced separately or simultaneously with those from ck/CH/LDL/091022, and subsequently ligated into the full-length IBV cDNA (Fig. 1\na and Table 1\n). Full-length transcripts generated in vitro were introduced into Vero cells by electroporation. IBV N gene transcripts were also generated to enhance the efficiency of viral recovery. Total RNA was prepared from the electroporated Vero cells or infected allantoic liquid. Viral RNA replication was investigated based on RT-PCR of negative-strand genomic RNA (Tan et al., 2006). The S gene in the recovered IBV clones (third passage in Vero cells and embryonated eggs) was amplified by RT-PCR and subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. The gene was characterized during the third passage of viruses in specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated eggs or Vero cells. The seven rescued recombinant IBVs were designated as rHVR I, rHVR II, rHVR III, rHVR I/II, rHVR I/III, rHVR II/III, and rHVR I/II/III.",

Vero cells were cultured overnight in 96-well microplates (Corning, USA) (105 cells/well). For the adsorption assay, each strain was incubated in cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C with three replicates (Fang et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2017). After two washes with PBS, the microplates were fixed with methanol and 1% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Next, the microplates were washed three times and blocked with 8% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times, the microplates were incubated with the primary mouse monoclonal antibody 6D10 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. A similar procedure was then performed where the plates were incubated for 40 min with the peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Peroxidase substrate solution (TMB; Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the plates were developed in darkness. The color reaction was stopped with stop solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and the absorbance was read at 630 nm. For the internalization assay, cells were seeded into 96-well microplates and inoculated with each strain for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS, before treating the infected cells with citrate buffer for 1 min to inactivate the adsorbed but not internalized virus. The cells were washed with PBS to remove the citrate buffer. The cELISA process was performed as described above. The cELISA results were expressed as the relative viral load adsorbed or internalized into cells relative to the Beaudette control.",

The autopsy results showed that ck/CH/ LDL/091022 caused obvious swollen pale kidneys, where the tubules and ureters were distended with urates, thereby indicating the nephropathogenic potential of the virus. However, the autopsies detected almost no changes in the groups treated with the recombinant IBVs and Beaudette.

The scores were lowest in the Beaudette group and highest in the ck/CH/ LDL/091022 group, and there were no differences in the scores between the groups treated with the recombinant IBVs and Beaudette. However, the scores in the groups treated with the recombinant IBVs and Beaudette differed significantly from those with ck/CH/ LDL/091022. Finally, no IBV RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal swabs from chickens inoculated with the recombinant IBVs and Beaudette after 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 days by real-time RT-PCR, where the results were considered positive when the Ct value was less than 32 (Li et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017). The results confirmed that the recombinant IBVs were avirulent according to the histomorphometry and histopathology findings.",

These previous studies employed forward genetics methods to determine the effects of the HVRs on serotypes by characterizing phylogenetically closely related isolates. However, these strains inevitably had mutations in other parts of the IBV genome, thereby making it difficult to establish a precise model for further studies based on these previous findings. In the present study, we manipulated the IBV RNA genomes by reverse genetics to produce site-directed mutations in order to elucidate the specific biological functions of the HVRs.",

All of the recombinant IBVs proliferated in Vero cells (Figs. 1b and Figure 2), and had the similar growth kinetics as Beaudette in Vero cells (Fig. 2) and embryonated eggs (Fig. 3b). The accumulation of heterogenous HVRs weakened the capacity for adsorption during infection by the recombinant viruses in vitro (Fig. 4a and b). The HVRs may be associated with the receptor-binding domain, so the heterogenous HVRs weakened the interaction between the viruses and their receptors on the host cells. With the same sequences of fusion subunit S2, the recombinant IBVs and Beaudette did not differ significantly in the internalization assay. It is unclear whether the recombinant viruses have more efficient internalization than Beaudette and the S proteins assemble correctly in the recombinant viruses, and whether there is a comparable amount of S on the virus particle. These problems require for further investigation.",

Thus, the replication capacity was similar for the recombinant IBVs and the Beaudette strain in SPF chickens. It appears that only swapping the HVRs did not greatly affect the cell and tissue tropisms, although replacing the ectodomain of the S glycoprotein in the Beaudette strain can alter the growth characteristics (Casais et al., 2003). Virus binding to host cells is the first step in tropism determination and HVRs within the S1 subunit may affect IBV binding (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011), but S2 is responsible for membrane fusion (Sun et al., 2017), and thus exchanging the HVRs did not change their tropism.",

In the present study, the recombinant IBVs remained avirulent with the HVRs from pathogenic ck/CH/LDL/091022, thereby indicating that only exchanging the HVR sequences did not have major impacts on pathogenicity (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Sup. Fig. 2). According to Hodgson et al., the apathogenic nature of the recombinant IBV BeauR-M41(S) indicates that the S protein ectodomain from a virulent strain is not necessarily sufficient to overcome the attenuating mutations in other genes in the apathogenic Beaudette strain (Hodgson et al., 2004). It is possible that the replicase gene also contributes to the pathogenicity of IBV (Armesto et al., 2009; Hodgson et al., 2004). The functions of non-structural proteins (Nsp) in the context of pathogenesis are still not well understood, but some of the Nsps in other coronaviruses have been linked to loss of pathogenicity (Eriksson et al., 2008; Sperry et al., 2005).",

However, in our study, the introduction of heterogenous HVRs did not develop an independent serotype, although the antigenic relatedness values for the recombinant IBVs and Beaudette generally decreased as the number of heterogenous HVR exchanges increased (Table 2). This result is consistent with the conclusion of Santos Fernando et al. who found that three IBV isolates mainly exhibited mutations in the HVRs but they belonged to the same serotype (Santos Fernando et al., 2017). The repertoire of neutralizing polyclonal antibodies may react with the many epitopes of an antigen. Exchanging the HVRs could change several antigen determinants but it is not necessarily sufficient to change the serotype because other neutralizing epitopes have been identified in other parts of the S1 subunit and S2 subunit (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2005; Kusters et al., 1989; Lenstra et al., 1989). In particular cases, a very low number of critical amino acid changes is sufficient to greatly alter the antigenicity (Cavanagh et al., 1992), although this view does not apply in all cases (Chen et al., 2015). In conclusion, the recombinant IBVs exhibited differences in antigenicity, but exchanging only the three HVRs between the two parental strains did not change the serotype.",

However, current commercial vaccines have been challenged by the emergence of new IBV serotypes. Recently, reverse genetic techniques have been employed to modify IBV vaccine candidates. QX-like strains (LX4-type) emerged in China and spread to Asia (Mahmood et al., 2011), Russia (Bochkov et al., 2006), and Europe (Beato et al., 2005; Worthington et al., 2008). In this study, using ck/CH/LDL/091022 as a representative of epidemic QX-like strains, we modified the genome of the Beaudette strain to construct seven recombinant IBVs. We determined the effects of the HVRs and explored the possibility of developing a vaccine candidate that could proliferate in cells and provide protection against the prevalent field strains. The introduction of a few heterogenous peptides rather than the whole S protein may facilitate the development of multiepitope peptide vaccines to protect against a wide range of IBV serotypes (Yang et al., 2009). In the present study, the virus cross-neutralization and vaccination challenge tests indicated that only swapping the HVRs did not provide sufficient cross-protection, but further exploration of the recombinant IBVs may provide insights into novel vaccine candidates.",
