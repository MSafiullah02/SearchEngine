Although several clinical trials are in progress to test possible therapies, the treatment is focused on the alleviation of symptoms which may include dry cough, fever and pneumonia [2]. Following the SARS outbreak, existing antivirals, including nine protease inhibitors [3], nelfinavir blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication at lowest concentration (EC50 = 1.13 \u03bcM, CC50 = 24.32 \u03bcM, SI = 21.52). Following this, antiviral efficiency of several FDA-approved drugs have been reported, including remdesivir (GS-5734, Gilead) (EC50 = 0.77 \u03bcM) and chloroquine (EC50 = 1.13 \u03bcM) against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro showed potential inhibition at low-micromolar concentration [4]. The efficacy of remdesivir is evident from a recent recovery of US patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 after intravenous treatment [5], while chloroquine is being evaluated in an open-label trial (ChiCTR2000029609). Moreover, Ivermectin, a broad spectrum anti-parasitic agent reported in vitro activity (\u223c5000-fold reduction) in a model of Vero/hSLAM cells infected with a SARS-CoV-2 isolate (Australia/VIC01/2020) [6]. Others include Nafamostat (EC50 = 22.50 \u03bcM), Nitazoxanide (EC50 = 2.12 \u03bcM) and Favipiravir (EC50 = 61.88 \u03bcM) [4]. Recently, hydroxychloroquine has shown to be effective in COVID-19 patients [7] and its efficiency has been reportedly reinforced by azithromycin for virus elimination [8], despite there is no well-controlled, randomized clinical evidence support azithromycin therapy in COVID-19 [9].",

The first ORF (ORF1a/b) is about two-thirds of the whole genome length and encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16). ORFs near 3\u2032-end of the genome encodes four main structural proteins including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Among non-structural proteins, most are known to play a vital role in CoV replication. Structural proteins, however, are important for virion assembly as well as for causing CoV infection.

However, this approach requires the identification of a conserved target region within entire Coronavirus genus [12,13]. On the contrary, all structural proteins including S, E, M, HE, and N proteins among different CoVs have considerable variations as reported [[14], [15], [16]] therefore, adding more complexity towards identification of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Subsequently, the Nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Nsp13 helicase, and main protease (Mpro) or chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) [17] constitute highly conserved regions in non-structural proteins among coronaviruses which can be targeted.",

The identified potential hits against each target were subjected to in silico ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, toxicity) predictions, which includes drug-likeness and toxicity potential. This filtering removed substantial hits that exhibited poor ADMET due to inhibitory effects on the renal organic cation transporter and CYP450 isozymes. While a large subset of hits was found to contain high-risk chemical groups like epoxides and quinones, the potential hits against each target with the lowest docking energy were analysed for their binding pose inside the binding site. After careful inspection, best hits based on AD Vina predicted binding energies were re-docked with Glide and best docked complexes were further processed through 20ns MD simulations. MMGBSA method was employed to analyse electrostatic and vdW energy contribution towards total free energy of binding. The MD-simulated complexes indicating protein backbone stability (during the last 5ns in a 20 ns production run) were considered for further molecular interaction analysis. Based on molecular interactions and binding free energy calculations, the subsequent screening resulted in 5, 4 and 3 hits for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, Nsp12 and Nsp13, respectively (Detailed ADMET profile of these compounds is tabulated in Table S1, estimated from Swiss-ADME server [36]). The top hits with AD Vina, Glide XP-score together with contribution of electrostatic (\u0394Eele), van der Waals (\u0394Evdw), and solute-solvent energies (\u0394Gnp and \u0394Gp) towards total binding free energy (\u0394Gtol) were estimated through Amber-MMGBSA module as tabulated in Table 1\n.

The generated redocked pose was quite similar with the co-crystalized conformation (\nFig. S4\n). Top-ranked SARS-CoV-2 Mpro hits were filtered based on the interaction with the catalytic dyad (at least one H-bond with either His41 or Cys145 or strong vdW interactions). A total of 13 compounds were analysed after 20 ns MD simulation based on the stability for at least last 5 ns? MMGBSA calculations were performed for the most stable complexes. Among top hits, total binding free energies (\u0394Gtol) were very promising for cmp12, cmp14, cmp17 and cmp18 which exhibited \u0394Gtol = -45.22, -44.91, -41.72, and -44.55 kcal/mol. In all complexes, ligand stayed inside the binding pocket and backbone RMSD of Mpro remained stable throughout simulation period (\nFig. S5\n). All these compounds contributed well through H-bonds and exhibited favourable electrostatic energy for cmp3 (\u0394Gele = -21.38 kcal/mol), cmp12 (\u0394Gele = -26.16 kcal/mol), cmp14 (\u0394Gele = -33.56 kcal/mol) and cmp18 (\u0394Gele = -36.65 kcal/mol) except cmp17, which displayed weak electrostatic energy (\u0394Gele = -5.39 kcal/mol) due to unstable H-bonds over a simulation period (\nTable 1\n). Further in-depth molecular interaction analysis after 20ns MD simulations unveiled significant findings with respect to Mpro-subsites (\nFig. 2\nA) and per-residue decomposition is displayed in Fig. 2B. Among all compounds, cmp12 and 14 showed some consensus features, where pentacyclic moiety of cmp12 anchored right inside the subsites and formed H-bonds with Ser144 of S1, Cys145 of catalytic dyad, Met165 of S4, and terminal 4-methylaniline established two H-bonds with two neighbouring glutamine residues (Gln189 and Gln192) of S4. Similarly, biphenyl interacted hydrophobically with S2, triazole moiety established one H-bond with Cys145 of catalytic dyad, and pyrazole-pyrimidine moiety formed three H-bonds with Gln189, Thr190, and Gln192 located at S4. The remaining compounds (cmp3, cmp17 and cmp18) demonstrated distinct H-bond patterns, even though the central moieties superimposed well near the catalytic dyad. For instance, the terminal oxadiazol-2-amine moiety of cmp3 mainly interacted through H-bonds with Cys145 of catalytic dyad, Asn142, Ser144, Glu166 and His172 of S1, and central carbaldehyde also formed H-bond with Glu166 of S1, Whereas, cmp17 only formed H-bonds with residues of S4 through terminal carbazole-1-carboxamide moiety and cmp18 established H-bonds with residues of S2 and S4 through urea and terminal imidazole moieties. Although the compounds mainly interacted electrostatically, however nonpolar solvation energies also slightly contributed towards ligand binding. The residual decomposition analysis revealed the favourable contribution of catalytic dyad towards total binding free energy, where Cys145 exhibited -1.058, -1.19, -2.12, -1.015, -0.892 kcal/mol and His41 exhibited -0.423, -1.528, -0.656, -1.032, -0.532 kcal/mol with cmp3, 12, 14, 17 and 18 respectively. Other residues located in close vicinity to catalytic dyad also contributed significantly which included, Glu189 (ranging from -3.505 to -1.219 kcal/mol), Glu166 (-2.711 to -0.845 kcal/mol), and Met165 (-3.859 to -0.988 kcal/mol) (\nFig. 2B). Such favourable residual energy contribution was evident from the H-bonds formed by Glu166, Glu189 and Met165. The 2D chemical structure representation of each compound is displayed in connection with interactions of structural moieties with binding pocket subsites (\nFig. 2C and D).",

These include the residues: (i) Arg553 and Arg555 of motif F which exhibited most favourable \u0394Gtol with cmp2 (-2.05 and -2.14 kcal/mol), 17a (-1.84 and -2.57 kcal/mol) and 21 (-2.4 and -1.04 kcal/mol), (ii) conserved Aspartate residues of motif A (Asp618 and Asp623) and C (Asp760), and (iii) conserved Serine residues of motif B (Ser682) and motif C (Ser759) and, d) Lys798 of motif D. Among these, Ser759 and Asp760 of motif C exhibited significant binding free energy with all compounds (ranging from -0.988 to -1.76 kcal/mol and -1.03 to -1.47 kcal/mol), while most of the residues interacted electrostatically. By the end of long run simulation process, an x-ray resolved SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 polymerase structure was deposited (6M71) [40]. We compared crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 and found only 0.41\u00c5 deviation (\nFig. S7\n). In further support, MD simulations of homology model and 6M71 also showed consensus RMSD over a period of 50 ns? Moreover, the conformations of cmp2, 17a and 21 showed identical binding modes when docked inside the polymerase active site of crystal structure. Additionally, the binding mode and molecular interaction profile of cmp2, 17a and 21 agreed with the reported comparative binding model of remdesivir and sofosbuvir diphosphate (HCV-RdRp, 4WTG) [41] with polymerase (\nFig. S7\n) [40].",

In the current study, a brief structural elucidation was performed together which revealed strikingly similar features in SARS-CoV-2, when compared with crystal structures of SARS-CoV-RdRp (6NUR) and helicase (6JYT). These viral proteins play a crucial role in the viral life cycle and considered among the most popular strategies for antiviral therapeutics [44,46]. Structural analyses has revealed that the substrate-binding pockets of SARS-CoV-Mpro, active site of RdRp and NTPase binding pocket of helicase are highly conserved [47], which can lead to the concept of \u201cwide-spectrum inhibitors\u201d for targeting CoVs. Furthermore, extensive SBVS procedure led to the identification of potential hits against each target, which were assessed through MD simulations.

In the substrate-binding pocket, catalytic dyad residues, highly conserved residues of S1, Gln189 and Met165 of S4, displayed relative importance in ligand binding, suggested a possibility for inhibitor design targeting this region in the Mpro. In case of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12, the in-depth interaction analysis inside the conserved motifs (\nFig. 3\n) revealed functionally important aspartate residues of motif A (Asp623) and motif C (Asp760), together with conserved Arginine residues of motif F (Arg553 and Arg555), and Ser759 (motif C) which were found highly interacted with the compounds. Among these, motif A and C are most strikingly conserved aspartate residues that bind divalent metal ions necessary for catalytic activity [30,31]. Moreover, the importance of aspartate residues in RdRps supported from various other mutational studies [[37], [38], [39]], suggested a conserved binding feature of cmp2, cmp17a and cmp21 along with side chains of Arg553, Arg555 and Ser759 which line deep in the binding pocket of nCoV-RdRp, thus enhancing it as an anchor for inhibitory molecules.",
