They feed on nectar, seeds, insects, fruits, fish, frogs, and small mammals [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Bats have a crucial role in nutrient cycling, and bat guano is rich in nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, and potassium, making it as an ideal biofertilizer that is marketed in many countries. Bats mostly dwell in caves and are present on every continent in the world except Antarctica [5]. They are highly diverse in their anatomy and lifestyle and probably play a key role in the ecosystem by serving as a natural pest-controlling agent [4,6].",

As bats harbor a diverse community of bacterial species, understanding what constitutes a normal bacterial community and the factors that can influence them could have a profound effect on hosts and ecosystems. Most studies use culture-based approaches to analyze bacterial communities associated with the bat intestinal tract because the bat intestinal environment is nutritionally rich and favors the growth of various microbes [12]. This method has successfully identified bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella [13], Shigella, Enterobacter [14], Yersinia [15], and many other intestinal pathogens [16] from bat guts [17]. However, there are limitations in culture-based methods to discover novel and potentially pathogenic bacteria and their interactions with the environment, so the use of culture-independent methods is essential to study the polutation structure, genetic diversity, as well as ecological roles of most microorganisms [18]. Metagenomic studies have used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize gut microbiomes and microbes in the guano of several bat species [19,20] and the feces of other animals to determine their diet and the diversity of metabolic functional genes and enzymes [21,22].",

Briefly, 1 gm of the sample from each bat was finely ground in a sterile mortar and pestle followed by suspending the aliquot in 1 ml of sterile distilled water. The sample suspension was then mixed thoroughly, and serial dilution was done upto 109 and plated onto different bacteriological media like Nutrient Agar, Trypticase Soy Agar, Brain Heart Infusion Agar and Luria Bertani Agar (Himedia). After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 24\u201348 h the plates were observed and total colony forming units (CFUs) were calculated by plate count technique [33]. Colonies with different morphologies were sub-cultured into pure culture by inoculating in freshly prepared nutrient agar plates [34]. Biochemical tests of the pure cultures were carried out according to Bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology. The bacterial isolates were identified up to genus level according to identification keys available [[35], [36], [37], [38]]. The isolates were tested for Gram staining; motility test [36] followed by catalase and oxidase tests [36]. IMVIC Indole, Methyl red, Voges Praskauer, Citrate utilization and Triple sugar iron tests were performed to identify for genus level identification [39]. Hemolytic activity of the isolates was carried out in triplicates as per [40]. Primary screening of protease enzyme activity was carried out in skim milk agar for testing the ability of the isolates to produce zones of clearance around the colonies which will indicate the production of protease enzyme. The tests were performed in triplicates. All the plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24\u201348 h and the zones were measured.",

The results confirm that Proteobacteria is the most dominant bacterial phylum in both bat species. Bacterial phyla such as Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and AD3 were abundant in the guano samples but were not found and or had very low numbers in the gut samples. The bacterial abundance in the gut microbiome depends on the niches of the bat.

Corynebacterium diphtheria can cause diphtheria, skin infections, and septicemia, while Corynebacterium ulcerans is recognized as a causative agent in the re-emergence of diphtheria. They are mainly transmitted through droplets, secretions, or direct contact [71]. The genus Mycobacterium is a causative agent for tuberculosis. A few reports also describe a potential etiological relationship between M. avium paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease in humans, but the issue is still under debate [72]. Similar findings were also observed by Banskar et al. [19]. Two bacterial genera, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, may cause pneumonia, meningitis, bacteremia, infectious lesions, neonatal infections, and septicemia [73,74]. We observed that the R. monceros gut microbiome also harbors known pathogenic microbes, but their pathogenicity has not been determined.",

Hence, using both culture-dependent and metagenomic approaches, abundant bacterial species were isolated. However, when using the culture-dependent approach, the identified bacterial species were limited in comparison to the metagenomic approach. This could be due to the inability to cultivate some of the bacterial species, which could only be extracted by the metagenomic approach, where the total DNA is extracted from the bat gut.",

The metagenomic analysis of the OTUs from the gut revealed diverse bacterial communities as well as zoonotic and human pathogens. There were differences between the two methods used, which could be related to host specificity, diet, and habitat. This first report on the bat gut microbiome collected from Arwah Cave could stir scientific interest in the possibilities of isolating and characterizing novel bacteria with both beneficial and harmful effects. These bacteria could contribute to gut metabolism and the development of anti-infectives and probiotics. Some may also act as plant growth-promoting bacteria and degrade enzymes like cellulase and chitinase. Human pathogenic bacteria were also identified, but their virulence traits in humans have yet to be determined.",
