This has taken form in rescheduling nonacute appointments and utilizing telehealth programs. 6 Otolaryngologists may be particularly at risk due to a high viral load in the upper aerodigestive tract and the risk of aerosolization inherent to common otolaryngologic procedures. In light of this, there has been a widespread shift among otolaryngologists toward minimizing direct patient interaction in nonacute settings. 7, 8 Several otolaryngology divisions and departments have documented their subjective response to this changing landscape, but little objective measurement on COVID-19's impact has been reported. 9, 10 Herein, we discuss the affect that COVID-19 has had on our institution. The primary objectives were to examine the quantitative change in patient visits, as well as the modality in which they were completed, over the first month of the virus's impact within the United States, in comparison with the prior year. Secondarily, we analyzed trends in weekly visitations, differences among otolaryngology subspecialties, and disparities among patients of varying ages.",

[14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Particularly pertinent to otolaryngology is a heightened concern regarding the increased risk of COVID-19 transmission owing to the nature of the head and neck examination and common otolaryngologic procedures. 7, 8 Furthermore, telehealth and distance care can be especially difficult among subsets of otolaryngology diseases, including head and neck cancers and airway disorders. 19 As the scope of otolaryngology practice is wide, ranging from benign pathologies (including hearing loss and sinusitis) to head and neck cancer, a shift in the quantity and modality of clinical visits is expected and encouraged. Many institutions have fashioned and employed guidelines regarding triaging patient care conditioned on the acuity of the otolaryngologic condition. 7, 8, 10 Nevertheless, with a lack of complete understanding of COVID-19 and its impact, there is expected variability within these recommendations.",

This has allowed for fewer direct interactions in the setting of a global pandemic while still providing necessary acute care. In assessing this transition, we analyzed administrative records of our otolaryngology division's outpatient practice patterns during the first 4 weeks following hospital-wide aggressive COVID-19 policy changes-March 16 to April 10, 2020-and compared them with the corresponding period from 1 year prior.

Of the 2020 completed visits, 55.8% were via telehealth. In the corresponding 2019 period, no telehealth visits were completed ( Figure  1A ). Few comparable objective data have quantified the changes in outpatient practice to date. One health care technology company, Phreesia, collected and analyzed data from .50,000 physician clients from February 1 through April 16, 2020, utilizing practice management/scheduling software, check-in information provided by patients, and electronic medical records. 20 Consistent with our findings, the COVID-19-affected period saw a significant decline in outpatient visits from baseline. Interestingly, relative to other ambulatory practices, otolaryngology had the second-greatest decline of in-person visitations-approximately 75%-second only to ophthalmology (79%). As mentioned, concern for increased risk of transmission with close examination of the head and neck may contribute to this and would also apply to ophthalmology. In addition, a relatively large volume of elective, semielective, and nonurgent evaluations likely factors in, especially for the surgical subspecialties.",

While the precise reasoning for higher pediatric and head and neck oncology telehealth utilization rates is unclear, it should be noted that the Yale School of Medicine oversees outpatient visits for general and specialty otolaryngology, while Yale New Haven Hospital, a separate organization, manages the head and neck oncology and pediatric otolaryngology clinics. Another explanation may again include the acuity of care necessitating increased efforts to coordinate visits. Within pediatrics, preexisting comfort level with technology and telehealth among younger parents and teenagers may be a contributing factor. Not surprising, the total number of SLP and audiology visits dropped precipitously in 2020 as compared with 2019, and the majority of 2020 visits occurred in person.

Additionally, only a 4-week time frame was utilized, limiting the number of scheduled visits and the analysis included. It is likely that these trends continue to evolve. Last, this was a single institution's experience, which can limit the globalization of its findings. Nonetheless, quantitative data can allow other institutions to glean useful information on possible transitioning methods and expected practice alterations. Continuing to monitor trends within health care systems during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial. Consistent findings of increased in-person interaction among at-risk populations, for example, may promote innovative and useful action in the application of safe care. Furthermore, with a broader call for health care reform and universal access to affordable care, efficient use of resources, via patient triaging and telehealth, can have a profound impact beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. 23 Conclusion COVID-19 has had a rapid and global impact on the triaging and administration of health care. The majority of outpatient visits in our otolaryngology division were rescheduled or cancelled in response to this pandemic. We identified a sharp rise in the number of telehealth visits, which became more efficient in their completion rates over time. Importantly, older adults were more likely to be seen in person and less likely to have telehealth visits as compared with younger adults. Further identification of health care trends is vital to promoting safe and efficient care.",
