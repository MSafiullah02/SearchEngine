Any such \u2018ramping up\u2019 of disease emergence offers a range of possible outcomes, from little overall impact to the occurrence of potentially catastrophic, collective disease events (del Rio Vilas et al., 2013).",

Equally, any factor that lengthens \u2018stochastic chains of disease transmission\u2019 allows pathogens time to adapt to their hosts, and thereby enhances disease emergence (Antia et al., 2013).

Under conditions of climate change, such system \u2018features and forcings\u2019 are unlikely to act on a single disease. However, not all diseases will reach the threshold required for global spread. We know that climate change will decrease the threat of some diseases, while having little impact on others. It is possible that conditions, on balance, will support, rather than inhibit, collective disease events. As such, we are working from the hypothesis that climate change will nudge synergies and interactions between drivers, and between diseases themselves, forging a \u2018cascade effect\u2019 that may ultimately result in MEIDs. While a cascade builds energy and momentum over time, similarly climate change may forge conditions for MEIDs. If so, this raises a variety of questions. Firstly, can we identify, a priori, the cascade of factors that might alter the composition and/or frequency of occurrence of such collective disease events? Secondly, can we calculate the related risk? Finally, on a broader level, will such cascades provide warning signs of wider systems change?",

An R0 > 1 supports an epidemic, while R0 < 1 predicts that a disease will die out. In this manner, R0 is a threshold, as opposed to a scale or strength, value. For vectors and some parasites, R0 refers to \u2018the average number of female offspring produced throughout the lifetime of a mature female \u2026 which themselves achieve reproductive maturity, in the absence of density-dependent constraints\u2019 (Gumel and Lenhart, 2010). Calculations of R0 are then linked to general habitat conditions such as the normalised difference vegetative index (NDVI), surface hydrology and temperature data, the latter via remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS) (Mas-Coma et al., 2008). The parameters are applied to simulation models to create predictions/scenarios of a vector population and, hence, dynamics of a particular vector-borne disease under conditions of climate change. Such work has been vital to understanding the role of different drivers, particularly climate change, in disease outcomes.",
