Bangladesh is a \u2018hotspot\u2019 for emerging zoonotic diseases [9], with a relatively high diversity of wildlife that likely harbors new zoonotic pathogens, one of the densest human populations on the planet, and a high level of connectivity between people, domestic animals and wildlife. In Bangladesh and India, frugivorous Pteropus giganteus bats have been identified as a reservoir for NiV [10], [11], which has been recognized as the cause of several outbreaks of encephalitis [12]\u2013[14]. Pteropus giganteus bats are common throughout the Indian subcontinent, living in close association with humans and feeding on cultivated fruit [14]. NiV transmission from bats to humans has been linked with the harvest and consumption of raw date palm sap, which becomes contaminated with bat feces, urine or saliva overnight when bats such as P. giganteus come to feed from the collecting pots [14], [15]. Date palm sap or other foods eaten by both bats and people, may also serve as a vehicle for transmission of other bat-borne agents.",

Each bat was anesthetized using isoflurane gas; morphometric measurements (weight, forearm length, head length, and body condition) were taken and bats were aged [10]. Each bat was marked for future identification using an RFID microchip (AVID corp, www.avidid.com) implanted subcutaneously between the scapulae. Three mL of blood were collected and placed into serum separator tubes (vacutainer; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Serum was allowed to separate overnight at 4\u00b0C then drawn off without centrifugation and immediately frozen using a liquid nitrogen dry shipper. To inactivate potentially infectious agents, serum samples were heat-treated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and then stored at \u221270\u00b0C. For RNA extraction, 250 \u00b5L of serum was added to 750 \u00b5L Tri-Reagent LS (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA). Saliva was collected from the bat's throat using a sterile cotton swab. Urine was collected either by catching urine in a 1.0 mL sterile cryovial while the bat was urinating, or by urethral swab. Urine and saliva swabs were immediately placed into 1 mL Tri-Reagent LS and frozen in liquid nitrogen.",

Each pool yielded between 1,400 and 2,000 assembled contigs or singlton reads (representing 50,000\u201375,000 reads ranging in size from 31\u2013328 nt).

No viral sequences were detected in other pools at the nt or aa levels. Screening of the individual RNA preparations from the pregnant bat pool using primers derived from the UHTS reads confirmed the presence of the GBV-like sequence in the serum of bat 93. A quantitative real time PCR assay indicated a load of approximately 30 000 RNA copies in bat-93 serum extract, and identified an additional 4 positive bat sera from the original 98 samples (5/98; 5%), indicating serum loads ranging from 350 to 70,000 RNA copies per assay. These positive samples came from male bats that were not included in the initial UHTS pools.

In GBV-D the first potential signal sequence cleavage site is present after a stretch of 57, largely basic aa (6 kDa, pI = 12), followed by sequence homologous to E1 (pfam 01539, http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) (\nFigure 3\n). The single glycosylation site N177IT present in that sequence is located in a position comparable to GBV-C, -A, -B and HCV glycosylation sites. Identification of the downstream E2 termini is less apparent as the next 580 aa contain multiple potential signal sequences and 10 potential glycosylation sites that indicate no homology to hepaciviral E2/NS1 (pfam 01560), until the sequence aligns with N-terminal NS2 motifs (pfam 01538) (\nFigure 2\n\n,\n\nFigure 3\n). However, despite similarity to pfam 01538 no signal sequence compatible with cleavage at A759/A was found; cleavage may occur at G826/R, which combined with potential signalase cleavage at A584/F may indicate the existence of a heavily glycosylated potential 26 kDa product instead of the p7 trans-membrane protein identified in HCV [37]\u2013[39] or the 13 kDa variant described in GBV-B [40], [41]. Conserved C-terminal motifs of the autocatalytic NS2/NS3 endoprotease domain are compatible with NS2/NS3 cleavage at S1067/A and comparable to other GBV and HCV [42]. \nFigure 3\n indicates potential cleavage sites for NS3 (peptidase S29, pfam 02907; DEAD box helicase, pfam 07652; helicase C, pfam 00271), NS4A (pfam 01006), NS4B (pfam 01001), NS5A (domain-1a zinc finger, pfam 08300; domain-1b, pfam 08301), and NS5B (pfam 00998).",

Whereas previous studies of bats have employed assays that test for known pathogens, ours is the first report of an unbiased molecular approach to pathogen discovery in this important reservoir of emerging infectious diseases. The modest yield of novel microbial sequences may reflect the choice of sample (e.g., serum vs feces, tissue or another specimen), competition between host and microbial template during unbiased amplification, or both. Efforts to address template competition are under way that include subtraction of host nucleic acids or the use of semi-random primers that do not amplify host sequences. Such efforts will likely enhance the sensitivity and throughput of unbiased sequencing technologies for pathogen discovery.",

Three types of GB viruses have been described: GBV-A, -B and -C [18], [19], [24], [25], [54], [57]. GBV-B, which has never been found in humans and was only reported in captive tamarins after serial passage of the original human GB serum [58], is most closely related to HCV and was recently classified together with HCV into a new genus, Hepacivirus, within the family Flaviviridae\n[16]. GBV-A and -C remain unclassified members of the family. GBV-A have been isolated from several New World monkeys. Different genotypes appear to be associated with specific monkey species of the genera Saguinus, Callithrix (Callitrichidae family) and Aotus (Aotidae family), without any clinical signs associated with infection [24], [54], [57]. GBV-C have been isolated from humans with non-A-E hepatitis; however, its pathogenicity is unknown and the virus is widespread in the human population [21], [59]\u2013[61]. Population studies showed that GB viruses are enzoonotic and species-specific within both Old and New World nonhuman primates as well as humans, and have likely co-evolved with their hosts over long periods of time [62]. Previously, the only GBV found in the Old world was GBV-C from chimpanzees (in Africa) and humans. Although GBV-C were found in humans, GB viruses have not been previously reported in primates or other animals on the Indian subcontinent.",

While the range of chimpanzees (Africa) and P. giganteus (the Indian subcontinent) do not overlap, it is possible that other primate species in Bangladesh or India, such as macaques, or other fruit bats in Africa such as Eidelon spp., whose range overlaps that of chimpanzees, may carry related viruses.

This is consistent with the behavior of GBV-A in its natural primate hosts [54]. In contrast, elevated alanine transferase levels and mild hepatitis are observed in experimental infections of macaques with GBV-C isolates from humans [67]. Five percent of the bats we studied were infected with one of at least two different strains of GBV-D, which suggests widespread viral circulation within this species. The observation that bats are asymptomatically infected with diverse strains that constitute a distinct phylogenetic clade is compatible with a co-evolutionary relationship between GBV and their hosts [57], [62], and supports the hypothesis that P. giganteus bats may be a natural reservoir for GBV-D. In one case we were able to detect GBV-D nucleic acid in saliva. This suggests a potential route for viral transmission via fighting or grooming behavior, or via food shared by bats.",

This species lives in close association with humans in Bangladesh and bats have been observed drinking from (and urinating into) date palm sap collecting pots [14]. Human consumption of contaminated palm juice is proposed to be a major route of NiV transmission [68]. Although it is unclear whether infectious virus was present in bat saliva, the observation that saliva can contain GBV-D nucleic acids provides a biologically plausible mechanism for transmission from infected bats to other hosts. While it is currently unknown whether GBV-D virus occurs in humans, up to 20% of non-A-E hepatitis cases remain unexplained [19].",
