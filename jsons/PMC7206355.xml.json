In these difficult times, the priority of all health care professionals is to take care of the infected sick. The pediatric endocrinology (PedEndo) community is currently actively committed to the daily care of children suspected of having COVID-19 infection or being affected by it, in addition to those with endocrine diseases. In contrast to findings in the majority of adults, children with CO\u00adVID-19 have mild clinical manifestations, and are mostly asymptomatic [1, 2, 3]. Nevertheless, pediatric endocrinologists worldwide, especially the younger ones, have been forced by current events to divert the focus of their clinical practice as well as scientific interest and reading to general pediatrics and even to infectious diseases and epidemiology. This sudden and unexpected challenge has, ultimately, urged pediatric subspecialists to rediscover the original appeal and importance of general pediatrics. My mentor, Prof. Brunetto Boscherini, used to say that only a skilled pediatrician may become a skilled pediatric endocrinologist. Therefore, this awful epidemic may ultimately lead to a significant improvement in training and expertise as well as the global view of the sick child in the PedEndo community.",

ACE2 degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1\u20137) and participates in the hydrolysis of other peptides including angiotensin I. ACE2 is expressed in many human tissues, including the lungs, heart, and kidneys. It has been postulated that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, commonly used as antihypertensive drugs, may increase the expression of ACE2, ultimately facilitating the viral invasion. However, data in favor of this hypothesis are largely insufficient and experimental and clinical research is warranted [5].",

In fact, the spike (S) protein of the coronavirus surface plays a key role in viral entry into the target cells. S protein must first be cleaved by a specific protease to be able to attach to the cell surface. The main protease involved in S protein priming is transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which thus represents a critical host cell factor for the invasion and spread of the virus [6, 7]. It is noteworthy that TMPRSS2 expression is upregulated by androgens [8] and modulated by specific microRNAs [9]. These findings suggest that the endocrine system may play a role in viral entry into target cells.",
