Some of the viruses such as beta-CoVs also have hemagglutinin esterase (HE) glycoprotein.[3] The RNA genome of CoV has seven genes that are conserved in the order: ORF1a, ORF1b, S, OEF3, E, M, N in 5' to 3' direction. The two-third part of the RNA genome is covered by the ORF1a/b, which produces the two viral replicase proteins that are polyproteins (PP1a and PP1ab).[9] Sixteen mature nonstructural proteins (NSPs) arise from further processing of these two PPs. These NSPs take part in different viral functions including the formation of the replicase transcriptase complex. The remaining genome part of the virus encodes the mRNA which produces the structural proteins, i.e., spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid, and other accessory proteins.[9] Another important envelop-associated protein which is expressed by only some strains of CoV is the HE protein.[10] The RNA genome of CoV is packed in the nucleocapsid protein and further covered with envelope.[11]",

After the receptor recognition, the virus genome with its nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm of the host cells. The viral genome contains ORF1a and ORF1b genes, which produce two PPs that are pp1a and pp1b,[16] which help to take command over host ribosomes for their own translation process.[17] Both pp1a and pp1b take part in the formation of the replication transcription complex.[16] After processing of PP by protease, it produces 16 NSPs. All NSPs have their own specific functions such as suppression of host gene expression by NSP1 and NSP2, formation of a multidomain complex by NSP3, NSP5 which is a M protease which has role in replication,[17] NSP4 and NSP6 which are transmembrane (TM) proteins,[18] NSP7 and NSP8 which act as a primase,[16] NSP9 \u2013 a RNA-binding protein, the dimeric form of which is important for viral infection. Induction of disturbance to the dimerization of NSP9[19] can be a way to overcome CoV infection.[20] NSP10 acts as a cofactor for the activation of the replicative enzyme.[21] NSP12 shows RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity, NSP13 shows helicase activity, NSP14 shows exoribonuclease activity, NSP15 shows endoribonuclease activity, and NSP16 has methyltransferase activity.[18] All NSPs have an important role in replication and transcription.[18]",

The outer cover is formed by the M, E, and S proteins.[22] Finally, the virus particle comes out of the ERGIC by making a bud-like structure.[23] These mature virions form a vesicle, which fuses with the plasma membrane and releases the virus particles into the extracellular region.[2324] The detailed structure of CoV and its life cycle is depicted in Figures 1 and 2. On infection, the SARS-CoV and MERS-COV cause a surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which cause damage to lung tissue,[13] deterioration of lung function, and then finally lung failure in some cases.[25]",

Three-dimensional structure with all complex can see from PDB that is 4LMC, 4LM9, 4LM7, and 4LI4, respectively.[26] One such molecule which was designed with this strategy is N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridine-2-yl) (N, N dimethyl amino) (PJ34), which was designed using the HCoV-OC43 model.[26] Binding of PJ34 on NTD affects the genome binding and replication process of CoV.[26] The crystal structure of COV-OC43 N-NTD with inhibitor PJ34 complex is given in PDB ID: 4KXJ.[26] On the basis of interactions between PJ34 and NTD of nucleocapsid protein, another inhibitor was designed that is H3 (6-chloro-7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethylamino) quinoxaline-5,8-dione), which also inhibits RNA binding.[2669] This highlights the importance of NTD in RNA binding.
