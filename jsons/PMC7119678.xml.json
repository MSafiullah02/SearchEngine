            "text": "Since the discovery of viruses in the twentieth century, considerable efforts have been made to improve the technics to detect and identify them. Cell cultures were the first diagnostic tool to be used in the mid-1950s, and since then, new techniques have been developed to decrease the time to a result (immunofluorescence, lateral flow chromatography) or to boost the sensitivity (molecular techniques) (Levine, 1996; Ginocchio and Harris, 2011). Many improvements have been made, and techniques combining speed and sensitivity are currently available, such as fully automated \u2018sample-in, result-out\u2019 multiplexed syndromic molecular tools (Bluchan and Ledeboer, 2014). Aside from being effective in terms of sensitivity and specificity, these latter diagnostic tools are able to recover non-cultivable viruses. As a consequence, questions regarding the usefulness of \u2018older\u2019 diagnostic methods regularly arise (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007; Hodinka and Kaiser, 2013). Meanwhile, important questions concerning these \u2018new\u2019 expensive rapid molecular techniques remain unanswered, such as their cost-effectiveness in terms of patient\u2019s management, or the clinical significance of detecting nucleic acids of micro-organisms that could be non-infectious at the time the sample is collected.",

More than 90% of influenza A isolates collected in Belgium were A(H1N1)pdm2009. Regarding influenza B, circulating strains were almost exclusively from the Victoria lineage according to the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health (Belgian Public Health Institute, 2019). The enrolment period was chosen in order to be sure to gather positive samples for influenza as it is intended to evaluate, in another article, the impact of the results on antiviral prescription. This choice obviously affects the prevalence of other viruses. Adults and children attending the emergency room (ER) and presenting with upper or lower respiratory symptoms were prospectively included if either intended to be maintained in the hospital or had any of the following conditions known to expose to a higher rate of complications of viral respiratory infections: chronic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis or asthma, sickle-cell disease, asplenia, neuromuscular diseases, severe neurological affections, hereditary metabolic disorders including diabetes, congenital or acquired immunosuppression, heart defects, chronic nephropathies, chronic liver diseases and pregnancy. Children under 3 months of age with a fever without focus of infection were also included.",

Lateral flow chromatography (LFC) tests and the FilmArray Respiratory Panel were used to test samples 24/7, whereas direct fluorescent assays (DFA) and cell cultures were performed during working hours (8:00 am to 5:00 pm) from Monday to Saturday. The Clart Pneumovir test was performed once a week. Lab results as well as clinical data from patients\u2019 chart were recorded and analyzed.

There is an effect of cough duration for influenza A with the antigen detection test (p = 0.032) and cell cultures (p = 0.010), due to a decrease in diagnostic sensitivity with cough duration (p = 0.017 and p = 0.010, respectively). The decrease is observed as soon as the cough duration exceeds 5 days. An age effect was also observed for influenza A with the antigen detection test (p = 0.006) and cell cultures (p = 0.023), due to a decrease in sensitivity with age (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004, respectively). The decrease is observed from the first age category with the antigen detection and from 15 years for the cell cultures. No effect of cough duration or age was observed with the detection of influenza A for the FilmArray and Clart Pneumovir tests or on the detection of influenza B with any method.",

For adenoviruses, metapneumoviruses and RSV, the explanation probably relies more on technical considerations. Indeed, false negative results with the FilmArray and the Clart Pneumovir tests were not always for samples with a low viral load, as indicated by the cycle threshold (which correlates with the viral load) of the third molecular technique used to elucidate discrepant results between the first two techniques. As an example, the mean Ct value and standard deviation of negative and positive samples for adenoviruses with Clart Pneumovir were 32.7 (1.6) and 31.8 (2.2) respectively (p = 0.402). The choice of primers and probes used to design tests can determine whether a certain strain of virus will be detected. Although the FilmArray test had a better sensitivity than the Clart Pneumovir test for the detection of adenoviruses, it may lack sensitivity in detecting certain strains, which could impact the management of immunocompromised patients (Song et al., 2016).",

Aspirates usually increase the detection rate for viruses over swabs (Loens et al., 2009). The decreased sensitivity of antigen detection and cell cultures when the duration of the cough increases is expected, because viral shedding is more important in the first days of the disease (Aoki and Boivin, 2009).

The main factors limiting a wide utilization of these techniques are cost and the difficulty to absorb the workload in large facilities with numerous samples to analyze per day. Another drawback is that latent viruses or traces of genetic material may be detected. The interpretation of a positive result might be difficult, and it must be carefully correlated to the clinical history of the patient as the presence of a virus in the respiratory tract is a factor exposing to bacterial superinfection (Vareille et al., 2011). It is possible to quantify the viral load in a respiratory sample, but there are conflicting reports regarding correlations between viral load and outcome (Granados et al., 2017; Wishaupt et al., 2017). Technical improvements should be made to prevent variation in quantification caused by sample dilution with saline instilled during aspirates or by the variable quantity of sampled material with swabs. These improvements could render comparisons between studies more reliable and permit the establishment of a threshold, above which detected viruses are indeed involved in an ongoing infectious process. In addition, a positive antigen detection test usually correlates with a high viral load in a sample, and a positive cell culture can only be achieved with infective viral particles. Whatever technique is used, fully understanding the benefits and limitations of each is crucial for interpretation. The choice of technique should depend, besides financial considerations, on the necessary sensitivity and speed based on symptoms, comorbidity and risk of a detrimental outcome for each patient. A tertiary care hospital should be able to offer diagnostic tools suitable for each individual case; if testing all patients with molecular techniques is not possible, the use of non-molecular techniques is preferable over nothing at all.",
