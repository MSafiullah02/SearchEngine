There is no time in history when virtually every aspect, whether human life, economies or politics among other things, has been affected by the rapid change brought through by developments in information technology (Harari 2018). Technological advances have allowed humanity to discover powerful energy sources, discover faster modes of transportation for humans, goods and services, improved the speed in which we communicate, landed human beings to the moon, and there is even an attempt to send a spacecraft on a mission to the sun. Technology has allowed human beings to have a better mode of diagnosing and even curing diseases. The speed to which the COVID-19 test was developed and deployed to deal with the pandemic that engulfed the globe in the first quarter of 2020 is testimony to this. Agricultural yields have also seen an improvement, owing to technological advances. In a sense, advances in technology have enabled humanity to conquer the barriers of nature. Life has certainly improved compared to our ancestors.",

Accordingly, the first industrial revolution brought mechanical innovations with the development of the steam engine, which was the key to the then industrial revolution. It was catalyzed by the scientific revolution of Isaac Newton, Robert Hooke and James Watt. The second industrial revolution started in the second half of the nineteenth century. It brought the oil-powered internal combustion engine, electricity, electric motors and electrical communication. There were major technological advances during this period, including the telephone, light bulbs, phonograph, the assembly line and mass production of goods and services.",

There are three types of artificial intelligence, and these are machine learning, computational intelligence and soft computing (Marwala 2009 ). Computational intelligence is the use of intelligent biological systems such as the flocking of birds or the colony of ants to build intelligent machines. Computational intelligence has been used successfully to create systems such as Google Maps that identify the shortest distances between two points (Marwala 2012) . For an example, a population of ants, shown in Fig. 1.1 , is able to build complicated anthills, shown in Fig. 1.2 . What sort of economics have these ants imagined in order to be able to build assets such as these? These ants have two mechanisms of building such a complicated economy, and these are: group intelligence and individual intelligence. In essence, what this means is that on its own (individual intelligence), the ant will struggle to put together such a structure, but collectively these ants are able to put together this complicated economy. This book studies how the rise of artificial intelligence would impact the economics and finance theories.",

Because deep learning depends so much on data, it is making data emerge as the most valuable commodity, thereby arguably surpassing oil. It has been established that artificial intelligence can be used effectively as a prediction tool. In their attempt to clear future uncertainties so that sound decisions can be made, agents use predictions as an input into the decision-making process, where economics and finance theories would have provided a framework in which agents make decisions on how to allocate scarce resources (Marwala 2013 (Marwala , 2014 (Marwala , 2015 .",

When society moved to the agricultural age, there was a problem that agricultural production was not consistent and, therefore, there was need to store food for the times of drought. The place where this storage happened was in the churches. The priests received food to store and in exchange gave a token (money). Societies are organized along the lines of money. The whole class system was fundamentally about money. The exchange of goods and services, usually using money, is what we call the economy. The dynamics of money in society is what we call finance. On understanding the economy and money, various models and theories were developed. Many of these models were not universally accepted, and, sometimes, schools of thoughts evolved along political ideological lines. In the United States, the Republicans and the Democrats are divided along the economic line. The democrats believe in what is called the demand-side economics where an economy can be stimulated to encourage aggregate demand. This is what Adam Smith called the invisible hand (Smith 2015) . The Republicans, on the other hand, believe in the supply-side economics where they believe in deregulation and a limited hand in the economy; in other words, Republicans advocate for lesser government intervention in the economy.",

For example, they studied the laws of demand and supply and observed that advances in AI are making the principles of demand and supply more individualized, leading to individualized pricing (Mankiw and Taylor 2011). They also studied the theory of rational expectations, which prescribes that on predicting the future, agents are not systematically wrong (Muth 1961) . Marwala and Hurwitz (2017) observed that the advances of AI make the theory of rational expectations more valid. When rational agents operate in the market, they do so in order to maximize their utility. The economic theory on the maximization of utility is called rational choice. Rational choice is based on the philosophical concept called utilitarianism (Friedman 1996; Mill 2001) . Research has shown that it is impossible for agents to be rational. The best agents can do is to be bounded rationally. Marwala and Hurwitz (2017) observed that AI and related technologies make the bounds of rationality flexible. It turns out that if such agents are people, they never maximize utility because doing so is a risky strategy and people have evolved to be risk averse. This is called prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) . Marwala and Hurwitz (2017) observed that the bounds of rationality are better off when agents are machines than when agents are human beings.",

In such a situation, the markets are inefficient. Marwala and Hurwitz (2017) have observed that the use of AI makes the markets more symmetrical and, therefore, improves market efficiency. Game theory is a mathematical technique that is used to understand the dynamics of a situation where agents interact. In game theory, agents interact under certain rules until they reach the Nash equilibrium (Osborne and Rubinstein 1994) . Unfortunately, the mathematics works well for interactions with fewer agents. AI is able to expand the number of agents that can interact in a simulation. The reverse of game theory is called mechanism design. While in game theory, we study the interactions of agents under some set of rules until they achieve Nash equilibrium (Nash 1950) , in mechanism design we have agents and know the desired Nash equilibrium and all we want to identify are the rules that will make that possible (Myerson and Satterthwaite 1983) . Mechanism design has been used for market design, incentive design and in the kidney exchange market. Marwala and Hurwitz (2017) used AI to implement mechanism design.",

Labour is also homogeneous within a country; however, this may be different across countries. The implication of homogeneous labour within a country with differences between countries implies that the production technology could be different between two trading nations. Technological advances have turned the world into a global village. In essence, the borders have essentially been flattened. AI will change the very nature of the Ricardian Theory in the sense that, as it evolves, AI flattens the borders and possibly reduces reliance on labour.

In the automated world, economic growth could be fuelled by robotic infrastructure. Because individuals would possibly have been replaced by the robotic infrastructure, growth would not be accompanied by employment opportunities. At the same time, since this could result in unemployment, the demand for goods and services could be expected to be put under pressure.

Since most information in a market-driven economy is transmitted through pricing, adverse selection will result in unfair pricing of goods and services and the unfair advantage on the part of the agent with more information. This chapter examines how the Adverse Selection theory will look like in a situation where the information is digitally and easily accessible by all parties in the transaction.

As technology improves, a \"gale of creative destruction\" is unleashed through the process of industrial mutation, where the economic structure is revolutionized without much intervention of the external forces. In the process of this revolution, old technologies are destroyed and new ones are created. We examine whether the creative destruction is a result of human inefficiencies, for instance, the lack of data, the inability to store crucial data, the inability to get insights on the data so as to learn about the previous behaviour of the agent and which of these factors hinders the owners of the destructed technology to pre-empt the next move that the agent is likely to take, while also providing basket options so that their technology remains relevant and moves with time. With the ability to store the information, learn about the previous behaviour of the agent and possibly pre-empt the next move that the agent is likely to take, while also providing basket options, AI would provide current technology holders with vital intelligence to remain competitive, relevant and timely, thus challenging the notion of Creative Destruction as it is presented with that of the Creative Modernisation.",

According To Kopp (2019) , the agency theory is a principle utilized in an attempt to explain the complex relationship that exists between the owners (principal) and managers (agents) of the business. Jensen and Meckling (1976) define the agency relationship as a form of contract between a company's owners and its managers, where the owners (as principal) appoint an agent (the managers) to manage the company on their behalf. This relationship is most commonly found between shareholders as principals and company executives as agents. Other similar relationships are found between financial planners and portfolio managers acting as agents on behalf of their clients, the investors, acting as principals, and a lessee acting as an agent on behalf of the lessor, and the property owner acting as the principal among others.",

This book focuses on how artificial intelligence redefines certain important economics and financial theories that are used for purposes of eliminating uncertainties so as to allow agents to make informed decisions. \u2022 With the simulated intelligence in machines, which allows machines to act like humans and, to some extent, even anticipate events better than humans, thanks to their ability to handle massive data sets, this book uses artificial intelligence to explain what these economics and financial theories mean in the context of the agent wanting to make a decision.",
