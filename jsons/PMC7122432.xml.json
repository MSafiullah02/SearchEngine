            "text": "Until the early 1970s, most biological NMR studies were still focused on small molecules, such as amino acids and oligopeptides. One of the crucial issues to be addressed in those days was the unambiguous discrimination of the side-chain \u03b2-methylene proton signals. Without the explicit stereo-specific assignments for the prochiral methylene protons, the two gauche conformations around the C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b2 bonds of amino acids, estimated by the Karplus relationship for the vicinal 1H\u20131H coupling constants, could not be distinguished unambiguously. We solved this long-standing problem for the first time by using amino acids with one of the prochiral methylene protons stereo-specifically deuterated, prepared by either enzymatic reactions or organic syntheses. By using stereo-specifically deuterated amino acids, we established the stereo-specific assignments for the prochiral \u03b2-methylene proton signals and thus discriminated the two gauche conformations for various amino acids and small peptides [5, 6] (Fig. 2.1). Despite our efforts, the approach along this line could not be extended for studying larger peptides or proteins, since no practical experimental methods to incorporate stereo-specifically deuterated amino acids into peptides or proteins were established at that time. As a matter of fact, more than 30 years after our early work, the idea blossomed into the stereo-array isotope-labeling (SAIL) method with the help of two emerging key technologies: chiral organic synthesis and recombinant DNA methods for protein expression [4].\n",

            "text": "During the 1970s, there was a multidisciplinary collaborative research group, known as the \u201cResearch Consortium on Streptomyces Subtilisin Inhibitor (SSI),\u201d which focused on SSI as a shared target, aiming to promote biophysical and biochemical protein research activities in Japan. SSI, which was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces albogriseolus, is a 23-kDa dimeric protein composed of two identical subunits, and it strongly inhibits serine proteinases, especially subtilisin family proteinases. One of the controversial issues for proteinase\u2013inhibitor interactions in the late 1970s was the state of the active site peptide bond, i.e., the \u201cscissile bond,\u201d in the inhibitors complexed with proteinases. X-ray crystallographic analyses of various proteinase\u2013inhibitor complexes initially concluded the existence of the \u201ctetrahedral intermediate,\u201d which was thought to be formed by a covalent bond between the active site Ser O\u03b3 of a proteinase and the carbonyl of a scissile bond. It was assumed that the tetrahedral intermediate was trapped due to the overwhelming stabilization by the \u201coxy-anion hole\u201d of serine proteinases, which serves as a molecular device to enormously accelerate the enzymatic hydrolysis of substrate peptides. However, this remarkable model, which was cited in most of the biochemistry textbooks at that time to highlight the beauty of the enzymatic functions of proteinases, was becoming dubious. Namely, as higher-resolution X-ray structures became available, they revealed that the atomic distance between the Ser O\u03b3 and the carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile bond was apparently a little too long to form the covalent bond. In addition to this serious concern, others still remained about the state of the proteinase\u2013inhibitor complex, which could not be solved by crystallographic studies, such as the following: Does it exist in solution as a single intermediate or as an equilibrium mixture of multiple intermediates? Is the scissile peptide bond in the complexes planar, as usually found for peptide bonds, or distorted by the effect of the nearby Ser O\u03b3? In principle, all of these questions could be investigated by solution NMR spectroscopy. However, it was difficult to think that such work was feasible since the molecular weight of the SSI\u2013subtilisin complex, 78 kDa, was too large. We overcame this problem by a unique isotope-labeling strategy, as described below [7].",

            "text": "Since the scissile peptide bond of SSI is formed between Met73 and Val74, its state in the proteinase complex would be precisely manifested by the 13C-NMR signal for the carbonyl carbon of Met73, if we could observe a single 13C-NMR signal for the 78-kDa protein. Although each of the two identical SSI subunits contains three Met residues, i.e., Met70, Met73, and Met103, their C-terminal neighbors are all different, i.e., Cys71, Val74, and Asn104, respectively. Taking advantage of this sequential diversity, we contrived the 13C, 15N double-labeling method to sequentially assign the three carbonyl carbon signals. By using SSI samples doubly labeled with [1-13C]Met and [15N]Cys, and with [1-13C]Met and [15N]Val, we should be able to discriminate the carbonyl 13C signals of Met70 and Met73 through the spin couplings between the directly bonded 13C and 15N, which are known to be about 15 Hz. As illustrated in Fig. 2.2, this strategy based solely on the amino acid sequence information worked perfectly [7]. In addition to the unambiguous assignment, this method provided even more crucial information about the state of the scissile bond in the SSI\u2013subtilisin complex, through the 13C chemical shift of Met73 and the 13C\u201315N spin coupling values between Met73 and Val74. We finally proved that the Michaelis complex with the intact, undistorted scissile bond is the only stable form of the SSI\u2013subtilisin complex in solution [8, 9].\n",

The method can be regarded as the historic prototype of triple-resonance sequential assignment methods, using uniformly 13C, 15N double-labeled proteins.

At that time, NMR technologies using uniformly 13C, 15N double-labeled proteins were firmly established, but they could only be applied to determine the three-dimensional structures of small proteins. However, a variety of key technologies, which were not available back in the 1970s, facilitated further innovations of isotope-aided NMR methods. For example, multinuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, chiral organic syntheses, and protein expression using recombinant DNA techniques were all quite mature techniques by then. Therefore, we had a unique opportunity to revisit the old idea to explore cutting-edge methods for studying larger proteins. In order to encompass the advents of various multidimensional NMR methods, we exploited novel synthetic routes for the regio- and stereo-specifically D, 13C, 15N triple-labeled amino acids. With the help of state-of-the-art chiral organic synthetic methods, together with enzymatic reactions and microbial fermentations, we actually successfully synthesized all of the protein component amino acids with a variety of labeling patterns [13\u201315]. Fortunately, with further support from a second CREST grant for another five years, we completed the development of the \u201cstereo-array isotope-labeling (SAIL) method\u201d by using those labeled amino acids. Although it took more than 30 years after our early work on the stereo-specific deuteration of amino acids and peptides, the SAIL method has been proven to be extremely useful for studying the structures as well as the dynamics of larger proteins, for which previous NMR methods were difficult to apply [16\u201319].",

Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate SAIL amino acids into a target protein while preserving their original labeling patterns. In this respect, conventional cellular protein expression using recombinant DNA may not be a good choice, since metabolic scrambling reactions and isotope dilution with unlabeled amino acids are not completely avoidable for some amino acid residues. All these problems are largely circumvented by using in vitro expression systems. Fortunately for us, the in vitro protein expression using the E. coli cell-free extract became available at around the time we nearly completed the synthesis of the SAIL amino acids. By using the cell-free extract prepared from the E. coli cells, we successfully prepared a sufficient amount of a SAIL protein for an NMR study. SAIL proteins, which are composed exclusively of SAIL amino acids, are typically obtained with ~10 wt% yields calculated from the amount of the amino acid mixture and show virtually no isotopic dilution or metabolic scrambling [23\u201325].",

            "text": "The NMR spectra of SAIL proteins actually exhibit profoundly better sensitivity and resolution, as compared to those of conventional 13C, 15N uniformly labeled (UL) proteins. Figure 2.4 shows such superior NMR features for the case of 17-kDa SAIL calmodulin (SAIL-CaM) [20]. By comparing the 1H\u201313C ct-HSQC spectra for SAIL- and UL-CaM, it becomes obvious that the 1H\u201313C cross-peaks are considerably sharper and well dispersed for SAIL-CaM (Fig. 2.4a) than for UL-CaM (Fig. 2.4d). A closer comparison of the methyl (Fig. 2.4b, e) and methylene regions (Fig. 2.4c, f) of the two proteins reveals that only one of the prochiral pairs shows up as an NMR signal in SAIL-CaM. The benefit of the universal stereo-specific deuteration for the methylene groups in the SAIL method can be illustrated for the \u03b4-methylene signals of the six Arg residues in SAIL- and UL-CaM (Fig. 2.4g\u2013i). Since the \u03b43 methylene proton is stereo-specifically deuterated in SAIL-CaM, the six observed \u03b4-CH signals can be unambiguously assigned to \u03b42-CH (Fig. 2.4g), while in UL-CaM, most of the Arg \u03b4-CH2 signals are completely overlapped for both the 1H and 13C dimensions, except for Arg-37 and 106, for which no facile stereo-specific assignment methods could be envisaged (Fig. 2.4h). Since similar problems are ubiquitously encountered in UL proteins for the methylene groups in other amino acid residues, only SAIL proteins provide accurate structural information for the side-chain moieties. The complete spectral analyses of SAIL proteins are usually quite straightforward, by using the standard triple-resonance pulse sequences with slight modifications [15].\n",

            "text": "The analyses of aromatic ring signals in proteins are generally very cumbersome or infeasible for UL proteins, due to their complex 13C, 1H spin systems. The situation becomes even more complicated when the flipping rates of aromatic rings influence the signal shapes. Nevertheless, the information about the bulky aromatic rings, which tend to be embedded in the hydrophobic cores, is extremely important for structural studies of proteins. Therefore, we expended a great deal of effort toward optimizing the isotope-labeling patterns of aromatic amino acids, to obtain all of the structural information for aromatic rings in straightforward manners [26\u201328]. Figure 2.5 illustrates the application of SAIL Phes with various labeling patterns, aiming toward analyses of the ring 1H\u201313C signals, as exemplified by the assignment of the 12 Phe residues in E. coli peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase b (EPPIb) [27]. The aromatic 1H\u201313C region of the ct-HSQC spectrum for EPPIb labeled with UL Phe (Fig. 2.5d) gives virtually no detailed information, due to the overcomplicated spin systems. In contrast, each of the HSQC spectra for EPPIbs, selectively labeled with \u03b4-, \u03b5-, or \u03b6-SAIL Phe, shows clean, well-resolved signals (Fig. 2.5e\u2013g). The \u03b4-, \u03b5-, and \u03b6-CH could be readily assigned by the NOE correlations between the \u03b4-1H and \u03b23-1H, HBCB(CG)HE, and HBCB(CGCZ)HZ sequences, respectively (Fig. 2.5a\u2013c). The most significant advantage of the SAIL Phes can be realized by comparing the spectra between the \u03b6-SAIL-labeled (Fig. 2.5g) and the \u03b4-, \u03b5-SAIL-labeled EPPIb (Fig. 2.5e, f). The \u03b6-CH signals in \u03b6-SAIL Phe-labeled EPPIb have line shapes that are invariant against the flipping rates, because the \u03b6-CH bond lies along the C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b3 bond, and thus they appeared as 12 discrete signals with almost the same intensities (Fig. 2.5g). In contrast, in the \u03b4- and \u03b5-SAIL Phe-labeled EPPIb, the 1H\u201313C HSQC spectra show very weak or no visible signals for F27, F110, and F123 (Fig. 2.5e, f). The results clearly indicated that the ring-flipping rates for these three residues are relatively slow, as compared to the chemical shift differences for the two \u03b4- and \u03b5-CH atoms on the opposite side of the ring. As the aromatic ring-flipping motions are perfectly degenerated conformational exchange phenomena, which can only be manifested by the NMR line-shape analysis, these SAIL aromatic amino acids are extremely valuable for studying large-amplitude dynamics in proteins (see Sect. 2.3.2).\n",

Therefore, SAIL proteins facilitate the automated assignment of the 13C- and 15N-edited NOESY spectra, with the concurrent structure refinement using the CYANA program adapted to SAIL proteins (SAIL-CYANA). It is important to mention that the substantially reduced proton density in SAIL proteins allows the use of a longer mixing time for collecting long-range NOE constraints, without spin diffusion problems. Taking advantage of the improved distance constraints and the unequivocal stereo-specific assignments for prochiral groups, the structures determined for SAIL proteins are accurate, as illustrated in Fig. 2.6 for some of the structures determined by the SAIL-CYANA method [20, 21].\n",

This two-step automated structure determination using the FLYA-CYANA program works well for small SAIL proteins, without additional human participation [29, 30]. We also tried to develop a fully automated structure determination method exclusively based on NOESY data, obviating the need to measure any other spectra than those necessary for the resonance assignment. This ambitious automated approach, which would be useful for determining a large number of structures as efficiently as possible, was actually utilized for two small SAIL proteins and yielded well-defined structures that coincide closely with those determined by the conventional method [31].",

            "text": "Larger proteins have numerous methyl groups in their Ala, Thr, Met, Ile, Leu, and Val (ATMILV) residues, which are widely distributed on their surface and interior regions. Therefore, the methyl signals are valuable probes for studying the structures and dynamics of proteins and protein complexes, if the individual methyl signals could be observed. However, this is not trivial especially for larger proteins, since they have so many ATMILV residues. For example, the 82-kDa protein malate synthase G (MSG) has 289 ATMILV residues that comprise approximately 40% of its 723 residues. Among them, the 160 ILV residues are especially useful as NMR probes, since the total of 317 ILV methyls accounts for as many as ~70% of the 446 methyl signals. Therefore, extensive efforts have been exerted to develop robust methods to observe and assign ILV methyl signals in larger proteins. Most of them employ region-specifically 13C, D-labeled precursors, such as [4-13C;3,3-D2]-\u03b1-ketobutyrate and [3-13CH3;3,4,4,4-D4]-\u03b1-ketoisovalerate (\u03b1-KIV), for preparing fully deuterated proteins except for the Ile (\u03b41), Val (\u03b31/\u03b32), and Leu (\u03b41/\u03b42) methyls, which are to be labeled with 13CH3 [36, 37]. However, since the racemic \u03b1-KIV precursor labels both of the prochiral methyls in Leu and Val residues, the observable number of methyl signals cannot be decreased, and the labeling rates are 50% or less. Therefore, the signal congestion for Leu/Val methyls could not be improved and the methyl\u2013methyl NOEs are significantly reduced. In order to compensate for the drawbacks of this Leu/Val precursor, a few new precursors for the stereo-specific methyl labeling of Leu/Val residues have been developed [38]. However, it is difficult to use labeled precursors to prepare any desired combinations for either one of the prochiral methyls in Val and Leu, since Val is converted to Leu biosynthetically, as shown in the metabolic map.",

            "text": "In the SAIL method, we synthesized SAIL Leu/Val, in which one of the prochiral methyls is stereo-specifically labeled with 13CHD and the other one with CD3. The SAIL Val/Leu can be incorporated into proteins by the in vitro expression system, using the E. coli cell-free extract (vide supra). Using the same protocols, we synthesized all four of the Leu and Val residues, in which either one of \u03b41/\u03b42 or \u03b31/\u03b32 in Leu and Val, respectively, is stereo-specifically labeled with 13CH3, and all of the other protons are fully deuterated, as shown in Fig. 2.7 [39]. These four stereo-specifically methyl-labeled Val and Leu, designated as \u03b31-Val (a), \u03b32-Val (b), \u03b41-Leu (c), and \u03b42-Leu (d), could be incorporated into proteins in any combinations by the conventional cellular expression using the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain. The incorporation rate for the labeled Leu into MSG at a 20 mg/L concentration was ~90%, but that for the labeled Val at 100 mg/L was only close to 80%. In order to increase the incorporation rates for Leu and Val at lower amino acid concentrations, we have recently developed an auxotrophic E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain [40]. The mutant was derived from the BL21 (DE3) strain by deleting the ilvD and leuB genes encoding dihydroxy acid dehydratase and \u03b2-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, respectively; therefore, it cannot survive in the absence of Ile, Leu, and Val. Using this auxotrophic E. coli strain, the incorporation rates of isotope-labeled Leu, Val, and also Ile into MSG were found to be higher than 95% even at a 10 mg/L concentration of each of the stereo-specifically methyl-labeled Leu or Val, or the region-specifically methyl-labeled Ile, without any observable scrambling [41]. The usefulness of the stereo-specifically methyl-labeled Leu and Val is clearly illustrated in Fig. 2.7e\u2013g. Figure 2.7e shows the methyl region of the 1H\u201313C HMQC spectrum of deuterated MSG labeled with a conventional precursor, [3-13CH3;3,4,4,4-D4]-\u03b1-ketoisovalerate. The spectrum showed 232 considerably overlapped methyl signals, including the \u03b41, \u03b42 methyls of 70 Leu residues (including one extra Leu in the His tag at the C-terminus) and the \u03b31, \u03b32 methyls of 46 Val residues. In contrast, the spectra in Fig. 2.7f, g for deuterated MSG labeled by \u03b41-Leu or \u03b42-Leu + \u03b31-Val, respectively, show almost no signal overlap. It may not be apparent from the spectra, but the methyl signals observed for the MSGs labeled by \u03b41-Leu, \u03b42-Leu + \u03b31-Val showed increased sensitivities, as compared to the MSG labeled by the \u03b1-KIV precursor, by a factor of 2. It is important to mention that any single-residue-labeled MSGs and also any combinatorially dual-residue-labeled MSGs can be prepared by using the four different stereo-specifically methyl-labeled Leus and Vals. The combinatorial methyl-labeling method using stereo-specifically isotope-labeled Leu and Val is especially useful for collecting the inter-residue methyl\u2013methyl NOEs at higher sensitivities, by a factor of 4, as compared to the precursor method. Actually, the Val \u03b31 and Leu \u03b42 combinatorially labeled MSG gave highly sensitive inter-residue methyl\u2013methyl NOE signals. Even if the signal overlap remains in the 2D 1H\u20131H plane of the 3D 13C-edited NOESY-HMQC spectrum for a combinatorially labeled protein, as illustrated in Fig. 2.7h, the 3D HMQC-NOESY-HMQC should have better resolution, as shown for the 2D 1H\u201313C plane, making good use of the wider dispersion in the 13C dimension (Fig. 2.7i). Obviously, further extensions of the combinatorial labeling method involving multiple regio- and stereo-specifically isotope-labeled amino acid residues would eventually approach the concept of the SAIL method.\n",

Since the frequency of LASBMs is within the millisecond to second region, such motions have attracted the interests of biophysicists in the context of biological functions and protein dynamics. The LASBM was initially implicated by the intriguing observations that the \u03b4- and \u03b5-protons for the Phe and Tyr aromatic rings in proteins showed time-averaged NMR signals. It was quite surprising, especially for most of the crystallographers back in the 1970s, that such bulky aromatic rings flip about the C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b3 axis so frequently, since they are often deeply embedded in the hydrophobic core, which was thought to be the most solid part of a protein [41, 42]. Ironically, until recently there have only been few cases in which the aromatic rings show discrete signals for the \u03b4- and \u03b5-nuclei of Phe and Tyr, due to slow ring-flipping rates [43]. Theoretically, it might be possible that the 1H and 13C nuclei at the \u03b4- and \u03b5-positions incidentally have identical, or nearly identical, chemical shifts and thus appear as a time-averaged single peak regardless of the flipping rates, although it is quite unlikely that such situations happen very often. Taking advantage of the simplified spin systems of the SAIL Phe and Tyr, we revisited the ring-flipping phenomena and found that there are actually many more cases showing flipping rate-dependent aromatic ring signals. Apparently, the aromatic rings in conventional protein samples have such complicated spin networks that such cases are rarely identified. Therefore, proteins selectively labeled by \u03b4-, \u03b5-SAIL Phe and Tyr would provide unprecedented opportunities to investigate LASBMs through the widely distributed aromatic rings in the hydrophobic interior and on the ligand-binding surface. In the following, we illustrate the application of the aromatic ring-flipping phenomena for characterizing the LASBMs within the binding interface in FKBP12\u2013ligand complexes [44].",

            "text": "The tight complexes FKBP12 forms with immunosuppressive drugs, such as FK506 and rapamycin, have long been used as models for developing various approaches to structure-based drug design. The regions of rapamycin and FK506 that bind FKBP are very similar to each other, but the opposite sides of them, which are referred to as the effector regions, are entirely different for the two drugs. Rapamycin and FK506 can bind to their targets, mTOR and calcineurin, only if they are complexed with FKBP12. Therefore, it is very interesting to understand the molecular mechanism by which FKBP12 activates these drugs to trigger their diversified biological functions by forming the ternary complexes. The aromatic ring cluster in FKBP12 forms an extremely hydrophobic, concave binding pocket, composed of Trp59, Tyr26, Phe99, Phe46, and Phe48, for the immunosuppressive drugs, such as rapamycin or FK506, with high affinities (Fig. 2.8). Although the interfaces between FKBP12 and these drugs are well defined structurally and are almost identical in the crystallographic structures of various complexes, our NMR studies have clearly revealed the existence of substantial large-amplitude motions in the FKBP12\u2013ligand interfaces that strongly depend on the nature of the drug. We have monitored these motions by measuring the rates of Tyr and Phe aromatic ring flips, and hydroxyl proton exchange for Tyr residues clustered within the FKBP12\u2013ligand interface. To do so, we prepared FKBP12 proteins selectively labeled by \u03b4-, \u03b5-, \u03b6-SAIL Tyr and by \u03b4-, \u03b5-SAIL Phe. Free in solution, all of the Phe and Tyr residues in the ligand-binding pocket of FKBP12 show time-averaged signals for their \u03b4- and \u03b5-CHs, due to their rapid ring-flipping rates. In contrast, in the ligand bound states, Tyr26 and Phe99 give two separated signals for their \u03b4- and \u03b5-CHs, due to the slow ring-flipping rates of these residues. In addition, significant decreases in the ring-flipping rates were observed for all of the other Tyr and Phe residues in the binding pocket, namely, Tyr82, Phe36, Phe46, and Phe48, as illustrated for the FKBP12\u2013rapamycin complex (Fig. 2.8). The rates of hydroxyl proton exchange were also measured for \u03b6-SAIL Tyr-labeled FKBP12 in the drug complexes, using the method described in the next paragraph. Pairwise comparisons between FKBP12 complexed with rapamycin and FK506 revealed that the hydroxyl proton exchange and the ring-flipping rates for Tyr26 are much slower in the FK506 complex than in the rapamycin complex, whereas the ring-flipping rates for Phe48 and Phe99 are significantly faster in the FK506 complex than in the rapamycin complex. The apparent rate differences observed for the interfacial aromatic residues in the two complexes confirm that these dynamic processes occur without ligand dissociation. We attribute the differential interface dynamics for these complexes to a single hydrogen bond between the \u03b6-hydrogen of Phe46 and the C32 carbonyl oxygen of rapamycin, which is not present in the FK506 complex. This newly identified Phe46 \u03b6-hydrogen bond in the rapamycin complex imposes motional restriction on the surrounding hydrophobic cluster and subsequently regulates the dynamics within the protein\u2013ligand interface. Such information concerning large-amplitude dynamics at drug-target interfaces has the potential to provide novel clues for drug design [44].\n",

The exchange rates are usually estimated by a time course of the amide proton signal intensity changes for a protein freshly dissolved in D2O. The information has made crucial contributions toward understanding the backbone dynamics and the folding\u2013unfolding processes of proteins in solution. In contrast, the hydrogen exchange rates for the polar side-chain groups, such as hydroxyl (OH) or sulfhydryl (SH), have not been studied extensively, because they are usually too rapid to be measured by the method used for the backbone amides. We have exploited an alternative approach for the facile screening of the slowly exchanging polar side-chain groups and the estimation of their hydrogen exchange rates with the surrounding water. We adapted our previous method for detecting slowly exchanging backbone amide hydrogens by the steady-state line shapes of the amide carbonyl 13C signals, in a protein dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of H2O and D2O [7, 8, 45]. In such an environment, the line shape of the amide carbonyl of the ith residue depends on the isotope shift values induced by deuteration for both of the (i + 1)th and ith amides and also on their hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange rates [45].",

To do so, we prepared proteins selectively labeled by \u03b6-SAIL Tyr, [3-13C; 3,3\u2032-D2]-Ser, [3-13C; 3-D]-Thr, or [3-13C; 3,3\u2032-D2]-Cys. These labeled proteins gave extremely sharp 1D 13C-NMR signals for the C\u03b6 or C\u03b2 under deuterium decoupling and thus were quite useful for estimating the isotope shifts on the C\u03b6 or C\u03b2 and then the hydrogen exchange rates for the slowly exchanging polar groups by the EXSY experiment. We found that quite a few Tyr, Ser, Thr, and Cys residues in various proteins, dissolved in a 1:1 H2O\u2013D2O mixture, actually exhibit slow hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchanging rates for their side-chain hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups. Interestingly, all of the polar groups identified by this method as having very slow hydrogen exchange rates form hydrogen bonds and give 1H-NMR signals in H2O [46\u201349]. Therefore, this approach is useful for screening slowly exchanging polar functional groups that are likely to play important structural roles in proteins. A typical example of a search for the Tyr residues in a protein, which might have slowly exchanging hydroxyl groups, is illustrated as follows.",

This particular type of SAIL Tyr has the optimal labeling pattern for observing the 13C signals of \u03b6-carbons most efficiently and is also convenient for making sequential assignments through the NOE and HSQC correlations between H\u03b23 and C\u03b6, as shown by the red and blue arrows. The three Tyr residues in the 18.2-kDa protein EPPIb labeled by \u03b6-SAIL Tyr gave three sharp signals in H2O and D2O solutions with the sequential assignment (Fig. 2.9b, top and bottom). The chemical shifts for the 13C\u03b6 signals in H2O appeared ~0.1 ppm downfield as compared to those in D2O, due to the two-bond isotope shift induced by the deuteration of hydroxyl groups in D2O. In a 1:1 H2O\u2013D2O mixture, the 13C\u03b6 of Tyr36 and Tyr30 appeared as two separate signals with equal intensities, corresponding to the Tyr residues with a protonated and a deuterated hydroxyl group, respectively. In contrast, the 13C\u03b6 of Tyr120 showed a single peak just in the middle of the chemical shifts observed in H2O and D2O solutions (Fig. 2.9b, middle). The results clearly show that the hydrogen exchange rates of the hydroxyl groups in Tyr30 and Ty36 are much slower than the isotope shift difference, while Tyr120 has a rapidly exchanging hydroxyl group. It is interesting to mention that we identified the hydrogen bonds involving the hydroxyl groups of Tyr30 and Tyr36 by NOEs, but Tyr120 is on the surface of EPPIb. We could also observe the hydroxyl proton signals for Tyr30 and Tyr36 in H2O at the chemical shifts identified by the NOE experiment [46].\n",

The substantially high cost of the SAIL amino acids is certainly one of the obstacles, but they will be more affordable if the SAIL method becomes routinely used. Cell-free protein expression, which is necessary to prepare proteins exclusively composed of SAIL amino acids, seems to be another barrier for most NMR laboratories with no such experience. However, the E. coli cell-free kit for preparing isotope-labeled protein samples for NMR is now available commercially at a moderate cost. Therefore, there are no major hurdles to trying out the SAIL method for structure studies of proteins. The SAIL method could be extended for solving precise structures of proteins as large as 100 kDa or even more, by further optimization of the relaxation properties of SAIL amino acids (Miyanoiri et al., unpublished). The applications of the SAIL method to solid-state NMR spectroscopy are also interesting, but they have just started [50].",
