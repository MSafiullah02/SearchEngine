The first approach of qualitative data analysis using \u03c72 or Fisher exact test pointed out the following characteristics: infant age (P < .001), underlying diseases (P = .009), hospital discharge or not after birth (P < .001). Indeed, some newborns and infants were hospitalized after birth and discharge of their mothers. Univariate and multivariate analyses through a logistic regression are shown in Table 2. The univariate analysis pointed out the following factors positively associated with P. jirovecii detection: distribution of age groups, specifically the 63-189-day group (third quartile) (P < .001, OR [IC 95], 42.2 [5.4\u2013332]) and the 90\u2013120-day group (P = .023, OR [IC 95], 51 [1.7\u20131498]), congenital diseases (P = .037, OR [IC 95], 2.4 [1.1\u20135.6]), viral infection (P = .035, OR [IC 95], 2.2 [1.1\u20134.7]), lower respiratory tract infection (P = .032, OR [IC 95], 2.5 [1.1\u20135.9]).

P. jirovecii presence and its detection in an infant by definition a child less than 2 years old, was considered to be related to first contacts with the fungus and consequently to be contemporary with primary infection. This definition of primary infection could be discussed because putative P. jirovecii reinfection could not be strictly ruled out in some cases. It is noteworthy that P. jirovecii was mainly detected in young infants and in only four infants over 1 year old. Thus, the concept of reinfection with P. jirovecii remains speculative.

These results were expected, considering recommendations of MLST for microorganism typing methods published elsewhere.21 The apparent diversity of P. jirovecii grew according to the increase in discriminatory power of the typing method used. Consequently, the unilocus and bilocus approaches showed that genotypes were common in infants and adults, whereas no MLST genotype was shared. These apparently contradictory results due to technological constraints make it impossible to conclude whether the acquisition/transmission cycle of P. jirovecii in primary infected infants and PCP adults are independent or not.",

The hypothesis can be ruled out, since only one MLST genotype (mtLSU3-CYB1-SOD2) identified in our infant population was also identified by Maitte and colleagues among adults developing PCP and monitored in another French University Hospital Centre.17 It is noteworthy that the genotypes in the two positive infants who had not left the hospital after birth (E029, E130) were different than those in infants who were discharged after birth (Table 3). This observation is consistent with a different source of P. jirovecii in this two-infant population. However, genotyping results should not be too conclusive considering the low numbers of patients for whom MLST was successful (13 PCP adults and six infants) (Tables 3 and 4).",
