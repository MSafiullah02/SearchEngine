In an effort to place these extensive lists of parts into a coherent framework that helps illuminate their functional and/or structural relationships and that can also help provide insight into how perturbations of the cellular or organismal environment lead to changes in cell or organism behavior, biologists have increasingly invested in building network models of these relationships. A network is an artificial construct that organizes complex multivariate relations in a structured format for systematic mathematical analysis and intuitive visual representation. Nodes and edges are the building blocks of any network, also called a graph, where nodes represent variables and edges represent relationships between the variables. As this is a fairly general concept, network analysis has been applied to several fields, including sociology, air\u2010traffic, electric power grids, and counter\u2010terrorism.1, 2, 3 In recent times, network analysis has also been applied extensively in biology, especially in computational and systems biology research.4, 5 In most biological networks, nodes are macromolecules, such as genes, RNAs, proteins, metabolites, or cells, and a given network can be composed of more than one type of macromolecule or cell. The edges in these networks can depict connections between entities under general or specific conditions, and can represent anything from a physical interaction to regulatory or functional relationships.",

Immune cells sense infection and other environmental cues through a variety of extracellular and intracellular receptors. Ligation of these receptors leads to signaling cascades consisting of many dynamic processes including signal\u2010induced protein binding, phosphorylation, degradation, and nuclear localization. These signaling events lead to changes in gene expression, and subsequently to the production of both effector proteins required to combat infection and proteins involved in regulation of the ensuing, potentially host\u2010damaging, response. The number of molecular players or variables involved in any such activity can vary from hundreds to thousands, making immune responses immensely complex. This complexity is amplified by the multiscalar nature of the immune system, as these signaling and transcriptional responses occur in the context of diverse and dynamic cell\u2013cell interactions. The different types of immune cells, from innate myeloid cells to lymphocytes, receive cues from different classes of receptors, produce distinct effector molecules, and depend on cues from each other as well as from the tissue microenvironment to respond appropriately. Pathogen invasion of host cells further exaggerates this complexity; while immune cells mount an inflammatory response to contain infection, pathogens attempt to evade immune recognition and modulate the host response by secreting a variety of virulence factors. The nature and magnitude of the host immune response is therefore dictated by extensive dynamic molecular and cellular interactions within and between host and pathogen, which can be represented by multiple types of networks.",

In addition to intracellular interactions, crosstalk between immune cells as well as their spatial organization and migration within tissues in vivo are critical to the effective development of innate and adaptive immune responses. These intercellular interactions, which are functions of space and time, are represented as networks in section Intercellular and Organismal Networks. Another unique aspect of immunity, i.e., host\u2013pathogen crosstalk, is represented as interaction between host and pathogen networks in section A Network Perspective of Host\u2010Pathogen Interactions (HPIs).

Technological breakthroughs and computer\u2010aided automation have enabled high\u2010throughput experiments and the efficient generation of large unbiased datasets that are particularly valuable for network construction. Molecular networks have also been created by manual curation of vast amounts of existing literature by domain experts. Although this process is painstakingly long and labor intensive, the resulting molecular networks are of good quality with low false\u2010positive rates. An alternate approach is to apply text\u2010mining algorithms to scientific articles and abstracts to predict molecular networks. As expected, this strategy may expedite the process of network construction at the cost of increased false\u2010positive rates.

Early studies utilized microarray\u2010based transcriptome analysis over multiple time points and clustering of genes with similar expression kinetics.68, 69, 70 In one such example, gene clusters from TLR4\u2010stimulated macrophages were mined for both induced TFs and for cis\u2010regulatory elements68 to identify a prominent group of genes regulated by activating TF 3 (ATF3).

Probable ATF3\u2010associated TFs were selected and potential transcriptional targets of the ATF3 regulatory complex were identified based on enrichment of ATF3, NF\u2010\u03baB, and associated TF\u2010binding sites within close proximity.

A combined P\u2010value based on both the time\u2010lag correlation and motif scanning was determined and TF\u2013gene cluster pairs were ordered based on this combined P\u2010value to construct a regulatory network that was further expanded through the inclusion of TF interaction data from publicly available sources. The inferred network of associations between TF genes and co\u2010expressed gene clusters was validated with targeted ChIP\u2010on\u2010chip experiments, and yielded insights into the macrophage activation program. One of the major findings was the identification of a novel regulator, TGFB\u2010induced factor homeobox 1 (Tgif1), which was only detected using the integration of both expression data and promoter scanning evidence. In another example, a combination of gene expression analysis and TF\u2010binding site motif scanning algorithms was used to infer a network of associations between TFs and target genes in macrophages activated with dsRNA.71 This network of associations predicted that a member of the forkhead family of TFs, FOXO3, acts as a negative regulator of the type 1 interferon (IFN) response, a linkage that was confirmed experimentally using FOXO3\u2010null macrophages. Genome\u2010wide ChIP\u2010seq analysis identified the IRF7 gene as one of the critical targets of FOXO3; this observation was functionally validated by gene deletion studies that in turn identified FOXO3 as a negative regulator of IRF7 transcription. FOXO3, IRF7, and type 1 IFN were further demonstrated to form a coherent feed\u2010forward regulatory circuit that was experimentally validated by ChIP analysis, in vitro functional assays, and in vivo during vesicular stomatitis virus lung infection of FOXO3 KO and IRF7 KO mice.

This overall approach identified 2322 significant regulatory connections and revealed the functions of 125 TFs, chromatin modifiers, and RNA\u2010binding proteins.

The same group has previously assembled and mathematically modeled a GRN that controls macrophage versus neutrophil cell fate choice and that accounts for the onset and resolution of mixed lineage patterns during cell fate determination.80 Another study has used a network perturbation approach to investigate causal influences or crosstalk between signaling modules involved in the cytoskeletal response of neutrophils to chemoattractant.81 More recently, network analyses have been employed to reveal a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1\u2010 versus M2\u2010polarization model.82 The authors generated a dataset of 299 macrophage transcriptomes by stimulating macrophages with diverse activation signals including PRR ligands, cytokines, and metabolic cues. Network analyses revealed common transcriptional regulators associated with all types of macrophage activation states as well as regulators related to stimulus\u2010specific programs. Finally, the Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) consortium database has been utilized to elucidate transcriptional regulatory networks that control lineage commitment and functional diversification of DCs (DC progenitor cells, lymphoid\u2010tissue, nonlymphoid\u2010tissue DCs, and migratory DCs) across the murine immune system83 (Table 1). Thus, network analysis of transcriptional and ChIP data has also aided in identification of GRNs underlying distinct immune cell phenotypes and cell states in homeostatic and activated conditions.",

A curated database of PPIs was used to construct a network model that connects known proteins of the IL\u201023R signaling pathway to the TFs whose function is dysregulated in IL\u201023R KO cells. The network's nodes were ranked based on a centrality measure, i.e., the fraction of IL\u201023R\u2010affected TFs downstream of that node in the network. SGK1 emerged as the highest ranking node suggesting that it acts both as a transcriptional target of IL\u201023R signaling and as a kinase that may mediate the transcriptional effects of the pathway. These predictions were tested by examining the differentiation and maintenance of Th17 cells in SGK1 KO mice, as well as in mice lacking SGK1 specifically in IL\u201017\u2010producing CD4+ T cells. The results showed that SGK1 was indispensible for IL\u201023R\u2010dependent stability and maintenance of Th17 cells. Furthermore, mice fed a high salt diet (SGK1 is salt\u2010inducible) showed a marked increase in the frequency of Th17 cells in the gut and developed a more severe form of experimental autoimmune encephalitis than mice fed a normal diet.

A network biology platform called CellNet has recently been developed to quantify how closely GRNs of in vitro engineered or reprogrammed cells resemble those of their in vivo counterparts, diagnose aberrant GRNs, and prioritize candidate transcriptional regulators to enhance cellular engineering.85, 86 The authors analyzed expression data from 56 published reports and using CellNet to compare the GRNs of in vitro engineered cells with those of their target cell types in vivo, and they found that cells derived via directed differentiation from embryonic stem cells more closely resemble their in vivo counterparts than products of direct conversion by ectopic expression of lineage\u2010specific TFs. They further discovered that directly converted cells fail to adequately silence expression programs of the starting population and that the establishment of unintended GRNs is common to virtually every cellular engineering paradigm. CellNet was used to spot aberrant regulatory networks and predict candidate transcriptional regulators that could be targeted for improving cell derivations. Experimental testing of these predictions showed that as predicted, improved B\u2010cell to macrophage conversion, both transcriptionally and functionally, was observed by knocking down the B\u2010cell regulators Pou2af1 and Ebf1. In addition, CellNet revealed an unexpected intestinal program controlled by the master regulator Cdx2 during conversion of fibroblasts into induced hepatocytes (iHeps), and experimental validation of this prediction showed long\u2010term functional engraftment of mouse colon by iHeps, thereby establishing their broader potential as endoderm progenitors and demonstrating direct conversion of fibroblasts into intestinal epithelium.",

Many proteins are targeted with exquisite precision to specific locations in the cell, or undergo rapid directed changes in localization that influence the outcome of or are essential to signal generation. In many cases, innate sensors and/or adaptors must relocalize to specific cellular compartments or intracellular membranes for optimal assembly of signaling complexes and effector function. For instance, TLRs signal from the plasma membrane or endosomes90; RIG\u2010I, MDA\u20105, and NLRP3 relocalize to mitochondria upon activation via association with MAVS91, 92, 93, 94; and NOD1 and NOD2 signal from endosomes.95, 96, 97 The nature of subcellular association can also influence the quality and duration of the response. This has been observed in the context of viral infection, where peroxisomal MAVS induces rapid IFN\u2010independent expression of defense factors that provide short\u2010term protection, whereas mitochondrial MAVS activates an IFN\u2010dependent signaling pathway with delayed kinetics, which amplifies and stabilizes the antiviral response.98 Thus, there is increasing evidence that organellar structures and intracellular movement are integral to the development of an effective immune response.

During a natural infection, pathogens present a cocktail of ligands that activate diverse cell surface\u2010associated and intracellular PRRs to initiate combinatorial signaling cascades99 (Figure 2). Crosstalk between these signaling cascades gives rise to multifaceted, pliable, and functional networks in which dynamic interactions between the underlying components dictate the quality, magnitude, and duration of the ensuing host response. In this context, each \u2018signaling pathway\u2019 linked to a PRR\u2010innate sensor is in reality a much more extensive multicomponent network comprised of several nodes representing constituent signaling molecules and edges representing the spatial, temporal, and functional connections between these constituents. The existence of such a multifactorial network composed of multiple innate sensors with some degree of functional redundancy may enable macrophages, DCs, and other immune cells to detect pathogens or danger with greater precision resulting in robust synergistic responses. For instance, synergistic inflammatory responses have been observed upon simultaneous stimulation of myeloid cells with different TLR ligands,100 TLR and NLR ligands,101 and TLR and CLR ligands.102 Crosstalk can also occur between PRRs and other receptors expressed by immune cells. For instance, dual B\u2010cell receptor and TLR and/or NLR engagement can fine\u2010tune functional B\u2010cell responses.103, 104 Similarly, crosstalk between PRRs and phagocytic receptors is indicated by the observation that phagosomal TLR agonists enhance major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II\u2013mediated antigen presentation.105 Additionally, synergy between PRRs and cytokine receptors can be inferred from the observation that IFN\u2010\u03b3 augments TLR\u2010induced gene transcription.106 Finally, transcriptional induction of some PRRs by microbial signals allows for sequential triggering of PRRs that may permit greater accuracy in mounting a response commensurate to the nature and extent of the threat while preventing excessive inflammation. For instance, triggering of TLRs is critical for priming NLRP3 expression and subsequent inflammasome activation.107 Thus, functional innate responses result from crosstalk within and between PRR, cytokine, phagocytic, and other pathways upon recognition of multiple antigens simultaneously presented by a microbe. Assessment of responses to combined rather than single stimuli is therefore an essential parameter that should be incorporated in the study of these complex signaling networks engaged by pathogens.",

The lymphatic system is a network of open\u2010ended structures that collect interstitial fluid that even under normal conditions extravasates into tissues.120 Interspersed along lymphatic vessels are LNs. These complex structures are classically considered the site where adaptive immune responses are initiated. However, it has recently been shown that a multicellular innate immune network is at play in the LN protecting the host from systemic dissemination of lymph\u2010borne organisms.121 In Figure 3 we graphically display this complex biological system in parallel with a network rendition of the intercellular connections. Under steady\u2010state conditions (Figure 3(a)) a heterogeneous population of innate immune cells is located in close proximity to the macrophages that line the subcapsular sinus, where lymph drains. The physical proximity of the innate cells and macrophages allows for efficient intercellular communication via secreted cytokines following a perturbation (i.e., infection with an intracellular or extracellular bacterium, e.g., as seen in Figure 3(b) and (c)). In the network rendition, we emphasize the spatial positioning requirements for effective intercellular interactions by only highlighting those nodes that can display a potential connection (dotted line) with the central node and graying out the others. Figure 3(b) and (c) represents the system after infection with an intracellular or extracellular organism, respectively. The sequence and timing of events is indicated by the gradual color progression from light gray (earlier events) to black (later events) and the thickness of the edges indicates the relative contribution of a particular pathway. For example, following infection with an extracellular bacterium (depicted in Figure 3(c)), the main pathway that is activated involves IL\u20101\u03b2 release from the subcapsular sinus macrophages, which in turn recruits neutrophils to the LN, culminating in containment of the infection.",

From a network biology perspective, HPIs can be conceptualized as crosstalk between two molecular networks: one corresponding to the host and the other to the pathogen. These molecular networks have specific points of interaction and quite often pathogen proteins mimic eukaryotic PPI domains to invade the host PPI network. For example, the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus contains domains that bind to SH2 and SH3 domains of the regulatory subunits of host PI3K.132 Other studies have shown that interaction between host and influenza A PPI domains can determine the virulence of the virus.133 Similar examples of host molecular mimicry exist in bacteria; for instance, interaction of the Escherichia coli type III effector protein espF with human sorting nexin 9 protein (SNX9) induces host membrane remodeling.134 These studies suggest that interactions between host and pathogen molecular networks are not random but rather well orchestrated, directed events that can influence both host and pathogen behavior.

Subsequently, genome\u2010scale PPI maps have also been generated for other viruses, such as hepatitis C,136 vaccinia,137 herpes,138, 139, 140 and SARS\u2010associated coronavirus.141 All these studies used Y2H experiments to identify the interactions.

For two members of the herpesvirus family, i.e., Kaposi sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus and varicella\u2010zoster virus, a comparatively large number of PPIs, 123 and 173, respectively, have been identified. Topological analyses of PPI networks of several viruses have revealed that nodes in viral PPI networks tend to form a single and highly connected module with many hubs and few peripheral nodes.139 This observation is in striking contrast to the network topology of eukaryotic PPIs that have few hubs and several peripheral nodes.62\n",

Some of these applications also provide sophisticated tools to visualize interactive HPI networks. As most of the databases mainly rely on similar sources, the results are expected to overlap. However, some discordance between the results is not completely unexpected. Some databases are tailored for host\u2010 and pathogen\u2010specific information. For example, GPS\u2010Prot156 stores only human\u2013HIV interactions, while PATRIC153 is a repository of bacterial interactions with many host species. A few recent studies have created meta\u2010databases, such as PHISTO,149 PHI\u2010base,150 and HPIDB,151 that combine interactions from a large number of host and pathogen species. Topological analysis of proteins involved in interaction of host and pathogen networks indicates that both bacterial and viral pathogens in general target hub and bottleneck proteins in host networks.147 These target proteins are associated with processes that help propagate infection or evade host defense mechanisms, for instance, evasion of apoptosis, inhibition of innate immunity, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.157\n",

Interactions between human proteins and several pathogen proteins have also been predicted based on interlogs, an approach that extends protein interactions based on sequence homology and orthology.160, 161 Because proteins usually interact through specific domains, algorithms for predicting domain\u2013domain interactions can help identify potential PPIs.162, 163, 164 For instance, computational prediction of short linear sequence motifs common to both HIV\u20101 and human proteins has provided the basis for understanding the interaction with and modification of the host PPI network by the virus.165, 166 To improve computational predictions, pipelines can be created that include combinations of the above approaches and impose additional constraints.157 For example, interaction between a pair of host and pathogen proteins can be predicted based on availability of interacting domain pairs from relevant databases. Once all such pairwise interactions have been predicted, the results can be filtered to retain only hub genes in the host PPI network, as these genes are the ones most likely to be targeted by pathogen proteins to gain access to the host network(s).",

The human TRN was downloaded from Ref 17. The network is displayed using the Cytoscape force\u2010directed layout. Each node in the network is a transcription factor (TF), and edges represent transcriptional regulation. As transcriptional regulation is directed, network edges are directional from a TF to its target. The network has 3107 nodes and 6887 edges. The network clearly shows a hierarchical architecture as observed in Ref 17. Only a small subset of TFs regulate most of the other TFs, which is obvious from the modularity of the network architecture. The network can be divided into regions that are either autocratic or democratic. In the autocratic regions, a TF is usually regulated by a single TF whereas in the democratic regions a TF is regulated by multiple TFs. Circles highlight some of the autocratic regions. (b) Human protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network. The network was downloaded from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and displayed using the Cytoscape force\u2010directed layout. Each node in this network is a protein. The edges of the network represent protein\u2013protein associations observed in the literature and manually curated in the database. As PPIs do not have directionality, the network edges are nondirectional. The PPI network has 9251 nodes and 38,869 edges, hence it is much bigger compared with the gene regulatory network (GRN). Unlike the GRN, the PPI network shows lack of hierarchy. (c) A schematic representation of a typical signaling network. Ligands are sensed by specific membrane\u2010bound receptors (R1 and R2) followed by signal transduction, often mediated by adapter proteins that associate with the effector domains of receptors. The complex signaling circuitry further propagates and processes the signal through multiple steps, including signal integration, amplification [for instance by phosphorylation (P) or dephosphorylation of specific mediators], and noise reduction.

Such sensing triggers differential downstream signaling (3), which in turn can be promoted by preexisting compartmentalization of innate sensors (e.g., TLRs on the plasma membrane or endosomes) or their spatial relocation to membrane\u2010bound organelles (e.g., relocation of RIG\u2010I and NLRP3 to mitochondria) that provide suitable platforms for optimal assembly of signaling complexes (4). This leads to activation and/or production of downstream mediators (5) such as transcription factors (e.g., NF\u2010\u03baB, AP\u20101, and IRFs) that translocate to the nucleus to promote transcription of target genes (6) followed by their translation, appropriate protein folding, and post\u2010translational modifications (7 and 8). Cellular proteins may localize to specific subcellular compartments based on their domain sequences, post\u2010translational modifications, or association with suitable chaperones (9). Intercellular and intracellular heterogeneity is an important regulator of the innate response (10). Rewiring of the above connections can be expected depending upon the nature of the immune cell encountered (e.g., macrophage, dendritic cell, neutrophil, T cell, or B cell) as well as variations between single cells of seemingly homogeneous immune cell populations (e.g., heterogeneity due to cell state, stochastic nature of molecular interactions, and/or subtle differences in gene or protein expression).
