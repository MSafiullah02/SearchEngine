Most of the infections in children were diagnosed from familial clusters. The main clinical manifestations in children were fever (76.1%), cough, followed by vomiting, diarrhea and other digestive system symptoms, and viral pneumonia-like changes in chest imaging (70.4%). Two critical cases that progressed rapidly to respiratory failure after onset have been reported in China, one with congenital heart disease and the other with bilateral hydronephrosis and calculus of left kidney (1, 4) . Compared to infected adults, children tend to have milder clinical symptoms, faster recovery, and better prognosis. On the other hand, the asymptomatic infected children may act as \"carriers\" and potentially shed virus and poses a serious challenge to people in close contact, especially pediatric medical workers. Notably, although positive viral nucleic acid test is the \"gold standard\", some cases need two or even three tests to be confirmed , so clinical \"false negative\" children with negative nucleic acid testing results may still be potential source of infection. It is suggested that in clinical suspected cases, continuous and repeated sample collections are need to improve the accuracy (4).",

            "text": "and suspected cases (N=1412) of children (3) . Suspected cases were identified based on two of the three following conditions after excluding influenza and other common respiratory infections: 1) fever or respiratory symptoms or digestive symptoms or fatigue; 2) normal or decreased white blood cell count with decreased lymphocyte count or increased C-reactive protein levels; 3) abnormal chest X-ray imaging (pneumonia-like changes) and ground glass opacities on chest computed tomography. Suspected cases meeting either one of the following criteria were defined as confirmed cases: 1). Nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens or blood samples tested positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid using realtime reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay; 2) Genetic sequencing of respiratory tract or blood samples is highly homologous Regarding laboratory tests, based on the several articles on pediatric patients cited above (1, 2, 4) and an all-age study with 1099 patients that included 9 patients aged 0-14 yrs (6) , no differences have been reported in clinical findings between children and adults. Lippi and Plebani et al has summarized laboratory findings from published literature (7) and we hereby show in Table 1 the characteristic laboratory findings in children. In the early stage of the onset, the total number of white blood cells in the peripheral blood was normal or decreased, the lymphocyte count decreased, and some patients had decreased albumin and increased liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, including increased CK and myoglobin and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Most patients had normal or slightly elevated C-reactive protein, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and normal procalcitonin. In severe cases, D-dimer as well as procalcitonin increases, ferritin levels increase and the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes decreases progressively (Table) These children could be potential sources of infection. The asymptomatic pneumonia found in pediatric patients indicates follow up for these patients should include pulmonary function assessment. To date, critical cases in children identified all hadunderlying conditions and progressed rapidly, so children with underlying diseases should be aggressively protected by early isolation. Although no laboratory evidence for mother-to-child vertical transmission has been found, the fact that up to 10% neonates born to infected mothers developed symptomatic COVID-19still suggests that vertical transmission cannot be ruled out and newborns from infected mothers should be isolated immediately after delivery to avoid postnatal exposure.",

One fatality of 14-year-old boy in Hubei province was reported. In contrast, Lu X et al.(5) reviewed symptoms commonly found in 1391 children confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection from a single center designated to treat infected children under 16 years of age in Wuhan. They found that 15.8% of the cases were asymptomatic, and the most common symptoms were cough, red throat and fever.

Some patients had temporary abnormality of myocardial enzymes and liver function (8). There were a number of neonatal infections reported, posing the question of possible mother-to-child vertical transmission. Chen et al (9) reported in 21 pregnant women with confirmed infection in late pregnancy, the amniotic fluid, placenta samples of mothers and pharyngeal swabs of newborns (collected twice in 24 hours) showed negative results for nucleic acid test. The pharyngeal swab nucleic acid tests of 14 neonates were also negative on day 5 and 10 of their hospitalization (9). Nevertheless, Zeng et al reported 3 neonates with symptomatic COVID-19 (9%) out of 33 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 (10). The authors suggested that since strict infection control and prevention procedures were implemented during the delivery, the route of vertical maternal-fetal transmission remains a possibility, despite that other studies found all samples from affected mothers, including amniotic fluid, cord blood, and breast milk, were negative for SARS-CoV-2 (9)(11),In summary, people of all ages are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections, with the propensity increasing with age and co-morbidities. Within the pediatric population, infants had higher rates of serious illness than children at older age. Most of the infections in children are familial clusters that are asymptomatic (up to 16%) or have mild symptoms (up to 51%).",
