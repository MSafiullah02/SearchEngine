Already in ancient times it was understood that humans could get sick from consumption of infected meat, and that keeping your animals healthy improved your own health. Our current health situation has much improved, simply by keeping animals healthy through good management and hygiene, vaccination programs and prudent drug treatment. Nevertheless, there are still many zoonotic diseases that threaten human health, including diseases hosted by all kinds of animals, ranging from wildlife to domestic animals, whether in companionship\u2014or agricultural setting. Given the large amount and the obvious close contact we have with animals by raising/hunting, slaughtering, and eating them or their products (e.g. milk, eggs), food animals and wildlife form the largest reservoirs and production grounds for emerging zoonotic pathogens. Caused to some degree by our modern animal production methods, we now increasingly use antibiotics also in animal production, both for treatment and for growth promotion, thereby contributing significantly to the occurrence of an emerging risk: Anti Microbial Resistant (AMR) bacteria.",

Basically, zoonotic diseases related to food animals can be separated into three groups: Diseases with a potential for global spread with a dramatic public relation potential, such zoonotic diseases are often caused by virus and have resulted in dramatic action, including political action in most countries, e.g. SARS, avian influenza, and swine flu. Other diseases relate to the industrialized food production chain and are broadly distributed in all such production systems, which are found in all countries, rich or poor. The prevention of these diseases need to be considered along the full production chain, but most countries have yet to deal efficiently with these zoonoses, including pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Finally, an important group of zoonotic diseases have been eradicated or drastically reduced in affluent economies through vaccination and culling policies or through introduction of hygienic management practices. In most poor settings these diseases are \u2018neglected diseases\u2019 which receive very little attention from national authorities or even international organizations.

The vast majority of infections with enteric zoonotic bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, and Yersinia enterocolitica, probably occurs through this route. For other zoonotic pathogens, direct contact between animals and humans may also be an important route of transmission, this could be the case for Brucella spp., Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) or some newer strains of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Bacteria from production animals are widespread in the environment, mainly as a result of their presence in manure. Thus, the environment and wild fauna also transforms into reservoirs of foodborne pathogens and resistance, and forms a source of (resistant) pathogenic bacteria into the food animals and human reservoirs. Although consumption of wildlife is not considered a major route in many developed countries, wildlife is consumed at a substantial level in developing countries. In addition, because of generally lower bio-safety levels in rural animal keeping, contact between humans and food animals may in general be more frequent in these countries. For instance, the general understanding now is that the SARS epidemic in 2003 originated in direct human contact with and/or consumption of, wildlife, or indirectly through contact between wildlife and domestic animals (Guan et al. 2003; Shi and Hu 2008). Wildlife holds a broad spectrum of diseases including some of the most deadly ones. For this reason also the consumption of wildlife animals, and the spillover of infectious diseases from wildlife to food/production animal, is of global importance.",

These zoonotic, global influenza outbreaks (H1N1 even characterized by WHO as a pandemic) spread very quickly either in the animals (H5N1) or directly in the human population (H1N1). Although the total human disease burden related to the endemic bacterial zoonoses are probably manifold higher than these influenza outbreaks, it is basically these relatively few (but clearly global) outbreaks that have put One Health on the global agenda. The failure to predict or even monitor disease spread in animals in order to link this to the prevention of disease in humans, presented regulators, and politician with a wake-up call regarding the need for cross-sectoral collaboration between the animal and human health sectors.",

            "text": "In contrast to the dramatic viral outbreaks, bacterial food-related zoonoses are usually occurring endemically in farm animals. These pathogens are found in most food animals produced in industrialized settings. It should be realized that most countries\u2014including most developing countries\u2014have a significant part of the food animal production in some sort of industrialized setting. Such settings are invariably linked to a number of important zoonotic pathogens, including Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli. These pathogens, while widespread and endemic and in reality causing a major global disease burden, are not often recognized as important human pathogens. Part of the reason for this is the absence of a One Health framework, a framework that could ensure cross-sectoral collaboration and data-sharing and thereby lay the foundation for a realistic description of the situation, as well as, of potential sensible solutions. There are some countries (especially in northern Europe) that have instituted cross-sectoral data collection for zoonoses, typically through a construction called Zoonosis Centers. The data sharing across animal, food, and human health sectors have enabled science-based solutions, resulting most noticeably in significant reduction in human salmonellosis through lowering Salmonella prevalence in animals (Wegener et al. 2003). These constructions and solutions are clearly following One Health principles, and have basically done so since 1994! Similar solutions would be relevant in all countries with industrialized food animal production, but it is noteworthy that efficient solutions in this (sometimes called commercial) part of a national production system often will have repercussions also down to the traditional poor farmer (sometimes referred to as the communal production system). For instance, Salmonella enteritidis entered Zimbabwe through imported animals (poultry) in the commercial sector around 1993, and thereafter spread quickly to the communal sector, as well as, to the human population (Matope et al. 1998). The background for this is most likely that old animals from the commercial sector are sold to communal production systems. And where the animal goes the pathogen goes\u2014therefore lowering the prevalence in the commercial sector would enable a reduction in prevalence also in the communal sector, thereby in turn lowering the human incidence of disease.",

Humans acquire Taenia solium tapeworms when eating raw or undercooked pork meat contaminated with cysticerci. The route of transmission is, pigs are infected through Taenia eggs shed in human feces, and the disease is thus strongly associated with pigs raised under poor hygienic conditions.

Food we eat today could have come from animals raised yesterday, thousands of miles away. To combat zoonotic foodborne zoonoses we need improvements and adjustments in our food production systems based on a global vision and approach. Internationally, different organizations have recognized that combating zoonoses is best done via a One Health approach. The World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), agreed a seminal paper: \u2018A Tripartite Concept Note\u2019 (FAO/OIE/WHO 2011) in which they express the need to collaborate for a common vision. Given the impact zoonotic disease have in particular on the most vulnerable sectors in our societies, the World Bank and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), as well as, the United Nations System Influenza Coordinator (UNSIC), share this One Health strategy to combat zoonotic disease (UN 2008). A One Health approach will open solution scenarios that are now not considered for treatment of the zoonoses problems because of the costs involved. For instance, while vaccination in some cases is the ultimate tool to prevent disease, it is often not considered because the costs of mass vaccination can be much higher than the public health benefit savings. Getting a true picture of the cost for the different stakeholders and setting up a framework for sharing of estimates of cost, as well as, mitigation strategies could likely enable (new) ways of reaching sensible solutions (Narrod et al. 2012).",

The decision to do so came after publication of the finding that 80 % of Enterococci in chicken were highly resistant to vancomycin, which is a last resort drug for human therapy (Wegener et al. 1999). The reaction to this dramatic finding was the initiation of a knowledge\u2014and collaboration platform to combat AMR: the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and Research Program (DANMAP) in 1995, supported by the Danish Ministries of Health, of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries and of Science, Technology, and Innovation.

One of the findings from DANMAP was that data on drug usage are essential for a good understanding of the problem. In Denmark, an automated program called Vetstat has been introduced to collect quantitative data on all prescribed medicine for animals from veterinarians, pharmacies, and feed mills (Stege et al. 2003). With this information, it has been possible for the Danish Veterinary and Food Authority (DVFA) to introduce \u201cThe Yellow Card Initiative\u201d (DVFA 2012). Like in a football match, farmers and veterinarians get a card when their antimicrobial use is excessive, and only by reducing the antibiotic use (for instance, by adopting management methods from low users) they can lose the card. This does not only work as a stick, it also gives the users a sense of how well they are doing compared to their colleagues. In the European Union, several countries now have started to collect similar data to compare antibiotic use at country level (EMA 2011).",

Such a database is needed and should be open to, and supported by, scientists from all fields: human health, animal health, and food safety, and should include genomic data for all types of microorganisms as well as meta-data to trace back the source of the microorganism. Building such a database is only possible through a One Health approach on all levels. There should be cooperation internationally, across sectors (e.g. human, animal, and food), as well as, between different stakeholders. Persuing such a major goal will not only be beneficial for the developed world, but maybe especially for developing countries. For them, genomic identification will be a giant leap forward in the fight against infectious diseases, and could be likened to the spread of cell phones, which made expensive and exclusive landlines unnecessary and made communication possible for everybody. Identification and typing of microorganisms will suddenly become technically and economically feasible, enabling control and prevention efforts previously missing in many regions. At the same time, developing countries moving to use this technology will not need to develop expensive specialized lab systems since microbiological lab work will basically be the same for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. If set up in a sensible, inclusive, open-source framework WGS analysis will provide the world with a strong weapon in the fight to combat infectious diseases in all sectors.",
