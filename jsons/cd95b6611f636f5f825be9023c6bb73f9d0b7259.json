            "text": "Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strains adhere with fimbriae to villous epithelial cells, colonize the small intestinal surface and elaborate heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable (ST, type a and/or b) enterotoxins, which stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-and/or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-mediated enteric fluid loss by inducing small intestinal hypersecretion. Treatment of secretory diarrhoea could be performed using drugs which inhibit this hypersecretion and/or stimulate intestinal absorption (Donowitz, Wicks and Sharp, 1986; Powell, 1986) . Neuroleptics, e.g. chlorpromazine, are reported to induce inhibition of CAMPmediated fluid secretion (Donowitz, Wicks and Sharp, 1986; Greenough and Rabbani, 1986) . Adrenergic receptor agonists, especially the aJ-agonists, are another promising group of potentially antidiarrhoeal drugs, acting primarily by increasing sodium and chloride absorption and by inhibiting bicarbonate secretion (Donowitz, Wicks and Sharp, 1986; Powell, 1986) . The fl-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, has been shown to be antisecretory for cholera toxin and dibutyryl cAMP in rabbit and rat intestine (Donowitz, Wicks and Sharp, 1986) . In animal studies verapamil, a well-known calcium channel blocker, increases basal ileal absorption of water, sodium and chloride. Some calcium channel blockers have also been shown to prevent secretion induced by cholera toxin and by ST-enterotoxin of E. coli (Donowitz, Wicks and Sharp, 1986) .",

The enteropathogenic viruses damage the small intestinal villi, resulting in villous atrophy and subsequently in small intestinal malabsorption (Moon, 1978) . The dual infection induces a more severe diarrhoea than the infection with ETEC alone (Tzipori, Chandler, Makin and Smith, 1980) . We therefore established a combined hypersecretion-malabsorption diarrhoea model in newly-weaned piglets by inoculating them with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, an enteropathogenic coronavirus, and ETEC. In preliminary experiments it has been shown that this combined viral-bacterial infection induces profuse diarrhoea and hypovolaemic shock, which provokes 100% mortality within five days (Cox, Cools, Charlier, Schrauwen and Houvenaghel, 1986) .",

The piglets were of mixed breed (Pietrain x Belgian Landrace). They were individually housed at 27 2 2\u00b0C and allowed to drink UHT sterilized whole cow's milk ad libitum. To enhance ETEC colonization of the small intestine, the piglets were orally pre-treated on days 1, 2 and 3 with chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin, Parke-Davis; 1875 mg/L milk). This pre-treatment with chloramphenicol renders the dual infection more severe (Cox, Schrauwen and Houvenaghel, 1986) , probably by making the gut more susceptible to ETEC (Kaufman, 1984) . After starvation for the first three hours of day 4, the piglets were orally inoculated with TGE virus (1.66 x lo6 pig infective dose/animal). Twenty-four hours later (day 5) the piglets were starved again for three hours, after which 62 ml of a 1.4% NaHCOs solution was given intragastrically to neutralize the gastric acidity and so prevent ETEC destruction. Fifteen minutes later they were intragastrically inoculated with 10 ml of a bacterial suspension of two ETEC strains. Both strains, 0,49:$1:s,a ; LT, STa and STb enterotoxin positive respectively, were grown on brain heart m usion E agar (Oxoid) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Bacteria were suspended and diluted in sterile physiological saline to an A,,,, of 0.4, approximately 1.2 x lo9 bacteria/ml as determined by viable count.",

Daily milk intake decreased (day 3, 1117 + 132 ml: day 6, 630 + 184 ml; p > O.OS), vomiting occurred in 50% of the animals (Table I) and there was a significant weight loss ( Figure 2 ) and decrease in body temperature (Table II) . Piglets became dehydrated as shown by bilateral retraction of the eyeballs and a decrease in skin turgor. Cyanosis of the extremities and depression occurred, and 77% of the animals developed hypovolaemic shock (Table I ). In the terminal stage some animals lay in lateral decubitus, with sunken flanks and a prominent pelvis. Mean survival time of shocked piglets was 3.3 + 0.5 days after TGE virus inoculation. The gross changes at necropsy were cyanosis of the extremities, a filled stomach, severe congestion of the gastric mucosa, watery contents in and congestion of the small intestine and sometimes of the colon, and petechial haemorrhages in the kidneys. Figure 2 . Weight change after a combined infection of newly-weaned piglets with TGE virus and ETEC (infected control group; n = 6) and effect of treatment with chlorpromazine at 2 mg/kg/24 h (chlorpromazine group; n = 5) or with clonidine at 80 pg/kg/l2 h (clonidine group; n = 6).

Significant differences from the values prior to infection (day 3) are indicated by *(p<O.O5); **(p<O.Ol) and ***(pc0.001) Treatment with the low dose of chlorpromazine at 1 mg/kg/24 h was without beneficial effect on diarrhoea score, vomiting or survival (Table I) . However, the larger dose of this neurolepticum, 2 mg/kg/24 h, resulted in a significant decrease in the diarrhoea score on day 7 (Figure l) , a complete inhibition of vomiting (Table I) , a less pronounced (p >0.05) weight loss ( Figure 2 ) and an increase, although not a significant one, in percentage survival (Table I) . Chlorpromazine administration, especially in the larger doses, also provoked marked sedation and a resulting further reduction in daily milk intake (340 + 118 ml on day 6, as against 630 + 184 ml in the control group; p >0.05), and a significantly more pronounced decrease in body temperature on day 6 (Table II) as compared to the control piglets. The decrease in body temperature was observed within one hour of the first administration of the neurolepticum and became more pronounced after the second. On the third day we therefore injected 1.5 mg/kg instead of 2 mg/kg.",

The mechanism of action of STb is still unclear. Recently rotavirus has also been shown to exert a role in the decrease of villous absorption (Tzipori, Chandler, Makin and Smith, 1980; Lecce, 1983) . Since rotavirus is enzootic in Belgian piggeries (Debouck, 1984) and the experiments were performed on conventionally bred piglets, TGE virus, another enteropathogenic virus, was selected to induce a combined viral-bacterial enteritis. Whereas rotavirus only infects the upper part of the villi, TGE virus multiplies in and destroys the major part of the villous epithelium (Moon, 1978) , resulting in more profuse diarrhoea and vomiting. In the very young piglets TGE is almost invariably fatal, whereas animals over three weeks old usually survive the infection (Aitken, 1983) . In the present study most dually infected piglets in the control group and also in some of the treatment groups developed hypovolaemic shock as a result of vomiting, induced by the TGE virus, and diarrhoea, probably induced by a combination of malabsorption (TGE virus) and hypersecretion (ETEC) (Cox, Charlier and Houvenaghel, 1988) . The diarrhoea occurring during the chloramphenicol pre-treatment can be explained by the change in diet from sow's to cow's milk, by the loss of maternal immunity, by environmental changes (Tzipori, Chandler, Makin and Smith, 1980; Lecce, 1983) and perhaps also by a direct effect of the antibiotic on the intestine. It has been shown that chloramphenicol suppresses the anaerobic gut flora thus probably increasing the intestinal susceptibility to potentially pathogenic micro-organisms (Kaufman, 1984) , whereas in calves a malabsorption diarrhoea has been reported following oral treatment with chloramphenicol (Mero, Rollin and Phillips, 1985) . We recently evaluated the effect of the chloramphenicol pre-treatment on our diarrhoea model. Four piglets were treated with chloramphenicol for three days and were subsequently not inoculated with TGE virus and ETEC strains. Faeces became pasty to semi-liquid in two animals during treatment. After treatment, however, diarrhoea resolved within one day (Cox, Charlier and Houvenaghel, 1988) .",

            "text": "In the last decade there has been steady progress in research on potentially useful drugs which can reduce fluid loss in secretory diarrhoea (Greenough and Rabbani, 1986; Powell, 1986) . These drugs, however, have never been tested in a combined secretion-malabsorption diarrhoea. In animals chlorpromazine inhibits CAMP-induced hypersecretion provoked by the LT enterotoxin of E. coli and Vibrio cltolerae, prostaglandins and dibutyryl CAMP, as well as cGMP-mediated hypersecretion due to the ST enterotoxin of E. coli (Liinnroth and Jennische, 1982, Donowitz, Wicks and Sharp, 1986) . This neurolepticum probably also stimulates intestinal absorption of sodium and chloride, as demonstrated for promethazine in the rabbit ileum (Cohen, Sharp and Donowitz, 1985) . In human medicine the beneficial effect of chlorpromazine as a therapeutic antisecretory drug was first reported in patients with severe diarrhoea due to cholera enterotoxin (Greenough and Rabbani, 1986) . However, sedation was a serious disadvantage in its clinical use. In newborn piglets with experimentally ETEC-induced diarrhoea, a single intramuscular administration of chlorpromazine at 5 mg/kg one hour after the onset of diarrhoea completely normalized the intestinal fluid content within four hours but seriously sedated the animals, whereas at a dosage of l-2 mg/kg there were no side-effects but an obvious antisecretory effect still occurred (Liinnroth, AndrCn, Lange, Martinsson and Holmgren, 1979) . These authors confirmed their findings in a field trial in which the duration of diarrhoea in a spontaneous outbreak due to ETEC was significantly reduced by a single intramuscular injection of chlorpromazine at 1 mg/kg in addition to oral electrolyte solution and standard antimicrobial agents. In our present study, in which no additional therapy was performed, we only observed significant antidiarrhoeic and antiemetic effects resulting in increased survival following the administration of 2 mg/kg/24 h of the neurolepticum for three consecutive days. However, it must be mentioned that the piglets in the present study were newly weaned and had been inoculated with an enteropathogenic virus prior to ETEC infection, resulting in a more pronounced small intestinal fluid loss. Sedation and suppression of vomiting are well-known pharmacological properties of neuroleptic agents (Booth, 1977; Baldessarini, 1980) . These drugs also induce hypothermia (Booth, 1977; Baldessarini, 1980) , which explains the significantly more pronounced decrease in body temperature in the chlorpromazine (2 mg/kg) group as compared to the control group. Despite important side-effects such as sedation, decreased daily milk intake and hypothermia, chlorpromazine at 2 mg/kg/24 h would probably be useful in the treatment of severe diarrhoea of mixed viral-ETEC origin in weanling piglets.",

In ligated jejunal loops in 2-week-old piglets this drug reduces the net secretion of water and electrolytes induced by the ST enterotoxin of E. coli (Ahrens and Zhu, 1982; Zhu and Ahrens, 1983) . The a2-adrenergic agonist, however, was without effect on the ST-induced increase in chloride efflux from isolated porcine enterocytes (Ahrens and Panichkriangkrai, 1985) . In a study on its antidiarrhoeal action in man, Schiller, Santa Ana, Morawski and Fordtran (1985) postulated that cloniclme has two actions which might contribute to this effect. Firstly, the drug directly stimulates the rate of intestinal water and electrolyte absorption both in vitro and in vivo by means of an a2-adrenergic receptor. Secondly, clonidine has been found to inhibit intestinal motility. In the present porcine study, administration of clonidine at 80 pg/kg/l2 h for three consecutive days resulted in beneficial effects on diarrhoea and survival rate. However, the drug also induced important side-effects such as decreased activity or excitation and incoordination, thus compromising its use as an antidiarrhoeal drug in practice. The sedative effects are similar to those of chlorpromazine (Blaschke and Melmon, 1980) . Our observations do not confirm the analgesic effects of clonidine previously reported in pigs, horses and man especially after epidural administration (Wintzer, Krause, Siedentopf and Frey, 1985; Gordh, Feuk and Norlen, 1986) .",
