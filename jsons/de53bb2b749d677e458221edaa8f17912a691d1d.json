We derive a two-dimensional diffusion model for the full temporal behavior of the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model on such a network, by making use of a time-scale separation in the deterministic limit of the dynamics. This low-dimensional process is an accurate approximation to the full model in the limit of large populations, even for cases when the time-scale separation is not too pronounced, provided the maximum degree is not of the order of the population size.",

The second is a dynamic limit (also called \"annealed\" or \"discrete heterogeneous\") in which the network is assumed to evolve much more quickly than the epidemic, and can be described by an effective network characterized by its degree distribution, in which all individuals sharing the same degree are considered equivalent. This case can be analyzed through use of a set of degree-indexed differential equations (often called the \"heterogeneous mean field\" approach) provided the maximum degree is not too large [14] [15] [16] .",

This type of network has the property that the basic reproductive ratio, which is found to be proportional to the second moment of the degree distribution k 2 , diverges in the limit of infinite populations, leading to the absence of an epidemic threshold. This is evidently not the case when the population-and thus the degree cutoff-is finite, but the second moment of the distribution can still be extremely large for sufficiently large N , and heterogeneity can play an important role in the dynamics of the system.",

V we perform a further reduction, which allows us to make contact with a model that has already been discussed in the literature. In Sec. VI these reduced models are used to find the distribution of epidemic sizes, and we conclude with a discussion of our results in Sec. VII.

In order to determine these in the general heterogeneous case, we look first at the homogeneous case, where K = 1. If we set an initial condition with only a few infective individuals in an almost completely susceptible population, we will have i(\u03c4 = 0) = i 0 1 and s(\u03c4 = 0) = s 0 \u223c 1, where s = s 1 and i = i 1 ; with this, the N \u2192 \u221e limit of Eq.

This is due to the fact that the initial number of recovered individuals is zero and that every individual that gets infected during the course of the epidemic will eventually recover and remain permanently recovered. Now, a significant simplification can be made in the deterministic limit of the heterogeneous case, which reduces the 2K dynamical equations to two equations (see Refs. [34] [35] [36] , which consider the static case). This is achieved by use of the Ansatz s k (\u03c4 ) = d k \u03b8 (\u03c4 ) k ; we also define \u03bb(\u03c4 ) such that \u03bb(\u03c4 ) \u2261 k ki k (\u03c4 ). With these two variables, Eqs.

While the new variables \u03b8 and \u03bb are justified mathematically through the fact that they simplify the equations, they also have a physical interpretation. For the case of \u03b8 , this is related to the recently introduced concept of a test node [12, 37] , which plays an analogous role in epidemic dynamics to the concept of a test charge in electrostatics. If we introduce a single initially susceptible individual with one link into the system, and assume that the population is so large that this individual has negligible influence on the epidemic dynamics, then \u03b8 (\u03c4 ) is the probability that such a \"test node\" has avoided infection at time \u03c4 . The quantity \u03bb is related to the force of infection that is defined in epidemiology as the per-capita rate at which susceptible individuals become infective [10] . Our \u03bb(\u03c4 ) is the network generalization of this, being instead the per-link rate at which susceptible individuals become infective at time \u03c4 . We therefore argue that where a nonnetwork SIR epidemic can have its dynamics represented in phase space with coordinates (s(\u03c4 ),i(\u03c4 )), for the network model the physically relevant coordinates, designed to account for link heterogeneity, are (\u03b8 (\u03c4 ),\u03bb(\u03c4 )).",

In this case, we would not expect the reduced model to yield accurate results. This is due to the fact that not even the full 2Kdimensional mesoscopic model [Eqs. (7) and (8)] provides a good approximation to the microscopic dynamics in this case, since K is of the order of N and this would need to be explicitly taken into account when performing the mesoscopic expansion leading to the Fokker-Planck Eq. (4). The implementation of the reduced mesoscopic model, however, is much more practical than that of the full mesoscopic model: while we have found that simulations of the latter take a time that, as its number of equations, grows linearly with the degree of heterogeneity of the network, for the reduced version this time, besides being much shorter, appears to scale as \u221a K. We end this section with some further observations regarding the reduced stochastic system. First, the existence of a (K \u2212 1)-fold degenerate eigenvalue equal to \u2212\u03b3 throughout the time evolution also means that stochastic trajectories, as well as deterministic ones, which venture out of the slow subspace will tend to be pushed back into the plane. Thus, we would expect the reduced set of SDEs to be a good approximation throughout the motion, and not just at late times. This may be the reason why the approximation works well even if is not particularly small. Second, in retrospect, the elimination of the fast variables in the stochastic system is not strictly necessary, since the SDEs previously obtained in Sec. III are recovered, and\u03c3 3 could be found in terms of \u03b8 and \u03bb using Eq. (43) obtained from the elimination of fast variables in the deterministic system. One can compare the value of\u03c3 3 in terms of the i k to the one in terms of \u03bb in the deterministic limit and see that, indeed, the approximation is not very good for moderate to large values of . This does not seem to play a huge role when considered as one of many terms in the stochastic evolution of \u03bb.",

(53) and (54)-is that, as discussed previously, there is an over-representation of very early extinctions in the case of the latter, and therefore the relative sizes of the leftand right-most regions of the distribution are not well captured. We would not expect our diffusion approximation to capture extinction probabilities accurately, given that its derivation implicitly assumes that the infective population is large and extinctions by definition involve small numbers of infectives. We can, however, derive accurate extinction probabilities from other results we have obtained.",

For each pair of individuals in the population, we pick whether infection will be spread between them if one becomes infective and draw a link between them if it will. This forms a static graph, and if we pick a node of the graph to be initially infective, then the size of the epidemic will be the size of the network component that the initial pick is part of. This means that the size of the giant component of the graph is equal to the final size of the epidemic if it is large, and the probability of early extinction is equal to the proportion of the population in the small components of this graph. Therefore, we can conclude that we have already calculated the probability of early extinction of the epidemic starting with an individual picked uniformly at random from a very large population; it will be equal to k s * k = G(\u03b8 * ). Figure 8 shows the distribution of final sizes from the reduced and semideterministic mesoscopic models, adjusted to account for the inaccuracy in early extinctions by removing these and assuming that a fraction G(\u03b8 * ) of epidemics stop early, and a fraction 1 \u2212 G(\u03b8 * ) take the values from the mesoscopic models. These results are compared to the distribution from the full model and show that the argument we have introduced provides a simple method to adjust for the inaccuracies in early extinctions, yielding an accurate approximation overall.",

The first of these is the size of the population, N , which is proportional to the dimensionality of the microscopic description. For large populations, this motivates the derivation of a mesoscopic model based on a diffusion approximation whose errors are controlled by inverse powers of N , and which we have formulated in this paper. The second of these is the maximum degree K, which is proportional to the dimensionality of the full mesoscopic model. We have been able to use fast-mode elimination techniques to derive two-dimensional approximations to this scheme: the reduced mesoscopic model, which involves three white-noise processes; and the semideterministic mesoscopic model, which involves only one white-noise process.",

Nevertheless, the reduction can be applied to cases with extremely large values of K, as long as they are not too close to N , thus significantly simplifying the original model. We have observed that the elimination of fast variables in the system provides a good approximation to the full dynamics even for relatively large values of , corresponding to a small separation between time scales. We have also shown that the main inaccuracy of the reduction, relating to very early extinction probabilities of the epidemic, can be dealt with using a simple argument. In this way, we hope to have provided a useful tool in the study of both infectious diseases and spreading processes on heterogeneous networks.",

However, in this case we do need the eigenvectors to be normalized to simplify the application of the reduction technique described in Sec. IV. This requires finding the corresponding left-eigenvectors. When finding these, we have a complication given by the fact that there is one eigenvalue, which is (K \u2212 1)-fold degenerate, and the condition Eq. (41) will not necessarily hold in general. However, if we construct a matrix V in such a way that its ith column corresponds to v {i} , we can choose u {j } to be the j th row of the inverse matrix V \u22121 , if such an inverse exists. We find that indeed this is the case, and the left-eigenvectors in the partially reduced model are then given byWe note thatUsing this property, we can verify that the orthogonality condition Eq.
