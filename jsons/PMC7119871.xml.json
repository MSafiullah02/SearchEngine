The syndrome mainly produces stillbirth, piglet mortality and respiratory disorders on all categories of pigs. After a severe pandemic phase, the disease has become endemic in many pig-producing countries, with a majority of herds being persistently infected for several years (Stevenson et al., 1993). The persistence of the virus within pigs and herds (Zimmerman et al., 1992; Albina et al., 1994) is often associated with the recurrence of secondary infections (Blaha, 1992; Stevenson et al., 1993). Therefore, PRRS virus has been suspected to have immunosuppressive effects on pigs.",

            "text": "Many researchers have investigated under experimental conditions the possible effects of PRRSV on the disease resistance of pigs. Their results were often contradictory. Some authors evidenced a negative effect of PRRSV when pigs were super-infected with Streptococcus suis (Galina et al., 1994), Mycoplasma hyorhinis (Shimizu et al., 1994; Kawashima et al., 1996), porcine respiratory coronavirus or influenza virus (Van Reeth et al., 1994, Van Reeth et al., 1996a). Others did not show any interaction between PRRSV and Pasteurella multocida (Cooper et al., 1995), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Albina et al., 1995; Van Alstine et al., 1996), Haemophilus parasuis, S. suis or Salmonella cholerasuis (Cooper et al., 1995). Recently, Van Reeth et al. (1996a)reported that PRRSV effects on pig resistance to influenza virus challenge were not reproducible from one experiment to another. Several reasons, including differences in individual pig susceptibility, could explain such a variation. However, the time interval existing between the challenges seems to play a major role. Van Reeth et al. (1996b)recently confirmed that the clinical incidence of a dual infection with PRRSV and influenza virus were more pronounced when the challenges were distant from 7 days instead of 3. Furthermore, when challenges were 14 days apart, the clinical outcome was not worse than with single virus infection.",

Presumably, these effects are restricted to the lung, the initial site of virus replication. All the studies published so far demonstrate that local and systemic immunity of pigs is restored within 2 to 3 weeks after PRRSV infection. However, the virus persists for longer periods and to our knowledge, nothing has been yet documented on the possible effects of PRRSV on the immune system of pigs during this persistent infection.",

The first experiment was designed to evaluate PRRSV effects on anti-PRV antibody production after immunization with PRV glycoproteins, and on subsequent disease resistance after a virulent PRV challenge. The second experiment was a reproduction of the first trial, but including pigs of different health status (Table 1\n). The last experiment was finally carried out to investigate the effects of PRRSV on lymphocyte subsets and on delayed type hypersensitivity. Pigs were allocated to 8 experimental groups and submitted to different treatments as described in Table 1. Each group was housed in separated isolation facility. PRRSV challenge consisted in the administration of 3 ml in each nostril of strain SDRPI5D titrating 100 tissue culture infective doses (TCID) 50/ml, followed one week later by intravenous injection of 5 ml of the same strain titrating 104 TCID 50/ml. This strain was an eighth passage of a Spanish isolate recovered from a sick piglet (generous gift from Dr. Plana Duran, Sobrino Laboratories, Cyanamid). It has proved before to be highly pathogenic for pregnant sows and young piglets (Plana Duran et al., 1992). Two weeks after initial PRRSV infection, the pigs were immunized intramuscularly with 2 ml of a commercial anti-PRV vaccine. This vaccine consisted of purified PRV glycoproteins in water/oil adjuvant. At 17 weeks old, the pigs were challenged intranasally with PRV strain AUJII3K titrating 106.1 TCID 50/ml (3 ml in each nostril). The inoculum was a clarified culture supernatant of primary pig kidney cells infected with a second passage of the strain 75V19 isolated by Andries et al. (1978). During the whole experimental period, the pigs were observed daily and any clinical manifestations were noted. Rectal temperatures and pig weights were respectively recorded daily and weekly. Blood samples were collected weekly. Nasal swabs were collected after PRV challenge as indicated in the results. At the end of the experiments, the pigs were anaesthetized intravenously with 20 mg/kg of thiopental sodium (Nesdonal, Rh\u00f4ne M\u00e9rieux, France), then bleeded. At necropsy, gross lesions were eventually recorded.",

An antibody-capture-ELISA was developed for the titration of serum immunoglobulins. Briefly, polystyrene 96-well flat-bottom microtitre ELISA plates (Nunc maxisorb) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a rabbit anti-swine immunoglobulins G (heavy and light chains) (Biosys, France) appropriately diluted in carbonate buffer (pH=9.6). The plates were washed five times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Merck, France). Two-fold serial dilutions of test sera were applied for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Serial dilutions from 6600 to 1.61 ng/ml of a swine IgG purified in the laboratory by salt precipitation, gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography, were included as a standard in each microtitre plate. After incubation, the plates were washed five times with PBS\u2013Tween, then a rabbit anti-swine immunoglobulins (light and gamma chains) (Dakopath, France) was added for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After five washings with PBS\u2013Tween, the substrate orthophenylene\u2013diamine (Sigma, France) was added into each well and the coloration allowed to develop for 15 min at room temperature. Absorbance was read at 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader (MR 7000, Dynatech, France). The concentration of serum immunoglobulins was calculated from the alignment of sample and standard titration curves. Results from one assay to another were standardized by the application of a corrective coefficient deduced from the alignment of the purified IgG titres. Anti-PRRSV antibodies were titrated by the immunoperoxydase monolayer assay (IPMA) developed by Wensvoort et al. (1991), secondarily adapted in our laboratory (Baron et al., 1992). PRRSV-neutralizing antibodies were titrated with or without the addition of 20% fresh swine serum, according to the method described by Yoon et al. (1994). Anti-PRV antibodies were titrated using an immunoperoxydase technic derived from the IPMA. PRV-neutralizing antibodies were titrated according to the method described by Vannier et al. (1991).",

            "text": "PRRSV infection of pigs under experimental conditions often leads to a long-lasting viraemia. We found in previous experiments that a double challenge one week apart with low doses of PRRSV generated a long-lasting and reproducible viraemia in infected pigs (data not shown). Our results effectively demonstrate that a long-lasting infection is consistently achieved, the infected pigs remaining viraemic for 5 to 6 consecutive weeks. As initially foreseen, all the PRRSV-infected pigs were viraemic when PRV immunizations were carried out, i.e. 14 days after the initial infection. At this time, it was assumed that the acute effects of PRRSV on the immune system of pigs had disappeared (see below). However, the virus was still present in the blood circulation, with possibly, additional incidence on the immune functions. The establishment of a persistent infection could result from the inability of the anti-viral defences to control the virus replication. In the present report, we confirmed that PRRSV is a poor and late inducer of neutralizing antibodies (see also Yoon et al., 1994). Recently, Yoon et al. (1996)established that virus neutralization in vivo requires a minimal titre of serum neutralizing antibodies. The log titre that efficiently neutralized the virus in vivo was estimated to be 2.8. Such a titre was achieved by a passive transfer of concentrated PRRSV-specific IgG (Yoon et al., 1996). Since the neutralizing antibody titre in the sera of convalescent pigs is generally lower (maximum log titre was 1.49 in our study), it can be assumed that neutralization in vivo is not an effective immune response for controlling the virus infection. In contrast, low amounts of neutralizing antibodies have been shown to significantly enhance the duration and the level of viraemia in pigs or the infection of alveolar macrophages in vitro (Yoon et al., 1996).",

            "text": "In the present study, we have observed an increase of CD2+ and CD8+ cells at weeks 3 and 4 after PRRSV infection. Levels of CD8+ cells were still higher in PRRSV-infected pigs than in uninfected pigs, at week 5 PI. The increase of CD2+ cells is likely to be due to the increase in CD8+ cells, since the latter express both markers. Our results are fully in agreement with those of Shimizu et al. (1996)who also demonstrated an increase of CD8+ cells on days 28 and 35 PI. The origin of this change is unclear. It is apparently not a direct effect of the virus on the CD8+ cells, since PBMC do not proliferate in vitro when they are inoculated with PRRSV (Shimizu et al., 1996). This result suggests that intermediate immune effectors are necessary to induce CD8 cell proliferation. These effectors which remain to be identified, could consist of helper cells or immuno-stimulating cytokines induced by the virus. The biological significance of this change in CD8+ cell numbers infected pigs is not well understood. Interestingly, viraemia starts to decline shortly after the proliferation of these CD8+ cells. The possible connection between these two events suggest that CD8+ cells could play a role in the control of virus replication. CD8+ cells are precursors of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CTLs are efficient immune effectors, with an important role in the elimination of virus-infected cells. Whether the proliferation of these CD8+ cells in PRRSV-infected pigs corresponds to the generation of a high number of PRRSV-specific CTLs or results from a non-specific polyclonal activation, remains to be elucidated. Recently, Bautista et al. (1996)reported that the cell immune responses against PRRSV were not detectable before 4 weeks PI and reached their maximum on week 7. These cell responses involved mainly CD4+ but also CD8+ cells. They also arose at a period of time PI which was consistent with the expected time of virus clearance. This observation would support our first hypothesis concerning the importance of these immune cells in the control of virus replication. The fact that efficient immune responses against the virus developed lately after the initial infection, also opens an interesting field of investigations on virus evasion strategies. In this area, a direct inhibitory effect of the virus on the normal anti-viral immune responses should be first considered.",

The origin of this change is not clear since the number of blood lymphocytes was not significantly decreased. This would suggest that PRRSV induced a low and transient suppression on lymphocyte functions in vivo. Since no definite proof of PRRSV replication within lymphocytes has been provided so far, we can also hypothesize that the infection may indirectly affect the lymphocyte functions by the generation of cytokines with potential suppressive effects. In other experiments, PRRSV has been shown to induce, 3 and 7 days after infection, a significant reduction of the number of blood lymphocytes and of their proliferative responses in vitro (Christianson et al., 1993; V\u00e9zina et al., 1996). Taken together, these results suggest that PRRSV may have a negative effect on the pig immune system, during the acute phase of infection. However, the real significance of this effect on the immune competence and disease resistance of pigs is yet to be determined.",

If the increase of WBC can be merely explained by the increase of CD2+/CD8+ cells (see above), however, the reason for the change in IgM+ cells is not presently understood. Another surprising finding was the increase in serum immunoglobulin concentration from 3 to 8 weeks PI. Whether these modifications rely on a polyclonal activation of B cells followed by a differentiation in antibody-secreting cells and then an increased production of antibodies, has to be confirmed. In their study, V\u00e9zina et al. (1996) observed a spontaneous in vitro proliferation of blood lymphocytes collected from PRRSV-infected pigs. This polyclonal activation in the absence of mitogens occurred with blood samples collected at 7 and 14 days after initial infection, suggesting that a viral protein may act as a mitogen or a superantigen on some lymphocyte sub-populations. In this study, the lineage of the proliferating cells was not determined.",

Since PRRSV was not detected in the pig sera when the secondary anti-PRV response arose, we assume that PRRS acted, in some way, in up-regulating the degree of the primary response to PRV glycoproteins, leading subsequently to an enhanced secondary response. Although the anti-PRV antibody response and delayed type hypersensitivity were obviously not increased after PRV immunization, the concentration of serum immunoglobulins and the amount of WBC, CD2+/CD8+ and IgM+ cells were however enhanced in PRRSV-infected pigs. Therefore, it can be anticipated that PRRSV has stimulated at least one component of the immune response raised against PRV glycoproteins. This component which remains to be identified would have ultimately led to an improved secondary antibody response. The studies of Molitor et al. (1992)and Brun et al. (1994)also support a virus-dependent enhancement of the humoral immune responses of infected pigs. These investigators have reported that PRRSV could actually enhance the antibody production after immunization with inactivated PRV and Brucella abortus antigens, or after a virulent challenge with influenza virus.",

In contrast with PRRSV, PRV infection has led to pronounced effects on many immunological and clinical parameters. Our results with PRV are in agreement with those of Page et al. (1992). These authors demonstrated that PRV challenge resulted within 6 days in an increase of polynuclear cells and a pronounced lymphopenia. In addition, CD8+ cells and CD4/CD8 ratio decreased during the week after challenge. These alterations support a general immunosuppressive effect of PRV, as reported elsewhere (see review of Chinsakchai and Molitor, 1994). Thus, PRV appears to be more detrimental than PRRSV for the immune system of pig. Interestingly, the incidence of PRRSV infection was similar on SPF and conventional pigs. However, total and differential WBC counts and anti-PRV antibody production were higher in conventional pigs compared to SPF pigs, whereas daily weight gains were lower. These discrepancies may result from the improved health status of SPF pigs for which the immune system is less reactive and the growth is generally better.",

The antibody production was not enhanced, immune cell distributions remained unchanged, immunization against PRV glycoproteins and subsequent disease resistance to a virulent PRV challenge was not adversely affected. Our study supports and extends previous findings which concluded that PRRSV had no effect on immune responses of pigs and subsequent disease resistance to various microorganisms (Cooper et al., 1995; Van Reeth et al., 1996b). The apparent increased disease susceptibility of PRRSV-infected pigs, as reported elsewhere (Galina et al., 1994; Van Reeth et al., 1996a), could be ascribed to the local disruption of the first lines of defence. This disruption could be due to the virus replication in alveolar macrophages and the consequent local inflammatory reaction. Recurrent secondary infections, observed in some herds, could be explained by successive phases of acute infection in new susceptible pigs, thus, facilitating the establishment, the proliferation and the dissemination of any opportunistic pathogens.",
