The Polyomaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has proposed that the Polyomaviridae family will be comprised of three genera: two genera containing mammalian viruses (Orthopolyomavirus and Wukipolyomavirus) and one genus containing avian viruses (Avipolyomavirus)\n[1]. Besides the HPyVs that were discovered more than 40 years ago (JCPyV and BKPyV), several new polyomaviruses have been discovered over the last 7 years in human clinical samples, namely WUPyV\n[2], KIPyV\n[3], MCPyV\n[4], TSPyV\n[5], HPyV6 and HPyV7\n[6], HPyV9\n[7], HPyV10\n[8] and MWPyV\n[9], STLPyV\n[10], and HPyV12\n[11]. Based on pairwise percentage identity of the viral protein-1 (VP1) open reading frame, members of the same species have more than 90% identity, between species identity ranged from 61 to 85%, and viruses belonging to different genera have less than 61% identity\n[6]. The primate virus SV40 has been detected in human samples\n[12], but there is inadequate evidence about the relationship to human carcinogenesis\n[13]. The recently discovered human virus (HPyV9) is closely related to the African Green Monkey Lymphotropic PyV (LPyV)\n[7,14], and this discovery might explain the previously observed serological evidence that LPyV-like virus infections may occur in humans\n[15,16].",

Currently, the STRATIFY JCPyV ELISA is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved assay for JCPyV\n[22], while all the others are lab developed tests for \u2018research use only\u2019.

Indeed, analysis of JCPyV polyprotein for peptide sharing with the human proteome revealed that the virus has hundreds of pentapeptides sequences in common with the human proteins\n[26]. This type of immune-evasion may contribute to the asymptomatic character of the primary infection, and subsequent latency.

The distribution expressed in number of matches of hexa- and hepta-peptides follows a similar pattern, but a very different one as compared to the pentapeptides (Figure \n1a). The degree of uniqueness and the sharp drop with increasing number of matches on the human genome suggest that hexa- and hepta-peptides are likely to be HPyV-specific. Consequently, if an epitope would encompass 6 or more amino acids in one continuous stretch, this epitope is also likely to be HPyV-specific. However, for the penta-peptides, the distribution is rather different, as only 9.25% of the peptides were found to be unique to polyomaviruses. The remaining 90.75% of peptides have at least one or more matches with the human proteome. There were 939 penta-peptides, 11 hexa-peptides, and 2 hepta-peptides with more than 30 matches in the human proteome (not shown); these motifs were often stretches containing 3 to 6 identical amino acids, like for example hexapeptide AAAAAA in the HPyV7 VP1 carboxyterminal region (\u2026 356SSNAAAAAAKISVA370P\u2026), which was found 2,364 times in the human proteome.",

The difference between each subset is significant (p < 0.05). The 95% CI on the slope were within 0.14 and 0.18. In addition, Table \n1 provides the slopes and intercepts for each protein and virus separated. When ranking the groups according to the steepest slope, KIPyV and JCPyV were seen as the 2 most important contributors to the overall slope. Despite the fact that agno had only a small amount of unique peptides, the slope turned out to be very steep. In contrast, the slope was rather shallow for BKPyV and SV40, and stAg. The Y-intercept was highest for stAg (2.09, in agreement with the observation in Figure \n2). In conclusion, microarray peptides with one or more embedded polyomavirus penta-peptides with no human homologue showed a higher signal on the microarray, and therefore are likely to represent viral-specific epitopes.",

Opposite to stAg is the observation for VP2, for which it seems like there is an evolution towards an \u2018as high as possible\u2019 \u201cself\u201d (host) content, thereby reducing the immune response. This is unexpected, because VP2, as minor part of the - in majority VP1 composed - viral structure, must be one of the first proteins that are recognized by the immune system upon infection or exposure. A potential explanation might be that VP2 is crucial in structure and function, and therefore has to evolve towards a protein that is not or poorly immune-dominant (a pressure that is not or less evident for stAg).

Our results however suggest that there is already a significant amount of antibodies build against these motifs in healthy volunteers, and thus it seems like a redundant approach to target unique pentamer motifs. Figure \n3 also shows that there is a large fraction of peptides without unique pentapeptides that nevertheless showed high median signal intensity. This can be explained by either the fact that it does not need to be unique to be an epitope, or that the reactivity is against embedded linear epitopes that are 6-mer, 7-mers, or longer. An antibody response against a non-unique domain would be seen as an auto-immune response. The recent development of antigen microarray chip technology for detecting global patterns of antibody reactivities makes it possible to study the natural autoimmune repertories within healthy humans, the so called \u2018immunological homunculus (immunculus)\u2019\n[31]. The immunculus is considered as the general network of constitutively expressed natural auto-antibodies against extracellular, membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear self-antigens (ubiquitous and organ-specific). The repertoires of natural auto-antibodies are surprisingly constant in healthy persons, independent of gender and age, and characterized by only minimal individual peculiarities\n[31,32]. Our approach however does not allow concluding whether the signals were against larger epitopes, or against \u2018self\u2019 domains and be part of the \u201cimmunculus\u201d. Therefore, we cannot exclude that auto-antibodies for peptide motifs encoded in the human proteome are responsible for the cross-reactivity (immunological homunculus), or that some of the microarray signals could be explained by non-specific binding (see below).",

The biological meaning of the presence of antibodies against linear HPyV epitopes is unclear. One hypothesis might be that, besides the viral particle that presents conformational epitopes to the immune system, there is quite some presentation of degraded viral protein in form of small peptides, and in case this is a unique motif (= unique pentapeptide), the immune system is building a detectable immune response. It is of particular importance to note here that we could illustrate the presence of antibodies against linear epitopes \u2013 mainly against viral unique pentapeptide fraction \u2013 against not only VP1, but also LTAg, stAg, and VP2, proteins that are only present as a consequence of a replication cycle (and not merely exposure).",

Some confirmatory examples will be published elsewhere. In our opinion, the only way for future validation of all these possible epitope regions is by careful selection of significantly contributing peptides, and testing them on validated peptide microarray platforms. Despite the research progress that has been made by using peptide microarrays\n[27,35-37], there is still hesitation to use these arrays beyond the initial screening, because of possibilities of a-specific reactivities, lack of reliable relation between signal intensities and antibody affinities, lack of array production reproducibility, and intra- and inter-assay variability. In order to evaluate larger panels of donors, patients, and certain risk groups against a large panel of HPyV peptides, array optimization will be required. Despite this, several other groups have tried to use peptide microarrays to miniaturize the antigen-antibody interaction while simultaneously studying several peptide sequences, e.g. in the field of GB virus C, Herpes simplex, and human coronaviruses. They concluded that antigenic peptides could be considered useful tools for designing new diagnostic systems with often sensitivities in the range of low- picomolar concentrations of mAbs and with a high specificity\n[38,39]. However, while evaluating our results, we were absolutely aware of the shortcomings of the initial experiments.

A correlation between the presence of unique pentapeptides motifs embedded in 15-mer peptides and the signal obtained on the microarray was presented. Under the assumption that a linear epitope could be as small as a pentapeptide, on average 9.3% of the polyomavirus proteome is unique and could be recognized by the host as non-self and it is specifically against these 9.3% of unique motifs that the immune response has been seen.",

Polyomavirus protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database. The 6 best covering sequences for each protein of each virus was calculated. The following proteins were included: agnoprotein (agno), small T antigen (stAg), large T antigen (LTAg), VP1, VP2, VP3 of the viruses BKPyV, JCPyV, KIPyV, WUPyV, MCPyV, and SV40. In addition, the VP1 protein of the viruses HPyV6, HPyV7, HPyV9, and TSPyV were also presented. For JCPyV VP1, a 100% coverage of published variants were covered by peptides, while for all other proteins, a coverage of at least 95% was obtained. This resulted in an array of 4,284 15-mer peptides, overlapping by 11 residues. Each peptide was displayed in triplicates on one single array chip (3 sub-arrays). The peptide microarray was incubated with a primary antibody or subject serum, followed by incubation with a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. Read-out was done by scanning the array by means of a fluorescent microscope. Several control incubations (no primary antibody) and control spots (human IgG) were included. The full procedure of the assay was as described by the microarray provider (JPT, Berlin, Germany). The triplicate quantitative values for each peptide were averaged, and one single value used for further analysis. All imaging and data manipulation was performed as described by JPT Innovative Peptide Solutions (Berlin, Germany). The data presented in this manuscript are log2(test peptide/control) values, derived from the original fluorescent values. Mapping (annotations) of the peptides was done against reference NCBI database sequences: JCPyV MAD1 (AAA82102, AAA82101, AAA82099, and AAA82103 for LTAg, VP1, VP2, and stAg, respectively), BKPyV Dunlop (CAA24300, CAA24299, CAA24297, and CAA24301), SV40 (YP_003708382, YP_003708381, YP_003708379, and YP_003708383), KIPyV CU-258 (ACB12028, ACB12026, ACB12024, and ACB12027), WUPyV CU-302 (ACB12038, ACB12036, ACB12034, and ACB12037), and MCPyV HF (AEM01097, AEM01098, AEM01099, AEM01096).",

Every 15-mer was scanned against every human protein and only exact matches were taken into account to compute the number of hits. The peptide array data were annotated with these hits and the joint information was used for all subsequent analyses. For all analyses involving micro-array intensities, the values were expressed as log2 (sample/control). Despite the transformation, the data still displayed slight skew (to the right). In order to take this into account, methods that are robust against such skew as well as outlying values have been used throughout the analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed using base R\n[40]. Comparisons of medians made use of linear rank methods as made available in\n[43]. The assessment of the relationship between presence in the human genome and signal intensity on the microarrays made use of robust linear models with MM-type estimators as implemented in Rousseeuw et al., 2011\n[44].",
