Despite the CT scan being the gold standard for the pneumonia diagnosis, we focused only on CXR images due to its reduced cost, fast result and its general availability, since the CT scan machines are still scarse and costly. Specifically, we considered pneumonia caused by viruses (COVID-19, SARS, MERS and Varicella), bacteria (Streptococcus) and fungi (Pneumocystis). Moreover, because of the recent pandemic which is ravaging the world, the main focus of this work is the COVID-19 pneumonia, and our principal goal is to reach the best possible identification rate for it among other types of pneumonia and healthy lungs. To support that, we have taken into account two perspectives in the results\u2019 evaluation: first, we considered all classes mentioned above and summarized the results using a macro-avg F1-Score; second, we considered only the COVID-19 class and summarized the results using F1-Score.",

In this way, each CXR image has a single label associated with it. In the second scenario, we address the problem as a hierarchical classification problem, since we can structure the different kinds of pneumonia based on the kind of pathogens that caused it [10].

In this situation, it is common that the classification algorithm increases the likelihood of the most frequent classes and reduces the likelihood of the least frequent classes [11].

Thus, for the flat classification, using the extracted features, we applied some well-known multi-class classification algorithms. In parallel, we also applied a hierarchical classification approach on the same set of extracted features. It is worth mentioning that we also tried a pure deep learning (end-to-end CNN) approach, however the results were very bad, probably due to the small sample size and the class imbalance.",

The variants of LBP evaluated were Local Ternary Pattern (LTP), Eliptical Binary Pattern (EBP), and Elongated Quinary Pattern (EQP). These descriptors were evaluated on three different medical applications: i) pain expression detection, starting from facial images of the COPE database [31], taken from 26 neonates categorized into five different classes (i.e. rest, cry, air stimulus, friction, and pain); ii) Cell phenotype image classification using the 2D\u2013Hela dataset [32], a dataset composed of 862 single-cell images distributed into ten different classes (i.e. Actin Filaments, Endsome, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Golgi Giantin, Golgi GPP, Lysosome, Microtubules, Mitochondria, Nucleolus, and Nucleus); and iii) Pap smear (Papanikolaou test) aiming to diagnose cervical cancer. They used a dataset composed of 917 images collected at the Herlev University Hospital [33] using digital camera and microscope. The images were labeled according to seven different classes, being three of them related to normal states, and four of them related to abnormal states. After a comprehensive set of experiments using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the authors verified that the EQP descriptor, or ensembles created using variations of EQP performed better for all the addressed tasks. For this reason, we decided to investigate the performance of EQP in the experiments accomplished in this work.",

The authors describe three main steps for generating the representation histogram. In the first step, from multiple input image scales and using Directional Gaussian Derivative Filters, extremum responses are computed. These extremum responses are used to feed linear and non-linear operators to quantitatively construct a set of transform features. This characterizes structures of local textures and their correlations with the input image. In the second step, the quantization is performed using various levels or binary threshold schemas. This step aims at greater robustness in terms of changes in lighting and rotation. Finally, in the third step, a joint cross-scale coding schema is carried out. In this way, it is possible to add discrete texture codes in a compact histogram representation. The authors describe LETRIST as a robust descriptor for different texture classification tasks [51]. We can also point out that it is robust to Gaussian noise, changes in scale, rotation and lighting. In this way, LETRIST becomes a very interesting texture descriptor.",

However, surprisingly LPQ has shown to be quite effective also to describe the textural content even for images not affected by blur. This descriptor is constructed by taking the coefficients that reveal the blur intensity of the image. It is done by using the phase of 2D Short Term Fourier Transform (STFT) over a window with a previously defined size, which is slid over the image. The mathematical details regarding the LPQ can be obtained in [54].",

            "text": "The BIF descriptor was originally designed for texture classification [55], but it also performs well in other tasks [56]. Gattal et al. [57] proposed an extension of the BIF descriptor. The main idea is to categorize each location in the image into one of seven possible local symmetry classes. These types of local classes are the following: flat, slope, dark rotational, light rotational, dark line on light, light line on dark or saddle-like. To categorize each part of the image, six Derivative-of-Gaussian filters are used, which is determined by the \u03b1 parameter. The parameter \u03b5 classifies the location probability as flat. The feature vector generated through the oBIFs descriptor has 23 dimensions. The orientations were quantified at four levels (n=4). Newell and Griffin [56], [57] propose a change in the oBIFs descriptor aiming to improve its performance. In this sense, the rationale is that from two different oBIFs descriptors (using different parameters \u03c3 and \u03b5), it is possible to produce oBIFs column features with (5n+2)2 dimensions. Thus, the number of dimensions was increased from 23 to 484.",

As shown in this section, we are dealing with a highly imbalanced database, in which half of the labels has between 10-12 samples. Thus, if we use a 10-fold or 5-fold cross-validation (the most recommended values by the research community), most labels will have only one or two examples into each fold. This division would have a high impact in the testing phase, which may lead to misleading results regarding the evaluation measures.
