            "text": "Successful vaccination campaigns have led to the global eradication of smallpox in the 1970s. As a result, it is now estimated that more than half of the world's population is naive to any smallpox infections. This has raised public concerns of potential bioterrorism use of smallpox or other types of poxvirus as biological weapons (Henderson, 1999). At the same time, the original smallpox vaccines can no longer be produced due to the safety concerns over the traditional manufacturing process. Newer generations of vaccines made from further attenuated vaccinia viruses and grown in tissue cultured cells have shown promising immunogenicity in their initial studies (Artenstein et al., 2005, Earl et al., 2004, Weltzin et al., 2003, Wyatt et al., 2004). However, more studies are still needed to establish the scale-up production of these vaccines and to confirm their safety profile in larger human populations. Although vaccinia virus is a potent vaccine and has the distinct ability to produce long lasting immunity in humans (Crotty et al., 2003, Demkowicz et al., 1996), the nature of its protective antigens has just begun to be revealed (Fogg et al., 2004, Hooper et al., 2004, Pulford et al., 2004). The corresponding epitopes involved in the activation of host immune responses at the B and T cell level that lead to protective immunity are much less understood.",

Both DNA and recombinant protein vaccines using individual outer membrane proteins of vaccinia virus elicited protective antibody responses in both small animal and non-human primate models (Fogg et al., 2004, Hooper et al., 2004). A 4-antigen DNA vaccine formulation including two intracellular mature virion (IMV) antigens (encoded by L1R and A27L genes) and two extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) antigens (A33R and B5R) from vaccinia virus was able to protect mice against intraperitoneal vaccinia virus challenge (Hooper et al., 2003) and subsequently to protect rhesus macaques against monkeypox virus challenge (Hooper et al., 2004). Similarly, the \u201cABL\u201d formulation with 3 recombinant poxvirus proteins (A33, B5 and L1) produced from the baculovirus system was also able to protect mice against lethal intranasal vaccinia challenge (Fogg et al., 2004).",

First, polyvalent formulations were needed for protection. None of these individual outer membrane proteins, when used as a monovalent vaccine, was able to elicit a protection in mouse model against poxvirus challenge as effectively as the vaccinia vaccine. Second, multiple immunizations were required to achieve protection. The efficacy of protection in mice receiving the 3 recombinant proteins (\u201cABL\u201d formulation) became close to that of positive control using poxvirus vaccine (VV-Wyeth) only after 4 vaccinations (Fogg et al., 2004). Similarly, 4 to 5 immunizations were needed for the 4-valent DNA vaccine formulation in non-human primates to reduce the disease severity to mild or moderate levels while the one-time DryVax immunization could achieve more complete control of the disease progression (Hooper et al., 2004). Therefore, it is necessary to improve the current subunit-based poxvirus vaccines before committing them to a large scale human testing.",

It is possible that a live attenuated vaccine can induce better T cell responses which may either provide T helper function to enhance the magnitude or quality of protective antibody responses or add cytotoxic T cell component to the mechanisms of protection. It is also highly likely that additional antigens which were not included in the recently reported subunit-based poxvirus vaccine studies may be able to further improve the protection against a complicated pathogen such as smallpox by expanding the breadth of protection when included in an improved polyvalent formulation.",

Among nearly 200 proteins of vaccinia virus, at least six were reported to elicit neutralizing antibodies (Pulford et al., 2004). They are A27 (Rodriguez and Smith, 1990, Ramirez et al., 2002), L1 (Franke et al., 1990, Ichihashi and Oie, 1996, Wolffe et al., 1995), D8 (Hsiao et al., 1999), B5 (Law and Smith, 2001, Engelstad et al., 1992, Engelstad and Smith, 1993), H3 (Lin et al., 2000, Chertov et al., 1991, Davies et al., 2005) and A17 (Wallengren et al., 2001). Antibodies against A33 were able to inhibit comet formation (Galmiche et al., 1999). While most of these antigens (A27, L1, B5 and A33) have been studied in various subunit-based, polyvalent poxvirus vaccine formulations (Fogg et al., 2004, Hooper et al., 2003), D8 has not been included in such studies.",

Antibodies to D8 were detected in mice after immunization with vaccinia virus (Demkowicz et al., 1992). Replication of vaccinia in brain tissues was significantly reduced when D8L gene was inactivated in recombinant viruses (Chernos et al., 1993). A recombinant D8 protein produced from E. coli expression system with modified gene sequence induced neutralizing antibodies that were able to block vaccinia infection to BSC40 cells (Hsiao et al., 1999). DNA immunization with D8L construct induced partial protection against vaccinia challenge in a mouse study although the overall immunogenicity of poxvirus DNA vaccines in that study appeared low with poxvirus-specific antibodies detected only in some but not all of D8L DNA-vaccinated mice (Pulford et al., 2004). No neutralizing antibody activities were reported with D8L DNA vaccine. More importantly, it is not clear whether D8 will be able to further improve the protection of other previously reported poxvirus antigens when included as part of a polyvalent formulation.",

In order to produce a more immunogenic form of D8L DNA vaccines, two versions of D8L gene inserts were produced (Fig. 1A). The first one was the full length coding sequence of the wild type D8L gene (wtD8L). For the other version (tPA-D8L), the transmembrane (TM) region and its downstream cytoplasm tail were removed, and a human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence was added to the N terminus of D8L coding gene. The wild type D8L gene does not encode a natural leader sequence. In our previous DNA vaccine studies, tPA leader was able to increase the secretion of HIV-1 Env and SARS-CoV S proteins and their immunogenicity (Wang et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2006). A similar approach of adding a leader sequence and removing the TM region was reported effective in achieving a good expression of D8 as a recombinant protein (Hsiao et al., 1999).",

It was clear that the tPA-D8L DNA vaccine had a higher level of expression than the wtD8L construct (Fig. 1B). The tPA-D8L was particularly effective in increasing the secretion of D8 antigen to supernatants. The apparent molecular weight of tPA-D8L protein was higher than wtD8L in supernatant, suggesting the involvement of more post-translational processing steps for this modified D8L gene design. One possibility is the glycosylation of D8 protein since tPA-D8L has three putative N-glycan sites (N29, N94 and N144). Further treatment of transiently expressed tPA-D8L proteins with PNGaseF indeed reduced the molecular weight of D8 both in lysate and supernatant to that of the precursor form of D8 (Fig. 1C), supporting that newly expressed tPA-D8L in 293T cells was glycosyalated. Interestingly, D8 expressed by vaccinia virus was mainly in its non-glycosylated form based on its apparent molecular weight and resistance to PNGaseF treatment (Fig. 1C). The identity of newly expressed D8 antigen was further confirmed by the strong reactivity between mouse sera immunized with vaccinia virus and the tPA-D8L protein expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1D).",

DNA vaccine construct with the tPA-D8L insert was used in this study because measurements on both antibody response and weight loss indicated that the tPA-D8L DNA vaccine was more effective than the wtD8L DNA vaccine. DNA vaccines expressing individual poxvirus antigens (A27, B5, A33 and L1) were produced similar to previous reports (Hooper et al., 2000, Hooper et al., 2003) except that the gene inserts were subcloned into the pSW3981 vector which is also used for the D8 DNA vaccines as described in this report. By using the same i.p. route challenge model as previously reported, the efficacy of bi-valent formulation with two well studied protective poxvirus antigens (A27 and B5) was significantly improved with the addition of tPA-D8L DNA vaccine as the third component (Fig. 3B). Mice immunized with bi-valent formulation had lost 9.2% of weight on day 3 after challenge, whereas mice immunized with the 3-valent formulation including A27, B5 and D8 had lost only 2.3% (p\n < 0.05). Protection provided by this 3-valent formulation was similar to that provided with the vaccinia virus vaccination. Addition of D8 antigen also improved the protection efficacy of a previously reported 4-valent formulation (A27, B5, L1 and A33) by minimizing the weight loss during the first 1\u20132 days after challenge (Fig. 3C) when studied in the same i.p. challenge model. Mice immunized with the 5-valent formulation that included D8 antigen regained initial body weight at 2.5 days after challenge, as compared to 4.2 days in the 4-valent formulation group that did not include D8 (p\n < 0.05).",

The 3-valent formulation including D8L elicited the strongest neutralizing antibody responses, presumably due to the combination of two strong IMV antigens, A27 and D8.

While a single IMV or EEV antigen was able to provide various levels of protection, the combinations of these antigens in the form of polyvalent formulations afforded better protection in mice against vaccinia virus challenge and in non-human primates against monkeypox challenge (Fogg et al., 2004, Hooper et al., 2000, Hooper et al., 2003, Hooper et al., 2004). The polyvalent vaccine approach is attractive because broader immune responses can be generated by simultaneously targeting several antigens.

Previous version of D8L DNA vaccine was not very immunogenic and not all immunized mice had positive anti-D8 antibody responses (Pulford et al., 2004). In the current study, we used an optimized DNA vaccine vector including an Intron A sequence downstream of the CMV IE promoter which was able to enhance the antigen expression and immunogenicity of DNA vaccines (Wang et al., 2006). Previous D8L DNA vaccine used the entire D8L gene insert but our data suggested that the modified D8L antigen is more immunogenic with the addition of tPA leader and the removal of C-terminal region including TM and cytoplasmic tail to facilitate its secretion. A similar D8L gene design for recombinant protein expression was reported by Hsiao et al. (1999) by removing the C-terminal region and adding a T7 tag to the N-terminus for bacterial expression of D8L antigen. There was no direct comparison between wild type D8 and modified D8 antigens in their study. Utilization of DNA vaccine as a tool made it easier for us to demonstrate that the modified D8L was more effective than the wild type D8L in antigen expression, antibody response and protection against lethal poxvirus challenge.",

            "text": "Our optimized D8L DNA vaccine construct alone was able to provide 100% survival to immunized mice against lethal poxvirus challenge by intraperitoneal route even though mice experienced more weight loss than those that received vaccinia vaccine. Addition of D8 antigen to previously reported 2-(A27 + B5) or 4-valent (A27 + B5 + L1 + A33) formulations further improved protective efficacy as measured by weight loss or survival. In the i.p. challenge model, animals experienced rapid weight loss as a result of receiving large amount of challenge virus. In contrast, the i.n. challenge model used by Fogg et al. for protein-based poxvirus vaccines, mimics the upper respiratory route of transmission of smallpox, requires lower amount of virus than i.p. challenge and takes more days to develop critical weight loss. Our study also showed that mice are more susceptible to i.n. vaccinia challenge than the i.p. challenge, and the lethal dose of virus is significantly reduced with the i.n. route. The i.n. challenged mice demonstrated high morbidity and mortality at a later time post challenge, suggesting a different dynamics of host and pathogen interaction from the i.p. challenge. In our experience, the i.n. challenge represented a more stringent test since the same polyvalent formulations could not provide 100% survival as they did against the i.p. challenge. We used i.p. challenge model in the current study to be consistent with the results reported by Hooper et al. who also used DNA vaccines to deliver subunit poxvirus antigens. We then used the i.n. challenge model to further demonstrate the significant difference between the polyvalent formulations with or without D8 antigen. The polyvalent poxvirus vaccine formulation delivered by DNA immunization effectively induced protection regardless of the model used when compared to the negative controls. Given the many differences between mice and humans, the above results are highly suggestive of the protective potential of polyvalent poxvirus vaccines but their true efficacy will require protection study in non-human primates, and well organized human clinical trials with specified immunogenicity biomarkers which may correlate to protection.",

            "text": "In this study, we also compared the antibody responses against individual recombinant poxvirus antigens, antibody responses against entire vaccinia virus, and neutralizing antibody responses elicited by different DNA vaccine formulations and vaccinia vaccine. It was clear that the levels of antibody responses were partially related to the amount of DNA plasmids used for vaccination. By increasing the valency of the polyvalent formulation in a fixed total dosing regimen, the effective dose of individual components was reduced and the levels of antibody responses against individual antigens were lower. However, the levels of antibody responses against the vaccinia virus were increased with more antigens included in a polyvalent formulation, reflecting an additive effect of antibody responses against multiple antigens. This is similar to vaccinia vaccine which induces very broad antibody responses recognizing many poxvirus antigens but the titers of antibodies against individual poxvirus antigens may be lower than that induced by individual subunit-based vaccines.",

            "text": "In the case of neutralizing antibody responses, our results demonstrated a mixture of the above phenomena. When animals received vaccine formulations of 2\u20133 antigens, addition of another strong IMV antigen (such as D8) increased the levels of neutralizing antibody responses as measured by IMV mediated antibody responses. When more non-IMV antigens were added, the levels of neutralizing antibody responses actually were reduced. Interestingly, the protection was not correlated with the levels of IMV-mediated neutralizing antibody responses. Rather, better protection was achieved with more antigens included in the vaccine formulations, in a way mimicking vaccinia vaccine. At least two other protection mechanisms can be accounted for. First, the polyvalent poxvirus vaccine formulations and vaccinia vaccines also included EEV antigens and thus EEV-mediated neutralizing antibodies may play an important role for part of the protection as reported by previous studies (Appleyard et al., 1971, Boulter and Appleyard, 1973, Fogg et al., 2004, Galmiche et al., 1999, Hooper et al., 2003, Hooper et al., 2004, Law and Smith, 2001). Second, cell-mediated immunity (CMI) may also be critical for protection against smallpox infection (Demkowicz et al., 1996, Ennis et al., 2002, Frey et al., 2002, Kennedy et al., 2004). The finding that the increased IMV neutralizing antibody did not correlate with increased protection will have important impact to the design of subunit-based poxvirus vaccines.",

It was able to induce neutralizing antibodies and protection in both i.p. and i.n. challenge models in mice. Addition of D8 antigen did not interfere with the high immunogenicity of other antigen components in previously reported polyvalent poxvirus vaccine formulations. Our results proved that DNA immunization is a cost effective approach to screen and identify additional protective poxvirus antigens. The ultimate format of subunit-based poxvirus vaccines can be delivered in the form of DNA, protein or a combination of DNA prime plus protein boost which will be benefited from both delivery systems. Most importantly, results presented in this report support further search for optimal groups of protective poxvirus antigens so that polyvalent poxvirus vaccines can be finalized with the best protection efficacy. Since poxviruses are complex viruses, it may be reasonable to study the protection efficacy of additional antigens including those with less well studied protection mechanisms before finally selecting the candidate antigens to be included in subunit-based polyvalent poxvirus vaccine formulations.",

Same amount of transiently expressed antigens (10 ng of protein) were loaded for the SDS\u2013PAGE, then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and blocked overnight at 4 \u00b0C in blocking buffer (0.2% I-block, 0.1% Tween-20 in 1X PBS). Membranes were incubated with 1:200 dilution of rabbit sera immunized with corresponding DNA vaccines. After being washed, blots were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Tropix, Bedford, MA) at 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, and signals were detected using a chemiluminescence Western-Light Kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). For the glycosylation study, peptide N-Glycosidase F, PNGaseF (New England BioLab, Beverly, MA) was added to the denatured samples prepared from the supernatants of transiently transfected 293T cells according to manufacturer's instruction. After incubating overnight at 37 \u00b0C, samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot as described above.",

Confluent Vero cells monolayers were infected with antibody-virus mixtures for 1 h, washed with PBS and incubated under liquid overlay for 2 days. Monolayers were then stained with 0.5% of crystal violet for 5 min and plaques were counted.
