Gene therapy is a therapeutic approach in which therapeutic nucleic acids are transferred into the affected organs. Although the ideal concept would be the replacement of the abnormal gene by a copy of the functional gene, currently there have not been reliable and safe techniques to allow the site-specific integration of DNA into the human genome (2). Thus, almost all gene therapies are developed by simply transferring the therapeutic gene into somatic cells without replacing the abnormal gene. The goal is to identify and correct genetic abnormalities interfering with the cell cycle and to correct them in all cells. Technically, there are two methods amenable for gene transfer: reintroduction of in vitro transferred gene into the body and direct transfer of gene into the target cells in vivo.",

Genes involved in carcinogenesis are often usefully categorized as either oncogenes contributing to the development of cancer or tumor suppressor genes suppressing the development and maintenance of the cancer phenotype. Therefore, gene therapy is developed by targeting these two genes. Current strategies undergoing development for gene therapy involve in restoring tumor suppressor gene function, downregulating oncogeneic expression, stimulating immune response, introducing genes that either increase drug sensitivity or confer multidrug resistance, and modulating tumor angiogenesis genetically (4\u201313). In this chapter, principles and methods of suicide gene therapy are reviewed together with the results of its clinical trials. Protocols required for application of human study are discussed in details by using Ad-TK gene therapy for liver tumors as an example.",

These drugs are phosphorylated to the active form by the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded for part of the HSV genome. The HSV-TK gene is expressed after herpetic viral TK transcription, leading to activation of the drug and cell death. To achieve expression of HSV-TK, which is specific only to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, an AFP promoter has been constructed. The promoter ensures that only cells expressing AFP are able to transcribe and express the HSV-TK gene.",

Under the control of an AFP promoter, an adenoviral vector was used to bring the HSV-TK gene into various HCC cell lines (5). Following ganciclovir (GCV) administration, cell death occurred in hepatoma cells producing AFP, leaving non-AFP-producing cell lines unaffected. Phosphorylated GCV is thought to cause cell death by the inhibition of DNA polymerase and by causing chain termination during DNA synthesis in dividing cells, which then leads to apoptosis (16). A bystander effect has been described, both in vitro and in vivo, where neighboring HSV-TK-negative cells have died when in contact with HSV-TK-positive cells after GCV treatment (17). This increases the effectiveness of suicide gene therapy, and only a part of a tumor mass needs to be transfected by a suicide gene for tumor destruction. A glucocorticoid-responsive element exists upstream of the AFP gene in hepatoma cells, which explains the increase in AFP observed after the addition of dexamethasone into the culture medium of such cells (18). It is possible that the potency of the TK/GCV suicide system could be enhanced by the addition of dexamethasone to a HepG2 cell line (19).",

The retrovirus has been further improved so that the HSV-TK gene expression is under the control of a human AFP enhancer directly linked to its promoter [LNAF0.3(E+)TK]. The vector also sensitized both low- and intermediate-AFP-producing hepatoma cells to GCV treatment, and did not affect cell growth in nonhepatoma cells (20). In animal models, GCV treatment has led to more pronounced growth inhibition in the LNAF0.3(E+)TK infected cells than in the LNAF0.3TK infected cells (20).

Tumor selectivity was confirmed by the regression of HuH-7 established tumors in athymic mice, whereas normal tissues remained unaffected (7). The bystander effect enabled tumor regression even when only 10% of the tumor mass expressed HSV-TK (17). A similar therapeutic response has been seen in rats with colorectal liver metastases, where following direct intratumoral injections of HSV-TK-producing packaging cells, a 60-fold reduction in tumor mass was noted following GCV treatment when compared with controls (21). Kuriyama et al. described cancer gene therapy with the GCV-HSV-TK system that induced efficient antitumor effects and protective immunity in immunocompetent mice, but not in nude mice. This indicates that a T-cell-mediated immune response may be a critical factor for HSV-TK gene therapy to be successful (22).",

Injection of Ad.CMV-CD into the tail vein of tumor-bearing mice resulted in delayed tumor growth with a significant reduction in hepatic metastases. Gnant et al.

The response rate was assessed by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria with follow-up imaging studies. The assessment of toxicity was carried out according to Common Toxicity Criteria v. 2.0 from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). One patient was withdrawn from the study because of clinical deterioration from disease and died. Stable disease (defined as <25% change in the size of the tumor measured on computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) was seen in 11 patients. One patient had a biopsy of the injected tumor at 11 wk following treatment that revealed extensive necrosis of the tumor on histology, whereas five others had a biopsy taken at the later date but showed no evidence of necrosis. Adv.RSV-TK DNA was not detected in any of these six biopsed specimen. Low transient toxicities were present in patients including grade 1 elevations in serum aminotransferase in three patients, grade 2\u20133 fevers in five patients, grade 3 thrombocytopenia in one patient, and grade 2 leucopenia in three patients. One patient is alive at 40.5 mo, but the remaining 15 died between 0.2 and 36.5 mo (median: 11.3 mo). The authors concluded that adv.RSV-TK could be safely administered by percutaneous intratumoral injection in patients with hepatic metastases at doses up to 1.0\u00d71013 virus particles per patient and could provide the basis for future clinical trials. However, the trial did not demonstrate any tumor reponse following intratumoural injection of adv.RSV-TK.",

There are a number of approvals that are required for a proposed human clinical gene therapy trial to be approved and allow patient accrual. In the United Kingdom, the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee (GTAC) together with the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) are established to evaluate proposals for human gene therapy. The creation of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) has standardized approaches across European countires. In the United States, guidelines have been drawn up by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) of the National Institutes of Health to facilitate documentation, review, and discussion on human gene therapy.

After viral internalization, intracellular adenoviral replication augments an administered dose to the level required to kill the tumor host cells only, leaving neighboring normal tissues intact. dl1520 is an adenovirus hybrid of serotypes 2 and 5 with a genome deletion in the E1B region, causing loss of expression of viral 55-kDa protein (E1B 55K). E1B 55K has been shown to bind to the mammalian tumor cell suppressor protein p53 and block p53-mediated transcriptional activation (32). p53 has many functions including arrest of the G1 phase of cell proliferation via the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF1/Cip1, or apoptosis through induction of genes such as bax (33).

Habib et al. (11) have reported the results of a phase I and a phase II clinical study, in which patients with primary and secondary liver tumors were treated with E1B 55-kDa deleted dl1520. The adenovirus was given via three different routes: intratumoral, intra-arterial, and intravenous. The study has confirmed that dl1520 was well tolerated when given as either monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore, ultrastructural examination of tissue showed the presence of adenovirus in cell cytoplasm around the nucleus and revealed two dissimilar end points of cell death after virus infection: a preapoptotic sequence and necrosis (11). Reid et al. have recently published their results of a phase I study in patients with colorectal liver metastases by using intra-arterial administration of a replication-selective adenovirus (dl1520) (38). In this study, dl1520 was infused into the hepatic artery at doses of 2\u00d7108 to 2\u00d71012 particles for two cycles (d 1 and 8) with subsequent cycles of dl1520 administered in combination with intravenous 5-FU and leucovorin. They have successfully demonstrated intravascular administration of dl1520 virus and have shown that hepatic artery infusion of the attenuated adenovirus dl1520 was well tolerated at doses resulting in infection, replication, and chemotherapy-associated antitumoral activity.",
