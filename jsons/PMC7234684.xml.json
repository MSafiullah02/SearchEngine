Shortly thereafter, visitation restrictions and guidance to reduce contact with older adults (OA), \u2265 age 65, were put in place at many facilities caring for OAs with the aim to protect them from infection.1\u20133 According to the World Health Organization, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 in older adults in China 80 years and older was 21.9% compared to 1.4% for people of all ages with no underlying health conditions.4 However, as many state and civic leaders are now debating lockdowns many OAs may lack the assistance they need at home or in facilities to meet their daily needs. Self-imposed and/or institution-imposed social distancing could make OAs feel isolated, anxious, and sorrowful over their loss of independence and connections to friends and family.",

Apps were further screened based on function and then ranking. Users\u2019 experiences of the app were given consideration during the selection; hence, recent customer reviews that demonstrated that the app was a valuable product for an OA were selected and summarized as anecdotes. We conducted a literature review using PubMed and Google Scholar on the topic, but as many apps are not rigorously tested for usability and efficacy in the OA population, this selection was mainly based on expert review.",
