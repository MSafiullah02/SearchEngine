Our guidelines are aligned with the joint statement previously published in AAGL with several societies (5): elective surgeries should be postponed or rescheduled, and this should be a joint decision between surgeon and patient; risk factors for COVID-19 should be checked with patient, and the absence of COVID-19 symptoms should exhaustively be confirmed in case she needs a surgery to undergo. Testing should be massively encouraged prior to surgery. Within the operating room, N-95 masks should be guaranteed for the surgical team (as well as the rest of accessoriesshoe covers, gown, protective head covering, gloves and eye protection), number of personnel should be restricted inside the operating room (OR), and prior conversation with the anesthesia team should be done prior to each procedure. For vaginal and abdominal surgeries, use of N-95 masks plus face shields should be present and smoke dispersion should be avoided as much as possible.",
