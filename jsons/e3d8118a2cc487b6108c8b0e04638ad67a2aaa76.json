Today, isolation policy is enforced by identifying infected individuals based on symptoms when these appear or by testing people and quarantining those who have been in close contact with infected people. In addition, many countries have imposed complete or partial lock-downs to control the spread of the disease. While this has resulted in some some success in slowing down the spread of the virus, lock-downs as well as widespread quarantine have devastating effects on the economy and social life. Thus, governments are urgently looking for efficient strategies to significantly relax lock-downs, while still controlling the spread of the virus. We argue that this can be done by using active feedback to control testing for infection by actively testing individuals with a high probability of being infected. We develop an active testing strategy to achieve this goal, and demonstrate that it would have tremendous success in controlling the spread of the virus on one million people, using 3, 000 tests per day. Our results show up to a 50% reduction in quarantine rate and morbidity rate in typical settings as compared to existing methods.",

            "text": "1 Since imposing significant (or even complete) quarantine can have devastating economic consequences, early detection of Corona positives is of paramount importance to suppress the spread of COVID-19 as early as possible. Hence, the second component in fighting the pandemic is to devise and manufacture COVID-19 tests. Today, health systems around the world prioritize the administration of tests to people who have had direct contact with an infected person or who are symptomatic. Some countries, such as South Korea, are implementing extensive resources to test people widely and randomly to detect areas where the pandemic is likely to spread. Nevertheless, these strategies do not exploit resources effectively. First, only testing symptomatic people results in a loss of precious time, during which the individual can infect others before symptoms appear. Furthermore, many people (about 10% \u2212 30%) are asymptomatic, and thus cannot be identified using this strategy. In addition, testing the entire population on a daily basis to detect people who remain asymptomatic is impossible because the number of tests that labs can either produce or process is limited. Clearly, quarantining the entire population for a long period of time has devastating effects on economy and social life. For these reasons, we address the imperative question of whether a strategy to test and isolate a relatively small number of people while effectively suppressing the spread of COVID-19 can be developed. Specifically, the main challenge is how to efficiently test and isolate people in the population to significantly reduce the negative impacts of the spread of the virus, in terms of the burden on the health system (i.e., flattening the curve of infected people per day), total morbidity (i.e., reducing the total number of severe COVID-19 patients), and the economic and social impact (i.e., reducing the total number of people required to stay in quarantine and the time people spend in quarantine). In this paper, we address this challenge, and develop active testing and isolation (ATI) strategy that achieves this goal.",

Recently, partial lock-down strategies have been suggested, in which half of the population remains under lock-down, where the other half is released, in alternation (24) , or by applying a cyclic schedule of 4 days of work and 10 days of lock-down (19) . However, these strategies lead to more than a 50% loss in economic productivity, which we aim to avoid. These strategies are based on the effectiveness of quarantine, and are simple to analyze. However, they do not consider wide-scale testing, which is available. By tracing and quarantining only those at risk (e.g., those in close contact with an infected individual, depending on the duration of contact and distance), epidemics can be contained without using aggressive lock-downs (7, 11) , using surveillance and containment measures for patients (26), contact tracing (8, 10) and mathematical modelling of the transmission dynamics of the infection (22) .",

            "text": "As reported recently in (29) , increasing the COVID-19 test rate per population would have a significant positive impact on mitigating the pandemic around the world. The missing component in most existing methods is that they do not use COVID-19 tests to identify infected people in development and analysis of strategies to suppress the pandemic. However, there are a number of recent studies that incorporate tests to mitigating the spread (29) , and provide worst-case analysis of a risk-based selective quarantine (33) . Nevertheless, these methods use passive testing in the sense that post-processing the test results is not used to improve the future sampling process of the tested population (i.e., openloop). In a recently published Science paper (7), Ferretti et al. concluded that viral spread could be controlled using contact-tracing by testing close contacts of positive cases. In this paper, we argue that suppressing viral spread can be accomplished much more efficiently by developing a controlled sensing methodology for contact-tracing, rather than testing close contacts in a deterministic manner as in (7) . Controlled sensing, a.k.a active sensing, is based on classic sequential experimental design theory (3, 30) , and has attracted growing attention in recent years in various hypothesis testing and dynamic search problems (4, 14, 17, 18, 20, 25, 27, 34, 38) . Controlled sensing policies, where the location of the sensing is judiciously selected, have also been used to identify influence in social networks (36) , as well as to learn the dynamics in general networks such as gene networks and social networks to reduce the overall number of required experiments (35) . The basic idea behind controlled sensing theory when translated to the realm of detecting COVID-19 patients is that the learner (i.e., the testing system) can use the results obtained from previous tests to adjust its monitoring strategy in a closed-loop manner and improve its future testing and learning process. Intuitively, as more tests are performed, the learner becomes more certain about the true state of the population, which in turn leads to better choices of people to test. This approach was shown to achieve the asymptotic information theoretic bound in various hypothesis testing and dynamic search problems as the error probability approaches zero (see e.g., (15, 25, 27, 28) and our previous work (4, 5, 12, 17) ). Here, we develop a controlled testing methodology to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. We report a significant reduction (up to 50%) in both quarantine rate as well as morbidity rate in typical settings of COVID-19 parameters as compared to existing studies.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique using a stochastic spread model in populations of 100, 000 and 1 million people. We show that we can reduce the quarantine period (defined as the period where more than 1% of the population is quarantined) by up to 50%, while reducing the peak of number of infected people per day, as well as the total morbidity by a significant amount. Our methodology allows optimal exploitation of the testing capacity, and the method can be implemented under testing capacity limitation.

(7) . In this technique, when an infected agent is detected, all its close contacts are quarantined and are told to get tested. While DTI is much more efficient than the previous two methods, it allocates efforts to people unlikely to be infected, either because of the duration of contact or other prior information collected by the contact tracing. It also incurs a delay in testing second order infections. We propose two levels of active testing: Computing infection probabilities based solely on first order contacts or by solely using second order contacts, dubbed 1st-order, and 2nd-order ATI, respectively. The latter becomes more efficient when the testing capacity is large.",

As shown, as long as the tests are properly controlled by the ATI, the decay time is relatively short with a significantly lower quarantine rate even when the quarantine is only observed by 70% percent of the population required to be in quarantine. In contrast, with such a low number of tests, the RTI is practically equivalent to the NTI. The combination of a low quarantine rate and random testing is incapable of providing an effective means to block the spread, although it does manage to flatten the curve over a very long period. DTI has better performance, and the active approach is significantly superior in controlling future small outbreaks (DTI requires twice quarantine days, and results in twice morbidity rate, and higher load on health system as compared to ATI). Thus, accurate contact tracing with controlled testing does not require a huge amount of testing to stop the outbreak. We observed (see supplementary material for detailed numbers) that NTI achieves results that are between tens and up to hundreds of percent worse than ATI when the quarantine success rate is between 100% and 70%, respectively. Tables 1, 2 present the total infected population, overall quarantine days over the epidemic and the peak infection for all methods for quarantine success rates of 70%, 80%, respectively. It can be seen that the total days lost due to quarantine by NTI are 4 times and up to 8 times greater than ATI, and even DTI requires 40% and up to 100% more quarantine days than ATI, mainly because it does not order people to be tested according to the probability of infection. NTI and RTI also result in 4 times and up to 9 times more infected individuals.",

Steps 1, 2 identify infected people based on symptoms or test results. Then, people who are declared infected and their first-order neighbors are quarantined. The outcome of these steps is used to update the beliefs of all people in the population graph, which is then used to sample and test the most likely infected people regardless of their symptomatic state. This is the crucial concept that enables ATI to identify infected people early before symptoms appear, and decreases viral reproduction.",

We used a microscopic stochastic model which includes every agent in the population as described below. We model the connections between all N people in an area (e.g., state, district, city) as an undirected graph, where the people are represented by a set N = {a 1 , a 2 , ..., a N } of agents (or nodes or vertices), and \"close contacts\" between people who might cause infection are represented by a set E of edges 1 . The existence of an edge (n, i) \u2208 E between persons n, and i is determined based on criteria for potential infections. For example, being within 2 meters of a COVID-19 patient for more than 15 minutes is defined as close contact by the Israeli Ministry of Health, which can be represented by an edge in our population graph model. By using more accurate distance determination provided by short range wireless communication such as Bluetooth we might be able to define or learn a probability distribution from the data for the probability of infection. This turns the graph into a weighted graph, with time varying weights.",

As shown for an advanced stage epidemic with 0.1% of the population already infected, the quarantine of large portions of the population (e.g., > 2%) can be reduced by over two months compared to random testing and by almost two weeks compared to simple neighbor testing, when up to 0.3% of the population is being tested every day. Similarly, the peak load on the health system can be reduced by 18% compared to testing randomly and by 10% compared to contact tracing with no controlled testing.

We simulated different values of quarantine efficiency, in which the quarantine was only adhered to 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% percent of the people required to be in quarantine, respectively. As a baseline to our suggested ATI method (first and second order), we simulated the NTI, RTI, and DTI methods, as described in the Performance Evaluation section. The results are presented in Tables 3, 4 , and 5. Table 3 shows that the total infected people by NTI is between 1.6 and 9 times higher than ATI. Even using DTI results suffers from up to twice the morbidity as compared to ATI for a 70% quarantine success rate. It can be seen in Table 4 the peak number of infected people in NTI is up to 1.6 times higher than ATI. Even using DTI results suffers from up to 1.17 times the peak number of infected people as compared to ATI for a 70% quarantine success rate. Finally, in addition to the effectiveness of ATI in terms of reducing the burden on the health system, and reducing the total morbidity, Table 5 shows that ATI achieves these goals at a relatively small cost in terms of required qurantine days. Specifically, the total days lost for quarantine by NTI are between 1.6 and 8 times more than ATI, and even DTI requires between 1.17 and 2 times more quarantine days than ATI.",

Then, the probability that person a j is infected through infection paths P 1 (a j ) or P 2 (a j ) only is given by:By assuming that p n,i << 1 for all n, i, we get:We use this approximation to update the beliefs over the population graph in the simulated models described next.Using simulated models to validate policy Description of the graph topology: We simulated a COVID-19 outbreak environment with N people. The outbreak is initiated by N I infected people. In the simulations we set N = 100, 000, and N I = 50, or N = 1, 000, 000, and N I = 1, 000. The degree distribution of the population graph captures different volume levels to model different types of social connections in the graph. For example, an office worker might have 25 close contacts, while a public service worker might have 200 close contacts. An example of the tail probability of the degrees in the population graph that we used in the simulations is illustrated in Fig. 5 .Simulating symptomatic and asymptomatic people: An infected person can be asymptomatic or symptomatic. In the simulations we set 30% of people as asymptomatic. For asymptomatic people, symptoms do not appear and the only way to verify their condition is by testing them. For symptomatic people, we model the appearance time of symptoms by a Rayleigh distributed random variable with parameter 5.1/ 2 log(2), as illustrated in Fig. 6 . This distribution models the appearance of symptoms",
