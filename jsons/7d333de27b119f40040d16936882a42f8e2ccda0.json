Fiveadaptive modesare described: I) fire-resistant species that are large, thick-barked, and have large cones and long needles; 2) tall, fast-growing mesophytic species with moderately high shade tolerance; 3) stress-tolerant species with animal-dispersed seeds, occurring mainly on coldor dry siteswhere fire is infrequent; 4) fire-resilient species that areprecocious reproducers withsmall seeds, oftenin serotinous cones; and 5) species ofsouthern mesic siteswithfastgrowth, strong, heavy woodand shortpersistence of needles. Intermediates between these modesexist. Convergent evolution has occasionally occurred, as shown by high ecological similarity of species in different taxonomic sections within Pinus. However, the analogies between species are imperfect, suggesting the importance of constraint by shared ancestry and divergence produced by a diversity of environments.",

The genus is sometimes considered to have a narrow set of roles (e.g., Govindaraju, 1984) in the ecosystem: droughttolerant pioneers on nutritionally poor sites. Yet the variation among species in morphology and life history is rich. Furthermore, there appears to be a striking recurrence ofecologically similar sets of species in different geographic areas-species analogs. For example, there are a number of seemingly analogous species between the northern Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes states: Pinus contorta and P. banksiana, P. monticola and P. strobus, and P. ponderosa and P. resinosa (nomenclature follows Little and Critchfield, 1969) . Are these and other potential species analogs supported by quantitative analyses oftheir similarities? Are there adaptive modes or syndromes, recurring suites of ecological traits?",

All North American species north of Mexico were included except for three species with insufficient data (Pinus engelmannii = P. apacheca; P. washoensis; P. strobiformis is included here under P. jlexilis). Recent segregates in the P. cembroides complex (P. discolor Bailey and Hawksworth, P. johannis M. F. Robert, P. remota (Little) Bailey and Hawksworth) are included under P. cembroides. The Great Basin bristlecone pine (P. longaeva) is part of P. aristata as used here. The Rocky Mountain subspecies latifolia ofP. contorta was kept separate from subspecies contorta because of their different habitats (Critchfield, 1957; Fowells, 1965; P. contorta ssp. murrayana is included under P. c. ssp. contorta). P. rigida and P. serotina were also kept separate for this reason (Smouse and Saylor, 1973) . Thirty-four taxa (henceforth \"species\") were thus included.",

Therefore, certain characters 353 [Vol. 75 were excluded from the analysis that are traditionally important taxonomic characters but have questionable ecological significance. Number of needles per fascicle is the most important of these excluded characters: it occupies a central position in distinguishing the subdivisions of Pinus (Little and Critchfield, 1969) . To the extent that ecological groups parallel taxonomic groups, spurious correlations between ecological factors and conservative taxonomic characters will be found. Yeaton (1981) postulated adaptive significance to needle number based on an observed correlation between site moisture and needle num-. ber in the Sierra Nevada. It is presumed here, however, that needle number is generally a conservative character (exception: needle number in the pinyon pines) reflecting shared ancestry rather than strong, direct selection. The data set's ecological emphasis also derives from inclusion of characters that would probably be poor characters in a taxonomic study: for example, growth rate, sprouting ability, shade tolerance, and soil moisture of a species' usual habitat.",

Many ofthe species are fireresistant (P. lambertiana, Fowells, 1965; P. palustris, Wahlenberg, 1946; P. ponderosa, Flint, 1930) . Thick bark confers fire resistance in these species by insulating the cambium (Fahnestock and Hare, 1964; Wright and Bailey, 1982, 18) . Also, thick twigs should have higher heat capacities than thin twigs, resulting in lower cambial temperatures during groundsurface fires. (They may also be the structural by-products of tufts of long needles on the branch ends.) Effective seed insulation is provided by thick cone scales in some pines (Linhart, 1978) , but the literature lacked sufficient data to include that character in this study. The tufts of long needles at the end of the branches may insulate terminal buds, not only from fire but also from other microclimatic fluctuations.

This species also has perhaps the most strongly developed characteristics for fire tolerance: besides extremely long needles, it has a persistentjuvenile \"grass stage\" (a tuft ofneedles surrounding a short shoot) followed by a stage of rapid shoot elongation (Wahlenberg, 1946) . In this fire-resistant stage the tree develops its root system and stores resources to allow fast height growth.

The ability to resprout is generally restricted to seedlings and saplings (Stone and Stone, 1954) . This may provide a mechanism for improved survival offire-susceptible species on sites subject to fire-free intervals shorter than required for plentiful seed reproduction. attenuata-Pinus attenuata and P. radiata have larger cones and more massive cone scales than is typical for Group 4. However, as compared to P. radiata, P. attenuata is shorter, has more persistent leaves, thinner bark, sharper cone armor, and lower shade tolerance. These Group 3 characteristics suggest more stressful environments than those of P. radiata and perhaps less frequent fire in its dry, rocky habitats. This mainly inland species differs from its coastal relatives, P. radiata and P. muricata, in its tendency to grow in \"dry, submarginal forest sites\" (Critchfield, 1967) . Of the serotinous pines, P. attenuata is apparently most consistent in this character (Vogl, 1973; McMaster and Zedler, 1981) . banksiana-Closely related to P. contorta and P. contorta ssp. latifolia, this species has the lightest seeds of the North American pines. Light seeds with a substantial seed wing gives these species good potential for wind dispersal. Pinus banksiana differs from most species in Group 4 in having cones that are virtually unarmed. Although P. banksiana readily hybridizes with P. contorta (Duffield, 1952; Critchfield, 1967) , the two have had distinct ecological histories for the tens of thousands of years since their probable divergence in the Pleistocene (Critchfield, 1985) , and have several ecological differences (see under P. contorta ssp. latifolia). clausa-Pinus clausa lies close to the central tendency of Group 4. In contrast to other pines of the extreme Southeast, P. clausa grows well on xeric, deep-sand sites (Brendemuehl, 1981) . contorta ssp. contorta-Similar to P. banksiana and P. contorta ssp. latifolia, P. c. ssp. contorta has small seeds. It differs from ssp. latifolia, however, it its short stature, short and more persistent leaves, generally nonserotinous cones, and its tendency toward wetter habitats (occurring in coastal sphagnum bogs, sand dunes, and barrens as well as moist sites at high elevations along the Sierra Nevada-Cascade axis [Critchfield, 1957] ). contorta ssp. latifolia-: This taxon is ecologically similar to P. contorta ssp. contorta and P. banksiana. Differences from P.c. ssp. contorta are given under that taxon. The ssp. latifolia differs from P. banksiana in its greater height, longer needles, longer leaf persistence, and sharp spines on the cone scales.",

Cone armor would appear to provide defense against such cone predators as birds and squirrels. Although cone predation by birds results in effective seed dispersal in some pines (see under Group 3 above), predation by squirrels is considered less effective in disseminating seeds to sites favorable for germination (Tomback, 1982; Hutchins and Lanner, 1982; Benkman, Balda, and Smith, 1984) . A variety ofdefenses against cone predation by squirrels has been proposed, including asymmetric cone structure and attachment, thick cone scales, cone scales armed with sharp spines, and cone serotiny (Smith, 1970; Elliott, 1974; Linhart, 1978) . Of these characters, only cone serotiny and arming ofcone scales are included in this study. While cone serotiny affords some defense against predation, its role in the fire ecology of pines confounds its interpretation as a defense against predators. Cone armor appears to be more clearly related to predation alone; indeed, it showed little consistent pattern in relationship to the other characters. However, the distribution of cone armor among the pines is puzzling. The lack of spines on cones of largeseeded species that rely on bird dispersal makes ecological sense, but what ofthe seemingly defenseless species such as P. banksiana, P. glabra, and P. monticola, that have small seeds with substantial wings and, in some cases, share habitats with pines having heavily armed cones? Do these species avoid seed predation in some other way or is cone armor a largely ineffective deterrent to predation?",
