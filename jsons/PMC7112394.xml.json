            "text": "Dengue is currently considered as one of the most important mosquito-borne diseases worldwide. According to recent estimates, the global incidence of dengue infections has increased from 50 to 100 million to almost 400 million cases per year [1]. Despite the enormous efforts towards the development of dengue vaccine, there is still no licensed vaccine available. This is primarily due to the complex pathology of the disease and immune mediated responses against the four distinct serotypes [2]. Presently, many promising vaccine candidates are in pre-clinical and clinical development stages including live attenuated, inactivated, recombinant subunit, DNA, and viral vectored vaccines [3]. The development of therapies for DENV requires both an understanding of the viral life cycle and rational strategies for identifying antiviral inhibitors. Both viral and host proteins essential for viral replication cycle are potential targets for antiviral drug development [4].",

            "text": "Dengue related infections are caused by the dengue viruses, which belongs to the family Flaviviridae and include small enveloped viruses with a diameter of about 50 nm [5]. Dengue virus contains an 11 kb positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. The genome consists of a single open reading frame which encodes three structural proteins (capsid C, pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E) protein), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [6]. The structural proteins form the viral particle and the non-structural proteins participate in the replication of the RNA genome, virion assembly and invasion of innate immune response [7]. NS5, with a molecular weight of around 104 kDa is the largest of dengue virus proteins containing 900 amino acids. NS5 is the most conserved protein of the dengue proteome as it shares a minimum of 67% amino acid sequence across all four dengue serotypes [8], [9]. NS5 is essential for RNA replication and performs enzymatic activities required for capping and synthesis of RNA genome of virus. It consists of two domains with distinct functions, the N-terminal methyl transferase (MTase) and the C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalytic domain [9], [10]. The tertiary structure of RdRp consists of palm, thumb and finger subdomains. The catalytic site contains conserved aspartic residues and coordinated magnesium cations and nucleotide incorporation occurs through two metal ion catalytic mechanism [9].",

The replication of flaviviral RNA occurs through the formation of replicative intermediates synthesized by the RdRp, an essential component of a replication complex [12]. Recombinant NS5 full-length protein along with C-terminal domain alone have been shown to possess RdRp activity in-vitro, which was also evaluated in a study with NS5 protein of DENV-1 expressed in E. coli as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion. The in vitro demonstration of polymerase activity in recombinant NS5 protein has made it possible to study and identify the host and virus factors involved in the dengue virus genome replication [13], [14]. Flavivirus RdRp initiates the RNA synthesis via de novo initiation mechanism in which first nucleotide serves as a primer to provide the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group which differs from a primer (an oligonucleotide, a protein linked to nucleotides, or intra-molecular self-priming) dependent mechanism used by other viruses, such as poliovirus and SARS-CoV [15], [16].",

            "text": "Owing to the central role of polymerase enzymes in viral life cycles, RdRps have been the target of considerable interest for antiviral drug development [17]. RdRp is an unstable protein and is prone to inactivation upon prolonged incubation at room temperature (RT) thereby affecting the inhibitor screening assays. It has been observed that addition of linker residues to the N-terminal end of the RdRp domain stabilizes the protein and enhances its de novo polymerase initiation activity and thermostability [18]. Mutation studies of the linker residues have indicated their importance for viral replication, consequently, accelerating the development of antivirals against dengue. The 74 kDa RdRp domain of DENV-2 has been expressed in E. coli and purified with a high quantity of the protein. It was observed that the protein was active with considerably similar enzymatic characteristics as its full-length counterpart [13]. Previous studies with NS5 RdRp of DENV-3 have described high quantity production of the protein with >95% purity, yielding 3 mg protein from 1 L of culture [9]. In the current study, expression and purification of the RdRp domain of DENV-2 NS5 protein from E. coli was carried out and the polymerase activity of the recombinant protein was successfully demonstrated using an in vitro transcribed RNA. Based on its multifunctional role in viral replication, NS5 has been identified as an interesting drug target for the development of therapies against dengue. The aim of this investigation was to demonstrate the in vitro polymerase activity of the purified recombinant RdRp (NS5) protein. This assay will provide a platform for screening and development of antiviral compounds specifically targeting the polymerase protein.",

Large scale (1 L) culture was then grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C until OD600 of 0.7\u20130.8 was reached. Induction was done at 18 \u00b0C for 20 h using 0.4 mM IPTG. Induced culture was centrifuged at 6000g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C to pellet down the cells containing the expressed protein. Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer containing lysozyme and sonicated at 60% amplitude and centrifuged again to pellet down the lysed cells. The supernatant containing the expressed protein was collected for further purification.",

We successfully expressed RdRp domain of NS5 protein in high expression strain of E. coli using cloned DNA fragments of dengue-2 virus [21]. It was observed that utilizing BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells for expression increased the overall yield of the protein. The protein was purified to homogeneity by successive chromatographic techniques, immobilized metal affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The two-step purification procedures helped get rid of the degradation product continuously obtained during initial expression and purification steps. Similar degradation products of \u223c35 kDa size have also been reported during studies with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and were later identified to be cleavage products of NS5 [22]. It was also observed that RdRp was very sensitive to temperature and a very short exposure to increased temperature lead to a decline in the polymerase activity. Previous studies regarding induced mutation within NS5 RdRp have shown improved thermostability of the protein [18]. It is essential to further optimize the screening procedure and efforts are being made in order to obtain a thermostable protein. In this study, a decline in the activity was observed when protein was incubated for longer than 60 min during in vitro RdRp assay. The reduction in the activity suggests that the reaction was completed within 60 min of incubation and the protein starts to degrade at longer time points. Therefore, all the subsequent optimization reactions were incubated for 60 min.",

These results indicated that the RdRp domain of DENV-2 NS5 protein alone was able to synthesize RNA de novo using homopolymeric poly(rC) RNA template without the help of other viral/cellular proteins, as previously indicated by studies with other flaviviruses such as DENV-1, Kunjin virus and Japanese encephalitis virus [14], [23], [22]. Previous studies have also reported polymerase activity of recombinant NS5 (RdRp) protein in the presence of poly(rC) RNA template [24], [13]. Therefore, optimization studies were carried out in the presence of poly(rC) RNA template in primer-independent setup. Literature suggests that DENV NS5 has the ability to initiate RNA synthesis in the presence of high concentrations of GTP which is the second nucleotide to be incorporated during negative sense RNA synthesis [25]. Structural studies with Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) polymerase indicated the existence of GTP binding site in the polymerase and during de novo initiation GTP binds to the site serving as a primer by providing the 3\u2032-OH for the formation of first phosphodiester bond [26]. These studies also indicated the importance of the use of poly(rC) RNA template during the in vitro polymerase assays. The DENV-2 RdRp protein purified during the course of this study showed optimal polymerase activity in the presence of 1 \u03bcM protein, 5 \u03bcM GTP, divalent cations \u2212Mn2+ and Mg2+, and incubation time of 1 h at 30 \u00b0C.",

Recent studies on enzymatic activities of NS5, coupled with structure\u2013function and interaction studies reveal the multifunctional role of the protein in viral replication [17]. The high-level production and purification of recombinant versions of either the full-length NS5 or the two individual NS5 domains has also led to detail enzymatic studies on NS5 and the determination of structures of the two NS5 domains [10]. Research on flaviviruses has led to the characterization of an increasing number of virus-encoded proteins and enzymes, including envelope and capsid proteins, polymerases, helicases and proteases. Chemical libraries containing molecules of natural and synthetic origins can now be screened against these novel pathways and targets. This study provides an optimized method for the production of an active DENV RdRp (NS5) protein which will further help establish high-throughput compound screening assays directed against NS5. In future, mutation studies of NS5 protein can prove to be helpful in enhancing thermostability and de novo RNA polymerization activities of the protein.",
