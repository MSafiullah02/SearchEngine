Airflow limitation in COPD is caused by an abnormal chronic inflammatory response to noxious particles or gases and subsequent airway remodeling (Figure PP10-1\n). The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke, but the burning of biomass fuels is also considered to be a risk factor. A key feature of COPD is the occurrence of acute exacerbations (AECOPD), defined as a sudden worsening of symptoms beyond the usual day-to-day variation. Exacerbations of COPD are associated with reduced quality of life and accelerated decline in lung function and represent a substantial socioeconomic burden. Therefore, prevention and adequate management of exacerbations should be an integral part of the comprehensive care of COPD patients.",

More evidence is required, however, before biomarker selection can be implemented.",
