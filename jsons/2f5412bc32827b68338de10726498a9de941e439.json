We hypothesize that tracheostomy has an independent negative impact on language and cognitive development in infants with severe BPD. Study design This is a retrospective cohort study of de-identified data of infants with severe BPD who received tracheostomy at <2 years of age, compared with infants with severe BPD without tracheostomy. The primary outcomes measured were total language and cognitive scores at 2-3 years of age as determined by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition. Results A total of 26 patients with tracheostomies and 28 patients without tracheostomies were analyzed. There was no significant difference in total language development or cognitive development between patients with tracheostomies and those without. Insurance status had an effect on language and cognition while controlling for trach status. Conclusions Tracheostomy does not independently impact the language and cognitive development of infants with severe BPD.",

(Fig. 1 ) Twenty-six patients with tracheostomies and twenty-eight patients without tracheostomies were identified. The results of The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition were analyzed for Language and Cognitive development. Demographics were similar between the two cohorts, tracheostomy vs no tracheostomy, with a statistically significant differences in the following: racial distribution, respiratory support at 36 weeks PMA, presence of tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) diagnosed by bronchoscopy, length of hospital stay, and age at hospital discharge. (Table 1) For each patient cohort, we analyzed the reported range for both total language development and cognitive development. The motor scale scores of development was also reported although this was not part of the primary outcome of interest. We used the numerical composite scores for each of the main scales of development. Each composite score was then used to determine the equivalent qualitative range of impairment such as profound, severe, moderate, borderline, etc., by using the standard psychometric conversion table. There was no significant difference in language composite score between patients with tracheostomies and those without (trachs mean = 75.19 (SD = 17.30), or median 74 (IQR 59,86) and nontrachs mean = 77.18 (SD = 14.08), or median 79 (IQR 71, 86); p value = 0.645). (Table 2 and Fig. 2 ) The analysis of cognitive development also showed no significant difference (trachs mean = 80.77 (SD = 12.70), or median 85 (IQR) 75, 90) and nontrachs mean = 79.64 (SD = 11.05) or median 80 (IQR) 75, 85); p value = 0.729).

This is important, as some literature has postulated that the placement of a tracheostomy in an infant or child may independently contribute to neurodevelopmental delay. A study in 2003 suggested that mechanical interference of the tracheostomy tube with vocal cord function may contribute to abnormal language development, and that decannulation at the earliest possible time may ameliorate this effect [18] . It has also been postulated that disruption of airflow across the glottis, Eustachian tube dysfunction, or other causes of hearing loss may contribute to alterations in development of language skills [11] . However, the underlying comorbidities inherent with a diagnosis of severe BPD are not to be discounted. A 2018 secondary analysis of the ELGAN study by Sriram et al. demonstrated consistent intellectual impairment among children at 10 years of age who had a diagnosis of severe BPD on multiple neurocognitive tests [19] . In addition, infants with severe BPD scored lowest in multiple domains, including language and cognitive development [19] . Given this background in combination with our findings, it is reasonable to conclude that severe BPD itself confers developmental impairment, rather than the addition of a tracheostomy.",

First, the age at admission to our institution was significantly different between the two cohorts. This difference is likely due to the nature of the home ventilator program at our institution, which routinely accepts patients from surrounding level III NICUs who have been unable to wean off of positive pressure for various reasons, and ultimately require tracheostomy for long-term mechanical ventilation. Impact of tracheostomy on language and cognitive development in infants with severe bronchopulmonary. . . Second, the age at discharge was significantly higher for the tracheostomy group than for the control group. Several factors may lead to this difference, including the increased severity of illness in patients requiring tracheostomy, comorbidities, such as BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension and TBM, and the additional burden placed on families to learn the routine cares required to manage an infant with tracheostomy and assisted ventilation in a home setting. Furthermore, it can be challenging to find private duty home nursing for infants with tracheostomy and home ventilation for the population of patients who come from surrounding rural areas. This delay in discharge is not unique to our institution, and was recently highlighted by Maynard et al., who showed an increase in hospital stay of 35-53 days on average for children with home health care needs, a notable percentage of whom were born preterm and required tracheostomy [20] .",

Prior studies, such as a prospective cohort study by Keller et al. and a retrospective chart review by Strang et al. demonstrated white infants as the largest proportion of tracheostomy recipients [21] . However, both studies showed a greater proportion of male infants than female infants who received tracheostomy. The difference shown in our study may be due to the referral base, which is predominantly white, or may simply be due to artifact from the relatively small sample size. A larger cohort may more accurately depict representative demographics. Evaluation of the respiratory support required by each cohort is notable for the requirement of intubation for more infants with tracheostomy at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. It is a logical conclusion that the infants who required tracheostomy were more ill, and therefore required a higher level of respiratory support. This respiratory support difference highlights a larger proportion of infants who did not require tracheostomy who remained on positive pressure (either continuous positive airway pressure or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation) rather than requiring intubation at this same PMA. Of note, all infants who required nasal cannula required either high flow nasal cannula or >30% FiO 2 to meet the definition of severe BPD at 36 weeks' PMA. Although there is no consensus as to the appropriate timing for tracheostomy placement in infants with severe BPD, the median age for tracheostomy placement for our cohort was 41 ((IQR) 38.4, 44.1) weeks PMA, which is comparable with most regional centers.",

Since infants in both cohorts were cared for in the same NICU at the time of tracheostomy placement, one can conclude that the decision of whether or not to place a tracheostomy was made by the same physician groups. However, many patients were transferred to our center after hospitalization at outlying level III NICUs, with potentially different management prior to the time of transfer. This may represent a heterogeneous treatment paradigm for these patients, potentially impacting their ultimate need for tracheostomy. All patients identified were followed outpatient by the same institution, and had developmental testing done by two dedicated clinicians, limiting the potential for interpretation bias.",

It is worth noting that abstraction of the data for this project identified several patients from both groups who were unable to complete the subscale tests for receptive/expressive language and gross/fine motor components due to severe neurocognitive impairment and there may be a difference in outcome that could not be identified. Some recent literature suggests that Bayley III overestimates development. However, the comparison in this study showed no difference, suggesting that the two cohorts are equivalent. This is a very important observation as there is a growing evidence that suggests that chronic ventilation via a tracheostomy is beneficial to support the growth and development of infants with severe BPD [27] . When chronic respiratory insufficiency limits the BPD infant's ability to grow and develop, chronic invasive ventilation through a tracheostomy may be a better option to facilitate neurodevelopmental progress and may lead to an improved long-term outcome. Lastly, we were unable to control for intensity of outpatient therapies, which may differ between the two cohorts due to the Infant Home Ventilator program at Children's Mercy, which provides a robust and structured multidisciplinary approach to therapeutic follow up.",
