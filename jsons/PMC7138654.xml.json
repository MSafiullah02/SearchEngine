With many places still facing a drastic shortage of testing resources, what is the best way to deploy these scarce tests? In the United States (US), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) implemented strict criteria that a patient needed to satisfy to qualify for testing, including (1) physical symptoms of COVID-19; (2) recent travel to areas of an outbreak; and (3) direct contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19 [1]. Additional criteria to narrow allocation included individuals over age 65 years, frontline healthcare workers, and hospitalized patients.",

Back then, the US Army Air Forces brass were concerned with optimally placing armor on bomber planes, with the objective of maximizing the rate at which their pilots survived battle and returned home. Bombers returning from missions often had multitudes of scattered bullet holes. The army\u2019s initial instinct was to allocate scarce armor on those areas of the plane that were hit hardest. By focusing on the salient and hardest hit areas of the surviving planes, the army was systematically neglecting areas of the plane that when shot at were most vulnerable to crashing (e.g., the engines and cockpit). Abraham Wald, the Hungarian mathematician who defected to the US at the war\u2019s outbreak, recommended an altered strategy to improve aircraft survivability. By studying the distribution of bullet holes throughout multiple aircraft that returned, he deducted that planes needed continued protection of the engines and cockpit to continue returning home, so armor were placed systematically on these areas of all aircraft despite the observable data of bullet holes in the bomber fuselages [4].",

In terms of information theory, one objective of a test is to maximize the \u201csurprise\u201d that a person experiences when receiving a test result [7]. A test result that is not surprising and simply confirms a prior belief has limited value, particularly when tests are scarce. On the other hand, if a person has a strong belief that they are not infected, but then receives a positive test result, they will then likely exhibit a larger change in their behavior compared to a person who simply received confirmatory results. In addition, increasing the proportion of surprising test results will also be valuable to public health officials in painting a more accurate picture of the spread of the disease.",

Areas of the US geography that appear to be less impacted by the disease (e.g., West Virginia, Upper Midwest states, Mountain-West states), despite current data, could become problematic epicenters in the days and weeks to come given that these areas are unlikely to experience the same drastic behavioral shifts that locations like California and New York have adopted. Practical concerns will persist with this recommendation, such as distributing test kits to less population-dense areas where disease spread is still common (e.g., suburban areas) and convincing patients presenting with mild or no coronavirus symptoms to volunteer for testing.",
