The empirical analysis demonstrates that SOE policy burdens are significantly and positively correlated with senior executives' excessive perks, indicating that SOE policy burdens increase agency cost. The results hold after controlling for potential endogeneity. Moreover, we find the following evidences. Strategic policy burdens of SOEs have a significantly greater impact on their senior executives' excessive perks, compared with social policy burdens. The positive impact of SOE policy burdens on excessive perks is significantly weaker in east China due to the higher degree of marketization. The central government's stricter supervision can also alleviate the positive correlation between policy burdens of centrally administered SOEs and senior executives' excessive perks.",

Firstly, during the process of national economic development, most Chinese SOEs bear policy burdens imposed by the government (Lin et al., 1998) , including strategic policy burdens and the social policy burdens (Lin and Tan, 1999) . For example, the government directs SOEs to develop national strategic industries, regarding energy, communications and transportation etc. Besides, SOEs are required by the government to recruit redundant staff and not to lay off workers for the maintenance of social stability (Lin and Li, 2008) . The policy burdens serve as a means by which the government intervenes in the economy *",

            "text": "In recent years, there has been a series of events where managers of China's listed companies, especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs), abusing managerial power in their own interests at the firm's cost. Chinese media has exposed a number of listed companies, such as China Railway Construction Corporation and Zhuhai Gree Group, spending staggering amount of money on top managers' entertainment. A major stream of research investigates the causes of SOE senior executives' perk consumption from such aspects as the agency cost (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Hart,2001) , internal and external governance mechanisms (Brickley and James,1987; Yermack, 2006 ; Grinstein et al., 2017) , and management incentives (Rajan and Wulf, 2006) . However, there has been little research to examine the effect of policy burdens on the senior executives' perks under the socialist economy. (Li, 2008) . It is therefore difficult for the government to distinguish losses induced by policy burdens from those of SOEs' poor managerial performance. This challenge worsens information asymmetry and, in turn, increases agency cost which causes soft budget constraints, rent seeking, the moral hazard, managerial slacks, and corruption (Kornai,1980; Lin and Li, 2008 Secondly, it has been a focus of public concern in China that SOE senior executives consume perks for their own interests. Large consumption of perks could do harm to firm value. For example, in 2013, the annual accounting report of China Railway Construction Corporation, a large SOE engaged in railway construction, exposed an enormous sum of perks among which the entertainment expense reached $118 million, accounting for nearly 10% of the company's net profit that year. In addition, Chinese media reveal that managers of Sinopec's Guangdong Petroleum Branch and Zhuhai Gree Group consumed a large quantity of luxurious liquor. Atkinson and Stiglitz (2015) suggest that Chinese SOE managers are more likely to spend ludicrously on such things as food, clothing, housing, transportation, and entertainment at the company's expense. Some studies estimate perks can amount to 15%~32% of total executive compensation (Kato and Long, 2006) . Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study the perks of SOE executives.",

Based on a sample of listed SOEs over 2010-2018 period (5991 firm-year observations), we demonstrate that SOE policy burdens are significantly and positively associate with excessive managerial perks. We conduct robustness tests to mitigate the negative influence of endogeneity and find their results remain qualitatively robust. The further analysis suggests that strategic policy burdens of SOEs have stronger positive correlation with excessive perks than social policy burdens do. Additionally, the positive correlation between policy burdens and excessive perks is significantly weaker in eastern coastal provinces of China due to the higher degree of marketization. It is significantly mitigated in centrally administered SOEs (CSOEs) as they are subject to stricter supervision of Chinese central government.",

Previous studies generally attribute managers' perks to their agency behavior (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Hart, 2001; Yermack, 2006) , internal corporate governance mechanism (Brickley and James, 1987 gives rise to two competing views of perk consumption. The first view argues that perks are a tool for senior managers to misappropriate a firm's surplus (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Hart, 2001; Yermack, 2006) . The alternative view is that perks can be an incentive in an optimal employment contract to motivate employees (Fama, 1980; Rajan and Wulf, 2006) . However, it indicates that managerial perks can be a result of both agency costs and nonmonetary incentives (Cai et al., 2011) . In our study, we follow Luo et al. (2011) to separate senior executives' excessive perks and examine its relationship with SOE policy burdens, which thus enriches the research on perk consumption.",

Jensen and Meckling (1976) point out, due to the separation of ownership and management, managers tend to seek perks by misappropriating corporate resources, which is detrimental to the firm value. Large consumption of perks could be incurred in the businesses where their managerial ownership is small and corporate governance is weak. The consumption of perks is more likely to be found in mature companies which possess less growth opportunities but more cash flow (Grossman and Hart, 1983; Jensen, 1986) . Likewise, Hart (2001) proves that perks are derived from executives' exploitation of the corporate resources in their own interests. Subsequent research finds that senior executives' perk consumption has negative influence on the enterprises. It could foster low morale, drastically reducing corporate performance (Yermack, 2006) . Managerial perks are associated with poor accounting disclosures (Gul et al., 2011) .",

Third, enhanced SEC disclosure requirements impose greater pressure on managerial perks. Grinstein et al.

Fourth, the implementation of the political and economic system reform alleviates the consumption of managerial perks. Xin and Tan (2009) find that China's market-oriented reform may reduce the perks of SOEs' senior executives. Fang et al. (2018) discover that the perks used to build political rapport declined after the 18 th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, or after the anti-corruption campaign. However, CEOs, especially of centrally administered SOEs in China, who subject to pay restrictions imposed by Chinese central government, make more perk consumption in their own interest (Bae et al., 2019) In contrast, perks are not necessarily to the detriment of shareholders, instead it can be used to stimulate productivity (Rajan and Wulf, 2006) . Perks may serve as a component of a complex compensation package to motivate employees to work harder and thus may actually increase firm value (Fama, 1980) . Marino and Zabojnik (2008) find that more perks would be awarded in firms in more uncertain production environments and firms with better corporate governance.

In 1950s, Chinese government realized that in order to transform China from an underdeveloped agricultural country into a developed industrial one, it had to establish an independent and complete industrial system. The key foundation is heavy industry. Therefore, since the first five-year plan, Chinese government has given priority to the development of heavy industry, and the subsequent five-year plans follow this development strategy. The heavy industry normally requires decades to develop with huge investment. However, as an underdeveloped agricultural country, China featured scarce capital and sufficient labor. It violated the theory of comparative advantage to develop heavy industry. Thus, private enterprises were unwilling to invest in heavy industry. SOEs were then required to prioritize the development of heavy industry, which is strategic policy burdens (Lin and Tan, 1999) . The imbalanced industry development strategy couldn't ensure enough jobs for urban residents, which negatively impact social stability. In order to provide sufficient job positions, the government asked SOEs to hire as many workers as possible. That is SOE social policy burdens. Since 1980s, SOEs have experienced many market-oriented reforms, which aim to enhance the vitality of enterprises, separate government from enterprise administration and expand SOEs' operating rights. But SOEs still served as a tool of Chinese government to make up for market defects and consolidate the foundation of the socialist economic system, which gives them a leading role in the national economy. The Decision of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15 th Central Committee states that state-owned economy should control industries and sectors which play an important role in national economic security, such as energy, communications, transportation and high-tech industry. The report of the 18 th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) states that \"We must unswervingly consolidate and develop the state-owned economy. We will promote more investment of state-owned capital in important industries and key areas that are vital to national security and the lifeblood of the national economy, and continuously enhance the vitality, control and influence of the state-owned economy.\" SOEs are an important force in ensuring the implementation of the primary national strategies, promoting economic and social development, and strengthening overall national strength. Thus, SOEs bear certain economic, political, and social responsibilities.",

Many scholars believe competitive market mechanism can alleviate the aforementioned agency problems (Megginson et al., 2001 ). On the one hand, the competitiveness mechanism in the product market could mitigate information asymmetry between managers and owners. The profit status of an industry is public information in a fully competitive market. Shareholders can assess a manager's performance by comparing with the actual profit status of the company (Stigler and Friedland, 1983) . Such public information also enables shareholders to structure a manager's remuneration package based on their performance comparison, and therefore, discourage shirking and opportunistic behaviors (Grossman and Hart, 1983 ; Gupta et al., 2017) . On the other hand, the competitive manager market could restrain the agency behaviors of executives by means of its reputation mechanism. Fama (1980) argue that in a competitive manager market, managers are self-conscious about their performance record and will constantly seek market rewards. Competent managers will be hired with high salaries, and the rewards offered by their employers will be equivalent to the value of managers' human capital.",

They are considered as a kind of agency cost(Jensen and Meckling, 1976;   Grossman and Hart,1983;Yermack, 2006). However,Rajan and Wulf (2006) argue perks can be used to stimulate productivity.Cai et al., (2011) propose that perks are complicated expenses, including reasonable perks derived from non-monetary incentives, and excessive perks resulted from senior executives' agency behaviors. This paper aims to examine the influence of SOE policy burdens on agency cost. Therefore, we set excessive perks as dependent variable in model (1).We take two steps to estimate excessive perks. Firstly, data of SOE senior executives' perks are drawn from the footnotes of cash flow statements. According to China Accounting Standards, both direct and indirect cash payment resulted from major operating activities should be disclosed under \"other cash payment related to operating activities\" in the cash flow statement. Chen et al.(2010) regard the following expenses as perks such as office expenses, travel expenses, business entertainment expenses, communications expenses, overseas training expenses, vehicle expenses and conference fees.

The mean value of Tenure of SOEs is 5.985 years, with the longest tenure up to 17 years.

This is because China's Listed Companies Corporate Governance Standards stipulate that the proportion of independent directors on the board of directors of listed companies should not be less than one third.

The HHI ranges from 0.013 to 0.640, indicating that the ownership concentration varies among SOEs.

The coefficient for the correlation between ExPerk and Burden is significantly positive, implying the positive relationship between SOE policy burdens and senior executives' excessive perks. ExPerk has a significant negative correlation with Asset, indicating that excessive perks of large-scale SOEs are relatively low. It could be because centrally administered SOEs are large in scale but subject to strict supervision, which leads to lower agency cost. ExPerk is significantly negatively related with Lev, indicating that liabilities play a certain role in corporate governance. ExPerk has significantly positive relationship with NCF and ROA. It suggests excessive perks are prevalent in firms with large cash reserve and higher profit or return on assets. ExPerk is significantly positively related with Dual and Tenure, indicating that the more power a manager possesses or the longer he holds office, the more excessive perks occur.

SOE policy burdens bring negative impact on SOE performance while government support induced is beneficial to their performance. It leads to slight correlation between SOE corporate and ExPerk has significantly negative correlations with control variables such as Asset, Direct, Independent and HHI. It implies that larger SOEs have less excessive perks. Lower agency cost could be brought about by stricter supervision of SOE executives in light of centrally administered SOEs' larger scale, larger board size, more independent directors, and more highly concentrated ownership. ExPerk significantly and positively relates with ROA, indicating that more excessive perks are incurred in SOEs with rich profits. However, ExPerk has significantly positive relationship with Dual and Age, suggesting that the more powerful managers are or the closer they are to retirement age, the more excessive perks they could consume Although we control SOE financial characteristics and corporate governance in the main test, it still cannot completely avoid omitted variable bias. Omitted variables may results in the fact that independent variables and residuals are not independent, which could generate endogeneity. To alleviate the endogeneity concerns in our study, we employ panel regression with industry-year fixed effects to control for correlated omitted variable bias.Table 5reports the empirical results of fixed effect model.
