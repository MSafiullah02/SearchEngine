There is increasing evidence that opioids contribute to perioperative and ICU bowel dysfunction [2]. Studies have demonstrated that bowel dysfunction in the critically ill is associated with adverse outcomes including delay in gastric emptying leading to increased gastro-oesophageal reflux and aspiration, decreased enteral feeding, delayed ICU discharge and increased mortality [3\u20135]. Restoration of bowel function is beneficial in establishing enteral feeding; it prevents bacterial translocation, alleviates gastrointestinal discomfort due to constipation and shortens ICU stay [6].",

Randomisation lists were prepared by the trial statistician and concealed from all clinical investigators. The treatment group received methylnaltrexone (a colourless liquid) dosed as per the summary of product characteristics: patients weighing 38\u201361 kg received 8 mg (0.4 mL) methylnaltrexone diluted in 50 mL of 0.9% saline; patients weighing 62\u2013114 kg received 12 mg (0.6 mL) methylnaltrexone diluted in 50 mL of 0.9% saline. The control group received placebo (saline) prepared in identical syringes to the study drug. Both groups received the blinded study drugs over 15 min via an indwelling intravenous catheter. An unblinded research nurse who was not involved in any clinical management of the patient or any data collection, carried out the preparation and administration of study drugs. All clinical staff (medical, nursing and pharmacy) as well as patients and relatives remained blinded to treatment allocation for the duration of the study. The patient continued to receive the study drugs at the same time daily, until the patient was free of opioids for 24 h or at 28 days.

Pilot data suggested that a difference in efficacy of this magnitude would be reasonable in the ICU setting (71% vs 0% opened bowels within 12 h) [11]. Allowing for a drop-out rate of 5% (patients who withdraw consent after regaining consciousness), with 42 subjects in each arm (26 events) this study had 85% power to detect a difference of 33% (48% vs 15%) in the proportion of patients with rescue-free laxation within 12 h at the 5% level (using a two-tailed log-rank test). All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis. Cox regression, stratified by ICU, was used to estimate the effect of treatment group on time to rescue-free laxation. Patients who did not achieve rescue free laxation were censored at the date rescue laxatives were given, or, if none were given, at 96 h after randomisation. The appropriateness of the proportional hazards assumption was verified by including a term for interaction between treatment group and time in the model. Two sensitivity analyses were performed; first, the Cox regression analysis was repeated with stratification by ICU and adjustment for age, sex, APACHE II score, type of opioid and other sedatives and second, with stratification by ICU and time measured from the when the study drug was started rather than randomisation. Secondary outcomes were summarized using basic descriptive methods and presented for the placebo and methylnaltrexone groups separately, and in total (further details in Supplementary Information). Differences in secondary outcomes between the placebo and methylnaltrexone groups were assessed using appropriate hypothesis tests. There was no adjustment for multiple testing. Owing to the short observation period, a competing risk analysis to account for deaths was not required.",

There was a marked difference in mortality between the methylnaltrexone and placebo groups. Ten deaths were reported in the methylnaltrexone group and two in the placebo group during the 28 day follow-up period. Post-hoc survival analyses showed that this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.007, log rank test). The corresponding Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. There were no deaths within the first 3 days (72 h) and none occurred prior to the primary endpoint being observed. Clinical records of the deceased participants were reviewed and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Related Products Authority informed, but there was no indication that the difference was study drug-related. We therefore performed a number of post-hoc Cox-regression analyses to investigate whether the observed difference in survival might be explained by differences in baseline risk of death, assessed using the following measures: original APACHE II risk of death, APACHE UK 2013, APACHE UK 2015, ICNARC model 2013, ICNARC model 2015 and SAPSII score. The expected number of deaths in each treatment group is reported in Supplementary Table 7 with estimates ranging from 12.38 to 15.30 for the placebo group and from 11.34 to 14.61 in the methylnaltrexone group. The number of observed deaths in both treatment groups was less than expected but the discrepancy was far greater in the placebo group. Adjustment for age, sex, centre, reason for admission to ICU (medical or surgical) in addition to baseline risk of death (whichever method/score used) did not explain the observed difference in survival between the treatment groups.",

During the course of the \u201cgestation\u201d period for this study, attitudes to managing sedation had been evolving and it is conceivable that clinical staff were targeting lighter levels of sedation for most patients. The practice of daily sedation holds has become more established [13] thus reducing the duration of significant opiate dosing. 40% of patients were off opioids or receiving prolonged sedation holds on Day 2, hence the impact of opioids on constipation and the advantage of reversing this specifically with an opioid antagonist is diminished. Constipation in critical care patients is multifactorial, but the opioid component over time may have become less significant. The pre-trial levels of constipation which we had anticipated in the placebo group, based on our previous work, did not materialise. In fact, the placebo group had a higher incidence of subsequent diarrhoea and passed more stools. Possibly the increased attention on bowel function and protocolised prescriptions (all patients received senna prior to enrolment) had a major impact on the placebo arm event rate, thus undermining the assumptions on which the trial had been planned and the sample size calculated.",
