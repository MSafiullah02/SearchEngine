RV approach has been successfully applied on many prokaryotes, but there are very few known applications on eukaryotes and viruses. So, it is worthwhile to explore the potential of this approach to identify potential vaccine candidates for coronavirus. RV basically does the in silico examination of the viral proteome to hunt antigenic and surface-exposed proteins. This approach was initially applied successfully to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (Kelly and Rappuoli 2005) against which none of the prevailing techniques could develop a vaccine. The present book chapter is intended to explore the potential of RV approach to select the probable vaccine candidates against coronavirus and validate the results using docking studies.",

            "text": "Undoubtedly, the traditional approaches for vaccine development are fortunate enough to efficiently resist the alarming pathogenic diseases of its time. However, the traditional approach suffers from certain limitations like it is very timeconsuming, the pathogens which can't be cultivated in the lab conditions are out of reach, and certain non-abundant proteins are not accessible using this approach (Rappuoli 2000) . Consequently, a number of pathogenic diseases are left without any vaccine against them. All these limitations are conquered by reverse vaccinology approach utilizing genome sequence information which ultimately is translated into proteins. Hence all the proteins expressed by the genome are accessible irrespective of their abundance, conditions in which they expressed. The credit of fame of reverse vaccinology should go to the advancements in the sequencing strategies worldwide. Accordingly, improvement in the sequencing technologies has flooded the genome databases with huge amount of data which can be computationally undertaken to reveal the various crucial aspects of the virulence factors of the concerned pathogen. Reverse vaccinology is based on same approach of computationally analysing the genome of pathogen and proceeds step by step to ultimately identify the highly antigenic, secreted proteins with high epitope densities. The best epitopes are selected as potential vaccine candidates (Pizza et al. 2000) . This approach has brought the unapproachable pathogens of interest in spotlight and is evolving as the most reassuring tool for precise selection of vaccine candidates and brought the use of peptide vaccines in trend (Sette and Rappuoli 2010; Kanampalliwar et al. 2013 ).",

            "text": "Bexsero is the first universal serogroup B meningococcal vaccine developed using RV, and it has currently earned positive judgement from the European Medicines Agency (Gabutti 2014) . Whether it is discovery of pili in gram-positive pathogens which were thought to not have any pili or the sighting of factor G-binding protein in meningococcus (Alessandro and Rino 2010), the reverse vaccinology steals all the credits from other conventional approaches. Most of the applications of RV are against prokaryotes and very few against eukaryotes and viruses because of complexity of their genome. Corynebacterium urealyticum (Guimar\u00e3es et al. 2015) , Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Monterrubio-L\u00f3pez et al. 2015) , H. pylori (Naz et al. 2015) , Acinetobacter baumannii (Chiang et al. 2015) , Rickettsia prowazekii (Caro-Gomez et al. 2014) , Neospora caninum (Goodswen et al. 2014) and Brucella melitensis (Vishnu et al. 2017) are the examples of some pathogens that are recently approached using this in silico technique in order to spot some epitopes having potential of being a vaccine candidate. Herpesviridae (Bruno et al. 2015 ) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Kolesanova et al. 2015) are the examples of the viruses that are addressed using this approach. (Altschul et al. 1990; Okonechnikov et al. 2012; Golosova et al. 2014) .

However, five proteins are acidic and show negative charge. The negative GRAVY score of five proteins justify them to be of hydrophilic nature with majority of the residues positioned towards the surface. For the rest of six proteins, the GRAVY score is positive; it means that these are The accession number and identity of orthologs obtained in different strains is shown in the table hydrophobic proteins. The proteins with less than 40 value of instability index are quite stable than those with higher values. All the proteins are having the molecular weight less than 110 kDa except 3 (YP_009047202.1, YP_009047203.1 and YP_009047204.1). This exhibits the effectiveness of lightweight proteins as targets as they can be easily purified because of their low molecular weights. The protein YP_009047204.1 is reported as a spike glycoprotein. It is acidic with prominent negative charge, with negative GRAVY score which suggests its hydrophilicity and Figure 15 .2 depicts the subcellular localization of proteins of the seed genome, i.e. MERS-CoV. Only one protein was predicted to be localized in host cytoplasm, four in host membrane, two in both host cell membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) while two in only ER, and two are left unrecognized. The known spike protein is predicted to be localized in host ER. From these results we decided to pick the proteins which are located in host membrane or were predicted to be localized in both host membrane and ER. The two are known envelop protein and membrane protein from bibliographic studies, and along with that, the known spike protein was also included in the filtered results. Out of the filtered proteins, only two (YP_009047210.1 and YP_009047208.1) contain more than two transmembrane helices, therefore filtered out.
