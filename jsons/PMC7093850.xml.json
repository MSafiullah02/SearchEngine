The patients were classified using the uveitis nomenclature according to the recommendations of the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature working group 2005.31 All patients had undergone the uveitis screening consisting of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red and white blood cell counts, determination of serum angiotensin\u2013converting enzyme levels, serologic tests for syphilis, and chest radiography. Selected patients also underwent serologic testing for Borrelia burgdorferi. For all 629 patients aqueous sampling was performed for diagnostic purposes. The samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C within 5 hours of collection before processing for laboratory analysis. Initial analysis was performed for HSV, VZV, and in the case of posterior uveitis also for Toxoplasma and CMV, by PCR and by Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWC), to determine intraocular antibody production. Of the 629 patients, 486 were negative for the above mentioned agents. A sufficient amount of ocular fluid remained for this study in 139 of these cases. Forty-nine patients had anterior uveitis (AU) and 90 had posterior uveitis (PU) or panuveitis (Table 1). Of the 49 AU patients, 2 were immunocompromised as a result of immunosuppressive medications (1 for lethal midline granuloma and the other after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancy). Of the 90 patients with PU and panuveitis, 8 were immunocompromised, 5 of whom had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and 3 of whom received immunosuppressive drugs (Table 1).",

If not done previously, samples from patients with anterior uveitis were also analyzed for CMV and Toxoplasma. DNA and RNA were extracted from 30 \u03bcL of ocular fluid using the MagNa Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid isolation kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). To monitor the quality of the extraction and the subsequent amplification procedure, a standard dose of phocine herpesvirus type 1 and encephalomyocarditis virus was added to each sample as an internal control prior to extraction.32, 33, 34 Nucleic acid was collected in a volume of 240 \u03bcL. For detection of RNA viruses, copyDNA (cDNA) was produced by mixing 40 \u03bcL of extracted nucleic acid with 60 \u03bcL of reverse transcriptase mix (Taqman, reverse transcription reagents; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) and incubating the mixture for 10 minutes at 25\u00b0C and 30 minutes at 48\u00b0C. The cDNA synthesis reaction was stopped by incubating for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C. Per amplification reaction 10 \u03bcL of extracted nucleic acid (for DNA detection) or 10 \u03bcL of cDNA (for RNA detection) was used. Real-time PCR assays were performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, New Jersey, USA). For Chlamydia trachomatis, 25 \u03bcL of extracted nucleic acid was analyzed using the Cobas Amplicor Chlamydia trachomatis detection kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche). All samples were examined once. In case of positive outcomes the real-time PCR reaction was repeated. Two human parechovirus\u2013positive samples were confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing. Samples for which the internal control was inhibited were excluded. The primers and probes used are listed in Table 2.\n",

IgG analysis in these 3 patients did not show any evidence of intraocular antibody production against EBV. The presence of EBV genome in the eyes of patients with various causes of uveitis was demonstrated previously and was found independent of the clinical diagnosis. The clinical significance of this phenomenon has not yet been established.18, 36, 37 Moreover, as in our study, Ongkosuwito and associates found EBV also in ocular fluids from patients with laboratory-confirmed toxoplasmosis and in ocular fluids of patients without ocular inflammation.18 Apparently, PCR detection of EBV in ocular fluids should be interpreted with caution, and may in most cases be considered an epiphenomenon, mostly likely attributable to the presence of EBV in B cells present in the inflamed eye. Further studies combining PCR and intraocular antibody production analysis are required to determine whether EBV is a true cause of intraocular inflammation.",

Antibody analysis of the ocular fluid by immunofluorescence assay did not reveal the presence of intraocular IgG against HHV6. However, absence of intraocular antibody production does not necessarily exclude intraocular infection. Previously, we reported that by simultaneous use of PCR and GWC in immunocompetent patients a diagnosis by PCR only was established in 9% of cases.2 Moreover, de Boer and associates found that in patients with presumed herpetic anterior uveitis, PCR was more frequently positive than GWC.43 HHV6 has been implicated in ocular inflammation, most notably when the posterior part of the eye was affected.14, 15, 17, 19 Our patient had anterior uveitis with heterochromia that had been present since childhood. Heterochromia is classically associated with FHUS but can develop in other viral infections such as HSV or VZV.44 The detection of HHV6 in the eye might not be a clinically relevant finding; however, like other (herpes)viruses, HHV6 can reside latently in cells of the lymphoid and myeloid lineage, and it may have entered the inflamed eye via immune cells, similar to HIV and possibly EBV.6, 18, 19, 36, 45 The role of HHV6 as a cause of anterior uveitis is inconclusive and further studies are required.",

First, the uveitis might be of noninfectious origin. Second, the number of DNA or RNA copies present in the ocular samples may have been below the detection level. This may be attributable to the low amount of input nucleic acid, which is inherent to diagnostic assays with intraocular fluid. Alternatively, the time of sampling may have been such that the causative agent had already been cleared from the eye. In this case, other diagnostic approaches may be more useful, such as the detection of intraocular antibody production by Goldmann-Witmer coefficient calculation. It is known, also for systemic and neurologic viral infections, that a PCR assay is most sensitive early in infection, whereas antibody can be detected over a much longer period of time and thus provide a wider window of detection.2, 43, 47, 48 Finally, it may be that other pathogens not covered by our assays were involved in these cases.",
