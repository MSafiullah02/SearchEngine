            "text": "One of the themes permeating this volume, which explains partly the problems of the African health care system, is that corruption plays a major harmful role in Africa, and not the lack of financial resources to fix it. Writing on the failure of primary health care in Nigeria, Omar Massoud has found, indeed, that things are not done well not because of the lack of resources and says (2012: 21):The ineffectiveness of local government in Nigeria to provide basic services to local communities has been mainly attributed to the lack of sufficient financial resources. Financial inadequacy, we believe, is not a key constraint or obstacle to effective service delivery. This is because although local governments do not receive as much, both in terms of absolute revenues per capita and in terms of the total share of public expenditures vis-\u00e0-vis the state and federal governments, their functional responsibilities are correspondingly limited.\n",

The corrupt ways at African hospitals, clinics, health centers, and other health facilities is widely known not only among the governmental and ministerial authorities but also by the people seeking treatment themselves, and is a subject of daily conversation. Lack of accountability in the use and disappearance of the patrimonial resources and some of the practices by doctors and auxiliaries make a mockery of the system that spends millions of dollars without enforcement against abuses and with virtually no one being incarcerated when irregularities are found.",

            "text": "The drawback over corruption, which means in most people\u2019s minds illegal or unethical appropriation of public or donor private funds, also called official thievery, or unauthorized use of public property, such as vehicles and gasoline, or the conscious contravening of regulations or laws for personal gain or convenience, is that accurate data on expenses are difficult to find and record, as they are often based on hearsay, suspicion, and innuendo, and lack the actual information on the scope and method of transaction, when it occurs. Invariably, it is mired in secrecy, especially at the high levels of authority, where great amounts of funds are channeled to a person, a president, a government minister, or a group of individuals who swear secrecy. What is frequently easy to detect and record are the hundreds of daily petty corruptive practices one encounters on the road on the part of the police, a government office where lower and higher level officials are required to dispense an original official document, such as a visa, to citizens, quick and effective treatment of a patient unfairly ahead of others at a hospital, hiring at a government establishment, or payment of funds to get a favor, often dubbed bribery, even though the latter may not involve money but sex, false testimony, and other subtle demands. Political corruption usually refers to paying people secretly to vote for a certain party or candidate, \u201crigging,\u201d or stealing an election through unfair and non-transparent practices that may alter the results of a political process. Thus, the \u201cinvisible hand,\u201d as the shady transactions\u2019 agents are known, can be found in every sector of life.",

            "text": "At times, however, kleptomaniacs of government and national property have been caught red handed. In Africa, corruption is a daily practice and sometimes involves millions of dollars. There have been instances, for example, where some portion of the public budget, a percentage of international donations, or investment funds have gone to government officials or researchers\u2014say 10% of $300 million\u2014to facilitate approval by the local authorities. Very rarely, though, have such thieves been denounced and imprisoned. Transparency International defines corruption \u201cas the abuse of public resources for private gain.\u201d Studies have been conducted on corruption, especially in the developing world, and the opinion of the experts is not too disparate in their view of it as a detrimental practice to everyone involved. Mavuto Kalulu has provided a summary of the major findings of the studies conducted on the subject, which we briefly note here. Mauro\u2019s 1995 study, for example, found that corruption slows and stifles economic growth by lowering national or private investment. In his research, Mauro showed that \u201ccorruption has a negative and significant relationship with human capital, measured by the average schooling years in the population over age 25\u201d (Kalulu 2015). While Tanzi and Davoodi (2001) claimed that corruption is detrimental to the quality of public investments, Gupta et al. (2001), in one of the few studies focusing on its impact on the quality of health care services, conclude that \u201cchild mortality rates in highly corrupt countries are about one-third higher than in the less corrupt countries\u201d (Kalulu 2014).",

The well known Samuel Huntington (1968) seems to defend corruption and bribery, as he sees it as a way of breaking the red tape barriers of highly centralized bureaucracies and making the delivery of services efficient and rapid. Another scholar, F.T. Liu (1985) defended the proposition that corruptive practices often reduce the time one spends on queues. Finally, some view corruption as beneficial by stressing the key economic assumption that self-interest enhances prosperity because competition ensures that \u201ca product is purchased by those who value it the most; thus firms that are willing to pay more in bribes are awarded contracts.\u201d This sounds like a twisted way of looking at unethical \u201ctransactions\u201d (Kalulu 2014: 511), because one wrong, immoral, or unethical behavior cannot justify the ends, even if its results might benefit certain people, just like when the benevolent \u201cbank bandit,\u201d who distributes all the money robbed from the banks to the poor.",

The corrupt practices in Cameroon hospitals, for example, which are well known and have become partly responsible for lack of appropriate care for the Cameroonian citizens, especially the poor and the illiterate, are highlighted by Cameroonian scholar Victor Bayemi in his study of the two main hospitals, Lanquintinie and Deido, in Doula, Cameroon, where there was one doctor per 7,023 people, one nurse for every 1,784 people, and one pharmacy for 5,016 inhabitants some decades ago. In 1998 and 1999, consecutively, Cameroon was classified by Transparency International as being among the most corrupt countries in the world, with unbelievable inequities, where the poor do not have access to basic health services, and the care provided is one of the worse in quality (Bayemi 2008: 34). These conditions worsened after the government reduced doctors\u2019 salary. Calling them \u201ca tripolar corrupt organization, Bayemi classifies health care facilities in Douala into public hospitals, private hospitals, and informal health centers. Corrupt practices, he says, can be found in every sector related to the hospitals, be it in radiology, testing laboratories, pharmacy, screening, medicine purchase, and consultations.",

Desperate, the patient cannot but comply and pays the fee \u201cunder the table.\u201d If not, he may have to wait for days or, discouraged by the delay, simply give up and leave. In the lab and radiology, it is the same story: Equipment is not working or a film or a reactor is needed, the doctor claims, and, at the end, the patient will have to pay (2008), even though the test is supposed to be free. At the pharmacy, the practice is for the pharmacist to sell the samples he is supposed to provide free to customers. These are designed for testing or advertisement. During consultations, some doctors falsify the results of the diagnosis and ask the patient to buy and write prescriptions that benefit them and not the patients; doctors might write prescriptions for the free medicine they have in their possession and make a profit out of it. In many cases, the doctors personally ask for a sum of money before they can treat the patient beyond what the patient must pay officially to the hospital.",

Frequently, the doctor receives the patient at his informal health center, which is usually his house, or someone else\u2019s residence, and might force him or her to pay the sum to the proprietor, because the latter does not have a license to open the \u201ccenter.\u201d In other words, almost anywhere in Africa, the doctor is expected to be at the public facility during business hours, but he often practices on weekends and evenings at his own private clinic, perhaps located in his home, \u201cattending on a fee-for-service basis to make more money from his services\u201d (Spielberg and Adams 2011: 14).

His house becomes a place where people come informally and pay him whatever amount of fee he asks for. Here, he may be assisted by a nurse or even by a relative of the patient. He also works at his private office or at a private hospital. He may leave his public service for several hours to attend the patients at the private establishment. No matter what goes on, the person that is managing the business is the doctor. The doctor may also refer the patients to his private facility or to the informal center, and collects all the proceeds thereof. As proof of corruptive practices, at the public hospital, the extra compensation he forces the patients to pay is not recorded by the official treasurer. This results in confusion in the minds of the patients (and the treasurer), Bayemi explains. All informal and formal office payments to the doctor carry no receipts. The doctor is always trying to find a way of making more money from the patients, making it appear legitimate, thus creating another (ethical) confusion between \u201ccorruption with thievery\u201d and \u201cthievery with corruption.\u201d Obviously, the person that suffers from all the deceitful machinations is the patient, especially the poor, and the public hospital. The result is that the health facilities, which are supposed to be free or cheaper for the patients, become more expensive, forcing many to try to receive treatment at private hospitals and the informal centers. As a result, Bayemi says:Dans la mesure o\u00f9 la corruption suscite l\u2019accroissement des prix des soins m\u00e9dicaux, elle emp\u00eache \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital public d\u2019accomplir sa mission qui consiste \u00e0 faciliter l\u2019access de la majorit\u00e9 des patients de la population aux soins.

The public hospital becomes, in a true sense, the recruiting ground for the doctor\u2019s private practice. Can one find more despicable unethical behavior than the one witnessed at some of the hospitals in Africa? One other consequence of the corrupt practices is people\u2019s distrust of the public hospitals. It is also common in Cameroon hospitals that the doctor will hire hustlers or brokers who stay around the entrance to the hospital throughout the day and ask the patient which doctor they would like to see. With a fee paid to the broker, which is split with the physician, the patient is able to see the doctor quickly, bypassing other patients who might have been waiting for hours. People know this but no one has the courage to denounce the physician involved for fear of retaliation. Those who refuse to pay may be waiting indefinitely.",

            "text": "Finally, we might say that, once trust in the leadership is lost, nothing significant can be accomplished. Commenting on the leadership crisis in Africa and using the recent Ebola virus outbreak in West-Central Africa, Remy Adenoma wrote in The Guardian in September 2014 that \u201ctrust is in short supply in Africa\u201d today, the reason why people refused to believe what the leaders, including their own presidents, were telling them about the epidemic, which they considered to be a hoax. In Nigeria, for example, despite promises of an infusion of millions of dollars to treat the sick and pay the daily wages of the health care givers, nurses, and doctors, people took the leaders\u2019 words as a bunch of lies, as Adenoma points out, given that \u201cThe government is still owing medical personnel overdue allowances it seems unwilling to pay, so people fear risking their lives with no back up\u201d (Adenoma 2014: 2). The mistrust and cynicism, he says, is not caused by the actions of the politicians alone but of virtually all strangers, citizens or not, who are said to rob and steal the property of some and kidnap others. Policemen do not seem to care about enforcing the laws and are constantly seeking bribes to perform their duties, while many government officials embezzle state funds at all cost for themselves and their families. Adenoma concludes by noting:The worst legacy of the current crop of crooked African rulers is not the poor infrastructure, the lack of proper healthcare or even corruption; it is the seed of doubt and mistrust that their actions have sown in people\u2019s minds. Road and highways can be built in the space of a few years and Ebola outbreak will most likely be curbed within a few months, but the deep mistrust and cynicism pervasive in many African societies will continue to impede progress on the continent for decades to come.

            "text": "Adenoma is quick to point out, however, that corruption is not unique to Africa; it occurs in the Western world and other parts of the globe as well but not in the magnitude or the obvious and widely known level of corrupt behavior as on the African continent. People in other parts of the world know that, when there is a serious crisis, they can count on their government to protect them: Not in Africa, says Adenoma. Adenoma certainly has a point but cynicism and distrust, to this author, are not only based on corruption and lack of follow-up on the promises, conditions that have created a leadership crisis, especially in health in Africa. More important is the apparent lack of commitment to the welfare of the people, especially in health; the lack of clear priorities that place citizens at center-stage; the lack of vision of the future and a sense of entitlement among our leaders; the lack of investment of resources; the prevailing sense of utter powerlessness among the African people; and the blatant misuse of the national treasury\u2014as is the case in Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, Chad, and Liberia. Resources are siphoned daily on behalf of the leaders, their families, relatives, friends, fellow kin, and their crony supporters who may not even realize what is going on. Unfortunately, when they assume political responsibility, leaders seem not to realize that their position is a sacred trust and a privilege and not an entitlement or a birth right. In his short but brilliant chapter \u201cOn the Poverty of Health Politics in Africa: Are Governments Doing Enough?\u201d Binna Innocent Hunan, writing from his own living experience on the continent, first refutes David Bailey\u2019s insinuation that corruption in developing countries is \u201cnot necessarily antipathetic to the development of modern economic and social systems; that corruption serves in part at least a beneficial function in developing societies\u201d (1966: 719). He then mercilessly concludes by laying bare the unclothed \u201cemperors\u201d of Africa, calling their governance pathologic, one that breeds only pain for the African people. Then he goes on to note that his chapter\u2026situates the question of African ill-health in social terms and insists that this has arisen as a result of leadership proclivities to pursue parochial interests disguised as the collective good. Consequently, policies have had to be tailored to suit leadership interests rather than focus on easing the pains of the downtrodden masses. It pontificates that orchestrated wars and official thievery can only contribute to the problems of African people mired in structural dependence. The need for positive in Africa is strong: leadership which is not only seen, but expresses genuine concerns in acting to remove Africa and its people from these crippling problems of war and conflict, power economics, de-industrialization, squalor, and disease. The new dawn may well begin to save Africans of such odd epithets as \u201cpredatory, prebendal, parasitic\u2026kleptocratic, venal [or] vampire state. (Ihuna 2008: 312)\n",

With a high profile of unemployed among the employable youth suffering from economic crisis, Africa cannot be saved from either rural or urban anarchy,\u201d as these \u201cbecome ready tools for mischief and mayhem.\u201d Claire Wendland notes the same problems in Malawi medical schools, even though they are not related directly to private practice, which anger the medical students who focus their conversations on the waste of funds resulting from corrupt practices, continuing to create a wave of unrest due to official corruption. These crooked financial practices, Wendland noticed, \u201cnot only diverted resources away from the health sector but also could divert resources within the health sector toward certain favored constituencies or patients.\u201d There were cases including where an MP hoarded medications and had his relatives sell \u201cthe hospital\u2019s scarce resources in the public market, and even though complaints were formally leveled against him but the involved doctor [who was posted in the rural area as a district officer], was not punished\u201d (Wendland 2010: 141\u2013141). Another expert notes that the hospitals and health facilities often do not have the workforce needed or the latter may be reserved just for the elite, as Niang notes, where public control of the public structures does not exist, that is, there is no accountability to the people; resources reserved for the hospitals are constantly reduced (or reserved for the powerful and the wealthy); and investment in hygiene is never considered to be a priority (Niang 2008: 29). One should then rightly ask: \u201cQuo vadis, Africa?\u201d Cameroon is just an example, but corrupt practices in the health sector are widespread in Africa and successful because they focus mainly on the sick, the illiterate, the poor, the disadvantaged, the disabled, and ethnic minorities, who are the most vulnerable citizens in the country.",

Medical tourism has been described as \u201ca new global economy in which technology is erasing geographical boundaries, and companies are taking advantage of the lower costs and greater efficiency they can find abroad\u201d (Thomas Friedman 2005). It means traveling across continents to get the best medical treatment possible, as perceived by the patients, at the most affordable price. The aging baby boomers and, therefore, the growing number of the elderly who are more prone to ill health, have been forced to travel to such places as India, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, and even to Eastern European countries. The movement has also included people from the industrialized countries who are so proud, at least in public, of their own health care systems. They, too, are looking for treatment bargains in the developing world. Unfortunately in Africa, only South Africa, with its tourist packages, has been able to attract this wave of medical tourists. In sum, medical tourists are not necessarily seeking the lowest cost but quality treatment of their ills along with short waiting periods, to satisfy those needs that are hard to meet at home, unavailable procedures, new and old health products, as well as privacy, opportunities for vacation, and relaxing spots away from home.",

It is estimated that 90% of medical tourists go to the US, Canada, Great Britain, Western Europe, Australia, and the Middle East. Here and even in the developing countries, India being the best example, medical tourists are able to get transplants, dental surgery, rare and cheaper medications, more affordable insurance coverage, and procedures not allowed or unavailable in their countries (Stolley and Watson 2012: 10). India is the most sought-after destination, since medical establishments there are viewed as technologically advanced and cheaper, and perform the most sophisticated operations with little interference from the government. However, despite the increase in the search for treatment abroad, the medical tourist movement raises several questions since it is an intrinsic part of globalization. The questions most relevant refer to its impact on the poor in the receiving countries and on the fact that, in the end, medical tourism favors the rich from the originating countries who are able to fly or drive and pay for the treatment sought. Such conditions would, therefore, tend to increase the world\u2019s inequalities and health disparities. In addition, possibly problematic is the impact of this type of globalization on the local culture and the issues of privacy, liability, and ethics in health.",

These include: Who is actually travelling and how many and where are they going? What is actually the purpose of the trip, that is, what is the nature of the disease, physical, or mental disorder? How successful have the clinical treatments been over the years? Have there been any follow-ups on adherence, resulting complications, \u201clapses of safety,\u201d side effects, infections? What is the quality of the health care provided? All these questions need further assessment and interdisciplinary studies. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to gather data to evaluate this fast growing health industry, since most of the journeys and treatments are private. More questions: What have been the costs associated with it, which governments and health care institutions both in the originating and receiving countries benefit or lose? Does medical tourism increase the quality of domestic health care? Does it tend to increase or decrease access to health to the poor on both ends? Is the phenomenon contributing to the diffusion of new technology for all or just for the rich? Is there much regard for medical ethics? Does this movement contribute to the commercialization of medicine? How does one take it seriously when medical \u201cmiracles\u201d are being touted by both the patient and the receiving medical institution and the country? Can medical tourism be monitored, assessed, and evaluated for quality of product out of the information provided by the patients or intermediaries? Who insures and how are the medical tourists insured, and is there a major insurer in case things go wrong? Only time will provide the answers to these questions. Yet, if medical tourism is to become the health care business of the future, governments and health systems throughout the globe must be concerned and establish clear guidelines that are internationally approved (see Lunt and Mannion 2014: 155\u2013157). The answers are not yet known but they are important, especially when the international community, except the US, believes that health is the right of all people.",

The issue of low physicians\u2019 salary has often created a major friction between the medical associations and the government on the continent, as medical doctors argue that they are often on call 24 hours a day but are paid as low as $250\u2013$600 a month like the other civil servants who may have never gone to school in the first place. The problem is that they compare their salaries to those of their colleagues in the West as noted earlier, forgetting, in the process, that they entered the profession well aware of the compensation system, and that most were entirely sponsored by the government for the completion of their degrees.

They demanded that their pay be raised from $620 to $2200 a month, plus allowances and bonuses. The impact of the strike was devastating\u2014as told by Dar-es-Salaam newspapers. Unfortunately, no study has been conducted to ascertain how many patients may have died as a result of the strike, especially in Dar-es-Salaam. Obviously, the issue of doctors\u2019 strikes has ethical and moral implications, since they have sworn to faithfully uphold the Hippocratic Oath, while the state upholds the view that health is a right of all citizens. Furthermore, strikes contribute indirectly to death and cause unnecessary pain to patients. If the strike is just for salary increases, when the state believes that doctors are paid on a scale equal or even higher compared to most salaried civil service employees, then it is easy to side with the sick, who know that most of the doctors their received their degree through the use of taxpayers\u2019 money. People therefore do not understand why the strikes are allowed to take place. If these are held to improve the quality of health services, renovating buildings, guaranteeing hot water, electricity, sanitation and hygiene, and adequate functioning equipment, then one might understand the situation. But strikes like these must constitute the last resort and be reasonable in their demands. No other civil servants strike to demand that their pay be tripled or quadrupled! It stands to reason, therefore, that there must be an overwhelming reason to prove that, without a lethal strike, there is no other way to improve the situation and that, without a strike, the state would not respond.",

This is unrealistic as private clinics are few and are much more expensive than government hospitals and health clinics\u2014the reason why citizens, except family members, never side with the striking physicians, who are seen by many as acting selfishly as guilds or unions that must get their demands at all cost. As one commentator put it, \u201cBefore the strike, doctors must exhaust all possible alternatives to avoid the strike, and strikes should only be undertaken if it is the only option available. Mass awareness campaigns on the service delivery framework are necessary during the doctor-government negotiation phase to avoid grave negativism from the public, should the strike be the only option to influence the government.\u201d At any rate, continues the commentator of the Tanzanian 2012 doctors\u2019 strike, \u201cboth parties involved in the strike must ensure the continuity of health services to preserve the individual right to (quality) health service\u201d (Singular 2012: 7). This seems to be one element that has been missing in all doctors\u2019 strikes in Africa. As a result, it is the innocent, powerless patients who end up being hurt. A slow down may be acceptable but not a total halt to services to the people whose health the physicians have sworn to protect day and night.

This push for an environment that does not constitute a direct or indirect cause of certain diseases, such as respiratory ailments and cancers, has been accepted by Africans, at least in theory. In fact, when one travels across the continent and sees the prevailing polluted conditions in the cities, the roads, and the villages, one easily gets the impression that the leaders are sleeping behind the wheel. While smoke plagues the cities of Africa from East to West and North to South, there seem to be no regulations on harmful gas emissions from vehicles, trucks, in particular, and motorcycles, and water and soil contaminated by chemical and industrial waste, some of which can be seen oozing above the ground and in the waters people rely on for survival. While Kenyans have seen, on their own, the need to wear smoke hoods in the city of Nairobi to protect their health from polluters, the state simply looks on at the environmental degradation. Lead is generously used in gasoline and other materials, as if scientific warnings about the hazards this metal poses to children in particular mean nothing.

Furthermore, food safety, especially for items cooked along the dusty streets and in the stands of city markets almost all over Sub-Saharan Africa, should constitute a major concern for the authorities. Yet, only a few countries are making an effort to inspect the markets at some point in the food chain. The dangers of contamination and toxicity are real under such circumstances. For example, insufficiently prepared cassava (or manioc) is known to cause paralysis. Yet, cassava is a major food staple in parts of Africa that is not inspected. In Kenya, ingestion of contaminated corn (maize) killed 125 out of 317 reported cases in 2004. It was apparently caused by an infectious disease locally called konzo. Finally, we might note that 72% of the people in Sub-Saharan Africa do not have waste disposal facilities (WHO, African Region Health Report\n2013), which is a serious health hazard. Luckily, Botswana, Ghana, and Tanzania are in the forefront among nations in Africa that plan to adopt a policy of hazard analysis of critical food control points (HACP), an internationally accepted system of food safety management. Food safety measures that apply to items sold in the streets and open markets and others being slowly introduced in Botswana, Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Congo, and Guinea-Bissau are an encouraging sign designed to protect the public. As the WHO notes, \u201cHygiene arrangements among vendors of cheap ready-to-eat food are often very poor in most developing countries. Adequate running water, toilets and washing facilities are rare, many vendors fail to disinfect surfaces or wash their hands, food is not usually protected from insects, and refrigeration is seldom available,\u201d all of which facilitate the transmission of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., hepatitis A virus, and Escherichia coli (African\nRegion Health Report\n2013: 90).1\n",

Indeed, without data, hypotheses, and experimentation there will be no better health in the long-term, and the continent will be forever dependent on Western researchers, even if they collaborate with them, as they will remain appendages in the process and embrace already-formulated theories and practices that fit the foreign researchers\u2019 culture and needs.

We reproduce below the figures on oil and gas production in 19 African countries provided by the US Department of Energy, and EY estimates for 2010. The figures refute the excuses presented, especially if they are considered along with other resources Africa has to offer. Six or seven countries are the largest owners and producers of oil in Africa\u2014Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Algeria, Angola (oil), Sudan (oil), and Egypt (gas), but the prospects for a bright economic future that end or reduce poverty by half in such countries as Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Mali, and Kenya, where oil fields have been found or are suspected to exist, are not promising.

Shepard writes that: \u201cSound legislation and Ugandan specific frameworks are futile unless corruption is curtailed and there is a transparent public involvement,\u201d inclusive of civil society, in the management of future resource revenues. Otherwise, waste, corruption, and environmental catastrophe, may ruin the chances of a bright future that could benefit the health of Uganda\u2019s people. Currently, 22 countries in Africa are known to have oil reserves, including Uganda, Kenya, and Mozambique. Yet, as the Daily Graph shows, \u201coil has been a headache for most African countries and poor governance, consistent corruption, oil revenue going into private accounts outside their respective countries, coupled with major environmental damage and rampant poverty have all caused fractures in these countries\u201d (USEIA 2013). In the case of Equatorial Guinea, which pumps 322,000 barrels a day, oil production accounts for 90% of its revenue and 98% of exports resulting in GDP per capita of $19,000. These conditions are only comparable to the oil potential boom in South Sudan but complicated by political unrest. Yet, more than 60% of Equatoguineans, as is the case in Angola, live on $1.00 a day. The oil in Angola has resulted in a double-digit growth of the GDP, as the oil companies are pumping 1.9 million barrels a day. But, here, too, the benefits do not reach most of the populace, in a continent that is expected to experience a strong economic growth over the next few years. In fact, the World Bank has predicted that \u201cAfrica will grow at its pre-crisis rate of 5% over the period 2013\u20132015 (4.9% in 2013, gradually strengthening to 5.2% in 2015).\u201d Naturally, the fall in oil prices that started in 2015 will negatively impact the rosy predictions. The generated funds could jumpstart Africa and enable it to feed its people, take care of their health and educational needs, and engage in a massive infrastructure build up. The chances of this to happen, however, are slim, if the disappointing past experience under the second generation of African leadership is an indication.",

The University of Minnesota Medical School, which is affiliated with Makerere University\u2019s Mulago Medical School, offers this ominous information and advice to its students going for practice or as interns at the oldest and best Ugandan medical school:As you can see [in the pediatric wards], the beds are right next to each other. Families sleep on the ground in between the beds. Children sometimes have to share a bed, particularly if they need oxygen. On the wards, expect to see very sick patients along with massive teams of medical students, interns, residents, and staff rounding the bedside in a hierarchal structure similar to what you would see in the United States. Rounds typically last several hours; a typical medicine team may care for as many as 70 patients concurrently; pediatric teams often care for even larger teams. You can expect to see some amazing pathology and physical findings, but given the patient load staff rarely have significant time to spend teaching students and residents. The lack of diagnostic resources can also be frustrating at times, as can language barriers\u2026The hospital has suffered significant budget reductions and staff shortages for the last several years, however, and many Ugandans now view the hospital as a place of last resort for poor patients lacking other options, or for those requiring very specialized services [even though, this is the hospital where the President gets his check-ups and treatment].

The issue of alcoholism and drug abuse in Africa and elsewhere is often controversial because, whoever writes about it consciously or unconsciously views it from the religious, social, political, economic, psychosomatic, and physiological angle. This makes it difficult to present an argument defending or condemning it completely, that is, one that is acceptable to all. Ironically, colonial administrators and concessionaire companies tended to consider Africans to be intrinsically uncontrollable intoxicated people, while they themselves spent their evenings indulging in hard whisky, cognac, wine, or beer and losing control over their own actions and words. Dancing at times for hours in their kaki short pants, white hats, long socks, or white trousers in the evening, they would wake up the next day or after the daily afternoon siesta with hangovers just before going to the office if they felt like going to work at all.",

Most importantly, much of the drinking did not result in quarrels and violence as they claimed. If any, most of the violence was verbal rather than physical. Excessive drinking was always condemned. Invariably, also, the colonizers disregarded the fact that drinking was often a visible expression of the misery caused by the colonial system, conveniently forgetting that the production of alcohol was one of the few sources of cash that would allow them to pay taxes the colonial government had imposed on them. For others, such as the poor, it was the only way to enjoy some of the easy pleasures of life and forget, at least for a fleeting moment, their destitute condition. The same phenomenon was observed during the 1980s as a result of the global economic down turn. Bryceson reminds us that, \u201cAlcoholically joyful, creative exchanges have been described as \u2018poor man\u2019s opera\u2019 for those who do not have the financial means to procure more expensive aesthetic experiences or exhilarating pastimes\u201d (2002: 7). Some of the factors that enhanced the drinking of alcohol, say the experts, was and still is, in Africa, the attractive packaging and the slick advertisement of the bottles by the big corporations or mass beer brewers. Despite the abundance of colonial alcoholic beverages, Africans never stopped drinking their own traditional alcoholic creations while gladly embracing the imported new varieties, such as gin and rum. This was true both during the colonial period and in post-independence Africa. As one colonial administrator accurately put it, \u201cYet to some colonial commentators there was too much consumer choice: The African has his palm wine and corn beer. To him spirituous liquor is a superfluous and dangerous luxury. He does not want it; he needs it no more than a cat needs two tails\u201d (Heap 2002: 140).",

The popularity of strong alcoholic beverages was made the easier as Africans had become very adept in fermenting their own products at home. Thus, Sunday rest, funeral occasions, social gatherings, and the heavy advertising by companies have made whiskey, wine, even vodka, beer, gin, and other spirits popular with African males, particularly among those with enviable jobs, including many civil servants, presidents, and university professors. Perhaps with some exaggeration, one health clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe, reported during the early 2000s that \u201c66% of men and 48% of women attending ritual ceremonies, communal planting, and harvesting, and spirit media celebrations\u201d were inebriated during each function.",

It appears that, as a result of the prohibition of its use by minors, tobacco smoking among the young is declining. Thus, while in 1999, 18.5% of the youth revealed they had been smoking before the age of 10, by 2002, the number had been reduced to 16.2%, if one believes the figures. Governments have used higher taxation on tobacco use to reduce smoking, while banning advertisement of cigarettes to minors and educating people on the perils to their health. Of course, to the chronic diseases death toll in Africa must be added the number of casualties and injuries caused by vehicles and motorcycles, as noted above. It is predicted that vehicular mortality, which now ranks as number 10 among the continent\u2019s deadly public health threats, will be among the top three causes of death and injury\u2014and accidents are also associated with infections and disabilities that cripple the patient or the victim of a crash (Cooke 2009: 3).

Besides dying from unprecedented vehicular crashes on the roads, 85% of the deadly world crashes occur in Africa. Many Africans, particularly the poor, as studies in South Africa have demonstrated, die daily from falls, fires, drowning, collapsing structures, seasonal flooding, intermittent droughts that result in famines, pipe accidents and explosions at refineries, as has been the case in Nigeria, volcanoes when they erupt, gas emissions from gasoline refineries spewing toxins in the air, and earthquakes.

Usually, an infectious disease is acute, sudden, and symptomatic, even though it can also be chronic, such as HIV, and therefore taking longer to manifest itself in the host. A major outbreak of an endemic disease becomes epidemic when it reaches unusual proportions in terms of spread and impact, affecting individuals in a given population and a certain geographic location more severely than ever before, or pandemic when it affects communities throughout the world, as has been the case with HIV/AIDS, H1N1, SARS, and the Spanish Influenza of 1918\u20131919. If deadly, pandemics tend to decimate millions of people worldwide. While some infectious diseases, such as malaria, can be deadly, others, like polio, can leave the victim disabled or paralyzed, blind, physically and intellectually stunted, or it may simply incapacitate the host to the extent that he or she is unable to function as a normal human being.",

Rodents are responsible for the terrible plagues that have hit the world, including Africa, as discussed in this work. However, recent progress against infectious diseases has been so dramatic that a US Surgeon-General declared in the late 1970s that infectious diseases were a thing of the past and urged the world to tackle chronic diseases, instead.

Malaria is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito, which breeds all year round in hot and humid climate, and is common to most swampy areas of the continent; leishmaniasis is transmitted by sand flies living in scrubland; whereas river blindness is transmitted by black flies that thrive in fast river currents. The tsetse fly carries parasites that cause sleeping sickness, while ordinary flies are causes of an eye disease called trachoma. River snails penetrate the human skin in snail infested water and are responsible for a debilitating disease called bilharziasis or schistosomiasis, and children and women are most vulnerable to it as they tend to be more often in contact with rivers, lakes, and streams. Schistosomiasis affects mostly children, as noted, and is not deadly, but adversely impacts \u201cthe quality of life of adults, and infects 160 million people in Africa annually contributing to anemia among pregnant women\u201d (39). Since it affects mostly children, ages 5\u201314 years, studies have shown that \u201cheavy infestations may impair the cognitive function of these children\u201d (WHO, African Region Health Report\n2013: 39). Rabies, which cannot be transmitted from human to human, comes from mad dogs, cats, and bats, and is deadly.",

In African urban areas, in particular, hepatitis, typhoid, and diarrhea, occur quite often. Cholera, bacillary dysentery, and worm diseases are caused by roundworms, hookworms, and tapeworms, or helminths, which are soil-transmitted to humans. Neglected infectious diseases contribute to severe pain, suffering, and lifelong disabilities and are responsible for enormous loss of individual and household productivity, businesses slowdown, and lowering a country\u2019s economic output, such as the GDP. Despite the ubiquitous nature of the parasitic worms, they have been reduced by 96% globally since 1986. However, most of the remaining cases occur in 13 African countries, in which the final phase of its eradication has proven difficult. Leprosy is another infectious disease that has almost been eradicated globally, except in Africa, where 96% of the cases were contained 20 years ago, but the remaining 4% have been extremely problematic and resilient. Currently, at least seven African countries are struggling with the incidence of leprosy, where the global goal was to reduce it to one case per 1000 people by 2003. Nigeria is one of the countries that, along with Botswana, Mali, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, Zambia, Niger, and Tanzania, seems to have achieved the goal but the stigma of leprosy is still strong here. In Mozambique, the prevalence rate for leprosy was 127,500 in 1991, but the number was reduced to 51,200 or 60% by 2003, with 800,000 cases been cured through use of effective drugs. Fortunately, physicians have reported that it is not drug-resistant in endemic environments such as CAR, Tanzania, Angola, Mozambique, and Madagascar, where it is endemic but it has almost been eradicated (WHO, African Region Health Report\n2013: 42).",

Mental health is simply a disaster of epidemic proportions in Sub-Saharan Africa as alluded to in this chapter. The UN Population Program notes that, of the 800 million living in Sub-Saharan Africa during the first decade of the twenty-first century, 50% suffer from one form or another of handicap but only 2% receive specific rehabilitation care. Also, 90% of children with mental health disorders die before the age of five, and the majority of the affected are the poor people and the unemployed (Niang 2008: 11). Unfortunately, researchers have not shown much interest in the problem of mental health on the continent.

The issue of the origins of HIV/AIDS is still being debated today, more than three decades after its discovery during the 1980s. A theory advanced and published in the Journal of Science in 2006 attributes the origins to Southeastern Cameroon, the result of a team study led by Professor Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Dr. Paul Sharp from the University of Edinburgh. The project\u2019s aim was to search for the simian virus in chimpanzees feces collected \u201cacross a vast swath of Southeastern Cameroon.\u201d The team traced the carrier to an African porter employed by the French sometime between 1890 and 1900 or thereabouts. The researchers claimed that one hungry man went hunting and killed a blood infected chimpanzee. The blood subsequently infected the hunter, \u201cprobably through a cut during butchering.\u201d This tragedy occurred \u201camid massive infusion of new people and technology into a land where ancient ways still prevailed,\u201d as the \u201c\u2026European powers engaged in a feverish race for wealth and glory in blazed routes up muddy rivers and into dense forests that had been travelled only sporadically by humans before\u201d (Timberg and Halperin 2012: 1\u20133).",

This was \u201ca lightly developed southern region where relatively few people live even today, scientists say.\u201d The study\u2019 conclusions seemed to confirm what many scientists had known or speculated before, namely, that a blood sample from 1959 indicated that Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC, had been the virus habitat many decades prior to its discovery during the 1980s. In 2008, Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist working in a laboratory at the University of Arizona, published his own findings in the journal Nature after discovering a second sample of the virus \u201ctrapped in a wax-encased lymph node biopsy from 1960.\u201d He compared the genetic structure of the two samples and concluded that the HIV-1 group M was much older than thought at the time. He was convinced that he had proven that both samples had come from the same ancestor, sometime between 1884 and 1924. However, the most probable year seems to be 1908. The HIV-1 group M is said to have been hatched somewhere along the banks of Sangha River, which flows toward Central Africa, an area where Kinshasa is also located. Timberg and Halperin add that \u201cthis section of the Sangha was not ideal for navigation because of its ribbons of sandbars and the dense vegetation along the banks\u201d (Timberg and Halperin 2012: 2), the reason why the virus did not spread as fast. This international team had set up 10 stations spread over a wide portion of Southeastern Cameroon, and found the HIV-1 group M virus samples in two of the stations, which were completely remote from any population, and were almost a perfect match of the HIV-1 Group M, whose impact has been, since the 1980s, so devastating to mankind.",

As argued in this volume, the cohabitation of animals, including chimpanzees, and men goes back centuries, and it appears that West Africa was aware that the big apes could transmit the disease to men, even prior to the most recent outbreaks. During the 1990s, hunters in the region are also said to have been aware of the disease, and recognized the phenomenon from the new outbreak but were not convinced that Ebola had come from the chimps. In other areas, such as Gabon, people were not only aware of the disease but knew that chimps could also suffer from it just as man could. Thus, in their minds, the disease could come from either man or chimp. This a plausible reason why the epidemic broke out in Gabon in 1997, hunters had detailed knowledge of the index case\u2014a hunter who had found a dead gorilla in the forest and had brought it back to his village to share with others\u201d (Giles-Vernick and Rupp 2013: 128\u2013130).",

However, unlike the developing world, 85% of it is not treated here. Epilepsy goes virtually untreated in Africa, whereas, in the industrialized world, the treatment rate is 80%. Unfortunately, again, very little research has been done on these disorders in Africa. The African sub-continent has virtually no mental health programs worth mentioning and no facilities that would pass a rigorous test, even though Ghana is planning to introduce a robust program in the near future. Until now, Sudan and South Sudan, for example, have not had a single psychiatry training institution or psychiatrists at work.

Restriction of hours at nights when buses can run, the use of helmets for motorcycles, laws on seat belt use, limitation in alcohol consumption for drivers, clear road signs, speed limits enforcement, and rumble strips have decreased the number of fatalities in many African cities and highways. Ghana is a good example where lives have being saved. Ghana\u2019s fatalities per 10,000 vehicles were about 30\u201340 times higher than those in countries with higher incomes.

In Uganda, where motorcycles are used as taxis called boda boda, carrying at times four people, including children and women, crashes kill and incapacitate hundreds of passengers annually. Some doctors claim that 60% of the serious injuries and surgeries are a result of improper and dangerous motorcycle use caused by overcrowding in a small seat and the absence of laws calling for helmet wearing. Unfortunately, virtually anyone can operate a motorcycle without a license, even though this is prohibited by law, and they frequently crash with cars. Often, law enforcement agents simply look the other way and refuse to enforce the law.

Indeed, as Omar Massoud writes of Nigeria, for the problems of slums, lack of access to basic services such as housing, clean water, primary health care, sanitation, and essential drugs, Africans must enact policies specifically aimed at reducing \u201ccorruption through community driven checks and balances which ensure effective citizen participation.\u201d Yet, \u201cthe local governments should have [as well] the skilled manpower to deal with the problems of urbanization\u201d (2013: 1). Consequently, African leaders and their ministries of health have a major task to perform: Use resources to ensure people are able to feed themselves, provide equal opportunities for all citizens to attain education, make the health of the people one of the top priorities, develop agriculture, improve the physical and social infrastructure, and adopt transparency in every major transaction, end political and economic corruption, and embrace democratic governance. Short of any of these goals, the future of health on the continent will continue to experience insolvable problems that will make Africa the world\u2019s laughing stock.",
