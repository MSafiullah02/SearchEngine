COVID-19 is known to cause lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, does it cause overweight or obesity? Is it dangerous to be obese and get Overweight and obesity are defined as excessive fat accumulation, so they represent a risk to health. Most of the world's populations live in countries where overweight and obesity kill more people than underweight. But will the world notice an increase in obesity during this era of the COVID-19 epidemic?",

All governments that got COVID-19 in their countries have started a curfew until further notice. This leads to a change in lifestyle and a decrease in exercise practice in their populations. So, in addition to work stops, the people in these countries stopped working and going to gyms or parks to do exercise or even doing at home.

Low levels of immunity are not accepted in defending a new virus-like COVID-19. It's noticed that in 50% of patients with COVID-19 are associated with hypercytokinemia. Severe cases tend to have lymphopenia; especially T cells, leucocytosis and increase in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Inflammatory cytokines were also elevated in severe cases, including IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1. The overproduction of those proinflammatory cytokines results in what has been described as a cytokine storm, leading to an increased risk of vascular hyperpermeability and multiorgan failure with COVID-19 (Jose and Manuel, 2020) .",
