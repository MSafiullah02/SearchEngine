The stands were arranged in a single-dimensioned ordination on the basis of the importance values of the persistent species in the overstories. Leading dominant species, from the \"dry\" end to the \"wet\" end of the ordination gradient, were Cornus florida, Pinus palustris, Quercus nigra, Liquidambar styracifiua, Nyssa sylvatica v. sylvatica, Magnolia virginiana, and N. sylvatica v. bifiora. Two important sera! species, most prominent at the middle of the ordination gradient and of relatively little importance at either end, were Pinus elliottii and Liriodendro'n tulipifera. The stand position on the ordination gradient, referred to as the moisture-regime index, was significantly related to water-table depth, soil-surface gradient, and soil pH at 63.5 em. Failure to obtain significant relationship with other soil variables was attributed to the high frequency of fresh soil deposition in the small stream bottoms. As a check on the ordination analysis, species-presence data were used to construct a species-correlation diagram. When species moisture-regime numbers from the ordination analysis were inserted in this diagram, good agreement was revealed in the results of the two independent analyses.",

            "text": "In southern Alabama, \"branch-bottoms\" are recognized as consisting of the wet alluvial and colluvial areas along small intermittent or perennial streams. The vegetation and the habitat of these areas differ from those of both the uplands and the larger flood plains. Although individual branch-bottoms are narrow, irregular, and small, Croker ( 1963) estimates that they cover about one-fifth of the total longleaf pine area in southern Alabama and probably account for a third of its total productive capacity. In spite of the high frequency and large total area of the southern branchbottoms, scientists have neglected them in the past. Increased markets for the trees in these areas, resulting primarily from increased utilization of hardwoods for pulpwood, have caused more attention to be focused on them. In addition, branchbottom areas offer possibilities of almost ideal habitat conditions for deer, wild turkey, squirrel, and other game species. In the interest of sound ecological management in the branch-bottoms, a better knowledge of the specific plant communities and habitats is needed.",

In a study of wetter hardwood sites in north-central Florida, Monk ( 1966) described \"mixed swamps\" and \"bayheads\" as occurring along creeks, rivers, sloughs, and depressions where seasonal flooding is common. Mixed swamps, he found, may be dominated by Fra.xinus caroliniana, Acer rubrum, Nyssa sylvatica ( Wells (1928 Wells ( , 1942 , Pessin (1933) , Harper (1943) , Braun (1950) , Penfound (1952) , and Putnam, Furnival, and McKnight (1960) . Wells' ( 1942) climax vegetation of \"meso-hydric\" sites of the Southeast might well encompass the branch-bottom vegetation of this report. Putnam eta!. (1%0) recognized a category of \"other lowland hardwood sites\" for the Southeast that would definitely include the branch-bottoms. In her classification of the deciduous forests of eastern North America, Braun ( 1950) apparently included the branch-bottoms of the southeastern coastal plain in her statement that \"pine and sweet bay flats, with their dense tangle of shrubs and lianas, interrupt the longleaf pine woods.\" THE STUDY AREA",

The area is characterized by flat to rolling topography. The climate of the study area is characterized by abundant precipitation in all seasons and moderate to high temperatures throughout the year (U. S. Department of Agriculture Weather Bureau 1930 , Long 1964 . Average annual precipitation is between 60 and 65 inches ( 152 and 165 em). The average \"frost- free\" season at Brewton is 231 days (U. S. Department of Agriculture 1941). The recent alluvial and colluvial material in the branch-bottoms is most commonly classified in the Baldwin County soil survey as \"wet loamy alluvial lands\" (McBride and Burgess 1964) . Soils are described as saturated most of the time and gray to black in the upper part, depending on the amount of organic matter, and gray, black, or mottled in the lower part. The exposed geologic material outside the branch-bottoms is mainly of Pliocene origin and consists predominantly of marine sands and gravels (Adams et al. 1926) . The soils developed from these are, of course, generally sandy in texture. In addition, older Miocene material, consisting predominantly of marine clays, is exposed along the lower sides of the deeper valleys where the soils tend to be \"heavy\" or clayey in texture.",

However, since there were 62 understory species enumerated in the quadrats, mean moisture-regime-index values are presented in the interest of saving space. A mean weighted moistureregime index was calculated for each species by taking the sum of products of the importance value times moisture-regime index per plot and then dividing by the sum of the importance values of that species in all plots. The mean weighted moisture-regime-index values are shown for the understory species in Table 4 . Several given species occupy widely different relative positions along the moisture-regime index in the understory as compared to the overstory. This is largely a result of variability caused by low numbers of occurrences of the species in either of the two layers. With high numbers of occurrences for a species in both layers, and assuming that species are similarly distributed in both layers, a Soils and topography as related to the leading dominant analysis In general, plots with moisture-regime indices between 300 and 800 are typically of the relatively well-drained Ochlockonee, Congaree, and Ducker soils. From 800 to 1,100, the moderately welldrained Iuka and the somewhat poorly drained Mantachie are most common. Poorly drained Bibb is most common between 1,100 and 1,SOO. Above 1,SOO, the poorly drained Bibb, Chastain, and Johnston prevail. Thus, the drainage classification of the soil types follows the moisture-regime index quite well.",

Culling out of slash pine and yellow-poplar in the lower moisture-regime indices has resulted in their decline, whereas at the higher indices they are evidently limited by the habitat. Heavy cutting and logging, the provision for seed sources (or planting) , and perhaps the supplementary use of herbicides on the competing species are indicated for the drier and medium moisture-regime indices; it will be difficult and costly to do much of anything on the wettest sites of the highest indices. However, if the slash pine is already the dominant species on one of these wet sites, it may be feasible to reduce the hardwoods with cutting and herbicides to the point where they can be further controlled and excluded through periodic burning, utilizing the pine litter as the major fuel. The junior author has observed the successful use of fire in this way in slash pine on Myatt soil, at about the Magnolia virginiama portion of the ordination gradient, in northern Baldwin County.",

Clark and Boyce ( 1964) found in Indiana that viable yellow-poplar seed remains stored for several years in the litter and duff of undisturbed stands, ready to germinate under conditions normally associated with cutting and logging. In line with this finding, Merz and Boyce (1958) , Sander (1966) , and others have found that the more complete the cutting and logging, the more prolific and vigorous the yellowpoplar seedling reproduction. Although the branch-bottoms of southern Alabama are far removed from the locales of the studies cited, it seems reasonable nevertheless to at least hypothesize similar habits of the native yellow-poplar. This would indicate the desirability of thorough clear-cutting to maximize reproduction of the species. Follow-up cultural work might be necessary to ensure that the yellow-poplar seedlings are not submerged by the growth of neighboring sprouts.",
