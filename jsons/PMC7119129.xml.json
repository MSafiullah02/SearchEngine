            "text": "With the completion of various genome sequencing projects, functional analysis of gene products has taken the stage. Gene fusion technology has an important role in many aspects of gene function studies, including gene and protein tagging, reporter gene studies, domain swapping studies, mutagenesis studies and gene knock-in and/or knock-out experiments [1]. Classic gene fusion techniques involving type II restriction enzyme digestion and DNA ligation reactions (the so-called cut-and-paste reactions) have been used as standard procedures for generating hybrid genes. However, such procedures often leave behind operational sequences, such as restriction sites, at the junction. These unwanted sequences can change the spacing between the DNA elements and introduce extra amino acid residues at the junction, which could have undesired effects on the structure and activity of the fusion protein and could therefore interfere with accurate study of the fusion gene. This review discusses examples in which the use of precisely fused genes is required or desired and outlines approaches that can be used to achieve seamless gene fusion. Owing to the lack of reviews in this area some historical information together with recent advances will be discussed here.",

            "text": "Gene promoters contain arrays of regulatory elements to which transcriptional factors bind and interact with each other to regulate transcription. Promoter deletion analysis allows identification of these functional elements and provides crucial information on the mechanism of gene regulation. However, because spacing between various regulatory elements is often important, a linker of the same length is usually required to preserve the spacing and helical facing of the elements. Linker scanning analysis [2] (Box 1\n, Case 1) of gene promoters requires seamless DNA fusion or sequence replacement. Molecular evolution approaches, such as exon and DNA shuffling, for producing proteins with desired biochemical and/or biophysical properties also require seamless splicing of various functional elements [3]. In eukaryotic cells, chimeric genes and/or proteins can be created by intron-mediated RNA splicing 4, 5. In these experiments synthesis of RNA substrates and/or exon-tagged ribozymes requires careful design and generation of the chimeric precursor genes. As long as the hybrid gene is generated correctly, seamless fusion can be achieved on splicing.Box 1Seamless gene fusion case studies\nCase 1. Scanning mutagenesis. Scanning mutagenesis experiments were designed to identify cis regulatory elements in gene promoters [2] or to study crucial amino acid residue(s) in protein structure and function. For a gene promoter, a linker scanning analysis is performed. A panel of DNA constructs is made and within each a segment of the promoter is replaced by a defined linker fragment of the same length to restore the spacing. For a protein, alanine scanning mutagenesis is often performed [65] in which a set of mutants are generated with each charged amino acid residue mutated to alanine. Traditionally, scanning mutagenesis constructs were generated by a laborious process involving the use of exonucleases, linkers and ligase [2] or by bacterial phage M13-based site-directed mutagenesis [20]. With the advent of PCR, the variant constructs can be easily generated by overlap PCR [66] or in vivo recombination 57, 58.\nCase 2. The ubiquitin tagging system and applications. Ubiquitin is a highly conserved eukaryotic protein of 76 amino acid residues that is naturally expressed as polyubiquitin, which is then cleaved precisely in vivo at the C-terminus of the ubiquitin moiety by a family of ubiquitin processing proteases (Ubps). The amino acid residue at P1\u2032 could be any residue except proline. The high specificity and the unique cleavage fashion of Ubps have made the ubiquitin\u2013Ubp pair an ideal tagging system for gene expression in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells [67]. To study the impact of the N-terminal amino acid residue on stability of proteins in yeast, Varshavsky and colleagues 21, 22 created a set of ubiquitin\u2013X\u2013\u03b2gal seamless fusion genes, in which X is a codon for one of the 20 amino acids. Upon expression in yeast, the nascent fusion proteins are de-ubiquitinated by Ubps in vivo, exposing the X\u2013\u03b2gal proteins with various N-terminal residues. Stability studies of these X\u2013\u03b2gal proteins in yeast led to the discovery of the N-end rule of protein stability in vivo\n[68]. Co-translational processing has also allowed protein production in eukaryotic cells 67, 69. In prokaryotic cells, ubiquitin fusion proteins are not processed in vivo owing to the lack of Ubps. After purification of the fusion protein, the ubiquitin tag can be removed with a purified Ubp in vitro\n[15]. Along the same line, the yeast small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein, SMT3, has been used as a fusion tag for protein production in E. coli\n[14] (http://lifesensors.com/r_and_d/protein_expression.php3). This tag can be removed by treating with SUMO hydrolase (ubiquitin-like protease 1) in vitro. The ubiquitin\u2013Ubp proteins thus provide a unique system for producing proteins with an authentic N-terminus, as long as the ubiquitin-ORF fusion is generated seamlessly.\nCase 3. Viral genome assembly. In an effort to assemble a 31.5 kb full length infectious cDNA of a recombinant coronavirus, Yount and colleagues used a seamless gene fusion approach involving PCR and the use of a type IIS restriction enzyme [19]. To do so, the viral genome was PCR amplified as seven neighboring fragments using primers with an Esp3I cleavage site engineered at the ends. Esp3I digestion removes any unwanted nucleotide residues at the ends of the PCR fragments, leaving specific four base overhangs that are complementary for the neighboring segments. A stepwise ligation reaction allowed directional assembly of the full-length viral genome.",

To elucidate the function of a particular domain in a defined protein, mutant proteins with the domain deleted or replaced by a similar domain from a homologous protein are often needed. Such a domain deletion or swapping experiment would benefit greatly from seamless fusions of the relevant parts to eliminate potential negative effects caused by the presence of operational sequences. In more general terms, seamless fusions of various domains are essential for protein engineering, including the generation of novel hybrid molecules and antibody engineering. In the case of antibody engineering, grafting of the complementarity-determining region (CDR) from mouse antibodies to human frameworks (CDR-grafting) and site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) are routine procedures [6]. Chimeric proteins can also be generated via intein-mediated protein splicing and ligation [7]. As long as the intein-containing precursor proteins are generated seamlessly, precise protein fusions can be achieved.",

They confer solubility and stability and facilitate subsequent affinity purification of the target protein [1]. In cases in which the activity of a particular protein is unaffected by the presence of its fusion partner or a tag, the entire fusion protein is used in subsequent applications. This is often the case for enzymatic studies and assay development. However, in many cases removal of the fusion partner is required or desired and can be achieved via an engineered protease cleavage site. This process requires a seamless junction between the protease cleavage site and the protein of interest. For structural studies, in some cases fusion proteins with a short tag (such as a hexa-Histidine tag) have been successfully crystallized and removal of the tag is unnecessary.

            "text": "In producing mature and active proteins, proteins with native amino acid residues are often required. This is exemplified by proteins such as RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), interleukin-18 (IL-18), IL-1\u03b2 and hirudin 8, 9, 10, 11. Addition of a methionine residue at the N-termini of these proteins significantly reduces activity. In the case of RANTES, Met-RANTES was found to behave as an antagonist for the authentic RANTES [8]. A practical approach for producing proteins with authentic N-terminal residues in E. coli is to express and purify them as fusion proteins with an N-terminal tag. Following purification, and refolding if necessary, the tag and any unwanted amino acid residues are then removed via a specifically engineered protease cleavage site. This process requires a seamless junction between the protease cleavage site and the protein of interest. Enterokinase [12], factor Xa [13] and ubiquitin-specific proteases (Ubps) 14, 15 that cleave at the C-terminal of their recognition sequences are often used for this purpose. The tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease [16] can also be used because it has a relaxed requirement on the amino acid residue immediately following the cleavage site (the P1\u2032 position). The ubiquitin/Ubp system is probably the first tagging system that is used to generate proteins with native N-terminal residues both in vivo and in vitro (Box 1, Case 2). In producing mature human Apo A-I in E. coli, Moguilevsky and colleagues [17] found that the ubiquitin tagging system is one of the most straightforward methods.",

This process often involves deletion of the entire open reading frame (ORF) or a part that encodes a particular domain, and in some cases replacement of these with sequences of a mutant allele or an orthologue. These studies require generation of knockout and knock-in constructs in which all the functional elements, including flanking regions, required for homologous recombination are precisely joined. Seamless gene fusion technologies would greatly facilitate construct generation for such studies.

With the same principle, multiple DNA fragments can be spliced together seamlessly [25] and recombinant fusion genes as long as 20 Kb have been obtained [26]. Overlap PCR has been used to introduce point mutations, insertions, deletions and replacements into any point of a gene in a seamless fashion 23, 24. The PCR generated fusion genes can subsequently be cloned into appropriate vectors for downstream applications. Note that a special case of overlap PCR is gene synthesis, in which overlapping oligonucleotides are used as PCR templates for gene assembly [27]. This approach can be readily used if there is no suitable template DNA that can be used for PCR amplification, and/or if the hybrid gene is relatively short (<500bp).",

A variety of mutagenesis approaches are available for generating point mutations [28]. However, mutagenesis tasks involving deletion, insertion or replacement of a sequence are typically achieved by a PCR-based method. Inverse PCR uses two oppositely positioned primers to amplify a plasmid backbone, which allows generation of point mutations, deletions and insertions at any location of the plasmid [29]. However, the PCR step could potentially introduce sequence errors in the circular plasmid backbone. This issue was addressed by the QuickChange\u2122 (www.stratagene.com) mutagenesis technology 30, 31. As illustrated in Figure 2\n, the method relies on the use of two fully complementary mutagenic primers and Pfu DNA polymerase. Given that the primers are completely complementary to each other, and that Pfu lacks strand-displacement activity, the mutant strands are only linearly amplified from the original template DNA during the multiple thermal cycles. This design thus prevents amplification of any errors that occurred during DNA synthesis. The QuickChange\u2122 procedure and improvements have been used to generate a DNA insertion, deletion or sequence replacement at any site of the template DNA 32, 33 and even to introduce multiple mutations into a template simultaneously [34]. The QuickChange\u2122 mutagenesis kit thus allows easy manipulation of any circular plasmid DNA with high fidelity.",

In cases in which one of the two fragments is a generic one to which multiple partners will be fused, such as a purification tag (e.g. maltose binding protein) for protein production, the fragment is usually inserted into the expression vector first. The vector is then made to accept its fusion partner through seamless cloning 38, 39 (Figure 3b).

Cloning via the type IIS enzyme Eam1104 I allows seamless fusion of the target ORF immediately downstream of the CBP\u2013EK ORF. After expression and purification of the CBP\u2013EK\u2013ORF fusion protein, removal of the CBP\u2013EK polypeptide with enterokinase allows recovery of the target recombinant protein with native amino acid sequence [39].

With its unique properties, LIC has been used to achieve seamless cloning to join ORFs encoding protein domains for protein production 12, 39, 43, 44. Using chimeric PCR primers containing ribonucleotides, LIC ends with cohesive overhangs can also be generated by treating the PCR products with other reagents, such as uracil DNA glycosylase [45] or rare-earth metal ions [46]. Jarrell and colleagues [47] used primers with three consecutive ribonucleotide bases or a single 2\u2032-O-methyl ribonucleotide to terminate DNA synthesis at the complementary strand, thus generating single-stranded overhangs during PCR.

Because the location for homologous recombination can be freely chosen, it allows seamless DNA manipulation. Traditionally, this process is used in allelic replacement for gene function studies in E. coli and yeast cells. This is usually achieved by a two-step homologous recombination process 18, 49. A circular plasmid bearing a positive selectable marker and a negative selectable marker is first incorporated into a specific site of the target ORF on the chromosome or an episomal vector. Recombinants are selected through the positive selection marker. The selection fragment is subsequently replaced with another fragment containing a modified version of the ORF by counter selection against the negative selectable marker. This process allows precise and seamless gene manipulation on chromosome(s). In yeast, manipulation of genes carried on a plasmid is traditionally achieved by a one-step gap repair process, which requires only \u223c30 bp homologous arms [50]. Using PCR technology, the hybrid constructs for such gap repair experiments can easily be generated to achieve deletion, insertion and sequence replacement. A yeast\u2013E. coli\u2013mammalian shuttle vector was used for generating hybrid fusion genes seamlessly in Saccharomyces cerevesiae followed by plasmid rescue in E. coli\n[51].",

            "text": "Homologous recombination in E. coli can be achieved by three different mechanisms: RecA-dependent, RecA-independent and Red/ET-dependent. RecA binds to single-stranded segments of DNA and promotes strand invasion and exchange between homologous sequences. RecA-mediated recombination requires a long homologous region (>1 Kb) and occurs at a low frequency [52]. It has been used to generate recombinant adenoviral genomes [53] and in the two-step allelic replacement experiment to modify genes carried on bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and P1-derived artificial chromosomes (PACs) 54, 55. The RecA-independent pathway works in recA strains and requires the two DNA fragments to be recombined to have >12 bp homologies at the ends 56, 57, 58 (Figure 5\n). Co-transformation of the two linear DNA fragments allows recovery of circular plasmids. However, the exact mechanism for this reaction is unclear and the cloning efficiency can be low. A high cloning efficiency is obtained when the origin of replication and a selectable marker are contained in a separate fragment to enforce recombination 57, 58. This strategy has been used to generate a series of cysteine mutations of a protein in a high-throughput fashion [59]. The Red/ET system only requires 30\u201350 bp homologous regions between a linear vector fragment and a linear insert fragment for efficient recombination in E. coli (Figure 5). The technology relies on the function of the Red\u03b1/Red\u03b2 protein pair that of \u03bb prophage, or their functionally equivalent RecE/RecT protein pair of Rac prophage, in which Red\u03b1 and RecE are 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonucleases and Red\u03b2 and RecT are single-stranded DNA annealing proteins 52, 61. In recBC sbcA mutant strains, the RecBCD exonuclease activity is inactivated and the RedE/RedT proteins are expressed from a cryptic Rac prophage that is activated by the sbcA mutation, homologous recombination between linear fragments is possible 52, 60, 61. In recBC+ strains, homologous recombination between linear fragments can be enabled by over-expressing RedE/RedT proteins and the Red\u03b3 gene product, which inhibits RecBCD exonuclease activity 51, 60\u201d.",

In certain situations in which the presence of additional nucleotides or amino acid residues is unlikely to have a negative impact, making the hybrid construct free of operational sequences can only help assure the perfect design. However, although the presence of the operational sequence might not seem to have an undesired effect for one application of the hybrid molecule (for example in enzymatic assays) it might be problematic for another application, such as crystallization.

For example, vectors for LIC must be free of extra nucleotide residues at the ends. All the methods described rely on the use of PCR to generate the correct ends on the insert and/or the vector fragments to enable seamless gene fusion or cloning. Although PCR fidelity was an issue for long PCRs in the late 1980s, it became less of a concern with the use of high fidelity DNA polymerases, such as Pfu DNA polymerase [62]. The use of high fidelity DNA polymerases or their blends has greatly facilitated the generation of long fusion genes and viral genomes 19, 26. Nevertheless sequencing confirmation of the fusion genes is always required. In addition, because the fusion junctions are free of operational sequences, such as restriction site(s) or site-specific recombination sequences, the fusion gene or part of it cannot be readily transferred to other vectors. This is in strong contrast to those hybrid genes with a seam, in which the DNA components can be transferred to other vectors by the \u2018cut-and-paste\u2019 approach or by site-specific recombination systems, such as the Gateway\u2122 system (www.invitrogen.com) [63] or the Creator\u2122 system [64] (www.bdbiosciences.com). Whenever possible, benefits of both the seamless system and the facile transfer system should be combined. For example, the hybrid gene can be assembled seamlessly first by overlap PCR and then subcloned into a Gateway\u2122 entry vector to facilitate facile transfer of the hybrid ORF to other destination vectors.",

Fragment X is first PCR amplified and purified. The primers are designed so that the 5\u2032-end 12 bases are free of one specific nucleotide (e.g. dT as an example). The product is then treated with a DNA polymerase possessing 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity (such as T4 DNA polymerase and Pfu) in the presence of dATP. The polymerase starts to remove nucleotides from 3\u2032-ends of the fragment until a dA base is encountered and removed, which is subsequently added back by the enzyme's 5\u2032-3\u2032 polymerase activity. This reaction generates 12 base (or longer) overhangs on fragment X. The vector fragment, which contains fragments Y and Z was engineered and prepared similarly to yield 12 base (or longer) overhangs that are complementary to the insert fragment. The plasmid backbone contains an origin of replication (ori) and a selectable marker (sm). The LIC-ready vector fragment and the insert fragment are then annealed to form circular duplexes, which are recovered in E. coli following transformation 39, 42.
