Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of contracting COVID-19, and this risk is mitigated through the use of personal protective equipment such as N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs). The high demand for FFRs is not currently met by global supply chains, potentially placing HCWs at increased exposure risk. Effective FFR decontamination modalities exist, which could maintain respiratory protection for HCWs in the midst of the current pandemic, through the decontamination and re-use of FFRs. Here, we present a locally-implemented ultraviolet-C germicidal irradiation (UVGI)-based FFR decontamination pathway, utilizing a home-built UVGI array assembled entirely with previously existing components available at our institution. We provide recommendations on the construction of similar systems, as well as guidance and strategies towards successful institutional implementation of FFR decontamination.",

Respiratory protection is an important component of interrupting the chain of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs) or equivalent, when available, for care of COVID-19 positive patients [1] . Unfortunately, N95 FFRs are currently in critically short supply due to the intersection of dramatically increased global demand and fractured supply chains. Thus, an urgent need exists for the development of decontamination strategies for used N95 FFRs during this crisis.",

After the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, numerous studies demonstrated that coronaviruses, similar to SARS-CoV-2, are inactivated by light in the UV-C spectrum (200-280nm) [6] . Inactivation occurs by photochemical degradation of the genetic material of coronaviruses, which is composed of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) [10, 11] . Institutions have developed and disseminated streamlined protocols for UVGI-based N95 FFR decontamination [10] , on which our approach was initially based. However, similar to the challenges in acquisition of specialized equipment to implement other decontamination methodologies (e.g., vaporized hydrogen peroxide), commercial UVGI systems have also been difficult or costly to obtain during the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this document, we discuss technical considerations, practical guidance, and alternative approaches to the development of local facilities and methodologies for UVGI-based N95 FFR decontamination.",

However, N95 FFRs are composed of multiple layers of material which are not fully penetrable by that UV-C dose, and contain uneven surfaces that UV-C light may not reach effectively due to shadowing. Thus, the efficacy of UV-C light in killing viruses located on mask material was evaluated independently. The research and engineering firm Applied Research Associates (ARA) performed UV-C validation studies on N95 FFRs using influenza H1N1 virus which, like SARS-CoV-2, is an ssRNA enveloped virus. They demonstrated that the UV-C dose required to reduce H1N1 virus to undetectable levels on N95 FFRs was 1 J/cm 2 [13] . In a separate analysis, UV-C intensity of 1.0-1.2 J/cm 2 also effectively decontaminated a wide variety of N95 FFRs (shapes/models) of H1N1 virus, even when viral inoculations were covered with soiling agents (artificial skin oil or artificial saliva) [5] . However, mask straps were more variably decontaminated at that dose, with several models achieving less than a 3-log reduction in viral load [5, 13] , suggesting that an alternative modality, such as disinfectant wipes, might need to be applied to decontaminate straps of certain mask models.",

Our intent was to provide a strong irradiance with only moderate variation over the region occupied by the N95s directly between the arrays.

This irradiance provides a dosage of 24-42 mJ/cm 2 in one minute, and 1.0-1.4 J/cm 2 in approximately 30 minutes.

The meter provides readings in mW units, which are converted to mW/cm 2 by dividing measurements by detector surface area (0.785 cm 2 ), and to mJ/cm 2 by multiplying by exposure time in seconds. This small handheld meter was best utilized together with the manufacturer's software to display power in graphical format, to zero the detector remotely via a long USB cable, and time average the readings. Time averaging also helped compensate for the sensitivity of this detector to other wavelengths, which caused readings to fluctuate near infrared sources (e.g., a gloved hand) or other field-generating electronics. This second issue could potentially be addressed by adding a shortpass optical filter to the detector array. Other home-designed UVGI measurement solutions utilizing photodiodes have also been evaluated [19] .",

The bulb in our hood was a year-old GE G64T5 65W bulb, with an expected light intensity of 0.26 mW/cm 2 at 1 m distance. We measured an irradiance of 0.18 mW/cm 2 of UV-C intensity at the working surface directly below the bulb (approximately 60 cm away from the bulb) and 0.13 mW/cm 2 at the working surface at the front of the hood (approximately 75 cm away from the bulb). A raised platform one foot from the center of the bulb received 0.34 mW/cm 2 . For comparison, the ClorDiSys Torch units implemented in Nebraska Medicine's N95 decontamination suite produce 0.20 mW/cm 2 at a distance of 10 feet [10, 20] . The main advantage of utilizing an already available biosafety hood is the potential for immediate implementation, as these units are widely available in biomedical research and clinical laboratories. However, one disadvantage of these units is that N95 FFRs can only be irradiated from one direction at a time, and thus require multiple exposures to decontaminate all mask surfaces. This would need to be performed carefully to avoid spreading potential contaminant from non-exposed to exposed surfaces. A second disadvantage is the time required to reach the necessary 1 J/cm 2 dose for each surface (over 4 hours per mask with two exposures at 0.13 mW/cm 2 ) as well as the 2-fold variability in UV-C irradiance at different lateral locations within the hood [19] .",

Once decontamination has been approved and prioritized from above, the highest priorities would be: 1. Formation of a workgroup to determine modality and feasibility (see below), 2. Assessment of available local resources that could be allocated towards decontamination efforts (for example, UV-C light sources and light meters), 3. Attempts to acquire necessary materials, as these are likely to be amongst the earliest rate-limiting steps, and 4. Determination of institutional regulatory/competency requirements, so that any appropriate forms and SOPs can be approved by required system entities, ideally in an expedited manner.

At our facility, masks are labeled on the edges with marker, using both a unique identifier name based on local computer login credentials and the provider's unit location. Alternative labeling techniques using tags or stickers were not an option given our mask design, as they posed the potential for incomplete mask decontamination due to UV light shading of strap components (which would be reexposed during mask re-use) or inappropriate stress points on the straps. Although discussed as a hypothetical concern, we are not aware of any data indicating that magic marker writing on the edge of the mask could degrade mask material/function, and we did not observe any instances in which magic marker caused masks to fail fit testing (either before or after decontamination).",

Since loading/unloading of the masks occurs within the UV chamber room, it can only be run approximately once per hour. If needed to increase throughput, we will convert to a cantilevered cart system, with protruding arms supporting the tensioned lines. With this improvement, carts could be loaded with masks outside of the UV chamber, while a UV decontamination cycle is taking place. This could increase throughput by about 50-80% without the addition of new UV decontamination lights. Additionally, the addition of reflective material to surround the UVGI chamber could increase the available UV-G energy delivered to each mask, while also improving the number of incident angles, and thus might further increase throughput by reducing exposure times.",
