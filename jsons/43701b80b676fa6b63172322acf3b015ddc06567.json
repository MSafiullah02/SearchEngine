This virus is similar to other two preceding coronavirus sharing 79% of its genome with those of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and 50% with those of the 2012 Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) [2] . All these viruses are able to cause liver damage, in addition to the well-known respiratory manifestations [2] . In a recent Comment, Zhang et al [3] have analyzed the effects of the virus on liver and concluded that this pathogen can alter liver enzymes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] in 14%-53% of cases, SARS-CoV-2 and as such an infection is present in 2%-11% of patients with known hepatic pathologies (chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, immune-mediated liver disease).",

            "text": "Hepatic involvement due to a predominant respiratory virosis is unclear. Liver damage appears to be of multifactorial origin. (1) Direct damage: Caused by the virus itself as it can bind to ACE-2 receptors, which are expressed in lung, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract [4, 5] . The ACE-2 receptors are particularly present in endothelial cells of the liver [6] ; (2) Intestinal translocation: It has been observed how about 2%-10% of affected patients have diarrhea, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected both in stool as well as blood samples. This could lead to a greater \"translocation\" from the intestinal lumen [3, [7] [8] [9] . In fact, we know that gut integrity, especially during abdominal sepsis, may be altered, leading to increased cellular apoptosis with subsequent altered barrier permeability [10, 11] ; (3) Drug hepatotoxicity: In their study, Zhang et al [3] have observed that liver function tended to alter both during and after the ongoing infection (COVID-19); they hypothesized a \"residual effect\" on the liver due to the drugs taken to counteract the infection. As underlined by Rismanbaf et al [12] , we must also consider the side effects of the therapies used in virosis on the liver. In their Letter, the authors emphasized how the currently used drugs, like Oseltamivir, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Ribavirin, and Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxy Chloroquine Sulfate, are all metabolized in the liver [12] . In a recent multicenter retrospective study, Liu et al [13] analyzed 32 patients, of which 28 (87.5%) had a mild or moderate disease and 4 (12.5%) had severe one, observing how liver damage was prominent in severe patients under medical therapy; and (4) Immune-mediated inflammation: the hepatic involvement that occurs during this infection must be considered as it may cause a \"cytokine storm\", especially, in severe forms of COVID-19 [14] . In this patient cohort, increased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, interferon-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were observed [15] . Adhikari et al [16] reviewing 65 research articles found how a surgery history before admission for Covid-19 was one of the factors that make people more likely to contract the infection. In fact, surgical stress can exacerbate \"cytokine storm\" and the COVID-19 disease progression (Figure 1 ). ",

They reported elevated levels of AST in 39.4% (56/142 patients) patients with severe disease compared with 18.2% (112/615 patients) patients with mild/moderate disease. Also, the levels of ALT were higher in the severe form (28.1% vs 19.8% of mild/moderate conditions) [17] . Huang et al [18] reported an increase in AST level in 62% of 13 patients recovered in Intensive Care Unit.

            "text": "Zhang et al [3] ventilation [34] . The increase in cytolysis indices may be due to several causes, including the antiviral drugs. In this regard, the histological description of liver biopsies performed on a 50-year-old subject who died owing to COVID-19 is interesting. It shows a mild lobular and portal activity associated with a moderate microvascular steatosis, as to indicate how liver damage may have been caused either directly by the virus or by the administered drugs [35] . The increase in transaminases observed in the reviewed works could also be partly due to the increased risk of toxicity when the optimal therapeutic dose is reached. As the etiology of this phenomenon can be traced back to various factors, currently there is no therapeutic approach or management for it. What can be deduced, from the available literature to date, is keeping monitoring the level of transaminases during hospitalization. As underlined by Al-Busafi et al [36] , the serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase are the best markers of hepatocellular injury and their highest levels tend to indicate a more severe liver damage. It's known that drugs with their respective dosages play a fundamental role in hepatotoxicity, especially in patients undergoing polytherapy. In a \"normal\" situation, the European Association for the Study of the Liver recommends to discontinue the involved agent, but in this type of patient it is not possible to suspend the antiviral medications [37] . Limited data are available about liver involvement in infected children with COVID-19, especially for infected infants. Cui et al [38] described a case of a 55-d-old case with COVID-19 in China who presented with altered hepatic function during hospitalization. Recently, Sun et al [39] described the laboratory findings in 8 severe patients in the ages between 2 mo and 15 years, including 6 males and 2 females. Their results showed AST in norm and ALT increased in 4 cases (50%).",
