There is no doubt that vaccines as a medical intervention have had a profound effect on controlling disease and improving the status of global health. In the two centuries since Edward Jenner's pioneering work on the smallpox vaccine, smallpox has successfully been eradicated as a result of improvements made to the vaccine over time and effective immunisation programmes. The polio vaccine has been another of the great success stories of modern medicine; the disease has effectively been eliminated in most parts of the world and the global elimination of poliomyelitis seems possible, with very few new cases in the early part of 2017 2. However, logistical, scientific and cultural challenges and high cost of the polio eradication endeavours may reduce enthusiasm for efforts to eradicate other infectious diseases with focus remaining on control. Nevertheless, the repertoire of vaccine\u2010preventable diseases (VPDs) is expanding and existing vaccines can be improved to enhance tolerability and increase the duration of protection.",

In the early 1990s, the infant vaccination programme in the UK consisted of three doses of the diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis (DTwP), and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, and oral polio vaccine, with booster doses of DT and oral polio given later in childhood and again in adolescence, the live\u2010attenuated measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In the space of the last two decades, the number of diseases against which children are immunised has greatly increased. The DTwP vaccine has been replaced by DTaP\u2010IPV\u2010Hib\u2010HBV which contains acellular pertussis and inactivated polio virus vaccines, improving the programme's safety profile with the addition of hepatitis B vaccine included in the combination during 2017. An acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) can also be given to pregnant mothers and has been shown to protect neonates against pertussis. Effective polysaccharide\u2010protein conjugate vaccines are now available for pneumococcus, Hib and capsular group A, C, W, and Y meningococcus. Rotavirus vaccine is now incorporated into the schedule and the HPV vaccine was introduced to protect girls against the major causes of cervical cancer. Vaccines against influenza, pneumococcus and shingles are now included in the programme to protect the elderly.",

The UK has benefited from a significant decline in the incidence of measles and rubella as a result of introduction of the MMR vaccine, estimated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) at 90% and 99%, respectively 3. However, the burden of VPD and infant mortality remains substantial in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries (see Fig. 1B). Recent figures show that diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine coverage has reached 86% worldwide 4, but it is estimated that, globally, as many as 19.4 million children do not have access to essential vaccines and up to 1.5 million more deaths could be avoided annually by improving vaccine coverage 1. Access to vaccines is clearly the greatest problem to be overcome in reducing infant mortality worldwide. However, there are other social factors which contribute to underuse of vaccines even in countries with full immunisation programmes in place. Scientifically, most of the remaining challenges in the field of vaccinology can be attributed to gaps in knowledge of the immune responses required to induce protection against specific pathogens, overcome pathogenic variation and enhance sub\u2010optimal immune responses in certain age groups. The main obstacles to progress in this field and reducing the global burden of infectious disease are the focus of this review.",

The problem of access to vaccines in such countries is not limited to new vaccines; there is demand for basic existing vaccines such as DTP\u2010Hib\u2010HBV, PCV, rotavirus and MMR, yet access remains insufficient 5. Inaccessibility can be as a result of lack of proximity to health services; studies have highlighted lower rates of vaccine use and delay in vaccine uptake associated with rural communities in several programmes established to combat disease in Africa such as influenza in Kenya 6 and HPV in Nigeria 7. Rural living has also been associated with lower rates of primary immunisation in more economically advantaged countries such as Ireland 8. Even in urban environments engagement in immunisation programmes can be limited by factors such as poor living conditions and lack of education, particularly amongst migrant communities which suffer from economic disadvantages 9, 10.",

This highlights the link between the empowerment of women in society and childhood immunisation, with lower rates of immunisation frequently observed in countries where women experience greater societal and domestic oppression 12. Attacks on polio workers in these countries have also hindered vaccination campaigns 13 and engagement with local political, religious and community leaders is an important component of the strategy to improve access.",

The association between unvaccinated individuals and VPD epidemics has been highlighted by a retrospective study of recent measles and pertussis outbreaks in the US which found that a significant proportion of cases in each outbreak affected those who had not received the relevant vaccine 14. There are concerns relating to the safety and necessity of vaccination among a small percentage of the population. While such hesitancy does not directly affect uptake, its influence on decision\u2010making and contribution to social uncertainty must not be underestimated. In the current era, medical and scientific authorities are under increased public scrutiny while individual choice in matters of healthcare has become more popular. The factors contributing to this are many, but controversies have had a substantial impact on attitudes towards vaccination. One recent example is the now refuted MMR claims over a proposed link with autism which was set in motion by a paper published in a medical journal in the UK and, as a result of media influence and advocacy groups, diffused across the globe 15. It took many years before public opinion reverted and MMR vaccine uptake was restored 16, though many parents still cite fear of autism as a concern 15. The best way to deal with these and other concerns that people may have is through education and public engagement but understanding the causes of hesitancy and specific interventions to address these concerns is crucial for effective management. The Vaccine Safety, Attitudes, Training and Communication Project is a European project which has shed light on many of the key issues surrounding parental attitudes to vaccination through national surveys 17. Improving understanding and acceptance of immunisation is of great importance for future national and global health.",

Once a candidate has undergone rigorous preclinical studies required to enter the clinical testing, a vaccine undergoes phase 1 safety and immunogenicity trials followed by phase 2 proof\u2010of\u2010concept studies in a larger population, and then phase 3 trials to characterise the vaccine's efficacy and safety in the target population (see Fig. 2). After a vaccine has been shown to be safe and efficacious, manufacturers must obtain regulatory approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority is the authority responsible for approvals of vaccines in the UK and similar bodies exist for other geographical regions, for example the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration regulate approvals for European and US medicines, respectively. Vaccines will often need to undergo additional local studies before approval is granted despite the availability of data from clinical studies carried out in other regions 5.",

            "text": "In order for governments to implement a licensed vaccine in their national immunisation programme, cost\u2010effectiveness is often assessed as part of the decision\u2010making process. The typical metric applied to the analysis is \u2018quality\u2010adjusted life years\u2019 which serve as an indication of the number of reasonable quality years of life a person could acquire from medical intervention. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has developed a methodology for assessing cost\u2010effectiveness and uses a cost of \u00a320\u2010\u00a330k for every quality\u2010adjusted life year as an upper limit for a public health intervention to be cost\u2010effective, though this is not the sole basis of acceptance or rejection 19. Risk of decision error, relative contribution of various sources of uncertainty and possible actions to reduce uncertainty must also be taken into consideration in order to maximise certainty of the net health benefit of a vaccine 20. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, an independent expert advisory committee, uses this methodology in making recommendations for the inclusion of a new vaccine in the immunisation schedule. Implementation policies vary between countries but all require the availability of sufficient data relating to disease burden, vaccine efficacy and economic and financial cost. Due to the multi\u2010disciplinary and region\u2010specific nature of implementation research, introduction of novel vaccines and escalation of vaccine coverage involves extensive collaboration between local research networks, industry and national government. This poses a challenge for countries which lack this infrastructure or financial capacity for implementation and will require the continued support of WHO initiatives.",

            "text": "Genetic variability of pathogens represents one of the greatest challenges to the design of novel effective vaccines. RNA viruses typically exhibit great genetic diversity and rapid evolution, making them particularly difficult targets for vaccination. This variation is partly attributable to the inherent error\u2010prone nature of RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase and its lack of proofreading activity. The rate of mutation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in vivo is astounding, estimated at 4.1 \u00b1 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 per base per cell and 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 per base per replication cycle, respectively 21, 22. Bacterial pathogens also exhibit significant diversity in circulating strains within and between different populations. Capsular polysaccharides have been effectively targeted for pneumococcus and meningococcus, but protein antigens are less conserved between strains. For example, the immunogenic outer membrane protein, PorA, of Neisseria meningitidis exhibits phase variation through a combination of mutation, site\u2010specific recombination and epigenetic control of promoter regions, allowing the bacterium to evade bactericidal antibodies directed against this antigen 23. The protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum also exhibits antigenic diversity with polymorphisms in variable regions of its genome producing a range of antigen variants across endemic regions 24. Even when relatively conserved structural proteins are targeted in vaccine formulations, universal vaccine efforts will require advanced knowledge of molecular epidemiology and genetic variability between populations. Understanding the structural biology of antigen components of vaccine formulations is an important consideration when targeting multiple strains of a pathogen and extending vaccine strain coverage.",

Meta\u2010analyses have highlighted the link between several HLA allelic variants and other immune receptor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and differential antibody responses to a number of vaccines 25. The strongest correlation between genotype and phenotype is seen in complete non\u2010responders to the hepatitis B vaccine whose HLA class II alleles are associated with antibody response to hepatitis B 26. A more complete understanding of the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms identified in genome\u2010wide studies through functional studies will be important in developing improved vaccines to overcome such variation within the population. Successful disease elimination is dependent on uniform responses to immunisation within a population if the effects of individual phenotypes cannot be overcome through herd immunity.",

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was established in the wake of this epidemic to fund the research and development of diagnostics, therapies and vaccines for epidemic infectious diseases (EIDs) to prevent a repeat of such a catastrophe 27. Its priorities include pathogens associated with recent outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Ebola and Zika virus, and several other emerging pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).

Collaborative efforts between scientists and between academia and industry will be vital for tackling future epidemics. There is much research to be done on known pathogens which represent possible threats and have not been as extensively characterised as those which have attracted the most funding in the past. This disparity can only be resolved by incentivising investment in research and development. On the other hand, the next threats to global health may be totally unknown. Recent outbreaks have increased awareness of the importance of scientific surveillance and potential pandemic control measures. Improving preparedness for the emergence of novel pathogens will rely more heavily on the mandatory reporting of surveillance data, the international flow of information to provide rapid and effective control, and the development of platform technologies into which components of new pathogens can be inserted in the rapid development of new vaccines.",

As the leading cause of infant hospitalisation worldwide, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) warrants particular attention. RSV is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in infants worldwide and, considering its burden, is the most important infant disease which can be prevented by a vaccine for which no licensed vaccine exists 29. The virus causes respiratory tract infections (RTIs) which range from mild upper RTIs to severe lower RTIs, with up to half of children suffering from the latter developing recurrent wheezing or asthma 30. After malaria, RSV is the leading cause of infectious death in infants worldwide and is responsible for approximately 6.7% of all deaths in this age group 31. At the time of writing (June 2017) there were 59 vaccine candidates in various stages of development, 16 of which were undergoing clinical evaluation 32. However, the paucity of data relating to the epidemiology of RSV, transmission of the virus and the full health\u2010care burden, especially in low resource settings, will be an impediment to the decision\u2010making process for inclusion of a successful vaccine candidate in national immunisation programmes and must be addressed.",

Indeed, one candidate has been demonstrated safe and immunogenic in pregnant women and a Phase III clinical trial has been initiated to determine its efficacy 34. Maternal immunisation has become an important approach to providing early protection in neonates and simultaneously offering a level of protection to pregnant women. During the natural course of a pregnancy, IgG antibodies are transferred from the mother to the developing foetus across the placental barrier via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) present on syncytiotrophoblast cells, conferring passive immunity 35. For diseases such as pertussis which have peak incidence in the first months of life, maternal immunisation could provide protection for babies prior to receiving active routine immunisation in early infancy. Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (TDaP) vaccination in pregnant women has provided proof\u2010of\u2010principle that vaccination of pregnant women is safe for both mother and child and that antibodies can be protective in newborns 36. Such a strategy would also be effective in the prevention of group B streptococcal infection (GBS), which is transferred from mother to child at birth and can cause pneumonia, bacteraemia and meningitis in 2\u20133% of colonised neonates 37. A GBS candidate vaccine has also recently been shown to be safe and immunogenic in pregnant women 38.

Infections caused by Clostridium difficile, norovirus, and antibiotic\u2010resistant Gram negative bacteria have become more frequent with the increasing use of antibiotics over the last few decades while Staphylococcus aureus remains the leading cause of HCAIs worldwide. The WHO recently published a list of a dozen families of bacteria which represent a serious threat to public health as a result of their acquisition of resistance genes 44. Among these pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae were cited as being of highest priority.

In the case of HIV and HCV it is the considerable variability of protein sequence which develops during infection, which makes development of an inactivated vaccine based on a single sequence ineffective. Further understanding of the immune response to HIV may eventually provide the solution. One approach could be identification of broadly neutralising antibodies to prevent infection with the virus and cytotoxic T cell responses capable of eliminating infected CD4+ T cells. The induction of broadly\u2010neutralising antibody responses to HIV epitopes has been exemplified in recent studies of HIV envelope trimers in primates 45.

To this end, challenge studies have been particularly informative for malaria vaccine development and had an important role to play in the optimisation of the malaria RTS,S vaccine 47. The establishment of phase I trials and human challenge studies in endemic regions is enhancing optimisation of malaria vaccines for target populations.",

With regard to the former, efforts have been made to improve the existing Bacillus Calmette\u2010Gu\u00e9rin vaccine but have been hampered by lack of understanding for the variable efficacy of the vaccine against pulmonary TB 48. TB vaccine development would benefit greatly from the identification of new correlates of protection and animal models which more accurately reflect the progression of human TB. Indeed, it remains unknown which responses are important in prevention of infection, while the responses used to contain natural infection, such as polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell responses, are better understood 49. Transcriptomic analyses often accompany vaccine efficacy studies and are an important tool for the identification of early gene \u201csignatures\u201d which may predict immunogenicity. Extensive characterisation of the yellow fever vaccine, YF\u201017D, has provided proof\u2010of\u2010principle for the ability of such gene signatures to predict immune responses and protective immunity following immunisation 50, 51. This transcriptomics/ systems biology approach will be a useful tool to delineate new correlates of protection and will aid vaccine candidate selection in the future.",

This is particularly important for dengue virus given that during a natural infection an infected individual generates long\u2010lived, protective, neutralising antibodies against that serotype, but antibodies directed against other serotypes are cross\u2010reactive and non\u2010neutralising. This leads to an immunological phenomenon known as antibody\u2010dependent enhancement whereby dengue virus particles opsonised by these non\u2010neutralising antibodies infect Fc receptor\u2010expressing cells such as macrophages and monocytes 52. The possibility of exacerbation of a secondary heterologous dengue virus infection requires a quadrivalent vaccine that produces consistent and long\u2010lasting protection against all four serotypes to preclude this immunological enhancement.",

As adaptive responses decline in an ageing immune system due to the reduction in peripheral na\u00efve T cells and B cells and the resultant shift towards memory phenotype and decrease in antigen\u2010specific responses, the elderly experience heightened morbidity and mortality from infections, particularly in those aged 80\u2013100 years 53. These changes are described as immunosenescence and represent an issue of growing global concern for the maintenance of a healthy aging population. The current thinking is that in advanced age, the differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells into lymphoid and myeloid precursors skews in the direction of the latter, leading to fewer lymphocytes in the circulation, the causes of which are reviewed elsewhere 54. The result is an immune system that is more vulnerable to infection with certain pathogens but which is also less responsive to immunisation.",

Several other vaccines from the immunisation schedule have been studied in this age group but of these, only the TDaP vaccine induces a protective immune response comparable to that induced when it is administered earlier in life 55. While the trivalent influenza vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and herpes zoster vaccine are capable of mitigating their respective diseases to varying degrees, they do not induce a satisfactory immune response in the majority of the elderly population. Recent efforts to improve vaccine responses in the elderly have focused on increasing vaccine doses 56, exploring the use of alternative adjuvants to stimulate the innate response and engineering viral vectors to engage T cell responses 57. Some success has been achieved, for example, the zoster glycoprotein vaccine incorporating the AS01B adjuvant system was recently shown to reduce the risk of herpes zoster infection in adults greater than 70 years of age in a Phase III clinical trial 58. Greater understanding of the immunological factors that underlie the ageing adaptive response at the molecular and cellular level will be imperative to the development of restorative interventions that promote functional response to vaccination.",

Recent UK\u2010based networks include those focused on maternal vaccines, vaccines for persistent intracellular infections, bacterial diseases and supporting the use of live infection challenge of volunteers to advance vaccinology 60.
