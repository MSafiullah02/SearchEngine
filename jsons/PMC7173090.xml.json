Wild birds are probably the most important natural reservoir hosts of IAVs as they maintain a vast viral gene pool and pose a continuous threat to humans and other mammalian species (Yoon et al., 2014). Agricultural practices and ecological systems in China and other eastern Asian countries have provided ample opportunities for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) to cross species barriers and cause sporadic infections in mammals (Su et al., 2014a, Su et al., 2014b, Su et al., 2015a, Su et al., 2015b). An AIV of the H5N6 subtype was responsible for a recent outbreak amongst birds in Laos, Vietnam, and China that resulted in the culling of \u223c100,000 chickens (Bi et al., 2015, Guillaume Belot et al., 2014, Qi et al., 2014, Shen et al., 2015, Wong et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2015a). H5N6 AIVs also pose a public health threat as four human infections with H5N6 were reported in China in 2014 (three of which were lethal) (He and Duan, 2015, Pan et al., 2015, Takai et al., 1990, Yang et al., 2015).",

Serological studies have suggested that they may act as vectors of influenza transmission within households (McCullers et al., 2011, Su et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2014). Cats are susceptible to AIVs as natural infections of cats with H3N2(Jeoung et al., 2013), H5N1(Songserm et al., 2006, Yingst et al., 2006), and H5N6 have been reported (Yu et al., 2015).

However, the innate immunity in cats is less known, which limits the understanding of the effect of AIV infection on cat innate immune response. The construction of feline IFN-\u03b2 promoter report system (Tian et al., 2015) would provide a good method to investigate it.",

            "text": "The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of IAV is an IFN antagonist. It interacts with a diverse range of cellular factors to antagonize host antiviral defenses and promote viral replication (Garcia-Sastre, 2001). Activation of IRF-3 is blocked through NS1 specifically binding to RIG-I, which inhibits the expression of IFN-\u03b2(Mibayashi et al., 2007). It also suppresses RIG-I CARD ubiquitination mediated by TRIM25, which blocks the RIG-I signal transduction (Gack et al., 2009, Rajsbaum et al., 2012). Another mechanism by which the NS1 protein counteracts the host antiviral response is through the disruption of IKK(Gao et al., 2012). With regard to H5N1 viruses, some (but not all) NS1 proteins can effectively block IFN induction. For example, Peirong Jiao et al. reported that H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from ducks, A/Duck/Guangxi/12/2003 (DK/12) and A/Duck/Guangxi/27/2003 (DK/27), differed in their ability to induce/block IFN(Jiao et al., 2008) (i.e. DK12 inhibited IFN while DK27 did not), and this was due to a polymorphism at amino acid position 42 of NS1(Jiao et al., 2008).",

Phylogenetic analysis of NS1 sequences derived from H5N1 and H5N6 IAVs showed that the NS1 of A/feline/Guangdong/1/2015 (H5N6) clustered together with previously published H5N6 viruses but not with H5N1 viruses (Fig. S1). As the impact of H5N6 NS1 on the IFN response has not been previously determined, we wondered whether the NS1 protein of A/feline/Guangdong/1/2015 could block activation of IFN-\u03b2 response. To this end, CRFK cells were cotransfected with IFN+33-Luc and pRL-TK, together with plasmid encoding the NS1 and further inoculated with SeV at 24 hpt. RLA was determined at 12 hpi. We observed that expression of H5N6 NS1 protein inhibited SeV-mediated activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter, which depended on a concentration of plasmid (Fig. 3\nA). We next examined whether NS1 could prevent or delay the activation of NF-\u03baB and/or IRF3 by SeV. To this end, CRFK cells were cotransfected with plasmids 3 \u00d7 PRDII, and 3 \u00d7 PRDIII/I, together with pRL-TK and the NS1 expression plasmid. SeV was inoculated at 24 hpt and the RLA was determined at 12 hpi. Compared with the transfection with empty vector, the expression of the NS1 protein resulted in a 69.1% and 82.1% reduction in NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activation induced by SeV, respectively (Fig. 3B). To further investigate if NS1 inhibited induction of the NF-\u03baB and IRF3 pathways, CRFK cells pre-transfected with the NS1 expression plasmid or vector were inoculated with SeV at 24 hpt. At 0, 6, 9 and 12 hpi, nuclear proteins were prepared and subject to EMSA with a probe for NF-\u03baB. The levels of activated NF-\u03baB in the NS1 expression group were lower than in the control groups at 9 and 12 hpi (Fig. 3C). NF-\u03baB contains p50 and p65 subunit. We also determined the levels of p65 by immunostaining. The levels of nuclear p65 from the cells transfected with the NS1 expression plasmid were lower than in the control groups at 6, 9 and 12 hpi (Fig. 3D). In the same experiment, cytoplasmic extracts were also obtained and subjected to immunostaining with specific antibodies for phosphorylated IRF3 and inactivated IRF3. The result showed that NS1 reduced the levels of phosphorylated IRF3 at 6, 9 and 12 hpi with SeV (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that NS1 inhibits activation of the IFN-\u03b2 response by blocking activation of the NF-\u03baB and IRF3 pathways.",

To test the minimum requirements of H5N6 NS1 for antagonizing the IFN-\u03b2 response, plasmid expressing the minimal dsRNA binding domain of NS1 (1\u201373) and its mutant (R38A/K41A) were constructed. The double mutation would attenuate NS1 dsRNA binding ability. The minimal dsRNA binding domain of NS1 (1\u201373) led to a significant inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 response upon SeV infection (Fig. 4\nA). In turn, such suppression was significantly reduced by double NS1 mutant (Fig. 4A).

As shown in Fig. 5\nA, over-expression of feline IFN- \u03b2 resulted in a reduction in virus yield by 1.2 \u00b1 0.20 log10TCID50. However, the over-expression of IFN-\u03b2 at 12 hpi could not significantly inhibit virus replication (Fig. 5B). These results indicated that the over-expression of IFN-\u03b2 before challenge could inhibit H5N6 virus replication, but its over-expression after challenge could not.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses that are similar with Coronaviruses, are RNA zoonotic viruses which have highly susceptible to recombination and cross species transmission (Su et al., 2016b). It has been previously established that cats are susceptible to AIVs as natural infections in cats with H3N2(Jeoung et al., 2013), H5N1(Songserm et al., 2006, Yingst et al., 2006) and H5N6(Yu et al., 2015) AIVs have been reported. Innate immunity is the first line of defense against viral infection, which critically depends on a successful type I interferon response (Rodriguez-Calvo et al., 2014). While many viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway (Didcock et al., 1999, Fensterl et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2000), it was less known how avian influenza virus circumvent this innate protective response in cats. In this study, we found that an H5N6 avian influenza virus isolated from cats could replicate well and led to the CPE in CRFK cells. Using dual luciferase report gene systems driven by the feline IFN-\u03b2-responsive promoter, we found that virus infection inhibited the induction of IFN-\u03b2 response by blocking the NF-\u03baB and IRF3 pathways. Further, we found that NS1 protein, a general inhibitor of the interferon signaling pathway, could inhibit feline IFN response by reducing the entry of NF-\u03baB into nucleus and the phosphorylation of IRF3, which depended on the dsRNA binding domain. Additionally, over-expression of IFN-\u03b2 before infection could inhibit H5N6 virus replication. This study helps us to understand how an H5N6 avian influenza virus can disrupt the cat innate immune response and then successfully infect cats.",

Not all the isolates like the well-characterized laboratory strain A/PR/8/34 can block the production of IFN-\u03b2, and infection with different viruses results in moderate IFN-beta stimulation (Hayman et al., 2006). Based on the conclusion that the amino acid S42 of NS1 is responsible for the H5N1 influenza virus to inhibit the IFN response (Jiao et al., 2008), the amino acid S42 of NS1 in H5N6 used in this study may contribute to the blockage of IFN response. Thus, we thought it was necessary to investigate whether the avian influenza virus isolated from cats could affect the IFN-\u03b2 response. While several studies reported that influenza virus isolated from birds or humans can block the IFN-\u03b2 response (Gack et al., 2009, Gao et al., 2012, Hale et al., 2008, Jiao et al., 2008, Kuo et al., 2010, Mibayashi et al., 2007), no study has investigated whether cat isolates can also inhibit this pathway.",

Critical transcription factors for regulating IFN-\u03b2 expression include IRF-3/7, NF-\u03baB and AP1. Some of the proteins involved in NF-\u03baB and IRF3 pathways are responsible for the amplification of intracellular signals from upstream stimuli. MAVS is one of such proteins and its inhibition contributes to the blockade of the IFN signal pathway of NF-\u03baB and IRF3. A previous study showed that the influenza virus polymerase regulated the host anti-viral response through binding to MAVS and thus inhibiting IFN production (Iwai et al., 2010). AP-1 is a downstream effector of the MAPK signaling pathway that regulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon TLR4 activation (Adler et al., 2010). The MAPK signaling pathway differs from the NF-\u03baB and IRF3 pathways. We have shown that infection with A/feline/Guangdong/1/2015 inhibited the activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB and did not affect the AP1 activation, which was consistent with other reports.",

Mibayashi et al. first reported that the NS1 of IAV prevents the transcriptional induction of IFN-\u03b2 by binding to RIG-I and inhibiting downstream activation of IRF3(Mibayashi et al., 2007). It has also been shown that NS1 specifically inhibits TRIM25-mediated RIG-I CARD ubiquitination, which blocks RIG-I signal transduction (Gack et al., 2009, Rajsbaum et al., 2012). A new mechanism by which IAV NS1 counteracts the host NF-\u03baB-mediated antiviral response is through the disruption of IKK pathway (Gao et al., 2012). Besides suppressing the IFN-\u03b2 response, NS1 can also shut off host gene expression (Khaperskyy and McCormick, 2015). In this study, we showed that the NS1 of A/feline/Guandong/1/2015 suppressed SeV-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b2 promoter via reducing the levels of nuclear p65 and phosphorylated IRF3 in feline cells. Both NF-\u03baB and IRF3 pathways were inhibited by NS1 expression, which was determined by the dsRNA-binding domain of NS1. NS1 protein can bind to influenza virus RNA and also nonspecifically to dsRNA in vitro (Talon et al., 2000). It was speculated that NS1 may block the formatin of dsRNA, which is necessary for the activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. However, the exact molecular mechanism(s) of such inhibition should be investigated further. Our findings also provide an example of a H5N6 virus from cats suppressing IFN production.",
