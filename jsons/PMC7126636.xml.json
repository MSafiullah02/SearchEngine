Some of these diverse functions are regulated by proteases that cleave and thereby may activate, inactivate, or release other proteins or peptides. These regulatory proteases are either located on the cell surface or are secreted by the cells. Both types of proteases may fulfill similar functions, but cell-surface proteases appear to have in general more regulatory and specialized functions than secreted ones. In particular, they are involved in the regulation of the activity of peptides that communicate between cells or tissues (oligopeptidases, cell-surface peptidases in the original sense), in the degradation of extracellular components (matrix proteases), or in the shedding of cell-surface proteins (secretases, sheddases).",

These important physiological roles have focused attention on cell-surface peptidases in recent pharmacological research. Inhibitors are widely used as drugs or are under development. This review will provide an overview of the general properties and physiological and pharmacological importance of mammalian cell-surface (oligo)peptidases. A closer view will be given to a selected peptidase of actual pharmacological interest, the dipeptidyl-peptidase IV.",

Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) belong to the group of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that is primarily involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components. MMPs are mostly secreted, and cell-surface MT-MMPs either act like the secreted MMPs or activate them. Secretases or sheddases are proteases that release soluble forms from transmembrane proteins or peptides, e.g., cell-surface receptors, membrane anchored cytokines or chemokines, other membrane proteases, or the amyloid precursor protein. They belong to the group of ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase). ADAMs may cleave and release other cell-surface peptidases to yield soluble forms. Since MT-MMPs and ADAMs both act on larger proteins and belong either to a broader group of secreted proteases (MMPs) or represent a distinct group from the (oligo)peptidases, they will be excluded from this review (the reader is referred to specialized reviews for more information: Itoh 2002, Moss 2002, Visse 2003, Zucker 2003).",

Therefore it is not surprising that some cell-surface peptidases may have multiple functions, as a regulatory peptidase, extracellular protease, or a binding protein.

The Enzyme Nomenclature EC list (1992) (http:\u29f8\u29f8www.chem.qmw.ac.uk\u29f8iubmb\u29f8enzyme\u29f8index.html) recommends the term peptidase as the general form.

This database gives excellent, precise, and detailed information about proteases of many species. In this scheme, a family of peptidases is a group in which each member shows a statistically significant relationship in amino acid sequence to at least another member of the family. The term clan is used to describe a group of families the members of which have evolved from a single ancestral protein, but have diverged so far that their relationship cannot be proved by direct comparison of their primary structures.",

For example, the secreted, soluble urokinase (urokinase-type plasminogen activator, EC 3.4.21.73), a protease involved in the activation of other proteases, blot-clot lysis, and cell invasion, is bound to the cell surface via a specific membrane receptor. As integral membrane proteins, cell-surface peptidases either possess a transmembrane region with the N- (type I) or C-terminus (type II) extracellular, or they are linked to the membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Fig. 1\n).

Therefore, cell surface peptidases are also termed ectopeptidases. According to catalytic type, cell-surface peptidases possess either a catalytic triad of His, Asp, and Ser (serine peptidases) or a metallo-binding motif for a divalent cation, normally zinc (metalloproteases). The known metal ligands in metalloproteases are His, Glu, Asp, or Lys. In addition to the metal ligands, at least one other residue is required for catalysis, mostly Glu, but also Arg and Lys. Normally, the catalytic site is found only in one catalytic center, but, e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) can have two catalytic HEXXH metalloprotease motifs (Barrett 1998, Hooper 1994). The three-dimensional structure of some cell-surface peptidases (metallo- and serine peptidases) has been clarified in some examples of pharmacological importance, and the reader is referred to original and more specialized review articles (Engel 2003, Lowther 2002, Natesh 2003, Rasmussen 2003).",

The highest levels are found in lung, placenta, kidney, intestine, blood vessels, brain, and peripheral nerves. On hematopoietic, cells CPM is found on discrete B lymphocyte developmental stages and on mature (mostly activated) T cells (de Saint-Vis et al., 1995). Also, soluble forms exist in various body fluids. CPM is supposed to inactivate bradykinin partially: CPM-truncated bradykinin is inactive at the B2 receptor, but binds to the B1 receptor. Furthermore, CPM removal of the C-terminal Arg of human anaphylatoxin C5a abolishes its spasmogenic and histamine-releasing activity, whereas about 10% of the chemotactic activity is retained. Also, several growth factors (epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, erythropoietin, brain-derived neurotrophic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, oncostatin M, and others) are truncated by CPM, but the physiological importance remains to be established (Barrett 1998, Mentlein 1996, Skidgel 1998).",

The main physiological substrates are angiotensin I and bradykinin. However, the substrate specificity is relatively broad and enkephalins, dynorphins, neurotensin, and other are also cleaved. Furthermore, ACE also displays endopeptidase activities toward des-Arg-9-bradykinin, dynorphin, substance P, and gonadoliberin. ACE exists in two isoforms, a somatic form of 150\u2013180 kDa in endothelial, epithelial, and neuronal cells, and a smaller isoform (90\u2013110 kDa) in germinal cells. Furthermore, a soluble (shedded) form exists. Based on the conversion of angiotensin I to (active) angiotensin II by ACE, the control of blood pressure and salt metabolism is regarded as its main physiological role. Consequently, highly specific ACE inhibitors have been developed that are widely used as antihypertensive drugs. The main side effects of ACE inhibitors are attributed the prolongation of the lifetime\u29f8effects of bradykinin. However, ACE may also have another function as a regulatory peptidase, especially in the brain. For details on this well-investigated cell-surface peptidase and its physiological and pharmacological importance the reader is referred to detailed reviews (Barrett 1998, Corvol 1995, Menard 2001, Skidgel 1987). In addition to the long known ACE, a further similar cell-surface enzyme has been recently discovered, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2, ACEH), which also converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, but not bradykinin. ACE2 is not inhibited by lisinopril or captopril. The organ- and cell-specific expression of ACE2 and its unique cleavage of key vasoactive peptides suggest an essential role for ACE2 in the local renin\u2013angiotensin system of the heart and kidney (Danilczyk 2003, Turner 2002).",

The principal substrates are enkephalins, atrial natriuretic peptides, substance P, and other tachykinins, but various other regulatory peptides (e.g., somatostatin, neurokinin, cholecystokinin-8, bradykinin, gastrin-releasing peptide, calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and the chemotactic bacterial peptide fMet-Leu-Phe) are cleaved (Kenny 1977, Kenny 1991).

The catalytic triad, Ser-630, Asp-708, and His-740, is invertedly arranged as compared to the trypsin-like serine proteases (His-Asp-Ser); therefore, DPP IV is classified as a nonclassical serine protease. The active site sequence GWSYG around the catalytic serine residue (David 1993, Ogata 1992) corresponds to the consensus sequence GXSXG of serine proteases and is found in one copy at positions 628\u2013632 (human sequence). A single substitution in this sequence in a substrain of Fisher-344 rats (G to R; active site GWSYR) results in loss of enzymatic activity.

In comparison, soluble serum DPP IV or CD26 on leukocytes has less total activity (Mentlein, 1999), but contributes further to hormone degradation. The most important physiological and pharmacological DPP IV substrates to date are the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. They belong to a family of 27\u201344 residue peptides, the glucagon peptide family. Those with a penultimate Ala, namely GRH, GLP-1, GLP-2, GIP, and PHM, are good DPP IV substrates (Lambeir 2002, Mentlein 1993b); those with a penultimate Ser, namely glucagon, secretin, VIP, and PACAP-27, are relatively poor substrates (Hinke 2000, Lambeir 2001a) and will not be discussed here.",

GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo. It plays an important role in the regulation of postprandial insulin release and is the most important incretin (insulinotropic hormone) known so far (Fig. 4\n). In patients with type 2 diabetes, exogenous GLP-1 lowers postprandial plasma glucose excursions by stimulating insulin release and by inhibiting glucagon secretion. Since the biological half-life of GLP-1 is very short, the use of exogenous GLP-1 or prolongation of its action is considered as a new possibility in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 is also produced in the brain, and intracerebroventricular GLP-1 in rodents is a potent inhibitor of food and water intake. GLP-2 displays an intestinal growth factor activity in rodents, raising the possibility that GLP-2 may be therapeutically useful for enhancement of mucosal regeneration in patients with intestinal diseases (Drucker 1998, Drucker 2003a). Understanding the inactivation of GLP-1 and GLP-2 is therefore of potential therapeutic interest.",

After subcutaneous or intravenous administration of GLP-1 in healthy or type 2 diabetic humans more than 75% was recovered from the plasma as des(His-Ala)-GLP-1 (Deacon et al., 1995b). After intravenous injection of 125I-radiolabeled GLP-1 at picomolar concentrations into rats more than 50% was metabolized to des(His-Ala)-GLP-1 within 2 mins, but not in DPP IV-negative rats (Kieffer et al., 1995). This conversion could be blocked in vitro and in vivo by specific DPP IV inhibitors such as diprotin a or Lys- or Val-pyrrolidide. Pharmacological inhibition of DPP IV with valine-pyrrolidide in anesthetized pigs, at a dose that reduced plasma DPP IV activity by more than 90%, increased the amount of intact GLP-1 both in the basal state and after infusion (Deacon et al., 1995b). Moreover, inhibition of DPP IV by Ile-thiazolidide in Zucker rats potentiated the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 after intravenous infusion alone or with glucose (Pederson et al., 1998). Furthermore, glucose tolerance and insulin secretion are enhanced in DPP IV knockout mice (Marguet et al., 2000) and in DPP IV activity-deficient Fischer 344 rats (Nagakura et al., 2001) in comparison to normal mice or Fischer rats. However, inhibition of DPP IV in these normal animals showed similar effects. Meanwhile, improved glucose tolerance under DPP IV inhibition has also been proven in humans (Ahr\u00e9n et al., 2002). Therefore, inhibition of DPP IV is regarded as a validated target for treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

When injected into normal rats, GLP-2 induces an increase in intestinal villus height and has a small trophic effect on small bowel weight. Administration of GLP-2 into DPP IV-deficient rats markedly increased the bioactivity of rat GLP-2 resulting in a significant increase in small bowel weight (Drucker et al., 1997a). Again, DPP IV-resistant GLP-2 analogues show higher effects than GLP-2 in wild-type animals, e.g., a statistically significant increase in small bowel mass was produced by the analogue r[Gly(2)]-GLP-2 in rats and by the human analogue h[Gly(2)]-GLP-2 in mice (Drucker 1997a, Drucker 1997b). These results show that inactivation of GLP-2 by DPP IV is of critical importance for its growth factor properties in the intestine and that DPP IV-resistant analogues may be useful therapeutics to improve mucosal regeneration.",

It inhibits the secretion of gastric acid and stimulates insulin release from pancreatic \u03b2 cells in the presence of elevated glucose levels. Thus, in addition to GLP-1, GIP also contributes to incretin activity of postprandial serum (Fig. 4), more in rodents and less in humans (Meier et al., 2002). As the other members of the GRH-glucagon family with a penultimate Ala, GIP is also rapidly degraded to GIP(3\u201342) by purified human DPP IV or serum with DPP IV activity in vitro (Mentlein et al., 1993b) and in vivo (Deacon et al., 2000). This truncation of GIP in serum could be successfully inhibited by coincubation with specific DPP IV inhibitors in vitro and in vivo (Deacon 2001, Kieffer 1995, Mentlein 1993b). GIP(3\u201342) was also detected after purification of GIP from pig intestine (J\u00f6rnvall et al., 1981), and later it was shown that it lacked any biological activity and is even a weak GIP receptor antagonist in vivo (Gault 2002, Schmidt 1987). As reported for GLP-1, GIP was also rapidly degraded in vivo to the truncated form (50% after 2 min) after injection of radioiodinated GIP into wild-type rats, but not in DPP IV-deficient ones (Kieffer et al., 1995). In accordance, after oral administration of a DPP IV inhibitor the half-life of GIP was prolonged in wild-type rats or pigs (Deacon 2001, Kieffer 1995) or DPP IV-resistant analogues are more potent in normal or obese rats (Hinke et al., 2002). Thus, as for GLP-1 and GLP-2, DPP IV truncation is also the main degradation route for GIP in vivo.",

It is released from the hypothalamus and stimulates the release and the synthesis of growth hormone from and in the pituitary. In human plasma GRH(1\u201344)-NH2 (or fragments) is rapidly metabolized to GRH(3\u201344)-NH2; further minor degradation products derive from endoproteolytic cleavage of the Arg(11)-Lys(12) or Lys(12)-Val(13) bonds (Frohman et al., 1989). All these proteolytic fragments are biologically inactive. By use of specific inhibitors, DPP IV and a trypsin-like endoprotease were identified as the proteases responsible for this processing. Following this initial report, DPP IV-mediated proteolysis was established as a major route of GRH degradation and inactivation in rat (Boulanger et al., 1992), porcine, and bovine plasma in vitro and in cattle in vivo (Kubiak 1998, Kubiak 1989). Again, DPP IV-resistant peptide analogues of GRH(1\u201329) showed similar biological activity to induce growth hormone release in vitro (cultivated pituitary cells), but higher potency to increase serum growth hormone levels in vivo up to 60 min after injection into cattle due to longer stability in vivo (Kubiak and Friedman, 1998).",

Together with PYY and pancreatic polypeptide (PP), it belongs to a peptide family of 36-residue peptides with high homology in primary and tertiary structure. NPY is an abundant neuropeptide in the central and peripheral nervous system; it is involved in the control of feeding, energy homeostasis, and blood pressure. As with PYY, NPY is also rapidly degraded by DPP IV in vitro to des(Tyr-Pro)NPY (Mentlein et al., 1993a), and this truncated form has been identified as a considerable part (35%) of the total NPY extracted from porcine brain (Grandt et al., 1996) and in the human cerebrospinal fluid (Nilsson et al., 1998). Full-length NPY, PYY, and PP bind with different affinities to at least five receptor subtypes (Y1 and Y2\u2014NPY and PYY, Y3\u2014NPY > PYY, Y4\u2014PP, and Y5\u2014all three), but N-terminally truncated NPY (and PYY) lacks affinity to the Y1 receptor (Gerald et al., 1996), which is located in the cerebral cortex and on vascular smooth muscle cells where it promotes vasoconstriction and cell proliferation. Due to the receptor subtype-specific regulation of NPY activity, DPP IV has already been termed an \u201cNPY-converting enzyme.\u201d In this respect, DPP IV appears to be involved in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle contraction, angiogenesis (Zukowska-Grojec et al., 1998), and, in particular, endothelial cell migration (Ghersi et al., 2001) and edema (Dimitrijevic et al., 2002).",

Therefore, the sequential liberation of the dipeptides Arg-Pro and Lys-Pro from the N-terminus of the undecapeptide substance P (Heymann 1978, Kato 1978) does not abolish its biological activity at the tachykinin receptors. However, the fragment substance P-(5\u201311) has a lower binding activity for the preferred substance P receptor, the NK1 receptor (Mussap et al., 1993). Only effects for which the first four residues in substance P are essential, e.g., the degranulation of mast cells (probably non-receptor-mediated by pertubation of the membrane), may be completely abolished by DPP IV cleavage. However, substance P truncated by DPP IV can be further attacked by aminopeptidase N, which is an important degradation pathway in human plasma, at the vascular endothelium, at fibroblasts, and muscle myocytes (Wang 1991, Wang 1994). This may explain the potentiation of neurogenic inflammation and enhanced vasodilation by DPP IV inhibitors in nasal mucosa (Grouzmann et al., 2002).",

Chemokines constitute a large group of small (8\u201310 kDa) secreted proteins that act as cell-type-selective chemoattractants. They can be divided into four subfamilies, based on structural, functional, and genetic criteria. The two most important subfamilies are the CXC and CC chemokines (\u03b1- and \u03b2-family), which differ in the spacing of the first two cysteine residues that form disulfide links with two other cysteines. In CXC chemokines these first cysteine residues are separated by one amino acid; in CC chemokines they are directly neighbored. Generally, DPP IV cleavage of chemokines abolishes their chemotactic activity. In some cases the truncated forms act as weak antagonists. However, up to now no experimental evidence has been given on the importance of this process in vivo. DPP IV inhibitors often show an antiinflammatory effect (Steinbrecher et al., 2001), not a potentiation of the inflammatory response as expected for prolongation of chemokine action. In accordance, DPP IV inhibitors did not enhance the chemotaxis of I-TAC (CXCL11) on activated human T cells in vitro that express both DPP IV\u29f8CD26 and the chemokine receptor CXCR3 (Mentlein et al., 2003). However, different results have been found for the chemotactic effect of SDF-1\u03b1 (CXCL12) on human cord blood CD34+ progenitors cells that also coexpress DPP IV\u29f8CD26 and the receptor CXCR4 (Christopherson et al., 2002).",

Prolongation of GLP-1 action by inhibition of its degradation or application of DPP IV-resistant GLP-1 analogues has been shown to enhance insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in vivo. GLP-1 analogues modified at the N-terminal His(1), Ala(2), and Glu(3) by the corresponding d- or different amino acids, e.g., d-Ala(2)-GLP-1, have longer half-lives and consequently higher insulinotropic potencies in vitro and in vivo (Burcelin 1999, Deacon 1998b, Siegel 1999a, Siegel 1999b). Though this modification is a rather specific approach for type 2 diabetes with low side effects, it has the drawback that GLP-1 peptide analogues cannot be given orally, in contrast to small DPP IV inhibitors (Augustyns et al., 2003), which have more potential side effects. However, recent clinical studies with an orally active DPP IV inhibitor in type 2 diabetic patients show a considerably better insulin tolerance and improved HBA1c levels after 4 weeks of treatment (Ahr\u00e9n et al., 2002). Side effects were surprisingly low (partly nasopharyngitis, pruritus, and transient nephritic syndrome). Thus, DPP IV inhibitors appear to be promising drugs for treatment of some stages of type 2 diabetes.",

            "text": "\nFibroblast activation protein \u03b1 (FAP, seprase, 3.4.21\u2013) is a type II transmembrane protein of 97-kDa subunits that has about 52% homology (human sequences) to DPP IV but acts mainly as an endopeptidase on extracellular matrix protein (Table V; Barrett 1998, Goldstein 1997, Scanlan 1994). In normal tissues, FAP is found only in fetal mesenchymal cells and a subset of glucagon-producing cells (A cells) in pancreatic islets. However, activated fibroblasts, either cultivated, in wounds or in tumors, cultivated melanocytes, and sarcoma cells express FAP. The biological function has not been clarified, but it is suspected that FAP is involved in wound healing. Due to its selective occurrence, FAP is a good target for tumor immunodetection and destructive tumor therapy. DPP IV and FAP reside on a neighbor gene locus (Table V) and may therefore originate by gene duplication. They can form homodimers, but usually do not occur together.",

It releases unsubstituted, C-terminal glutamyl residues from Ac-Asp-Glu or pteroyl-\u03b3; in particular it hydrolyzes \u03b3-peptide bonds in Ac-Asp-Glu, Asp-Glu, and Glu-Glu, but also \u03b3-glutamyl bonds in \u03b3-Glu-Glu and folylpoly-\u03b3-glutamates. According to more recent investigations it has no DPP IV activty (Barinka et al., 2002). The enzyme requires zink (2 per subunit), is activated by cobalt, and is inhibited by quisqualic acid, 2-(phosphonomethyl) pentanedioic acid (PMPA), and EDTA. Primary sources are prostate epithelium, as well as the small intestine (specifically in jejunum brush border membranes), brain (ventral striatum and brain stem), kidney, liver, spleen, colon, and the capillary endothelium of a variety of tumors. In the prostate, a cytosolic isoform termed PSMA' (produced by alternative splicing) is abundant in normal tissue; the membrane-bound PSMA-1 (prostate-specific membrane antigen, different from prostate-specific antigen PSA!) is found in primary prostate tumors. As physiological functions, GPPII\u29f8NAALADase I is required for the uptake of folate in the intestine, and in the brain it modulates excitatory neurotransmission through the hydrolysis of the neuropeptide N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), thereby releasing glutamate. PSMA is used as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator of prostate cancer and as a possible marker for various neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. GPPII\u29f8NAALDase I inhibitors have analgetic (Yamamoto et al., 2001) and neuroprotective effects (Williams et al., 2001). NAALADase II and III are similar to the former enzyme (Pangalos et al., 1999).",
