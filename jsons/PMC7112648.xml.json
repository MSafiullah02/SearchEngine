            "text": "Immunoglobulins (Igs) are glycoprotein molecules that function as antibodies and are only expressed in jawed vertebrates (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010). Typically, Igs compose two identical heavy (IgH) and two identical light chains (IgL). Both heavy and light chains can be divided into two regions, i.e., the constant region and the variable region, based on the variability of amino acid sequences. In general, the variable region recognizes antigens, whereas the constant region specifies critical effector or signaling functions, such as phagocytosis, binding Fc (fragment crystallizable) receptors and activation of complement (Schroeder and Cavacini et al., 2010). The classification of Igs is based on their heavy chain constant (IGHC) genes (Bengt\u00e9n et al., 2000). To date, several IgH isotypes, including IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA, have been identified in multiple vertebrates, and they are encoded by the IGHM, IGHD, IGHG, IGHE and IGHA genes respectively (Schroeder and Cavacini et al., 2010). Both IgM and IgD have been reported to be the most ancient IgH isotypes among jawed vertebrates, with IgM very conserved but IgD showing a high degree of structural and (presumably) functional diversity and even being lost in some species over evolutionary time (Sun et al., 2011; Ohta and Flajnik, 2006). IgG and IgE are both exclusively present in mammals (Bengt\u00e9n et al., 2000; Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010), the former being the predominant serum antibody and binding receptors on phagocytic cells and the latter predominantly functioning in immunity against parasites (Maizels, 2005). Additionally, IgA was found in reptiles first, with similar functions in all animals (Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010). Participating in mucosal immunity, IgA coats pathogens to prevent proliferation and defend against local infection (Macpherson et al., 2008).",

There are five main groups of extant marine mammals: Cetacea (dolphins, porpoises and whales), Sirenia (manatees, dugongs), Pinnipedia (walruses, sea lions and seals), polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and sea otter (Enhydra lutris) (Uhen, 2007). Cetacea and Sirenia are the only known completely aquatic mammals, and they appeared to return to the aquatic environment at approximately the same time, i.e. \u223c50 Mya (million years ago) (Uhen, 2010; Thewissen et al., 2007). In contrast, semi-aquatic pinnipeds, with a close relationship to Musteloidea, later transferred to water environment at \u223c28 Mya (Uhen, 2010; Flynn et al., 2005). Despite the independent evolutionary origins of these marine mammals groups, they have developed a series of specializations for aquatic lifestyles, such as loss of hair, thickened blubber, derivation of echolocation, and so on (Uhen, 2007).",

Recent studies have shown that cetacean TLR4 and MHC were subjected to adaptive evolution, particularly in the lineages with dramatic habitat transition (e.g. the lineage leading to hippo + whale representing the early stage of aquatic adaptation) or rapid radiation lineages such as extant dolphins (Shen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2016). However, the evolution of Ig in the aquatic adaptation of marine mammals remains poorly explored, except for a few reports about the cloning and sequencing of IGHC genes in bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) (Mancia et al., 2006, 2007; Lundqvist et al., 2002) and the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) (Breaux et al., 2017) and the identification of IgM, IgG and IgA and lineage-specific IGHG gene duplication in some cetaceans (Mancia et al., 2006), and so on. Therefore, in the present study, we first retrieved IGHC genes from the genomes of ten representative marine mammals. The genomic organization of IGHC cluster was identified and positive selection on the marine mammals was detected to address whether they experienced adaptive evolution in response to aquatic environments.",

The accession numbers of these sequences are compiled in Supplemental Table 1. Then we used IGHC sequences of these terrestrial relatives as a query to search for the orthologous genes from 10 marine mammal genomes with TBLASTN and BLASTN approaches, including bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), killer whale (Orcinus orca), Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocuena asiaeorientalis), baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), sperm whale (Physeter catodon), minke whale (Balaena acutorostrata), bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), and Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris). In addition, IGHC genes were also scanned from the genomes of three additional terrestrial mammals, i.e., hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), European shrew (Sorex araneus), and elephant (Loxodonta africana). The detailed information about the genome assemblies used in this study is given in Table 1\n. Finally, we checked whether the newly identified putative IGHC genes were their best hit by a blast search against the non-redundant database from GenBank. The newly identified IGHC genes were further separated into intact genes, partial genes and pseudogenes based on the amino acid alignment and blast results. The genomic coordinates of the newly identified IGHC genes are listed in Supplemental Table 2.",

In addition, positively selected sites were identified using Datamonkey, which incorporated the rate of synonymous substitution, whereas the d\nS was fixed in PAML. Three ML methods, i.e. the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed-effect likelihood (FEL), and random-effect likelihood (REL) implemented in the Datamonkey website (Pond and Frost, 2005a), were used to infer the positively selected sites with default settings and significance levels of 0.1, 0.1, and 50, respectively. Although SLAC, a conservative method, is suitable for large data sets, it usually underestimates the substitution rate. FEL method seems to capture the pattern of rate variation better than SLAC and REL, but it tends to be less conservative than SLAC to detect selection in data sets of intermediate size. REL approach is more powerful than SLAC and FEL, but it has the higher rates of false positives for small data sets (Pond and Frost, 2005a,b).

In addition, the branch-site model were conducted to detect evidence of positive selection on individual codon along a specific lineage (Zhang et al., 2005). In branch-site model, we compared Ma (positive selection, 0 < \u03c90 < 1, \u03c91 = 1 and \u03c92 \u2265 1) with Ma0 (neutral selection, 0 < \u03c90 < 1, \u03c91 = 1 and \u03c92 = 1) to detect positive selection. The significance of the differences between two nested models was tested using likelihood ratio tests (LRT) statistic (-2[LogLikelihood1-LogLikelihood2]) with a chi-square distribution. Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) approach (Yang et al., 2005) implemented in the CODEML was used to test the posterior probabilities (PPs) of positively selected sites, where sites with PPs > 0.90 were considered as candidates undergoing positive selection.

The phylogenetic relationship showed that the IGHC genes of marine mammals could be clustered well with those of their terrestrial relatives, suggesting that marine mammals possess the typical isotype repertoire as other eutherian mammals. Similar to other mammals, marine mammals were found to contain a single IGHM, IGHD, IGHE, and IGHA genes, and several IGHG genes based on the phylogenetic reconstruction. The order of IGHC genes in the IgH locus of marine mammals was determined to be 5\u2032-IGHM-IGHD-IGHG-IGHE-IGHA-3\u2032, which is in agreement with their terrestrial relatives (Supplemental Fig. 12). Furthermore, we found that the first domain (CH1) of IGHM and the CH1 of IGHD of cetaceans shared nearly identical sequences, as shown in artiodactylas (Zhao et al., 2002) (Supplemental Fig. 13).

The IgG-like Igs of chicken and lizard showed no subclass diversification (Butler et al., 2011). The gene duplication of IGHG genes is believed to have occurred most recently, and it belongs to a lineage-specific event (Wagner et al., 2002). In the present study, we found that there are usually two or four IGHG genes in marine mammals (Fig. 1). Like other mammals, the IGHG gene in marine mammals comprises three CH domains and a hinge segment. Furthermore, they have close sequence similarities to the IGHG genes in their terrestrial relatives. Based on the phylogenetic tree, it was found that IGHG genes within one species clustered together rather than with those of other species (Fig. 2). However, the IGHG genes of five species grouped together with their true orthologues in closely related species, including bottlenose dolphin, killer whale, Yangtze finless porpoise, Weddell seal and Pacific walrus, likely due to the species of Delphinidae (e.g., dolphin, killer whale) rapidly diverging during a very narrow time frame of \u223c3 million years (Zhou et al., 2011b) from the last common ancestral IGHG genes. These observations provided evidence to support the view that species-specific duplication of IGHG genes occurred during the evolution of mammalian species (Wagner et al., 2002). Overall, the presence of IgG subclasses and species-specific duplication of IGHG genes in marine mammals further confirmed the finding that IGHC genes of marine mammals fit the canonical pattern of their terrestrial relatives.",

For example, 2 IGHA genes were present in humans and platypuses (Mage et al., 2006), whereas 13 IGHA genes were found in rabbits (Mccallum et al., 2004). For IGHG genes, seven copies were found in horses (Wagner et al., 2004), five in humans (Takahashi et al., 1982), and only one in rabbits (Mage et al., 2006) and opossum (Wang et al., 2009). No IGHG gene was detected in the bowhead whale and little brown bat (Fig. 1), which may due to the bad genomic assembly of both species considering that IgG subclasses have been identified in other whales (Mancia et al., 2006) and partial sequence encoding of IgG in little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) was recovered by PCR (Butler et al., 2011). We also failed to retrieve IGHD genes from the genomes of sperm whale, hedgehog, European shrew, little brown bat, black flying fox and elephant despite considerable efforts (Fig. 1). One possible explanation is the poor genome quality, and the an alternative explanation is that the IGHD gene might have really been lost in evolution, similar to the situation in opossums (Wang et al., 2009) and rabbits (Mage et al., 2006). Further investigations to recover IGHD transcript by PCR will be needed in the future. Despite necessary further verification of IGHC genes in some species(e.g. with transcript evidence), changes in the copy number of IGHC genes among different mammalian lineages might reflect the rapid evolution of Ig genes (Hsu et al., 2006), corresponding to the marked variability found in the pathogens in different environments.",

            "text": "To detect the possible roles of positive selection during the evolution of IGHC genes in mammalian lineages, evolutionary analyses were conducted using a series of selection models implemented in the CODEML program and DataMonkey website. Because of the absence of intact IGHD genes in many mammals and the species-specific duplication of IGHG genes, only datasets of the IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes were used to test the selection. Site model analysis of all mammals revealed that the models incorporating positive selection (M8) fit the data significantly better than the neutral model (M8a) for both the IGHM and IGHA genes, whereas no evidence of positive selection was identified at the IGHE genes (Table 2\n). Specially, M8 model detected nine positively selective sites at the IGHM and IGHA genes, whereas a total of 39 codons from the IGHM, IGHE and IGHA genes were also found to be under positive selection using the FEL, REL, and SLAC methods implemented in Datamonkey. Eleven codons from three genes (5 in IGHM, 2 in IGHE, 4 in IGHA) were predicted to be robust sites under positive selection identified by at least two ML methods. Furthermore, TreeSAAP analysis showed that these 11 positively selected sites have undergone radical changes in their physicochemical properties (Table 3\n), and this may be regarded as another evidence to support significant positive selection. Then, we marked the putatively selected sites in the alignment and found that 36.4% (4/11) of these sites were located in, or close to, the functionally important regions of IGHC genes (Supplemental Fig. 14). This result suggested that positive selection on mammals may be the major driving force for the evolution of IGHC genes to adapt to environmental pathogens. Besides, for expanded subclasses, such as the 13 IGHA genes of rabbit and multiple copies of IGHG gene in mammals, we tested whether this species-specific expansion has been influenced by positive selection. The site model analysis (M8 vs. M8a, M1a vs. M2a implemented in PAML) showed that the IGHA genes of rabbits were under positive selection with similar positively selected sites (Supplemental Table 3). The branch-site model was used to examine whether some branches leading to gene duplication of IGHG genes (branch a-o) have been positively selected. The results showed that signals of positive selection were detected in branches a (Delphinoidea), c (Physeter catodon), e (Bos taurus), f (Sus scrofa), g (Equus caballus), and h (Macaca mulatta) (Supplemental Table 4, Supplemental Fig. 15). Overall, pervasive positive selection was detected on IGHC genes of mammals.",

By contrast, for marine mammal lineages, only the terminal branch of Florida manatee was subjected to positive selection (Fig. 1, Supplemental Table 4). This result supported that pathogenic pressure was weaker in aquatic environment than in terrestrial environment. Moreover, recent studies showed a very low number of variable genes that directly binds to antigens in marine mammals, which also supported this conclusion (Olivieri et al., 2014). But further study on the variable region will be needed, providing insights to understand whether the difference in selective pressure between marine and terrestrial mammals existed and whether such a difference could respond to the different pathogenic pressure between aquatic and land environments.",

However, they rarely display clinical symptoms (Zhang et al., 2013; Wang, 2009). The ability of bats to coexist with viruses presents an interesting immunological problem. Previous studies have founded that some immunoglobulin gene superfamilies underwent expansion in Brandt\u2019s bat (Seim et al., 2013) and that some positively selected genes were involved in the immune response (Zhang et al., 2013). Thus, IGHC genes subject to positive selection in chiropterans may be related to the long-term coexistence of bats and viruses.",
