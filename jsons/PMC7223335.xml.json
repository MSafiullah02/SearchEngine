Past research demonstrates several differences across veterans from different service eras, including physical and mental health symptom severity, although research using well-validated, broadband measures with protocol validity scales is lacking. Research using the MMPI-2 has found distinct sets of presentation concerns for those evaluated for PTSD that necessitated specific evaluation and treatment needs for not only PTSD, but also related physical health conditions. However, no similar investigations have occurred using the MMPI-2-RF, despite research supporting the improved psychometrics of its scales as well as its utility in assessing veteran relevant health constructs. Therefore, this study utilizes the psychometrically sound MMPI-2-RF to examine differences in symptomatology across the Vietnam and Gulf War service eras in a national sample of VA outpatients.",

We excluded patients who scored above the recommended validity cut-scores on the MMPI-2-RF as such scores indicate invalid responding and bias substantive scale elevations (Ingram et al., 2019b). We excluded individuals whose electronic medical records indicated that they did not serve in Vietnam or Gulf War periods.

Veterans from the Vietnam conflict were more likely to be married, male, and have 100% service connection.",

The validity scales of the MMPI-2-RF are effective at discerning feigned and actual symptoms but are sensitive to veteran status and veteran relevant issues (e.g., PTSD, neurological complaints; Ingram & Ternes, 2016). The interpretive manual of the MMPI-2-RF specifies the following scale scores as indicating probable patterns of invalid responding: VRIN-r \u2265 80, TRIN-r \u2265 80, F-r = 120, Fp-r \u2265 100, Fs \u2265 100, RBS \u2265 100, FBS-r \u2265 100, L-r \u2265 80, and K-r \u2265 70. Additionally, profiles may have compromised scale validity if an insufficient number of items are scorable (CNS \u2265 15). The remaining 42 substantive scales measure various clinical constructs and are structured hierarchically. These substantive scales include 3 Higher-Order construct scales, 9 clinical scales referred to as the Restructured Clinical (RC) scales, 23 specific problem scales, 2 interest scales, and the scales of the Personality Psychopathology 5 (PSY-5). Included within the 23 specific problem scales are 5 scales assessing explicit health-related concerns: Malaise (MLS), Gastrointestinal Complaints (GIC), Head Pain Complaints (HPC), Neurological Complaints (NUC), and Cognitive Complaints (COG). Scores on the substantive scales are measured using standardized uniform T scores, with a score of 65 equating to approximately the 92nd percentile.",

These specialty PTSD clinic treatment teams utilize evidence-based treatments and assessments for trauma-exposed individuals, most of whom meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD (e.g., 89\u201391%; Glenn et al., 2002; Mozley et al., 2005). In this way, study participants were those identified by VA providers as warranting evaluation due to reported trauma exposure. Likewise, those identified as having trauma exposure are likely to experience substantive health-related concerns (El-Gabalawy et al., 2018). Because of the nature of service era coding within the VA electronic medical record system, the Gulf War period includes those individuals in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation New Dawn (OND), and the Gulf War.",

In this subset of analyses, Gulf War Veterans scored slightly higher than Vietnam War Veterans on Gastrointestinal Complaints (d = .25), Head Pain Complaints (d = .31), Anxiety (d = .24), and Disconstraint (d = .21). In contrast, Vietnam War Veterans scored slightly higher than Gulf War Veterans on the Neurological Complaints (d = .26) and Multiple Specific Fears Scales (d = .37).

Earlier research found service era differences for veterans evaluated on the MMPI-2 that suggested different interpretive and treatment needs within the VA healthcare system (Glenn et al., 2002). Results from this study suggest four trends that are relevant for the use of, and research with, the MMPI-2-RF: (a) veterans assessed are generally homogeneous in their report of average symptom severity across service eras as significant scale differences are uncommon, (b) the magnitude of effect is small in instances where mean differences emerge, (c) patterns of symptom differences between eras on the MMPI-2-RF differ from the MMPI-2 and most differences reflect non-PTSD diagnostic concerns (i.e., somatic/cognitive complaints), and (d) service era differences are more identifiable when the frequency of clinical elevations (T \u2265 65/T \u2265 75) is compared.",

These differences in elevation frequency are most observable on the Specific Problems (i.e., somatic/cognitive, internalizing, externalizing, and interpersonal) and PSY-5 Scales, rather than the Higher-Order and Restructured Clinical Scales. These differences were particularly pronounced for scales assessing constructs relevant to behavioral health settings, and those associated with trauma exposure. Vietnam veterans endorse Gastrointestinal Complaints (GIC) and Head Pain Complaints (HPC) less frequently; however, Neurological Complaints (NUC) are more common. A greater frequency of elevated NUC scores is consistent with an aging population that is more likely to experience neurological concerns, including problems with balance, motor coordination, and increased sensory problems. Those who served during the Gulf War had higher AXY and DISC-r, consistent with a more disinhibited and externalizing presentation. Such a presentation may partially reflect a developmental trajectory, especially for DISC-r, which captures elements of impulsivity that is higher among younger populations. Those scales also reflect a more severe exposure to trauma as many relate to core PTSD criteria (AXY; Sellbom, Lee, Ben-Porath, Arbisi, & Gervais, 2012) and the course of symptom presentation (DISC-r; Sadeh, Miller, Wolf, & Harkness, 2015).",

While research documents a consistent relationship between PTSD and physical health concerns (\u00c5kerblom et al., 2017; Pacella et al., 2013), substantial health-related differences do not emerge as a function of service era. Accordingly, this may be understood within the framework that the health issues common to those being evaluated for PTSD are a general response to disorder arousal symptoms (El-Gabalawy et al., 2018) and do not stem from specific service era or deployment experiences (e.g., rates of concussive force exposure, Agent Orange, or Gulf War Syndrome). This has direct clinical implications because the current MMPI-2-RF VA comparison groups do not include Gulf War veterans but can, nonetheless, be used with individuals of this service era. An ability to generalize findings across service eras is critical to improving assessment veracity, and subsequent treatment recommendations, as the MMPI-2-RF is widely used within the VA in a variety of healthcare services and clinic types (e.g., Ingram et al., 2019a; Russo, 2017).",

Alternatively, past research indicates that SUI scores are increased by the presence of potentially life-threatening medical problems (Tarescavage e al., 2013), which may explain why SUI elevations were more common among the older Vietnam veteran population. Nevertheless, clinicians should continue being mindful of the potential for suicidal risk\u2014particularly within aging veterans. More generally, primary care settings appear to provide an optimal service location in which to regularly conduct those suicide screenings within the VA healthcare setting (Ashrafioun et al., 2016; Oslin et al., 2006) and the MMPI-2-RF has documented utility within various medical settings (Forbey et al., 2012; Ingram et al., 2019a), including for spinal surgery and bariatric evaluations (e.g., Block, Ben-Porath, & Marek, 2013; Marek et al., 2012).",

As noted earlier, Glenn et al. (2002) examined MMPI-2 scores and found that Gulf War veterans endorsed higher rates of hypomania, whereas Vietnam veterans reported greater rates of depression, anxiety, and social isolation. Conversely, in this study there were no meaningful differences in these areas across service eras. These differences may reflect the improved discriminant validity of the MMPI-2-RF scales. Additionally, whereas Glenn and colleagues\u2019 investigation of the MMPI-2 utilized a single over-reporting scale to exclude invalid protocols, we utilized all nine MMPI-2-RF Validity Scales. As such, substantive score comparisons in this study are much less influenced by response bias differences across service eras.",

First, although a very high percentage of individuals in PCT teams meet criteria for PTSD (approximately 90%; see Glenn et al., 2002; Mozley et al., 2005), the individuals assessed as part of this study were not screened for PTSD or other psychiatric diagnoses. Accordingly, it is possible that, to a small extent, scores comparisons vary across groups as a function of their diagnostic presentation. Additionally, veteran age, as well as additional deployment information (other than service era), was not available, which would have been beneficial in identifying service-related experiences and how they may mediate symptom presentation. Finally, only self-report information was available for the current study. It would have been useful to further compare differences in symptom presentation on the MMPI-2-RF as well as clinician-rated structured interviews. Notwithstanding these limitations, this study\u2019s 7-year national sample provides a comprehensive evaluation of service-era differences and offers supplemental understanding about what considerations are important during assessments within the VA healthcare system.",
