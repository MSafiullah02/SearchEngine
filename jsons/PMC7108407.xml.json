            "text": "Recent advances in the study of functional glycomics in living organisms have received a great deal of attention [1\u2022\u2022]. Carbohydrates, presented in the form of glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, or other glycoconjugates, have long been known to play important roles in a variety of biological processes. They participate in molecular recognition events such as cell adhesion, migration, and metastasis; host\u2013pathogen interactions such as bacterial and viral infections; and initiation of the immune response [2]. Despite the increased awareness of the important function of carbohydrates, the study of carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions is difficult. This is largely because of the structure complexity of carbohydrates, and the low affinity of their interactions with glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) \u2014 typically the monomeric K\nD values are in the micromolar to millimolar range, thus biological responses are often because of multivalent display and interaction of these glycans [3]. Carbohydrates are generated cotranslationally/post-translationally through a nontemplated synthetic process, which involves over 200 glycosyltransferase genes, whose differential expression and combined specificities contribute to the complexity and diversity of carbohydrate structure.",

Not all of these possibilities exist in nature, but the current list of known N-linked and O-linked glycans found in proteins contains more than 2000 structures [9]. Therefore, the construction of the complete array of an entire glycome on a single chip is a major challenge. The recent development of new methods for chemical and enzymatic synthesis of oligosaccharides will increase the complexity and utility of carbohydrate arrays [1\u2022\u2022, 5\u2022]. The discovery of uncharacterized natural glycans is another challenge, typically achieved by the extraction from natural sources of glycoproteins or glycolipids. A novel technology has recently been developed and used to modify sugar for detecting specifically glycosylated structures on cells. Alkynyl sugar analogs were attached to the cellular glycans through biosynthesis, and the modified glycans were detected by click chemistry with an azido fluorgenic probe or biotin handles [10]. Application of proteomic methods to the metabolically engineered cells has allowed for the identification of new glycoproteins and glycans (GIDmap) [11\u2022]. This glycoproteomic method will allow for a complete analysis of a subset of the glycoproteome, and for the differential comparison between cancer and normal cells for differences in glycosylation pattern.",

In the landmark studies by researchers at the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (www.functionalglycomics.org), a comprehensive array of more than 200 glycans on a glass slide was used to analyze the specific binding of mammalian, plant, viral, and bacterial lectins [15\u2022\u2022]. Recently, Gildersleeve and coworkers used a glycan array that contained 73 different glycans to do the high-throughput analysis of 24 lectins [16]. Carbohydrate specificity profiling of the C-type lectin macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) revealed that the lectin specifically recognized terminal \u03b1-linked and \u03b2-linked GalNAc moieties. This result led to the postulation that the expression of Tn antigen (GalNAc-\u03b1-Thr) by tumors might modulate the host immune response via the interaction of Tn with C-type lectin, such as MGL [17].",

The first microarrays of heparin-like glycosaminoglycans have been constructed by Seeberger and coworkers to tackle this problem [18\u2022]. Heparin oligosaccharides on the arrays were incubated with the acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (FGF-1 and FGF-2) and it was found that FGF-1 not only interacted with the hexamer and tetramer of heparin oligosaccharides but also with the unusual 2,4-O-sulfated monomer, which may become important for inhibitor design. The Hsieh-Wilson group reported the use of a chondroitin sulfate microarray to probe the specificity of TNF-\u03b1 [19], as well as midkine-derived and brain-derived neurotrophic factor [20\u2022]. The tetrasulfated tetrasaccharide CS-E was found to react strongly with these growth factors within the physiological concentration range. A brain neuron growth experiment confirmed that the CS-E motif stimulated neurite outgrowth by about 50% [20\u2022]. It is anticipated that these microarrays will accelerate the understanding of glycosaminoglycan\u2013protein interactions and pinpoint the sulfation patterns responsible for modulating physiological and disease states. These microarrays also provide valuable structure information for the design of inhibitors or antagonists of these therapeutically important cytokines and growth factors.",

            "text": "Most pathogens contain specific polysaccharides on their cell surfaces, which can elicit antibody responses in infected humans. Microbial polysaccharide microarrays can be used for the diagnosis of pathogen infection by analyzing patient serum samples. Several examples of this application are described below (Figure 2\n). In an application with relevance to AIDS vaccine development, glycan arrays were used to dissect the glycan-binding specificity of the HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 2G12 [21\u2022, 22\u2022]. An array of oligomannose structures was analyzed against 2G12, and a minimal binding element was identified. Smaller oligomannose structures (Man4) were found to be as effective as the Man9GlcNAc2-high mannose core at binding to 2G12 and inhibiting complexation with HIV gp120. These results may lead to the development of potential HIV vaccines by the synthesis of polyvalent derivatives of these oligomannose core structures. Wang et al. discovered that rabbit IgG antibodies elicited by Bacillus anthracis spores specifically recognize a rhamnose tetrasaccharide chain that decorates the outermost surface of the B. anthracis exosporium [23]. This tetrasaccharides appear to be a key biomarker for the detection of B. anthracis spores and may guide the development of novel anthrax vaccines. The same group used the glycan arrays to characterize the carbohydrate-binding activity of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies induced by an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine and found potential crossreactivity between the immune response to an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine and a host carbohydrate [24]. Blixt et al. reported an array containing oligosaccharide antigens specifically expressed by serogroups Salmonella enterica sv. Paratyphi, Typhimurium, and Enteritidis [25]. This microarray was used to detect the sera from patients with salmonellosis. Disaccharides (Tyv\u03b11-3Man, Abe\u03b11-3Man) and trisaccharide (Man\u03b11-2Rha\u03b11-2Gal) were found to have high-specificity serological recognition. By using the same strategy, a polysaccharide microarray was prepared by immobilizing bacterial polysaccharides to detect bacterial infection by using human or animal serum sample [26, 27]. It is obvious that glycan array applications in this field may facilitate the identification of key immunogenic carbohydrates expressed by microbial pathogens.",

Virus entry into host cells is initialed by HA binding to cell surface sialic acid-containing glycans, which vary in structure based on the host species and anatomical location. Binding of HA variants recovered from pandemic and circulating strains on a 260-member glycan array demonstrated differences in the recognition of carbohydrate linkages (\u03b12,3 or \u03b12,6 sialic acid, characteristic of avian or human virus, respectively), sulfation and fucosylation. Remarkably, pandemic 1918 HA switched specificity to human epithelial cells, a change from \u03b1-2,3 to \u03b1-2,6 NeuAc-Gal-binding preference with only two amino acid substitutions.

Eighty-five synthetic compounds were incubated with FucT and GDP-Fuc on a LacNAc-coated microtiter-type microarray and then detected by peroxidase-coupled T. purpureas lectin. Four inhibitors with nanomolar K\ni were discovered [39]. The technique was further improved by using a glass slide glycan array to test several monosaccharides to inhibit the binding of surface-coated mannose with Con A [40\u2022\u2022]. Recently, an aminoglycoside microarray platform has been developed for directly monitoring and studying antibiotic resistance [41, 42]. This type of array will be a useful tool for the discovery of new antibiotics that evade resistance.

Although qualitative assessment of binding by this method is useful, using fluorescence intensities to quantify binding affinities might be misleading. Values are highly variable from batch to batch because the spot intensities depend on immobilization efficiency. Recently, the Wong lab has developed a quantitative method to assess the binding affinities between carbohydrates and proteins (Figure 3\n) [40\u2022\u2022]. A series of protein concentrations were incubated with repeated subarrays which contained several carbohydrates to get surface dissociations (K\nD,surf). A similar strategy was also reported to determine the dissociation constant of \u03b1-LacNAc and \u03b2-LacNAc for RCA120 [43]. By varying the printing concentration of glycans, multivalent interactions were probed. Higher density printing generally led to lower observed K\nD,surf, indicating a multivalency effect which mimics the multivalent display of glycans on cell surfaces. Furthermore, solution dissociation constants (K\nD) were determined by the competition between carbohydrates or inhibitors in solution-bound and surface-bound glycans. It is envisioned that this method will be useful for the quantitative characterization of sugar-binding specificities of proteins and for the high-throughput discovery of inhibitors of carbohydrate-binding proteins of therapeutic interest.",

Enzymatic conversion of GlcNAc to LacNAc by GalT was detected by fluorescence lectin. Recently, the method was extended to profile 20 carbohydrates as GalT acceptors [43]. Maltose derivatives were covalently conjugated on the microtiter-type glycan array and glycosylation products were detected by FITC-labeled Con A. New acceptor substrate specificities of glycosyltransferase were observed [45]. Owing to the limitation of lectins as detection tool (low-binding specificities and weak affinities), a broad spectrum of detection method was developed to study various recombinant sialyltransferase specificities. The donor substrate cytidine-5\u2032-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) was biotinylated at the 9-position of Neu5Ac. After screening of a series of sialyltransferase against a +200 member glycans microarray, the sialylation products were observed with fluorescein-streptavidin to determine acceptor substrate specificities [46]. Similarly, GDP-[14C]Fuc was transferred to surface carbohydrates on an array using plant cell wall glycosyltransferase [47]. Arrays have proven to be powerful tools for high-throughput profiling of the substrate specificities of carbohydrate-processing enzymes.",
