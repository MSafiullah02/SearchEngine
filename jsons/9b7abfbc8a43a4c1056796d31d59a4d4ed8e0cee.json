However, little appears to have been known about the biology and life history of this remarkable small antelope species; for example, in a renowned paper on the behaviour of antelopes, Jarman (1974) did not know how to classify the social behaviour of this species. Detailed descriptions of the biology of Beira antelope have only occurred very recently (Hammer & Hammer, 2005; Giotto et al., 2008) . Beira antelope originate from East Africa; their area of distribution is the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden to the Horn of Africa in the east, to the borders of Somalia, Ethiopia and Djibouti in the west, and to the Marmar Mountains in northeastern Ethiopia (K\u00fcnzel & K\u00fcnzel, 1998; Nowak, 1999; Heckel et al., 2008) . Their typical habitat is arid mountain with sparse vegetation, where they inhabit altitudes of up to 2000 m in small, territorial groups (Giotto et al., 2008; C. Hammer, pers. obs) . Beira antelope belong to the Neotragini, the dwarf antelopes, and are considered related to the Steenbok Raphicerus campestris and grysbok (Raphicerus spp), the dikdiks (Madoqua spp) and the Oribi Ourebia ourebi. The scientific name Dorcatragus megalotis is of Greek origin and means 'big-eared antelope' (Huffman, 2009) .",

Most animals died because of malnutrition, heat, and parasitic and infectious diseases. From before 1999, no detailed records exist about the number of imported animals and their fate. In March 1999, 25 Beira antelope were captured during an expedition to Somalia (in the area of Hargeisa) and flown to Qatar. At this time, 1.3 (<.,) animals were still alive at AWWP from previous expeditions. By July 1999, only 2.6 adult animals were still alive and these represent the founding stock for the current AWWP population: the only ex situ population to date. Descriptions presented here are based on observations of this population and on free-ranging animals during a field trip to Djibouti in 2003.",

Beira antelope calves are hiders (remain hidden and separated from their mother except during nursing periods) and are visited by their mothers for nursing only. The placenta is usually ejected 30-60 minutes after birth and directly ingested by the mother; however, only partial consumption or complete neglect of the placenta also occurred at AWWP.

At AWWP, Beira antelope drink regularly and are observed to drink more frequently during the hot summer months. Three times per week a phosphorus supplement is dissolved in the drinking water, because the phosphorus status of many animals at AWWP was found to be low (Hammer et al., 2006) . Even after extensive experimentation with different products, the acceptance of the mineral licks offered remains limited; some animals have never been observed using them.",

The < is never separated from the group but breeding << are exchanged based on their age, health and genetic representation in the population. It is thought that a low neonate mortality (17%) and a high success in raising juveniles (96% of surviving neonates) advocates the use of these small breeding units. There was only one case of a , that consistently neglected its offspring. The breeding < dominates the group. The ,, have a hierarchy but this is difficult to discern in established groups. Offensive actions between ,, are rare and mostly observed when an animal of a group dies or a new animal is introduced into the group. At AWWP, new adult ,, are not added into existing groups. Female offspring replace their mothers in breeding groups. However, if a , had to be isolated for medical reasons, reintroduction into its former group may be necessary and is always a challenge. After a period of visual and olfactory contact through a wire fence, the newcomer is first introduced to the lower-rank ,, of the group. The dominant , is only brought to the group after an indeterminate time period; in some cases, the dominant , had to be removed repeatedly before the group was stable. Such integration takes 2-3 weeks to achieve. If a completely new group has to be assembled, it is advisable to put all animals into an enclosure that is not familiar to any member of the group, to avoid giving any individual an advantage.",

Individual animals even take food from the hands of keepers. Enclosures are nearly always entered by keeping personnel with animals present, with the exception of work that results in high noise production, such as tree felling. Different methods for the capture of individual Beira antelope have been tested at AWWP over the years. Hiding neonates up to 7 days of age are captured by hand, using a towel to cover the eyes. Older animals are pushed along a corridor with a blanket, which is put over the animal at the end of the corridor; usually, the animal lies down at once and can be restrained through the blanket. At the end of such a corridor, which can also be formed of canvas, the animal can also be pushed into a transport box (90 cm \u00c2 40 cm \u00c2 70 cm high), in which routine procedures, such as vaccinations or blood sampling, can be performed. If chemical immobilization is necessary, a regime of ketamin (1 \u00c1 8 AE 0 \u00c1 6 mg kg \u00c0 1 ) and medetomidin (0 \u00c1 060 AE 0 \u00c1 008 mg kg \u00c0 1 ) antagonized by atipamezol (0 \u00c1 34 AE 0 \u00c1 04 mg kg \u00c0 1 ) delivered intramuscularly has been used successfully (Martin Jurado et al., 2007) .",

Main symptoms are nasal discharge, coughing and eye infections, with arthritis in some individuals. During necropsy, fibrinous pleuropneumonia, kidney abnormalities and amyloidosis are evident. We know today that the cause of FPPS is a mycoplasma infection , most likely without the involvement of a viral infection (Lechenne et al., 2009) .

Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The syndrome led to a crash of the captive population (Fig. 7) . The most recent neonates are left with their mothers but are treated continuously with antibiotics during their first 2 months of life. To date, these animals do not show any symptoms.
