This strong partnership between the ASP team and laboratory has been extremely fruitful and has resulted in many successful initiatives to improve patient care. In addition, this collaboration has been helpful to address the challenges of assimilating new outpatient and inpatient clinical facilities into our rapidly expanding health care system. These challenges include finding solutions for the integration of diverse existing susceptibility reporting cascades, infectious diseases testing practices, antimicrobial formularies, and ASPs for newly assimilated hospitals and clinics.

However, there are barriers in developing antibiograms to serve multiple locations in a health system.

This technique identifies an unknown organism by analyzing the proteins present, separating them according to mass, charge, and the time it takes for each of the proteins to travel from the inoculation site to the detector end of the instrument. Based on these parameters, the instrument generates a protein spectrum that is then compared with the spectrums included in the database of the instrument.12\n,\n13 The main advantages of MALDI-TOF are the speed and accuracy for identifying microorganisms. The instruments have high performance characteristics and robust databases to identify the most common organisms isolated from clinical specimens.14 Overall, identification is achieved 2 to 24 hours earlier for gram positives, and 24 to 72 hours earlier for gram-negative rods and yeasts compared with traditional systems of identification.13\n,\n15 Furthermore, MALDI-TOF is able to accurately identify fastidious or difficult to identify organisms that laboratories were previously unable to identify with conventional identification methodologies. The reporting of unusual organisms that are occasionally identified by MALDI-TOF can have unintended consequences because clinicians may be unfamiliar with the organism reported or with their potential pathogenicity and this can potentially lead to unnecessary antimicrobial treatment. Consultation with our ASP team is recommended for assessment of reporting language in the medical record and how clinicians might respond to a Staphylococcus epidermidis result as compared with a \u201ccoagulase-negative staphylococcus\u201d report. Studies have shown that rapid identification of an organism by MALDI-TOF can improve time to appropriate antibiotic treatment, but only when associated with ASP collaboration.16, 17, 18, 19\n",

We studied the impact of panel implementation for patients with noncontaminant gram-positive bacteremia and found improvements in AS metrics as shown in Fig. 1\n. These improvements were attributed to the shortened time to organism identification and the ability to detect resistance. Median time to identification improved by 29 hours. Implementation of the panel also improved stewardship metrics for patients with blood cultures positive with a likely contaminant. For patients with blood culture contaminants, our study demonstrated a reduction in days of antibiotic therapy, shorter length of hospital stay, and fewer tests for vancomycin levels.",

Initially it was mostly used for the diagnosis of influenza, but it quickly became a useful tool for assessing patients with other respiratory infections. Currently, the laboratory uses a multiplex PCR assay that includes 15 respiratory viruses and four bacterial pathogens. To begin with, microbiology and stewardship staff positioned the RVP for use in immunocompromised patients or those with moderate to severe respiratory infections needing hospitalization. Tests could be ordered without preauthorization or other restriction. Over time, the volume of ordered RVPs has substantially increased, with the maximum volume observed during the months of influenza activity. The high cost of the test and escalating RVP volume underscores the importance of diagnostic stewardship and prudent use of this test. In addition, test performance depends on collecting proper nasopharyngeal swabs and physicians and nurses should be trained on the procedure.",

Results of the study showed that providers were more likely to discontinue or de-escalate antibiotics if the RVP is positive (Table 4\n). Hospital length of stay and attributable mortality was not changed. Microbiology and stewardship teams need to balance improved stewardship metrics associated with the test with its cost and high volume burden to the laboratory. Thus, although the escalating cost of RVP testing is concerning, it may be offset by reduced antibiotic expense and improved use.

However, the published evaluation of the performance of this panel showed false positives particularly for Streptococcus pneumoniae.35 A false-positive result may not only lead to unnecessary therapy, but more importantly, false-positive results may delay or halt the pursuit of the true diagnosis.36 In addition, providers should be aware that the sensitivity for detection of the different pathogens included in the panel varies considerably. For this reason, at WFBH when suspecting herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, particularly in neonates, we recommend ordering the stand-alone HSV PCR test in cerebrospinal fluid, which has higher sensitivity than the HSV target included in the meningitis/encephalitis panel (MEP). The main benefit of the MEP is the rapid result, which could help to select appropriate therapy and prioritize resource use. In addition, it has been useful for the determination of whether droplet isolation or secondary chemoprophylaxis is required for Neisseria meningitis. Because of the potential for false-positive results and the possibility for the detection of latent or reactivated viruses, results from MEP must be carefully assessed. At WFBH, MEP orders are not routinely processed on specimens with less than 50 WBC/dL unless approved by a consulting infectious disease or AS team member.

Growing concerns regarding overdiagnosis of CDI led us to evaluate CDI diagnoses at WFBH in 2015. Clinical specimens submitted for PCR testing were tested concurrently with an EIA that simultaneously tests for C difficile antigen and toxin. Members of the ASP performed chart review for each patient and made assessments of the likelihood of CDI while blinded to the EIA results. The analysis showed that the EIA was a better predictor of CDI and confirmed our suspicion of overdiagnosis by using PCR alone. The evaluation also identified common reasons for diarrhea that led to unnecessary CDI testing, many of which were iatrogenic.
