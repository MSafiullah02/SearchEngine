It may pass or may define a \"new normal\" over a variable period and might force us to turn our united and undivided attention as a global nuclear medicine community to address the global health of our specialty jointly. The severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes (coronavirus disease-2019 or COVID-19 for short) have been the topic of much discussion in the nuclear medicine [1] and radiology [2] literature. Since the first reports of the new virus emerged from China in late December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020. WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [3] ; it has swept the globe, with no respect for national boundaries, causing widespread infections, mortality, human suffering, and upending lives in all socioeconomic groups. Governments around the world have rushed to implement measures aimed initially at containing the spread of the virus, but after that, mainly at slowing the COVID-19 spread and mitigating the impact of the virus on local healthcare systems and supply chains. Despite this, there is significant heterogeneity in the degree of success of the various measures, in keeping with differing political, sociological, and economic factors around the world.",

There has been a steady fall in the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 [8] at the initial epicenter in Wuhan. With this gradual decrease in numbers, emergently opened hospitals have been closed, and those that were designated as COVID-19 centers have returned gradually to their routine operation. Some semblance of normalcy has returned to life, with the lifting of the lockdown. In other areas, timely and successful measures were implemented, thus allowing for staggering the number of new cases over a more extended period, allowing health systems to care for patients properly without collapsing.",

Hospitals and other healthcare facilities all over the world were forced to postpone elective procedures, such as surgeries. The treatments of many pathologies had to be adjusted, and many diagnostic procedures were postponed. Nuclear medicine departments needed to adapt their standard procedures to continue providing essential services while minimizing the risk to staff [8] , patients [9] , and family members, as well as controlling the transmission of the virus, thus allowing essential services in every aspect of nuclear medicine practice, ranging from SPECT/CT, PET/CT, and radionuclide therapy to continue. In a short time, several publications were made available, describing the experience of centers or providing advise [9, 10] on how to operate during COVID-19 pandemic [1] . With this collective experience, we are hopefully better prepared to meet the challenges of this or even future pandemics and adjust to the new normal. This pandemic also presents us with a unique opportunity to review our patient flow and optimize or adapt the use of research and development tools such as artificial intelligence.",

Each country's stage in the curve may be radically different, even within the different regions of the same country, and there may be very rapid changes in the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in a matter of days to weeks. One of the measures implemented by most departments based in hospitals is postponing routine elective scans while continuing to provide priority procedures [11, 12] , to reduce the potential risk of transmission [10] .",

The knowledge and learning acquired now will be useful in dealing with any future outbreaks of human-to-human transmitted diseases, if and when they arise. There is acknowledgement of the psychological impact on staff by COVID19 [13, 14] . Social distancing measures may remain in place or maybe relaxed gradually, depending on the situation. Whatever the case, psychological support for staff should be prioritized, and good communication within the nuclear medicine department should continue even once COVID-19 has abated. Some nuclear medicine staff may have been split into teams working in separate shifts to minimize the fallout if anyone of them is infected [15] . This shift system can be reversed as the threat of infection reduces, to deal with the expected surge in patient numbers when lockdowns are lifted. Given the ramping up of COVID-19 testing in many countries, easy access to antigen and antibody SARS-CoV-2 testing should be available to all staff groups, especially if the workload increases.",

However, many departments now use alternatives such as pharmacological stress and perfusion SPECT/CT, and there may be an impetus in the future to evaluate the accuracy of such options in preparation for potential new pandemics or second waves of infection. Radionuclide therapy patients are kept in isolation due to restrictions on radiation safety. Resuming services, where currently restricted, is more of a logistical challenge rather than a danger to the health of the patient. In some situations, adapted procedures approved by regulatory authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., allowing treatment of patients at home, subject to strict protocols) may potentially be continued if ongoing approval is granted. These arrangements will be dependent on local regulatory agencies, but proactive discussions with these agencies may result in longer term flexibility for outpatient treatments.",
