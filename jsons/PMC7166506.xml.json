            "text": "Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) continues to challenge clinicians with its widespread prevalence and multi\u2010agent aetiology, including several newly emerging pathogens, and occasional but persistent occurrence in appropriately vaccinated dogs. The commonly accepted CIRD clinical scenario, often referred to as \u201ccanine cough\u201d or \u201ckennel cough\u201d, involves primary infection with canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV\u20102), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) or Bordetella bronchiseptica, typically resulting in a relatively mild, self\u2010limiting syndrome in uncomplicated cases. When co\u2010infections are involved, CIRD can progress to a more severe and protracted disease (Erles et al.\n2004, Ettinger & Kantrowitz 2005, Ellis et al.\n2005, Buonavoglia & Martella 2007). Although multi\u2010factorial infection often occurs in CIRD, Bordetella bronchiseptica by itself has been found to cause clinical respiratory disease, (McCandlish et al.\n1978, Ellis et al.\n2001), and is generally considered to be the single most prevalent and important CIRD pathogen despite its usual role as a commensal agent (Keil & Fenwick 2000, Ford 2009).",

            "text": "In addition to these traditional CIRD pathogens, other infectious respiratory agents have been identified, either as newly emerging pathogens or as demonstrated contributors in cases of clinical disease. These include canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) [Erles et al.\n2004, Ellis et al.\n2005, Buonavoglia & Martella 2007; Decaro et al.\n2008, Erles & Brownlie 2008, Knesl et al.\n2009], canine influenza virus (CIV) [Crawford et al.\n2005, Buonavoglia & Martella 2007, Barrell et al.\n2010, Harder & Vahlenkamp 2010, Holt et al.\n2010], canine herpesvirus type 1 (CHV\u20101) [Erles et al.\n2004, Buonavoglia & Martella 2007], and the bacterial pathogens Mycoplasma cynos and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (Chalker et al.\n2003, Chalker et al.\n2004, Chvala et al.\n2007, Pasavento et al.\n2008, Mannering et al.\n2009, Priestnall & Erles 2011, Priestnall et al.\n2011). More recently, a novel canine bocavirus (Sun et al.\n2009, Kapoor et al.\n2012, Pratelli & Moschidou 2012, Li et al.\n2013) and a previously unrecognised pneumovirus (Renshaw et al.\n2010, Renshaw et al.\n2011) have been isolated from dogs with clinical respiratory disease as well as from asymptomatic dogs, often in cases of co\u2010infection with other respiratory viruses. The relative importance of these newer agents and their role in CIRD is not well understood (Renshaw et al.\n2010, Pratelli & Moschidou 2012, Li et al.\n2013), nor are they included in current commercial PCR pathogen assays. Given the evolving epidemiological landscape associated with CIRD, a current epidemiologic survey of CIRD pathogens and their relative prevalence in the US dog population would be useful information for clinicians and animal health scientists.",

Shelters were located in states in the West (three in California and one each in Arizona and Colorado), Midwest (one in Indiana), and East (two in Florida and one each in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina). Diagnostic samples were obtained from clinically normal dogs presented at the shelters from December 2011 to May 2012, prior to their introduction to the resident shelter population. A total of 503 dogs were tested, 50 dogs from each of nine shelters, 35 dogs from a 10th shelter, and 18 dogs from an 11th shelter. Vaccination status of the study population was unknown. All dogs included in the study were asymptomatic and clinically healthy when admitted to the shelter. Dogs were excluded if they had any overt sign of disease, including inappetence, dyspnoea or other respiratory signs, signs of wasting, keratitis, oral ulceration, conjunctivitis or a rectal temperature above 38.6 C (101.5 F). Dogs were also excluded if they were below 1 year of age or did not have full adult dentition, were transferred from another shelter or were known or suspected to have been recently vaccinated. There were no restrictions for gender, breed or neutering status. Diagnostic samples were obtained before the dogs were introduced into the general shelter population or were vaccinated or treated therapeutically at the shelter.",

Only one of the CDV\u2010positive dogs had a quantitative PCR indicative of active infection (>1million CDV RNA particles per swab), confirming that the dog was incubating CDV despite being asymptomatic at presentation (Elia et al.\n2006). A follow\u2010up call to the shelter revealed that the dog died of clinical canine distemper 2 weeks after the swab was taken. No other dogs had quantitative PCR values indicative of active infection and no other follow\u2010up calls were made to assess clinical disease progression. This study focused on the PCR test results of dogs at admission to shelters and did not include a plan to follow these animals over time.
