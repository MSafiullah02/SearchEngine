            "text": "Approximately 43% of emerging human parasites and pathogens originate in wildlife (Jones et al. 2008). In recent decades, a growing acknowledgement of the role of wildlife diseases in human health has prompted research on pathogens that have directly or indirectly jumped from wildlife to humans, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, West Nile virus and various influenza viruses resulting in a rapid increase in the understanding of disease ecology (Hudson et al. 2002; Wobeser 2007; Ostfeld, Keesing & Eviner 2008). Further impetus for disease ecology research stems from wildlife diseases that afflict domestic animals and cause economic losses due to direct mortality, farm\u2010wide culling and trade restrictions, as seen with classical swine fever, foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease, bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis (Keeling et al. 2001; Schnyder et al. 2002; Woodroffe et al. 2006; Cross et al. 2007).",

            "text": "In addition to impacts on human health and economies, wildlife diseases are increasingly recognized as a conservation challenge. Formerly, it was widely thought that pathogens would not cause extinction because as host population density decreased due to disease, contact rates would become too low for transmission to continue; thus, pathogens would be extirpated before host populations (Anderson & May 1979). However, disease\u2010induced declines and extinctions of wildlife resulting from small population sizes, reservoir hosts, host switching and heterogeneity in contact rates, susceptibility and transmission within and among populations have forced a re\u2010evaluation of this perspective (de Castro & Bolker 2005). For example, when contact rates among individuals do not depend on host density, pathogens are more likely to drive populations to extinction because transmission continues as host populations are reduced, as seen with Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii (Boitard 1841) facial tumour disease where transmission appears to be related to mating behaviours (McCallum 2012). White nose syndrome in bats also seems to be more likely to cause extinctions owing to social behaviours in which hosts cluster in hibernacula, reducing the correlation between contact rates and population densities (Langwig et al. 2012). In recent decades, wildlife disease management (WDM) has been increasingly used to conserve threatened wildlife populations (Deem, Karesh & Weisman 2001). For example, WDM has controlled outbreaks of feline leukaemia in critically endangered Iberian lynxes Lynx pardinus (Temminck 1827) and rabies in endangered Ethiopian wolves Canis simensis (R\u00fcppell 1840), both of which are associated with domestic animal disease reservoirs (Haydon et al. 2006; L\u00f3pez et al. 2009).",

This is unlike other environmental management disciplines such as fisheries ecology, which has effectively used theoretical models to predict yields, manage harvest timing and limits and design reserves (e.g. Gerber et al. 2003). Indeed, theoretical applications in fisheries ecology have also produced insights into density\u2010dependent population dynamics, metapopulation theory and the evolution of life\u2010history strategies (Frank & Leggett 1994). In this review, we assess the extent to which a similar union between theory and practice has been achieved in WDM.",

We then present methodological and conceptual opportunities to facilitate the newly emerging synthesis of disease ecology and management, drawing from environmental management and biomedicine to outline steps towards more cost\u2010effective, efficacious and informative WDM.

To investigate differences in theory application and objectives among managing groups, we also classified author affiliations for each paper as academic, governmental, private or some combination thereof.

Finally, we considered whether the original management objective was attained using the following categories: \u2018apparent success\u2019, meaning that there was no unmanaged control population or area to compare to the treated area; \u2018partial success\u2019, meaning that at least some of the management objectives were reported as fulfilled; and \u2018success,\u2019 for cases that had controls and reported fulfilment of all management objectives.

Some theoretical concepts such as density dependence in transmission were frequently applied, while others such as pathogen evolution and the role of predators and biodiversity in regulating disease were not (Fig. 3, Table 1). Unexpectedly, papers authored by academics were not more likely to incorporate theory (Fisher's exact test, P = 0\u00b7909). Management outcomes were related to theory incorporation (Fisher's exact test, P = 0\u00b7042). The three papers that reported disease increases following intervention explained their results in terms of disease ecology theory, providing insights into transmission and optimal control strategies (e.g. Cross et al. 2007; Fig 2b). However, there was no relationship between management objective attainment and theory incorporation (Fisher's exact test, P = 0\u00b7746). Nevertheless, some counter\u2010intuitive but successful management programmes clearly benefited from theory. For example, control of classical swine fever in wild boar Sus scrofa (Linnaeus 1758), is often hampered by stage\u2010dependent transmission dynamics. Susceptible piglets are hard to target with baited vaccines and act as disease reservoirs. By allowing an epidemic to peak such that most adults are immune, then culling only piglets, Swiss academics and governmental groups successfully eradicated the disease from a 166\u2010km2 region near the Italian border (Schnyder et al. 2002).",

In our experience, theoreticians prefer simpler, more general models that may be applicable to many systems. These models are easier to parameterize and analyse, and the resulting papers are likely to have a wider academic audience. On the other hand, simple models are easily discarded by managers because they lack system\u2010specific detail. This tension is likely to continue, but we recommend additional flexibility on both sides. In particular, managers should appreciate that the addition of modelling details that are only weakly supported by data may not lead to better predictions. Meanwhile, theoreticians may develop general models that bear little resemblance to any biological system. Furthermore, individuals may be most interested in a particular suite of theoretical concepts, but a narrow approach can impede management by ignoring the full range of phenomena relevant to producing desired management outcomes (Driscoll & Lindenmayer 2012).

These efforts were mandated despite uncertainty over transmission dynamics, the environmental persistence of prions that cause CWD and the time of CWD arrival to the state (Bartelt, Pardee & Thiede 2003). Five years later, prevalence was still slowly increasing (Heisey et al. 2010).

Indeed, some have pointed out that application of theory under certain circumstances can lead to poor management (Driscoll & Lindenmayer 2012). Misapplication of theory at an inappropriate scale, or in a system that does not meet necessary assumptions, could cause undesired consequences. For instance, an assumption of broad\u2010scale culling as a disease management intervention is that pathogen transmissions scale positively with host population density. However, density\u2010dependent changes in social behaviour can alter dispersal patterns that violate this assumption, increasing transmission, as seen with bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle and European badgers Meles meles (Linnaeus 1758) (Woodroffe et al. 2006). Work in the badger\u2013TB system has refined our understanding of the effects of culling on social animals. However, one could argue that if culling\u2010induced dispersal had been discovered in another disease system, the unintended increase in TB transmission to cattle following badger culling might have been avoided. Unfortunately, had this been the case, the applicability of the social perturbation\u2013transmission increase phenomenon to the badger\u2013TB system would have remained uncertain. This underscores the value of moving beyond a case study\u2013dominated paradigm, towards a rigorous and empirically verified contingency\u2010based understanding of theory applicability to disease management. Such a framework could test and refine theoretical concepts that have shown promise in model systems, but have been infrequently applied in the WDM literature (Fig. 3).",
