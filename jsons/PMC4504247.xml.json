In the event of resource scarcities and excess demands, access to care will be restricted, and the level of care will be altered (see \u201cSurge Capacity Principles\u201d article by Hick et al1 in this consensus statement). Overall, this involves a shift from individual patient-based medicine to population-based medicine. The requirement to restrict and alter standards of medical care inherent in the shift to population-based medicine is perhaps one of the most challenging transitions for clinicians to make in delivering critical care to an overwhelming number of patients. Addressing these issues during the planning and training process is essential to ensuring appropriate use and stewardship of resources during a disaster.",

The suggestions in this article should assist hospital disaster planners, medical education societies, and public health systems in the engagement of critical care clinicians in ICU disaster preparedness. Although it is important for all providers to be familiar with all aspects of the critical care response to a pandemic or disaster, Table 1\nprovides an overview of the suggestions of most interest to each group.",

This requires rapid activation of vertical communication networks within hospitals as well as a horizontal flow of information among hospitals; nongovernmental organizations; and local, regional, and national public health jurisdictions to adequately respond to the event. Although many systems allow collection of regional information (eg, bed availability), facilitate resource management, or permit information sharing through electronic health records, few systems focus on ICU clinician engagement with subject matter experts and incident command leaders in pre-event planning and disaster response. Although this can be facilitated quickly on a regional level, defining participants, platforms, and goals ahead of time should substantially improve clinician acceptance, effectiveness, and engagement.",

These concerns are surmountable but will require substantial stakeholder development, buy-in, and collaboration. Once the curriculum is developed and endorsed, then the larger issue is how the curriculum will be disseminated and evaluated in health-care settings. The thresholds for disaster preparedness are fairly low for the predominant hospital accrediting agency in the United States, The Joint Commission, so many hospitals may not implement such highly specialized training.

Extensive public health system efforts toward community engagement on this topic inform the following suggestions.85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94\nFigure 2\nillustrates an approach that was used successfully in Harris County, Texas.94 Community engagement sessions in the United States on the topic of mass critical care and the allocation of scarce resources reveal that the American public has a great deal of confidence in medical providers to make sound clinical decisions during a crisis; however, the public believes that end-of-life care decisions should be made by the patient's family. This fact will require continued clinician and public conversation because during a pandemic or disaster, neither group will have ultimate control over allocation decisions.93\n",

Key community partnerships involve volunteer, faith-based, and nongovernmental community-based clinicians. Once these partnerships are established, it is important to share best practices and models that communities have undertaken to address MCC. The practices then should be implemented and deployed to engage families and, thus, effectively provide guidance during resource allocation situations. Particular attention should be given to especially vulnerable populations, such as those with specific functional needs and those who have historically been marginalized.99, 100 Although the task force suggests that critical care providers need to be actively involved in community engagement initiatives, no clear mechanism to ensure these opportunities exists.",
