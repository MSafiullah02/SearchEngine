            "text": "Nasal administration has emerged as a promising and attractive route for vaccination, especially for the prophylaxis of respiratory diseases. Our previous studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus-like particles (VLPs) can be assembled using a recombinant baculovirus (rBV) expression system and such VLPs induce specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice after subcutaneous injection. Here, we investigated mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV VLPs in a mouse model. Mice were immunized in parallel, intraperitoneally or intranasally, with VLPs alone or with VLPs plus cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG). Immune responses, including the production of SARS-CoV-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), were determined in mucosal secretions and tissues. Both immunizations induced SARS-CoV-specific IgG, although the levels of IgG in groups immunized via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route were higher. sIgA was detected in saliva in groups immunized intranasally but not in groups immunized intraperitoneally. CpG had an adjuvant effect on IgA production in genital tract washes when administered intranasally but only affected IgA production in faeces samples when administered intraperitoneally. In addition, IgA was also detected in mucosal tissues from the lung and intestine, while CpG induced an increased level of IgA in the intestine. Most importantly, neutralization antibodies were detected in sera after i.p. and intranasal (i.n.) immunizations. Secretions in genital tract washes from the i.n. group also showed neutralization activity. Furthermore, VLPs that were administered intraperitoneally elicited cellular immune responses as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay analyses. In summary, our study indicates that mucosal immunization with rBV SARS-CoV VLPs represent an effective means for eliciting protective systemic and mucosal immune responses against SARS-CoV, providing important information for vaccine design.",

            "text": "To prevent another SARS epidemic, continuous efforts have been made towards the development of a prophylactic vaccine. Most of the currently used antiviral vaccines are based on homologous inactivated or attenuated viral particles. However, reversion of an attenuated live vector to a virulent strain by genetic recombination cannot be excluded, precluding the use of this strategy for many pathogens. 6 Virus-like particles (VLPs) represent a specific class of subunit vaccine that mimics the structure of authentic virus particles. VLPs are safer than inactivated or attenuated viral particles and are more likely to stimulate stronger immune responses than single protein-based vaccines. 7 Systems for constructing VLPs have been well explored in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), rotavirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human papillomavirus (HPV). [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Currently, VLPs as an antigen presenting and delivery system are under investigation in preclinical studies or clinical trials against different human viruses. For example, an effective HPV VLP vaccine was developed and has been used in clinical trials. [15] [16] [17] Given the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV, VLPs represent a potential option for SARS vaccine development. We and others have recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV VLPs can be assembled by coinfection with recombinant baculoviruses (rBVs). 18, 19 We also investigated the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV VLPs after administration via subcutaneous injection in mice and found that SARS-CoV VLPs activated immature dendritic cells and enhanced the expression of costimulatory molecules and the secretion of cytokines in vitro. 20, 21 In addition to the systemic immune responses, mucosal immune responses inducing local antibodies are critical because the mucosa is often the portal for inhaled antigens. To date, intranasal (i.n.) immunization is emerging as possibly the most effective route for vaccination. Because the transmission route of SARS-CoV is through the mucosal membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth, 2 a vaccine to achieve mucosal immunity should be considered as the primary goal for SARS vaccine development. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV VLPs when administered through the mucosal route. Our data demonstrate that intraperitoneal (i.p.) and i.n. immunization with VLPs, with or without a cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) adjuvant, elicit both systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice.",

To date, a variety of candidate vaccines, such as DNA, 27 adenovirus-mediated, 28 a combination of whole killed virus and DNA, 29 inactive virus 30 and recombinant proteins or their fragments are under preclinical or clinical study. In addition, VLPs, morphologically mimicking the native virus and capable of eliciting strong immune responses, represent a safe option for vaccine design. We previously reported that SARS-CoV S and N DNA vaccines evoked humoral and cellular immune responses when administered through different vaccination routes. 31 We also documented that SARS-CoV VLPs could be formed using a baculovirus expression system, and specific SARS-CoV IgG and T helper type 1 (Th1)-based cellular immune responses were achieved after subcutaneous injection of high doses (100 lg) of VLPs into mice. 21 Because the route of administration of an immunogen, and other variables, such as frequency, dose and timing, could influence the immune response, 32 in this study we evaluated the immunogenicity of non-replicating VLPs administered at a low dose (20 lg) by mucosal routes and investigated the effects of CpG as an adjuvant. Our results indicate that VLPs administered via i.p. or i.n. routes induced specific serum IgG, although the antibody titre was lower in the i.n. immunization group (Fig 1) , while CpG had little effect in terms of enhancing the IgG response. Additionally, sIgA was detected in mucosal secretions and tissues. A detectable sIgA response existed in genital tract washes and in faeces samples from animals in the i.p. groups immunized with VLPs plus 10 lg of CpG adjuvant. Mucosal immunity is mainly mediated by sIgA and has been shown to be effectively induced by i.n. immunization. CpGs are potent systemic and mucosal adjuvants in mice and were shown to be potent adjuvants for antigens delivered intranasally. [33] [34] [35] Interestingly, we found that CpG induced lower IgA production compared with antigen alone in the genital tract after immunization via the i.p. route. However, the difference was not statistically significant.",

However, the effects in mice may be more dramatic than those in humans and the way in which the antigen is taken up may be different as a result of the nature of the antigen. Before the development of VLPs as an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV in humans, it needs to be addressed whether the i.n. immunization in mice corresponds to the i.n. immunization in humans.",
