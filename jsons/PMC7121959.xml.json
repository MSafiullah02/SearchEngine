There are numerous agents with potential toxic effects on the lungs including cytotoxic and noncytotoxic drugs. Common causes of drug-induced lung disease include chemotherapeutic agents, amiodarone, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There are a number of recognized cofactors that may enhance the likelihood of a pulmonary drug reaction, particularly reactions associated with chemotherapeutic agents. These include advanced age, prior radiotherapy, and elevated inspired oxygen levels; the presence of any or all of these factors increases the likelihood of developing a pulmonary drug reaction. Surgery may even be a precipitating event (Camus et al. 2004a).",

In the Berlin definition, a differential diagnosis between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic edema on chest radiograph is not required, nor it is considered relevant: it is now recognized that hydrostatic edema and ARDS may coexist. The diagnosis of ARDS requires that the respiratory failure is not fully explained by cardiac failure, or fluid overload, using all available data (Ferguson et al. 2012). Therefore, radiologically, the focus is on the generic diagnosis of bilateral edema that must not be confused with pleural effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules/masses. In fact, HPE is not the only condition with which the ARDS goes in differential diagnosis: bioptic and autoptic studies have demonstrated only moderate agreement between the clinical diagnosis of ARDS and presence of DAD.

At present, it is thought that there are two pathogenic stages that follow one another: the mechanical phase and the biochemical phase (Akhtar 2009). The mechanical phase occurs after release of fat droplets into the venous blood, which determine mechanical obstruction of the pulmonary and systemic capillary bed. The following biochemical phase is due to the toxic effects of free fat acids (FFA) on the endothelia. It is unclear how fat droplets reach systemic circulation: likely they pass through a patent foramen oval or through the pulmonary capillary bed.",

Alveolar flooding appears with over 25\u201330 mmHg, resulting in the radiological appearance of confluent acinar opacity (Morgan et al. 1991; Ketai and Godwin 1998). It is important to remember how the radiographic picture depends also from the acuteness or chronicity of heart failure: edema in acute heart failure is determined by lower pressure gradients, but may not show at chest X-ray dilatation of the heart and of the vessels. On the contrary, chronic heart failure determines an increase in the compliance of the heart and of the pulmonary vessels, and higher pressures are required to determine vascular dilatation (Ketai and Godwin 1998).",
