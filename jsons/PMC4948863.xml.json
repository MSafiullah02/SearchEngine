Early detection of potentially high\u2010risk pathogens within animal hosts or vectors could enable mitigation strategies to prevent a species jump to humans, such as avoidance of high\u2010risk areas, prophylactic drug distribution or timely mobilization of surveillance and medical resources to cope with emergent disease. However, our understanding of host\u2013pathogen ecology and evolution is not yet sufficiently robust to allow us to recognize the patterns, processes and mechanisms that predicate species jumps. In the future, persistent surveillance in animals could detect changes in viruses that precede a species jump and allow mitigation or prevention of human infections. The prospects for predicting infectious disease outbreaks have been reviewed and discussed by several authors (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2001; Childs, 2004; Wolfe et al., 2005; Holmes and Drummond, 2007; Parrish et al., 2008; Childs and Gordon, 2009; Pulliam and Dushoff, 2009; Pepin et al., 2010).

Species\u2010jumping viruses may (or may not) have been able to cause sporadic human infections during spillover events.

By contrast, predictive surveillance efforts aim to identify ecological conditions (e.g. climate, vegetation, land use) that precede animal and human outbreaks and can provide timely warning to human populations (Ostfeld et al., 2005; Anyamba et al., 2009). Both spillover events and species jumps have historically been revealed by public health surveillance. A limited number of surveillance efforts, such as those undertaken by the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative and the EcoHealth Alliance, attempt predictive surveillance for species jumps by seeking underlying ecological drivers. Like the viruses they target, predictive surveillance efforts are emergent, and there are numerous obstacles, both technical and organizational, that challenge their development.",

Despite high mutation rates, the genetic diversity of HA is constrained. This limited diversity is evident in HA phylogeny, which shows high extinction rates that result partly from cross\u2010immunity between similar strains. That is, many HA mutants go extinct because they fail to spread efficiently from host to host because of immunity in previously infected individuals. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain how competition between closely related strains interacts with other factors to limit the observed diversity of HA and NA. One hypothesis suggests that short\u2010term, strain\u2010transcending immunity may limit the growth and mutation of influenza strains (Ferguson et al., 2003). Another hypothesis is that punctuated antigenic changes in HA may precipitate selective sweeps, allowing sufficiently novel mutants to outcompete related strains of the same subtype (Koelle et al., 2006). This process has been termed \u2018epochal evolution\u2019, as the discovery of new antigenic phenotypes depends on periods of extensive genotypic change with generally minor but occasionally dramatic effects on phenotype.",

            "text": "How are the patterns of seasonal influenza in humans useful to predict species jumps? Understanding the dynamics of influenza in human hosts sheds light on the potential of the human population to be infected by new strains, the probability that a spillover virus can acquire evolutionary adaptations to facilitate spread in humans and the abilities of intermediate hosts (such as chickens and pigs) to generate pandemic viruses. Seasonal influenza creates cycles of higher and lower immunity in humans: epidemics deplete susceptibles, leaving a higher fraction of the population with protective immunity. Some of this immunity has been shown to be cross\u2010protective against viruses of other subtypes (e.g. infection with seasonal influenza can confer partial protection to infection with H5N1). In addition, the diversity of viruses circulating in humans should in theory correlate with the potential for an emerging virus to exchange gene segments with an adapted resident virus, which could increase the emerging virus\u2019s rate of transmission. Reassortment events are commonly associated with seasonal influenza and appear to be an integral evolutionary step in pandemics. The generation of pandemic viruses through reassortment depends sensitively on dynamics in the intermediate host population, including the amount of herd immunity in non\u2010human hosts and the dynamics of viral diversity in that host population. Compared to humans, pig populations can contain a much greater diversity of H3N2 viruses, including antigenic variants of H3 HA that have long been extinct in the human population (de Jong et al., 2007), but the rate of viral antigenic evolution in pigs is slower. As with humans, an important question is how host immunity, local climate, viral mutation and birth/death processes affect the observed patterns of influenza diversity. Understanding these basic processes should allow the long\u2010term effects of interventions (e.g. culls, quarantines, antivirals and vaccinations) on viral evolution to be predicted and shed light on which steps (such as key mutations or contact rates between hosts) (Cobey et al., 2010) limit emergence.",

Shortly after its detection in humans, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza A virus (A/H1N1pan) was determined by phylogenetic analysis to have arisen from combinations of viruses that previously infected human, swine and avian hosts (Dawood et al., 2009). Subsequent animal studies revealed host\u2010specific differences in virulence among A/H1N1pan strains \u2013 that is, animal species (mice, ferrets, macaques) were affected differently depending upon the strain with which they were infected (Memoli et al., 2009). These pathotype variations suggest that for a given A/H1N1pan strain, different species are more or less susceptible to infection and/or develop different immune responses that diminish or worsen outcomes of infection, leading to species\u2010specific differences in morbidity and mortality. Despite fears, A/H1N1pan has exhibited a global mortality rate of far <1%, compared with an estimated 2.5% for 1918 pandemic influenza A virus (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006; Bautista et al., 2010). Smith et al. (2009), utilizing a Bayesian molecular clock analysis of swine\u2010origin influenza virus (S\u2010OIV) outbreak strains, estimated that the A/H1N1pan common ancestor emerged between August 2008 and January 2009. Additional retrospective analyses may help reveal how sentinel cases during this time frame went unnoticed. The possibility that A/H1N1pan emerged up to 8 months before detection illuminates the uncertainties, opportunities and risks accompanying the current zoonotic viral surveillance vacuum.",

That virus was clearly shown to be a descendant of a cat virus (feline panleukopenia virus, FPV) that jumped from cats to dogs within 5 years prior to its emergence. Since that time, CPV\u20102 has continued to evolve, and in one of those steps, it re\u2010acquired the ability to infect cats while continuing to evolve within its canine host. Phylogenetic analyses reveal changes in amino acid residues on the surface of the viral capsid proteins. Although those are single\u2010stranded DNA viruses, they show high levels of variation, similar to those seen for RNA viruses. Parrish et al. have shown that many of the genetic differences between CPV and FPV associated with host range variation occur in these capsid protein genes, resulting in a tropism shift that enabled the species jump from cats to dogs. They further characterized the viruses structurally and showed that they differ in their antigenicity and exhibit species\u2010specific differences in attachment to the host cell receptor (transferrin receptor type 1) (Harbison et al., 2009). In case of the FPV\u2010to\u2010CPV jump, genotypic changes (likely about five mutations) gave rise to the changes in the viral capsid that enabled the new virus (CPV\u20102) to bind to the transferrin receptor in the canine host.",

When plotted on a global map, the areas at greatest risk for zoonotic pathogen emergence (\u2018hotspots\u2019) were the equatorial tropics. (By contrast, the most intensive EID research and surveillance efforts were concentrated in temperate zone countries.) These investigators and others (Kuiken et al., 2005) suggest that surveillance efforts can be rationally focused both geographically and based on income.

Also, one human case was acquired from a rabbit that became infected when exposed to a prairie dog in a veterinary setting. In this case, rodents commercially captured in forested areas of southern Ghana were the sources of the US outbreak, and a 2010 study by the US CDC found that 53% of nearby human residents had been previously exposed to orthopox viruses (Reynolds et al., 2010).

Furthermore, geographic information system\u2010based maps that layer environmental measurements (temperature, precipitation, land use) and vector/host distribution data can be used to inform rational decisions about when and where surveillance samples should be collected.

Prediction requires inputs derived from many disparate bioscience fields (virology, ecology, evolutionary and computational biology, immunology, veterinary science, wildlife biology, etc.) that have little history of collaboration or current impetus to do so. No single field can accomplish the required research, obtain the desired knowledge or develop actionable models on its own. Transdisciplinary collaboration can push experts and funding agencies outside their default zones and create opportunities for progress. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that practitioners in required fields like entomology have steadily declined, while newer fields like modelling and informatics still have too few trainees.",

A transdisciplinary permanent working group could encourage and promote orthogonal approaches to key research questions, including: Can laboratory viral adaptation in animals or cell cultures be used to model species jumps? What evolutionary drivers underlie species jumps by wild\u2010type viruses? What human host factors and polymorphisms ameliorate or exacerbate viral pathology?",

To that end, current spillover surveillance efforts could be leveraged. For example, plans could be made to process and share currently collected virus samples with multidisciplinary teams for longitudinal genomic analyses. To conduct predictive surveillance in the long term, practitioners must lay the groundwork for optimizing surveillance efforts in the short term to include laboratory analyses that can detect tropism shifts or other changes that may preclude species jumps.",

The emergence of A/H1N1pan in North America highlights the uncertainties and challenges in predicting whether spillover events can lead to species jumps \u2013 yet, understanding the sources of new viruses is critical to understanding how they emerged. The extant zoonotic viral surveillance vacuum (Smith et al., 2009) relegates the power of sequence and phylogeny\u2010based analytics to the reactive realm of outbreak reconstruction. There is an urgent need for pervasive surveillance capability at nodes of disease emergence.
