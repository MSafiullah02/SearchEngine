Most deaths were attributed to complications related to sepsis, ARDS and multiorgan failure,\n8\n which occurred commonly in the elderly with comorbidities. There were notable differences in case\u2010mix among different regions (i.e. differences in distribution of age, sex, disease severity as reflected by surrogate markers such as LDH level, proportion of infected healthcare workers (HCW) and the proportion of SARS confirmed by virological tests). The CFR of HCW in Hong Kong was 2% (8 out of 386). It is noteworthy that in the United States, only 8 out of 47 probable cases and none of the 162 suspected cases have had virological confirmation of SARS\u2010CoV infection.\n10\n The variation in CFR across different regions has to be interpreted in the light of these differences.\n11\n\n",

Similarly, a study at 6\u20138 weeks after hospital discharge in 43 patients at the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases showed that forced vital capacity and total lung capacity were mildly decreased at 85 \u00b1 11% and 81 \u00b1 8% of predicted, respectively, and residual volume was markedly reduced at 63 \u00b1 10% of predicted, while carbon monoxide diffusing capacity corrected for lung volume (DLCO/VA) was normal at 109 \u00b1 18% of predicted.\n17\n The findings suggested that respiratory muscle weakness rather than parenchymal lung damage was the major factor for the restrictive lung function defect. In addition, 50% of the patients from the QEH series have a decrease in hand grip strength. The observed weakness of respiratory and skeletal muscle could be due to several factors, including the previous use of high dose steroids, prolonged bed rest, physical deconditioning or residual systemic effect of the acute disease.",

It is assumed this psychological aftermath will probably improve over time, as suggested by data from another series of 75 patients in QEH who were evaluated at one to two months after hospital discharge. Only 5% of these patients were reported to have moderate to severe anxiety and depressive symptoms (A Au, pers. comm.).
