            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first identified in 2012 in patients with severe respiratory disease in Jordan and Saudi Arabia.1 Since its discovery, approximately 1600 cases have been reported, amounting to about 40 cases per month. While this number is low, the worrisome features of the disease are its propensity to cause severe disease in patients with underlying conditions, including diabetes, renal disease, lung disease, or an immunocompromised state, and its apparent ability to readily spread within hospital settings.2 In addition, MERS-CoV has been identified in camel populations throughout the Arabian Peninsula and Africa,3, 4, 5 and epidemiological evidence suggests that it is periodically introduced into human populations.6 Further, coronaviruses have a well-described propensity to mutate and recombine.7 Consistent with this propensity, the genomic sequence of MERS-CoV has changed since it first entered human populations in 2012, but these changes have not enhanced the ability to effect human-to-human transmission.8 This lack of increased transmissibility is encouraging, but, on the other hand, the continued introduction into human populations from infected camels coupled with coronavirus mutability means that measures to prevent infection are important to develop anticipatorily.",

Most often, the latter approach involves passive or active immunization, which will be discussed in this review. Efforts to prevent MERS by immunization are based in part on the extensive information gained from studies of coronavirus vaccines used to prevent infections in domesticated and companion animals. Additionally, a key piece of information required for the rational design of vaccines is knowledge of a protective immune response. Immune responses to some non-human coronaviruses have been characterized and these responses are also described below.",

The N terminal S1 fragment of the S protein binds to the host cell receptor, elicits neutralizing antibody, and perhaps not surprisingly, is also the part of the virus that is most variable between isolates.12 This variability explains why neutralizing antibodies are generally virus strain-specific and do not provide cross-reactive protection against even closely related coronaviruses.13 On the other hand, coronavirus-specific CD8 and CD4 T-cells recognize epitopes from across the genome, some of which are in conserved proteins, which do not readily undergo mutation.",

These studies showed that virus clearance from infected mice required the development of an effective T-cell response. Both CD4 and CD8 T-cells were required for optimal kinetics of clearance.14 The studies also showed that the T-cell response could be immunopathological.14, 15, 16 Thus when irradiated mice or mice lacking T- and B-cells were infected with a strain of MHV that causes demyelination, the mice developed minimal clinical disease and showed no evidence of demyelination. However, within a few days of receiving virus-specific T-cells, severe myelin destruction occurred, along with hind limb paralysis. Neutralizing antibodies were also important in immune protection, serving at least two roles. First, in the absence of neutralizing antibody, MHV was cleared to very low levels by T-cells, but later recrudesced, resulting in lethal disease.17 Second, virus-specific antibodies were most important for protecting mice against further challenge. Of note, immune protection was long-lived in immunocompetent mice that survived experimental infection with MHV, possibly because the infection was systemic, involving the central nervous system, or in some cases, the liver.",

This is most evident in studies of patients or human volunteers infected with respiratory coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43.18, 19 These viruses generally cause mild upper respiratory tract disease and only rarely cause severe disease. In human volunteer studies, the presence of pre-existing anti-HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-229E antibodies did not provide protection against experimental challenge with the same virus, in terms of clinical disease or virus titers. Similarly, experimental challenge provided only partial protection against subsequent re-challenge and this protection waned over several months. In these studies, systemic antibodies were generally measured, so less is known about the levels of IgA, which are likely most important for protection against viruses that remain confined to the upper respiratory tract.",

While only a few SARS survivors have been followed longitudinally, anti-SARS-CoV antibody titers were not detectable after 6 years.21 Longitudinal studies of T-cell responses in these patients are even fewer in number, but T-cell responses were detected at low levels in some survivors.21, 22, 23, 24 While these data suggest that coronavirus-specific T-cells are more likely to persist than B-cells, it is still possible that there are sufficient numbers of residual memory T- and B-cells to protect patients from infection or severe disease on rechallenge.",

A vaccinia virus-based vaccine expressing the FIPV surface (S) glycoprotein was developed, and was shown to induce high levels of anti-FIPV neutralizing antibody.29 However, this anti-S antibody was not protective against challenge with virulent FIPV. Rather, it induced an antibody-dependent accelerated and enhanced disease after challenge.

Mice are not naturally infectable by MERS-CoV because the virus cannot use the mouse MERS-CoV receptor (dipeptidyl peptidase, DPP4) to enter cells. In this instance, mice were sensitized to MERS-CoV by prior transduction with an adenovirus engineered to express human DPP4 (hDPP4).40 In another approach, fully human antibodies with MERS-CoV neutralizing activity were developed using mice that expressed human antibody heavy and \u03ba light chains. In this study, efficacy was examined in mice that had been engineered to express hDPP4 in lieu of mDPP4 (\u2018knock-in\u2019, KI mice).41 The humanized anti-S mAbs accelerated virus clearance and reduced pathological changes in mouse lungs.",

These viruses were shown to be attenuated and to induce protective humoral and cell-based immune responses in hamsters and mice after SARS-CoV challenge.51, 52, 53 Further investigations showed that this vaccine was not genetically stable, with partial duplication of the transmembrane (M) protein detected upon repeated passage. Remarkably, this genetic change resulted in re-acquisition of a PDZ binding motif (PBM) important for protein\u2013protein interactions.54 If the E protein was only partially deleted so that the PBM was retained, the virus was genetically stable, attenuated, and immunogenic. In another approach, virus mutated at the catalytic site of a protein critical for genome fidelity during replication (nsp14) resulted in an attenuated virus that did not revert upon repeated passage in cells and mice, was safe even in highly immunocompromised mice, and induced a strong anti-S antibody response.55 Further efforts to maximize the biosafety of these live attenuated vaccines include the introduction of additional mutations into non-essential proteins or into non-coding regions of the genomic RNA, which minimize the likelihood of a virulent virus arising after recombination with circulating coronavirus strains.56, 57\n",

Camels were immunized with an orthopoxvirus vector (modified vaccinia virus Ankara, MVA) expressing the S protein.76 After challenge with MERS-CoV at 3 weeks after boosting, clinical signs (rhinitis) and infectious virus titers in the upper respiratory tract, the main site of replication in the camel, were diminished in immunized compared to control animals.",

First, an important consideration is whether humans or, alternatively, camels should be vaccinated. Humans but not camels develop severe respiratory disease, but only a relatively small total number of infected individuals have been identified and many of these have had co-morbidities, which would impair vaccine responsiveness. In the absence of a greater disease burden in human populations, it seems unlikely that human vaccination would ever be economically viable. On the other hand, a high percentage of camels are infected with MERS-CoV and vaccination reduces virus load, although without inducing sterilizing immunity. The longevity of the camel immune response is not known but may be short, since camels appear to be readily re-infected with MERS-CoV. Further, the large size of camels plus the number of camels potentially requiring immunization would cause logistical problems.",

The receptor binding part of the S protein, the target for most neutralizing antibodies, is the most variable part of the S protein so that antibodies are highly strain-specific. While the S protein of MERS-CoV has not shown evidence of mutations that result in antibody evasion, this is still a possibility because coronaviruses are prone to mutation and recombination. Thus, targeting the S protein may provide protection against MERS-CoV but may not be useful against either a closely related strain or one that evolves in response to immune or other pressure in humans. This possibility was highlighted in a recent study that showed that two bat strains of SARS-like CoV were closely related to human SARS-CoV and used the same ACE2 receptor to enter cells.77, 78 However, anti-SARS-CoV S antibodies could not neutralize one of these strains.78\n",
