            "text": "The types of approved viral vaccines include live attenuated viruses, killed/inactivated viruses, and conjugate/subunits. However, these types of vaccine technologies may prove unsuitable against some viruses. In some cases, there is interest in the development of short peptide vaccines to fi ll the gaps. For example, the use of live attenuated HIV-1/AIDS vaccines is not as yet approved due to safety concerns [ 1 ] . There are several subunit vaccines under consideration and evaluation. However, one of these, the NIAID and Merck Co.-sponsored 2004 STEP (HVTN 502 or Merck V520-023) trial using three recombinant adenovirus-5 (rAD5) vectors containing HIV-1 genes Ad5-gag, Ad5-pol, and Ad5-Nef, did not show promising results [ 2 ] . This has led to the development of a multifaceted strategy for HIV-1/AIDS vaccine development. However, encouraging results were observed with four priming injections of a recombinant canary pox vector (ALVAC-HIV) and two booster injections of gp120 subunit (AIDSVAX-B/E) in a community-based, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled effi cacy trial (NCT00223080) in Thailand [ 3 ] . The main concern following this study was that this vaccine did not affect the degree of viremia or the CD4 T-cell count in patients who later seroconverted. Further studies indicated that the challenges with the development of an HIV-1/AIDS vaccine are viral diversity and host-virus molecular mimicry [ 4 -6 ] . Nonetheless, there is considerable amount of interest to develop gp160 (gp120-gp41 complex) TRIMER envelope (ENV) protein as a potential vaccine candidate [ 4 ] .",

The number of known HLA alleles is over 12542 in number as of March 2015 at the IMGT/HLA database [ 11 ] . Hence, a number of methods have been formulated so far and optimized for HLA-peptide binding prediction during the last two decades. Structural information on HLA-peptide complexes has increased our understanding of their binding patterns (Tables 1.1 and 1.2 ) . The HLA-binding groove is structurally similar among class I (Fig. 1.1a ) and class II ( Fig. 1.1b ) alleles. The class I (Fig. 1.1c ) and class II (Fig. 1.1d ) bound peptides do not show an identical binding pattern at the groove. A detailed illustration of peptide binding patterns (Fig. 1.2 ) at the groove of class I and class II alleles provides valuable insights using mean and deviation profi les ( Fig. 1.3 ) . Tables 1.1 and 1 .2 ). The peptide lengthwise distribution of the binding pattern is shown as relative binding measure using change in solvent-accessible surface area upon complex formation with the HLA groove A comprehensive description of HLA-peptide binding prediction is documented [ 14 , 15 ] . Lee and McConnell [ 16 ] proposed a general model of invariant chain association with class II HLA using the side-chain packing technique on a known structural template complex with self-consistent ensemble optimization (SCEO) [ 17 , 18 ] using the program CARA in the molecular visualization/modeling software LOOK (Molecular Application Group (1995), Palo Alto, CA) [ 16 , 19 ] . This was an important development in the fi eld and the approach was extended to a large dataset of known HLA-binding peptides. Kangueane et al. [ 20 ] collected over 126 class I peptides with known IC 50 values from literature with defi ned HLA allele specifi city. These peptides were modeled using available templates for a large-scale assessment of peptide binding to defi ned HLA alleles. Thus, a structural framework was estab- Fig. 1.3 The mean peptide binding pattern with standard deviation (SD) at the groove is illustrated as function of residue position for class I and class II alleles using a dataset (Tables 1.1 and 1.2 ) of HLA-peptide complexes (67 class I and 16 class II) retrieved from protein databank (PDB). This provides insight into the understanding of the nature of peptide binding at the groove towards the design of an effective T-cell epitope candidate lished for discriminating allele-specifi c binders from non-binders using rules derived from a dataset of HLA-peptide complexes. This procedure was promising.",

These studies lead to a detailed analysis of the HLA-peptide interface at the groove and the importance of peptide side chain and backbone atomic interactions were realized [ 22 ] . Meanwhile, the amount of structural data on HLA-peptide complexes was increasing in size leading to the development of an online database [ 23 ] . Thus, information gleaned from HLA-peptide structural complexes helped to identify common pockets among alleles in the binding groove and provided insights into functional overlap among them [ 24 ] . The need for a simple, robust, generic HLA-peptide binding prediction was evident. Therefore, a model was formulated by defi ning virtual pockets at the peptide-binding groove using information gleaned from a structural dataset of HLA-peptide complexes [ 25 ] . The model (average accuracy of 60 %) was superior because of its application to any given class I allele whose sequence is clearly defi ned. The model (53 % accuracy) was then extended for class II prediction using a class II-specifi c HLA-peptide structural dataset [ 26 ] .",

Nonetheless, it was observed that alleles are covered within few HLA supertypes, where different members of a supertype bind similar peptides, yet exhibiting distinct repertoires [ 29 ] . These principles led to the development of frameworks to group alleles into HLA supertypes [ 30 , 31 ] , understand their structural basis [ 32 ] , and cluster alleles based on electrostatic potential at the groove [ 33 ] . These observations should aid in the design of peptide vaccine candidates for viruses including HIV/AIDS [ 5 , 6 ] . Further, for example, the importance of protein modifi cations to enhance HIV-1 ENV trimer spike protein vaccine across multiple clades, blood, and brain is discussed [ 4 ] . ",

This function on the principle of short epitopes developed through the binding of CD8+/CD4+-specifi c HLA alleles. HLA molecules are specifi c within ethnic populations and are polymorphic with more than 12542 known alleles as of March 2015. Thus, the binding of short peptide antigens to HLA alleles is rate limiting yet specifi c, with high sensitivity, while producing T-cell-mediated immune responses. Our understanding of this specifi c peptide binding to HLA alleles has improved using known HLA-peptide complexes. There is a search for superantigen peptides covering major HLA supertypes. Thus, peptide-binding predictions with large coverage, accuracy, sensitivity, and specifi city are essential for vaccine candidate design and development. It should be noted that available HLA-peptide binding prediction methods are highly promising in these directions.",
