            "text": "Acute lower respiratory tract infections are major causes of pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide, annually accounting for $1.9 million deaths in children <5 years of age, of which up to 90% occur in the developing world [Williams et al., 2002; Black et al., 2003 ]. In the past respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; Paramyxoviridae), influenza viruses A and B (Orthomyxoviridae), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1-3 (Paramyxoviridae), and adenoviruses (Adenoviridae) were viewed to be the leading viral causes of acute lower respiratory tract infections [Law et al., 2002; Crowe and Williams, 2003 ]. Since 2001, several novel respiratory viruses have been described including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] (Paramyxoviridae), human coronaviruses (hCoV) NL63 [van der Hoek et al., 2004] and HKU1 [Woo et al., 2005] (Coronaviridae), human bocavirus (hBoV) [Allander et al., 2005] (Parvoviridae), and two new polyomaviruses (WU virus (WUV) and KI virus (KIV)) [Allander et al., 2007; Bialasiewicz et al., 2007; Gaynor et al., 2007] (Polyomaviridae). Furthermore, improved sensitivity of diagnostic tests has lead to the increased detection of viruses previously only considered as upper respiratory tract infections in cases of acute lower respiratory tract disease, including hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E, and rhinovirus (family Picornaviridae) [Pene et al., 2003; Vabret et al., 2003; Jartti et al., 2004; Hayden, 2006; Briese et al., 2008] .",

Steve Biko Academic Hospital, Kalafong Secondary Hospital, and 1-Military Hospital. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected on the day of admission.

Of all specimens received, 93.1% and 97.3% were from children less than 5 year of age. For this reason only specimens from children <5 was included in this study. Throughout each year, 244 (2006) and 240 (2007) specimens that previously tested negative, together with 75 (2006) and 66 (2007) specimens that tested positive by routine antigen detection assays, were randomly selected for retrospective screening with RT-PCR assays representing approximately one-third of the total specimens received during each year. Table I lists the demographics of the study group. Clinical diseases severity was retrospectively recorded from patients' hospital files and broadly categorized as outpatients on the basis of patients presenting to the emergency room but not requiring admission; hospitalized patients that were ill enough to be admitted to the pediatric wards and patients needing ICU treatment. Control specimens were nasopharyngeal aspirates collected, following written informed consent, from 46 healthy children <2 years of age with a similar epidemiological background, attending a vaccine clinic in the same region. Prior to specimen collection, parents at the vaccine clinic were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding the occurrence of any symptoms associated with respiratory disease within the previous month. Only healthy children without recent respiratory disease were included in the healthy control group.",

For RSV and rhinovirus, a significantly higher percentage of patients with single infections (Table IIIa) had to be hospitalized than with co-infections (Table IIIb) (RSV (45/60) single vs. (39/70) co-infections; rhinovirus (88/100) single vs. 55/95 co-infections) (P \u00bc 0.027 and <0.001, respectively) and needed ICU treatment (P \u00bc 0.026 and <0.001, respectively). A greater percentage of patients with co-infections were HIV sero-positive relative to single infected patients with PIV-3, influenza A, adenovirus, rhinovirus, hMPV, and hBoV although not statistically significant due to low numbers.",

The following observations were made: Single infections of hBoV and hMPV were detected in association with respiratory distress, crepitations, wheezing, and gastrointestinal symptoms in several cases. Lower respiratory tract infections were diagnosed in 9/9 (100.0%) hMPV and 7/9 (77.9%) hBoV patients with single infections, with many of these patients receiving a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, or pneumonia. hBoV was also detected in two patients with upper respiratory tract infections. Single infections of rhinovirus were associated with a wide variety of diagnoses, ranging from moderate upper respiratory tract infections to severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis. hCoV-NL63 was associated with severe pneumonia and croup in a premature, patient exposed to HIV admitted to ICU, while hCoV-OC43 was detected in patients suffering from apnea attacks and lower respiratory tract infections (2/3 patients) and bronchiolitis (1/3). hCoV-229E was only detected once as the single infection in a patient admitted to ICU due to lower respiratory tract infection and apnea attacks. hCoV-HKU1 was detected once as a coinfection with PIV-3 in a patient suffering from bronchopneumonia.",

The most cases of hospitalization associated with single infections in children in this study was associated with rhinovirus, RSV, and PIV-3 (80.7%, 75%, and 68%, of cases respectively), while 56% of hMPV and hBoV single and 43% for influenza A and adenovirus cases were hospitalized. Single infections that resulted in death were the highest for RSV (10%), followed by Rhinovirus (7.3%) while 1 death was identified for PIV-3, hPMV, and hBoV each. Further investigations with larger patients groups will clarify the associated hospitalization rates of the newly described viruses in a population with a high HIV burden.

If 18.8% of these cases are due to shedding it would suggest that rhinovirus may still be associated with hospitalization in 12.5% of cases.
