The authors noted that the first cases of flu in Philadelphia were reported on September 17, 1918; however, they were downplayed, and officials allowed large public gatherings, notably a parade in support of the war effort on September 28th. In fact, Philadelphia did not implement social distancing measures until October 3rd, which was when disease spread was already overwhelming medical and health resources. St. Louis authorities, by contrast, implemented measures designed to promote social distancing within 2 days of the first civilian flu cases in the city on October 5, 1918 (Hatchett et al., 2007).",
