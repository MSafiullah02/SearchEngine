In this study, a onestep triplex real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for rapid diagnosis of influenza A/B and RSV infections to optimize diagnosis efficiency of acute respiratory infections. Cell-culture supernatants and clinical samples were used to evaluate specificity and sensitivity of the assay. The assay was used routinely during two winter epidemics for testing respiratory specimens from 2,417 patients. The limit of detection in cellculture supernatant was 1-10 plaque forming units/input (influenza A/B) and 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 50% tissue culture infectious dose/input (RSV). In clinical samples, the assay was as sensitive as commercial molecular assays for the detection of each influenza A/B and RSV (Flu-A/B and RSV-A/B r-gene TM ) individually, and far more sensitive than antigen detection. During the winter 2008-2009, the assay identified 145 RSV, 42 influenza A, and one mixed RSV-influenza A infections among 298 patients. The next winter, the assay was used in two independent hospital laboratory settings. 776 patients were tested in one hospital and 1,343 in the other, resulting in 184 and 501 RSV, 133 and 150 influenza A, and 1 and 11 mixed RSVinfluenza A infections, respectively, being",

Rapid identification of the viral cause of acute respiratory infection has consequences for patient monitoring and care, including hospital admission or discharge, administration of antibiotics and antiviral therapy, and reduction of diagnosis investigation [Adcock et al., 1997; Barenfanger et al., 2000] . Antigen detection by immunofluorescence (IF) or immunochromatography is the usual first-line diagnostic approach, although it lacks sensitivity [Steininger et al., 2002; Louie et al., 2010 ]. An alternative is to test for viral genomes by molecular means. Although various inhouse and commercial assays are available, first-line molecular detection is rarely routinely practiced, either because of high cost (commercial assays) or because few assays are multiplex and have short turnaround times [Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Gunson et al., 2005; Kuypers et al., 2006; Bonroy et al., 2007; van de Pol et al., 2007; Brittain-Long et al., 2008] .",

Also, children with influenza often present with alarming neurological symptoms associated with respiratory disease, but will not need further neurological investigation if influenza virus is detected rapidly [2009b] . Similarly, if a viral infection is diagnosed in a newborn with isolated fever, investigations for neonatal bacterial infection can be limited. Moreover, early administration of neuraminidase inhibitors in cases of influenza may prevent severe forms of infection, as reported during the influenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic [2009a,c] . Finally, when RSV and influenza viruses co-circulate at an epidemic rate (as was the case in 2008-2009 and 2009-2010) , it may not be possible to distinguish infection by one virus from that by the other on the basis of clinical presentation [ Bosis et al., 2008; Bourgeois et al., 2009] . Thus, rapid and sensitive tools are needed specifically to detect influenza and RSV infections, and to identify mixed infections. The diagnostic value of rapid antigen detection tests for influenza and RSV infections remains a subject of debate: Although technically well adapted to the management of acute respiratory infections, the currently available tests lack sensitivity and specificity [Steininger et al., 2002; Louie et al., 2010] . The aim of this study was to improve the efficiency of diagnosis of acute respiratory infections, in a context of high rates of infection by three major pathogens, which can be involved in mixed infections. The higher sensitivity of RT-PCR compared to antigen detection prompted us to use this technology to develop an inexpensive (<10.00s/test), rapid (<4 hr), specific and sensitive assay, targeting the genomes of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. Triplex RT-PCR is cheaper and faster than three simplex assays. To facilitate use in daily practice, the procedure was simplified by adapting the extraction step to the MagNA Pure Compact system (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France), and the assay was successfully transferred to a different laboratory setting, where a different real-time PCR thermocycler was used (ABI PRISM 1 7500 Real Time PCR System -Applera). Although not to be compared to rapid antigen testing, the assay was efficient enough to provide clinicians with specific and sensitive results daily: For samples made available at 13:00, the results were returned by 16:30.",

            "text": "The assay was designed to detect simultaneously the presence of the three viral genomes, and could thus identify mixed infections. Its ability to detect various strains of viruses was assessed with a panel of viruses isolated in cell-culture. With this panel, the sensitivity and efficiency of the triplex RT-PCR were found to be slightly lower than those obtained with the equivalent simplex assays, although the difference was not significant (results not shown), as previously reported by others for multiplex RT-PCR [Bonroy et al., 2007] . However, the sensitivity and efficiency of the assay were suitable for diagnosis. Indeed, the results were concordant for 100% of the 75 samples found positive with commercial RT-PCR assays, and the triplex assay successfully detected mixed infections. The 7900HT thermocycler allows no more than three different fluorescent dyes in real-time PCR assays, so the triplex assay could not also include an internal control. However, no PCR inhibitors were detected in 132 samples tested by the Argene method, indicating that the risk of missing a positive sample was small. If necessary for routine diagnosis, an internal control could be added to the sample prior to extraction, and the corresponding control RT-PCR could then be performed in parallel during the same run. The results obtained with this assay in daily practice during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 seasons were consistent with the data provided by the national influenza-monitoring network of GPs and pediatricians GROG (Groupes R\u00e9gionaux d'Observation de la Grippe-Regional Influenza Surveillance Group; http:// www.grog.org), and by the National Influenza Centre (Northern France), indicating, in particular, that circulation of influenza B was sporadic or absent in France during the periods studied. As previously described [Bourgeois et al., 2009] , RSV infection was more frequent than influenza in young children, as evidenced by the higher percentage of RSV-positive specimens, even during the influenza A(H1N1) pandemics. Finally, the availability of a molecular tool allowing to distinguish rapidly influenza A from RSV in two general hospital settings in the context of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemics was of utmost value. In conclusion, the user-friendly in-house triplex RT-PCR reported here was efficient for testing nasopharyngeal specimens for current epidemic strains of influenza A (including seasonal H1N1, predominant in 2007 H1N1, predominant in -2008 H1N1, predominant in [Vaux, 2008 , seasonal H3N2, as sub-typed by cellculture during the 2008-2009 season and pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009), influenza B, RSV-A, and RSV-B. Its ability to detect mixed infections also facilitates investigations to increase our knowledge about the incidence and severity of influenza A and RSV co-infections [Kehl et al., 2001; Coiras et al., 2004] .",
