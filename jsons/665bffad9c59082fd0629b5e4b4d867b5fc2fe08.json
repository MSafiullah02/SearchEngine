It is suggested that potential acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2 from prior exposure may be determined by detecting the presence of circulating IgG antibodies against viral antigens, such as the spike glycoprotein and its receptor binding domain (RBD). Testing our asymptomatic population for evidence of COVID-19 immunity would also offer valuable epidemiologic data to aid health care policies and health care management. Currently, there are over 100 antibody tests that are being used around the world without approval from the FDA or similar regulatory bodies, and they are mostly for rapid and qualitative assessment, with different degrees of error rates. ELISA-based testing for sensitive and rigorous quantitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can potentially offer mechanistic insights into the COVID-19 disease and aid communities uniquely challenged by limited financial resources and access to commercial testing products. Employing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD and spike protein generated in the laboratory, we devised a quantitative ELISA for the detection of circulating serum All rights reserved.

One patient who did not develop antibodies to the RBD completely recovered from COVID-19. In surveying 99 healthy donor samples (procured between 2017-February 2020), we detected RBD antibodies in one donor from February 2020 collection with three others exhibiting antibodies to the spike protein but not the RBD. Collectively, our study suggests that more rigorous and quantitative analysis, employing large scale samples sets, is required to determine whether antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or RBD is associated with protection from COVID-19 disease. It is also conceivable that humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or RBD works in association with adaptive T cell response to determine clinical sequela and severity of COVID-19 disease.",

As social distancing measures appear to reduce the spread of the virus, the development of testing modalities for diagnosis and acquired immunity for SARS-CoV-2 are essential to inform health care management and public health policies. Lessons from previous corona virus infection studies, including the moderate upper respiratory tract disease or 'common cold' caused by the human corona viruses, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, CoV-OC43, or CoV-HKU1, and the more severe respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, support an idea that prior exposure could result in immunity to the virus, which protects against re-infection and may limit symptoms if re-infection occurs 3, 4 . Reports on immunity (detection of antibodies) against corona virus (mainly SARS-CoV) acquired from exposure indicate circulating antibodies are observed from 2 to 17 years following recovery 5, 6 .",

            "text": "Data from China, the epicenter of COVID-19, indicated up to 27% of SARS-CoV-2 patients 85 years or older die from the disease, in contrast with approximately 1% of SARS-CoV-2 patients 54 years or younger 7 . Recent findings also highlight age as a significant factor associated with mortality and hospitalization in Europe and the USA due to 9 , with 21% mortality observed in 56 to 78 years old New Yorkers 9 . This may be reflecting aging-associated changes in the adaptive immune system 10 , and possibly other co-morbidities, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes 9 which could also play a role in altering immune response to infection. The activation of the immune system in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical presentation is likely complex and further studies are required to measure immune responses towards infection, recovery, and development of immunity. Emerging findings mostly rely on confirmed or suspect symptomatic cases receiving care at health care facilities, and it remains unclear today what percentage of the population has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and remained asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic, since they did not require care and thus were not captured in healthcare records. Such unaccounted cases could underestimate the reported percentage of the population that has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. This limitation also challenges the ability for precise assessment of the percentage of our population that has developed immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The detection of circulating antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may inform on immunity to the virus, and ongoing efforts for sensitive and specific assays include the development of lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay (LFIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISA) designed to detect antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 viral proteins, some of which were granted emergency use authorization by the FDA (https://www.fda.gov). Additional validation studies are critically needed to define the utility of the assays under development, and consideration vis-a-vis cost and accessibility must be taken in consideration to enable testing in communities that require the most assistance. To this end, we developed and tested a simple procedure to enable the detection of circulating antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 viral proteins.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped (+) ssRNA virus that encodes 14 viral proteins, including structural proteins, a replicase, and proteases. Viral proteins on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope interact with human cells to promote entry of the virus into the cell. Specifically, the binding of the viral surface spike (S) glycoprotein to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) on human lung epithelial cells enables internalization via receptor mediated endocytosis, a potentially ratelimiting step for infectivity and viral propagation 11, 12 . The receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein interact with ACE2 with high affinity 13 . The S protein and its RBD emerged as potential antigens against which humoral immunity may develop, and the role of the S protein and its RBD in viral entry suggest antibodies against these proteins may present with neutralizing properties. Monoclonal antibodies cloned from memory B cells of convalescent COVID-19 patients demonstrated S protein binding and in vitro neutralizing activity 14 . Seroconversion yielding circulating IgG antibodies against such antigen may thus inform on acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Notably, studies of circulating antibodies from patients with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 showed little cross-neutralization 15 , supporting that antibodies against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 may be specific to the novel virus. In 3 of COVID-19 patients serum, antibodies to both RBD and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were detected by ELISA when compared to serum from patients with acute NL63 infection, and convalescent serum following dengue, chikungunya, and hantavirus infection 16 , and in a study of 175 adult Chinese COVID-19 convalescent patients, circulating IgG antibodies did not cross react with SARS-CoV antigen 17 . In the latter, the specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA assays for RBD, S1, S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was however not specifically reported 17 . These studies informed on the feasibility of detecting circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with the potential to inform on acquired immunity, and support diagnosis. The detection of circulating antibodies for example offered added sensitivity to RNA detection (RT-PCR assay) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in 173 hospitalized Chinese patients 18 . A comparative analysis of LFIA and ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 full length spike protein IgG and IgM antibodies indicated ELISA was superior for detection of antibodies in 40 COVID-19 patients and 50 pre-2019 donors, and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG antibodies were detected in all 31 RT-PCR COVID-19 positive patients 10 days after diagnosis and up to 8 weeks post diagnosis 19 . In 16 European RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, ELISA captured circulating IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein when compared to control samples as early as 5 days following onset of symptoms, and plaquereduction neutralization tests support such antibodies have neutralizing properties 20 . Building upon the recent findings that unveiled the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its binding with human ACE2 21 and the emerging data on the early detection of potentially neutralizing antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we generated and tested SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RBD as antigen substrates. The substrates were utilized in ELISAs designed to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RBD. We ascertained SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels in 99 healthy donor serum samples collected from 2017 to 2020, as well as serum from 20 RT-PCR validated SARS-CoV-2 positive COVID-19 patients.",

Spike Ectodomain-Strep Trap and Spike Ectodomain-His Trap/SuperdexGF are described above. For Spike Ectodomain-His Trap/SuperdexGF, 50 \u00b5g/mL (355.37 nM) was used, for Spike Ectodomain-Strep Trap, 2 \u00b5g/mL (14.21 nM) was used. The proteins were diluted in 50mM sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) -sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) coating buffer, pH 9.6, and allowed to bind to the well (50 microliters per well) for at 37\u00baC 2 hours or at 4\u00baC overnight. The coating mixture was removed from the wells and the wells were subsequently blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS (200 microliters per well) at room temperature for 1 hour. Serum samples were thawed on ice, serially diluted in TBS, and dispensed (50 microliters per well) in triplicates into the coated and blocked wells. For the performance assays shown in Figure 3c -d, 50 microliters of anti-StrepTagII antibody (Table S1, 1:500) in 2% BSA was added to the wells. The plate was incubated for at 37\u00baC 1 hour, then washed three times with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (200 microliters per well). The wells were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies (Table S1 , 50 microliters per well) at 37\u00baC for 1 hour, and washed again three times with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (200 microliters per well). The last wash was removed from the well, and 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine reagent ( Table S1 ) was added to each well (50 microliters per well). The plate was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, and read at 650nm using the Versamax spectrophotometer from Molecular Devices. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.18 M sulfuric acid in each well (50 microliters per well), and the wells were read again at 450nm. In Figures 4-6 , the negative control (NC) range represents the mean +/standard deviation of all controls utilized. Controls included secondary antibody alone, and mixture of secondary antibodies and serially diluted serum samples on uncoated wells (high titers); these defined the range of negative controls (NC) signal. The OD450nm values were normalized (ratio) using the average OD450nm value of all 2017 healthy donor serum samples measured plus one standard deviation of this mean: OD450/[OD450 HD2017 + 1SD]. The highest titer was used for comparative analyses, which included the 1:50 serum dilution for the Spike Ectodomain-Strep Trap and the 1:100 serum dilution for the Spike-RBD. In some of the samples measured, the arbitrary cut off for positivity were normalized (ratio) OD450nm values greater than 1.5, borderline measurements were defined as normalized OD450nm of 1.2 to 1.5 or less, and OD450nm less than 1.2 were defined as negative.",

The heat map of the computed ratios showed elevated ratios for the serum of the SARS-CoV-2 patients and healthy donors serum collected in 2020. Arbitrary cut-off points were used to aid the visual distribution of the positive and negative serum. Ratios greater than 1.5 were labeled positive, ratios between 1.2 and 1.5 were labeled borderline, and ratios less than 1.2 were labeled negative (Figure 7b ). With these cut-off points, 10 SARS-CoV-2 serum samples were positive, 7 were borderline, and 3 were negative (n=20 total) for antibody detection against the Spike Ectodomain-Strep Tag protein (Figure 7b) .

A450nm readings were not elevated in all but one serum sample of the healthy donors collected in 2020, and in one of the healthy donors collected in 2019(Figure 5b). There was no detection of Spike-RBD antibodies in 5 out of 20 SARS-CoV-2 patient serum, and 3 out of 20 were borderline(Figure 5b).The A450nm readings were significantly elevated in the serum of the SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to all healthy donor serum(Figure 5c-d).",

Similar to the results obtained with Spike Ectodomain-Strep Tag, elevated A450nm were noted in SARS-CoV-2 serum samples, as well as in some of the 2020 healthy donor serum (e.g. # 203, Figure 6a-b). The A450nm readings were significantly elevated in the serum of the SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to healthy donor serum (Figure 6c).Additional internal validation of the ELISA designed in this study included a twoindependent-operator analysis of serum samples against the Spike Ectodomain-Strep Tag protein. Each operator followed a defined protocol without prior consultation regarding assay logistics. The A450nm readings indicated robust correlation between the two operators(Figure 6d), supporting a reproducible methodology and protocol definition. The A450nm readings obtained using the Spike-RBD protein (Figure 5) and the Spike Ectodomain-Strep Tag (Figure 3) also significantly correlated with one another, with most healthy donor samples exhibiting lack of antibody detection(Figure 6d).
