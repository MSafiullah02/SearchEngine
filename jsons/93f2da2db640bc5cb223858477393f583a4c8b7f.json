The authors do this by introducing a broader conceptualization of corruption. The dimensions of corruption and their importance in explaining the exporters' successes in international markets are developed empirically. Partial Least Squares formative indicators are used in a comprehensive model including consumer resources (wealth and information resources), physical distance (kilometers and time zones), and cultural distance (linguistic and values differences) as alternative explanatory variables. Finally, differences in the model's performance across data from three exporting countries (France, Japan, and the US) are delineated and discussed. For example, the successes of French and Japanese exporters in international markets are in part determined by the levels of corruption in target countries. Alternatively, corruption in target countries does not appear to affect the successes of American exporters in global markets. The conceptualization of corruption in this study extends the more narrow view of corruption solely as bribery.",

As a result, managers must assess unfamiliar business landscapes and scrutinize the economic, political, religious, cultural, and economic factors that often influence the successes of business ventures. Along with the obvious market potential, managers also recognize negative societal elements such as bribery or violence that can affect their overseas marketing activities. Questions arise such as: What are potential causes of business losses? What kind of adversities will the firm and its managers be forced to cope with in foreign markets? What fears do managers have in sending employees overseas?",

As an environmental barrier to international marketing efforts, corruption continues to complicate firms' efforts to enter and be successful in particular international markets. Risks to financial performance and employee well-being are greater in markets where rule of law and transparency in decision making are little applied. Increasingly, home country laws and/or corporate ethics preclude commercial operations where corruption is rampant. Thus, managers, firms, and policy makers alike would benefit from unraveling the role that corruption plays in undermining their efforts. As the presence and mechanisms of corruption are difficult to understand, this study begins to explore and quantify corruption as an environmental barrier to international marketing efforts.",

By developing and testing a predictive model centered on an enriched concept of corruption, the analysis provides information about both its systemic and construct validities. Using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) form of structural equation modeling, the authors fit the same model for three datasets including market penetration statistics for exporters from France, Japan, and the United States. Additional novel aspects of the study include the use of new measures of linguistic distance and comparative violence levels as potential antecedents of market success. As it introduces new dimensions of corruption, the conceptualization of corruption in this paper is thus broader than the conventionally accepted notion of corruption solely as bribery.",

In 1977, the US government specifically targeted bribery in foreign markets through passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA continues to prohibit American executives and their companies from bribing officials of foreign governments (US Department of Justice, 2004). As foreign governments control large portions of their industries in most of the world, the FCPA applies to a large percentage of export transactions for American firms. Immediately after passage of the law, American executives reported business lost to foreign competitors that were not subject to similar statutes in their home countries (Kaikati and Label, 1980) . Most recently many member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations have begun enforcing bribery restrictions similar to the FCPA. Thus, bribery of foreign government officials is currently prohibited by laws in all the three exporting countries considered in this study. That is, Japan and the United States in 1999 and France in 2000 joined the OECD Convention. Of course, the United States Congress had passed and President Carter has signed into law the FCPA in 1977.",

            "text": "Recent focus has shifted to unraveling the entanglement of sociocultural, political, and economic effects of corruption. Scholars across disciplines acknowledge corruption's persistence in human societies over time and space (Aidt, 2003) , and agree on the nature of corruption as a very complex, pervasive, and intertwined social phenomenon (Park, 2003) . Most imply that corruption is endogenous to a society, usually one element in a cycle of activities that both empowers and obstructs the workings of social, political, and economic institutions. Everett et al. (2006, p. 1) comment on corruption, ''\u2026its definition, consequences, and causes are more numerous than might be first imagined.' ' Aidt (2003, p. 632) concurs, ''Corruption is a many-faceted phenomenon and it is hard to give a precise and comprehensive definition\u2026yet it is important to try.'' Much research has also been done on the determinants of corruption (Aidt, 2003; Davis and Ruhe, 2003; Sanyal, 2005) , the consequences of corruption (Aidt, 2003; Alam, 1995; Maor, 2004; Wei and Shleifer, 2000; Winters, 2004) , and ways to combat corruption (Ali and Isse, 2003; Brademas and Heimann, 1998; Husted, 1999) . It is no wonder that corruption has topped the research agenda of international institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations. Despite the esoteric criticism regarding the concept of corruption, western academics and practitioners have most often employed Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (TICPI) as the best single measure of the theoretical construct across countries. The TICPI (Transparency International, 2007 ) is a poll of polls, drawing on 14 surveys from seven independent institutions worldwide combining perceptions of business people, academics, and country analysts alike. While it is an international poll, it is problematic because the seven institutions providing survey data are based mostly in western countries, where corruption is most often defined narrowly as bribery. In fact, only one of the reporting institutions is based in a non-western culture, specifically Asia. One study asserts that the attempt to understand corruption from the narrow perspective of bribery translates into an attempt to globalize the western definition of corruption (Sandholtz and Gray, 2004) . It is understandable that managers of various backgrounds and experiences would define corruption differently and most certainly, might not limit its definition to bribery.",

Donleavy et al. (2008) suggest that in China, corruption has three faces: tanwu (malpractice), whui (bribery), and tequan (privileges). Thus, corruption encompasses more than simple bribery; in fact, it is apparent from the discussion above that a consensus definition eludes scholars. Webster's Dictionary (2007) defines corruption narrowly as ''bribery'' and broadly as ''impairment of integrity, depravity, decay, and decomposition.'' Synonyms listed in Roget's International Thesaurus (2001) include ''bribery, infection, decay, deterioration, and dishonesty.'' Taking cultural relativism to an extreme, it has been argued that rampant consumerism is corrupting India's newly opened markets or that individualism, at the expense of group solidarity, is corrupting Japan's social foundations (Houston and Graham, 2001) . Or, profits and currency speculation, not seen as forms of corruption in the US, are frowned upon by many in the emergent Russian nation.",

It extends the Webster's Dictionary meaning and acknowledges corruption as a complex notion resonating with the views of political, social, and international business scholars that corruption cannot be tightly and uniformly defined. Instead, its exact measurable definition is allowed to differ across national perspectives because different cultures often hold differing perceptions of ''that which contributes to the deterioration of society''. Most important, this definition allows us to empirically identify how international marketing managers evaluate corruption and offers insight on how managers may behave with reference to their assessment (Houston and Graham, 2001) .",

Scholars generally concur that corruption is clearly influenced in part by cultural values (Kaikati and Label, 1980; Sanyal, 2005; Scholtens and Dam, 2007) . Most also agree that the cultural values closely related to corruption are empirically represented by two of Hofstede's cultural dimensions: Individualism/Collectivism and Power Distance (Davis and Ruhe, 2003; Houston and Graham, 2001; Husted, 1999) . ''Individualism (IDV) pertains to societies in which the ties between individuals are loose: everyone is expected to look after himself or herself and his or her immediate family'' (Hofstede, 1991) . Its opposite is collectivism, where group membership and cooperation are paramount. Similarly, power distance (PDI) is defined as the extent to which less powerful members of institutions and organizations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally. In high power distance countries people tend to accept authority and dependence. Hofstede (1980) notes the high correlation between IDV and PDI in his own data (r = 0.67) suggesting that collectivism and hierarchy usually coincide. Conceptually, these notions can be integrated into a concept that Cateora et al. (2009) refer to as relationship-oriented (ROCs) versus information-oriented cultures (IOCs). That is, in 254",

For example, patronage is seen more in the highly networked ROCs even though these countries have laws discouraging patronage and bribery in both political and commercial settings.

Furthermore, Redding and Schott (2003) argue that the world's geographically peripheral countries are becoming increasingly economically remote over time. For this paper, physical distance is measured in two ways -difference in (1) time zones and (2) kilometers between buyers and sellers. Working across large numbers of time zones is daunting. For example, the business day is just beginning at 8 a.m. in Los Angeles while it has already ended at 11 p.m. in the Philippines. The costs of disrupted family lives resulting from inconvenient conference calls and jet lag are substantial, if not quantifiable. Trade relationships between countries that are farther apart in kilometers will also be more costly to maintain because of added transportation, communication, and business travel costs. Thus, it is hypothesized that distance plays a role in determining market attractiveness.",

As such, cultural values differ among societies and are the underlying mechanisms that drive environmental factors such as corruption. For instance, France is known for its paternalistic conception of prerogative power toward regulation 256 Jennifer D. Chandler and John L. Graham (Hayward, 1983) compared with the Dutch corporatist tradition toward coping with passionate social interests. Or, the belief in liberalism gives the United States a more pluralistic perspective, while in Britain the philosophy of self-regulation exercises more control over advertising, financial services, and various other professional activities (Ogus, 1995) . Therefore, national culture plays an important role in determining how markets and institutions in different countries operate. All international business relationships depend on communications (mass-media and face-to-face) and negotiations (Brahm et al., 1992) between people of different cultures. The literature is quite clear that greater cultural differences or distances (sometimes referred to as psychic distances) will make transactions less efficient (Adler and Graham, 1989; Kogut and Singh, 1988; Mitra and Golder, 2002) . That is, a foreign markets' perceived cultural homophily may drive the preferences expressed by managers in the exporting countries (Shenkar, 2001) .",

Individualism and competition yield benefits for the greater society. Indeed, consistent with Weber's reasoning (1930) , Hostede finds individualism is strongly correlated with GNP per capita (Hofstede, 2001, p. 251) . He explains that monopolies are more common in collectivistic countries, while in more individualistic countries competition goes hand-in-hand with greater economic freedom and the associated better economic performance. Finally, in a series of tests of all the potential relationships among cultural values, economic performance, and corruption Jing and Graham (2008) report that the most analytical credence accrues to cultural values causing both economic performance and corruption. The last go on to explain that innovation, a key driver of affluence, is more difficult in relationship-oriented cultures, because innovations tend to disrupt long lasting interpersonal bonds and are therefore resisted.

On the other hand, a serious argument can be made that corruption impedes economic development, which then may provoke even more corruption (Brademas and Heimann, 1998) . Pavarala (1996) provides a concise summary of the mechanisms explaining how stage of economic development might influence corruption levels. Generally, such studies suggest that corruption stems from a lack of capitalism and inadequate pay for government employees. However, consistent with the findings of Jing and Graham (2008) we have excluded a connection between consumer resources and corruption levels in our model specification.

However, the use of a PLS algorithm, including a formative indicator approach to the measurement of the constructs in the study, does. A formative indicator measurement approach does not assume that separate measures of constructs necessarily coincide (correlate). Rather, the contribution of each indicator to the definition of each construct is specifically determined simultaneously with the testing of the theoretical relationships among constructs (Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer, 2001; Fornell and Bookstein, 1982; Jarvis et al., 2003) . This approach is particularly appropriate as corruption is a concept expected to vary across cultures of both of the exporting and the importing countries involved in international marketing. Thus, the measurement model consists of six constructs, five of which are quantified by at least two measures. Descriptive statistics and correlation matrices are provided in Table I . The use of PLS makes two specific contributions. First, this approach allows for clarification of relationships among vague, esoteric constructs (such as corruption) that are present in the external environment of global exchange relationships. The measurement of these constructs would not be possible with classical measurement theory. However, to gauge each construct's reliability and validity, each construct (along with its indicators) is embedded in a structure of theoretically important relationships. Additionally, PLS is particularly appropriate when different levels of measurement (e.g., the ordinal measure of linguistic distance) and small sample sizes (i.e., n = 78) pertain (Falk and Miller, 1992) .",

The scores can vary from ''0 = highly corrupt'' to ''10 = highly clean''. As most of these surveys equate corruption with bribery, this is the measure for bribery. Piracy is measured by the Business Software Alliance (2005), which annually reports ''the difference between software applications installed (demand) and software applications legally shipped (supply)''. The measure of Violence is the number deaths by violence per 100,000 people (UCIrvine, 2006) and is derived from the World Health Organization (2004).

Individualism (IDV) is high in societies where the ties between individuals are loose and group membership is less important. Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI) relates to the degree that people are concerned for security in their lives and, therefore, (Hofstede, 2001) .

Triandis' (1977) hierarchy of subjective culture also proposed a measure of culture that stems from language, or linguistic distance. Based on his multicountry empirical study, Triandis proposed that values are derived from elemental cognitive structures, which in turn are derived from lower-level abstractions of language: words, morphemes, and phonemes. Language is also one of several proximal antecedents to various cognitive processes, which in turn are the antecedents of values in his subjective culture model. Other researchers (Hofstede, 2001; Usunier, 1998 ) support these ideas. More specifically, Nisbett (2003) argues that the observed divergence in thinking begins with language acquisition. That is, American parents focus on teaching kids clear, context-independent definitions of words. Alternatively, definitions of words in Japanese are often ambiguous and highly context-dependent. The structures of the respective languages learned thus influence the foci and processes of thinking, or culture. Thus, another measure of culture used in this study is linguistic distance as measured in West and Graham (2004) .",

That is, French and Japanese exporters, different from their American counterparts, appear to be deterred by corruption in international markets. The construct of corruption also demonstrates nomological validity through its strong relationship to relationship-oriented cultures in the nested model. Further, by using a formative indicator approach we can discern the key aspects of corruption that are meaningful to exporters from the three countries included in the study. That is, across the datasets, bribery and intellectual property piracy have proven salient while black markets and disease were of relatively little concern. However, for French exporters relative violence levels also proved to be of importance based on the correlation coefficient and the latent variable weight listed in Tables I and II, respectively. As mentioned above, corruption is insignificant in determining market attractiveness for the Americans. This is so despite, or perhaps because of, the threedecade old US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Perhaps American exporters are undeterred by the prevalence of bribery in target countries because they have had 30 years of experience in using the ''excuse'' of the FCPA as a reason not to pay bribes. Alternatively, because Japan and France have only recently joined the OECD and United Nations anti-bribery conventions, executives in those countries are at least temporarily more reluctant to trade in corrupt countries. Indeed, other studies confirm such a reluctance among US exporters immediately following passage of the FCPA (Houston and Graham, 2001) .",

Physical distance hampers marketing success and attractiveness for exporters from all three countries. Moreover, temporal distance is a much more important obstacle than mere miles. The findings clearly demonstrate that crossing time zones limits marketing success, yielding a strong preference for north-south trade, or at least trade with close neighbors. Perhaps jet travel, the Internet, and other communications advances are ameliorating physical distances, but time zone differences still appear to be a substantial impediment to trade between countries.",

Five of the six are important South East Asian trading partners for Japan despite the differences in values and language.

Certainly the Japanese are well known for taking great care in adjusting marketing efforts to host country cultures (Adler and Graham, 1989; Hodgson et al., 2008) .

As exporting countries have unique geographical locations and cultures, target market A may be the most attractive for country X, and likewise B for Y, etc. And, in the three exporting nations studied, market success is not statistically affected by income per capita or information systems of target countries. This supports Prahalad's (2005) findings regarding the attractiveness of the ''bottom of the pyramid.'' All these inferences hold important insights for international marketing strategy formulation and entry decisions. Policy makers should also be encouraged by our findings. While culture's influence is pervasive, it is apparently also malleable. Witness the sequential adoption of the so-called western intellectual property legal regime in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan in recent decades (Lam and Graham, 2007) . Or, consider the successes of Singapore and Hong Kong in fighting corruption in the business systems in those relationship-oriented cultures as evinced their continuing high rankings in the TICPI. Perhaps the British colonial influence has operated there? However, now also we have the success story of Japan as well. Alternatively, perhaps the most troubling datum is the decline in America's ranking in the 2007 TICPI. Yes, culture and levels of corruption can change.",

A comprehensive model refining the relationship between corruption and international marketing success was tested for three major world exporters, and the model was found to work differently across the three. Finally, by looking simultaneously at the results from the three exporting countries' trade relationships, this study yields a rich scan of the external environment in which international marketing takes place.
