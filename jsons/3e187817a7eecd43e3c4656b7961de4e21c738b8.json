            "text": "History is not kind to critics. Its writers typically dismiss where they do not simply ignore those whose careful reviews argue caution in the face of works destined to become, in the future, classics. Think, here, Prince Peter Kropotkin whose naturalist studies focused upon the limits of Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory and the direction in which research based upon it would be best directed. 1 Only today-more than 130 years later-is the importance of his critique being acknowledged. 2 There are good critics, of course, even great ones. The best are not only prominent in their field but also stylish essayists whose careful insights educate the general and the professional reader alike. Harvard biologist Richard Lewontin is a current example, an essayist who enfolds each review within an erudite recital of the state of the science being discussed. The result leaves the reader (and author) gasping: 'I wish I had said that.' 3 As an example of a good critic unfairly dismissed by history think Edmund A Parkes, the British physician and researcher who reviewed John Snow's famous 1855 opus, On the Mode of Communication of Cholera. 4 In a seven-page, approximately 7800-word essay, Parkes carefully considered and found wanting Snow's argument that cholera (and plague, and typhoid fever) was solely waterborne. 5 Although the myth of Snow's brilliance insists his critics were wrong, a careful reading of Parkes' concerns insists that the myth of Snow is overstated 6 . Yes, cholera is a waterborne disease. But were we to read Snow's work with attention but without foreknowledge we, too, would find its argument incomplete. 7 This review of the 19th century debate over cholera has more than historical significance. It pits a simplistic, focused explanation against one that was broad and multifactorial. And, too, it demands attention be paid to the researcher's methodologies and their sufficiency, not just results. Finally, it pits the myth of the lone researcher against the reality of science as a complex, communal, interactive process. In a time of rapidly evolving, epidemic zoonotics, the lessons of that earlier debate are as contemporary as the evolving state of the mutating coronavirus that so concerns us today.",

Snow was not the only author to propose a waterborne disease. William Budd was another. 13 Most, however, did so within a more or less multifactorial context that acknowledged then prevalent miasmatic theories of airborne disease generation and diffusion.",

The first part of Parkes' essay covered the older data, carefully reviewing 11 separate cases of localized cholera outbreaks described as evidentiary by Snow. Time and again, Parkes complained that Snow continually stated possibilities as certainties and suppositions as fact. In a review of the Horsleydown data, for example, 'instead of leaving the origin of the first case uncertain', Parkes writes, Snow assumed without conclusive evidence its source; at Albion Terrace he insisted without proof that cholera 'must' have entered local drainpipes in the water even though other investigators argued different explanations.",

Time and again, relevant data by which Snow's theories might have been rigorously considered within the science of the day were lamentably absent. 'Now, certainly in no less than seven of the eleven cases', Parkes concluded, 'the evidence to prove the effect of the water is so loosely stated, and the accessory circumstance of the outbreaks are so utterly disregarded, that we do not think any one can feel that even a tolerable case is made out in favor of Dr Snow's opinion'. 5 In the remaining four cases the evidence was stronger but not conclusive.",

Snow employed two very different types of analysis, both then common in disease studies. The first included a recitation of case reports and the second was cartographic. Famously, Snow applied for the mortality reports from the General Register Office and had the first weeks of the outbreak's mortality included on a map of the Broad Street area with, of course, the location of water pumps that provided district water. 'It would clearly appear', agreed Parkes, 'that the center of the [cholera] outburst was a spot in Broad-street, close to which is the accused pump; and that cases were scattered all round this nearly in a circle, becoming less numerous as the exterior of the circle approached'. 5 But to Parkes the centric distribution appeared more likely to present the image of an airborne rather than waterborne pattern of disease diffusion. 'If it were owing to the water,' he asked, 'why should not the cholera have prevailed equally everywhere the water was drunk?' And whereas the epicentre of the outbreak was clearly in the vicinity of the pump 'there are, indeed, so many pumps in this district that where ever the outbreak had taken place, it would most probably have had one pump or other in its vicinity'. 5 Snow provided neither the type of comparative nor even descriptive statistics, then widely employed, that might have strengthened his mapped argument. In the 1854 Broad Street study the local curate, Rev. Henry Whitehead, published in 1854 a monograph replete with descriptive statistics of the outbreak and its relative impact on citizens. 15 Without that type of analysis Snow's mapped argument was open to multiple interpretations.",

He did not, however, use this to calculate comparative mortality ratios that would have helped his case contamination of water, or rather, the evidence in favour of its purity; 2nd, the deficiency in negative evidence, that there was no other local cause which produced the partial outbreak; and 3rd, the fact that the disease ran rapidly to its acme, and then declined, while the water supply remained the same'. 5 These were serious deficiencies. Indeed, Snow admitted that, examining the pump's water, 'I found so little impurity in it of an organic nature that I hesitated to come to a conclusion'. In 1854 and early 1855, available evidence did not support the idea that the well itself had been contaminated. 'It will have been observed', wrote Parkes, 'that the contamination of the pump water with drains, or by any other method, is not even attempted to be proved . . . .'

Indeed, Snow's map did not include the sewer lines-included in three other contemporary maps-and misrepresented both the size and location of the former plague burial pit whose southeast corner was a short block from the Broad Street pump (Fig. 2) . 17 Snow's report was published before an 1855 engineering study that revealed a break in the bricking of the Broad Street well and visual evidence that materials flowed from a local cesspool into it. 18 Also in 1855, Reverend Whitehead identified the index case in his report for a parish inquiry into the outbreak, a family that lived near and used that cesspool for its wastes. Had Snow not published prematurely, before those data were available, and had he added even minimal comparative and descriptive statistics, his case would have been more persuasive.",

'Snow endeavours to meet this difficulty by giving, from the Parliamentary return, the number of houses supplied respectively by the two companies. But this return applies to the entire districts, and not to the special district where the supplies are intermingled, so that really we are in doubt whether the Ditton water is supplied to half of this special district, or to a quarter or a tenth part'.",

In both the Broad Street and the South London studies, Snow failed to include the type of carefully constructed mortality ratios based on population that would have permitted comparison between the areas of 'good' and 'bad' water. In neither case did he vigorously address alternative disease theories, even where the geography of the outbreak insisted they be seriously considered. This was especially galling in Snow's South London study where, Parkes noted, Snow paid no attention to 'Farr's Law' demonstrating an inverse relation between altitude above sea level and cholera mortality. 'He alludes, indeed, to, but speedily dismisses the important law of elevation', wrote Parkes, 'demonstrated by the Registrar-General; and refused, indeed, to admit the effect of elevation and refers the differences of prevalence entirely to the water supply'. 5 Some of the faults of Snow's 1855 tome could have been easily avoided. Had he constructed other, distancebased polygons around other pumps in the Broad Street area, he might have constructed relative mortality ratios that implicated the central pump more strongly. Had he delayed publication until the pump's casing could be carefully investigated-and the index case identifiedthe contamination of the Broad Street pump would have been evident rather than deduced. And as he admitted later, his 'grand experiment' failed because he rushed to publication before the required data were Figure 3 In his analysis Dr John Simon found that, at a general level, cholera mortality could be related to different water suppliers. At a finer scale of analysis this relationship broke down, however. Therefore, he believed the findings suggestive but not conclusive available. When the data from the General Register office were made available they were, as Dr Simon correctly noted, suggestive but inconclusive using the analytical tools of the day.",

Of equal and perhaps greater importance is the necessity of a defence of Snow's critic, an argument against the near universal myth of Snow the great and lonely hero. At a 2013 conference celebrating the 200th anniversary of Snow's birth, I argued the obvious limits of Snow's work and the appropriateness of his contemporaries' criticisms and cautions. 22 And, too, I argued the falsity of the claims made on Snow's behalf by modern historians. Snow did not create 'show leather' epidemiology or mapped cartography. He did not create the experimenta cruces. He did not prove cholera was waterborne. Other contemporary researchers-Reverend Henry Whitehead, William Farr, 23 John Simon etc.-were more exacting and better epidemiological researchers than Snow. And yet we persist in the modern myth of Snow, a myth born in a 1901 textbook on the Principles of Sanitary Science and Public Health, 24 and later expanded in the 1930s 25 as a broad truth. 26 But, 'We need heroes, don't we?' a member of the conference audience asked plaintively. It does not matter if Snow was a hero or a chump, in other words. We need to believe in the solitary genius as we face the disease challenges of our own time. Snow is a symbol, in other words, and the truth of his work as a researcher does not matter. My reply is a suitable conclusion to this essay and its relevance: 'Yes, we need heroes. But we don't need a Lone Ranger who singlehandedly saves the day.' When we make the hero a solitary figure we forget the cooperative nature of medicine and public health. There are no solitary heroes in the struggle with endemic and pandemic disease, just the many who struggle to treat them and understand their nature. 26 If we are to learn anything from Parkes' careful review and from Snow's passionate if incomplete work, it is this: research is collaborative and cooperative, not individualistic. It includes our fiercest critics and most ardent supporters. In the dilemma that is endemic or epidemic disease, it's not about us, our ideas, but about the disease and our communal means of understanding these conditions. To ignore Snow's failings because we want a simple hero is to assure the failure of the science we promote and practise. It is to assure that public health disasters will follow.",

            "text": "Conflict of interest: None declared. John Snow's On the Mode of Communication of Cholera 1 is one of the most famous works in the history of epidemiology. It first appeared as a modest pamphlet in 1849 in the midst of Britain's second epidemic of cholera. A second and more substantial edition appeared in 1855 following another but smaller outbreak, and it is this second edition for which Snow is remembered today. Edmund Alexander Parkes was a logical choice to review Snow's second edition. As a member of the Army Medical Service in India and Burma, Parkes had seen cholera where it was endemic, and he had published substantial pieces on the pathology and therapy of cholera, dysentery and hepatitis. When he returned to England in the middle 1840s and received his appointment as an assistant physician at University College Hospital, London, he had a reputation as an up-and-coming medical authority on epidemic diseases and hygiene. By 1855, when he reviewed Snow, he was first physician at University College Hospital and Professor of Clinical Medicine at University College. He later became Professor of Military Hygiene at the Army Medical School at Netley. Before his early death at age 57, he would serve as editor of the British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review, as Goulstonian Lecturer to the Royal College of Physicians and as a member of the General Medical Council, and be elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London. 2 In short, Parkes was an established authority on epidemic diseases and hygiene. In fact Snow cites Parkes's pathological work in his second edition. 3 Parkes's views were certainly informed and mainstream in the mid 1850s. His critique of Snow's work is consequently useful in helping us understand how Snow's contemporaries reacted initially to his cholera theory, and perhaps more importantly, it underlines the magnitude of the conceptual changes Snow's work represents.",
