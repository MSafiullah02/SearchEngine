The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, ongoing Zika and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemics, and fear of pandemic influenza highlight the need to understand the drivers of emerging pathogens. The development of innovative approaches that detect, manage, and ultimately prevent outbreaks is crucial in our changing geographic climate (Groen and Calderhead, 2015). Professionals in the area of emerging infectious diseases gather at international meetings to disseminate the latest research findings, discuss ongoing outbreaks, and take part in educational opportunities (Lassmann and Madoff, 2016). Given the multidisciplinary nature of emerging infectious diseases, these gatherings provide a valuable mix of veterinarians, physicians, public health professionals, and researchers, as each specialty contributes a unique insight to pressing problems. To capitalize on the potential reserved in these intellectual meetings, participatory programs were sought to advance the field of infectious diseases. The hackathon model was identified as being uniquely suited for this setting (DePasse et al., 2014).",

Derived from the words \u2018hacking\u2019 and \u2018marathon\u2019, it was initially started in the IT community to accelerate the development of novel software technologies. Since its introduction, the model has been applied to a number of different professional fields, including public health, to foster and accelerate innovation (Groen and Calderhead, 2015, Ostrovsky and Barnett, 2014, Walker and Ko, 2016). Not intended to be solely educational or social, hackathons focus on creating practical, usable solutions that attract funding and program support, which lead to product development. Bringing a broad range of disciplines to bear on a specific challenge, participants are able to apply non-traditional methods to achieve unconventional solutions (Asch et al., 2014).",

Additionally, experts from various disciplines are involved in providing teams with real-time feedback and guidance, resulting in immediate project changes (DePasse et al., 2014). Small multidisciplinary teams collaborate intensely over a short period to define a problem, devise a solution, and design a working prototype (Aboab et al., 2016, MIT, 2016). For hackathons at international infectious disease meetings, a diverse audience representing multiple professions, different career stages, and geographic regions ensures that projects address relevant economic, cultural, and infrastructure barriers. Within teams, participants are encouraged to voice their opinions and contribute their experiences to devise solutions that are applicable across numerous barriers.",

For this reason, the IMED 2016 Hackathon organizers needed to first educate the target population about the hackathon concept in order to attract talented event participants. Onsite event logistics ran smoothly, with extensive participant interaction and team formation happening with little organizer facilitation. With regard to the post-event environment, sustained collaboration between event organizers and hackathon teams proved challenging. Teams designated a contact person to streamline communication and enhance support efforts. A select few teams took to this role, but sustained communication between all teams was not achieved. E-mail lists and registries of event participants were used to facilitate communication; however, these methods were unsuccessful with limited use.",

Partnerships with local organizations and academic centers are essential to attract participants with complementing skills, such as IT, engineering, and entrepreneurship.
