There are significant health benefits to an active lifestyle, particularly when regularly commuting by bike or foot [2]. However, as with any form of outdoor active recreation and mobility, there is an associated risk of traumatic events to the participants. Beck et al. found a relative risk of 2.3 for a fatal injury while bicycling compared to fatal injury of a vehicle occupant in a motor vehicle collision [3]. The perception and reality of this increased risk may be a barrier for many who would otherwise enjoy the freedom and exhilaration of bicycling.",

Between the years 2007 and 2016, Minneapolis saw a 49% increase in the number of bicyclists on city streets and trails [5]. Much of this increase was likely due to the overall cultural trend of cycling as an appealing and popular form of exercise and recreation. In addition to this, the city of Minneapolis was a participant in the \u201cNonmotorized Transportation Pilot Program\u201d which was a federally-funded bill through the US Department of Transportation. This provided $25 million to each of four communities in the US from 2007 through 2009 to demonstrate the ability of infrastructure changes to increase rates of cycling and walking [6].",

            "text": "The data clearly shows an increased number of cyclists in Minneapolis, but there are drawbacks to this increase in shared road space. Cycling alongside larger motorized vehicles results in increased injury severity when a crash does occur [7]. Previous studies suggest that making bicycle safety infrastructure changes can reduce injury risk [8, 9]. In 2011, the city developed a bicycle master plan with a goal of reducing bicycle-motorist crashes by 10% [10]. As a result, the city has continued to invest heavily in yearly increases in cycling boulevard designations, off-street bike paths, and physically-separated bicycling lanes on existing city streets. These factors combine to place the Minneapolis metropolitan area in a unique position to evaluate the effects of infrastructure changes on bicycle crashes. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether bicycling infrastructure changes in the city of Minneapolis effectively reduced the incidence or severity of traumatic bicycling-related injuries sustained by patients admitted to our Level 1 Trauma Center. We hypothesize that the increase of bikeway miles will demonstrate significant reductions in injury severity associated with cycling accidents.",

Patient demographics, mode of arrival, Abbreviated Injury Severity Scale (AIS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) status, mechanical ventilator days, helmet use, alcohol or drug use, mechanism of injury, and discharge disposition were all coded into the database.

This coincided with Minneapolis\u2019 strategic plan to improve motorist/cyclist collisions in 2011. We were also able to utilize data from the city regarding estimated daily bicyclist traffic at a representative selection of intersections that were tracked on an annual basis [11]. The total number of miles of bikeway in the city on a yearly basis was used to demonstrate the change in cycling infrastructure.",

This corresponded with an increase in the number of miles of protected bike lanes established by the city over a similar time period, from 113 miles in 2005 to 245 miles in 2017. The City also committed to decrease bicyclist motorist crashes by 10% in the 2011 Bicycle Master Plan [10].

We did not establish a decrease in the actual rate of cyclist crashes vs numbers of riders as has been previously been reported [16].
