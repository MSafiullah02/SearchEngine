This approach is critical especially in immunosuppressed patients given their relative vulnerability to a multitude of infectious processes. Although rare, oddball infections with rare viruses and fungi can significantly affect the clinical course and recovery of patients if timely diagnosis is delayed.

Negative blood cultures do no entirely exclude an infection because the sensitivity is only about 50%, and cultures can take as long as 4 days to become positive. Thus, prompt treatment should be initiated based on clinical evaluation. Common serologic tests include galactomannan and1,3 B-D-glucan that can be obtained while awaiting blood cultures. Galactomannan is detected in body fluids and a galactomannan index is calculated based on the concentration. When a certain minimum threshold is surpassed, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is made. B-D glucan is a cell wall component found in body fluid and indicates the probability of infection although it fails to discriminate between colonization and infection. Moreover, these tests are specific but they lack sensitivity [2]. Additionally, depending on the location of suspected infection, thoracentesis, interventional radiology guided drainage or aspiration, diagnostic paracentesis, or bronchoalveolar lavages can be obtained to help guide treatment decisions although these techniques are invasive. In cases of aspergillosis infection of the lung, radiographic signs such as the halo sign can be suggestive but not necessarily diagnostic. Moreover, histopathology can be useful in identifying certain species, e.g., periodic acid-Schiff stains for Mucor, and Grocott-methenamine-silver for yeastlike fungus .",
