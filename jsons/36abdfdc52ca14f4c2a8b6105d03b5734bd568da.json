            "text": "The widespread antigenic changes lead to the emergence of a new type of coronavirus (CoV) called as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 that is immunologically different from the previous circulating species. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) is one of the most important receptors on the cell membrane of the host cells (HCs) which its interaction with spike protein (SP) with a furincleavage site results in the SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Hence, in this review, we presented an overview on the interaction of ACE-2 and furin with SP. As several kinds of CoVs, from various genera, have at their S1/S2 binding site a preserved site, we further surveyed the role of furin cleavage site (FCS) on the life cycle of the CoV. Furthermore, we discussed that the small molecular inhibitors can limit the interaction of ACE-2 and furin with SP and can be used as potential therapeutic platforms to combat the spreading CoV epidemic. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future prospects for the development of potential drugs to promote targeting specific activities of the CoV were reviewed. In conclusion, this review may pave the way for providing useful information about different compounds involved in improving the effectiveness of CoV vaccine or drugs with minimum toxicity against human health.",

            "text": "At the end of December 2019, Chinese public health officials announced to the World Health Organization (WHO) that a new and unknown virus caused a disease with symptoms similar to pneumonia in Wuhan (Khan & Fahad, 2020) . They immediately recognized that the virus was from the coronavirus (CoV) family and was rapidly spreading out of Wuhan. The WHO is seeking to identify, track and restrict a new disease from the CoV family called CoV disease 2019 , which is still affecting many peoples in China and outbreaking to other countries. This type of CoV is also spreading in other countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea (Memberships & Join, 2020) . With the number of CoVs currently increasing, the researchers are trying to figure out what is the main cause of the virus to spread easily and widely. Some genetic and structural analyzes have identified the main characteristic of the virus, which could increase the efficiency and speed of virus transmission between human cells (Belouzard et al., 2012; Jaimes & Whittaker, 2018) . Also, some groups are investigating a receptor on cell membranes that introduces the fusion of new CoV into human HCs (Veljkovic et al., 2020; Zheng & Perlman, 2018) . Both the cellular and protein receptors of the virus provide potential targets for development of drugs against pathogen (Kaufmann et al., 2018; Papadopoulos et al., 2017) . However, some welldeveloped experiments and promising data are required to ensure such a mechanism. Indeed, exploring the transmission mechanism of the virus is important to prevent its future outbreaks. The COVID-19 spreads much more easily than the SARS virus and infecting easily the people have been already infected with SARS Lai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Genomic analysis of the new CoV has shown that its SP differs from that of other viruses (Du et al., 2017; Li, 2016) , indicating that the protein has a site activated by a HC enzyme called furin (Millet & Whittaker, 2015) (Figure 1 ). This enzyme normally cleaves and activates a wide range of substrates in different organisms ( Figure 2a ) (Braun & Sauter, 2019) . This enzyme is found in many human tissues, including the lungs, liver and small intestine, which means that the virus has the potential to invade different organs (Belouzard et al., 2012; Heald-Sargent & Gallagher, 2012; Scamuffa et al., 2006) . The furin activation site (FAS) makes the new CoV much different in cell entry than SARS, and probably affects the stability of the virus and, consequently, the transmission process (Li et al., 2015; Millet & Whittaker, 2014; Yamada & Liu, 2009) . Several other groups have also identified the site of activation to investigate how the virus spreads among humans (Basak et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2016; Kleine-Weber et al., 2018; Porter et al., 2014) . They pointed out that other viruses including influenza family viruses contain these sites that are easily spread among people (Huang et al., 2011; Menachery et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2020; Vlasak et al., 1988 ) . But in these viruses, the site of activation is found on a protein called haemagglutinin, not on the SP (Bernstein et al., 2020; Koopman et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2019) . However, some other researchers are more cautious about the significant role of the activation site in helping CoV and facilitating its spread (Amer et al., 2018; Van Doremalen et al., 2013) . Other scientists are also skeptical of comparing the influenza viral activation sites with the new CoV transmission channels (Heymann & Shindo, 2020; Yang et al., 2005) . The haemagglutinin protein at the surface of influenza viruses is not the same as the SP in CoVs (Yin et al., 2016; Zmora et al., 2018) .",

Scientist have pointed out that among several targets, the SP as fusogenic envelope glycoprotein of SARS CoV, is a promising site for treatment of infectious diseases (Li et al., 2018; Licitra et al., 2013) . SPs mediate CoV fusion and the entry of the CoV genetic material into the human cell (Senathilake et al., 2020; Struck et al., 2012) . Afterwards, a SP-selective strategy, when used at the initial phase of CoV infection is probably considered as a potential approach to mitigate infection inside the body. The furin induces the cleavage of SPs at the RNTR761#EV site (Bergeron et al., 2005) and results in the production of two segments: S1 and S2 ( Figure 2b ); each segment shows its own biological activity. The S1 segment known as the globular section of SP mediates attachment of CoV to the receptor, ACE-2 with dominance of a-helix structures (Li et al., 2003) . A 193-resdiue fragment of SP has been determined as the protein-binding site (Wong et al., 2004) . S2, known as the biomembrane-anchored stalk domain and leads to CoV-human cell fusion (Prabakaran et al., 2004) . Some other experiments also exhibited that other biomembrane-anchored proprotein convertases (PrCos), namely PoCo5B and PoCo7 cleave SPs .",

(2007) employing intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic (IQF) proteins relied on SARS-CoV SP claimed that PoCo5B and PoCo7 beside furin may result in the cleavage of SPs. Kinetic studies showed that the cleavage of peptide occurred potentially by furin as well as recombinant PoCo5B, but with a limited amount by PoCo7. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the cleavage activity could be inhibited by a PoCo-inhibitor, a1-PDX. Circular dichroism intensities revealed that the content of b-sheet conformation in PoCo increases after cleavage by furin ( Figure 2c ). 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy displayed that this peptide has a turn motif at its C-terminal part, close to the cleavage site. Coutard et al. (2020) revealed that the SP of the SARS-CoV-2 possesses a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade. The genome sequence revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is included in lineage b of b-CoV ( Figure 3a ). Chen et al. (2020) presented that SARS-CoV-2 as a newly detected CoV shows a high level of similarity to SARS-CoV. The structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SP from the two viruses show 72% similarity in residue sequences ( Figure 3b ). Molecular modeling studies depicted that SARS-CoV-2 RBD provides a stronger attachment with ACE-2. They found that a distinct Phe residue plays a key role in the in the binding site due to its interaction with ACE-2.",

An important phase in the life cycle of the CoV is the human cell entry and fusion derived from proteolytic activity of the relative fusion protein (FP) by respective proteases (Jaimes & Whittaker, 2018) . A conventional approach to explore the CoV life cycle is to clone the FP gene into an appropriate vector, transfect the cells, incubate with the related protease, purify the protein and carry out the protein assays (Cong et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019) . This approach shows a number of drawbacks: the need of viral genome, expensive synthesizing process, availability of monoclonal antibodies, and time-consuming process. Therefore, Jaimes et al.

The theoretical analysis of FCS and the case alignment of CoV family determined that FCS may be a crucial site of CoV evolution. ZJ01 showed mutations close to FCS (F1-2), which led to alterations in the conformation and the charge distribution on the surface of the SP. They employed Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) analysis and exhibited that the binding site of furin was covered with a number of negative residues (Figure 4a ). The F1 site of SARS-CoV-2, namely ZJ01, Wuhan-Hu-1 and RaTG13 were almost covered with positive moieties while SARS was covered by both mixed negative and positive residues. F1 site of ZJ01 showed more positive charge distribution in its head and more negative residues in its basal site in comparison with Wuhan-Hu-1. (Basak et al., 2007) .

GZ02 presented a number of negative charge distribution in F3 site while limited negative charge distribution was observed in SARS-CoV-2-associated virus (Figure 4a) .

In a point of fact, ACE-2 can induce a protective impact against CoV-stimulated lung damage by enhancing the formation of the vasodilator angiotensin . Indeed, the attachment of the SP of the CoV to the ACE-2 triggers a reduction in the levels of ACE-2 , most likely stimulating lung injury. Xu et al. (2017) reported that vitamin D can be used as a potential candidate to mitigate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung damage via control of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, it could be suggested that vitamin D can control the outbreak of CoV through inhibition of ACE-2. Gurwitz (2020) claimed that angiotensin receptor blockers can be used as promising SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Also, it has been suggested that probable way of fighting the CoV could be the injection of ACE-2 which will result in the preventing the interaction of the CoV to off-infected cells and replenishing ACE-2 in infected cells . Some other studies have indicated a close correlation between hypertension and heart disease and CoV infection which may be associated with the prescription of ACE-2 inhibitors (Fang et al., 2020) . Indeed, treatment of CoV infection with ACE-2 inhibitors leads to an upregulation of this receptor especially by epithelial cells of the lung followed by facilitation of infection with different kinds of SARS-CoV .",

Furthermore, it can be deduced that small molecular and ligands inhibitors that can limit the interaction of ACE-2 with RBD should be developed to combat the spreading CoV epidemic Senathilake et al., 2020) . Isolating and cultivating CoV in vitro may not usually be practical or demand particular facilities that are not accessible in every bioresearch laboratory. Therefore, there is a necessity for developing some strategies to assay the human health response to spread of emerging CoV that can be performed in normal laboratory systems. Apart from viruses targeting humans, several animal viruses also have identical FPs, hence, exhibiting the comparable features than their human sites. Purifying these kinds of viruses can display some inevitable biological challenges, making the application of pioneering devices to examine them unavoidable.",

Also, SARS-CoV-2 furin substrate site can facilitate the cleavage of the SP. This review discussed an overview on the role of ACE-2 and furin in the binding of CoV with HC biomembrane mediated by SP. Also, we surveyed the contribution of FCS on the CoV outbreak.
