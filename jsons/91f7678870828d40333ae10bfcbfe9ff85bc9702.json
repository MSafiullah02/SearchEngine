            "text": "History provides us with some dramatic examples of the impact that a new infectious disease can have when it meets human populations with little or no immunity to the disease. In the Americas, Australia, Africa and the Pacific, indigenous populations were decimated in the years following the arrival of Europeans who brought with them germs and diseases such as smallpox, to which the local populations had no immunity (Diamond 1998, 210-4) . Of course, European populations have not been immune to the ravages of infectious disease either. Onequarter of Europe's population was lost in the mid-fourteenth century to bubonic plague (id., 202) , while the influenza epidemic at the end of the First World War killed an estimated twenty-one million people worldwide (ibid.). Furthermore, exposure to new tropical diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, presented serious challenges to European attempts to colonize tropical areas (id., 214). Humanity has a long history, both in fighting infectious diseases and in searching for effective treatments or cures. 1 Infectious diseases continue to reshape human society. Estimates from WHO indicate that in 2001 there were 14.7 million deaths caused by infectious diseases, a figure which accounted for 26 percent of total global mortality (Kindhauser 2003, 6) . AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined accounted for 39 percent of deaths due to infectious diseases. These three diseases led to 5.6 million deaths in 2001. When the 5.8 million deaths from diarrhoeal disease and respiratory infections are also counted, five diseases caused 78 percent of the total infectious diseases burden (ibid.). Many of these diseases impact disproportionately on the world's poorest countries.",

(Farmer and Campos 2004, 247) The significance of SARS is, also, its role as an indicator of the world's preparedness for the next global pandemic. Unlike other outbreaks of infectious disease that have eventually burned out, been geographically limited or susceptible to modern drugs or vaccines, the SARS epidemic was characterized by ready human-to-human transmission, the global spread of the disease (facilitated by international air travel), and the lack of any effective treatment or vaccine (Fidler 2004, 6) . In this context then, \"SARS posed a public health governance challenge the likes of which modern public health had not previously confronted\" (ibid.).",

In this age of global integration, outbreaks of infectious disease in one country can spread rapidly to other countries and even countries with sophisticated health infrastructures are not immune.

An outbreak of an infectious disease on board generally resulted in the ship being quarantined on its arrival in port. 2 With international air travel the time needed for an infectious disease to spread from one country to another is only as long as a trip on an airplane (Frenk and G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 2002, 95) . When we combine this potential with the number of airline journeys each year, 3 the difficulties in containing the spread of infectious diseases within the global village become apparent. The modern context for infectious diseases is evident from a comparison between two diseases: \"It took smallpox centuries just to cross the Atlantic; a few weeks after arriving in Hong Kong from Guangdong, SARS had already spread to 30 countries on five continents\" (National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health 2003, 197) .",

The screening of airline passengers for signs of illness and stories of quarantine were the images that captured media attention. Even in unaffected countries, governments responded by ensuring that public health laws were adequate to meet the challenge of SARS. In Australia, which was relatively unaffected by SARS, the federal government made SARS a quarantinable disease, 4 while state governments also amended their public health legislation to ensure that SARS was covered. 5 With the reemergence of quarantine as a control measure in affected areas, the SARS crisis highlighted the tensions that can exist between public health and private rights (Mitka 2003) . The history of quarantine tells the story of these tensions. With SARS and other new infectious diseases, quarantine is again being considered as a potentially important public health tool and the ethical issues raised by such measures are also receiving attention (ibid.). Surveillance, contact tracing, and travel restrictions, as well as isolation and quarantine, were important public health tools in the efforts to control the SARS outbreak and these measures also have implications for the rights of individuals (Gostin, Bayer and Fairchild 2003; Singer et al. 2003) .",

Furthermore, since they only apply to three diseases -cholera, plague and yellow fever -the IHR do not apply to other infectious diseases that may also have serious implications for international public health. \"Thus, the only international agreement on infectious diseases binding on WHO member states has been irrelevant to the SARS outbreak\" (Fidler 2003a ). Yet the current IHR have other shortcomings as well: they are dependent on affected countries making official notifications to WHO of cases of disease; there are few mechanisms in the IHR to foster collaboration between WHO and countries affected by diseases with the potential to spread internationally; the IHR lack mechanisms to encourage compliance by Member States; and WHO does not have the power to proscribe measures which will limit the international spread of disease (WHO 2002, 3) .",

These Regulations will come into force in 2007, two years after the date they were approved by the Assembly. Under the new International Health Regulations, Member States are required to assess public health events within their territory using an algorithm contained in the IHR. A Member State is required to notify WHO \"of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory\" (Article 6(1)). Cases of certain listed diseases, including SARS and smallpox, must be notified to WHO. Other events must be assessed in terms of the seriousness of their public health impact, whether the event is unusual or unexpected, whether there is a significant risk of international spread, and whether there is a significant risk of international trade or travel restrictions.",

With the crisis having passed there is now the opportunity to reflect upon both domestic and international public health laws and to assess their adequacy for future health emergencies. The revision of the IHR and their new focus on public health emergencies of international concern is a important move away from specific diseases and towards a more flexible and responsive regulatory framework for infectious diseases. Yet this is only a small step towards global preparedness. Reducing the global burden of infectious diseases, particularly in developing countries, focusing on building public health infrastructure and capacity, and strengthening the frameworks for scientific collaboration and public health research are also vital steps towards an effective global response. Globalization does lead to an increased sharing of health risks in relation to infectious diseases. Only time will tell whether our domestic and international public health measures and public health laws will be adequate to respond to the next global health emergency in ways that are both effective and able to strike a balance between individual and community interests.",
