This new viral pneumonia, COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), spread rapidly and developed into a global pandemic within three months from its initial detection [1\u20133]. Among other symptoms, those of COVID-19 often include fever and dry cough, which resemble respiratory illnesses caused by other viruses or bacteria [4\u20137]. Due to the overlapping manifestations, clinical diagnosis becomes problematic, especially during seasonal flu [8], why confirmation of COVID-19 depends on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).",

Due to the limited testing in many geographical regions, it is clear that the total number of actual COVID-19 cases is much higher than the number of confirmed ones. In most of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, the patients are symptomatic showing fever, dry cough, and pneumonia, but also more atypical symptoms such as gastrointestinal manifestations as well as anosmia and ageusia. However, the virus has been detected in completely asymptomatic individuals, e.g. in a recent study from Italy, showing that 44% of the laboratory-confirmed cases lacked symptoms [10]. The knowledge concerning the actual number of asymptomatic vs. symptomatic infections is still limited. The same is true for the potentially growing herd immunity, where almost no data is available to date.",

This means that in the PCR-positive cases for which antibodies may not yet had time to develop, or in potential cases with immune defects, it is possible that the negative IgM or IgG results were in fact true negatives. If this was the case for one or more of the included patients, the actual sensitivities should be higher, i.e. when evaluated only on samples known to contain detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and/or IgG.

However, larger studies on the detailed kinetics of the antibody responses (e.g. IgA, IgM, IgG, neutralizing antibodies) are now urgently needed for a better understanding of the dynamics of the immune response during COVID-19. The results of our study showed detectable IgM and IgG in some patients at day 9, while in other patients the seroconversion seems to occur later. The impact of early or late seroconversion on the case severity is not known, and must now be explored. Interestingly, there were no IgM positives that were not IgG positive. Generally, IgM is produced first, and later there is a switch towards IgG production [13], but studies on SARS-CoV suggest that IgM and IgG often develop around the same time [14,15]. Our results are in line with this (Figure 1), but more detailed studies on long-term sequential samples from patients are now needed. It may be worth looking into whether this is a problem with the test, or a constant finding within the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.",

This sample was re-tested and the result was consistent, indicating a cross-reaction to another coronavirus. Serological cross-reactions have earlier been observed between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [16]. There are other human coronaviruses (NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1) that are globally endemic or epidemic [17], and it may be possible that this reaction represented a cross-reaction due to a previous infection with one of those. Human CoV NL63 has been shown to use the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [18], which may indicate potential cross-reactive epitopes. How common the CoVs are as causative agents for \u2018common colds\u2019 is not known in detail, but there has been estimates that up to 20% of cases could be caused by CoVs [19].",

In contrast to Li et al. [11], we found less indications for using this test for clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, it might contribute to detecting potential asymptomatic infections as well as getting a notion of the magnitude of the spread in different geographical areas, which might be a key to taking the appropriate decisions and policies forward. The high negative predictive value indicates that the rapid test will be useful for detecting past infections and possible immunity, which may be crucial for restoring social functions after lockdown.",
