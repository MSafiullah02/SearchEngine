            "text": "In recent years, attempts to discover evolutionary relationships between different groups of parasitic braconid wasps have made increasing use of novel characters and character systems. Among these are morphological studies of the final instar larval head capsule (e.g. Capek 1970), male genitalia (e.g. Belokobylskij 1987; Quicke 1998), internal and external ovipositor features (1992a, 1992b, 1994; Rahman et al. 1998a,, b), and venom apparatus (Edson & Vinson 1979; 1997, 1992c). Information derived from such studies has proved useful in phylogenetic analyses at a range of taxonomic levels, from subfamily (e.g. Quicke & van Achterberg 1990; Whitfield 1992; van Achterberg & Quicke 1993; Quicke & Belshaw 1999; Dowton et al. 2002) to genus level (e.g. Belshaw et al. 2001; S.

            "text": "As regards venom apparatus morphology in the Braconidae, Edson & Vinson (1979) first noted a major difference between that of the cyclostome group of subfamilies which have a heavily muscularized (type 1) venom reservoir whose intima is strongly spirally sculptured, and that of the non\u2010cyclostomes which is far less muscularized and has a smooth intima. Quicke & van Achterberg (1990) provided additional data and scored additional features in their phylogenetic analysis of braconid subfamilies. Different component structures of the venom apparatus were subsequently shown to vary greatly both within and between two large groups of cyclostome braconid wasps, the Doryctinae (Quicke et al. 1992c) and the Opiinae + Alysiinae (Quicke et al. 1997), in each case providing indications of previously unsuspected relationships. Moreover, although in these two works no variation was encountered in the venom apparatus of the large subfamily Braconinae, they suggested that it might provide phylogenetic information concerning the members of an ill\u2010defined group of subfamilies that has been referred to as the Rogadinae sensu lato. The Rogadinae sensu lato constitutes one of the most problematic groups of braconids in terms of its taxonomy due to the considerable morphological and biological heterogeneity shown by its members (Shaw & Huddleston 1991). More recently, some authors have split the Rogadinae sensu lato into several small subfamilies, e.g. Exothecinae, Hormiinae, Lysiterminae, Mesostoinae (in part, namely Hydrangeocolini), Pambolinae, Rhyssalinae, and Rhysipolinae (see Quicke & van Achterberg 1990; van Achterberg 1995; Belshaw & Quicke 2002), although some of these are still morphologically heterogeneous and also dubiously monophyletic because of the absence of clear synapomorphies.",

Although mummification of the host larva is regarded as a synapomorphy that distinguishes members of the Rogadinae sensu stricto, the lack of morphological synapomorphies among its members has not allowed a proper definition for it (although most taxa have fairly distinctive Gestalt). In the present work, we describe several previously unreported features of venom apparatus morphology in various genera of the Rogadinae sensu lato and other potentially related cyclostome braconids. Based on the information obtained, we performed a preliminary phylogenetic analysis for this group. Despite the limited amount of information, we show that this character system seems to provide valuable phylogenetic information at a variety of taxonomic levels.",

Furthermore, specimens of some genera belonging to the Rogadinae sensu lato (e.g. Allobracon Gahan, Lysitermus Foerster, Pentatermus Hedqvist, Hormius Blanchard), and specimens from other potentially related subfamilies (e.g. Telengainae) whose venom apparatus was not previously known, were incorporated and discussed. Two of the venom apparatus preparations included in this study [Hormius moniliatus (Nees) and Aleiodes ruficornis (Herrich\u2010Schaeffer) = A. dimidiatus (Spinola)] were those previously examined by Falco Gari (1991).

Nevertheless, there are some characters that distinguish members of the Rogadini from the remaining tribes of the Rogadinae sensu stricto. The Rogadini, which is by far the most diverse tribe in the Rogadinae sensu stricto, currently comprises two subtribes, the Rogadina and the Spinariina, the first being much more diverse and widespread than the second. Members of the Rogadini are defined by having the inner sides of the eyes emarginate, the second tergite usually with a triangular or semicircular mediobasal area, and a short ovipositor sheath (van Achterberg 1991). The venom apparatus in the specimens of the Rogadini examined usually consists of a wide venom reservoir (e.g. 2, 3), a wide primary venom duct (e.g. Figs 2F\u2013H, 6E; except some Aleiodes, e.g. Fig. 2A,B), a short and wide secondary venom duct (e.g. Fig. 1A,B; except Pholichora van Achterberg and some Rogas Nees, see below), and glands well differentiated and often numerous (e.g. 2, 3). Although a short and wide secondary venom duct is also present in most species of the Opiinae and Alysiinae, the gland ducts in these taxa are not tubular and the venom glands are often undifferentiated with respect to their ducts (Quicke et al. 1997).",

These filaments are arranged in a cone which we suggest acts as a valve for controlling the flow of venom from the glands to the reservoir, potentially limiting back\u2010flow when the reservoir muscles contract to expel venom during host manipulation (Fig. 7A\u2013C). The presence of thick muscle around the secondary venom duct (Fig. 6A,B) suggests that the wasp may be able to control the opening of the filament cone. No similar structure has been observed in any other group of braconids and therefore in our phylogenetic hypothesis it appears as a synapomorphy that defines this tribe.",

A setal comb on the inner side of the apex of the hind tibia is found in most of those genera with a thickened and short secondary venom duct, and is absent in those with a soft secondary venom duct and also in Pholichora, which has a distinctive duct (Fig. 6E). The only exception is A. seriatus, which also has a setal comb but has a soft secondary venom duct as in the other examined species of Aleiodes. Furthermore, in two subsets of genera, two other external morphological characters show a high degree of congruence with the thickened secondary venom duct, these being a basally widened first metasomal tergite which is present in Canalirogas, Colastomion, Macrostomion, and Myocron, and curved and largely glabrous hind tibial spurs in Colastomion, Cystomastacoides, Macrostomion, Megarhogas, Myocron, and Rectivena. Finally, although not recovered as monophyletic in our analysis, members of the Spinariina, which are characterized by a disproportionately small and transverse head and by the metasomal tergites being united to form a carapace and bearing spines (Chen & He 1997), are the only genera which have a thickened secondary venom duct inserted at the midlength of the reservoir (Fig. 1B; see also Quicke et al. 1992c: fig. 8C). However, because these genera share the probably derived thickened hard secondary venom duct with several other Rogadini genera, it seems that the Spinariina is just a derived genus group within a larger group of genera.",

            "text": "With more than 300 described species, the cosmopolitan genus Aleiodes is the largest genus of the Rogadinae sensu stricto (Chen & He 1997). Members of Aleiodes are known usually to oviposit into second or early third instar larvae of several macrolepidopteran families and kill the host before it becomes fully grown (Shaw 1983; Shaw & Huddleston 1991). Although many species of Aleiodes have in the past been placed in Rogas (e.g. Shaw 1983), the latter name is correctly applied to a different group and both generic names are considered as valid (van Achterberg 1991; Shaw 1997). However, owing to the occurrence of aberrant character states within Aleiodes, the distinction between even the true Rogas and Aleiodes can be problematic, with few consistent or convincing characters to separate them, such that keys to genera rely heavily or entirely on the presence of a large pointed basal lobe to the claws in Rogas. From our study, based on the differences in the secondary venom duct mentioned above, it seems that Aleiodes and Rogas are each more closely related to other genera of Rogadini than to each other. Unlike all other Rogadini, Cordylorhogas and all species of Aleiodes, except for A. dispar and A. spp. 4 and 5 (see below), have the secondary venom duct evidently recessed and with numerous, well\u2010defined internal filaments (Fig. 4B\u2013D). Despite the fact that one of the terminal taxa with a recessed secondary venom duct is nested outside the clade comprising the rest of the taxa with this condition (species of Aleiodes with type C venom apparatus, see below), this arrangement is apparently unique within the Braconidae and probably represents a synapomorphy for these two genera. Although not recovered in our phylogenetic hypothesis, variation in the venom apparatus between the species of Rogas from Old and New Worlds has also revealed a marked dichotomy. Whereas the gland ducts in European and Afrotropical Rogas are symmetrically branched in a similar way to those of the other Rogadini genera (Fig. 3C), those of all five New World Rogas species examined possess an extremely long tubular secondary venom duct that has numerous venom gland sacks inserted along its length and which only bifurcates into the tertiary ducts near to its end (Fig. 3A,B). The relative length of the secondary venom duct varies among the New World species, being relatively longer in larger species.",

Although type A venom apparatus possesses a series of filaments at the insertion of the secondary venom duct, these are not so well defined in this group and lack a distinctly recessed part of the secondary duct. Van Achterberg (1991) synonymized four small genera with Aleiodes, including Heterogamus Wesmael of which dispar is the type species, because he considered that recognition of all of them as genera would leave the remainder of Aleiodes paraphyletic. The differences in the venom apparatus between A. dispar, with its closely related species, and the other Aleiodes studied suggest that these species represent a basal lineage within Aleiodes, and in the future it may be desirable to resurrect the generic name Heterogamus for them (M. Mori, M. R. Shak & D. L. J. Quicke, unpublished results).",

The venom apparatus in the four examined species of Yelicones does not show any obvious relationship with other taxa (2, 6; see also Quicke et al. 1992c). However, our observations do suggest a possible biogeographical trend within Yelicones. In the Asian species of Yelicones examined, the venom ducts show evident ductules and have a very distinctive form with the secondary ducts medially expanded, which could terminate either in a few or no distinct venom glands (Fig. 6F).

            "text": "The Telengainae and the Exothecinae are two small braconid subfamilies, the first one represented only by the enigmatic genus Telengaia Tobias, which is restricted to Central Asia (Quicke & van Achterberg 1990; van Achterberg 1993), whereas the second one comprises few genera which contain idiobiont ectoparasites of mining larvae of holometabolous insects (Shaw 1983; 1983, 1993). Although Quicke & van Achterberg (1990) stated that the Telengainae lacks any clear morphological synapomorphy with other braconid subfamilies, they hypothesized that it may be closely related to the Gnamptodontinae and to the Braconinae, mainly because of the presence of posteriorly diverging grooves on the third metasomal tergite. Moreover, in this work, the authors demonstrated that the group currently referred to as the Exothecinae does not form part of the Rogadinae sensu stricto. These suggestions are consistent with the features of the venom apparatus observed for the specimens examined belonging to the Telengainae and the Exothecinae. Telengaia and the two members of the Exothecinae (Shawiana van Achterberg and Colastes) were recovered in a clade containing the Braconinae and Gnamptodon of the Gnamptodontinae (Fig. 5). The synapomorphy that supports this clade is the presence of swollen secondary and following venom ducts, more or less gradually developing into gland filaments (RI = 0.33; e.g. Fig. 1I.) This type of gland duct also resembles those observed in most members of the Opiinae and Alysiinae (Quicke et al. 1997). Furthermore, within the latter clade there is a subclade containing the Braconinae, Telengainae and Exothecinae. This clade is supported by the presence of a primary duct densely supplied with ductules that open into a fairly large dome or vase\u2010shaped chamber (RI = 0.33; e.g. Fig. 1I). This same apomorphic condition has also been observed in some species of the Alysiinae (Quicke et al. 1997).",

            "text": "The presence of an unsculptured venom reservoir is a feature apparently fixed in the non\u2010cyclostome braconids with the marked exception of the putatively basal Trachypetinae (Quicke & van Achterberg 1990; 1999, 1992c; Jim\u00e9nez et al. 1997), although it has also been seen in some species of the Aphidiinae, which has proved to be part of a \u2018Gondwanan\u2019 clade that is the sister group of the cyclostome braconids (Belshaw et al. 2000; Dowton et al. 2002). In contrast, all the cyclostome braconids present a pattern of spiral annulation on the venom reservoir which seems to be a derived characteristic that distinguishes this group (Quicke & van Achterberg 1990; 1997, 1992c). In this study, all the taxa included present a venom reservoir with spiral sculpture except one of the two examined species of Avga, the type species A. choaspes (Fig. 1J). Our analysis did not include non\u2010cyclostome taxa, and hence this feature was uninformative. However, it can be observed that the overall morphology of the venom apparatus in the two examined species of Avga (Fig. 1J,K) is more similar to those seen in the Aphidiinae than to those of the Hormiinae. Thus, the possibility that Avga does not form part of the cyclostome group needs to be considered. This finding seems to agree with Wharton's (1993) review of the Hormiini, who observed that A. choaspes and closely related species present some morphological differences with respect to the rest of hormiines. Future critical taxonomic studies are needed to test the monophyly of Avga and the actual taxonomic position of A. choaspes and related species.",
