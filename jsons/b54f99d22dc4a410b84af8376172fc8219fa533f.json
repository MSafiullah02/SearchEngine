There are currently no drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy for its prevention and little knowledge was known about the pathogenicity mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous studies showed both virus and host-derived MicroRNAs (miRNAs) played crucial roles in the pathology of virus infection. In this study, we use computational approaches to scan the SARS-CoV-2 genome for putative miRNAs and predict the virus miRNA targets on virus and human genome as well as the host miRNAs targets on virus genome. Furthermore, we explore miRNAs involved dysregulation caused by the virus infection. Our results implicated that the immune response and cytoskeleton organization are two of the most notable biological processes regulated by the infection-modulated miRNAs. Impressively, we found hsa-miR-4661-3p was predicted to target the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, and a virus-encoded miRNA MR147-3p could enhance the expression of TMPRSS2 with the function of strengthening SARS-CoV-2 infection in the gut. The study may provide important clues for the mechisms of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.",

Humans coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold, e.g. HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HKU1. However, over the past two decades, highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged, including SARS-CoV in 2002 and 2003, which infected 8,000 people worldwide and with a fatality rate of ~10% and MERS-CoV in 2012 with 2,500 confirmed cases and a death rate of 37% 1 . Infection with these highly pathogenic coronaviruses can result in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which may lead to widespread inflammation in the lungs, shortness of breath, and death. Compared to MERS and SARS, SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread more efficiently although with relatively lower mortality of 2%~3% 1,2 . Furthermore, mounting evidence has suggested that the subclinical cases, which show limited to no symptoms but could spread virus as well, may represent a large amount of the infections 3, 4 .",

The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes increased secretion of cytokines, and the main death cause of SARS-CoV-2 is ARDS, for which one of the main mechanisms are the cytokine storm, the deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection 6 .

The miR-HA-3p encoded by H5N1 accentuates the production of antiviral cytokines by targeting and repressing poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) expression, a known negative regulator of RIG/MAVS signaling, resulting in a high level of cytokine production and high mortality 20 . Also, viral miRNAs target the virus genes, which also help the virus to remain hidden from the host immune response. For example, miR-BART2 encoded by EBV was found to lie antisense to the EBV DNA polymerase gene BALF5 and was proposed to inhibit DNA polymerase expression by inducing cleavage within the 3'-UTR of BALF5 21 . Furthermore, given the importance of miRNA in regulating gene networks or pathways, viruses have evolved mechanisms to degrade, boost, or hijack cellular miRNAs to benefit the viral life cycle. Both Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) and Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) bind miR-27 with antisense, leading miR-27 degradation in a sequence-specific and binding-dependent manner, to promote T-cell activation and enhance viral replication, respectively 22, 23 . The non-translated region of North American eastern equine encephalitis virus genome base pairs with the miR-142-3p, resulted in a miR-142-3p mediated innate immune suppression 24 . Moreover, recent studies indicate the virus-encoded miRNAs, host-encoded miRNAs, and miRNA targets together form a novel regulatory system between the virus and the host, which contributes to the outcome of infection 25 . Hence, it is crucial to comprehensively understand the role of the novel regulatory system during SARS-COV-2 infection, then apply this information towards developing both new medicine and repurposing existing ones.",

Human 3\u2032 UTR targets of the mature viral miRNAs were predicted and 40 miRNA were predicted to be binding to the 3\u2032 UTR of 73 genes. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the top functions of the target genes were enriched in the function of Notch binding, single-stranded DNA endodeoxyribonuclease activity, deoxyribonuclease activity, cellular response to peptide hormone stimulus and regulation of fatty acid metabolic process ( Figure   2A ). One of the common related biological processes involved by the notch signaling pathway, DNA endodeoxyribonuclease, and deoxyribonuclease is apoptosis, which is considered as a powerful mechanism to curtail viral spread 37 . However, consequently, viruses have evolved sophisticated molecular strategies to subvert host cell apoptotic defenses. A couple of studies have investigated the mechanism by which viruses modulating apoptosis signaling 16, 38 . The targeted gene annotated to the related GO items included CHAC1 and RAD9A among others, which were targeted by the virus-encoded miRNA, namely MD2-5p and MR147-3p, respectively ( Figure 2B ). CHAC1 (cation transport regulator-like protein 1) is a proapoptotic enzyme and a regulator of Notch signaling. RAD9A is a cell cycle checkpoint protein required for cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair in response to DNA damage. RAD9A interacts with BCL-2/BCL-xL, the most important genes that regulate cell death, and promote apoptosis 39 . The suppressive role of the SARS-CoV-2-encode miRNAs on these genes suggested the possible role of them in reducing the host cell apoptotic to subvert host defense.",

We then downloaded the tissue-specific enhancer sequences from the EnhancerAlta for five tissues which were reported to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e. lung, gut, spleen, liver, and heart. Target prediction revealed that the lung is with the largest number of genes targeted by miRNA on the enhancer, followed by spleen and gut ( Figure 3A ). Functional annotation of these targeted genes revealed a notable enrichment in chemokine signaling pathways and cell skeleton related functions, such as actin filament-based process, actin cytoskeleton organization and cytoskeleton organization in the lung ( Figure 3B ). For example, MR147-5p targeted at the putative enhancer region of CXCL16 and ARRB2. CXCL16 was reported to regulate cell-mediated immunity to salmonella enterica serovar snteritidis via the promotion of gamma Interferon (IFN-\u03b3) production 45 . ARRB2 (arrestin beta-2) plays an important role in inflammation, the deficiency of it abolishes ovalbumin-evoked T lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration of the lungs and eliminates Th2 cytokine production in the lungs. Another category of genes was related to the cell cytoskeleton organization, e.g. MYH9 (myosin-9) and ITGB5 (Integrin beta-5). Actin cytoskeleton is critical for viral replication at many stages of the viral life cycle, and viruses can subvert the force-generating and macromolecular scaffolding properties of the actin cytoskeleton to propel viral surfing, internalization, and migration within the cell 46,47 . These observations suggested the possible role of SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNA in causing increased inflammation in the lung and facilitating the virus invasion.",

Impressively, the systematic analysis revealed that the immune response is the function most affected by the virus-infection introduced miRNA change in repository and targets, which might contribute to the immune evasion of the virus as well as the abnormal immunity activation in the host. The SARS-CoV-2-encoded miRNA is also implicated in the cytoskeleton dynamics that facilitating the virus envision, trafficking within the cell and release. The virus-encode miRNAs were also predicted to be able to repress the expression of genes involved apoptosis and regulating fatty acid metabolic process by binding at the 3\u2032 UTR of host genes. Additionally, the host miRNAs hijacked by the virus genome were mostly involved in the immune system process, such as hsa-miR-146b and hsa-miR-939.",

ADIPOQ is a gene encodes adiponectin, which regulates both glucose and lipid metabolism and exerts an insulin-sensitizing effect in the liver. The binding of adiponectin with its specific receptors, i.e. ADIPOR1/2, induces the activation of a proper signaling cascade that becomes altered in liver pathologies 42 . Zhang et. al reported that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver comorbidities and 14-53% cases reported abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) during disease progression 7 . However, it is unclear whether the liver damage of COVID-2019 patients is caused directly by the viral infection or by the drug toxicity. The analysis implied the liver dysfunction may be impaired by SARS-COV-2 virus infection through the release of virus miRNA.",

SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in the stool of patients 50,51 . The putative activation role of virus-derived MR147-3p might add evidence to the gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2 and provided possible mechanisms for the effective evasion of SARS-CoV-2 into gut cells. The most significant enriched gene function is \"transport\" (Figure 3D).

Another miRNA, miR-939, though no target was predicted, was proposed to regulate proinflammatory genes by experiment. Increasing miR-939 levels should restore homeostasis by decreasing inflammatory protein synthesis 57 .
