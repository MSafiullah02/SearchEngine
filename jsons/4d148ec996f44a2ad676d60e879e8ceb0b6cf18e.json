Prta makes online readers aware of propaganda by automatically detecting the text fragments in which propaganda techniques are being used as well as the type of propaganda technique in use. We believe that revealing the use of such techniques can help promote media literacy and critical thinking, and eventually contribute to limiting the impact of \"fake news\" and disinformation campaigns. appeal to fear/prejudice \u2022 A dark, impenetrable and irreversible winter of persecution of the faithful by their own shepherds will fall. flag-waving \u2022 Mueller attempts to stop the will of We the People!!! It's time to jail Mueller. causal oversimplification \u2022 If France had not have declared war on Germany then World War II would have never happened. slogans \u2022 \"BUILD THE WALL!\" Trump tweeted. appeal to authority \u2022 Monsignor Jean-Franois Lantheaume, who served as first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington, confirmed that \"Vigan said the truth. That's all.\" black-and-white fallacy \u2022 Francis said these words: Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do . . . If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it. obfuscation, Intentional vagueness, Confusion \u2022 Women and men are physically and emotionally different. The sexes are not \"equal,\" then, and therefore the law should not pretend that we are! thought-terminating cliches \u2022 I do not really see any problems there. Marx is the President. whataboutism \u2022 President Trump -who himself avoided national military service in the 1960's-keeps beating the war drums over North Korea. reductio ad hitlerum \u2022 \"Vichy journalism,\" a term which now fits so much of the mainstream media. It collaborates in the same way that the Vichy government in France collaborated with the Nazis. red herring \u2022 \"You may claim that the death penalty is an ineffective deterrent against crime -but what about the victims of crime? How do you think surviving family members feel when they see the man who murdered their son kept in prison at their expense? Is it right that they should pay for their son's murderer to be fed and housed?\" bandwagon \u2022 He tweeted, \"EU no longer considers #Hamas a terrorist group. Time for US to do same.\" straw man \u2022 \"Take it seriously, but with a large grain of salt.\" Which is just Allen's more nuanced way of saying: \"Don't believe it.\" With Prta, users can explore the contents of articles about a number of topics, crawled from a variety of sources and updated on a regular basis, and to compare them on the basis of their use of propaganda techniques. The application reports overall statistics about the occurrence of such techniques, as well as their usage over time, or according to user-defined filtering criteria such as time span, keywords, and/or political orientation of the media. Furthermore, the application allows users to input and to analyze any text or URL of interest; this is also possible via an API, which allows other applications to be built on top of the system.",
