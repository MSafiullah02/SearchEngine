Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as detected by sequencing of the samples was found to be the cause of a severe respiratory disease in humans [1]. The outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in a global epidemic with the number of confirmed cased surpassing 722,000 in March 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome shares about 80% similarity with SARS-CoV and is even more similar (96%) to the bat coronavirus BatCoV RaTG132. Coronaviruses are characterized by large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of their genomes, hence pose a challenge in terms of public health, currently based on 1455 viral genomes and predicted 24.5 genetic substitutions per year [3].",

Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-Cov-2 enters the cell by the means of binding of cellular receptor(s) including the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane bound protein [4]. ACE2 is a type I membrane protein expressed in lungs, heart, kidneys and intestine and decreased expression of ACE2 is associated with cardiovascular diseases [2,5]. The structural basis for this recognition has been recently mapped out and the cryo-EM structure of the full length viral spike protein that targets human ACE2 complex has been reported [2]. The authors show that viral S protein binds ACE2 at least 10 times more tightly, when compared to the spike protein of the previous SARS-CoV strain. The viral spike glycoprotein (S protein) mediates receptor recognition [6]. Recently the 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the S protein has been described [6]. The S protein is cleaved into two subunits: S1 and S2. This cleavage of S protein by host proteases is critical for viral activation and subsequent infection [2].",

Cathepsin L is a peptidase that preferentially cleaves peptide bonds with aromatic residues in P2 and hydrophobic residues in P3 position [9]. CTSL is active at pH 3-6.5, in the presence of thiol and its enzymatic stability is dependent on ionic strength [9]. Cathepsin L proteolysis is a crucial mechanism for Ebola as well as SARS-CoV for processing of viral glycoprotein before cell membrane fusion [8]. Specifically, during cell membrane fusion the S protein is cleaved by host cell proteases, exposing a fusion peptide of the S2 domain. This leads to the fusion of viral and cellular membranes and the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell.",

S2\u2019 cleavage is responsible for unmasking and activating of the fusion peptide. Cleavage at both sites is believed to be necessary for viral entry by endocytosis into the host cell. The S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 is between the threonine and methionine at positions 696 and 697. This S1/S2 cleavage site is identical to that of SARS-CoV which has been shown to be cleaved by Cathepsin L (CTSL), a lysosomal cystein protease encoded by the CTSL1 gene. SARS-CoV-2 also has a furin-like protease cleavage site not found in SARS-CoV, between the arginine and serine at positions 685 and 686. This site may be cleaved by furin during viral egress. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 might be also primed by Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [4]. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 has been shown to suppress SARS-CoV infection. High expression of TMPRSS2 correlates with SARS-CoV infection in the upper lobe of the lung [10]. Interfering with the spike protein processing by the host cell, whether by affecting the environment or modulating gene expression levels, hence offers a potential therapeutic strategy.",

Amantadine inhibits influenza A replication at low micromolar concentration, by blocking M2 ion channel protein which acidifies virus interior and releases its nucleoprotein [13], [14], [15]. It causes pH reduction which abrogates membrane fusion a necessary step for virus replication [13,14]. Other lysosomotropic drugs affect lysosomes through lysosome membrane permeabilization and accumulation also blocking of Ca2+ signaling, and enzyme activity inhibition or storage material accumulation [16]. Since amantadine behaves as a lysosomotropic substance that passes easily through the lysosome membrane of SARS-CoV-2 virus and accumulates in it, tt could lower the pH of lysosome thus inhibit the protease activities [17]. Moreover amantadine may directly affect viral entry bydown-modulating CTSL and other lysosomal pathway genes. The PK profile of the drug makes it particularly suitable for administration to humans. Plasma concentration is in the range of 200-800ng/mL depending on the formulation and dosing regimen. Plasma half-life is 17 hours (range: 10 to 25 hours) with renal clearance as main elimination mechanism. Amantadine HCl immediate release is available as a 100-mg tablet and 50 mg/5 mL syrup and is typically administered twice daily [18].

            "text": "We investigated natural variation of CTSL expression across ethnicities, focusing on common and rare variants. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project [5] provides genotype information and gene expression levels across 49 human tissues from 838 donors, allowing us to examine the expression patterns of CTSL, both across tissues as well as across individuals. Figure 2\nshows expression of CTSL across different organs and associated cell types. CTSL is widely expressed in many crucial organs (increase expression in: lungs, in nerve-tibial, adipose, artery, whole blood and fibroblasts). Looking at expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in CTSL, we have found a very significant and lung specific (rs2378757) variant conferring highly variable expression. The genotype (Supplementary Figure 1a) confers lower baseline expression and is likely associated with a better response and conversely higher expression perhaps higher viral load. In addition, there are several splice quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) (hence variants affecting splicing ratios of transcripts) such as rs114063116 significant and present in the lungs tissue. CTSL genotype-tissue analysis points to potential variants that may constitute susceptibility or resilience to infection of SARS-CoV-2 in certain individuals. Interestingly, the alternative splicing of the CTSL transcript in the lung further displays tissue specific regulatory programs (Supplementary Figure 1b). A recent functional study points to a common variant in CTSL in the proximal CTSL1 promoter, (position C-171A), confirmed to alter transcription via alteration of the xenobiotic response element [20]. This and similar other variants likely affect natural diversity in baseline expression hence viral fitness at cell entry of SARS-Cov-2. Additionally, we checked in the gnomAD [21] database the number of rare variants and variation tolerance status of CTSL. The results show that there are on average 167 missense variants in CTSL and the gene is predicted to be loss-of-function variant tolerant with a pLI of 0.01. Together with significant eQTLs this indicates large effect of genetic variation on CTSL expression. TMPRSS2 is also widely expressed in multiple tissues including those in the GI system, lung, and kidney [5]. The high expression of CTSL and TRMPSS2 transcripts in a series of organs could explain the viral manifestation in these tissues such as recent studies showing viral presence in stool samples from infected individuals as well as effects of the virus seen across multiple tissues [22].",

            "text": "Decreasing the expression of CTSL is likely a potential mechanism that would lower the capacity of the virus to enter the next host cell. Another symbiotic, therapeutic mechanism is lysosomal pH modulationthat would further interfere with proteolytic Spike protein activation. Therapeutic agents capable of perturbing the lysosomes, their function or microenvironment may offer protection from the virus or decrease the severity of the symptoms. Given that amantadine does not only down-regulate CTSL expression, but a number of key lysosomal enzymes, we can now hypothesize that lysosomal dysfunction induced by amantadine administration can be protective against viral entry and ultimately replication. Our hypothesisis that people with certain lysosomal storage diseases are resistant to one of these viruses. Along these lines there is suggestive evidence for this to be true. For example Niemann-Pick disease type C1 lipid storage disorder offers resistance to Ebola in patient cell lines [23,24]. Interestingly, bat species show selective sensitivity to Ebola versus Marburg viruses [25]. The differences are primarily due to amino acid differences in NPC1 protein indicating that the heterogeneity of bat NPC1 orthologs is a crucial factor affecting varied degree of susceptibility [25].",

Amantadine would be predicted by physical and chemical properties to accumulate in the lysosomes and raise pH, interfering with cathepsin L function.  The gene expression pattern reported in this paper suggests that a more general lysosomal program is down-regulated by Amantadine, likely through a common set of transcription factors. Additionally, amantadine's property to accumulate in lysosomes, if effective, could reduce viral load, decrease intra-host organ spread and decrease individual-patient, associated disease severity and progression. Importantly, the dose that was tested in High Throughput Screen Assay is within one order of magnitude of expected pharmacokinetic, clinical profile (\u223c5uM).

It can also be easily grown as monolayer in 96-well plates. Compounds were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or Vanda Pharmaceuticals (Washington, DC). Cells were aliquoted on 96-well plates (\u223c2 \u00d7 10e5 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h prior to providing fresh media with a drug, or the drug vehicle (water, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, methanol, or phosphate-buffered saline solution). Drugs were diluted 1000 fold in buffered in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (D-MEM/F-12) culture medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing nonessential amino acids and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate. In these conditions, no significant changes of pH were expected, which was confirmed by the monitoring of the pH indicator present in the medium. A final 10 \u03bcM drug concentration was chosen because it is believed to fit in the range of physiological conditions [26]. Microscopic inspection of each well was conducted at the end of the treatment to discard any samples where cells had morphological changes consistent with apoptosis. We also verified that the drug had not precipitated in the culture medium.",

Drugs were profiled in duplicate or triplicate, with multiple vehicle controls on each plate. A total of 708 microarrays were analyzed including 74 for the 18 antipsychotics, 499 for the other 448 compounds, and 135 for vehicle controls. The raw scan data were first converted to average difference values using MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix). The average difference values of both treatment and control data were set to a minimum of 50 or lower. For each treatment category, all probe sets were then ranked based on their amplitude, or level of expression relative to the vehicle control (or the average of controls was selected when more than one was used). Amplitude was defined as the ratio of expression (t\u2212v) / [(t+v) / 2] where t corresponds to treatment instance and v to vehicle instance.
