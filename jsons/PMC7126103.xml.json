As can be seen from Table 1, when the amount of the LiClO4 increased from 5 to 10, and 15 mol %, the yields increased from 80 to 95 and 96%, respectively. It was found that 10 mol % LiClO4 in EtOH is sufficient to push this reaction forward (Table 1, entry 2). More amounts of the LiClO4 (15 mol %) did not improve the yields and decreasing the amount of LiClO4 (5 mol %) resulted in a decrease in the yield of 4a and increase in the yield of 5. When this reaction was carried out without LiClO4 the yield of the product was Trace even after 7 h (entry 10).",
