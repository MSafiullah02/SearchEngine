            "text": "Initially described as an interferon (IFN)\u03b3-inducing factor, interleukin (IL)-18 is indeed involved in Th1 and NK cell activation, but also in Th2, IL-17-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and macrophage activation. IL-18, a member of the IL-1 family, is similar to IL-1\u03b2 for being processed by caspase 1 to an 18 kDa-biologically active mature form. IL-18 binds to its specific receptor (IL-18R\u03b1, also known as IL-1R7) forming a low affinity ligand chain. This is followed by recruitment of the IL-18R\u03b2 chain. IL-18 then uses the same signaling pathway as IL-1 to activate NF-kB and induce inflammatory mediators such as adhesion molecules, chemokines and Fas ligand. IL-18 also binds to the circulating high affinity IL-18 binding protein (BP), such as only unbound free IL-18 is active. IL-18R\u03b1 may also bind IL-37, another member of the IL-1 family, but in association with the negative signaling chain termed IL-1R8, which transduces an anti-inflammatory signal. IL-18BP also binds IL-37 and this acts as a sink for the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-37. There is now ample evidence for a role of IL-18 in various infectious, metabolic or inflammatory diseases such as influenza virus infection, atheroma, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Crohn's disease. However, IL-18 plays a very specific role in the pathogenesis of hemophagocytic syndromes (HS) also termed Macrophage Activation Syndrome. In children affected by NLRC4 gain-offunction mutations, IL-18 circulates in the range of tens of nanograms/mL. HS is treated with the IL-1 Receptor antagonist (anakinra) but also specifically with IL-18BP. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease are also characterized by high serum IL-18 concentrations and are treated by IL-18BP.",

Despite binding to different receptors, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 use the same signaling pathways. However, apart from these important similarities, IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 appear to have a different biology. 4, 6, 7 This article is part of a series of reviews covering The IL-1 cytokine and receptor family appearing in Volume 281 of Immunological Reviews.",

            "text": "IL-18 gene is located on chromosome 11 in humans and chromosome 9 in mice whose gene contains 7 exons with two distinct promoters on exon 1 and 2 including an interferon consensus sequence binding protein and a PU.1 binding sites. 5 In contrast to other cytokine genes, IL-18 gene has few RNA-destabilizing elements, resulting in an unusually stable cytokine expression. Transcription of IL-18 precursor can be induced after TLR binding of PAMPs and activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway. IL-18 gene encodes for a 193 amino acids precursor, first synthesized as an inactive 24-kDa precursor with no signal peptide, which accumulates in cell cytoplasm. In contrast with IL-1\u03b2, the IL-18 precursor is constitutively present in blood monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells from healthy subjects. 6, 8 Similarly to IL-1\u03b1 and IL-33, Similarly to IL-1\u03b2, the IL-18 precursor is processed intracellularly by caspase 1 into its mature biologically molecule of 18 kDa. 9,10 For IL-18, the consensus is I-N-D at amino acid 50 but the N-terminus generated by caspase-1 is 14 amino acids before the consensus sequence, rather than 9 amino acids for IL-1\u03b2. Caspase 1 can be activated by various canonical inflammasomes belonging to the Nod-like receptors, AIM2-like receptors or TRIM family containing either a CARD or a PYD domain. 11 Among the best known inflammasomes are NLRP-3, NLRC4, NLRP-1 and AIM2 which sense various danger signals. Caspase 1 activation also results in a cell-death program termed pyroptosis, which induces membrane pores and mature IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 release. Mature IL-1\u03b2 can also be released from the cells by lysosome exocytosis or membrane microvesicles, but it is not clear whether IL-18 used the same pathways. Caspase 1-independent mechanisms of IL-18 cleavage have also been described. Notably, Fas Ligand activation of Fas-expressing Kupffer cells or splenic macrophages from Propiobacterium acnes-infected mice, can process active IL-18 in a caspase 1-independent but caspase 8-mediated fashion. 12, 13 Alternatively, caspase 3 cleaves IL-18 precursor and mature forms in inactive fragments. 14 In addition, granzyme B from cytotoxic cells, chymase from mast cells or meprin \u03b2 from intestinal and kidney epithelial cells can cleave IL-18 precursor in biologically active forms. [15] [16] [17] IL-18 can also be released in its precursor form from dying cells and processed extracellularly in an active form by neutrophil proteases such as proteinase 3. 18 ",

Although nearly all cells express the IL-1R1, not all cells express IL-1RAcP. 21 Similarly, most cells express the IL-18R\u03b1 but not all cells express the IL-18R\u03b2. IL-18R\u03b2 is expressed on T-cells and dendritic cells but not commonly expressed in mesenchymal cells. Following the formation of the heterodimer, the Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains approximate and it appears that the cascade of sequential recruitment of MyD88, the four IRAKs and TRAF-6 followed by the degradation of I\u03baB and release of NF\u03baB are nearly identical as that for IL-1. 21 However, there are differences between IL-1 and IL-18 signaling. With few exceptions, IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 are active on cells in the low nanogram/mL range and often in the picogram/mL range. In contrast, IL-18 activation of cells expressing the two IL-18 receptor chains requires 10 to 20 ng/mL and sometime higher levels. 22 In addition to NF-kB, the IL-18/IL-18R\u03b1/IL-18R\u03b2 complex has been shown to induce phosphorylation of STAT3 in an NK and hippocampal cell lines and the p38 MAP kinase pathway in neutrophils.

Activation of dendritic cells (DC) or macrophages may induce IL-18 precursor transcription, but IL-18 precursor is also constitutively present in the cells. Upon activation of NLRP3, pro-IL-18 is processed by caspase 1 and released in its 18 kDamature form. In association with IL-12 or IL-15 which increase IL-18R\u03b2 expression on T cells, IL-18 induces IFN\u03b3 production by CD4 T cells. IFN\u03b3 in turn, activates macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines. IL-18 can also activate macrophages directly to induce chemokine secretion and NK cells to induce IFN\u03b3 secretion or to stimulate perforin-and FasL-mediated cytotoxicity. In macrophages, the interaction of FasL with Fas induces IL-18 processing by caspase 8. Alternatively, in the absence of IL-12 or IL-15, IL-18 activates Th2 CD4 lymphocytes to produce IL-13 and IL-4 IL-18 induces ICAM-1 expression on myeloid cells, and also VCAM-1 expression on micro-endothelial cells or synovial fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo via NF-kB activation. 45, 46 Blocking IL-18 activity reduces metastasis in a mouse model of melanoma due to a reduction in IL-18induced expression of VCAM-1. 47 IL-18 also induces CXC chemokines by macrophages or synovial fibroblasts as well as angiogenic factors in rheumatoid arthritis tissues. [48] [49] [50] A unique property of IL-18 is the induction of Fas ligand (FasL), which may account for severe hepatic damages in several pathogenic conditions. 12, 51 The induction of fever, a well-studied property of IL-1\u03b2 is not a property of IL-18 since injection of IL-18 into mice, rabbits or humans does not produce fever. 52",

NLRP3, caspase 1 and IL-1\u03b2 play an important role in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis since IL-1\u03b2 mediates obesity-induced inflammation, increases insulin resistance and destroys \u03b2-cells. 95 Thus high IL-18 levels in obese patients, metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes is not unexpected. [96] [97] [98] In addition, a polymorphism of IL-18 gene associated with increased serum IL-18 levels has been linked to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. 99 The visceral rather than subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese individuals produces more IL-18 than lean controls, and serum IL-18 concentrations decreased after bariatric surgery.

            "text": "was not made. In a previous study of Secondary HLH complicating lymphoma, infections and AOSD, we observed an increase in free IL-18, IL-18BP concentrations being similar to those in control patients without HLH, perhaps suggesting a relative resistance of IL-18BP synthesis to IFN\u03b3 which was elevated in these patients. 56 trations. 198 Noteworthy is the fact that in this animal model, no anticytokine strategy has been shown to increase survival probably due to the fact that concentrations of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 are found, respectively, 10-fold and 5-fold higher than in the LCMV-infected perforin-deficient model. 184, 186, 199 However even in the perforin KO-LCMV model, anti-IL-18 treatment did not significantly influence animal survival. 184 Despite disappointing animal data, the role of IL-18 in HLH is valide. In 2014, two independent groups reported on two pediatric patients with severe refractory HLH and digestive tract lesions without mutations affecting cytotoxicity, but bearing gain-of-function mutations of the NLRC4 inflammasome. 66, 200 Ex vivo experiments showed that these mutations induced very high concentrations of IL-18 (10 ng/mL), whereas IL-1\u03b2 was modestly affected. 204 An unusually frequent complication of sJIA is macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a form of secondary HLH, which occurs in 15% of the patients, whereas hemophagocytosis (\"occult MAS\") may be present in the bone marrow of almost 50% of the patients with active sJIA, suggesting a special pathogenic link between these 2 diseases. 205 Initial gene expression profile study discovered an IL-1 signature in sJIA, and other studies have found upregulation of a cluster of genes involved in innate immunity and IL-1R/TLR signaling. 206, 207 Nevertheless, treatments with anakinra (IL-1 Receptor antagonist) or canakinumab (anti-IL-1\u03b2 monoclonal antibody) are effective in nearly 50% of the patients. Another group of patients, however, with a greater number of involved joints and lower neutrophil count may not or incompletely respond to anakinra, developing persistent synovitis. 208 It is also possible to distinguish two different subgroups of sJIA patients depending on their serum cytokine profile, the group with more severe arthritis having higher concentrations of IL-6. 209 Indeed IL-6 is markedly elevated in sJIA patients and correlates with the severity of joint involvement. 210 Inhibition of IL-6 using the IL-6 receptor blocking antibody tocilizumab may be an effective treatment in sJIA patients not responding to IL-1\u03b2 blockade. 211 IL-18 has been found highly elevated in the serum of active sJIA in numerous studies. 212 220 The authors considered IFN\u03b3-mediated inhibition of Th17 as a possible explanation of this protective effect. It should be noted that IL-17 has been found elevated in sJIA patients, due to increased IL-17 positive \u03b3\u03b4 cells expressing IL-18R\u03b1 whose proliferation is dependent on IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. 42 Another explanation may be the long-term recognized negative effect of IFN\u03b3 on IL-1\u03b2 production. 214 In addition, the links of MAS with primary HLH leads to the search for a common pathogenic pathway. NK cell cytotoxicity was reported to be abnormal in patients with active sJIA with or without MAS, consisting in decreased circulating NK numbers, perforin expression and cytotoxicity.

Present in the serum of healthy humans at a 20-fold molar excess compared to IL-18, IL-18BP may contribute to a default mechanism by which a Th1 response to foreign organisms is blunted in order to reduce triggering an autoimmune responses to a routine infection.55 Although IL-18BP is readily secreted, it falls into the functional category of being a shed soluble receptor. As shown inFigure1, IL-18BP contains only one IgG domain whereas the Type II IL-1 receptor contains three domains. In this regard, the single IgG domain of IL-18BP is similar to IL-1R8 (SIGIRR), which also has a single IgG domain. The salient property of IL-18BP in immune responses is in downregulating Th1 responses by binding to IL-18 and thus reducing the induction of IFN\u03b3. Since IL-18 also affects Th2 responses, IL-18BP also has properties controlling a Th2 cytokine response. Harboring a classic signal peptide, IL-18BP is readily secreted. Serum levels in healthy subjects are in the range of 2,000-4,000 pg/mL compared to the levels of IL-18 in the same sera of 80-120 pg/mL. 55 Moreover, IL-18BP binds IL-18 with an affinity of 400 pM, an affinity significantly higher than that of IL-18Ra. Because a single IL-18BP molecule binds a single IL-18 molecule, one can calculate bound vs free IL-18 in a mixture of both molecules. 55 This balance and the concentrations of free IL-18 may be more relevant than total IL-18 when interpreting the concentrations of IL-18 in patients. For esample, in Wegener's granulomatosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, both IL-18BP and IL-18 are high, but the level of IL-18BP",

In this way, IL-18 maintains a normal microbiota in the digestive tract.

In summary, IL-18 aggravates atherosclerosis by inducing IFN\u03b3, which promotes the acceleration of the vascular disease.116 Despite these pro-atherogenic properties, IL-18 gave controversial results when used as a biomarker in cardiovascular diseases. Several studies suggest that IL-18 is increased (in the order 70 to 300 pg/mL) in the serum of patients with coronary diseases, with a predictive value for death occurrence and a good correlation with coronary atherosclerosis evaluated by coronarography, but these results were not confirmed when carotid atheroma was evaluated by ultrasound.97,[117][118][119][120] IL-18 is, however, increased in patients at risk or with myocardial infarction as well as in patients with congestive heart failure.121-124 Increased serum IL-18 concentrations and tissue IL-18 expression were found in a murine model of acute myocardial infarction and IV injection of both anti-IL-18 or mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing IL-18BP into the coronary artery before ischemia, reduced infarct size. 125-127 IL-18 may be involved in several aspects of myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure. Stimulation of a cardiomyocyte cell line with IL-18 induces cell hypertrophy and production of atrial natriuretic peptide, a marker of cardiac hypertrophy. 128 Injection of IL-18 to WT mice induces atrial natriuretic peptide expression in the heart, as well as myocardial hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction. 129 IL-18 has cardiodepressant effects and neutralization of IL-18 with either anti-IL-18 monoclonal antibodies or IL-18BP improved contractile function. 129,130 Importantly, IL-18 may mediate some of the well-known cardiodepressant effects of IL-1\u03b2, since IL-18 blockade with IL-18BP has been shown to prevent the systolic dysfunction induced by IL-1\u03b2. 131 Finally, IL-18 participates in extracellular remodeling and myocardial fibrosis.

However, IL-18BP injection 8 hours after sepsis onset appeared slightly protective in the more severe forms, but not in those with a low predicted mortality rate.174 Similar to what is observed in influenza, in the LPS-induced model of sepsis, there is a duality role for IL-18. Injection of low doses LPS seems to induce moderate and transient serum increase of IL-18 and IFN\u03b3, which enhanced antibacterial host defenses and are protective.In contrast, after the administration of high doses of LPS, high concentrations of IL-18 and IFN\u03b3 are observed, which increased until death, associated with reduced antibacterial defenses. In the latter case, anti-IL-18 restores antibacterial defenses and is protective of a fatal outcome, whereas it decreased defenses in the former situation, suggesting an optimal range of IL-18 concentration is essential for host defenses.175 These data may be in part explained by a positive loop of induction of caspase 1 mRNA transcription by IFN\u03b3, leading to sustained IL-18 and IFN\u03b3 levels.176 More recently, the role of IL-18 and its capacity to induce IL-17 in conjunction with IL-correlation with the gestational age. In a lethal model of neonatal sepsis, IL-18-deficient mice were protected whereas the administration of IL-18 increased lethality. In this model, ablation of the adaptive immune system afforded no protection, whereas treatment with anti-IL-17 was protective, due to the fact that IL-18 induced IL-17 secretion by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from injured digestive tract or the lungs.Interestingly, in this model IL-1R1-but not IL-1\u03b2-deficient mice were protected, suggesting a role for IL-1\u03b1 which was found highly expressed in the gut of septic neonatal mice treated with IL-18. IL-17 is known to play a role in neutrophil-induced inflammation and IL-18 is known to increase PMN functions.25,177 Thus, despite a protective role of IL-18 and IL-17 in host defense against infection, their combined excessive actions during sepsis may become deleterious. The duality of IL-18 in sepsis and possibly in other models of cytokine storm might be explained by different inflammasome and caspase involvement. Caspase 1-deficient mice which are resistant to endotoxic shock, are in fact deficient in both caspase 1 and caspase 11. 11",

IL-18 is present in the bone marrow of patients with active sJIA, suggesting that the underlying proliferation of hemophagocytic M2 is part of sJIA and possibly linked to increased IL-18concentrations.222",

Possibly, via IL-13 and IgE production, it may have a role in the immune response against helminths. In some inflammatory diseases, it remains unclear whether IL-18 or IFN\u03b3 is causative. Unusually high serum concentrations of free IL-18 (more than 10 ng/mL) such as NLRC4 mutations or systemic JIA/ AOSD implicate a dominant role for IL-18. Treatment with recombinant IL-18BP or anti-IL-18 is likely to be effective in the treatment of HLH syndrome associated with both of these diseases. In other diseases, such as avian flu, corticosteroid-resistant asthma, sepsis or other secondary HLH, an INF\u03b3-biased cytokine storm is found, an imbalance between IL-18 and IL-18BP has been described, and the concentrations of free IL-18 are in the nanogram range. In these diseases, the role of pyroptosis, the levels and the role of IL-37 should probably be studied in the future, and IL-18-targeted therapy possibly considered. In addition, as shown in the heart, some of the pathogenic effects of IL-1\u03b2 are mediated by IL-18, suggesting that IL-18 could be a target for therapy for heart diseases besides IL-1 and NLRP3. The presence of IL-18 in mesenchymal cells, notably keratinocytes and epithelial cells suggest an important role for IL-18 in local barrier defenses which in some chronic inflammatory diseases may be disrupted.",

This property of IL-18 is due to its ability to induce IFN\u03b3 either with IL-12 or IL-15, since IL-12 or IL-15 increases the expression of IL-18R\u03b1. IL-18 in combination with IL-12 acts on CD4, CD8 T cells and NK cells to induce IFN\u03b3 production, via the simultaneous activation of NF-kB by IL-18 and STAT-4 by IL-12. 5 Interestingly, most of the effects of IL-12 concerning IFN\u03b3 induction by T cells, appears dependent on caspase 1 and are therefore mediated via IL-18 processing. 33 IL-18 also directly upregulates",

That report demonstrates that IL-18 inhibition is likely an effective strategy in HLH, at least in this particular genetic sJIA (and its adult homolog AOSD) constitutes a distinct group of patients among JIA.203 Systemic JIA is clinically characterized by high spiking fever, cutaneous rash, hepato/splenomegaly, serositis, whereas arthritis the main symptom in JIA, could be absent at least at the disease onset.

Elevated IL-18 concentrations correlate with ferritin concentrations and the occurrence of MAS, with a cut-off of 47 ng/mL predictive of MAS occurence.209,213,215 All but one of these reports studied total IL-18, however, using a new ELISA able to directly detect free IL-18, elevation of free IL-18 was recently confirmed in the serum of sJIA patients.216 IL-18BP concentrations are increased in sJIA patients compared to healthy controls, but not differently than patients with other auto-immune diseases, thus out of proportion of IL-18 increase. The reason for this imbalance may involve epigenetic regulation. miRNA134 which inhibits IL-18BP synthesis is overexpressed in the PBMC of AOSD patients and miRNA134 concentrations are elevated in the serum of patients with active disease. 217 Correcting IL-18/IL-18BP imbalance is a rationale strategy, and an open-label phase 2 trial using IL-18BP has recently been conducted. AOSD patients were treated and normalization of both CRP and ferritin levels were observed with a dose of 160 mg subcutaneously three times a week (Gabay C, personal communication 2017). Despite high concentrations of IL-18, IFN\u03b3 is rarely found in patients with active JIA and numerous studies of gene expression failed to detect an IFN\u03b3-signature in these patients. 207,216,218,219 Moreover, in a recently described animal model of sJIA using complete Freund's adjuvant, IFN\u03b3 appeared rather protective, since IFN\u03b3-deficient mice developed a more severe phenotype which was dependent on IL-17.",

Two reports demonstrated that in sJIA patients NK cells are resistant to the action of IL-18, due to an absence of phosphorylation of IL-18R\u03b2, rendering NK cells incapable to produce IFN\u03b3 in response to IL-18. 228,229 Moreover, some reports have suggested that high IL-18 concentrations may induce lymphocyte apoptosis and NK cell death possibly explaining the observed NK lymphopenia. 230,231",
