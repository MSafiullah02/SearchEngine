Despite these efforts, studies have consistently found that US households are not ready for emergencies, there have been no significant improvements in preparedness, and the proportion of people fulfilling some actions, such as having a communication plan, has decreased.5,6 Even when individuals claim to be prepared, often they are not. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly 50% of US households do not have resources or plans in the event of emergency.7 In a separate study, the Federal Emergency Management Agency found that 70% of survey respondents completed at least 1 mitigation action but only 25% of respondents completed 2 mitigation actions. Although individuals may consider preparedness actions, their actions may be insufficient.6",

            "text": "In this study, we used a nationally representative sample from the 2017 American Housing Survey to identify factors associated with household emergency preparedness and whether they differ by type of preparedness. We differentiated resource- vs action-based preparedness. Resource-based items are material or financial resources, such as food and water stockpiles, an electric generator, or having financial resources for evacuation. Action-based preparedness items are activities that enhance households\u2019 preparedness through coordination actions, such as having an alternative communication plan or meeting location. These items do not rely on material resources and thus are less likely to have economic limitations for fulfillment. Previous studies have identified factors associated with some preparedness actions; however, to our knowledge, no study has analyzed extensively their associations with different levels and types of disaster preparedness.5,9,10,11,16,18,20,21,22,23 Taking this granular approach to examining preparedness is important because the relative importance of items may vary across disasters. For example, having emergency preparedness kits, financial resources, food stockpiles, and communication plans are important for responding to the novel coronavirus pandemic owing to temporary shelter in place restrictions and associated economic loss, whereas water stockpiles, electronic generators, an alternative meeting point, and a vehicle available for evacuation are relevant to responding to a natural disaster.",

Households were classified as prepared if they fulfilled at least half of the items. We selected that cutoff because it was a midpoint to distinguish levels of preparedness, having all regressions in the same logistic format allows for an easier interpretation, and sensitivity analyses using ordinary least squares on a continuous 0 to 9 outcome and a multinomial logit for low, medium, and high levels of preparedness yielded similar findings (eTable 3 in the Supplement). We did not weight preparedness items differently in our indices because their comparative importance and effectiveness has not been demonstrated.20,27",

            "text": "Table 3 and Table 4 present the adjusted models for the adjusted odds of fulfilling specific resource- and action-based preparedness items. Many findings are consistent with the results from the aggregate preparedness measures in Table 2. For example, woman-headed households had lower preparedness on half of individual resource-based items, including having an electric generator (aOR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.82-0.97]), a carry-on emergency kit (aOR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.82-0.94]), and financial resources for evacuation (aOR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.66-0.80]). Married household heads were more likely to fulfill each resource-based item (food stockpile: aOR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.09-1.31]; water stockpile: aOR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.18-1.37]; electric generator: aOR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.69-2.08]; carry-on emergency kit: aOR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.12-1.29]; financial resources for evacuation: aOR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.55-1.88]; evacuation vehicle: aOR, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.70-2.46]) and action-based item (communication plan: aOR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.04-1.23]; meeting location: aOR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.11-1.30; plan with financial information: aOR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.15-1.38]). However, there were differences in the associations between household demographic characteristics and the likelihood of fulfilling items reflecting financial security more generally (eg, financial resources for an evacuation) or was exclusive to emergencies. Households with heads who were black were more likely to fulfill specific resource- and action-based items that were related to emergencies but did not require substantial resources (water stockpile: aOR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.07-1.31]; carry-on emergency kit: aOR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.14-1.39]; alternative communication plan: aOR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.39-1.72]; alternative meeting location: aOR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.07-1.31]) but less likely to fulfill items requiring large investments or financial stability (food stockpile: aOR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.66-0.86]; electric generator: aOR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.49-0.67]; financial resources for evacuation: aOR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.48-0.61]; evacuation vehicle: aOR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.33-0.50]). Households whose heads were Hispanic/Latino had a similar pattern of lower preparedness on specific items requiring substantial resources (food stockpile: aOR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.61-0.76]; electric generator: aOR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.56-0.74]; financial resources: aOR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.59-0.74]; evacuation vehicle: aOR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.46-0.70]), but they were more likely to have a water stockpile (aOR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.31-1.59]) and alternative communication plan (aOR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.24]). Households with higher incomes were more likely to fulfill preparedness items requiring resources and reflecting financial stability (food stockpile: aOR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.14]; electric generator: aOR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.13-1.25]; financial resources for evacuation: aOR, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.92-2.13]; evacuation vehicle: aOR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.34-1.55]; plan with financial information: aOR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.16-1.27]), but they were less likely to have an alternative communication plan (aOR, 0.89 ([95% CI, 0.86-0.93]) or alternative meeting location (aOR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.99]). Households whose heads had higher levels of education had increased odds of having financial resources for evacuation (high school diploma: aOR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.43-1.88]; some college: aOR, 2.56 [95% CI, 2.24-2.93); some graduate education: aOR, 7.04 [95% CI, 5.51-8.99]), an evacuation vehicle (high school diploma: aOR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.31-2.11]; some college: aOR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.61-2.56]; some graduate education: aOR, 2.34 [95% CI, 1.61-3.40]), and a financial plan (high school diploma: aOR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.31-1.72]; some college: aOR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.59-2.06]; some graduate education: aOR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.50-2.12]), but increasing levels of education were associated with decreasing odds of having a water stockpile (high school diploma: aOR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78-0.99]; some college: aOR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.71-0.90]; some graduate education: aOR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.55-0.74]).",

First, conducting a causal or longitudinal analysis was not possible because the data are cross-sectional and the disaster preparedness module changes across the American Household Survey\u2019s data collection cycles. Second, our study sample only includes households that responded to all disaster preparedness questions in the survey. The study sample may be biased toward individuals who are more aware of preparedness actions, thereby overestimating the proportion of US residents who fulfill preparedness items. When we compared the study sample with all survey respondents, respondents who completed all emergency preparedness questions and were thus included in our study were wealthier and more likely to be married and have children. Our population estimates of the proportion of US households that are prepared are likely an overestimate, and it is more appropriate to focus on the adjusted models comparing the household-level predictors of preparedness rather than on absolute levels of preparedness. Additionally, further qualitative research is needed to understand the rationale behind fulfilling each preparedness item or why individuals appear to perceive them differently.",
