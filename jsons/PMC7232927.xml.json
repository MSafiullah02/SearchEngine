The components may be interspersed in any way that facilitates the BCBA\u2019s ability to complete the assessment.

While running these programs, the BCBA records clinical impressions across the following fields: the number of redirections needed for the client to attend to the screen/BCBA, the number of minutes and trials to which the client attends, the least intrusive successful prompts, and the schedule of reinforcement required to maintain correct responding.

The client demonstrates the ability to self-manage a reinforcement system or to tolerate delayed reinforcement, or the client responds consistently to a reinforcement schedule delivered by the caregiver. In some instances, the repertoire presented by the learner may include an advanced skill set (e.g., a client being treated primarily for impacted social skills).

For example, teaching the client to travel to the caregiver to recruit reinforcement once earned may improve the client\u2019s likelihood of obtaining reinforcement under generalized contingencies. Such programming could also provide a benefit to the caregiver, who may need to attend to other priorities that conflict with fully facilitating sessions.

In other cases, the caregiver and clinical team may be well aligned, but the caregiver requires more advanced training and coaching (e.g., implementation of behavior management strategies or specific prompting and fading strategies).

            "text": "A second potential limitation relates to the very use of telehealth for the delivery of direct ABA services. Multiple studies, such as those summarized by Healy and Lydon (2013), support that a robust intensity of direct service (typically falling between 20 and 40 hours per week) is associated with optimal outcomes in behavior-analytic treatment. Although caregiver consultation is a valuable element to incorporate into behavior-analytic programs, the literature does not suggest that a caregiver-led model would outperform a model implemented directly by a professional trained extensively in ABA. A potential limitation of telehealth services in general, particularly in models indicating caregiver facilitation, is that the intensity of services may be particularly limited based on caregiver availability. This is problematic, in that the outcome literature does not suggest that some small amount of treatment is better than nothing. Therefore, care should be taken to maintain an intensity of services that reflects best practice literature and is matched to the individual needs of the client, even while pursuing a telehealth model. This is why it is so critical to move clients toward a model that lessens reliance on caregiver facilitation (i.e., through less intrusive prompting and thinned schedules of reinforcement). Although this potential limitation is a grave concern, if in-person services are not possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems plausible that delivery of telehealth services is likely to produce some benefits to the client over no services at all.",

These same factors may limit a caregiver\u2019s availability to facilitate as well, especially amid a crisis that has led to some caregivers managing multiple contingencies\u2014as caregiver, employee, homeschooler, and more. However, it may be the case that implementing telehealth services in appropriate instances will allow for the allocation of resources to the smaller subset of clients for whom in-person service delivery is essential to maintain their safety (e.g., reducing the number of clients being seen in a clinic, or reducing the number of clients and homes with which a BT comes in contact).",

When all social functioning has returned to normal\u2014or the new picture of normal\u2014there will still be clients to serve who do not have access to consistent, in-person ABA services.

Immediately, clients will continue to access services, and countless jobs will be saved during the greatest crisis of a generation.
