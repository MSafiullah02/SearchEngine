Recently, Neil1 ( 14) has determined the virions are 35-40 nm in diameter and consist of a sin-nucleotide sequence of the central region of the FCV gle major capsid protein of 60-70 kDa ( 1) .

Although the ily Caliciviridae because of, in addition to their distinct data were not published, Neil1 ( 14) also mentioned the morphology of the virion (3, 4) and possession of a existence of another large ORF in the 3'-terminal 2400 single capsid protein (5-7), the presence of a subge-bases of the genomic RNA, which was entirely ennomic RNA found in calicivirus-infected cells (8, 9) . coded by 2.4-kb subgenomic RNA. Relatively few studies with regard to the molecular biology of the caliciviruses have been carried out. Neil1 and Mengeling ( 10) first cloned cDNAs from the CFI strain of FCV, which was isolated in the U.S. ( 1 I) , and analyzed the FCV-specific RNAs formed in the virus-infected cells using the cDNAs as probes. They indicated that an 8.2-kb genomic RNA and three subgenomic RNAs of 4.8, 4.2, and 2.4 kb synthesized in the cells were nested, coterminal transcripts with common 3'-ends. Carter (12) reported the sequence of the 3'-terminal 505 nucleotides (nt) of FCV RNA using the F9 vaccine strain whose origin was the U.S. ( 13). The cDNA was used as a probe in Northern blot analyses to Previously, we have identified seven neutralizing epitopes of the F4 strain of FCV, the prototype strain of FCV in Japan, with the aid of an extensive panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and neutralizationresistant variants ( 15, 16) . Four of the seven epitopes were shown to exist on the capsid protein of the virus by immunoblot analysis ( 76). To further understand the antigenic structure of FCV, it is important to analyze the nucleotide sequence of the gene for the capsid protein. In this paper we report the molecular cloning and the sequence analysis of a cloned cDNA representing the 3'-end of FCV F4 RNA. Within the sequence of the 3'-terminal 3516 nt we found three ORFs. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two ORFs at the extreme 3'-end and in the 5'-flanking region of the cDNA were compared with those of other FCV strains reported previously by Carter ( 12) and Neil1 ( 14) . The other ORF which located between the two ORFs was suggested to encode the capsid precursor protein having significant amino acid sequence homology with the VP3 of picornaviruses.",

This molecular weight is similar to that of the 76-kDa capsid precursor protein of FCV estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyactylamide gel electrophoresis (24). From these observations, it is strongly suggested that this ORF encodes the capsid precursor protein of FCV F4. Preliminary experiments indicated that the capsid protein was blocked to Edoman degradation. The presence of a blocked amino terminus was also indicated in attempts to dansylate the amino terminus of the capsid protein of VESV (25). Further studies will be necessary to identify the cleavage site of the capsid precursor protein.",

The amino acid sequences of the VP3 of poliovirus Sabin 1 and foot and mouth disease virus Al 2, and an analogous region of FCV (an underlined sequence in Fig. 1 ) were aligned essentially according to the alignments for picornaviral capsid proteins described by Palmenberg (26) (Fig. 4) . Homology observed between FCV and two representative picornaviruses suggested that these proteins have similar function(s) and have been diverged from a common ancestral protein. Similarities observed not only in nonstructural proteins between FCV and picornaviruses ( 14), but also in a structural protein between these viruses support the grouping of caliciviruses into the superfamily II, picornavirus-like families (27).",

However, the junction sequences between the three ORFs of FCV were short (5 nt, nucleotide positions 1 144 to 1 148 in Fig. 1 ) or absent (1 nt overlapped, nucleotide position 3152 in Fig. 1 ). The junction sequences in the genomes of the coronaviruses and the alphaviruses are regarded to be of importance in transcriptions of their mRNAs (27, 29) .
