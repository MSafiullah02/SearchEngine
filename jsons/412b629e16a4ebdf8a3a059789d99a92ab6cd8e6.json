Chapter 7 will review several other methodological steps in appraising research (sampling, defining the treatment or other intervention, test and measures, and statistics).

            "text": "This review of research designs has three main purposes. First, it will introduce the variety of terminology used in EBP research, which is often drawn from medical research. This terminology sometimes differs from the terminology used in most social work research texts that draw on social sciences research terminology. Second, the strengths and limitations of each research design are examined and compared. Third, the research designs are rank ordered from \"strongest\" to \"weakest\" following the EBM/EBP research hierarchy. This allows readers to quickly understand why some research designs are favored in the EBM/EBP literature. Thyer (2011) states, quite accurately, that the EBP practice decision-making process does not include any hierarchy of research designs. This is indeed correct. The EBP practice decision-making process states that clinicians should use the \"best available evidence.\" It does not state that only the results of research with certain types of research designs are to be valued. That is, it is entirely appropriate to use the results of case study research or even \"practice wisdom\" when no better evidence is available. Yet many organizations and institutions make quite explicit that there is a de facto hierarchy of evidence within EBP. This hierarchy is even clearly stated in the early writing of Dr. Archie Cochrane (1972) , who promoted the use of experimental research knowledge to inform contemporary practice decisionmaking. Littell (2011) notes that the Cochrane Collaboration publishes \"empty reviews\" that report no research results deemed to be of sufficient design quality to guide practice decision-making. This practice contradicts the idea of identifying the best available evidence. In effect, the best available evidence is reduced to evidence generated by experimental research designs. This practice creates confusion about what constitutes the best available evidence for clinicians, policy planners, and researchers.",

They make this choice because only well-designed experiments allow attribution of causal relationships to say that an intervention caused observed changes with minimal error. Still, this practice represents some academic and economic politics within EBP research summaries. As discussed in Chap. 2, there are good arguments for and against this position, but it is not entirely consistent with the stated EBM/ EBP practice decision-making model. Clinical social workers should be aware that this difference in viewpoints about the importance of research design quality is not always clearly stated in the EBP literature.

Some seek to explore and clarify new disorders or concerns and to illustrate innovative practices. Others seek to describe the characteristics of client populations. Some track changes in clients over time. Still others seek to determine if a specific intervention caused a specific change. While we agree that the EBP practice decision-making process states that clinicians should use \"the best available evidence\" and not solely evidence derived from experimental results, we will present research designs in a widely used hierarchy drawn from the Oxford University's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (2009 , 2016 . This hierarchy does very clearly give greater weight to experimental, randomized controlled trial [RCT] research results. It should be seen as representing a specific point of view, applied for specific purposes. At the same time, such research designs do provide a strong basis for arguing that a treatment caused any changes found, so long as the measures are appropriate, valid, and reliable and the sample tested is of adequate size and variety. Due to the strong interval validity offered by experimental research designs, results based on RCTs design are often privileged in EBM/EBP reports. We will begin this listing with the experimental research designs that allow causal attribution. We will then progress from experiments to quasi-experiments, then move to observational or descriptive research, and end with case studies. The organization of this section follows the format of the research evidence hierarchy created by Oxford University's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (2009 , 2100 2016 , 2018 .",

Since researchers create the two groups by random assignment to generate two very similar groups, the RCT is sometimes called a parallel group design. Usually one group is treated and the other is used as an untreated control group. Researchers sometimes use placebo interventions with the control group. However, researchers may alternately design experiments comparing two or more different treatments where one has been previously demonstrated to produce significantly better results than does an untreated control group. Pre-to postcomparisons demonstrate the changes for each group. Comparison of post-scores across the treated groups allows for demonstration of any greater improvement due to the treatment.

However, if the washout period is not sufficient, there may be carry-over effects from the initial treatment that in turn undermines the validity of the second comparison. Used with medications, there are often lab tests that allow determination of effective washout periods. Secondary effects, such as learning or behavior changes that occur during the initial treatment, may not wash out.

More than one measure may be used in the same quasi-experiment. Note carefully that the key difference from a true experiment is the lack of random assignment of participants. The lack of random assignment in a quasi-experiment introduces some threats to the internal validity of the study. That is, it may introduce unknown differences across the groups that ultimately affect study outcomes. The purpose of random assignment is to distribute unknown variables or influences to each groups as equally as possible. Without random assignment, the studied groups may have important differences that are not equally distributed across the groups. Say, for example, that positive social supports interact with a treatment to enhance its outcome. Without random assignment, the treated group might be biased in that it includes more people with strong social supports than does the control group. The interaction of the treatment with the impact of social supports might make the results appear better than they might have been if random assignment was used. Thus in some EBM/EBP hierarchies of research evidence, quasi-experimental study results are rated as \"weaker\" than are results of true experiments or RCTs. That said, they are still useful sources of knowledge and are often the best available research evidence for some treatments and service programs. To reduce potential assignment bias, quasi-experimental studies use \"matching\" in which as many characteristics of participants in each group are matched as closely as possible. Of course, matching is only possible where the variables are fully known at the start of the study.",

The EBM/EBP research design hierarchy places great emphasis on research designs that can document that a specific treatment caused the changes found after treatment. This is an important step in determining the effectiveness or efficacy of a treatment. Many documents portray experiments, or RCTs, as the best form of evidence upon which to base practice decisions. Critical consumers of research should pay close attention to the kind of research designs used in the studies they examine for practice application.",

That is, where little or no experimental or RCT research is available, the research summary may indicate there is inadequate research knowledge to point to effective treatments. \"Empty\" summaries pointing to no high-quality research evidence on some disorders are found in the Cochrane Review database. This reflects their high standards and careful review. It also fails to state just what constitutes the best available evidence. Empty reviews do not aid clinicians and clients in practice decision-making. They simply indicate that clinicians should undertake an article-by-article review of research evidence on their clinical topic. Clinicians must bear in mind that the EBP practice decision-making process promotes the use of \"the best available evidence.\" If such evidence is not based on experimental research, it should still be used, but used with caution. It is entirely appropriate in the EBP framework to look for descriptive or case study research when there is no experimental evidence available on a specific disorder or concern.",

            "text": "Even when experimental or RCT research designs set the framework for establishing cause and effect relationships, a number of related methodological choices also are important to making valid knowledge claims. These include the quality of sampling, the inclusion of diverse participants in the sample, the quality of the outcome measures used, the definitions of the treatments, and the careful use of the correct statistical tests. Adequate sample size and representativeness are important to generalizing study results to other similar people and settings. Appropriately conceptualized, valid, reliable, and sensitive outcome measures document any changes. How treatments are defined and delivered will have a major impact on the merit and worth of study results. Statistics serve as a decision-making tool to determine if the results are unlikely to have happened by chance alone. All these methods work in Summary tandem to yield valid and rigorous results. These issues will be explored in the next two chapters on Step 3 of the EBP process, further appraising some additional methodological issues in practice research.",
