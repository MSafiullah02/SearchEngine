Sixteen high-touch surfaces were evaluated (Table 2): 14 in the patients' room (bedrails, mechanical ventilator, ventilator tubing, sink, garbage bin, monitor, intravenous poles, intravenous pumps, telephone, door knobs, floor, drapes-blinds, air conditioning vent, and shelf of the surgical boom) and 2 outside (computer and medical chart). Environmental samples were collected as described by Julian et al.5 Briefly, a sterile swab premoistened with viral transport media was used to swab each surface (at least 10 cm2) horizontally, vertically, and diagonally for 30 seconds. This procedure was repeated using eluents: 1/4 lactated ringer solution and phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Virus detection was performed using specific real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the upstream of the envelope gene and the open reading frame 1A. Positive tests were reported as the cycle threshold value for both upstream of the envelope gene (E) and open reading (O) frame 1A.",

It was postulated from the outbreak in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in May-June 2012 that respiratory droplet and airborne transmission during aerosol-generating procedures were the most likely transmission modes.6 However, genetic data from a cluster in Hafr Al-Batin, Saudi Arabia, showed that direct person-to-person contact could not account for all of their cases,7 therefore raising the likelihood of an alternate transmission mechanism. Studies on kinetics and patterns of viral excretion indicate that MERS-CoV RNA was isolated from urine and feces 13 and 16 days, respectively, after initial symptoms.8 Viral shedding from respiratory aspirates may persist up to 33 days after illness onset.9 Prolonged viral shedding8, 9 and survival on surfaces for 48 hours3 make it difficult to ignore contaminated environmental surfaces as a potential etiology of hospital outbreaks.",

However, we did screening at the tail-end of our outbreak when the patients' viral load might have been low and our infection control practices might have been optimal. Additionally, MERS patients were managed in our ICU since 2013 and were usually cohorted in 1 unit where the staff became very meticulous about PPE use and environmental cleaning. Moreover, fairly weak disinfectants, such as povidone iodine, have a rapid virucidal activity (reduction in virus titer by \u22654 log10) against MERS-CoV, with an exposure time of just 15 seconds.10 Further, Leclercq et al demonstrated that at relatively low temperatures of 56\u00b0C, only 25 minutes was needed to reduce the initial titer by 4 log10, while at 65\u00b0C virucidy dropped significantly to 1 minute.11 This sensitivity to weak disinfectants could explain why our stringent environmental cleaning policies may have attenuated the recovery of viral genetic material on fomites within the patients' rooms.",
