Even though it fails to exhibit any of the standard symmetries known to protect the Haldane phase it still displays all characteristics of this phase: Fractionalized spin-1 2 boundary spins, non-trivial string order and -when using an appropriate definition -a two-fold degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum. We trace these properties back to the existence of an SOq(3) quantum group symmetry and speculate about potential links to discrete duality symmetries. We expect our findings and methods to be relevant for the identification, characterization and classification of other symmetry-protected topological phases with non-standard symmetries.",

It exhibits a unique ground state, an excitation gap, a two-fold degeneracy in the bipartite entanglement spectrum and, at least when SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry is preserved, fractional boundary spins as well as non-trivial string order. While these facts have only been verified numerically for the spin-1 Heisenberg model, the associated AKLT model [4, 5] provides an alternative representative of the same phase in which all these properties can be established with full analytical rigor and where the existence of non-trivial string order can be linked to the breaking of a hidden Z 2 \u00d7 Z 2 symmetry [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . This is due to the fact that the ground state of the AKLT Hamiltonian has a simple representation as a matrix product state (MPS) [4, 5, 9, 10] . (See also Refs. [11-13] for a general discussion of MPS and finitely correlated states.)",

As we will discuss, this is (pre-sumably) related to the extensive breaking of standard group symmetries and, in addition, to the puzzling lack of degeneracies in its entanglement spectrum [20] that would be expected in the presence of boundary spins and quantum group symmetry. With this Letter we aim to close this gap. We explain why and in which sense the quantum group symmetry U q su(2) is capable of protecting the non-trivial topology of the qAKLT model and we revisit the entanglement calculations, showing that the existing literature has been more concerned about implementing periodic boundary conditions than about actually enforcing the quantum group symmetry. We expect that our findings will trigger a systematic search for other symmetry-protected topological phases with nonstandard symmetries and that our methods will be helpful in identifying, characterizing and classifying them.",

It needs to be emphasized though that this symmetry is only present when the chain is (semi)infinite or considered with open boundary conditions. If periodic boundary conditions are used, as is the case in most of the literature on this subject, the Hamiltonian and also its ground state are not invariant under U q su(2) . This symmetry is only restored if specific twisted boundary conditions are used. These facts are well known in the community working on quantum group invariant integrable models, see e.g. Refs.

This is due to the fact that the representation theory of U q su(2) at real values q = 0 precisely mimics the representation theory of su(2), including labeling and dimensions of irreducible representations and tensor product decompositions [30] . In particular, integer physical spins can only arise from either two integer or two half-integer auxiliary spins. For su(2), all of these representations lift to SU (2) while only integer spin representations lift to SO(3) = SU (2)/Z 2 . In contrast, half-integer spins are only projective representations of SO(3) since they have a non-trivial action of the central subgroup Z 2 \u2282 SU (2).

All finite dimensional representations are fully reducible. The quantum group has irreducible representations V j that are labelled by a spin j = 0, 1 2 , 1, . . . and have dimension 2j + 1. Moreover, the decomposition of a tensor product j 1 \u2297 j 2 precisely corresponds to the well-known decomposition for su(2). In view of the non-trivial (and q-dependent) coproduct, concrete expressions for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are different though.",
