Jiang and colleagues have demonstrated that the heptad repeat 1 and 2 regions in the S2 domain of S protein associate to form a fusion\u2010active oligomeric core structure and a peptide derived from the HR2 region inhibits SARS\u2010CoV infection 12.",

Our previous studies demonstrated that SARS\u2010CoV can be detected in certain cell types, eg pneumocytes, in the lung tissues of SARS patients using different methods, including H&E and Macchiavello's stains for observing inclusion bodies, and transmission electron microscopy for revealing corona\u2010like virus particles 17, 18. In the present study, inclusion bodies and corona\u2010like virus particles were observed in the lung tissues from all of the SARS patients (Figure 2A\u2013C). However, no inclusion bodies or virus particles were identified in the lung tissues of the four control patients. The presence of SARS\u2010CoV in the lung tissues of SARS patients was further confirmed by RT\u2010PCR, since the SARS\u2010CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment and M protein gene were identified in lung tissues from three SARS patients (Figure 2D; samples from the fourth patient were tested later and showed similar results, not included in this figure). However, these SARS\u2010CoV RNA species were not found in lung tissues from the four control patients.

Two representative slides showing pneumocytes positive with the mAb specific for SARS\u2010CoV N protein and with the probes specific for SARS\u2010CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment are shown in Figure 2E and F, respectively. In contrast, none of the cells in the lung tissues of the four control patients were positive in both assays (Figure 2G and H).

Therefore, the development of effective strategies for the protection of at\u2010risk populations is urgently needed. However, the pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV infection and the virus transmission pathways have not been clearly defined. The distribution of SARS\u2010CoV in organs and tissues in SARS patients has not been systematically determined due to the lack of antibodies and probes specific for SARS\u2010CoV. Recently, we developed an IHC assay, using a murine mAb specific for the SARS\u2010CoV N protein, and an ISH method, using probes specific for the SARS\u2010CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for in situ detection of SARS\u2010CoV in tissues.",

Strikingly, SARS\u2010CoV was also detected in many other organs and tissues, including stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal, liver and cerebrum (Figure 3 and Table 1). However, the virus was not detected in oesophagus, thyroid, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, testis, ovary, uterus, heart, aorta, cerebellum or muscle (Table 1). These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal system may also be a primary target of SARS\u2010CoV, ie virus in contaminated food and water may enter the human body through epithelial cells covering the surface of the gastrointestinal tract, although there is no direct evidence to show that food\u2010borne SARS\u2010CoV is transmitted through the gastrointestinal system. Other organs with detectable SARS\u2010CoV may be secondary targets of SARS\u2010CoV, ie the virions in blood that are released from the primary target (eg respiratory system) may infect cells in these organs and tissues. Another possibility is that SARS\u2010CoV may not infect these cells, but rather binds specifically or non\u2010specifically to their surface, resulting in detection of SARS\u2010CoV antigens and RNA. The pathological changes in these organs and tissues may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect (CPE) mediated by SARS\u2010CoV replication in these organs; or indirectly by the systemic toxic reaction due to failure of the respiratory system, or by the harmful immune response and cytokine reaction induced by virus infection.",

Analyzing 72 human tissues by real\u2010time PCR, Harmer et al\n29 demonstrated that ACE2 is expressed in human lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, heart and testis. Consistent with our results, SARS\u2010CoV was detected in lung, gastrointestinal tract and kidney, suggesting that SARS\u2010CoV may utilize ACE2 as a receptor to enter the cells in these organs.

Although there is no report of such transmission 15, caution should be exercised by the at\u2010risk population during the SARS\u2010CoV endemic season. This finding supports the hypothesis that SARS\u2010CoV may be released into the environment via faeces from individuals infected by SARS\u2010CoV. Indeed, low levels of SARS\u2010CoV RNA were detected in faeces from SARS patients 3, 30.
