            "text": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are transcripts larger than 200 nt in length that lack protein-coding ability, have previously been described in mammalian cells (Kapranov et al., 2007; Mattick and Rinn, 2015). Most of them have a structure similar to mRNA; they have a 5\u2032 methylguanosine cap and are usually spliced and polyadenylated at their 3\u2032 termini. Notably, lncRNA expression shows significant cell and tissue specificity (Mercer et al., 2008; Derrien et al., 2012). Emerging evidence shows that non-coding RNAs have a regulatory role in multiple cellular processes, such as genomic imprinting, chromatin modification, and alternative splicing of RNA (Mercer et al., 2009). Moreover, some diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders are also related to the dysregulated expression of lncRNA (Qureshi et al., 2010; Tsai et al., 2011). Numerous studies have been conducted to ascertain their functional role during viral infection. For example, NRAV can promote influenza virus replication and virulence through negatively regulating the initial transcription of varieties of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Ouyang et al., 2014). lncRNA-ACOD1, named by its neighboring coding gene aconitate decarboxylase 1, significantly reduces virus multiplication by directly interacting with the metabolic enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (Wang et al., 2017). Neat1, one of the lncRNAs induced by HIV-1 infection, is retained in the nucleus and serves as a scaffold for the nuclear paraspeckle substructure. Importantly, Neat1 deficiency enhances HIV-1 replication (Zhang et al., 2013). Although large amounts of data have proved that several lncRNAs are involved in different kinds of virus infection, the mechanisms by which they act are still largely unknown.",

            "text": "Porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), a novel emerging pathogenic enterocytetropic virus, was first discovered from the feces of pigs in Hong Kong in 2012. It is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. It belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales (Woo et al., 2012). The genome length of PDCoV is approximately 25.4 kb. It is similar in structure to other coronaviruses, with shorter non-coding regions (5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR) at both terminals. The 3/4 genome from the 5\u2032 end contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding the pp1a and pp1b, respectively. The downstream of the genome encodes structural protein spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), accessory proteins NS6, structural protein nucleocapsid (N), and accessory proteins NS7 and NS7a. A total of 15 non-structural proteins are encoded by the 5\u2032 terminal of the genome (Fang et al., 2017). PDCoV mainly causes acute, watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and mortality in suckling piglets, including lesions in the stomach and lungs (Ma et al., 2015). The first outbreak of PDCoV infection was reported in the United States in early 2014 and, to date, it has been detected in Canada, South Korea, China, Thailand, and Vietnam, thus posing huge threat to the swine industry and attracting a great deal of attention (Lee and Lee, 2014; Dong et al., 2016; Lorsirigool et al., 2017; Ajayi et al., 2018; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2019).",

A previous study showed that NS6 interaction with RIG-I/MDA5 attenuated the binding activity between RIG-I/MDA5 and double-stranded RNA, resulting in a reduced level of IFN-\u03b2 production (Fang et al., 2018). Also, the non-structural protein nsp5, a 3C-like protease, is an important molecule in suppressing type I IFN signaling (Zhu et al., 2017b). In addition, NEMO, an essential modulator of NF-\u03baB, can also be cleaved by nsp5, causing inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production (Zhu et al., 2017a). Though there are many reports of immune evasion by PDCoV, the precise pathogenic mechanism of PDCoV is largely unclear.",

We identified 830 differentially expressed lncRNAs from PDCoV-infected cells.

The distribution of each type of gene was counted according to the expression level. In total, eight categories of RNA were identified, according to database annotation of those transcripts, in which the protein-coding genes were highly represented (66.54% in PS and 69.10% in ST, respectively) (Figure 1A). Next, four software tools, CNCI, CPC, PhyloCSF, and PFAM, were used to calculate the protein-coding potential of assembled-transcripts to screen lncRNAs, then taking the intersection of transcripts with no coding potential in these software products as the novel lncRNA (Figure 1B).

To further determine the characteristics of the lncRNAs identified in the present study, we compared the transcript length, exon number, and degree of conservation between protein-coding genes and lncRNAs. Conservation analysis of exons, introns, and promoters of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes showed that the exons of protein-coding genes were the most conserved and the exons of lncRNA were far less conserved (Figure 1C).

            "text": "Long non-coding RNAs sequences are poorly conserved and do not appear to form large homologous families, so it is difficult to infer their common ancestors by sequence similarity (Ponting et al., 2009). Therefore, it is challenging to predict the functions of a type of lncRNA on the basis of its sequence or structure. There have been reports of using genome-wide association analysis between lncRNAs and the co-expressed and/or co-regulated protein-coding genes to characterize the function of the lncRNA (Huarte et al., 2010). To investigate the putative role of lncRNAs, we first analyzed the whole RNA-seq profiles to identify target protein-coding genes whose location or expression was significantly correlated with the candidate lncRNA. For co-located target gene prediction, we searched coding regions 100 k upstream and downstream of lncRNA. In total, 8,812 pairs of lncRNA-protein-coding genes, containing 2,088 lncRNAs and 3,566 protein-coding genes, were identified (Supplementary Table S3). For co-expressed target gene prediction, the expression correlation between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes was evaluated. When the required Pearson correlation coefficient was set above 0.95, 1,048,575 pairs of lncRNA-protein-coding genes, containing 1,730 lncRNAs and 10,581 protein-coding genes, were obtained (Supplementary Table S4). We next performed GO and KEGG pathway analysis for the target genes of lncRNAs. The top 20 GO and KEGG pathways with the highest representation of each term are reported (Figure 2 and Supplementary Tables S5, S6). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that pathways related to the immune system and metabolism were preferentially targeted. The GO-term analysis was divided into three main categories: cellular component, biological process, and molecular function. Significantly, a large number of biological processes, like protein-DNA complex assembly, DNA packaging and transcription, and the cellular macromolecule metabolic process, were enriched. Furthermore, protein binding and nucleic acid binding and the nucleosome and organelles, belonging to molecular function and cellular component, respectively, were also enriched. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of target genes revealed that lncRNAs may act in cis or trans to participate in the regulation of expression of multiple important genes in different processes including protein binding, DNA transcription, metabolism, and immune response.",

Out of the 1,308 annotated and 1,190 novel lncRNAs, we obtained 454 annotated DE lncRNAs (225 up-regulated and 229 down-regulated) and 376 novel DE lncRNAs (252 up-regulated and 124 down-regulated) after PDCoV infection (p < 0.05; Supplementary Table S7). Importantly, we observed 20 lncRNAs whose expression levels were decreased to FPKM = 0 after PDCoV infection, while the FPKMs of another 12 lncRNAs, all novel lncRNAs, were 0 before PDCoV infection (Supplementary Table S7). This suggests that these 32 lncRNAs, though they have very low expression levels, might be strongly associated with the viral infection. Furthermore, to evaluate the reliability of RNA-seq data analysis, 15 lncRNAs were selected for RT-qPCR analysis in PDCoV-infected cells. As shown in Figure 3B, the expression levels of the 15 selected lncRNAs, though exhibiting no significant differences at 4 h post-infection (hpi), were all significantly changed at 11 hpi in ST cells. Also, different expression patterns of lncRNAs were detected in IPEC-J2 cells. As shown in Figure 3C, 11 out of the 15 selected RNA were significantly altered at 11 hpi, and all of them were differently expressed at 24 hpi.

In general, lncRNAs function either in cis or in trans to affect the transcription of genes within or far from the same genomic locus (Clark and Blackshaw, 2014). To understand the potential functional association between lncRNAs and cognate genes, we investigated their genomic distribution pattern relative to protein-coding loci and classified all DE lncRNAs to ascertain their potential biological roles. All DE lncRNAs were classified into six categories comprising sense-upstream lncRNA, sense-downstream lncRNA, sense-overlapping lncRNA, antisense-upstream lncRNA, antisense-downstream lncRNA and antisense-overlapping lncRNA. As shown in Figure 4A, 26% of DE lncRNAs were located in the same strand but upstream of protein-coding genes and 24% were located downstream, while antisense-upstream and antisense-overlapping comprised 27 and 1%, respectively, and the remaining 22% were antisense-downstream lncRNAs. Next, in order to define the lncRNA functions more precisely, GO enrichment analysis of the co-located genes of up- and down-regulated lncRNAs were analyzed independently. The results showed that protein-coding genes associated with DE lncRNAs were mainly enriched in terms of molecular function and cellular component, primarily under the category of nucleic acid binding and intracellular membrane-bounded organelle (Figure 4B). Notably, by analyzing the relative expression level, we found that antisense lncRNA and protein-coding genes were specifically co-expressed, in which two pairs showed a positive and three pairs showed a negative correlation in their expression patterns (Figure 4C and Supplementary Table S8). We speculated that these antisense lncRNAs act in cis to modulate the expression of their cognate genes.",

The results of comparing clean reads to the genome showed that more than 60% of reads are protein-coding genes, and no lncRNA classifications were identified due to the limited lncRNA database annotation in pig. In our results, 1,190 novel lncRNAs were identified. Further analysis showed that the basic characteristics of these novel lncRNAs are consistent with the known ones. Our RNA-seq results further enrich the pig lncRNA database.",

These lncRNAs were classified as sense-upstream lncRNA, sense-downstream lncRNA, sense-overlapping lncRNA, antisense-upstream lncRNA, antisense-downstream lncRNA, and antisense-overlapping lncRNA. Many antisense-overlapping lncRNAs have inverse expression patterns with their sense transcript counterparts. This suggests that these antisense-overlapping lncRNAs may have a negative regulatory effect on them. In contrast, many lncRNAs that do not contain overlapping sequences display expression patterns correlated with their neighboring protein-coding gene transcripts. In the present study, two out of five antisense overlapping lncRNAs were found to have high consistency in their expression (Figure 4). Similarly, the lncRNA Evx1as, which initiates within the first exon of the gene EVX1, has an overlap of eight nucleotides with the EVX1 mRNA and promotes transcription of its neighbor gene by increasing the binding affinity of histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 4 acetylation (H3K27ac) at the promoter region. Considering that most lncRNAs might function through their secondary structure rather than the primary one, this suggests that the regulation of antisense transcripts by antisense-overlapping lncRNA may not be mediated through base-complementary pairing.",

The main enriched KEGG pathways of these protein-coding genes were in metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. In a recent report, 5-day-old neonatal pigs were infected with PDCoV, and transcriptome profile and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed at different stages of infection (Wu et al., 2019). In our study, we found that the lncRNA targeted genes enriched in those pathways that were perturbed during the late stage of infection. In addition, the expression level of transglutaminase 3 (TGM3) and apolipoprotein A-2 (APOA2) in a Wu et al. (2019) study were significantly changed. Similarly, we also found that TGM1 was up-regulated, and APOA1, APOA4, and APOA5 were down-regulated during PDCoV infection (data not shown). Moreover, our data show that many cytokines and chemokines, which elicit an inflammatory response, were differentially expressed in the infected cells compared to mock cells. The inflammation causes injury to the intestinal tissues, resulting in diarrhea or even death. Raised CCL and CXCL10 levels were associated with the severity of virus infection (Betakova et al., 2017; Masood et al., 2018). Here, we identified a number of lncRNAs that may regulate the expression of these inflammatory molecules.",
