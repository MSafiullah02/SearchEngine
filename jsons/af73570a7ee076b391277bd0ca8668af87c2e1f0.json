The prevalence of HBoV-DNA has been described to vary considerably between 2.7-19% in children suffering from ARTIs and 0.8-9.1% in patients with gastroenteritis. 17, 25, 35, 43 However, since the majority of currently published studies have been performed retrospectively, these variations in viral prevalence may be explained by differences in the study populations and patient characteristics. In infected infants, viral loads have been described to range between < 500 to 10 10 and <10 3 to 5.9 \u00d7 10 5 genome copies in nasopharyngeal aspirates and fecal samples, respectively. 25, 37, 43, 52 In serum, we have detected viral loads of up to 1.2 \u00d7 10 6 /ml. 69 Only limited data is available on the prevalence of HBoV viremia in asymptomatic individuals, since most of the studies have focused on children with distinct clinical symptoms of infectious diseases. In a first study a total of 96 healthy controls were included for diagnostic analysis of HBoV, yet no viral DNA was observed in respiratory samples from these individuals. 16 Furthermore, we were unable to detect HBoV-DNA in sera collected from 298 healthy adult blood donors. However, a recent publication describes the detection of viral genomes in 5% of respiratory samples obtained from asymptomatic children. 24 While most studies have detected the virus during the winter season, 2,28,33,38,46,70 single reports describe increased numbers of viral infections in spring or summer. 9, 31, 40 No information is currently available on the routes of viral transmission. However, since HBoV can be frequently detected in respiratory and fecal samples, a transmission of the virus via aerosols or direct contact has to be presumed. Thereby, the contagiousness of virus-containing body secretions might be potentiated by the exceptional stability of parvoviral virions and might facilitate increased frequencies of nosocomial infections.",

The mean age of these children was 2.1 years. The overall prevalence of HBoVspecific IgG and IgM in children without detectable viral genomes in nasopharyngeal samples was 35% and 13%, respectively. Antibodies against the aminoterminal domain of the viral VP1 protein, termed VP1-unique region, were detected rarely: only 7% (IgG) and 2% (IgM) of the patients showed positive results. In contrast to the data provided by Endo and colleagues and by our group (see below), the prevalence of HBoV-specific IgG was shown to decline from 52% in 1-2 year old infants to 29% in children aged over 5 years in the Finnish study. 21 Furthermore, maternal VP2-specific IgG were not observed in children <6 months of age despite a seemingly high seroprevalence of HBoV in adults. This finding may be due to the maturation of IgG-specificity in the time period of up to 6 months following an acute infection, during which antibodies against linear epitopes get replaced by those preferentially recognizing conformational antigen structures. This process has been well documented for B19V-specific humoral immune responses, 71 and therefore it may be assumed that similar changes in IgG affinity take place during HBoV infections.",

Based on current reports it seems most likely that HBoV may be associated with respiratory infections in young children and infants, while a further connection between HBoV and gastrointestinal symptoms has been suggested. However, as acute HBoV infections are often accompanied by infections with additional pathogens of both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, a final establishment of HBoV as the causative agent of infectious disease in humans needs to be confirmed by additional prospective studies. The methodological heterogeneity used for the diagnosis of HBoV infection raises questions about the specificity and comparability of many published studies, highlighting the urgent need of internationally standardized diagnostic guidelines and reference samples for the detection of HBoV genomes and virus-specific immune responses in human samples. As serological diagnostics of HBoV infection will become more important in the future, standardized viral DNA and antibody specimen should be provided as a basis to establish comparable test systems.",
