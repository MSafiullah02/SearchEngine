            "text": "An epidemiological investigation aims to quickly determine the prevalence of an infectious disease whilst simultaneously revealing the cause, and source of the disease, and explore the transmission process to ultimately prevent the spread of the infectious disease [1]. As individuals become the source of the infectious disease, and if person-to-person transmission is suspected, it is important to immediately identify, and manage people that are in close contact with suspected patients [2,3]. In particular, if there are several unknown epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and an effective medical intervention is lacking (as in the case of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19), contact management becomes 1 of the core strategies to minimize additional transmission. For these strategies to be successful, it is necessary to evaluate between-person exposure risk in all locations where there have been confirmed cases (after the onset of symptoms), and to classify contact persons based on this risk. Furthermore, it is also important to eliminate the possibility of exposure to infection in the places visited by the confirmed patient, by performing the appropriate disinfection of areas that can harbor environmental contamination [2]. However, traditional investigative methods, depending on the patient or proxy interview, has the limitation of omissions and errors of previous activities.",

Furthermore, making accurate information available to the general public helps to minimize fear and confusion with respect to the risk of transmissibility of the disease. The use of methods that have objectively verified the patient\u2019s route claims (medical facility records, GPS, card transactions, and CCTV) for COVID-19 contact investigations in South Korea has provided accurate information on the location, and time of exposure, and details of the situation, thus reducing omissions in a patient\u2019s route due to recall or confirmation bias that may have arisen from patient or proxy interviews.",

Epidemiological investigations require the collaboration of various related persons and must be conducted through a strict verification process.
