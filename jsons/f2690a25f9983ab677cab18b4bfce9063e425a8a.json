According to current data, diabetic patients do not appear to be at increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general population.

The characteristics of diabetic patients at risk for developing severe and critical forms of COVID-19, as well as the prognostic impact of diabetes on the course of COVID-19, are under current investigation. Obesity, the main risk factor for incident type 2 diabetes, is more common in patients with critical forms of COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, COVID-19 is usually associated with poor glycemic control and a higher risk of ketoacidosis in diabetic patients. There are currently no recommendations in favor of discontinuing antihypertensive medications that interact with the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system. Metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued in patients with severe forms of COVID-19 owing to the risks of lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis. Finally, we advise for systematic screening for (pre)diabetes in patients with proven COVID-19 infection.",

Severity criteria, defined by the Chinese National Health Committee, include tachypnea (respiratory rate \u226530/minute), oxygen saturation \u226493% at rest, and/or an oxygenation index \u2264300mmHg and/or lung infiltrates >50% developing over 24-48 hours. Severe forms require supportive therapy with oxygen, while critical forms include the onset of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), shock, and/or multi-organ failure, all requiring admission to an ICU and invasive procedures. These severe and critical forms of COVID-19 are more frequent in elderly patients (>60 years) with one or more underlying chronic conditions [8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Beside diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease are the most frequently reported comorbidities ( Table 2 ) [27] .",

C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL6)), elevated tissue enzymes (eg. lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), and clotting abnormalities (eg. elevated D-dimer). According to the authors, these abnormalities are related to severe multi-organ damage and to a propensity to thromboembolic events, as well as to the \"cytokine storm\" described as an aggravating factor of COVID-19 [33] . Finally, lymphopenia, frequently reported as marker of poor prognosis [8, 13, 15] , was more frequent and more severe in diabetic patients.

In Belgium, the overall mortality ascribed to COVID-19 has been reported jointly for hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. At the time of writing this article, the case fatality rate in Belgium reached 15% of diagnosed individuals (representing an incidence rate of 68.7/100.000 inhabitants); 45% of deaths occurred in hospitals and 55% in home care facilities [5, 6] . Again, these figures should be interpreted with caution, according to the known limitations regarding screening and diagnostic testing as well as inclusion of suspected yet unconfirmed death cases ascribed to the virus especially in homes care facilities. By comparison, the case fatality rate reached 19% of diagnosed individuals in France (incidence rate of 37.2/100.000 individuals), 63% of deaths occurring in hospitals and 37% in home care facilities [5, 10] . However, overall mortality due to COVID-19 is lower as all affected patients did not undergo testing. According to published data by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, worldwide case fatality rate is currently 7% [5] and universal screening should likely further decrease these estimates.",

Diabetes and hyperglycemia were identified as factors that negatively influence the prognosis of sepsis and pneumococcal pneumonia, as well as that of SARS, MERS and H1N1 influenza [9] . The impact of diabetes and obesity was studied in a transgenic mouse model expressing the human DDP4, the entry receptor of MERS-CoV [35] . Transgenic diabetic mice with MERS-CoV infection showed more severe viral pneumonia and lung injury characterized by delayed initiation of inflammation and slower inflammatory resolution. These findings suggest that a dysregulated immune response is the basis of increased coronaviruses infection severity in diabetics. In vitro studies showed indeed that hyperglycemia alters innate immunity, induces endothelial dysfunction and promotes a pro-coagulant state [19] . In vivo studies also showed that hyperglycemia prolongs the duration of the cytokine response triggered by infection in mouse models of diabetes [19] . Finally, in vitro hyperglycemia alters the pulmonary epithelium and promotes infection with the influenza virus [9] . Although the clinical relevance of these preclinical data must be confirmed, especially in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, they could explain the severity of the biological and radiological picture described by Guo ",

These associations might be more pronounced in men in whom overweight and obesity were respectively associated with a 1.96-fold and 5.7-fold increased risk, compared to a 1.51-fold and a 0.71-fold risk in women [38] . A French study (Lille) showed a high prevalence of obesity (48%) among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU as well as an increasing requirement of IMV according to BMI [39] . In this study, 86% of patients with severe or morbid obesity (BMI \u2265 35 kg/m\u00b2) required IMV, against 47% of patients with normal weight (BMI <25 kg/m\u00b2). In Belgium, the mean prevalence of obesity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reached 10.5% (Table 1) , a figure surprisingly lower than the 16% prevalence found in the general population, as reported in the 2018 Health Survey [1, 6] . In contrast, obesity was reported in 36% to 50% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States [16, 40, 41] whereas the prevalence of obesity reached 35% in the general population in 2016 according to the WHO [2] . In Italy, the prevalence of obesity and T2DM among patients who died from COVID-19 did not differ between women and men, respectively 31.4% versus 31.9% and 12.7% versus 11.0% [31] . 66 .7%, respectively, in the general population of these countries [2] . A first link between body weight excess and severity of COVID-19 infection is the negative impact of obesity on the pulmonary function, including reduced expiratory reserve, functional capacity, and respiratory system compliance; as well as decreased diaphragmatic movements with abdominal obesity in supine position [36] . Inflammation might be a second link between obesity and severe forms of COVID-19. Indeed, the risk for developing ARDS as well as the outcomes of ARDS have been linked to a series of genes and their variants including those coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6), chemokines and ACE [47] while obesity is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and elevated plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6) and complement overactivation [36] . Moreover, epicardial fat whose volume is increased in obese individuals and lung adipocytes might play a role in cardiac and lung injuries caused by COVID-19 [45, 46] . Available data regarding obesity in patients with COVID-19 are summarized in Table 3 .",

Although intensive insulin therapy was previously shown to improve both mortality and morbidity of diabetic and non-diabetic patients admitted in the ICU [52] , hypoglycemia induced by intensive insulin therapy was identified as an independent risk factor of death in patients with critical medical conditions including sepsis and bacteremia [53] . The potentially deleterious effects of too tight a glycemic control, predisposing to hypoglycemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients admitted to ICU, was further confirmed in multicenter studies [54] . Metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued in severe forms of COVID-19, given their intrinsic risk of lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, respectively.

Indeed, it is commonly admitted that certain viral diseases can trigger autoimmune type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible patients, or even produce fulminant diabetes from mass collapse of \u03b2 cells. COVID-19 makes use of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme type 2 (ACE2) receptor as \"gateway\" to invade target cells in humans [56] . This enzyme is expressed by different tissues and cell types, including the lungs as well as the endocrine pancreas [56] . A Chinese study has suggested that infection with SARS-CoV, which also uses ACE2 receptor as entry receptor, could damage the islets of Langerhans, causing hyperglycemia over the course of infection [57] . In contrast, this study did not demonstrate an increased risk of diabetes in the long term. Another Chinese study reported pancreatic injury assessed by elevations of plasma amylase and lipase levels in 17% of patients with COVID-19, among whom 67% had moderately elevated plasma glucose [58] . The question remains therefore open regarding COVID-19 and risk of new-onset diabetes.",

ACE2 also acts as the receptor that allows entry of emergent coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) into human cells [56] . The SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein, once bound to ACE2, is activated by the type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) to promote invasion and viral replication within targets human cells, including type II pneumocytes [56] . ACE inhibitors (ACEI) typically inhibit ACE1 but not ACE2 [61] . On the other hand, ACE2 exerts a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and Bcell function [58, 62] . Preclinical studies have shown that diabetes alters the activity and/or expression of ACE2 in the serum and tissues of different murine models [58, 62, 63] . As an example, rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes have a reduced pulmonary expression of ACE2 mRNA while NOD mice, developing spontaneously auto-immune diabetes mimicking type 1 diabetes, have increased expression of ACE2 in both the lung and the heart [58, 63] . Yet the relevance of such findings in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection needs clarification.",

            "text": "RAAS inhibitors might increase the tissue expression of ACE2, thus raising theoretical concerns about increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and poorer prognosis of infected patients on RAAS blockers [60, 64] . Yet currently published studies did not find increased infectivity of COVID-19 in patients with previous treatment with RAAS inhibitors. Indeed, a population-based case-control study performed in Italy (Lombardy) including more than 6000 patients, did not find any evidence that RAAS inhibitors affected the risk of COVID-19 [64] .An observational study including more than 12.500 patients tested for COVID-19 in New York also did not find an association between previous treatment with RAAS inhibitors and higher risk of testing positive for COVID-19 [65] . Moreover, these molecules could also have beneficial effects in patients with lung injury caused by COVID-19. Preclinical data showed that mice infected with SARS-CoV and receiving losartan had reduced lung injury compared to untreated mice [9, 60] . This protective effect was associated with an increased expression of ACE2 in response to losartan [9, 60] . In humans, studies reported decreased mortality and lesser requirement of IMV in patients with viral pneumonia receiving RAAS blockers [9] . RAAS blockers could have beneficial immunomodulatory effects at systemic and pulmonary levels by decreasing cytokines [9] . A retrospective Chinese study of 112 patients with prior cardiovascular disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection showed the same proportion of patients taking RAAS blockers among survivors and non-survivors [37] . The benefit of maintaining RAAS blockers prescribed for chronic cardiovascular and/or chronic renal diseases might exceed their potential harm in patients with COVID-19 as RAAS inhibitors might protect against organ and myocardial injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 [60] . A recent Chinese study showed a lower risk of all-cause mortality in hospitalized patient with both COVID-19 and hypertension receiving RAAS blockers compared to non-treated patients [66] . Moreover, RAAS inhibitors were not associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 neither in Lombardy nor in New York [64, 65] . Thus, overall, the current recommendation is to continue RAAS inhibitors in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients during acute COVID-19 infection [60,64-66].",

The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) liraglutide was shown to counteract the downregulating effect of diabetes on the pulmonary expression of ACE2 in rats without influencing glucose and insulin levels [58] . GLP-1-RAs were also shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and to reduce lung inflammation in murine models of experimental lung injury [58] . In humans, GLP-1 RAs reduce circulating inflammatory biomarkers in diabetic and/or obese patients while insulin reduces these biomarkers in critically-ill patients [58] . Pioglitazone was also shown to upregulate ACE2 in hepatocytes of rats fed a high J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 fat diet [9] . Finally, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is the entry receptor of MERS-CoV, raising concerns about the impact of DPP-4 inhibitors during the course of coronavirus infection [9] . Yet the clinical relevance of these preclinical and human data in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection needs clarification [67] . As for the GLP-1 RA, they have been safely used for blood glucose control in critically ill and ventilated patients in short term studies [58] ; but there is insufficient hindsight to recommend their use in diabetic patients with COVID-19 [67] .",
