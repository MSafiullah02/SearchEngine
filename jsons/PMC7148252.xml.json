For example, an Operator Tree (OPT) is used in Fig. 1 to represent math formulas where operands are represented by leaves and operators are located at internal nodes. This facilitates searching substructures shared by two math expressions. For example, we can extract paths from their tree representations and find their shared subtrees by matching their common paths grouped by subtree root nodes. However, in order to carry structure information, it is common to see structural queries with over tens or even hundreds of path tokens which is unusual for normal fulltext search. This makes query processing costly for realistic math search tasks.",

However, effective substructure search requires additional matching or alignment among query terms, and this makes it hard to get a good score estimation and it prevents us applying traditional dynamically pruning effectively. In fact, reportedly few state-of-the-art MIR systems have achieved practical query run times even when given a large amount of computing resources [11, 20]. In this paper we try to address this problem by introducing a specialized inverted index and we propose a dynamic pruning method based on this inverted index to boost formula retrieval efficiency.",

            "text": "A number of MIR systems apply text search models to math retrieval, extracting sequential features from formulas and use variants of TF-IDF scoring [12, 14, 16]. These approaches incorporate a bag-of-words model, and use frequency to measure formula similarity. Inevitably, they need to index different combinations of sequences or substrings to handle operator commutativity and subexpression identification. This index augmentation results in a non-linearly increasing index size in the number of indexed \u201cwords\u201d [12] and thus hurts efficiency for large corpora. On the other hand, recent results [10, 20, 23] reveal that effective systems for formula retrieval use tree-based approaches distinct from text-based methods. However, tree-based systems usually need to calculate costly graph matching or edit distance metrics [9, 22], which generally have non-linear time complexity. Recently, a path-based approach [23] was developed to search substructures in formula OPTs approximately by assuming that identical formulas have the same leaf-root path set. Although at the time of writing, it obtains the best effectiveness for the NTCIR-12 dataset, the typically large number of query paths means that query run times are not ideal - maximum run times can be a couple of seconds.",

            "text": "Dynamic pruning has been recognized as an effective way to reduce query processing times [2, 8, 13, 18]. Dynamic pruning speeds up query processing by skipping scoring calculations or avoiding unnecessary reads for documents which are unlikely to be ranked in the top K results. Pruning methods can be based on different query processing schemes: Document-at-a-time (DAAT) requires all relevant posting lists be merged simultaneously. Term-at-a-time (TAAT) or score-at-a-time (SAAT) processes one posting list at a time for each term, requiring additional memory to store partial scores, and posting lists in this case are usually sorted by document importance (e.g, impact score [1]), with promising documents placed at the front of inverted lists. Pruning strategies are rank-safe (or safe up to rank K) [19] if they guarantee that the top K documents are ranked in the same order before and after pruning. The most well-known rank-safe pruning strategies for DAAT are MaxScore [8, 17, 19] and WAND variants [3, 6]. Shan et al. [15] show that MaxScore variants (e.g. BMM, LBMM) outperform other dynamic pruning strategies for long queries, and recently Mallia et al.

In Fig. 1, when indexing \u201cbc + xy + a + z,\u201d its expression ID (or ExpID) will be appended to posting lists associated with tokenized prefix paths from its OPT representation, i.e., VAR/TIMES, VAR/ADD and VAR/TIMES/ADD.

Since work in formula retrieval is relatively new, there are only 40 queries in NTCIR-12 that can be compared with other published systems. However, these queries are well designed to cover a variety of math expressions in different complexity. There are 20 queries containing wildcards in this task (using wildcard specifier \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\varvec{\\backslash }{} \\mathbf{qvar} $$\\end{document} to match arbitrary subexpression or symbols, e.g., query \u201c\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\backslash $$\\end{document}qvar{a}\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$^2$$\\end{document} + \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\backslash $$\\end{document}qvar{b}\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$^3$$\\end{document}\u201d can match \u201c\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$x^2 + (y + 1)^3$$\\end{document}\u201d).

We compare the baseline best performed run (base-best) which uses costly multiple tree matching as well as its specialized version (base-opd-only) which considers only the largest matched tree width (see Eq. 2). Tangent-S has a few outliers as a result of its costly alignment algorithm to rerank structure and find the Maximum Subtree Similarity [22], its non-linear complexity makes it expensive for some long queries (especially in wildcard case). And MCAT reportedly has a median query execution time around 25 s, using a server machine and multi-threading [11]. So we remove Tangent-S outliers and MCAT from runtime boxplot.
