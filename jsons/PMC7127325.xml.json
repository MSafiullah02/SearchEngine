Communicable respiratory illnesses lead to large excesses in expenses associated with healthcare, absence from work, and lost worker productivity [1], but the control of airborne infectious disease transmission in indoor environments is not yet entirely understood [2]. Several studies have shown that building design and operational characteristics such as increased outdoor air ventilation rates, lower occupant density, and use of UV germicidal irradiation can reduce the risk of infectious disease transmission inside buildings [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Similarly, commonly available particle filters in recirculating heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems may also be used to reduce the risk of airborne infectious disease transmission, depending on the nature of infectious aerosols and some important building characteristics [2], [4], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].",

To address these questions, this article describes and applies a methodology for estimating the impact of recirculating HVAC filters on the control of size-resolved infectious aerosols in indoor environments using a modified version of the Wells-Riley model for predicting risks of airborne infectious disease transmission. Estimates of likely risk reductions and associated operational costs of both HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation are modeled and compared using a case study of airborne transmission of influenza in a hypothetical office space in multiple climates.",

Because of this assumption, the model cannot distinguish between long-range transport of smaller infectious aerosols (i.e., droplet nuclei) and close-contact airborne spread of infectious diseases that occurs when expelled infectious aerosols deposit directly on susceptible parts of the human body (i.e., large droplets). However, quanta generation rates are usually back calculated from scenarios where long-range transport was very likely a major factor. For example, Rudnick and Milton (2003) estimated quanta generation rates of 15\u2013128 per hour for influenza (depending on steady-state or dynamic assumptions) using data from a grounded passenger airplane where the majority of passengers throughout the airplane acquired the influenza virus from one infected individual [23]. While the quanta generation rates in this case may have accounted for some close-range transport, it is reasonable to assume that many passengers would also have been infected by longer-range aerosol transport.",

Because the removal mechanisms of any aerosol (including HVAC filtration) are primarily functions of particle size [32], [33], it is important to consider the actual particle size distributions of infectious aerosols in indoor environments for use with this model. Although the original Wells-Riley model does not explicitly account for the size-resolved nature of infectious aerosols, modifications have been made by others to do so [4], [34], [35]. Therefore, the next sections describe previous efforts to integrate other size-dependent loss terms into the Wells-Riley equation and then review existing knowledge of particle size distributions of infectious aerosols to inform the modeling effort herein. Infectious particle size distributions are explored with the specific intent of generalizing for use with the particle size range relevant to a common HVAC filtration standard: ASHRAE Standard 52.2 [36].",

In fact, the steady-state Wells-Riley equation has previously been modified in other investigations to include additional removal terms other than outdoor air ventilation, including filtration by personal respirators, UV degradation, particle deposition, and HVAC particle filtration [3], [4], [10], [31]. Equation (2) follows the same procedures by including both HVAC filtration and deposition loss terms.(2)Pinfection=1\u2212exp[IqptV/(\u03bbventilation+kfiltration+kdeposition)]where V = indoor air volume (m3); \u03bb\nventilation = outdoor air ventilation rate (Q\noa/V, 1/hr); k\nfiltration = infectious particle removal rate due to filtration (1/hr); and k\ndeposition = infectious particle deposition rate (1/hr). Deposition removal rates (k\ndeposition) depend primarily on particle size, density, and room characteristics such as airspeeds and surface areas [35], [37]. Filtration removal rates (k\nfiltration) depend on the rate of airflow through the HVAC filter (Q\nfilter), the fractional operation time of the HVAC system (f\nHVAC), and the size-resolved infectious particle removal efficiency of the filter or air-cleaning device installed (\u03b7\nfilter) as shown in Equation (3). The airflow rate through the filter divided by the volume of the indoor air space served and multiplied by fractional operation time is also called the recirculation rate (\u03bb\nrecirculated).(3)kfiltration=fHVACQfilter\u03b7filterV=\u03bbrecirculated\u03b7filterwhere f\nHVAC = fractional HVAC operation time (\u2212); Q\nfilter = airflow rate through filter (m3/hr); \u03b7\nfilter = particle removal efficiency of the filter (\u2212); and \u03bb\nrecirculated = recirculation rate through the HVAC filter (1/hr). Depending on the nature of the virus or bacteria of concern inside of expelled droplets or droplet nuclei, some rate of inactivation may also occur as aerosols are exposed to indoor air [34]. This rate has been explored for some viruses [38], [39] and is dependent in part on environmental conditions such as relative humidity. However, we have excluded this loss rate in this work in part because of a lack of existing data on size-resolved inactivation rates for multiple infectious aerosols of concern and in part because quanta generation rates, when back calculated using Equation (1), should inherently account for any inactivation that occurred during the case study period. Additionally, although Equations (2), (3) are shown without explicitly considering particle size effects, both the filtration and deposition loss parameters (k\ndeposition and k\nfiltration) are size-dependent. Therefore, the following sections describe existing knowledge of the particle size distributions of infectious aerosols.",

In other explorations of the impacts of particle filtration and other size-dependent processes on virus and bacteria disease transmission, some researchers have assumed that the individual virus or bacteria particles are aerosolized and exist suspended as individual organisms [11], [41]; however, it is likely more appropriate to consider the particles as larger expelled droplets that contain aggregates of the smaller infectious particles within Refs.

Nicas et al. [35] summarized nearly 50 years of measurements of particle size distributions of droplets emitted by humans during coughing and sneezing and reported that cough-generated aerosols could be divided into two lognormally distributed modes: (i) a small particle size distribution with a geometric mean diameter of \u223c10 \u03bcm (ii) a large particle size distribution with a geometric mean diameter of \u223c160 \u03bcm. However, the smaller particle size distribution was found to contain the majority of cough particles (\u223c70%). Given that the same authors described some evidence of smaller particles being more infectious than larger particles, it appears that smaller (i.e., <10 \u03bcm) particles are likely of greatest concern for droplet nuclei transmission of infectious diseases. Several more recent studies utilizing more advanced measurement techniques have revealed a general consensus that the majority (often 80\u201390%) of particles expelled during various human activities are actually smaller than 1\u20132 \u03bcm in diameter [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], although it is not clear whether actual virus content scales more with particle number, surface area, or volume distributions.",

Sampling environments included healthcare centers, daycare centers, hospital emergency rooms, simulated patient rooms, and in the coughing/breathing zone of both people and manikins. Sampling locations within each environment included both stationary indoor measurements and personal measurements. Importantly, the variety of aerosol samplers used also varied in their particle size cut-off points. However, each study characterized virus content in three generally similar bins: (i) particles smaller than 1 \u03bcm, (ii) particles 1 \u03bcm to 2.5\u20134.9 \u03bcm, depending on the sampler type, and (iii) particles larger than bin (ii). Influenza virus content varied widely in each of these size bins across each study. For example, the average virus content in the smallest size bin (<1 \u03bcm) ranged from 4% in a hospital emergency room to 42% in the immediate vicinity of coughing human subjects. Conversely, the largest size bin contained 5\u201364% of virus content, depending on sampler and environment, although the majority of studies revealed that at least 35% of virus content was associated with the largest size bin.",

Therefore, we adjusted each of the reported size distributions in Table 2 to fit within those three particle size ranges by assuming that the virus content has a uniform distribution in each particle size bin. These assumed distributions are shown in the rightmost columns in Table 2. Although this assumption introduces some uncertainty, we have no way of directly quantifying the magnitude at this time. We do however explore uncertainty in a later section using both the mean and relative standard deviations of the assumed viral size distributions, as summarized in the bottom of Table 2, which can place likely bounds on risk estimates made using Equation (2).",

For simplicity, we assume constant values of k\ndeposition based on size-resolved values used in Riley et al. (2002) [33], [61]. Using a geometric mean diameter between 0.3 and 1 \u03bcm (0.55 \u03bcm), between 1 and 3 \u03bcm (1.7 \u03bcm), and between 3 and 10 \u03bcm (5.5 \u03bcm), deposition rates were estimated as \u223c0.10 per hour, \u223c0.45 per hour, and \u223c3.0 per hour, respectively (taken directly from their Fig. 3). When combined with the mean infectious particle size distributions from Table 2, these lead to a mean size-weighted estimate of \u223c1.7 per hour for k\ndeposition for particles containing the influenza virus. Values for k\ndeposition ranged from \u223c1.0 to \u223c2.3 per hour depending on the range of infectious particle size distributions assumed from Table 2.

We assumed that the office building did not operate continuously year-round, but that it operated \u223c31% of the time (i.e., 11 h per day from 7 am to 6 pm to accommodate staff members, excluding holidays and weekends). We used the defined operational schedule and hourly TMY3 (typical meteorological year) weather data to calculate HDDs and CDDs for each hour of assumed operation [68]. HDDs and CDDs were calculated using a base temperature of 18.3 \u00b0C. Estimates of HDDs and CDDs utilized in the model are shown in Table 5\n, along with estimated annual costs of supplying one unit of outdoor ventilation air in each climate. We assumed electricity rates were constant at $0.12/kWh and that natural gas rates were $8/MMBTU (1 MMBTU = 1055 MJ). These are generally in line with national average rates although we do not explore geographic variations for simplicity.",

Labor costs were estimated directly from Bek\u00f6 et al. (2008) as $12 per filter installation and $5 per filter disposal. Assuming each filter is 24\u2033 \u00d7 24\u2033 (0.6 \u00d7 0.6 m), the number of filters required for the office environment was estimated by (i) dividing the airflow rate through the HVAC filter by an assumed constant 2 m/s face velocity, which yields the approximate area of filtration required, and (ii) determining the number of 24\u2033 \u00d7 24\u2033 (61 \u00d7 61 cm) filters to achieve that approximate area, rounding to the nearest whole number. This yielded one filter required in the hypothetical office environment. Annual labor costs were estimated by multiplying the labor cost of changing one filter ($12 + $5 = $17 per filter) by the estimated number of filter replacements during one year of operation. The initial costs of filtration products and the typical expected filter life spans were taken from an anonymous contact in the commercial filtration industry, as shown in Table 6\n.

For MERV 13 and greater, risk reductions are limited not by filtration efficiency but by the amount of airflow recirculating through the HVAC system and filter. Increasing recirculation rates may show stronger impacts of higher efficiency filters; however, these results suggest that MERV 13 can reduce the risk of influenza infection by as many as two individuals in this environment.

To compare OA ventilation in each location directly to HVAC filtration, OA ventilation rates have been adjusted to achieve the same removal rate as that of each level of HVAC filtration. For example, a MERV 15 filter is expected to achieve 1.37 per hour in infectious droplet nuclei removal in the office environment with the mean assumption for infectious particle size distributions; for outdoor air ventilation to achieve the same risk reduction as filtration, the office HVAC system would need to provide 1.37 additional air changes per hour of outdoor air ventilation. Therefore, OA ventilation and HVAC filtration can be thought of as equivalent in terms of risk reduction (on the y-axis), but will differ in their cost estimates (on the x-axis). For each of the four geographic locations, the cost per unit ($ per 1/hr) ventilation energy costs from Table 5 was used to estimate the cost of providing this equivalent reduction.",

MERV 13 and MERV 14 filters appear to achieve an optimal combination of lowest risk reductions at least costs. MERV 4 is actually more expensive to operate than providing equivalent outdoor air ventilation in each climate, primarily because of the very low effectiveness in controlling infectious aerosols. HEPA filtration appears to offer only a small incremental advantage over MERV 13\u201316 filters (i.e., 1\u20134% lower RR) for as much as 1.6\u20132.3 times the cost of operation, which suggests that MERV 13\u201316 filters may be most appropriate for cost-effectively reducing risks of influenza transmission in this particular indoor environment. In fact, switching from MERV 7 to MERV 13 could likely reduce the number of infected individuals in this office environment by one person at an additional annual cost of only $17. Compared to the estimated economic losses of a single influenza case of $375, MERV 13 filtration could provide a benefit-to-cost ratio of 20 or more. These basic relationships were not sensitive to the various assumptions for infectious particle size distributions.",

D\u2013R models have been used in recent studies to model infectious disease transmission using more mechanistic properties of both tuberculosis [73] and influenza [39], [71]; however, D\u2013R models also have their own inherent limitations, including often requiring interspecies extrapolation to estimate susceptibility of a human subject. Regardless, results from the modeling effort herein demonstrate that HVAC filtration can very likely play a role in preventing the transmission of airborne infectious diseases at lower costs than providing an equivalent amount of outdoor air ventilation, as previous studies have typically explored [3], [4], [6], [7].",

Based on a series of assumptions about infectious particle size distributions resulting from human activities in indoor environments, the risk of acquiring the influenza virus from a single infector was modeled in a hypothetical office environment with a particular focus on what levels of risk reductions could be achieved by different levels of HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation, and at what costs of operation. Overall, recirculating HVAC filtration was predicted to achieve the greatest risk reductions at lower costs of operation than equivalent outdoor air ventilation, particularly for MERV 13\u201316 filters. Medium efficiency filtration products (MERV 7\u201311) are also inexpensive to operate but appear less effective in reducing infectious disease risks.",
