Wildlife has a critical value in maintaining the integrity of the planet's ecosystem, however it often represents an important risk of emerging zoonoses (Carlos and Felipe, 2008, Kruse et al., 2004, Thompson et al., 2009, Thompson and Murrell, 2005). Over the last few decades approximately 75% of emerged diseases, including zoonoses, were of wildlife origin (Bengis et al., 2004, Brown, 2004, FAO, 2011, Jones et al., 2008). Rabies, plague and West Nile virus disease have been known to be associated with wildlife since ancient times (Kruse et al., 2004). Emerging zoonotic pathogens have originated from many wildlife species such as carnivores, ungulates, rodents, bats and primates (Chomel et al., 2007, Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). The role of wildlife in the introduction of diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Nipah from neighboring regions in Asia is well recognized.",

In addition to human infection, KFD virus commonly infects the black faced langur (Presbytis entellus) and red faced bonnet monkey (Macaca radiate) (Pattnaik, 2006). Kyasanur forest disease virus also circulates in small animals such as rodents, shrews and birds (Banerjee, 1988). A recent upsurge in KFD has been reported (Kasabi et al., 2013a, Kasabi et al., 2013b). Antibodies against KFD virus have also been detected in humans in parts of Gujarat (semi-arid area, around 1200 km away from the main focus of KFD), isolated localities of West Bengal state and Andaman and Nicobar islands of India (Pattnaik, 2006).",

            "text": "The epizootiology of KFD in wild monkeys of Shimoga, specifically the death of monkeys in dry seasons (February and March) correlates well with human cases of KFD (Goverdhan et al., 1974). Recently, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus was recovered from a dead jungle crow (Corvus macrohynchos) in Assam near the epicentre of an H5N1 outbreak in poultry (Nagarajan et al., 2010). The HPAI H5N1 virus is highly contagious among birds, especially domestic poultry. Japanese encephalitis was first recognized in 1955 in India and subsequently many human outbreaks have been reported. Ardeid birds such as pond herons (Ardeola grayii), cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis) and little egrets (Egretta garzetta) were infected with Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus and probably play a key role in the maintenance of these viruses in some parts of India (Buescher et al., 1959, Soman et al., 1977). Hanta virus is a rodent-borne virus and there are reports of serological evidence of anti-hantavirus IgM antibodies in human patients in India (Chandy et al., 2008). Wild indigenous small mammals including rodents such as bandicoot (Bandicota bengalensis), black rats (Rattus rattus), house mice (Mus musculus) and shrew (Suncus murinus) act as reservoir hosts for Hanta virus (Carey et al., 1971, Chandy et al., 2013, Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997). In northern India, Pteropus giganteus bats live in close association with human populations (Smith et al., 2008). Isolation of Nipah virus from Pteropus bats probably indicates their important role in its transmission in India (Yadav et al., 2012). Furthermore, the DNA sequence analysis of different genes indicates much similarity with Nipah virus which was isolated from earlier outbreaks in India (Yadav et al., 2012). Ingestion of contaminated fresh date palm sap and remnants of previously eaten fruits, and contact with infected animals are important risk factors for human infection. Rabies of Arctic-like lineage has also been recorded from India (Nadin-Davis et al., 2007). Given the relatively close phylogeny between rabies virus variants of the Indian dog and arctic fox, the role of wildlife in maintaining rabies in India should be thoroughly studied (Nadin-Davis et al., 2007). For human rabies, contacts with jackals, cats, monkeys, mongooses and foxes were found to be associated with 1.7, 0.8, 0.4, 0.4 and 3%, respectively, of the reported cases (Bhatia et al., 2004, Matha and Salunke, 2005, Wilde, 2005). In India, about 20,000 human deaths are reported every year due to rabies most of them due to bites from rabid dogs (Sudarshan et al., 2007), of which about 60% are strays and 40% are owned pets (Menezes 2008).",

A recent occurrence of multiple outbreaks of human trichinellosis after the consumption of raw or undercooked wild boar meat (Sethi et al., 2012) indicates the presence of Trichinella species in wild boar populations in India. Hydatid cysts have been detected in the lungs of Nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus \u2013 wild cattle) (Leishangthem et al., 2010). Cystic echinococcosis is a serious concern in buffaloes (Singh et al., 2014), but because it is considered livestock in India it is not discussed in this paper. A wild boar was found to be infected with Cysticercus cellulosae (Taenia solium) at the Calcutta Zoo, India, in the period 1966\u20131969 (Leishangthem et al., 2010). Leishmanial antibodies have been detected in wild rats (Rattus sp.) (Singh et al., 2013), and Indian Desert Gerbil (Meriones hurrianae) are considered the reservoir host in India (Gramiccia and Gradoni, 2005). The surge in population of Meriones is a potential source for cutaneous leishmaniasis outbreaks in humans (Elfari et al., 2005). The occurrence of, and a fatal human infection due to, Echinococcus multilocularis have been reported in India (Aikat et al., 1978). Zoonotic simian malaria which emerged in the union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar islands has been reported among the human population (Kalra, 1980, Singh et al., 2010).",

Expanding agriculture results in habitat destruction of wildlife and increases the risk of human contact with wildlife related zoonotic pathogens.

Urbanization and increasing incomes have led to an increase in the per-capita consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy products particularly in the developing world, leading to what has been termed the \u201cLivestock Revolution\u201d (Pearson et al., 2005). Livestock production may double again by 2020 (Pearson et al., 2005). This has disturbed the ecological balance as many forests have been clear-cut to provide for additional farmland. Increasing milk production (locally referred to as \u201cwhite revolution\u201d) has led to continuously increasing livestock population and has resulted in expanding livestock habitats. This has reduced wildlife habitats which are increasingly shared with livestock and humans. Furthermore, the use of wildlife reserve areas for livestock grazing and fodder collection acts as an important risk factor for sharing of zoonotic pathogens between wildlife and livestock species. Recently, a case of tick (D. auratus) bite was reported in a human subject in Kerala (Ajithkumar et al., 2012). The tick D. auratus has already been reported to carry many Rickettsiae and viruses and most importantly KFD virus which causes a fatal zoonotic disease in the country. Spread of this tick might have occurred due to migration of wildlife or transportation of livestock (Ajithkumar et al., 2012) from D. auratus prevalent Kyasanur forest and surrounding area of Karnataka state to the neighboring district Wayanad of Kerala.",

Such conflicts usually result in illegal hunting and consumption of wild animal meat with high risk of diseases such as trichinellosis, echinococcosis and taeniosis. Human\u2013wildlife conflicts associated with elephants, leopards, sloth bears and tigers have also been recorded (Thomassen et al., 2011). Wolf and jackal associated injuries to humans indicate an important risk for human rabies (Thomassen et al., 2011). Wolves and other wild canids occur in locations close to human dominated areas in India. Free roaming domestic dogs are common in such landscapes, and are known reservoir of rabies (Thomassen et al., 2011). A potential for spillover of canine rabies to wolves and other canids exists; and rabies might play an important role in human-wolf conflict (Thomassen et al., 2011). Human\u2013monkey conflicts in northern India were also reported (Distefano, 2005). Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), Hanuman langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) and lion-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are known to be involved in such conflicts (Dutta, 2012).",

Illegal hunting and bush meat trade may expose humans to previously unknown pathogens. Despite the ban on hunting, poor law enforcement has facilitated illegal hunting for poachers and forest dwellers in India. There are several indigenous tribes in the country who hunt for food, trade, culture and leisure (Aiyadurai et al., 2010). Additional research is required to estimate consumption rates of wild meat.",

It is anticipated that climate change will result in a shift towards more humid forests in the north-eastern regions and drier forests in the north-western regions (MOEF, 2004). The climate-sensitive sectors (forests, agriculture, coastal zones) and natural resources (groundwater, soil, biodiversity, etc.) are already under stress due to socio-economic pressures.

Environmental conditions such as floods and droughts (extreme events), temperature, humidity, and soil pH have the potential to influence emergence and re-emergence of wildlife related zoonotic pathogens. Floods and droughts may force sharing of resources such as food, water and habitat between wildlife and livestock. Movement of wild rodents into human settlements has been commonly observed during harvest season; this may lead to the creation of favorable conditions for plague outbreaks (Kumar et al., 1997). Increased long-distance air travel could facilitate the movement of pathogens and vectors. The increasing popularity of ecotourism (Karanth et al., 2012) can further enhance the risk of wildlife related zoonoses. Additionally, factors such as poverty, lack of personal hygiene, defecating in open spaces, scarcity of potable water, abundance of stray animals, high population density, and certain culinary habits help many zoonotic parasites to readily complete their life cycles in India (Singh et al., 2010).",

Wild aquatic birds, such as geese, shorebirds and wild ducks are natural reservoirs of influenza A viruses (Sturm-Ramirez et al., 2005).

Known reservoirs for Nipah viruses are fruit bats (Pteropus spp.), which are distributed across the Indo-Pacific region from Madagascar eastward to the South Pacific islands (Epstein et al., 2006). Wildlife species such as bats could become key candidates for transfer of zoonotic pathogens as they have a long life span, live in large and dense populations in proximity to human populations, occur in colonies of mixed species, and have feeding habits that generate leftovers for other species. Rabies is exclusively a disease of terrestrial and airborne mammals, including dogs, wild canids and felids (wolves, foxes, coyotes, jackals, cats, bobcats, lions), skunks, badgers, bats, mongooses, monkeys and humans (Menezes, 2008). The possibility of spill-over of rabies virus from dogs to wildlife and vice versa is always present. There is evidence to indicate that natural infection with SARS-coronavirus may occur in a number of wild animal species indigenous to China and parts of south-east Asia (WHO, 2003).",

Nevertheless, a large number of mammals and birds are hunted, particularly in northeast India, and rural people are heavily dependent on wild meat (Hilaluddin et al., 2005). Yak's meat and milk are preferable over products of other animals because of their flavorful taste. Thus, the presence of reservoirs of sub-clinical brucellosis in Yak also poses a great threat to consumers, veterinary personnel, slaughter house workers and farmers (Bandyopadhay et al., 2009). The popularity of (widespread) hunting of waterfowl (Galliform birds) (Hilaluddin et al., 2005) represents a continuous risk of emergence or re-emergence of many important zoonotic pathogens such as avian influenza. Consumption of raw or undercooked wild boar meat has led to multiple outbreaks of trichinellosis in human beings (Sethi et al., 2012) and is a serious food safety risk. Exposure to dead rodents and other wildlife could be an important risk for exposure to many pathogens, including Toxoplasma gondii tissue cysts and Trichinella. The faeces of wild animals could also contaminate water, food and ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables with zoonotic pathogens such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, and Cryptosporidium, etc.",
