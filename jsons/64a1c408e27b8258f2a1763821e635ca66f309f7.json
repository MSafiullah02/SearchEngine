Nevertheless, the recent international situation has become increasingly complicated. Issues on the reemergence of trade protectionism and fall of petroleum prices could reduce the total trade surplus of the world economy, thereby shrinking the liquidity of the US dollar worldwide. Although the newly initiated quantitative easing by US Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic can serve as a tool to inject liquidity into the world capital market mainly through security investment, the real effect, which is determined by the nature of security capital, could be limited and volatile. Moreover, the international financial market could experience huge and frequent fluctuations. In a situation with increasing economic and political uncertainty, the capital account liberalization (CAL) strategy of emerging economies could change. As the largest trading country and holder of international reserves, CAL policy choices in China are essential and could generate demonstration effects for other emerging markets. The financial globalization can be influenced deeply and even reversed. Examining whether and how China can benefit from CAL is essential to evaluate the CAL policy orientation.",

Factors such as financial distortion could weaken and even destroy the availability of such benefit (Eichengreen and Leblang, 2003) . However, CAL can likewise be a source of economic instability and magnify distortions (Wei, 2018) . As the largest developing country in the world, China has adopted a positive attitude toward CAL following the RMB exchange rate reform. In recent years, the Chinese government has implemented various CAL policies to open the country's capital account progressively. The RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) program, which is a policy initiative allowing international investors holding an RQFII quota unprecedented access to Chinese onshore equity and fixed income securities markets, was announced by Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang We attempt to address the valuation effect of CAL by searching for evidence from the stock market. Specifically, we analyze the stock market response to the symbolic event, that is, the RQFII policy announcement, and use August 17, 2011 as the event date. Employing an event-study approach and a sample comprising Chinese listed firms, our empirical analysis yields several interesting findings. Overall, we find that the stock market responded significantly positively to the RQFII announcement. The positive cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) suggest that the CAL policy is beneficial on average. Next, we conduct regression analyses to examine the potential determinants of CARs, specifically, financing constraints. Our regression results indicate a certain level of heterogeneity that firms with more stringent financing constraints earn higher returns than their counterparts. We argue that this finding is because the market expects the RQFII announcement, as a CAL tool, to provide overseas financing opportunities for firms, especially those with financing constraints.",

We create a measure for quality of local institutions using the province-level marketization index, which is maintained by the National Economic Research Institute (NERI; Fan et al., 2003; Fan et al., 2011) , to gauge the extent of marketization. Moreover, we provide additional evidence that firms' return differentials are significantly high when firms are located in provinces with high-quality local institutions. In other words, firms with tight financing constraints gain from CAL when the quality of local institutions is high. This finding is because firms located in places with high-quality domestic institutions can allocate resources efficiently, thereby alleviating the twin agency problems (Stultz 2005).",

Specifically, Wei (2000) showed that countries with severe corruption systematically attract less foreign direct investment. Employing firm-level and cross-country data, Wei and Zhou (2018) found that weak public governance tends to reduce the share of external equity financing in total investments.

            "text": "Traditional international capital flow theory (Meade, 1952; Mundell, 1960) states that international capital flows from countries with relatively low interest rates to those with high interest rates. Capital generally flows from rich to poor countries (Lucas, 1990 ) and stimulates poor countries' economic growth or promotes their financial development. However, results are mixed when the relationship between the CAL policy and economic growth is considered. After analyzing financial crisis prevention and markets' response to capital control at the national and international levels, Summers (2000) recognized that controls on international capital flows tend to be ineffective, raise costs, and create distortions. Removing restrictions on capital flows and placing high priority on efficient capital markets should be a necessary step in the process of domestic and international capital liberalization for emerging countries. Henry (2000 Henry ( , 2003 demonstrated that the growth rate in output per worker rises by 2.3 percentage points, the rate of capital stock increases by 1.1 percentage points per year, and aggregate dividend yield falls by 240 basic points when emerging economies open their stock markets to foreign investors. By contrast, CAL increases competition in the domestic financial sector and is deemed detrimental to local banks in poor countries (Claessens and Huizinga, 2001) . However, current research on CAL and economic growth is mainly from the macro perspective. In our study, we use firm-level financing constraints to measure the degree of micro-level capital shortages and employ the stock market response to reflect the expectation of firms utilizing overseas funds from the CAL policy. Thus, we present the following hypothesis.",

A large WW index value indicates that firms face high financing constraints. Hadlock and Pierce (2010) focused on firm size and age and developed a linear and quadratic term function for the two variables (hereafter referred to as the SA index). The larger the SA index value, the less tight the financing constraints of a firm. 2 Several single variables can also be used as financing constraint proxies, such as firm size (Sheridan and Roberto, 1988; Fama, 1990 ) and age (Hadlock and Pierce, 2010) .

We follow Ding et al. (2018) and construct a measure of political connectedness at the firm level. By manually tracking their curriculum vitae, we can identify whether a TMT or board member holds a secretarial position in the party committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Party membership can entail political connections that help firms relax production process constraints and positively affect firms' profitability (Li et al., 2008) . If a TMT or board member is currently (or previously) a secretary of the CPC, then he/she is identified as a politically connected member. We take the number of politically connected firm members as the value of the firm's financing constraints (hereafter referred to as the Political_connection variable).",

Next, we calculate CARs over an 11-day (-5, 5) event window centered on the announcement date (i.e., August 17, 2011) and test their statistical significance. Table 3 reports the average of the CARs, which is positive and significantly different from zero. This finding indicates that the market gained 1.69% on average during the 11-day event window. In addition, we illustrate the ratio of firms with positive CARs to the total number of firms. We find that 749 of 1,206 firms experience an increase in their abnormal return during the 11-day event window. To establish robustness in our findings, we consider different market benchmarks and alternative event windows. However, our findings remain unaltered.

Using an event-study approach, we provide evidence that the stock market responded positively to the CAL policy. Specifically, the CAL policy announcement return is positively related to firms with increased stringent financing constraints. This finding implies that CAL can help alleviate financial distortion and proves the idea of \"using liberalization to push reform\" in CAL, which is a general principle of the China economic opening up policy. Moreover, this study finds that local institutions matter, which indicates that accelerating the marketization process may be effective in enhancing the effect of the CAL policy. It has important policy significance for the local government and is valuable for firms' site selection for investment. Note: *, **, and *** denote 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively.
