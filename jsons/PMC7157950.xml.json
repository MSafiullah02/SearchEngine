Unrelated to its attributes as antibiotic, dapsone has been used for over 20 years to treat a variety of neutrophilic dermatoses (dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid, et al) and rheumatoid arthritis. In the neutrophilic dermatoses dapsone works by inhibiting IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis leading ameliorating disease without effect on the underlying pathology. These observations lead to the conclusion that dapsone might ameliorate ARDS-related lung tissue destruction and improve outcomes by reducing neutrophils\u2019 contributions without having effect on the underlying disease that triggered the ARDS.",

Diffuse alveolar damage is one of the characteristic, defining features of the acute phase of ARDS. Diffuse alveolar damage is characterized by edema, hyaline deposition, and dense leukocyte infiltration. Over days this is followed by an organizing phase, with septal fibrosis and pneumocyte hyperplasia.3,4 The clinical consequences of this series of events are hypoxemia and multiorgan failure with a high death rate.",
