SARS largely died out during the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2003 when the virus became significantly less infectious. However, while the COVID\u201019 virus appears to be considerably less lethal than SARS, which had a fatality rate of 9.6%, killing 774 of the 8,098 reported patients 1, it is more infectious. And though the virus was very quickly identified and its genome sequenced, it does not automatically translate into detailed information about infectivity, virulence and how it interacts with the human immune system.",

This hypothesis arose after a cluster of cases was reported in Germany, appearing to have originated from an individual who had flown in from China but did not report symptoms until after returning to China. However, as was pointed out by Amesh Adalja, Senior Scholar at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, it was then established that the person had indeed experienced symptoms in Germany before they were reported by other people in that cluster.",

It means some cases will go undetected because the symptoms are so mild that coronavirus infection is not suspected, at least initially. As Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, pointed out early on, the wide range of severity in symptoms is one of the major challenges: the cases of patients with only very mild symptoms, or people who are asymptomatic, may be masking the true numbers infected and the extent of person\u2010to\u2010person transmission.",

This has the corollary that warm countries are much less affected; Hunter noted there was only one single case of SARS in the whole of Africa and that was South Africa where there are seasonal variations in temperature. However, he also cautioned against complacency, noting that Mexico experienced quite a high number of cases during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, despite the country being hot except at higher altitudes inland. \u201cSo there are other factors determining infectivity beyond temperature\u201d, Hunter added.",

As a result, the degree of severity has been exaggerated by the data so far: while almost all the extreme and fatal cases have been notified, there has been considerable underreporting of mild cases. Early data on closed cases, that is people who had either died or recovered, indicated a fatality rate as high as 20%. At time of writing, however, the death rate among more recent cases had subsided to about 1.5% with the highest risk for the elderly.",

It also reflects the common decline of virulence during such epidemics, partly resulting from strong selective pressure imposed by social distancing, quarantine and other public health measures 2. These measures reduce the rate of transmission and slow down progression of the outbreak, giving the virus more time to attenuate. Social distancing amplifies selection for longer\u2010surviving low\u2010virulence sub\u2010groups, so that the majority of the population during the later stages of an outbreak are exposed to less virulent phenotypes 2.",

That was indeed the case even for the great Spanish Influenza Pandemic 1918/19, which caused a much larger proportion of severe cases and deaths among younger people than most other flu outbreaks. \u201cThat was when Spanish flu was in its first flush, not after it had become endemic\u201d, Hunter explained.",

They communicated that information transparently, completely, honestly and instantaneously to the world's scientific community. That meant three things happens immediately. Firstly countries around the world, including our own CDC (Centres for Disease Control), quickly ran their own PCR tests in their own laboratories and so were able to implement testing very promptly. Number two, within hours of transmission of that genomic information, people began working on a vaccine.

That public health information and the clinical information is only just now being shared.

[\u2026] We are not sure how reliable that is.\u201d Schaffner therefore suggested that the rest of the world would be unable to rely on that metric. \u201cThere may though be one other metric that can help us and that is the number of exportations from Wuhan and Hubei (the other area district at the epicentre of the outbreak) to other parts of China and the rest of the world\u201d, he added. \u201cIf you can show a diminution in those exportations that will give public health and governments generally the confidence they can back off some of these quarantine restrictions\u201d.",

This applies particularly to vaccines and antibodies to neutralize the active sites of the virus surface that expedite the penetration of host cells, according to Michael Farzan, Co\u2010chair of the Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Scripps Research, La Jolla, CA, USA. \u201cThis virus is a close cousin of SARS\u2010CoV, and like SARS\u2010CoV, it \u2018chooses\u2019, meaning has been selected, to move rapidly from host to host before an adaptive immune response emerges\u201d, he explained. \u201cBecause of this, and unlike HIV\u20101 and Ebolavirus, it keeps its key epitopes exposed, probably so that it can be more efficient at binding the next cell. This makes it very vulnerable to antibody neutralization, and thus it is a relatively easy virus to protect against. I refer to it as \u2018stupid\u2019 on a spectrum where HIV, which lives in the face of an active immune system for years, is a \u2018genius\u2019\u201d.",

Death usually results from respiratory failure following pneumonia, which is either caused directly by the virus or caused by secondary infection by opportunistic bacteria, such as Streptococcus. In the case of influenza outbreaks, pneumonia usually results from secondary bacterial infections that come in only when the primary virus infection has subsided. Indeed, the majority of deaths associated with the great Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918\u20131919 were caused not by the influenza virus alone, but by bacterial pneumonia following the initial viral infection 4.",

Also, the early symptoms of this novel coronavirus infection are in the lower respiratory tract\u201d.

Again, there is a lack of clinical as well as epidemiological data that are coming out\u201d, Edmunds commented.
