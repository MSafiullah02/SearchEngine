An understanding of the nature of these interactions provides insight into metabolic processes and critical regulatory events of the host cell as well as into the mechanisms of pathogenesis by infectious microorganisms. Pathogen exposure induces changes in host proteins at many functional levels including cell signaling pathways, protein degradation, cytokines and growth factor production, phagocytosis, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Since proteins are responsible for the cell biological functions, pathogens have evolved to manipulate the host cell proteome to achieve optimal replication. Intracellular pathogens can also change their proteome to adapt to the host cell and escape from immune surveillance, or can incorporate cellular proteins to invade other cells. Given that the interactions of intracellular infectious agents with host cells are mainly at the protein level, proteomics is the most suitable tool for investigating these interactions. Proteomics is the systematic analysis of proteins, particularly their interactions, modifications, localization and functions, that permits the study of the association between pathogens with their host cells as well as complex interactions such as the host-vectorpathogen interplay. A review on the most relevant proteomic applications used in the study of host-pathogen interactions is presented.",

In the first scenario, the pathogen must adapt at multiple levels to infect a target cell: entry via specific receptors or endocytic mechanisms, generation of copies of its own genome, expression of parasite proteins, and protein assembly to produce an infectious progeny. In the second scenario, the pathogen must escape from the immune response, both the natural immunity mechanisms-interferon (IFN), phagocytosis, natural killer (NK)",

            "text": "Intracellular parasites, especially viruses, have extraordinarily compact genomes which do not encode all necessary functions for a complete infectious life cycle. For this reason, parasite adaptation to the host cell requires the use of numerous cellular factors so as to generate an infectious progeny [2, 3] . Apart from recruiting specific factors for the different phases of the infectious cycle, intracellular parasites must control the biochemical machinery of the cell to replicate their genome and generate their own proteins. This control of the cellular machinery takes places at different levels [4] . For example, different families of viruses such as Rhabdovirus, Poxvirus, Paramixovirus, and Reovirus inhibit gene transcription through interference with RNA polymerases or transcription factors. On the contrary, regulatory proteins of lymphotropic viruses such as Tax from human Tcell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), EBNA1 from Epstein-Barr, and Tat from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) act through transcription of cellular genes. Many other viruses inhibit host protein synthesis while viral protein production is maintained [5] . These shut-off mechanisms include inactivation of translation factors, degradation of host cell mRNAs, or production of factors that specifically inhibit host protein synthesis or induce translation of viral mRNAs. All these mechanisms of interference consequently lead to the detriment of metabolic routes necessary for cell life. Consequently, the infection alters basic cell functions such as cell structure and viability, which leads in most productive infections to cell death via apoptosis [6] . Moreover, intracellular parasites can turn the cell machinery to their own advantage through modification of the cell proteome. The final goal of this process is to allow replication of the parasite despite the strong toxicity. As an example, HIV-1 infection induces the cellular transcription factor nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), which is not only an essential regulatory element for the virus, but also protects cells from apoptosis, thereby leading to both HIV-1 replication and prolonged cell survival [6, 7] (Fig. 1 ).",

            "text": "There are three different levels of immune response against parasites: innate intracellular immunity, natural immunity, and specific HLA-mediated immune response. The innate intracellular immunity compiles warning mechanisms against microbial infections that include non-specific systems, such as endocytosis and parasite degradation in lysosomes, and specific mechanisms such as RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) or restriction factors of retroviral infections (e.g., TRIM5a, APOBEC3G) [8] . However, many microorganisms have generated strategies to escape from non-specific mechanisms: e.g., both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae are resistant to acidic pH in lysosomes; and Francisella tularensis can translocate from the phagosome and replicate in the cytosol. Moreover, pathogens can also escape from specific immune mechanisms. For example, the IFN-induced double-stranded PKR is a mammalian serinethreonine kinase that phosphorylates the eIF2alpha translation initiation factor in response to stress signals, mainly as a result of viral infections. eIF2alpha phosphorylation results in arrest of translation of both cellular and viral mRNAs, which is an efficient way to inhibit virus replication. As a consequence, several viruses have evolved to express PKR inhibitors, such as the vaccinia E3L and K3L proteins [9] . Other cellular factors such as TRIM5a or APOBEC3G restrict replication of retrovirus through interference in the uncoating process or inhibition of viral infectivity [10, 11] . Natural immunity represents a powerful mechanism of antimicrobial defense that pre-exists or is rapidly induced in the absence of previous contact with the infectious agent. Soluble elements such as complement, IFN, or inflammatory mediators (cytokines and chemokines) together with cell HIV-1 life cycle as an example of host-pathogen interaction. An intracellular pathogen is not only able to use the host proteins to replicate, but it can also incorporate cellular proteins in its structure to increase the spread or infectivity on adjacent cell hosts. effectors, particularly macrophages and NK, can control or delay the replication and propagation of the pathogen. In the latter situation, natural immunity can provide enough time for the development of specific immune responses. However, parasites have also developed mechanisms to escape control of natural immunity. For example, large DNA viruses and parasites such as Schistosoma mansoni produce homologues of cytokines, chemokines, as well as their receptors, which are secreted to the medium and protect the infected cell from the action of inflammatory mediators [12] . Besides, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and HIV-1 escape from NK-mediated surveillance by down-regulating the expression of NKG2D ligands in infected cells [13] .",

However, intracellular parasites, particularly viruses, have also developed multiple mechanisms to escape from this specific response [15] . MHC down-regulation is triggered by different viral families such as herpes, adenovirus, poxvirus, and retrovirus. Both epitope mutation and generation of a latent state in the infected cells are common mechanisms to escape from immune surveillance and make their eradication by the immune system extremely difficult [16] .",

Since ESI is ideally suited for on-line coupling to HPLC, this is the MS technique of choice in this approach, commonly referred to as multidimensional protein identification technology (Mud-PIT) [32] . MudPIT enables rapid identification of proteins that interact with tagged bait while bypassing some of the problems associated with analysis of polypeptides excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. It is based on the coupling of multidimensional chromatography and MS/MS. Using this methodology is possible to identify complex protein mixtures generated from biofluids, tissues, cells, organelles, or protein complexes. MudPIT has been employed for the identification of some interesting proteomes or subproteomes from pathogenic microorganisms [32] [33] [34] [35] . In contrast to gel-based methods, MudPIT is not limited by the starting protein amount or the detection range, but by the complexity of the peptide mixture, which in turn leads to a decreased probability of identifying peptide from the less abundant proteins. The large number of data generated by these proteomics approaches has been combined with known biological networks to construct computer-aided models of the cellular processes of normal and diseased cell functions (network proteomics). This is an emerging area of the large-scale approaches (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to make sense of the analysis of differential expression experiments, by interconnecting expression-responsive genes, such as a catalogue of identified proteins through proteomic techniques, with protein interaction databases [36] . These tools could also be applied for the study of infectious diseases and host-pathogen interactions, for example, as has been described by Mawuenyega et al. [37] . A combination of this strategy with the subcellular protein profiling of M. tuberculosis has permitted the identification of proteins whose involvement in the reconstructed response networks for fatty acid degradation and lipid biosynthesis pathways were not previously suspected, thereby providing interesting insights into the compartmentalization of these pathways as well as its role.",

This approach represents a great advantage for identification of protein interactors that may reveal new functions or represent regulators of transcriptional factors. It implies the selection of specific antibodies against a target protein for the first immunoprecipitation. The result of this step is the semipurification of the target protein and its bound partners. Subsequent steps include protein separation by SDS-PAGE and the transfer to an NC membrane. Finally, the membrane is revealed by immunoblotting using a limited set of selected antibodies against the putative interacting proteins. This limited method can now be combined with MS/MS to improve the identification results. This modification is based on the possibility of analyzing the immunoprecipitated pool of proteins by LC-MS. Either the eluted proteins or the solid immunoprecipitation support to which the retained proteins are attached must be previously digested in solution with trypsin. An interesting variation is the association of the tandem affinity purification (TAP) method and MudPIT. TAP allows rapid purification under native conditions of complexes by incubating the protein extract of interest with the target protein fused to the TAP tag, either N-or C-terminally.

In this approach, protein extracts (e.g., infected and control) are labeled with different fluorescent dyes, then combined and separated by 2-DE, and the corresponding gel images are obtained using the appropriate excitation wavelengths. These images are then merged and processed by dedicated image analysis software to reveal differences between them corresponding to differential protein expression between protein samples.

These effects may be exerted immediately after the binding of the pathogen to the receptor on the cell surface, either by a new protein encoded by modifying the activity of a cellular protein, or by a microbial protein mimicking a cellular protein.

Apoptosis plays a critical role in inhibiting the proliferation of invasive organisms and viruses, thereby protecting uninfected cells and limiting damage to the host organism. Apoptosis is a complex mechanism that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of several intracellular pathogens. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of the host response to microbial infection, particularly anti-apoptotic responses, is essential for identifying targets to prevent disease and tissue damage resulting from the inflammatory response. Chlamydia is a classical example of obligate intracellular bacteria. It causes eye infection, sexually transmitted diseases, and respiratory infections, depending on the species [51, 52] . During this cycle, Chlamydia alternates between an infectious extracellular pathogen and an intracellular dividing form surrounded by phagosome membrane termed inclusion [53] . Proteins secreted from the inclusion may interact with host cell proteins and modify the host cell response to infection. The identification of these proteins is difficult because the host cell cytoplasm of Chlamydia-infected cells cannot be purified. However, this problem has been solved by using comparative proteomics [53] . As a result, it was determined that Chlamydia either promotes or inhibits apoptosis of the infected host cell during intracellular development [54] . In fact, there are anti-apoptotic mechanisms that take place during the early stage of the development cycle as part of its intracellular survival strategy [55] [56] [57] .",

In fact, reactive oxygen species generation and changes in the control of mitochondrial membrane potential have also been involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) pathogenesis, as ATP synthase and cytochrome c oxidase were differentially up-regulated in cells that express the SARS CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro) [70] . This protease plays an essential role in virus replication as it mediates the proteolytic processing of the viral replicase. In human promonocyte cells, 3CLpro has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis via caspase-3 and caspase-9 [71] . A comparative proteome analysis of human promonocyte cells expressing or not expressing 3CLpro, performed by 2-DE and nano-LC/ESI-quadrupole-TOF MS, showed that viral protease expression results in alteration of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway [70] . This pathway plays a central role in several cellular processes including antigen processing, apoptosis, cell cycle, inflammation, and response to stress [72] and its up-regulation might be involved in SARS pathogenesis. Consequently, both ubiquitin protein degradation and modification have also been shown to be essential for the host immune response to pathogens [60] .",

In addition, the actin cytoskeleton system is crucial for active recruitment in cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages that rapidly have to move to the infection and inflammation sites [74] . For example, comparing protein profiles of gastric epithelial cells infected or not infected with Helicobacter pylori by using 2-DE and PMF reflects that infected cells up-regulated tropomodulin 3 (TMOD3) [75] , a protein involved in negative regulation of pointed-end disassembly and turnover of free barbed ends of actin [76] as well as in focal adhesion complex signaling and remodeling [77] . Consequently, TMOD3 up-regulation may exert an influence on H. pylori inducing actin cytoskeletal rearrangements associated with cell elongation [78] [79] [80] . Moreover, H. pylori induces cell motility, which is a key element in tumor progression. Another example is Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive bacterium that causes the disease listeriosis. The primary site of infection is the intestinal epithelium where the bacteria invade non-phagocytic cells. After uptake, this bacterium is able to rupture endocytic vesicles in order to replicate within the cytosol of host cells [81] . Moreover, Listeria can move within eukaryotic cells by driving polymerization of actin filaments and, therefore, it can infect adjacent cells without exposing to the extracellular environment [82] . This ability is mainly due to the surface protein ActA, which can promote actin polymerization at the bacterial cell surface [83] . Therefore, this unique protein makes it possible that Listeria has the driving force required for intracellular movement.",

These proteins have a vital role in the complex immunological interaction that occurs between T lymphocytes and other cells of the host organism.

The polypeptides may have originated from a protein created by the organism itself, or they may have originated from bacteria, viruses, protozoans, etc. The MHC-TCR interaction allows that T cells ignore self peptides while reacting appropriately to the foreign peptides. Some intracellular pathogens are able to internalize these molecules, thereby blocking the host cell communication with other cells.",

This may explain why infected cells remained invisible to CD 8 1 T cells. However, the dramatic trafficking inhibition imposed by CVB3 3A protein by disrupting the Golgi apparatus is incomplete, and there may exist a cycling of pre-existing MHC class I molecules to and from the infected cell surface because the overall levels of cellular protein synthesis are not affected [100, 101] . An increased internalization of MHC class I molecules has been also observed in HIV-1infected cells [102] . In particular, the regulatory protein Nef down-regulates the cell-surface expression of MHC class I proteins by inducing endocytosis re-localized to the trans-Golgi network [103] , thereby promoting immune evasion. The mechanisms implicated in MHC endocytosis have not yet been completely elucidated, but are known to require the binding of Nef to phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 (PACS-1) [102] , which enables the formation of transport vesicles from membranes and controls the endosome-to-Golgi trafficking of specific proteins [104, 105] .",

            "text": "Many pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to imitate host proteins and to hijack the intracellular signal transduction systems for their own benefit [81] . In fact, the binding of pathogens to target cells is known to be mediated by several intracellular signaling events. For example, HIV-1 binding to a target cell induces changes such as phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and activation of MAPK [106, 107] . This process has a role in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription and virion production [108, 109] . Therefore, these virus-mediated signal transduction events might be partly due to the additional interactions between host-encoded glycoproteins on virions and their physiological counter-receptors on the target cell surface [110] . Besides, virion-associated host MHC class II glycoproteins could initiate a wide array of different cellular responses ranging from activation, anergy, and apoptosis through interaction with the TCR/CD3 complex located on the target cell [110] . Furthermore, the majority of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins modified during replication are involved in vesicular transport, protein trafficking, and cell signaling, as was assessed by DIGE coupled to MS and by SILAC combined with SDS-PAGE separation and MS [111] . Differential protein expression in HCV-replicating cells was largely concordant with both proteomics approaches. Up-regulation of several Rab GTPases, proteins involved in vesicular transport by facilitating fusion between membrane compartments, was found [112] . This might reflect a complex modulation of vesicle formation and traffic driven by HCV. Finally, downregulation of proteins belonging to the Rho family of small GTPases (e.g., Cdc42) might be responsible for increasing HCV replication. In fact, it has been shown that Cdc42 stimulates the PI3K pathway as well as the molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR), a member of the phosphoinositide 3kinase related kinase (PIKK) family and a central modulator of cell growth, which in turn constrains HCV replication [113, 114] .",

Results indicated that most of the novel proteins found are involved in intermediary metabolism, such as enzymes required in fatty acid b-oxidation. This finding reinforces the idea that Mycobacterium receives most of its energy from the degradation of host-derived lipids [116] . Besides, it has been suggested that the HCV core protein plays a crucial role in liver pathogenesis by affecting lipid metabolism [117] . A comparative proteomic analysis of lipid droplet proteins in core-expressing and non-expressing hepatoma cell lines, based on SDS-PAGE and MALDI-MS or direct nano-LC-MS, has revealed that core proteins participate in lipid droplet biogenesis by reducing adipose differentiation-related protein through a highly increased tailinteracting protein of 47 kDa (TIP47) [118] .",

Analysis of the modification in the S. pneumoniae proteome caused by blood has been performed using a combination of highly sensitive 2-DE and MALDI-MS and/or LC-MS [133] . It was determined that S. pneumoniae altered its metabolism when exposed to blood as an adaptation to its host. Besides, analysis of the switch in protein expression by S. pneumoniae at the transition from log growth phase to stationary phase has revealed protein species involved in central intermediary metabolism, amino acid synthesis, nucleotide and fatty acid metabolism, cell wall synthesis, protein degradation, and stress responses, suggesting previously unrecognized relationships between proteins along the life cycle of this pathogen [134] . The heat shock response of S. pneumoniae at the protein level has been addressed by comparing protein expression patterns at 377C and 427C. This study revealed several factors amenable to play a role in the physiopathology of this pathogen [135] .",

Thus, it is known that some proteins of intracellular pathogens need the interaction with other host-cell proteins to be modified. This is the case of PTMs in some proteins from bacteria and viruses, which are mediated by the cellular protein machinery. Such modifications are generally reversible and play key roles in protein functional regulation. Among many reported types of PTMs, phosphorylation in serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues has received significant attention, since this reversible modification is a key event in signaling processes [136] . Antibodies directed toward phosphorylated residues have been used to enrich protein extracts for phosphoproteins by immunoprecipitation [137] . IMAC allows enrichment of phosphopeptides in more large-scale studies [138] . Phosphorylation is also common in virus proteins implicated in the control of virus replication, transcription, and assembly. This is the case for Rubella virus capsid protein [139] , influenza virus nucleoprotein [140] , and Rabies virus nucleoprotein [141] . Therefore, great effort has been directed towards developing methods for detecting and characterizing these modifications. However, identification of phosphorylated residues was a difficult task, involving direct labeling of proteins with 32 P [142] . ESI is one of the softest ionization techniques for MS [20] , which allows the detection and characterization of numerous PTMs, as direct sequence information is obtained. Highly complex protein mixtures can be identified directly, and the possible PTM characterized by MS [32] . For example, MudPIT coupled to MS has been used to study the nucleocapsid protein phosphorylation of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in infected cells [143] , which led to the identification of at least four phosphorylations in the TGEV nucleocapsid protein. Interestingly, previous work had suggested that phosphorylation/ dephosphorylation processes could play an important role in coronavirus assembly [144] .",

Killing dispersed spores effectively has proven difficult and it would be beneficial, therefore, to be able to selectively inactivate B. anthracis spores. This could be achieved by finding components unique to these spores which are critical for resistance and targeting them. For this purpose, the exosporium of B. anthracis has been characterized by electrophoresis and peptide mapping [153] . Several spore coat proteins were identified that are targets for functional studies. Huang et al.

These proteins are targets for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic agents against anthrax.

M. tuberculosis is a globally successful pathogen due to its ability to persist for long periods of time unrecognized by the human immune system. The panoply of genes that allows the organism to enter latency and then re-emerge later during endogenous re-infection are now being elucidated [156] . Proteomic studies aimed at deciphering the molecular basis of latency in tuberculosis started with the work of Starck et al. [157] on the cytosolic proteome of M. tuberculosis under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Several proteins related to the latent phase were identified and it was estimated that this pathogen induces expression of ca. 1% of its genes in response to latency. A study on the challenging membrane proteome of M. tuberculosis has been carried out that revealed a number of proteins potentially associated with immunogenicity [158] . Proteins specific to the intraphagosomal phase of the pathogen have been determined by matching protein patterns of intraphagosomally grown M. tuberculosis against those of broth-cultured mycobacteria, albeit the role of these proteins as factors enabling intracellular survival of the pathogen is under discussion [159] .",

Although the majority of host cellsurface proteins are excluded when enveloped viruses are released by budding through cell membranes, the incorporation of host proteins into the nascent virion is a common phenomenon. This is because the host cellular machinery is actively participating during assembly of the newly formed viral entity. For example, the avian myeloblastosis virus acquires membrane ATPase [160] ; H-2 antigens are incorporated by murine leukemia virus and Friend virus particles [161, 162] ; HLA-A and -B antigens are embedded in the envelope of feline leukemia virus [163] ; cellular histones, Thy-1, and receptors from human interleukin 2 (IL-2) are incorporated in simian virus 40 (SV-40), murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and HTLV-1, respectively [164] [165] [166] ; complement control proteins such as decay-accelerating factor (CD55) and the membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD59) are also associated with HTLV-1 and HCMV [167] ; human CD4 is assembled into avian leucosis virus (AVL) particles [168] ; MHC class II molecules are present on the surface of Epstein-Barr virus [169] and both class I and II proteins are associated with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) [163] and Friend virus [162] ; host-encoded annexin II and protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A are associated with HCMV [170, 171] . Acquisition of host cellular constituents is also a property of HIV-1. The proteome from this retrovirus has been exhaustively analyzed and most of the main proteins incorporated from the host cells are already known. HIV-1 can incorporate a vast array of host proteins while budding out of infected cells [110] . Furthermore, viral envelope protein was shown to represent less than 0.1% of the total protein, whereas the virion-bound MHC class II DR molecule (HLA-DR), which is incorporated into the envelope of HIV-1 as it buds from the host cell plasma membrane, accounted for 20% of the total protein [172, 173] . In addition, more than 20 different host-cell derived proteins have been identified in the HIV-1 envelope. On the other hand, cytoskeletal host proteins [174] and proteins with co-stimulatory effects [175] [176] [177] [178] or enzymatic properties [179, 180] have been also found inside the virions. An example of the application of proteomics technology for such studies is the analysis of cyclophilin A associated with HIV-1 virions by using 2-DE and MALDI-MS [181] .",

            "text": "The biological significance of the incorporation of hostderived molecules in viruses is important in determining their effects on the pathogen cell cycle. Moreover, pathogenassociated host cell proteins are most likely functional and could play a role in pathogenesis. In fact, a contribution of virally acquired host cell proteins in virus infectivity has been suggested [110] . For example, many acquired cellular proteins retain their biological function in HIV-1 particles: CD44 on the virion has been shown to bind hyaluronic acid [182] ; CD55 or CD59 can provide resistance to complement-mediated lysis [183, 184] ; CD86 has been related to activation of the HIV-1 promoter region in human T cells and engagement of the TCR [177] ; and antibodies to lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), ICAM-2, ICAM-3, and MHC classes I and II have been shown to affect the infectivity of HIV-1 in vitro, suggesting that these cellular molecules are involved in virus-cell interactions [185] . ICAM-1 has also been reported to be involved in HIV-1 mediated syncytium formation [186] as well as in a faster and extensive depletion of CD4 1 T cells, considered as the major reservoir of HIV-1 [187] . ICAM-1 also renders HIV-1 particles less susceptible to antibodymediated neutralization [188] . On the other hand, when HLA-DR is incorporated in HIV-1 it increases the process of virus attachment to target cells and enhances HIV-1 activity [189] [190] [191] . HLA-DR also renders HIV-1 more refractory to neutralization by mAbs directed against Env proteins [188, 192] . All these results suggest that virion-bound cellular constituents might accelerate the kinetics of virus entry, most likely by interacting with their corresponding counterreceptors displayed on the target cells, and thus act as additional ligands for virus attachment [110] . As a consequence, incorporation of some specific host molecules into nascent virions modifies the intrinsic properties of HIV-1 and it might play a role in the HIV-1-mediated immune dysfunctions [188, [190] [191] [192] .",

Moreover, the incorporation of HLA-DR by HIV-1 in vivo may correlate with the state of immunological activation of the cell supporting viral replication [173] .

In contrast to transcriptome analyses, which allow the quantification of gene expression in a global manner, quantitative and qualitative differences of a given protein can be monitored in different situations using proteome techniques.
