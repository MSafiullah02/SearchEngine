Cardiovascular complications are known to occur in patients with COVID-19. We present herein a patient with concomitant acute thrombosis of the abdominal aorta and pulmonary embolism, illustrating the hypercoagulable state associated with the disease.",

Computed tomography (CT) examination of the chest performed one hour after admission showed typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia ( Fig. 1 ), later confirmed with real-time polymerase chain reaction test. The patient was admitted and oxygen treatment initiated. On hospital day (HD) 3, oxygen requirements increased. Blood test showed serum Ddimer level of 17280 ng/mL (Normal < 250 ng/mL), prothrombin time of 16 sec and platelets count of 361 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Venous Doppler ultrasound revealed thrombosis of right posterior tibial vein. Pulmonary CT angiography confirmed acute pulmonary embolism. As a filling defect was observed within the aorta, additional aortic CT angiography was performed and showed a free-floating thrombus without aortic atherosclerosis. There were no evidences of visceral, hepatic, splenic or renal embolisms on venous phase images. The 12-lead electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. There was no clinical evidence of acute limb ischemia. Enoxaparin anticoagulation therapy was started with favorable outcome.",

            "text": "Abnormal coagulation parameters, such as elevated D-dimers, have been described and seem to be associated with a higher risk of development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with COVID-19 [1] . As in other viral pneumonias, patients with COVID-19 may be at risk of acute pulmonary embolism; however, the prevalence of this association is yet to be determined. This observation is to our knowledge the first to report an acute arterial thrombosis related to COVID-19. This complication may reflect the potential hypercoagulability associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and raises the question of using early markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation, particularly D-dimer levels, to guide therapy [2] .
