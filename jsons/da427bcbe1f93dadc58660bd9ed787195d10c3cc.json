            "text": "T HE passage of blood through the pulmonary blood vessels as well as the periodic changes of the blood volume and the distension of the vessel walls associated with heart action are, besides the ventilation-related air volume changes, one of the major causes of the in vivo variation of electrical properties of lung tissue with time [1] . The electrical properties of biological tissues can be determined by the technique of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with a very good time resolution. EIT generates two-dimensional images of the distribution of electrical impedance within a studied body section at rates approaching a few tens of EIT images/s. Until now, the imaging of lung ventilation has dominated the chest applications of EIT [2] , nevertheless, a few examinations aiming at imaging pulmonary perfusion have been performed as well [1] , [3] - [6] . The most probable future use of EIT in imaging lung perfusion is the detection of perfusion defects in pulmonary embolism [7] . Acute lung embolism is a life-threatening disease which requires prompt initiation of, e.g., anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapy. However, in a large group of patients (e.g., the postoperative ones), this therapy may be associated with severe side effects because of increased bleeding risk. So as not to unnecessarily postpone the onset of the possibly life-saving therapy, a rapid and certain diagnosis of pulmonary embolism using a method with high sensitivity and specificity would be desirable.",

This device has previously been used in a study on healthy humans during parabolic flights [12] . In the present experiments, 16 X-ray transparent electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes (Blue Sensor BR-50-K, Medicotest A/S, \u00d8lstykke, Denmark) were placed around the boundary of a transverse thoracic plane lying approximately 1 cm below the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter. (The proper location of the electrodes was established on the basis of a previously acquired planar EBCT chest image.) The array of surface electrodes was needed by the EIT technique for the rotating injection of small alternating electrical currents (5 , 50 kHz) and the measurement of resulting potential differences. The injection of the excitation currents was consecutively performed through all 16 adjacent electrode pairs. Each current application was followed by the voltage measurements between all adjacent electrodes except the driving ones. One complete cycle of current injections and voltage measurements was completed within 77 ms. A total of 1000 consecutive measuring cycles were performed during an individual EIT measurement, i.e., the duration of one measurement was 77 s.",

            "text": "A total of three animals were studied by EIT during different steady-state experimental conditions. Normal lung circulation and simulated occlusion of a pulmonary artery branch were followed during breath-holding utilizing the principle of the indicator dilution technique. Additional measurements were performed during undisturbed mechanical ventilation. The EIT findings were compared with the reference EBCT measurements. Figs. 1-3 show the local time-impedance and time-density curves obtained in the studied animals during three different types of bolus administration of the nonradiographic and radiographic contrast agents, respectively. (For better comparison with the EBCT curves obtained during a brief data acquisition period, only the first 40 s of the EIT measurements are shown.) The curves shown were generated from the EIT and EBCT data at two pixel locations in the right and left lung. One pixel was situated in a lung region supplied by the vessel in which the catheter tip was located, the other one was in the contralateral lung at the same vertical height as the first one. In all animals, an ipsilateral fall of electrical impedance was observed during injection of the saline solution through the distal opening of the catheter whereas no such impedance change was detected in the contralateral lung. During administration through the proximal opening with the catheter balloon being inflated, the bolus did not arrive in the lung periphery supplied by the blocked vessel and the fall in regional electrical impedance was found on the opposite side than during the first type of bolus administration. When the balloon was deflated and bolus injected through the proximal opening, regional electrical impedance decreased in both lungs. The time-density curves obtained from the EBCT data exhibited essentially the same characteristics as the EIT findings.",

Not only are the electrical impedance changes associated with lung perfusion small but they are also masked and modulated by the much larger changes related to lung ventilation. In most of the EIT studies aimed at assessing lung perfusion, the ECG-triggered data acquisition was used for the period of 100-200 cardiac cycles and the effect of ventilation was minimized by averaging [1] , [3] , [6] . The impedance changes occurring synchronously with the heart rate, usually termed as \"perfusion-related impedance changes,\" can also be separated from the ventilation-related ones by digital filtering [4] , [5] . The other approach used to minimize the ventilation component of the impedance signal, used in the present experiments as well, is to acquire the EIT data during breath-holding.",

Moreover, the complex origin of the acquired impedance data does not allow to separate the true perfusion from other components contributing to the cardiac synchronous impedance changes. The use of an intravascular contrast material, which in the case of EIT perfusion imaging means an agent with either higher or lower conductivity than blood, could provide a large impedance signal related directly to pulmonary blood flow. Previous in vitro experiments have shown that EIT can follow the passage of an isotonic saline solution bolus through a tube placed in a tank filled with a solution with conductivity comparable to blood [16] . It was even demonstrated that the saline passage can be detected in the upper arm veins and in the cardiac region in one subject. Based on this approach, we have used the hypertonic saline solution applied as a contrast agent to follow local pulmonary perfusion in our experiments.",

However, the ability of EIT to follow the transit of a bolus through the pulmonary vascular system in terms of local time-impedance curves indicates that quantitative analysis of EIT data based on the indicator dilution principle may be attempted in the future. The calculation of the area under the time-impedance dilution curve which is inversely proportional with the flux as well as of other specific curve parameters like appearance time, appearance-to-peak time and mean transit time should be possible. Because EIT is able to produce images of lung ventilation [2] , the present findings also indicate that multifunctional imaging of the lung function by EIT comparable with the isotope ventilation/perfusion scans may be aspired in the future. Functional EIT images have a similar resolution than the scintigraphic scans, however, their advantage is that they can be obtained at the bedside at low cost and without the use of radioactive tracers. At present it is too early to define the exact clinical perspective of EIT in this new indication with certainty.",
