In Italy, after the shutdown of the educational system (schools and Universities will remain closed at least for one month) and the collapse of the touristic sector (90% of travels and reservations cancelled), the Government officially locked down residents of all the region of Milan (Lombardia) and other 11 provinces. To avoid the imprisonment, hundreds thousand people left those areas with any possible mean in the night of March 7th, just before the law was signed by the prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, thus turning his purpose of slowing down the epidemics exactly into the opposite. The Governors of Southern regions adopted limitations for this huge mass of potentially infected incoming people, with the risk of disseminating suspicion in the population (\"hunting the greaser\"). Violence exploded in several prisons, due to the cancellation of all the family visits and fear of the virus. Just 48 hours later, the Italian Government has extended these exceptional war-like measures to the entire nation: nobody is allowed to exit from home other than for compelling job or health reasons; museums, cinemas, theatres, sport facilities, and even churches have been closed; restaurants and bars must stop at 6 PM their activity. Further restrictions are probably going to be considered in next days. The Italian prime minister was clear in his video-message of March 5th: the emergency does not come from the lethality of the virus, but from the impossibility of the Italian healthcare system to cope with the impact of a rapid epidemic spreading of the Covid-19.",

In Italy, the infection seems to show a 7-8% lethality, that can be even higher if considering possible deaths of some people currently in ICU. This could justify the adoption of such extraordinary measures by the Italian Government. However, there is the impression that \u00c0 despite the declarations made at the beginning of the year \u00c0 Italy was not prepared to face the epidemics because decision makers were not expecting a so rapid outbreak of the Covd-19 infection: no equipment had been previously stored (even masks and gloves were lacking) and no dedicated paths had been planned in case of emergency within the frame of an healthcare system that is already under-dimensioned and characterized by huge inequalities between the North and South of the country [3] .",

Also military hospitals (closed or partially used) can be included in the definition of a specific path dedicated to people affected by Covid-19 that has to be tailored on the \"worst scenario\" and activated without any delay in the next three weeks. All the doctors and nurses available in the different parts of the local health authorities (ASL), who have currently suspended their ordinary ambulatorial activities, as well as retired physicians on voluntary basis (through their professional organizations OMCEO), should be promptly trained and asked to give their contribution if needed.",

Only in this way will we be able to cope with the new challenges of climate changes (i.e. the expansion of malarial areas; million deaths due to air pollution etc.), the emerging of new viral zoonoses threatening human health [5] (as it is now for Covid-2019, and as it is for HIV, that continues to cause 776,000 victims every year), antibiotic resistance due to abuse in animal farms, and many other major issues that we will probably face in next future.
