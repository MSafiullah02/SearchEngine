It is transmitted from person to person who are in close contact (within about 1.8 meters). Furthermore, it is possible that the virus transmits by touching a surface or an object that has virus-containing respiratory droplets, and then touching the eyes, mouth or nose. 2 3 This mode of transmission may be important as coronavirus has been isolated from surfaces several days from dissemination. 4 As the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases increases, affected patients might frequently present to eye clinics or emergency departments. 5 When patients come to an ophthalmologist office for ocular examination, these patients have direct contact with examination equipment. A recent report by Lu and colleagues 3 suggested that ocular surfaces may be a potential mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and that ophthalmologists are highly prone to getting infected. Lai et al 6 reported infection control measures which were based on a three-level hierarchy of control measures: the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental control and administrative control. In addition, pandemics may potentially accelerate moves towards telemedicine, by which patients are treated by doctors and nurses remotely. 7 8 Our aim is to discuss the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology",

Telemedicine is widely used in paediatric ophthalmology for general screening for amblyopia, refraction and motility disorders, 32-34 as well as for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening. 35 36 Several components of the paediatric ophthalmological examination can be performed at home by guardians: visual acuity for near and distance can be measured using web-based applications. Using a printed chart and measuring the symbol size may control for hardware and software variations. This information is sufficient for treatment decisions for older children who are being treated for amblyopia. Parents can be instructed to perform basic eye movement examination and send a simple video, or use dedicated computer or phone applications, assisting with poststrabismus surgery examinations and other ocular movement disorders. Unfortunately, examination of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye requires either a professional or an expensive imaging instrument. The use of web-based refraction systems on paediatric patients is unreliable at this point due to calibration and validation issues. The presence of a good red reflex with good visual acuity and alignment may suffice to screen most healthy children until full examination is possible.",

Intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering modalities necessitate physical presence of the patient in the treating centre. Due to the potential risk of infection by using reusable eye equipment such as the Goldmann applanation tonometer, interventions were confined only to urgent and emergent cases, including primary and secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma, and primary and secondary open-angle glaucoma with uncontrolled IOP that is sightthreatening. 64 65 For screening and monitoring purposes, parameters were taken into consideration in assessing glaucoma, including IOP, corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth and morphology, optic disc appearance, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and the current visual field map. To minimise interactions, these parameters were measured remotely, by trained technicians, and sent to the treating physician, skipping patient-physician encounters.",

Therefore, patientdirected self-tonometry can be taken throughout the day and is becoming an important part of the delivery of care to patients with glaucoma.

Therefore, some oncologists suggested considering postponing adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery for less aggressive cancers. In contrast, it is well established that delayed oncological surgery may lead to disease progressions and result in tumours no longer resectable, leading to worse survival outcomes. Cortiula and colleagues 70 stated that patients with advanced disease and no suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 should keep receiving planned chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment, without unnecessary delays. Moreover, they highlighted that although postponing follow-up and cancer prevention appointments is a strategy to be considered, an excessive accumulation of visits or examinations risks burdening the national public health system over the next few months. Therefore, our ocular oncology service remained open for new patients with suspected ocular malignancies and follow-up of patients with known malignancies. The operating room was open to treat these patients, and specifically for examinations under anaesthesia and treatment of children with retinoblastoma. On the other hand, appointments of patients who were followed for nevi for an extended period have been postponed.",
