We also considered R = 3 as a sensitivity study given consensus that the reproductive number has been higher outside of Africa [12] . We start with cases timed according to the first 25 (or fewer) reported cases in the WHO SITREPs up to 23 March 2020 (SITREP 63) [4] . Using those epidemic parameters and initial cases and dates, we simulate the accumulation of reported cases. We assume there are always sufficient unreported infections to continue transmission, and that new cases represent a reporting sample from both identified and previously unidentified transmission chains. As long as a constant reporting fraction and delay persists during this period, and unreported spread is large relative to reported cases (or reporting does not represent effective control), this is a reasonable approximation.",

The international control efforts and travel restrictions to date likely slowed seeding of the epidemic, and other local efforts may have slowed spread once the epidemic was established. However, containment measures, e.g. travel restrictions, increased testing, contact tracing, isolation of cases and quarantine of contacts, are likely to slow, but not halt, real epidemic growth [15] . Indeed, increased testing may accelerate the time to reporting these numbers, as improved ascertainment increases the identified fraction of real cases. However, the model also optimistically assumes surveillance capacity is not overwhelmed or stymied, which would slow reaching 1,000 reported cases while the real disease burden grows uncontrolled. This model also assumes a homogeneous population, neglecting urban vs rural differences as well as connectivity between regions, distinctions, which would tend towards many small outbreaks, rather than the single one we model.

            "text": "Using reporting to date, and assuming similar epidemiological trends to those seen globally, we projected that all of the 45 African countries/territories reporting early cases were likely to report 1,000 cases by the end of April 2020, and 10,000 within another few weeks; with reported cases lagging and under-representing actual burden. Even considering reporting delays, timing is largely synchronised continent-wide. Our projections assumed no substantive changes between the initially reported cases and the forecast points; while some countries have taken drastic actions, invalidating those assumptions, others have not or have acted slowly (SI column in the Table) . As seen outside Africa, because onset of severe symptoms can be delayed weeks from infection and last several weeks, interventions have limited immediate impact on new hospitalisations or healthcare facility demand, meaning that most of the countries in our projection would be well past 1,000 real cases by the time the effects of interventions started in late March would be observed.",

Citizen awareness will also be critical, and officials should continue to promote preventive measures such as physical distancing and regular hand washing.",
