Our hospital uses two types of PAPRs: the Jupiter TM with 3M TM HT-101 Lightweight Hood (Figure 1 ), and the Versaflo TM TR-300 with 3M TM Hood Assembly S-855. In the initial phase of our pandemic response plan, our department prioritised JIT resources for infection prevention and control measures against AGP, with a focus on PAPR training, as these are infrequently used, and their effectiveness requires a high level of staff involvement.",
