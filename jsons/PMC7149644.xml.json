However, the exposure of the mucosal surface to exogenous materials also makes these tissues ports of entry for potentially pathogenic organisms. As a result, the immune system devotes enormous resources to the defense of mucosal surfaces. Although this defense needs to effectively prevent microbes from invading the underlying tissue, it must critically discriminate between innocuous antigens, commensal organisms, and pathogens in order to prevent inappropriate or inflammatory immune responses that might impair the physiological function of the host organ. Therefore mucosal lymphoid organs must have robust mechanisms to fine-tune immune responses to the types of antigen they encounter.",

In the gut, the inductive tissues, gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT), include the Peyer\u2019s patches, cecal patches, colonic patches, isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs), and cryptopatches, which, along with the gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), are inductive sites for adaptive immune responses to gut-derived antigens. In the respiratory tract, immune-inductive tissues include the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT), which, along with the cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs), generate adaptive immune responses to antigens encountered in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, respectively [1].",

These tissues are often referred to as ectopic or tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) [2]. Despite their different developmental origins, SLOs and TLOs share many overlapping developmental, architectural, and functional features. Nevertheless, the mechanistic details governing the immune functions of these organs are often different, in part owing to the stimuli that triggered their development and to the host organ in which they reside. Given that mucosal lymphoid organs can be involved in either pathogenesis, symbiosis or immune protection in a variety of clinical conditions and experimental disease models, it is essential to understand the mechanistic details controlling the development and function of each type of mucosal lymphoid organ in order to intervene in local mucosal immune responses. In this chapter, we will discuss the specific mechanisms that control the structure, development, and function of various mucosal lymphoid tissues in the respiratory and digestive tracts.",

For example, the gut lamina propria of jawless fish contains lymphoid aggregates that fulfill both hematopoietic and immune response functions, including the development of VLR-expressing cells as well as the proliferation and differentiation of those cells after antigenic encounter [8], [9], [10]. Similarly, the GALT of rabbits facilitates the diversification of the primary BCR repertoire and promotes antigen-dependent immune responses [11], [12]. However, in other vertebrates, the generation of the primary lymphocyte repertoire is physically separated from the immune response to environmental antigens. Nevertheless, the GALT in all vertebrates is involved in immune responses to the luminal contents of the digestive tract.",

The likeliest explanation is that, although a widely diverse repertoire of antigen receptors allows the recognition of a broad array of antigens, the frequency of any particular receptor that recognizes any particular antigen is very low, thereby reducing the probability that those few antigen-specific lymphocytes will encounter their cognate antigens. Given that mucosal tissues are continuously exposed to the external environment and that the digestive tract in particular is filled with a myriad of microorganisms, it makes sense that vertebrates evolved clusters of antigen-receptor-bearing lymphocytes directly beneath the mucosal epithelium, where they would be in close contact with potential antigens.",

The evolution of specialized antigen-presenting cells, B cells and T cells, all of which need to interact for successful immune responses, requires mechanisms for these cells to find each other and additional mechanisms to support their proliferation and survival during immune responses [14]. In this regard, the development of specialized stromal cells, including fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) in the T cell area and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in the B cell area, is likely a key innovation. These cell types provide the scaffolding of lymphoid organs and help to spatially organize lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. For example, FRCs express the chemokine CCL19, which attracts T cells and activated dendritic cells (DCs) into the T cell zone [18], [19], whereas FDCs express the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13, which attract B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and direct their spatial positioning in the B cell follicle and germinal center [20], [21], [22], [23]. Although B and T cell separation occurs in amphibians and reptiles, identifiable stromal cells such as FDCs are observed only in birds and mammals [14] (Fig. 2.1), which probably explains why these species (and not others) are able to support germinal center responses and generate high-affinity antibodies [24], [25]. Thus the mechanisms that control the differentiation of stromal cell elements are critical for the proper organization and function of lymphoid organs.",

For example, the development and organization of lymphoid tissues are regulated, in part, by the activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members, TNF\u03b1, lymphotoxin-\u03b1 (LT-\u03b1), and LT-\u03b2, and their receptors [26], [27], [28]. These genes are functionally expressed in lymphoid organs of higher vertebrates and sarcopterygian fish (lungfish and coelacanth) but not in teleost fish [16], an observation that correlates with lymphoid organization in each of these species. Interestingly, despite being evolutionarily advanced vertebrates, avian species appear to have lost the gene cluster encoding TNF, LT-\u03b1, and LT-\u03b2, as well as other TNF family members [29], [30], [31], which perhaps explains their inability to develop LNs [14]. However, avian species still develop highly organized mucosal lymphoid tissues, including cecal tonsil, esophageal tonsil, and Peyer\u2019s patches [32], [33], [34], [35], suggesting that additional or alternative TNF family members contribute to the development and organization of these tissues.\n",

Importantly, the various TNF superfamily members and their receptors often have overlapping functions. As a result, different TNF superfamily ligand\u2013receptor pairs are often used for similar purposes in different mucosal lymphoid tissues, depending on the cell types involved and the timing of the interactions. In the following sections, we will highlight which TNF superfamily members are important for the various features and functions of mucosal lymphoid tissues.",

Their distribution is not homogenous, with a higher frequency in the ileum and colon compared to the duodenum and jejunum. As their name suggests, cryptopatches are found beneath the crypts at the base of the intestinal villi; they consist of a small cluster (fewer than 1000 cells) of c-kit+, IL-7R+ lymphocytes, and CD11c+CX3CR1+ myeloid cells, but almost no B cells, T cells, or identifiable stromal cell networks [54] (Fig. 2.2\n). Initially, the c-kit+IL-7R+ cells were thought to be precursors of intestinal epithelial lymphocytes, and cryptopatches were thought to serve as sites of extrathymic T cell development [55]. However, more recent data show that the c-kit+IL-7R+ cells in cryptopatches are actually innate lymphoid cells (ILC3 cells) [56], [57], which depend on the transcription factor ROR\u03b3t and produce cytokines such as IL-17, IL-22, and GM-CSF [58], [59] (Chapter 14: Innate Lymphoid Cells for the Control of Mucosal Immunity).",

For example, in response to microbial signals, the CX3CR1+ myeloid cells in cryptopatches produce IL-23, which triggers the activation of ILC3 cells and their expression of cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22 [68] (Fig. 2.2). These cytokines contribute to antimicrobial defense in the intestine by promoting the expression of antimicrobial molecules [69], triggering the recruitment of granulocytes [70], and enhancing epithelial proliferation and repair [71], [72]. Upon the appropriate stimulation, CX3CR1+ myeloid cells produce additional cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and TL1A, which also trigger ILC3 cell activation and the expression of IL-17 and IL-22 [73].",

Conversely, the inflammatory activation of CX3CR1+ myeloid cells leads to IL-23-driven activation and GM-CSF production by ILC3 cells, which in turn promotes colitis [76], [77]. Moreover, GM-CSF feeds back on ILC3 cells, leading to their mobilization from cryptopatches and inflammation throughout the gut [76]. In fact, a variety of microbial signals trigger CX3CR1+ myeloid cells to express inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-23, and TL1A, that activate ILC3 cells to produce GM-CSF [74], [75].

For example, the production and maintenance of ILC3 cells depend on vitamin-A-derived retinoic acid [78], which promotes expression of the transcription factor ROR\u03b3t in developing ILC3 cells [79]. Similarly, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, AHR, is expressed by ILC3 cells and senses soluble aromatic hydrocarbons that are produced by commensal bacteria or derived from the diet [80]. The AHR is essential for ILC3, for the development of ILC3 cells, and for their production of cytokines such as IL-22 [57]. ILC3 cells also sense oxysterols through the G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR183 [81], which is expressed by CCR6-expressing ILC3 cells in the cryptopatches and ILFs. Oxysterol compounds are constitutively produced by fibroblastic stromal cells [81], which recruit ILC3 cells to the cryptopatches and ILFs under steady-state conditions. Moreover, oxysterols are produced at higher levels during inflammatory responses, leading to local ILC3 activation and promoting inflammatory responses. Thus a variety of environmental triggers activate ILC3 cells in cryptopatches and help to maintain barrier function during homeostasis and trigger inflammatory responses following infection.",

The B cell follicle of ILFs is positioned beneath a specialized dome epithelium containing M cells that transport antigen from the intestinal lumen to the leukocytes beneath [67] (Fig. 2.3\n). A small number of T cells, primarily CD4+ cells, are present in the B cell follicle but do not form a discrete T cell zone. Dendritic cells are found beneath the dome and surrounding the B cell follicle [82]. Like cryptopatches, ILFs contain a significant fraction of CCR6-expressing ILC3 cells [83].",

In contrast, the transition of cryptopatches to ILFs requires microbial exposure, which activates intestinal epithelial cells via innate sensing mechanisms, including peptidoglycan recognition by NOD1 in epithelial cells [86].

Although the blockade of \u03b14\u03b27 has no effect on the numbers or cellularity of cryptopatches, it significantly impairs their ability to transition into ILFs [87].",

For example, mature ILFs have a dome epithelium with M cells that express CCL20 [86], which recruits specialized DCs, B and T cells [83], [86], which cluster beneath the M cell-containing dome epithelium, where they await antigens that are transported across the epithelium. CCL20 expression by epithelial cells is also important for the development of ILFs, because it attracts CCR6+ ILC3 cells, which express lymphotoxin and other activating ligands that promote the differentiation of M cells and the maturation of fibroblastic stromal cells that support the lymphoid structure of the ILF [83]. Epithelial cells also produce IL-7, which expands ILC3 cells and promotes their expression of lymphotoxin. In fact, cryptopatches and ILFs fail to develop in the absence of IL-7, primarily owing to the absence of ILC3 cells.",

Interestingly, ILFs are also an important source of T-cell-independent antimicrobial IgA [89], with no direct relation to the immune responses occurring in Peyer\u2019s patches [90]. Recent work has broadened our understanding of the role of ILFs, and a general consensus is that they act in a tolerogenic manner to control intestinal immune responses by generating both IgA-secreting plasma cells and regulatory T cells [91], [92], both of which are involved in the noninflammatory containment of commensal organisms. Conversely, the absence of ILFs leads to poor IgA production and a dramatic expansion of the intestinal microbiota [88]. Thus ILFs are powerhouses of IgA production in response to microbial antigens [90].",

The FRCs also facilitate T cell trafficking within the interfollicular region [19], [21] and help to coordinate interactions between antigen-presenting DCs and na\u00efve T cells. Importantly, FRCs in the interfollicular areas express IL-7 [118], [119], a cytokine necessary for the homeostatic maintenance of na\u00efve T cells. Although FRCs are primarily associated with the T cell zones of lymphoid organs, they also extend into the B cell follicles, where they express IL-7 and BAFF [120], which maintains the viability of B cells. Finally, FRCs in Peyer\u2019s patches modulate the activity of ILC1 cells through the transpresentation of IL-15 [121].

CCL20 is also important for attracting B cells to the dome, where they interact with CD11b+ DCs and isotype-switch to IgA [88], [122]. Another chemokine, CXCL16, is also expressed by the dome epithelium of Peyer\u2019s patches, ILFs, and cecal patches [123], whereas its receptor, CXCR6, is observed on subpopulations of activated and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the dome region.

In fact, M cells express a variety of receptor-like molecules that help them sample a wide array of microbial pathogens and antigens. Some of these receptors have been identified by comparing gene expression profiles of M cells with those of enterocytes [125]. For example, the GPI-anchored glycoprotein 2 (GP2) is expressed on the luminal surface of M cells and acts as a receptor for type I piliated bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium\n[126]. Similarly, a homolog of GP2, the urinary protein uromodulin, is also expressed on M cells [127], [128], where it also binds type I piliated E. coli. Another GPI-anchored protein, the cellular prion protein (PrPc), is also abundantly expressed on the luminal surface of M cells [125], [129]. PrPc interacts with Hsp60 of Brucella abortus and helps its internalization into M cells [130]. Other M-cell-expressed proteins with potential antigen-sampling activity include ANXA5, which binds the lipid A domain of LPS and facilitates the uptake of Gram-negative bacteria [131], and the peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGLRP)-1, which binds to bacterial peptidoglycans [132] (Chapter 28: M Cell-Targeted Vaccines).",

For example, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, S. typhimurium, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, polio virus, and reovirus all use M cells and the receptors they express as ports of entry [133], [134], [135]. Moreover, the enterotoxin of Clostridium perfringens (CPE) binds to members of the Claudin tight-junction protein family, one of which, Claudin 4, is expressed in the cytoplasm of M cells, where it facilitates endocytosis [136]. In fact, peptides from the c-terminal domain of CPE binds to Claudin 4 can be used to target vaccine antigens to M cells [137]. Similarly, a peptide from the outer membrane protein H (OmpH \u03b21\u03b11) of Y. enterocolitica binds to C5aR on the luminal surface of M cells, and it can be used to enhance antigen uptake and mucosal vaccine responsiveness [138]. Thus the natural antigen-sampling activity of M cells can be exploited to enhance mucosal vaccination and tolerance.",

The process by which na\u00efve B cells become activated and switch to IgA is very dependent on the structural architecture and cell types in GALT. In particular, activated B cells use the chemokine receptor CCR6 to migrate to the dome region of Peyer\u2019s patches, where they interact with DCs that prompt B cells to undergo isotype-switching to IgA [88]. Switching to IgA requires B cells to encounter active TGF-\u03b2, which is converted from the latent form by integrin \u03b1v\u03b28-expressing DCs in the dome epithelium [99]. Isotype-switching to IgA also requires ILC3 cells [56], [80], which provide lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R)-dependent signals to DCs and stromal cells. A similar process likely occurs in ILFs, although much of the IgA production in ILFs occurs independently of T cells [89].",

LTin cells are defined as CD45+CD11c+c-kit+ cells that express the LT\u03b2R and the tyrosine kinase receptor, RET [140]. LTin cells are activated by the recognition of the RET ligands, leading to LTin accumulation around VCAM+ LTo cells, which become activated and express CXCL13, thereby prompting the recruitment and clustering of CXCR5-expressing LTi cells [143]. The reciprocal interactions between LT\u03b1\u03b2-expressing LTi cells and LT\u03b2R-expressing LTo cells reinforce the expression of CXCL13 and leads to the development of the Peyer\u2019s patch anlagen. Once the Peyer\u2019s patch anlagen is established, the developing stromal compartment recruits additional leukocytes via the induced expression of cytokines (IL-7, VEGF-C, and RANK ligand) [27], chemokines (CXCL12, CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21), and adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) [144]. Taken together, these molecules help to recruit leukocytes and lymphocytes, maintain their survival, and promote their spatial positioning.\n",

Once Peyer\u2019s patches are fully developed and populated, leukocytes help to maintain stromal cell differentiation; B cells are particularly important for the maintenance of FDCs [151], whereas DCs are important for the maintenance of FRCs [152]. Finally, the interactions between the microbiota and epithelial cells are arguably as important as the interactions between leukocytes and stromal cells for the maintenance of Peyer\u2019s patches [153], particularly for the differentiation of M cells [154], the expression of epithelial chemokines, and the organization of the dome region [129].",

For example, although the development and maturation of ILFs in the small intestine require microbial colonization, the ILFs in the colon develop independently of microbial colonization and signaling through CCR6, RANK, and CXCL13 [94]. In contrast, colonic ILFs have specific requirements that the small intestine ILFs do not. For example, colonic ILFs require MyD88-dependent signals for maturation [94], whereas small intestine ILFs do not. Similarly, colonic ILFs require IL-23 signaling [155] but are suppressed by IL-25 signaling. These observations suggest that the molecular mediators of ILF maturation differ between the small and large intestines, with colonic ILFs more dependent on microbial detection and small intestine ILFs more dependent on danger signals.",

However, instead of primary interactions between CXCR5-expressing LTi cells and CXCL13-expressing LTo cells, the formation of cryptopatches is dependent on interactions between CCR6-expressing ILC3 cells and CCL20-expressing epithelial cells [83], which also produce IL-7 and thereby help to maintain ILC3 cells [54]. Moreover, like the development of most lymphoid tissues, the formation of cryptopatches is entirely dependent on ROR\u03b3t [87], which is essential for ILC3 differentiation.

Alternatively, ILC3 cells can be activated directly by metabolic products that engage the AHR [57] or by IL-23 generated from activated myeloid cells [155]. Once ILC3 cells are activated, they express LT\u03b1\u03b2 and trigger the differentiation of LT\u03b2R-expressing stromal cell precursors, which upregulate CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21 as well as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 for the recruitment and retention of lymphocytes [157]. Further accumulation of B cells, recruitment of T cells, and differentiation of follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) mark the maturation of an ILF. The cytokine RANKL (receptor activator of NF-\u039aB ligand) and its receptor (RANK) are crucial for the maturation of ILFs [158] but not for the formation of CPs, primarily because of the role of RANK signaling in the differentiation of M cells, which will be discussed in the next section.",

RANK signaling activates TRAF6 and NF-\u039aB in epithelial cells [160] and triggers the expression of the transcription factor Spi-B, which is required for the final maturation and accumulation of M cells in the dome epithelium [160]. Interestingly, the systemic administration of RANKL induces the ectopic differentiation of enterocytes into M cells throughout the villous epithelium [161], suggesting that any enterocyte is capable of differentiating into M cells but that the normal availability of RANK ligand is spatially restricted to the epithelium overlaying lymphoid clusters or FAE.

The factors provided by B cells (or other hematopoietic cells) that stimulate M cell differentiation include signaling between B cells and M cells via CD137L/CD137 [50] or macrophage migration inhibitory factor [171].",

M cells with short microvilli and microfold morphology are easily identified in the dome epithelium of NALT as well as turbinate epithelium of nasal cavity [96], [183] and efficiently acquire luminal antigens and particulates [184], which they transcytose across the epithelium. Not surprisingly, NALT M cells express markers, including GP2, Tnfaip2, and Spi-B [184], which are also expressed in M cells of the intestinal tract. CCR6-expressing DCs and B cells fill the dome region under the epithelium and are closely associated with M cells [185].

Although the development of NALT resembles that of ILFs in the sense that it occurs after birth in response to antigenic or microbial encounter [190], there are important differences in terms of the cell types and molecular pathways required for its development. For example, LTi cells seem dispensable for NALT formation [191] as well as for LDALT formation [189], since mice that are deficient in the transcription factor ROR\u03b3t (and therefore deficient in ILC3 cells, including LTi cells [191], [192]) still have apparently normal NALT structures. Similarly, mice lacking IL-7 (which fail to support LTi cells as well as most lymphocytes) still have rudimentary NALT structures. In contrast, mice lacking the transcription factor Id2 (which lack all ILC cells [142]) completely fail to develop NALT [191]. Thus it seems that an ILC population other than ILC3 cells or LTi cells is required for NALT development. In this regard, ILC2 cells are more prominently represented in the respiratory tract than are ILC3 cells [1], [193].",

However, mucosal lymphoid tissues in the respiratory and digestive tracts are not functionally identical [207]. However, immunization or infection of the nasal passages typically elicits as much IgG as IgA [208]. These responses are clearly biased by the type of adjuvant involved, as immunization with cholera toxin typically leads to IgA responses [205], [209], whereas protein-containing microparticles primarily elicit IgG responses [210]. Infection with common respiratory viruses, such as influenza [211] and reovirus [212], elicits both IgG- and IgA-secreting cells in NALT. Nevertheless, B cells responding to influenza more often switch to IgA in NALT than in mediastinal LNs, lung, or spleen [213]. Intriguingly, IgA memory B cells generated in NALT accumulate more somatic mutations than do IgG memory cells [214], suggesting a selective entry into the memory compartment, perhaps by interactions with the CCR6-expressing DCs in the subepithelial dome region (Chapter 7: Induction and Regulation of Mucosal Memory B Cell Responses).",

Therefore the lower respiratory tract has to be protected by robust immunological mechanisms. However, the lung is also the primary site of gas exchange, which is most efficient when the distance between the respiratory epithelium of the alveoli and the vascular endothelium of the capillaries is minimized. As a result, the delicate structures of the lower lung are susceptible to damage by inflammatory responses, implying that immune responses in the lung must be appropriately tempered to provide protection against pathogens without causing undue inflammation and damage.",

In fact, some species have mucosal lymphoid structures, termed BALT, along the respiratory tract [215], [216], [217]. However, the lungs of healthy humans have relatively few BALT-like areas [218], [219], and the lungs of mice from clean animal facilities completely lack such structures [220]. Nevertheless, humans with chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [221], [222], [223], hypersensitivity pneumonitis [224], and even pulmonary complications of rheumatoid arthritis [225], [226], [227] have many well-developed BALT-like areas that seem to react with local antigens. Moreover, mice also develop BALT-like structures in their lungs following pulmonary infection or inflammation [228] (Fig. 2.6\n). These findings suggest that the BALT-like areas in humans and mice are not true SLOs that develop during embryogenesis but instead are ectopic or tertiary lymphoid tissues that develop in response to local inflammation [228], [229]. Interestingly, some mammals, such as pigs and goats, develop BALT during gestation [215], [230], [231], [232], [233], apparently independent of exposure to antigen or microbes, suggesting that in these species, BALT is a true SLO. Therefore to distinguish between BALT formed according to a developmental program and the lung-associated lymphoid tissues that are inducible and are formed after inflammation, we coined the term \u201cinducible BALT\u201d (iBALT) [225], [234], [235].",

BALT-like lymphoid aggregates in the lung have a spectrum of phenotypes, beginning with a small, loosely organized cluster of B cells that lacks FDCs and ending with a dense lymphoid accumulation that includes multiple germinal-center-containing B cell follicles arranged on networks of CD21-expressing FDCs and separated by interfollicular T cell areas with networks of podoplanin-expressing FRCs [229], [240], [241]. In some cases, iBALT areas can be found with extensive FDC networks and germinal-center-containing B cell follicles but no discernible T cell areas [229], [241]. In other cases, however, iBALT areas can be observed with dense clusters of T cells and podoplanin-expressing FRCs but no B cell follicles [229], [241]. These different structures are undoubtedly distinct at a functional level; however, the underlying reasons why different types of structures are formed remain unclear.",

However, the absence of M cells in the iBALT of mice and humans raises the question of how these tissues acquire antigen. In this regard, it is clear that areas of iBALT have associated lymphatic vessels around the B cell follicle at the edge of the T cell area [243], [244]. In fact, the inflammatory processes that trigger iBALT formation also trigger the growth of new lymphatic vessels [245]. It seems likely that some of these vessels are efferent lymphatic vessels that carry effector cells away from iBALT and toward the downstream draining mediastinal LN. However, some of these vessels may also be afferent lymphatics that carry antigen and DCs from distal portions of the lung into iBALT. In fact, nasally administered DCs rapidly migrate into the T cell areas of iBALT, most probably via afferent lymphatic vessels [43], [246], [247].",

In contrast, the iBALT that forms in plt/plt mice (lacking both CCL19 and CCL21 [240], [250]), has B cell follicles with FDCs but fails to develop T cell areas and cannot form germinal centers [250], probably owing to the failure of Tfh differentiation.

However, many of the core mechanisms involved in SLO development are also involved in the formation of iBALT. In general, iBALT is formed most easily during the neonatal period in both mice and humans [219], [240], perhaps owing to increased frequencies of ILCs or decreased frequencies of Tregs [240], [251], [252]. In fact, CCR7-deficient mice spontaneously develop iBALT, owing to the inability of Tregs to suppress pulmonary inflammation [251], [253], [254]. Conversely, the reconstitution of CCR7-deficient mice with WT Tregs prevents the formation of iBALT [251]. These observations are likely pertinent for the development of iBALT and other ectopic lymphoid tissues in autoimmune patients, who often have defects in Treg function.",

This observation implies that other cell types such as ILC2 cells, which are common in neonatal lungs [255], may play important roles in iBALT formation. Despite the nonessential role of ILC3 cells, both IL-17 and IL-22 are important for the formation of iBALT in response to the inert inflammatory molecules, LPS [240]. These cytokines are provided by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and follicular-homing Th17 cells during iBALT development [240]. The role of these cytokines is somewhat surprising, given that iBALT forms independently of ROR\u03b3t, which is normally required for the differentiation of ILC3 cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, and Th17 cells. Thus it seems that there are redundant mechanisms for iBALT formation when IL-17 is limiting.",

Neutrophils and other granulocytes cause damage, in part because of the release of proteases [257], [258], [259], which trigger the expression of homeostatic and inflammatory chemokines and lead to iBALT formation [259]. Similarly, IL-17 directly promotes the expression of the homeostatic chemokines CXCL13 and CCL19 [240], [260], [261], which are important for the recruitment of B and T cells and for the formation of iBALT. Although IL-17 promotes the expression of these chemokines under inflammatory conditions, lymphotoxin signaling maintains the expression of these chemokines under homeostatic conditions [240], [241], [261]. Thus once iBALT is formed, it no longer requires IL-17 but instead requires lymphotoxin-expressing lymphocytes and DCs to maintain stromal architecture, chemokine expression, and HEV differentiation.",

However, the initial activation of T cells can also be observed in iBALT following the intranasal administration of antigen-loaded DCs [247]. Moreover, the formation of germinal centers in iBALT is a clear sign that antigen-specific B cells are being primed locally [265]. Furthermore, antigen-specific plasmablasts accumulate at the border between the B cell follicle and the T cell area [265], suggesting that they were generated locally. Interestingly, immune responses triggered in BALT do not seem to bias the antibody class switch toward a particular isotype, such as IgA [265]. This observation might be explained by the lack of a dome epithelium (or FAE) and specialized DCs that facilitate the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and promote IgA switching.

In the context of pulmonary infection, the presence of iBALT is uniformly beneficial and usually leads to faster clearance of the pathogen with less pulmonary and systemic pathology [228]. For example, immune responses against pulmonary infection with influenza virus, SARS corona virus, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are all more effective when iBALT is present in the lung [235], [265], [272], [273], [274]. In part, this success can be attributed to an accelerated B cell and antibody response [234], [273], [275]. Given the location of antigen-specific germinal center B cells and plasmablasts, this faster B cell response may be simply due to proximity to antigen. Alternatively, the local differentiation of T cells may be biased toward Tfh cells rather than effector cells. Given the unique functional attributes of iBALT, it may be desirable to develop vaccines that transiently induce iBALT for the initiation of antigen-specific humoral and/or cellular immunity against respiratory pathogens.",

For example, areas of iBALT are found in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis [224], rheumatic lung disease [225], [227], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [223], [276], [277], and even idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [254], [278]. These diseases are associated with chronic inflammation and continual or repeated exposure to antigens. Moreover antigen-specific B and T cells are found in the iBALT areas [235], suggesting that they are contributing to disease pathogenesis. Despite the link between chronic lung disease and the formation of iBALT, it is not clear whether iBALT is exacerbating disease or is actually attenuating inflammation by sequestering antigens and effector cells.",
