            "text": "Human noroviruses (HuNoV), belonging to the genus Norovirus in the Caliciviridae family, are associated with person\u2010to\u2010person, food and waterborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Efforts to fully characterize their properties are hampered because HuNoV has yet to be grown readily in cell culture and there is no animal model (Duizer et al. 2004a; Straub et al. 2007). Because of these limitations, various surrogate viruses have been used to predict HuNoV behaviour following inactivation treatments by heat, high pressure and disinfection. Previously, feline calicivirus (FeCV) (Doultree et al. 1999; 2003a, 2003b, 2005a, 2005b; Duizer et al. 2004b; Bae and Schwab 2008; Buckow et al. 2008), canine calicivirus (CaCV) (De Roda Husman et al. 2004; Duizer et al. 2004b), hepatitis A virus (HAV) (Bidawid et al. 2000; Mariam and Cliver 2000; Kingsley et al. 2002; Hewitt and Greening 2004), poliovirus (Mariam and Cliver 2000; Strazynski et al. 2002; Bae and Schwab 2008) and bacteriophages (Mariam and Cliver 2000; Dawson et al. 2005; Bae and Schwab 2008) have been used as surrogates for HuNoV. Some of these viruses have demonstrated their unsuitability as HuNoV surrogates. For example, FeCV is readily inactivated by heat (Slomka and Appleton 1998) and loses significant viability when subjected to low pH (Hewitt and Greening 2004), in contrast to HuNoV which is resistant at pH 2\u00b77 for 3 h at room temperature (Dolin et al.1972).",

            "text": "In 2004, murine norovirus (MNV), a genogroup V culturable norovirus that infects mice, was reported and characterized (Karst et al. 2003). The virus is readily cultured on the mouse dendritic cell line, RAW 264.7 and can be quantified easily using a plaque assay. Because of its taxonomic relationship to HuNoV, MNV is considered a potential surrogate for increasing knowledge of HuNoV properties and mode of replication (2004, 2006; Ward et al. 2007). Recently, MNV has been used as a surrogate for HuNoV in studies of high pressure processing (Kingsley et al. 2007; Buckow et al. 2008), UV, pH, temperature, disinfection (Cannon et al. 2006; Belliot et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008) and in survival studies in water (Bae and Schwab 2008) and shellfish (Kingsley et al. 2007). However, it is not certain that any results obtained for MNV are truly representative of HuNoV. HAV is also regarded as a potential surrogate for HuNoV as both viruses share similar transmission pathways and are known to be environmentally stable (Carter 2005; Boone and Gerba 2007).",

The apparent differences in the reductions of HuNoV qRT\u2010PCR titre compared with MNV and HAV may be explained by differences in their susceptibility to heat at 63 and 72\u00b0C. On heating, changes in the virus capsid structure occur, resulting in loss of infectivity. It is possible that in some viruses RNA may also be destroyed which will result in a lower qRT\u2010PCR titre. For HuNoV, we observed that the reduction in qRT\u2010PCR titre was greater at 72\u00b0C than at 63\u00b0C, since presumably more damage was occurring at 72\u00b0C. Although qRT\u2010PCR results do not fully reflect the degree of damage on the infectivity status (Richards 1999), they may provide some indication of the extent of capsid damage. These results are in agreement with our previous studies (Hewitt and Greening 2006) and that of other researchers who also found heat inactivation affected the infectivity more than the integrity of the viral genome (Baert et al. 2008). From the qRT\u2010PCR results, we can hypothesize that loss of HuNoV infectivity may be lower than for HAV and MNV, although currently this cannot be confirmed by culture. Significant differences in log reduction were observed between HuNoV GI and GII, with GI being less affected by heat than HuNoV, MNV and HAV.",

However the reduction in qRT\u2010PCR titre for HAV, compared with the other viruses used in this study, was interesting. The initial decrease of HAV qRT\u2010PCR titre in the first minute with little further decrease thereafter was similar to the effect reported for HAV infectivity by Bidawid et al. (2000) who noted that rapid inactivation with the first minute was followed by a slower inactivation rate (\u2018plateau\u2019 effect). It was postulated that this may have been due to the effect of the presence of nonaggregated virus particles that would be inactivated quickly and aggregates that would take longer to be inactivated. If this is correct and the qRT\u2010PCR titre does give some indication of capsid damage, then it does not explain why MNV and HuNoV did not follow the same trend, as it is reasonable to assume that aggregates and nonaggregated virus particles would also be present in MNV and HuNoV preparations.",
