The frontal prominence forms during the 4th postovulatory week and gives rise to the superior and middle portions of the face. The maxillary and nasal swellings form beneath the frontal prominence. At the end of the 4th week surface thickening of the nasal swellings forms the nasal placodes, which are of ectodermal origin and give rise to the epithelial lining of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. The placodes invaginate, producing the nasal pits that become the anterior choanae (nostrils) and, less superficially, the primitive posterior choanae. The medial nasal and frontal processes give rise to the nasal septum, frontal bones, nasal bones, ethmoid sinus complexes and upper incisors. The lateral nasal and maxillary processes fuse to form the philtrum and columella. The cartilaginous nasal capsule forms deep to the nasal and frontal bones from the chondrocranium (skull base) during the 7th and 8th postovulatory weeks. The paranasal sinuses develop from the lateral nasal walls at the 6th foetal week, and their growth continues after birth, throughout childhood and adolescence.",

The nasolacrimal duct opens in the inferior meatus, whereas the middle meatus receives drainage from the frontal, anterior ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.

Allergens combine with the IgE antibodies produced by the plasma cells of the nasal mucosa, which are avidly bound to the Fc-epsilon receptors on mast cells. This triggers degranulation of mast cells and releases the inflammatory mediators of the type I hypersensitivity reaction, causing rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction. Microscopically, the nasal mucosa shows numerous eosinophils, abundant plasma and in some cases an increased number of mast cells. There is goblet cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium and the basement membrane, which is destroyed in the acute phase, appears considerably thickened in the chronic phase.",

Males are predominantly affected. Patients tend to be younger than with other types of schneiderian papilloma. Exophytic papillomas are almost always unilateral [54] . No side is preferred and bilaterality is exceptional. The tumour is composed of branching papillary structures, with papillae covered by stratified non-keratinising squamous epithelium, admixed with intermediate or transitional cells and with ciliated respiratory epithelium that contains interspersed mucin-secreting cells. Koilocytosis is not infrequently found in the squamous epithelium. Seromucinous glands are abundantly found when the underlying submucosa is removed. The two main differential diagnoses are inverted papilloma and oncocytic papilloma. Neither the invaginated pattern of growth of inverted papillomas nor the oncocytic columnar epithelium of oncocytic papillomas are found in exophytic papillomas [173] . Cylindrical cell carcinoma can be easily ruled out by the lack of atypia and invasion. Wide surgical excision is the best choice of treatment to avoid recurrences.

This lesion occurs almost exclusively in the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and in the paranasal sinuses, although on rare occasions it may also arise on the nasal septum [226] . Grossly, they frequently have a polypoid appearance, but they differ from nasal polyps of the common type by their histological features. Inverted papillomas are composed of invaginating crypts, cords and nests covered by non-keratinising squamous epithelium, which alternates with columnar ciliated respiratory epithelium and with intermediate or transitional epithelium (Fig. 2.4a ). This newly formed duct system is similar to the embryonic development of the nasal mucosa [240] . The multilayered epithelium typically contains mucous cells and mucin-filled micro-cysts. The invagination of the mucosa may result in the presence of apparently discontinuous cell masses lying deep to the epithelial surface, but the basement membrane is intact and may be shown in continuity with that of the surface epithelium [226] . An inverted growth is the hallmark of inverted papilloma, but varying degrees of papillary growth may be seen at the surface [54] . The surface is characteristically lined by a respiratory type of epithelium; nevertheless, foci of surface keratinisation are occasionally present [122] . A few regular mitoses may be found in the basal and parabasal layers. Although the nuclei may show mild nuclear irregularities and hyperchromatism, no disturbances of the cellular polarity are found. An abundant and oedematous connective tissue stroma is a common feature of inverted papillomas. It usually contains macrophages and neutrophils, but eosinophils may also be present. This inflammatory infiltrate may also be present between the epithelial cells, within the dilated lumens of invaginated crypts, and within the numerous microcysts that usually occur in the respiratory epithelium. Seromucinous glands are absent, but branching gland ducts are often present. The tumour grows by extension to involve the contiguous sinonasal epithelium.",

It constitutes less than 5% of all sinonasal papillomas [18, 122, 173, 262] . Both sexes are equally affected. Bilaterality has not been documented. Tumours are in general small, although occasionally may reach various centimetre measurements in their greatest dimension. They are composed of exophytic fronds and endophytic invaginations lined by pseudostratified or multilayered columnar cells with prominent onco-cytic features. The cells have uniform hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic, occasionally granular, cytoplasm that contains abundant mitochondria and stains for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome C oxidase [59] . Goblet cells are not found. Cilia may be occasionally encountered on the superficial epithelial layer. Intraepithelial microcysts containing mucin and neutrophils are usually present. These microcysts are larger than the similar structures also seen in inverted papilloma. The tumour resembles inverted papilloma in its sites of occurrence, the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and the maxillary antrum. The rate of recurrence is considered to be 36%, which is lower than in inverted papilloma. The low frequency of this tumour makes it difficult to evaluate its true malignant potential, which seems to be similar to that of inverted papilloma [262] . Atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in situ changes can be occasionally found (Fig. 2.5 ). Surgical excision with wide margins is the treatment of choice. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma have been reported in association with oncocytic papilloma [18, 122, 135, 265, 274 ].",

The tumour contains numerous thin-walled blood vessels and the tumour cells, typically arranged around the blood vessels, are of uniform size with regular oval or elongated nuclei and pale cytoplasm ( Fig. 2.6 ). The cells may also be arranged in short, haphazard fascicles or in sheets of closely packed cells containing compressed capillaries. Areas of poor cellularity, myxoid change and fibrosis are not uncommon. The tumour cells are entirely situated outside the capillaries, which are lined by a single layer or normal-looking endothelium. This feature, well shown by reticulin staining or by anti-collagen IV antibodies, helps to distinguish the tumour from angiosarcoma. The distinction from other well-vascularised mesenchymal tumours is usually made by exclusion. Haemangiopericytomas of the nasal cavity are generally less aggressive than those occurring elsewhere. They exhibit a more orderly structure with minimal mitotic activity, but tend to recur after removal and may rarely metastasise [249] . Muscle-specific actin is focally positive in tumour cells.

Its morphologic and immunohistochemical profile is identical to that of leiomyomas of other sites. It has been postulated that they may originate from blood vessel walls. Distinction from sinonasal leiomyosarcoma is based on the absence of atypia and mitoses. Huang and Antonescu have proposed separating a category of smooth muscle tumours of uncertain malignant potential, characterised by the presence of 1-4 mitotic figures/10 high power fields, that tend to pursue a more aggressive behaviour than leiomyomas [119] .",

They usually present as polypoid lesions involving the nasal cavity and/or a paranasal sinus, with non-specific symptoms of obstruction, compression, or extension in the surrounding structures [202] . Histologically, the tumour is composed of elongated wavy-shaped monomorphic spindle cells, with eosinophilic cytoplasm and oval nucleus. Antoni type A and type B areas usually coexist within the lesion, and nuclear palisading may be present. Focal degenerative nuclear atypia has been described [108] , while mitotic activity is absent to low. A consistently reported feature of sinonasal schwannomas is the lack of tumour encapsulation that determines an apparently infiltrative growth pattern [36, 108] . Immunohistochemically, sinonasal schwannoma is intensely reactive for S-100 protein [108] . The differential diagnosis includes other spindle cell lesions of the sinonasal mucosa, like juvenile angiofibroma, solitary fibrous tumour and leiomyoma. Particular care should be taken when evaluating cellular schwannomas with a predominance of Antoni type A areas, which should not be confused with malignant spindle cell neoplasms, like fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, and spindle cell melanoma. Neurofibromas of the sinonasal mucosa are usually not associated with the Von Recklinghausen syndrome, and appear as unencapsulated lesions composed of a mixture of Schwann cells and fibroblasts embedded in a predominantly myxoid stroma [117, 202] .

The tumour is sessile or polypoid (Fig. 2.8a ) and is histologically benign, but has a tendency to recur and is locally destructive, causing pressure necrosis of adjacent soft tissue and bone. It may occasionally extend into paranasal sinuses, orbit and cranial fossae. It is composed of vascular and fibrous elements in varying proportions. The vessels in the superficial portions of the tumour are mainly gaping capillaries that may become compressed with increasing stromal fibrosis. Thick-walled vessels without elastic membranes and with irregular, incomplete or absent muscle coats and focal intimal thickenings are usually present in the deeper portions of the tumour. These vessels resemble those normally seen in the submucosa of the nasal conchae. The vascular elements are embedded in fibrous tissue, which varies in cellularity and collagenisation. Stellate fibroblast-like cells are often present close to the blood vessels. The fibroblastic cells of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma are strongly positive for testosterone receptors [120] . Ultrastructurally, the nuclei of angiofibroma contain characteristic dense granules [251] . Occasionally, the fibroblasts may exhibit cytologic atypia, and some of these cells may be multinucleated, but mitosis is rare. Mast cells may be numerous. There may be focal thrombosis, haemorrhage and chronic inflammatory reaction. With the advent of preoperative selective embolisation, iatrogenic emboli (Fig. 2.8b ) are increasingly encountered in resected specimens [232] . For more details on this tumour see Chap. 6.",

Due to early recognition and easy access to treatment, they usually have a more favourable prognosis than their counterpart of the sinonasal region. Sinonasal keratinising squamous cell carcinoma represents up to 45-50% of the malignant tumours of this region in several series [93, 259] . At the Hospital Clinic of the University of Barcelona, where non-keratinising squamous cell carcinomas (see Sect. 2.11.2 on cylindrical cell carcinomas) are grouped separately from keratinising squamous cell carcinomas, the latter account for only 27% of the sinonasal malignancies. They predominate in males and the great majority are seen in patients aged over 50 years. The maxillary antrum, the lateral nasal wall and the sphenoidal sinuses are the most common sites, whereas the frontal and sphenoid sinuses are rarely involved. These tumours grow by local extension, infiltrating the neighbouring structures, but lymph node metastases are rare [215] . For neoplasms circumscribed to the nasal cavity the 5-year survival is slightly above 50% [30] , whereas in neoplasms of the maxillary antrum the 5-year survival may be as low as 25% [146] . The occupational epidemiology of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma has been strongly related to exposure to nickel [141, 243, 252, 253] and to a lesser extent to chromium, isopropyl alcohol and radium [218] . As in other territories of the respiratory tract, a definite association between sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma and cigarette smoking has been documented [26, 146] . Chronic sinonasal inflammation is considered a predisposing factor. A case of carcinoma of the maxillary antrum after thorotrast exposure has been reported [97] . Nitrosamines and to a lesser extent formaldehyde are strong nasal carcinogens in laboratory rodents [44, 155] .",

They are divided into well-differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated forms. Well-differentiated carcinomas are uncommon in this territory and when encountered need to be differentiated from pseudoepitheliomatous types of hyperplasia and from verrucous carcinoma. Most conventional keratinising squamous cell carcinomas of the sinonasal tract present as moderately or poorly differentiated tumours. Special types, such as verrucous carcinoma [104] , spindle cell carcinoma [205, 276] , basaloid-squamous cell carcinoma [16, 269] and adenosquamous carcinoma [10, 94] are occasionally found in the sinonasal tract.

They may arise from the antrum, the lateral nasal wall or the ethmoid, the maxillary antrum being the most frequent site [193, 194] . They may occur concomitantly with other non-neoplastic polypoid formations. Microscopically, cylindrical cell carcinoma is composed of papillary fronds (Fig. 2.9a) , thick ribbons and polystratified masses of cells that give rise quite often to invaginations of the surface epithelium, which at low magnification may mimic inverted papilloma. The tumour cells are commonly cylindrical and have a tendency to form palisade arrangements perpendicular to the underlying basement membrane (Fig. 2.9b) . The nuclei are atypical and show increased mitotic activity, as well as abnormal mitotic figures. The pattern of invasion is usually expansive, being characterised by pushing margins with focal infiltration of the stroma. The basement membrane remains in most cases conspicuous, despite stromal infiltration, which should not be regarded as carcinoma in situ. Foci of squamous metaplasia, with transition from cylindrical to squamous epithelium, are not uncommon and when extensive these tumours may be indistinguishable from squamous cell carcinoma. This resulted in denominations such as \"transitional cell carcinoma\" and \"nonkeratinising squamous cell carcinoma\", which may be confusing. The first because the term transitional has also been applied to carcinomas of the lymphoepithelial type, and the second due to the fact that tumours called \"non-keratinising squamous cell carcinoma\" also have foci of keratinisation [267a] . In addition, the term cylindrical cell carcinoma should be preferred to non-keratinising squamous cell carcinoma because \"pure\" cylindrical cell carcinomas, without any squamous cell component, carry a better prognosis than conventional squamous cell carcinomas [84] . Very recent observations suggest a strong etiologic relationship of cylindrical cell carcinoma to high-risk human papillomavirus [69a] . A high proportion of these tumours show marked immunoreactivity for p16.",

Two cases of cylindrical cell carcinoma with endodermal sinus-like features have been reported [162] . A full examination of the resected specimen is therefore mandatory before labelling a tumour a \"pure cylindrical cell carcinoma\". The two main differential diagnoses of cylindrical cell carcinoma are the schneiderian papillomas of the inverted and oncocytic types, especially when they have concomitant carcinomatous changes. Both types of papilloma lack the atypical cellularity constantly seen in cylindrical cell carcinoma. When schneiderian papillomas coexist with cylindrical cell carcinomas, or with other types of carcinoma, the two components usually appear demarcated from one another although in contiguity. When the invaginating crypts of an inverted papilloma are filled with the cords and ribbons of a keratinising or non-keratinising squamous cell carcinoma, the lesion represents a conventional squamous cell carcinoma arising in an inverted papilloma, which implies a worse prognosis than that of cylindrical cell carcinoma.",

Cigarette smoking [86] and nickel exposure [252] have been associated with SNUC. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the deletion of the retinoblastoma gene have been ruled out as factors involved in the development of this tumour [127] . Ionising radiation is another aetiologic factor, as radiotherapy either for retinoblastoma or for nasopharyngeal carcinoma has been associated with SNUC [127] . Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma occurs in both sexes over a wide age range, with a median in the 6th decade of life. It commonly originates from the ethmoidal region as a large fungating mass. Grossly, the tumours are quite frequently extensive le-sions, obstructing the nasal cavity either unilaterally or bilaterally and invading the adjacent sinonasal structures (Fig. 2.10a) , as well as the orbit, skull base and the brain. Microscopically, SNUC is composed of small to medium-sized, undifferentiated cells, which arise via dysplastic changes from the basal cells of the surface epithelium. The cells are polygonal with distinct borders, showing round to oval, hyperchromatic or vesicular nuclei, with either inconspicuous or slightly prominent nucleoli, surrounded by a moderate amount of either amphophilic or eosinophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 2.10b ). Mitotic figures are common. The tumour forms nests, cords and sheets of cells that show frequent areas of central necrosis and tendency to vascular (Fig. 2.10c ) and perineural invasion. Ultrastructural studies demonstrate poorly formed desmosomes in quite a number of cells, while the presence of tiny bundles of tonofilaments is very rare. Neurosecretory granules are very rarely found. SNUC are immunoreactive with epithelial markers, such as CAM 5.2 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Variable reactivity can be seen with neuronspecific enolase (NSE), whereas there is negative reactivity for synaptophysin, chromogranin and other neuroendocrine markers. SNUC are also negative for EBV [48, 127] .",

Most lesions categorised in the past as grade IV ONB are now considered to be either SNUC or SCC. This is important because SNUC and SCC have a worse prognosis than ONB. In addition, SNUC needs to be distinguished from other primary sinonasal tumours, such as solid adenoid cystic carcinoma, microcytic malignant melanoma, cylindrical cell carcinoma, primary sinonasal nasopharyngeal-type undifferentiated carcinoma, lymphoma and others (Table 2. 2).",

SNUC does not arise in the nasopharynx, but bulky lesions may extend into this region. Also, NPC may extend from the nasopharynx into the sinonasal region. The distinction between these tumours can generally be made on purely histological grounds, since SNUC lacks the lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltrate seen in most cases of NPC and PSNPC. Immunohistochemistry and in All three, NPC, PSNPC, and SNUC, react positively for low molecular weight cytokeratins and EMA. In contrast, NPC and PSNPC are positive for EBV, whereas SNUC is negative. Until very recently, confusion of NPC and PSNPC with SNUC has led to the belief that some SNUC were related to EBV.

The signs and symptoms of presentation of sinonasal melanomas are not specific. Epistaxis and nasal obstruction are frequent when located in the nasal cavity. Grossly sinonasal malignant melanomas are either pigmented (black-brown) or non-pigmented (pink-tan) lesions. In the nasal cavity, they commonly arise in the anterior portion (Fig. 2.11a) of the septum and present as tan-brown polypoid formations, with occasional ulcerated and hemorrhagic areas. When arising within sinuses, they present as extensive and widely infiltrative tumours. The development of an intranasal malignant melanoma in an inverted papilloma has been reported [99] .",

Metastatic disease needs to be ruled out, before they are labelled as primary tumours. Primary melanomas may be recognised by the presence of junctional activity (Fig. 2.11c ) or by the finding of an intraepithelial component in the adjacent mucosa; nevertheless, these features are usually lost in advanced stages of the disease. Histologically, melanomas are composed of medium to large cells that may be polyhedral, round, fusiform ( Fig. 2.11b) , pleomorphic, microcytic, or a mixture of them. Usually, they have finely granular cytoplasm and nuclei with one or more eosinophilic nucleoli. Mitotic activity is prominent. A rare balloon cell variant with clear cytoplasm may mimic various types of clear cell tumours (see Chap. 5). Osteocartilaginous differentiation has also been observed [244] . The cells of sinonasal melanoma grow in solid, loosely cohesive, storiform, pseudo-alveolar or organoid patterns [25] . Two-thirds of sinonasal melanomas contain some intracytoplasmic brown pigment (Fig. 2.11d ) [25] , which has to be confirmed as melanin by Masson-Fontana or Grimelius silver stains. However, in the sinonasal tract non-pigmented melanomas are not uncommon; in our Barcelona series up to 40% of the sinonasal melanomas are amelanotic. When melanin is scarce or is not found, diagnosis may be difficult, and special techniques are mandatory. Immunohistochemically, the cells of amelanotic melanomas are negative for cytokeratin and positive for vimentin, S-100 protein and HMB-45 [65, 82, 209] , as well as anti-tyrosinase and other newly reported markers [207] . Electron microscopy reveals the presence of pre-melanosomes and/or melanosomes. The differential diagnosis of amelanotic malignant melanoma of the sinonasal tract comprises a long list of entities. Epithelioid melanomas mainly have to be distinguished from non-keratinising squamous cell carcinomas, but also from other large cell carcinomas as well as from epithelioid malignant schwannomas [76] and from metastases. Microcytic melanoma may mimic SNUC and other small round cell tumours (Table 2. 2).",

The prognostic significance of the level of local invasion, as established for cutaneous melanomas, does not apply to mucosal melanomas because of the absence of histological landmarks analogous to the papillary and reticular dermis; nevertheless, inva- sion deeper than 0.5 mm is associated with decreased survival [25] . Although many of the patients do not show initial lymph node involvement or disseminated metastases [25, 83, 107] and have stage I disease at the time of initial diagnosis, the prognosis is bad due to a high recurrence rate [250] . This recurrence appears to be related to the multicentricity of the tumours and to the anatomic characteristics of the region that preclude adequate resection, which is the treatment of choice [29, 256] . The utility of radiotherapy is controversial, but it can be of use in unresectable cases or to control recurrences [29, 95] . Immunotherapy and chemotherapy are also used for metastatic disease [256] . Five-year survival of sinonasal melanoma is reportedly under 35% [29, 250, 256] . The mean survival has not improved during the past 15 years [32] . In our Barcelona series, the 5-year survival rate of 35% is similar to that of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with primary nasal melanomas had a significantly better 5-year survival rate than patients with melanomas from other head and neck sites [154] .",

Most often, it presents a lobular arrangement with well-defined groups of tumour cells separated by abundant oedematous stroma. Less frequently, the tumour grows as diffuse sheets of cells with scanty, but highly vascular stroma. The neoplastic neuroblasts are typically small, showing round to oval nu-clei with stippled chromatin, absent or small nucleoli, and minimal cytoplasm. They are commonly separated by a neurofibrillary matrix formed by neuronal cell processes in which axons may be demonstrable by conventional silver stains. This background, seen in about 85% of ONBs, is the most helpful diagnostic feature (Fig. 2.12b) . The Homer-Wright type of rosettes is quite characteristic of ONB; however, they are less commonly seen. They form when the tumour cells surround the neurofibrillary matrix in collar-like arrangements. Even more rare are the true olfactory Flexner-Wintersteiner type of rosettes, which depict well-defined lumina lined by columnar cells resembling olfactory epithelium. These cells generally have basally located nuclei and merge with the adjacent neuroblasts without any intervening basal lamina. Perivascular pseudorosettes, formed by tumour cells arranged around capillaries, are of no diagnostic value, for they may be found in several types of neoplasms.",

The differential diagnosis of ONB includes a wide variety of small round cell tumours arising in the sinonasal region (Table 2. 2). Immunohistochemically, ONB shows diffuse positivity for NSE and synaptophysin, but is less often positive for chromogranin. In tumours with a nesting pattern, sustentacular cells are positive for S-100 protein, but generally negative for cytokeratin, although in ONB with a nesting pattern a few tumours may exhibit focal staining for low molecular weight cytokeratins. They are negative for EMA. Neurofilament protein and other markers of neural differentiation are more often expressed in tumours with diffuse, sheet-like patterns [53, 87, 246, 268] . Electron microscopy shows evidence of neuroblastic differentiation, demonstrating neuritic processes, neurotubules and membrane-bound dense-core granules [131, 159, 247] . The human analogue of achaete-scute gene (HASH1), expressed in immature olfactory neurons, is also expressed in ONB [45] . Conversely, the olfactory marker protein [182] , expressed exclusively in mature olfactory neurons, is not. ONB lacks CD 99 (MIC-2) expression, as well as the t(11;22) translocation characteristic of primary neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) [13, 263] . It also lacks the molecular genetic changes of sympathetic neuroblastoma, which, in children, may be metastatic to the sinonasal region.",

Distant metastases mainly involve bone and lung [68] . Complete surgical excision, often followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, seems to be the treatment of choice [14, 179] .

The great majority of these tumours will react strongly with antibodies against the MIC-2 (CD99) protein product (Fig. 2.13b ). This marker is of considerable value, but it is by no means specific. A growing number of other neoplasms expressing this protein have been documented. Among these are T-cell lymphomas [263] . The standard translocation t(11; 22) (q24; q12) of PNET [260] results in the fusion of the EWS-FLI1 genes.

This tumour is the most common type of sinonasal adenocarcinoma, representing about 6-13% of malignancies developing in the sinonasal tract [41, 105, 216] . Metastasis from gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma should be ruled out before a tumour is labelled as a primary of this region. These tumours are strongly associated with exposure to different types of dust, mainly hardwood, but also softwood dusts, as well as leather dust [4, 5, 47, 102, 123, 124, 142] . About 20% of sinonasal intestinal-type adenocarcinomas seem to be sporadic, without evidence of exposure to industrial dusts [4] . Grossly, they have a fungating appearance with either polypoid or papillary features. Occasionally, they may have a gelatinous consistency resembling a mucocele. The most common location is the ethmoidal region [17] . Histologically, the tumour is mainly composed of columnar mucin-secreting cells and goblet cells [17] . Some well-differentiated tumours may also contain resorptive cells, argentaffin cells and Paneth cells. Endocrine-amphicrine enteric differentiation may occasionally be found [222] . Metaplastic and atypical changes have been observed in adjacent pre-neoplastic epithelium [270] . These tumours depict different histological patterns that may be predominantly papillary, glandular, compact, mucinous or mixed [17, 23] . Papillary tumours mainly consist of elongated outgrowths lined by intestinal-type cells with markedly atypical pseudostratified nuclei (Fig. 2.14a) . Although most of them are high-grade tumours, low-grade forms (Fig. 2.14b ) mimicking colonic villous adenoma may occasionally occur [174] . The glandular pattern resembles common-type intestinal adenocarcinoma. Compact or solid forms show poorly differentiated nests of cells in which glandular formation is rarely seen. In the mucinous pattern, more than 50% of the tumour is composed of dilated mucin-filled glands lined by columnar mucin-secreting epithelium, and lakes of mucin containing fragmented epithelial elements (Fig. 2.14c ). Other mucinous tumours show mucin-filled cells with the pattern of \"signet-ring\" cell carcinoma. Various attempts have been made to correlate histopathological grading and typing with clinical behaviour [78, 81, 140] .",

Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy have confirmed the enteric differentiation of the tumour cells [24] . These tumours are positive for a wide spectrum of cytokeratin markers, whereas they are only occasionally positive for carcinoembryonic antigen [166] . Intestinal-type adenocarcinomas are frequently but not always positive for cytokeratin 7, while most express cytokeratin 20 and CDX-2, two markers related to intestinal differentiation [79] . The prognosis for high-grade intestinal-type adenocarcinoma is poor.

            "text": "Non-salivary-type low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinomas are a distinctive group of tumours comprising well-differentiated tubular or papillary structures, or a combination of both. They are lined by a single layer of cuboidal or columnar cells that display uniform round or oval nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, minimal cytologic atypia and scarce mitotic figures. They are locally infiltrative and have a tendency towards local recurrence [113] . Different histological patterns may be recognised: papillary, glandular, mucinous, trabecular, cribriform and clear cell. The papillary pattern is characterised by complex papillary fronds lined by bland columnar cells that may occasionally mimic oncocytic (columnar) cell papilloma. Quite similar tumours also develop in the nasopharynx [267] . The glandular pattern may simulate adenoma; nevertheless, the presence of closely packed glands, forming back-to-back arrangements, indicates the true malignant nature. Mucinous tumours have to be distinguished from mucoceles and from mucinous adenocarcinoma of intestinal or salivary type [20, 224] . The trabecular pattern may resemble acinic cell carcinoma [200] . The cribriform arrangements have to be distinguished from low-grade salivary duct carcinoma of salivary glands [62] . The clear cell type has to be separated from the salivary-type tumours with clear cells and from metastatic renal cell carcinoma [31, 280] . A tubulopapillary variant has recently been reported (Fig. 2.15 ) [234] that has to be differentiated from terminal tubulus adenocarcinoma of the nasal seromucous glands [139] .",

Sinonasal B-cell lymphomas lack epitheliotropism, polymorphous cell infiltrate, angiocentricity, prominent necrosis, and fibrosis.

Until quite recently, non-B cell sinonasal lymphomas were considered as other forms of T-cell lymphoma, frequently displaying angiocentricity. Patients may present either with an obstructive mass or with mid-facial destructive lesions. Histologically, an angiocentric and angiodestructive infiltrate with extensive necrosis (Fig. 2.17a) is frequently seen. In NK/T-cell lymphoma, cells may be small, medium-sized, large, or anaplastic, and may show a conspicuous admixture of inflammatory cells. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the covering epithelium may occur [49] . NK/T cell lymphoma is almost always associated with EBV positivity. The most typical immunophenotypes are CD2+, CD56+ (Fig. 2.17b) , surface CD3-, and cytoplasmic CD3epsilon+. Most cases are also positive for cytotoxic granule-associated proteins (granzyme B, TIA-1 and perforin). They are usually negative for other T and NKcell associated markers. Sinonasal lymphomas demonstrating CD3epsilon+, CD56-, cytotoxic molecule+, and EBV+ are also included within the NK/T category. The commonest cytogenetic abnormality found in NK/Tcell lymphoma is the 6q-22-23 deletion [233] . The prognosis of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma is variable. Some patients respond well to therapy and others die of disease despite aggressive therapy [52] .",

There is a male predominance and symptoms are non-specific with nasal obstruction and epistaxis produced by a nasal cavity mass ( Fig. 2.19a ) [112] . Histologically, sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma (SNTCS) comprises a multiplicity of cell types of varying maturity (Fig. 2.19b) . The epithelial component includes keratinising squamous epithelium, pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium and glandular structures lined by cuboidal and columnar cells including mucus cells. Masses of immature epithelial cells, some containing glycogen or mucin, are frequently found. \"Foetal-appearing\" clear cell squamous epithelium is a common finding and a very important diagnostic clue for some authors [112] . Neuroepithelial elements with rosettes and neuroblastoma-like areas are in most instances present. These epithelial and neuroepithelial elements occur in close relationship with each other and with mesenchymal elements, the most prominent of which are immature cells with oval or elongated nuclei. The mesenchymal cells may exhibit skeletal muscle differentiation with cross striations (Fig. 2.19c) . Foci of cartilage, smooth muscle, adipose tissue and fibrovascular tissues may also be present. In spite of the common occurrence of areas having a variety of mature tissues, mitotic activity and cytological features of malignancy are demonstrable in the undifferentiated areas of both the epithelial and mesenchymal elements [75] .",

In contradistinction to malignant gonadal teratomas, which are frequently found in patients at a younger age, sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma does not contain areas of embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma or germinoma (seminoma), as seen in many germ cell tumours. This makes a germ cell origin of SNTCS unlikely [112] . The histogenesis of sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma is debatable. The presence of neural tissue in these neoplasms raises the possibility that the origin could be in some way related to the olfactory membrane, or alternatively to the sinonasal membrane as a whole, since the olfactory membrane also develops from it [112] .",
