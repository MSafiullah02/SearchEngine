Circulation of free thrombin, uncontrolled by natural anticoagulants, can activate platelets and lead to thrombosis.2 Although ischaemic stroke has been recognised as a complication of COVID-19 (usually with severe disease),3 the mechanisms and phenotype are not yet understood. Our observations suggest that acute ischaemic stroke accompanying Covid-19 infection may have distinct characteristics, with implications for diagnosis and treatment. All patients had large-vessel occlusion; in three these were in multiple territories. In two patients (1 and 2) one recurrent stroke and one initial ischaemic stroke, respectively, occurred despite therapeutic anticoagulation. Two patients had concurrent venous thromboembolism. Five patients had very high D-dimer levels (>7000 \u00b5g/L), substantially higher than the median level reported in COVID-19 (900 \u00b5g/L);3 the D-dimer for patient 6 was 1080 \u00b5g/L after intravenous thrombolysis. In five of six patients, ischaemic stroke occurred 8\u201324 days after Covid-19 symptom onset, and in one patient during the presymptomatic phase, suggesting that COVID-19 associated ischaemic stroke is usually delayed, but can occur both early and later in the course of the disease.",
