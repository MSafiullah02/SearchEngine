The animals were then intubated with an endotracheal tube having a 7.5-mm internal diameter (Mallinckrodt Inc; St. Louis, MO) and maintained with isoflurane inhalation anesthesia, using intermittent propofol injections for any evidence of discomfort or awakening. The animals were placed on a mechanical ventilator (Dual Phase Control Respirator Pump; Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA) with a tidal volume of 10 to 15 mL/kg and a rate of 12 to 15 breaths/min. Prior to subjecting the animal to hypoxia, the respiratory rate was occasionally adjusted in an effort to maintain a neutral pH, as determined by arterial blood gas measurements. ECG leads were placed in the standard three-lead positions on each animal, starting at the time of induction, and were continuously monitored throughout the experiment. Oxygen saturation was also measured with a pulse oximeter (Vet/Ox Plus 4700; SDI; Waukesha, WI) with the probe placed on the tongue of the animal. Once under general anesthesia and in the supine position, a cervical cut down was performed through which a Swan-Ganz right heart catheter (Edwards Lifesciences; Irvine, CA) was placed via the internal jugular vein, and an 18-gauge angiocatheter was placed in the common carotid artery for access to the central arterial system for BP monitoring and arterial blood gas measurements. Both of these lines were transduced using a pressure-monitoring kit with a pressure transducer (TruWave; Edwards Lifesciences) that was connected to a monitor system (model 78834A; Hewlett-Packard; Palo Alto, CA) for monitoring the systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures and the central venous pressure.",

After passing through the filter, the outflow drained by gravity into a custom built 10-L glass tank (Advanced Aquatanks; Los Angeles, CA). The outflow of the filter was placed 41 cm below the level of the operating table. A ceramic plate diffuser (Aquaculture Technology; Kitzbuhel, Austria) was placed at the bottom of the collection tank. This diffuser was designed for oxygenating ponds and gives off a steady stream of 10 to 200 \u03bcm bubbles when being infused with oxygen at 30 pounds per square inch (psi) [based on product information from the company]. This diffuser was connected to a medical oxygen tank via one quarter inch (internal diameter) tubing (Gish Biomedical).

This outflow from the roller pump passed into a 43-cm length of one quarter inch tubing. This tubing was connected to the inflow end of a heat exchanger (ECMOtherm-II; Avecor; Minneapolis, MN). The heat exchanger was set to warm the abdominal perfusate to 39\u00b0C, which is normal body temperature for swine. This was accomplished using a circulatory heater (Haake; Berlin, Germany). After being warmed by the heat exchanger, the abdominal perfusate passed through a 63-cm length of one quarter inch tubing to the 28F inflow catheter. All tubing was standard cardiopulmonary bypass tubing. Thus, the circuit was as follows: abdomen, outflow catheter, filter, reservoir with oxygenator, pump, warmer, inflow catheter, and abdomen.",

Any perfusion circuit that is dependent on a siphon phenomenon for outflow may require manipulation of the outflow catheter to achieve optimal flow due to local geometric factors that can obstruct or occlude the catheter drainage ports. Through trial and error, we found that placing the outflow cannula above the liver yielded the fewest drainage problems. With the cannula in this location, it was never necessary to reopen the incision, but occasionally it was necessary to spin the catheter or move it several centimeters in or out to assure optimal flow.",

This rate was empirically determined and unique for each animal, falling between 1.2 and 4.2 L/min (Table 2\n). Once optimization of the circuit was complete and the maximum flow rate for that animal was identified, the outflow catheter was clamped and the abdomen was allowed to fill with 5 to 7 L of fluid. Once this volume was infused into the abdomen, the inflow catheter was then clamped, thereby trapping the perfusate in the abdomen. In designing this model, we found that this maneuver, which did not affect the intraabdominal pressure, was necessary in order to assure that the siphon would resume and that the circuit could be restarted after having been stopped for several hours during the stepwise hypoxia portion of the experiments. Thus, in every case there was a large volume of perfusate, saline solution, or perfluorocarbon harbored in the abdomen during the collection of the \u201ccircuit-off\u201d hypoxia measurements.",

Thirty minutes was an arbitrarily selected interval based on clinical observations that this interval would be sufficient to allow equilibration with a change in mechanical ventilation parameters. This time frame was also necessary due to the logistical constraints of the animal facility to keep the experiments to < 8 h. The desired Fio2 was achieved by empirically adjusting the blend of nitrogen and oxygen to achieve the desired Fio2, as indicated by the in-line gas monitor (Datex; Puritan-Bennett Corporation).",

The volume of perfusate that remained in the abdomen during perfusion was also idiosyncratic, remained relatively stable with a stable flow rate, and ranged from 2 to 3 L.

This method appropriately accounts for unbalanced data due to occasional missing measurements, as well as for the correlation of measurements obtained on the same animal.

The relative ease with which oxygenation can be increased in small-animal models, but not large-animal models, is likely a function of the significantly increased ratio of the peritoneal surface to body mass in small animals.22 Based on our results, we hypothesize that a perfusion circuit, with a medium like perfluorocarbon that is capable of carrying and unloading large quantities of oxygen, is necessary to achieve significant gas exchange through the peritoneal surface of a large animal.",

Our hypothesis to explain this consistent finding is that the volume of indwelling perfluorocarbon in the abdomen likely served as an oxygen reservoir and resulted in blunting of the induced hypoxia effect on arterial oxygen concentrations as the Fio2 was decreased from 18 to 10%. Although we were unable to directly measure the oxygen content of the perfluorocarbon, the perfluorocarbon would have initially equilibrated with atmospheric air, a Po2 of approximately 160 mm Hg, and could have held as much as 2.5 to 3.5 L of available oxygen.14\n15\n16\n17 Given the rapidity with which gradient-driven gasses dissolve in perfluorocarbons and the fact that tissues extract essentially all oxygen from perfluorocarbons before extracting oxygen from hemoglobin, one would assume that the dwelling perfluorocarbon served as a renewable oxygen reservoir as the animals were rendered progressively hypoxic.23 That is, in addition to serving as an initial oxygen reservoir, it is likely that the reservoir was relatively \u201crenewed\u201d as the animals progressed from higher to lower levels of inspired oxygen. For example, if an animal was at an Fio2 level of 16%, the perfluorocarbon would equilibrate to the tissues at this level and would then be higher than the tissue levels when the Fio2 was decreased to 14%, thereby serving as a source of oxygen at the 14% Fio2 level.",

Our experiments were designed to ferret out any potential effect from peritoneal perfusion. To magnify the effect from a gradient-driven phenomenon, we elected to drop the animals to the profound level of hypoxia induced by ventilating them with an Fio2 of 10%. In retrospect, this degree of hypoxia is clinically irrelevant and likely placed the animals into a state of oxygen debt from which they could never recover during the ascending phase of the induced hypoxia measurements Fig 1. It is our hypothesis that this state of oxygen debt at the conclusion of the experiments is why all the animals demonstrated their highest levels of oxygenation at the beginning of the experiments, when they first entered a state of induced hypoxia Fig 2. We also feel that the parallel sequence of induced hypoxia increase and decrease, for both the saline solution and perfluorocarbon groups, is why the resulting data yielded parallel lines Fig 2 for perfusate that was dwelling in the abdomen and perfusate that was circulating. Although the results of our principle experiments demonstrate that arterial oxygenation can be supplemented by instilling perfluorocarbon into the abdomen, partially with dwelling and more so by circulating oxygenated perfluorocarbon, it is important to view these results within the context of the short duration of the experiments, the peculiarities of our induced hypoxia model, and the statistically significant, but relatively small, sample size of our study.",

Although supplemental oxygenation has been demonstrated in small animals (with their relatively larger peritoneal surface) by using various techniques to oxygenate the abdominal cavity, this is the first demonstration of investigators being able to consistently accomplish this objective in a large animal. Further studies are indicated and will take the form of longer duration peritoneal perfusion runs to look for toxic side effects of this treatment, the evaluation of the impact of this technique on carbon dioxide clearance, the performance of this technique in disease models that simulate human conditions of severe pulmonary failure, and the exploration of interventions that can enhance gas exchange across the peritoneal membrane. We speculate that this technique could potentially find a role in the supportive care of patients with profound, but reversible, pulmonary failure.
