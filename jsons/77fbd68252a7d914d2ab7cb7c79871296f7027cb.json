All rights reserved Abstract: Background. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic factors associated with and treatments for late-onset severe pneumonia (LOSP) in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Methods. Fifty consecutive patients who underwent non-T-celldepleted allo-HSCT at the Peking University Institute of Hematology and met the criterion of LOSP after allo-HSCT were enrolled. Results. The median time from allo-HSCT to the occurrence of LOSP was 231 (90-1487) days. Twenty-eight patients harbored 1 or more pathogens (infectious LOSP, I-LOSP), whereas 22 did not harbor any pathogens (non-infectious LOSP, NI-LOSP). The 100-day survival rate of LOSP patients was 31.1%. Patients smoking before allo-HSCT (0% vs. 35.4%, P = 0.002) and male gender (20.0% vs. 61.9%, P = 0.026) had lower 100-day survival rate. Patients with a lower bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophil percentage had higher 100-day survival rate relative to those with higher BALF neutrophil percentage (45.5% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.012). The 100-day survival rate of patients with I-LOSP was lower than that of patients with NI-LOSP (19.1% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.043). Patients given late (\u22651 week after LOSP diagnosis) and low-dose methylprednisolone (MP) therapy (\u22642 mg/kg/day) had the best 100-day survival rate. In the multivariate analysis, nonsmoking before allo-HSCT and late and low-dose MP therapy were significantly associated with a better survival after LOSP. Conclusion. LOSP is a severe complication after allo-HSCT. The correct timing and corticosteroid dosage in the context of broadspectrum antimicrobial therapy might further improve the outcomes of patients with LOSP.",

Although transplant techniques have progressed significantly, treatment-related mortality continues to seriously influence the survival of patients who have undergone allo-HSCT, and severe pulmonary complications are considered among the worst complications associated with this procedure. Infectious and non-infectious pulmonary complications are found in 68% and 29% of HSCT recipients, respectively (1) . Severe pulmonary complications, therefore, account for a significant percentage of deaths after transplantation.",

As increasing numbers of patients achieve long-term survival, further attention should be given to late-onset pulmonary complications (\u22653 months after transplantation). Chen et al. (3) observed that during a median follow-up of 2 years, 25% of patients developed at least 1 episode of pneumonia after transplantation, and the cumulative incidence of a first pneumonia episode at 4 years ranged from 18% to 39%. We observed that some patients suffered from acute severe pneumonia >3 months after allo-HSCT and that these patients had some common features, such as rapid progression, an absence of pathogens, and high mortality. Liu et al. (4) reported a study of 20 patients who experienced lateonset severe pneumonia (LOSP) after allo-HSCT. The incidence of LOSP was 1.3%; among the affected patients, only 8 tested positive for pathogens, and 11 died despite receiving comprehensive therapy. It has been suggested that LOSP might be a severe complication affecting the clinical outcomes of allo-HSCT recipients. However, relatively few studies have addressed the prognostic factors associated with and treatments for LOSP after allo-HSCT.",

            "text": "In this study, blood and/or BALF samples from 28 of the 50 patients were positive for pathogens, indicating that infection may be an important cause of LOSP. Chen et al. (3) also observed that infection was an important cause of late-onset pneumonia after allo-HSCT. In addition, pathogens were not detected in 22 patients and most of them might thus meet the diagnostic criteria for IPS (18) , suggesting that alloimmune reactions play an important role in the development of LOSP (19) . However, Seo et al. (20) reported that more than half of the patients previously diagnosed with IPS were found to harbor pathogens according to currently available diagnostic methods, which suggests that infection remains the most important cause of LOSP. In addition, most infectious agents can trigger autoimmunity via different mechanisms (21) , and many studies have observed that infections, particularly the viral infections, can trigger a graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction (22) (23) (24) . Therefore, we suggest that the immune reactions in patients with NI-LOSP might also have occult infectious etiologies. Although some pathogens detected in BALF likely represent the shedding of pulmonary pathogens rather than invasive disease (25), we observed higher CMV and EBV loads in BALF than in plasma. Patients with LOSP might be too ill to undergo further invasive examinations (e.g., biopsy for histological confirmation). In addition, Seo et al. (20) observed that IPS patients with detectable pathogens had a significantly worse 100-day OS rate, compared to patients without pathogens, which was in accordance with our results. Therefore, the correct method of identifying pathogens from blood and/or BALF might be critical to improving the outcomes of patients with LOSP. We observed that the median duration from LOSP diagnosis to death was 29 days. We also observed that the median value of oxygenation index was <200, and as high as 62% (31/50) of the LOSP patients need mechanical ventilation. It is suggested that LOSP progresses rapidly and acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in most of the patients. Therefore, our strategy of empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy administration was reasonable. In addition, we observed that the initial corticosteroid therapy dosage and timing were associated with the outcomes of patients with LOSP; notably, early and high-dose MP therapy did not improve the outcomes. The hypothesized benefit gained from corticosteroid administration for severe pneumonia might be due to reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, downregulated leukocyte adhesion protein expression, and the prevention of excessive alveolar collagen deposition (26) . However, infection may be an important cause of LOSP, and highdose MP did not help to eliminate the pathogens; additionally secondary infections might associate with high-dose MP therapy. Many studies found that lowdose corticosteroid therapy may improve the outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia (27, 28) . In a systematic review by Lamontagne et al. (29) , treatment with a corticosteroid dosage equivalent to \u22642 mg/kg/ day of MP was associated with lower hospital mortality in patients with severe pneumonia, and Tang et al. (30) found that an MP dosage of 0.5-2.5 mg/kg/day or the equivalent was associated with improved mortality and morbidity outcomes without increased adverse reactions in patients with severe pneumonia. We observed better survival rates among patients with LOSP treated with low-dose MP (\u22642 mg/kg/day). In addition, as mentioned above, immune reactions, which might also have occult infectious etiologies, could play an important role in the development of LOSP. Although Meduri et al. (28) observed that MP used in early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with significant improvement in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction and reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, we observed that patients receiving MP therapy within 1 week after LOSP diagnosis had poor outcomes. We speculate that early MP therapy might lead to a loss of infection control and may thus worsen the situation. In cases of LOSP after allo-HSCT, wherein pathogens were cleared using effective anti-infection treatments but infection-related immune reactions remained, corticosteroid therapy could improve patient outcomes. Thus, this is an important finding and underscores that corticosteroid therapy should not be used in all patients with LOSP after allo-HSCT.",

(4) observed that among 6 patients with LOSP who received DLI, 3 survived until the end of follow-up. However, in our study, DLI did not improve the outcomes of patients with LOSP. We speculated that DLI could trigger GVH effects, which might exacerbate immune-related lung injuries, and could also lead to myelosuppression and secondary infection.",

This might be a result of the higher frequency of smokers among male patients (i.e., all smokers in this study were male), as smoking before HSCT was an independent risk factor for worse survival in our multivariate analysis. In addition, patients with a higher BALF neutrophil percentage had a worse OS. Several studies observed that a higher BALF neutrophil percentage was associated with a poor outcome in both infectious and non-infectious lung injury patients (32) (33) (34) . It has therefore been suggested that overzealous neutrophil activation might result in severe alveolar damage resulting from the release of cytotoxic and immune cell-activating agents (35) .",

First, this was a retrospective study with a relatively small number of patients with LOSP, which might have influenced the accuracy of our findings. Second, we might have underestimated the occurrence of I-LOSP in this study because the number of pathogens that could be tested was relatively small. Third, we could not detect the loads of viruses except for CMV and EBV, and therefore, we could not further identify the association between the virus load and the outcomes of LOSP. Finally, the large number of different treatments administered to treat patients in both the I-LOSP and NI-LOSP groups introduced heterogeneity to our justification of the generic conclusion regarding the advantage given by late and low-dose MP therapy with respect to the clinical outcomes of patients with LOSP. Future prospective and multicenter studies will provide more information about the prognostic factors and treatments of LOSP after allo-HSCT.",
