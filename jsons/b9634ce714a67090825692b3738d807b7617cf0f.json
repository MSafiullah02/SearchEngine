Within the Vesivirus genus, serotypes of marine origin form a polyphyletic grouping distinct from those designated feline caliciviruses (FCVs) [Berke et al., 1997] . Vesivirus cycles naturally in oceanic reservoirs and a single Vesivirus serotype has infected species as diverse as fish, seals, shellfish, swine, cattle, and primates, including humans, and caused disease, sometimes severe, in marine and domesticated food-producing animals and humans [Smith et al., 1998a,b] . Classical virologic investigations established that epidemics of vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) in North America from 1932 through 1959 were caused by serotypes of marine origin [Smith et al., , 1980b Smith, 2000] . The VESV epidemic serotypes (N \u00bc 13) are closely related to serotypes (N > 25) of San Miguel sea lion viruses (SMSVs) also of ocean origin and the few other Vesivirus serotypes (N \u00bc 5) isolated from terrestrial animals since 1970 [Smith et al., , 1980b Smith and Boyt, 1990; Neill et al., 1995 Neill et al., , 1998 Matson et al., 1996; Reid et al., 1999; Smith, 2000] . Viruses in the marine environment other than caliciviruses also are being discovered, a recent example being the characterization of four possibly new virus families related to caliciviruses at a high taxonomic level [Culley et al., 2003; Lang et al., 2004] . Of interest, the VESV epidemics were controlled, in part, by cooking of raw garbage containing fish and pork scraps fed to swine [Smith et al., , 1980b Smith and Boyt, 1990] .",

The human cases of marine Vesivirus disease which were described previously occurred in association with the North Pacific Basin, one in a laboratory scientist working with a marine Vesivirus who experienced a disseminated vesicular exanthem and the second in a field biologist working with marine mammals who had a vesicular exanthem on the face [Smith et al., 1998a] . One strain recovered from these human cases was by genome sequence related most closely to SMSV-5, the serotype known to infect more than 20 animal species and cause different clinical manifestations in them [Smith et al., 1977 [Smith et al., , 1980a [Smith et al., , 1998b Barlough et al., 1986] . The other strain from a human case was of a new Vesivirus serotype. To assess whether Vesivirus infections are more widespread among humans, the seroprevalence against Vesivirus and possible Vesivirus viremia were examined in adults whose donated blood was tested at a northwest-U.S. regional blood laboratory and, because of initial results, in patients with clinical hepatitis of unknown etiology.",

One sample set included blood cleared for donation after clinical and laboratory screening, which included negative test results for hepatitis B surface and core antigens, HIV-1 and 2, HIV P24 antigen, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2, hepatitis C antigen, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels below 120 International Units (IU). A second, concurrently acquired set of sequential blood specimens was collected from donors whose pre-donation laboratory values differed from the first set only in that the ALT level was 120 IU. Based upon testing of these two sets of samples, three additional sets of sera from cases of clinical hepatitis were acquired from an industry source. Two of these sets represented hepatitis cases of unknown but suspected infectious cause. Both were negative for known hepatitis viruses, but differed from each other in that some cases were associated with transfusion or dialysis. Other samples came from hepatitis cases caused by hepatitis B or C virus. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the authors' institutions.",

The OD values of antigennegative (N) wells were 0.005 and most were 0.000. The cut-point for positivity was a P-N 0.043.

The retesting also yielded a higher mean P-N value among positive samples in the high ALT donors for antibody to the SMSV pool (P < 0.001), but not for antibody to F9. Sera from 51 cases of clinical hepatitis had a yet higher estimated prevalence (25%) of anti-SMSV pool antibody [Dean et al., 1994] . and mean P-N value among positive samples. When these hepatitis cases were analyzed by subgroup, the highest prevalence (47%) of antibody to the SMSV pool was in the cases of Non-A-E hepatitis associated with transfusion or dialysis. Cases of Non-A-E hepatitis with an unknown exposure source had an estimated prevalence (19%) similar to that (21%) of the high ALT donors and cases of HBV or HCV hepatitis had an estimated prevalence (10%) similar to that of healthy donors. The increase of anti-SMSV pool prevalence along the axis ''Normal donor-high ALT donor-Non-A-E hepatitis case associated with transfusion or dialysis'' was highly significant (P < 0.001, w 2 for the trend). The mean P-N value of the positive samples from the Non-A-E hepatitis group was lower than that of the other groups studied (P > 0.05 for these comparisons).",

SMSV Vesivirus are widely distributed in marine and some terrestrial animals and may routinely ''traffic'' among these hosts, cycling from their large marine reservoirs onto land and perhaps back again. An ocean presence has been established by the isolation of virus, the presence of specific neutralizing antibodies, or by genome amplification and sequencing for 43 of the 46 known serotypes of the genus Vesivirus, including serotypes isolated initially from terrestrial hosts and named feline (FCV), primate (PCV Pan-1), bovine (BCV Bos-1), reptilian (RCV Cro-1), swine (VESV-A 48 -K 56 ), mink (MCV), and human (SMSV-5 Hom-1 and HuCV Hom-1) caliciviruses [Evermann et al., 1983; Smith et al., 1983 Smith et al., , 1998a Smith et al., ,b, 2002b Seal et al., 1995; Reid et al., 1999] .

Vesivirus has been recovered at titers of 10 7 infectious virions per gram of spleen in naturally and experimentally infected opal-eye fish (Girella nigricans). These fish are resident along the Southern California coast [Smith et al., 1980a [Smith et al., ,b, 1981 and are a sports and commercial fish and a common food source for seals, some of which also have extensive migration cycle. Seals reproduce on land or ice, where Vesivirus-induced reproductive failure and death occur, where foraging scavengers can further redistribute the viruses into terrestrial ecosystems, and where exposure to Vesivirus likely occurred for one human case [Smith et al., 1998a] . The present findings indicate a broader potential for Vesivirus infection and, perhaps, illness in humans than previously recognized. The strains causing viremia and to which antibody was detected in this study are similar to the Vesivirus with an ocean reservoir. A finding of subclinical viremia and the detected highest seroprevalence in cases of clinical hepatitis associated with transfusion or dialysis suggest that blood exposure that may have led to hepatitis also could lead to higher exposure to Vesivirus. If Vesivirus causes hepatitis in humans, then an estimated rate for such causation can be derived from the study findings, as follows: the rate of 10 of 91 donors amplicon-positive in the serum who also had elevated serum liver transaminases (ALT) values, together with the rate of high ALT values occurring in about 1 in 1,000 blood donors, would correspond to a rate of 1 in 10,000 blood donors who might have active, subclinical Vesivirus hepatitis. The association of higher anti-Vesivirus antibody prevalence with clinical hepatitis of unknown etiology would require further study. The finding of Vesivirus viremia in otherwise normal blood donors indicates that blood exposure to caliciviruses of the genus Vesivirus could occur by multiple routes of exposure. The diversity of host species, mechanisms of exposure and tissue tropisms for Vesivirus with the findings of this study suggest additional Vesivirus disease manifestations might be found in humans with further investigation.",
