Antibodies directed to binding sites for HRV-A and -B failed to inhibit HRV-C attachment, consistent with the alternative receptor footprint. HRV-A and HRV-B infected HeLa and WisL cells but HRV-C did not. However, HRV-C RNA synthesized in vitro and transfected into both cell types resulted in cytopathic effect and recovery of functional virus, indicating that the viral attachment mechanism is a primary distinguishing feature of HRV-C.",

They share a common genome organization, and isolates are typically classified into one of three species (A, B and C) according to phylogenetic sequence criteria 1 . HRV is the most frequent cause of the common cold, but recent data have shown that HRV infection has pathogenic potential beyond rhinosinusitis. It is now recognized that 50-85% of asthma exacerbations are due to HRV infections [2] [3] [4] , and wheezing illnesses in infancy caused by HRV are associated with a high risk of developing childhood asthma 5 . HRV infections of all types are major contributors to morbidity associated with exacerbations of other chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 6,7 . Recently, partial or full genome sequencing has been used to place clinical isolates within the 99 types of HRV-A and HRV-B. However, some cases, often associated with children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract disease, began to appear where the identified HRV sequences were not consistent with those of known HRV types [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Full-genome sequencing has shown the distinct nature of these HRVs, which are now designated as HRV-C 1, 15, 16 . The pathogenesis and antigenic variability associated with HRV-C, the mechanism of viral attachment to host cells and potential treatments have been elusive because, unlike HRV-A and HRV-B, HRV-C has not been successfully propagated in any cell type in vitro 17 .",

Notably, HRVs have great plasticity and rapid evolution, as demonstrated by the adaptation of major-group HRV (A89) to use another receptor (heparan sulfate) for cell entry 20 . We were therefore interested in determining whether HRV-C has sequence consistency in the same sites as receptor footprints mapped for HRV-A and HRV-B [21] [22] [23] [24] . For each alignment position harboring known contacts for ICAM-1 (HRV-B14, HRV-A16 or human coxsackievirus A21) or LDLR (HRV-A2), we recorded the group amino acid populations and then compared them (as groups or internally and pairwise, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). When we compared the ICAM-1 binders among themselves, about 40% of identified footprint positions showed strong (r > 0.6) composition conservation (for example, Thr180 in VP3 of HRV-B14 (14-T-3-180)). Some of these positions were conserved among all HRVs (for example, B14-P-1-155 and A16-G-1-148). In contrast, other sites showed a compositional bias between receptor groups (for example, B14-P-3-178). Figure 4a depicts the most abundant residues at each footprint position when the HRV-A and HRV-B sequences were subdivided by ICAM-1 and LDLR receptor groups and compared to the HRV-C sequences. There was little commonality between HRV-C and either the ICAM-1 or the LDLR contact points. For example, six of seven LDLR footprint positions and 47 of 50 ICAM-1 footprint locations were rejected by both statistical methods as compositional matches to the HRV-C (Supplementary Table 2) . Overall, the analysis predicts the HRV-C viruses use a different receptor with a distinct compositional footprint from HRV-A and HRV-B viruses.",

To test this hypothesis, we developed a plasmid (pC15) for cell transfection (as opposed to viral infection) by cloning a full-length cDNA copy of the HRV-C15 genome into the plasmid vector pMJ3 (ref. 29 ) directly downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter ( Supplementary  Fig. 2) . The cloned HRV-C15 sequence was identical to the complete genome sequence of passage four HRV-C15 (Fig. 1d) and contained a 3\u2032-end poly(A 29 ) tail. , A62  A31, A47  A10, A66, A77, A100  A40, A54, A56, A59, A63, A85, A98  A11, A18, A21, A24, A33, A34, A50  A55, A57, A76, A90  A38, A60   A2, A23, A30, A49  A13, A42, A61, A73, A96  A43, A75  A9, A15, A32, A67, . 5a) . After transfection of lower doses of RNA, only HRV-A16 RNA caused CPE progression over time, confirming that the newly synthesized HRV-C15 virus cannot spread from transfected cells to neighboring (not transfected) cells (Supplementary Fig. 3) . We inoculated HRV-C15 virus recovered 24 h after transfection (1 \u00d7 10 9 vRNA copies per ml) into mucosal organ cultures, and the growth kinetics of progeny virus (Fig. 5b) was similar to those of the parental HRV-C15 (Fig. 1e) . Examination of concentrated cell lysates by electron microscopy revealed intact HRV virions (about 30 nm in diameter) as well as the expected empty capsids (Fig. 5c) .",

Since 2006, over 60 types of this species have been implicated in both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, particularly in children and in individuals with chronic respiratory diseases 31 . We employed human organ culture of sinus mucosa to propagate in vitro and study the basic biologic properties of an HRV-C clinical isolate (C15 type). Virus replication was demonstrated by an increase in viral RNA, which localized to focal areas in epithelial cell layers. The high-titer virus obtained after serial passage in sinus organ culture allowed complete genome sequencing and cloning of the full-length cDNA copy of the HRV-C15 genome into a plasmid vector. RNA transcripts synthesized in vitro from this clone were infectious when transfected into cell lines resistant to HRV-C15 infection, providing an efficient system for production of recombinant HRV-C. 208  209  210  213  232  241  434  436  439  440  443  527  528  529  530  535  579  686  704  705  711  713  769  770  773  775  821  832  833  834  835  836  840  841  844  847  915  916  917  918  924  687  689  690  753  856  858 )   205  206  207  208  209  210  213  232  241  434  436  439  440  443  527  528  529  530  535  579  686  704  705  711  713  769  770  773  775  821  832  833  834  835  836  840  841  844  847  915  916  917  918 Our experimental findings and bioinformatic predictions indicate unique HRV-C receptor-binding specificity. Mucosal organ culture is the only model to date that supports HRV-C infection in vitro. We and others have tried to grow these newly discovered rhinoviruses from numerous NLF samples in multiple cell cultures without success, indicating unique growth requirements 10, 15, 16 . Moreover, our attempts to adapt high-titer HRV-C15 virus grown in sinus cultures or recombinant virus from transfected cells to a cell line were not successful. HRV-C replication in sinus tissue seems to be limited to the epithelium, and hybridization signals were associated with both nonciliated and ciliated cells. The degree of virus amplification (high or low virus yields) showed considerable variability, which could be related to the condition of the epithelium (all specimens were from individuals with sinusitis), other underlying diagnoses (for example, allergy or asthma) or perhaps the status of local innate immune elements. Furthermore, the expression of HRV-C-specific receptors on epithelial cells may depend on factors found in vivo such as microbial products or interactions with other types of cells (for example, dendritic cells or lymphocytes) present in human airways.",

Sequence comparisons within the mapped receptor footprints show variability and a tendency toward a species-specific compositional bias among ICAM-1 binders 32 . However, amino acid residues corresponding to the documented ICAM-1 footprint have been shown to clearly classify the two receptor groups 33 . The LDLR binders are harder to define by sequence. They always have a conserved central lysine (for example, in HRV-A2 VP1 it is Lys224) , but this residue is not unique to LDLR binders, and predictive modeling instead suggests that the overall binding specificity primarily relies on a favorable combination of charge complementarities and hydrophobic interactions 34 . Comparisons of the group amino acid populations of the all known ICAM-1 or LDLR contact residues using two correlation metrics (Spearman and Pearson) revealed that the majority of footprint locations were rejected by both methods as compositional matches to the HRV-C, suggesting that an alternate receptor is used by these viruses. In agreement with this analysis, very low amounts of HRV-C15 attached to HeLa and PBE cells, and incubation of mucosal organ cultures with blocking antibodies to major and minor HRV receptors showed no effects on HRV-C15 binding.",

HRV-C15 binds to an unknown receptor that is expressed on epithelial cells in differentiated tissues but is either absent or underexpressed in many cell lines and is clearly distinct from receptors used by other HRV species. It is possible that the lack of knowledge about the HRV-C receptor and the virus's biology has impeded the development of effective antivirals for HRV, as previous candidate medications were tested only against HRV-A and HRV-B viruses before moving into clinical trials. Even though not all enterovirus species have VP1 motifs that confer susceptibility to capsid binding agents, our results show that this approach can be used to block HRV-C binding and replication. Thus, these studies provide evidence that there are at least two feasible approaches to the treatment or prevention of HRV infections; refinement of capsid binding agents that target multiple species and development of competitive antagonists for the HRV receptors. The availability of organ culture and reverse genetics system should greatly facilitate further studies on HRV-C biology and its receptor identification.",

All protocols for these studies were reviewed and approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board. We obtained residual airway tissue specimens from individuals with chronic sinusitis undergoing endoscopic surgery (informed consent was not required, as the specimens would otherwise have been discarded after surgery). We washed, sectioned (4 \u00d7 4 mm) and submerged snippets of epithelium along with underlying tissues individually in 24-well plates with 0.3 ml bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM, Lonza) and incubated them at 37 \u00b0C (5% CO 2 ).

At collection time, we exposed the combined medium and tissue from each well to one freeze-thaw cycle, clarified them by low-speed centrifugation (3,000g, 5 min), then passaged with fresh tissue snippets or aliquoted and stored (\u221280 \u00b0C).Virus detection and quantification. We evaluated virus concentration by SYBR Green qRT-PCR reagents (Applied Biosystems) with primers (forward, 5\u2032-CCTCCGGCCCCTGAAT-3\u2032; reverse, 5\u2032-AAACACGGACACCCAAAGTA GT-3\u2032) that were complementary to the 5\u2032 UTR of HRV-A1, HRV-A16, HRV-B14 and HRV-C15. We used primers and probe for ACTB (4326315E, Applied Biosystems) to normalize RNA content in cell and tissue lysates. We isolated total RNA from 100 \u00b5l of growth medium or mucosal tissue (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen), reverse-transcribed it (TaqMan, Applied Biosystems) and performed PCR in duplicate (ABI 7000 Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems).

We cloned a cDNA fragment (867 bases) of HRV-C15, encoding the 5\u2032 UTR (partial), VP4 and partial VP2 genes into plasmid pMJ3 (ref. 29) after a T7 RNA polymerase promoter in reverse orientation to create plasmid pW10-2R. T7-induced transcription of linearized pW10-2R produced digoxigenin-labeled (Roche) probes that detect the viral genome RNA.

We incubated cells or tissues with the virus (1 h, 25 \u00b0C), washed three times and analyzed by qPCR. To test the efficacy of the capsid-binding compound WIN56291 (Sterling Winthrop), we incubated (30 min, 25 \u00b0C) virus samples (2 \u00d7 10 8 vRNA copies) in 0.1 ml BEGM containing the compound (0.5 \u00b5g ml \u22121 , 0.1% DMSO), followed by inoculation (5 h, 34 \u00b0C) into sinus organ cultures.

After reverse transcription with random primers (TaqMan, Applied Biosystems), we performed PCR with the Platinum PCR SuperMix HF (Invitrogen) and primers (Supplementary Table 3 ). The strategy for cloning the full-length cDNA copy of HRV-C15 is described in Supplementary Figure 2 . We confirmed each viral cDNA insert by automated sequencing of both strands.",
