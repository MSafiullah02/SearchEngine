Every ECMO device, whatever the brand, has a power and a battery light on the controller; make sure the battery light is off and the power light is on. On some device, there is an additional on/off switch next to the plug itself. Finally, make sure the power supply alarm is switched on which alerts you in case of an accidental unplugging or an electrical dysfunction. \u2022 Fluid connections: Fluids (air and oxygen) are connected to a blender which ensures gas exchanges.

The presence of tie-bands in the appropriate places and the safety of all connectors should be checked. The entire circuit (tubing and oxygenator) must be inspected with a flashlight, looking for clots and/or fibrin , and more specifically the connectors, pigtails, or stopcocks that may be on the circuit. Every center has its own tubing configuration, from a simple loop getting in and out the patient through the pump and the oxygenator, to more complex circuits with bridges, multiple pigtails, stopcocks to allow monitoring pressures, use as IV access to infuse volume or medication. The more connections that are present on the circuit, the more stagnation of blood is created. It enhances the risk of clot formation. That is why complex circuits must be watched with much more caution. -The ECMO (VV or VA) allows blood oxygenation. Hence, there is a color difference between cannulas: the admission cannula is dark red, deoxygenated blood, and the reinfusion cannula (starting after the oxygenator) is light red, oxygenated blood. The nurse should check this color difference between the cannulas (Fig. 5.1 ).",

The parameters are the rotations per minute (RPM) and the blood flow. The therapeutical goal set by the team is the blood flow. For the nurse, writing down these two parameters has no relevance. The correlation of the RPM and blood flow and its evolution through time will allow an effective management of the ECMO run. For example, at 2 pm, the RPM is set up at 4500 L/min for a blood flow at 4 L/min. At 5 pm, for a similar RPM, the blood flow went down to 2.5 L/min.

The choice of the mode depends on the human resources; if a nurse, ECMO specialist, or a perfusionist is constantly present at the patient's bedside, the intervention mode is possible, but if a nurse is taking care of more than one ECMO patients and cannot intervene immediately when the pump stops, the free mode will be safer.",

Bleeds can be related to the disease itself, especially for patients on VV ECMO with severe ARDS, but it can also be caused by a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) for patients on VA ECMO. It is recommended for patients on VV ECMO to use a humidifier on the ventilation tubing. Warming and humidifying the bronchial tree could minimize clot formation. \u2022 The aspect of the urine: Although rare, presence of blood in urine can occur. The urine color is then bright red. Be careful not to cofound it with the \"dark reddish\" color of the urine in case of hemolysis. \u2022 The digestive tract: Presence of blood in stools can be seen. If there is a doubt, use hydrogen peroxide on a stool sample. If foam appears, it means there is blood. In the absence of external bleeds or in severe DIC cases, a gastric lavage should be performed to check the presence or absence of blood. \u2022 General treatment: It is essential that the team understands and finds the right balance between pro-and anticoagulants to manage the patient properly. The daily blood count can assess the blood loss and the need to transfuse the patients with packed red blood cells or platelets. It is still a debate in the ECMO community to determine the cutoff for red blood cells transfusion; some teams (La Piti\u00e9 Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re is part of them) recommend to transfuse only when the hemoglobin is under 7 g/ dL; others argue that an ECMO patient should have a normal hemoglobin to allow an optimized oxygenation, so that the transfusion limit will be 12 g/dL. For long, ECMO teams have been reluctant to discontinue heparin during ECMO runs. Experiences from several teams and data show that in case of severe hemorrhage and if the patient is nonresponsive to transfusion and a decrease rate of the heparin infusion, the discontinuation of the heparin is possible [5] for hours and even days, with a strict control of the aPPT and a thorough check of the oxygenator and cannulas looking for clots and thrombin. In a worst case scenario, using recombinant factor VIIa has been done safely by several teams with a major decrease of bleedings, but must be a last resort therapy with an extreme caution and surveillance of the ECMO circuit [6] [7] [8] ",

When the heart recovers a pulsatility and the aortic valve begins to open, fully saturated blood from the ECMO mixes with the blood ejected from the native ventricle in the aorta and create a mixing cloud.

This is one case where this rule does not apply; the priority in case of decannulation is to avoid more blood loss and air embolism. Use the clamps available on the ECMO cart. If unfortunately there is only one clamp available, clamp the reinfusion line to avoid air embolism. And if there are no clamps, clamp the line manually.2. Call for help:It is impossible to manage this situation alone. The quicker you call for help, the safer it is for the patient. All ICU members must know where to find the emergency material or the number to call for the perfusion team to come. 3. Compress: The patient can bleed out from insertion point; so, once the lines are clamped, compress firmly.",
