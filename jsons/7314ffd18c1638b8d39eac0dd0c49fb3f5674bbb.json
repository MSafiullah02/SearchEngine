There is also 2 concern as to whether asthma treatments themselves could worsen the risk of disease or severity. 3 4 Current evidence shows that asthma is not in the top 10 comorbidities associated with COVID-5 19 fatalities, with obesity, diabetes and chronic heart disease more commonly reported. 1 This is 6 consistent with trends during the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, caused by a virus with close 7 sequence homology to SARS-CoV2, during which diabetes and heart disease were the leading 8 comorbidities, and not asthma. 2 However, comorbidities found with COVID-19 fatalities may 9 reflect confounding by age, and the CDC has reported that among younger patients hospitalized 10 for COVID-19, the most common comorbidities were obesity, asthma and diabetes. 3 While the 11 role of asthma in increasing the severity of COVID-19 infections remains unclear, anxiety 12 continues to be high among patients and their caregivers. 13 14 These concerns are not baseless. Asthma may increase the risk of developing viral respiratory 15 illnesses and even human rhinovirus (HRV), the most common cause of the common cold, is a 16 potent trigger of asthma exacerbations. 4 Synergism between allergen sensitization and viral 17 infections in patients with allergic asthma, weaker anti-viral defenses, and lower interferon (IFN) 18 production, all appear to contribute to the higher risk for viral infections in patients with asthma. 4 ",

While the usual 22 coronavirus infections are more likely confined to the upper airway, the predilection for COVID-23 19 to infect the lower airway, even in healthy individuals, creates even greater concern in 24 patients with asthma. 25 26 Additional questions of concern relate to the effects that asthma medications may have on 27 COVID-19 infections. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment of persistent 28 asthma and oral corticosteroids (OCS) are frequently used during acute exacerbations. 5 Multiple 29 in vitro studies have shown that corticosteroids inhibit viral-induced cytokines, but do not inhibit 30 interferons, which are an important antiviral defense mechanism. 5 Despite these inhibitory 31 effects and the overall efficacy of corticosteroids, however, patients with well controlled asthma 32 on ICS can still have virally-induced exacerbations. 33",

As many as 80% of asthma exacerbations are related to viral 55 infections. 4, 5 Thus, these effects on overall exacerbations suggest that these biologics may impact 56 virally-exacerbated disease. This effect has been best established for omalizumab, which 57 prevents IgE from binding to its receptor on plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Cross-linking of IgE 58 leads to lower type 1 interferon production, and in clinical studies, omalizumab has been shown 59 to decrease the risk of, duration, and viral shedding of HRV in allergic children. 9 60 61 Mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab also potentially play a role in enhancing immune 62 responses to viral infections given that a higher ratio of IFN-\u03b3 to-IL-5 mRNA is associated with 63 lower viral shedding and faster disease clearance. 10 In addition, recognizing that IL5 plays an 64 essential role in airway eosinophilic inflammation, its inhibition may make the airway less 65 susceptible to further lung injury from viruses such as COVID-19. 10 Dupilumab decreases 66 airway inflammation, allergic airway response, and asthma exacerbations. IL-4 is vital for 67 antibody switching to IgE, and IL-13 is a Th2 cytokine involved in airway hyperresponsiveness 68 and in airway remodeling, all of which are involved in susceptibility to and clearance of lower 69 airway viral infections. 4 Thus, it is likely that these biologics will lessen the risk of severe asthma 70 exacerbations with COVID-19, at least by reducing baseline airway inflammation and possibly 71 through specific antiviral properties. 72 SARS-CoV2 is an enveloped virus of the extremely diverse family of coronaviruses. Mapping of 74 the mechanism of COVID-19 clearance by the immune system of a patient who recovered from 75 COVID-19 showed that IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV2, follicular helper T cells and 76 antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were all detected in the patient's blood prior to recovery. 11 With 77 our knowledge of how the currently approved biologics work, we do not believe these 78 medications would interfere adversely with any of these pathways or worsen an individual's 79 immune response to COVID-19. It is actually plausible that these biologics, by limiting Th2 80 skewing, may make the immune system better poised to clear SARS-CoV2. While the immune 81 mechanisms for COVID-19 are yet to be fully defined, it is less likely that these biologics will 82",
