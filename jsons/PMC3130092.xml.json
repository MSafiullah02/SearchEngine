It is estimated that about 2 billion people, which is about a third of the world population, live in areas endemic for HEV and are at risk for infection. In these areas, hepatitis E is the major form of acute hepatitis; in India for example about 50% of acute hepatitis is due to HEV. It results in morbidity and increased mortality during pregnancy; these clinical aspects of hepatitis E are covered in detail in another review in this issue (R. Aggarwal).",

The history of hepatitis E and HEV is also covered in greater detail in another review in this issue (M.S. Khuroo). The discovery of viruses similar to HEV in pigs (swine HEV), chickens (avian HEV) and more recently in rabbits and rodents, as well as the successful transmission of swine HEV to macaques, which are a model for human HEV transmission, led to the idea of HEV as a zoonosis. This belief is further strengthened by studies from Japan that have used nucleotide sequence identity to link viruses recovered from uncooked meat (pigs and deer) and humans who became infected after consuming the meat. The discovery and analysis of animal HEVs (X.J. Meng) and the unique transmission situations in Japan (T. Miyamura) are also covered separately in this issue.",

More recently, pigs have also been used for transmission and molecular studies (Meng et al., 1998). However, a small animal model for HEV is still elusive. That and the lack of a suitable in vitro cell culture system have hampered virological studies on HEV. However, cell culture systems based on replicon RNA transfection and more recently those using the virus, have become available. These are covered in greater detail in another review in this issue (Okamoto).",

The viral genome also has short 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs) and a conserved 58-nucleotide region within orf1; these elements are likely to fold into conserved stem-loop and hairpin structures. These structures and a sequence closer to the 3\u2032 end of orf1, which has homology to the alphavirus junction region, are proposed to be important for HEV RNA replication (Purdy et al., 1993). The region between the end of orf1 and start of orf3/orf2 appears to be complex and contains regulatory elements. These details are shown in Fig. 1\n.",

In this model, the orf1 stop codon at position 5105 (nucleotide position according to the genotype 1 SAR-55 strain) overlaps with the orf3 start codon at position 5104. Two in-frame AUG codons at positions 5113 and 5131 were considered to code for methionine residues in the ORF3 protein. These are followed by another AUG codon in the \u22121 frame, which was proposed to be the orf2 start codon.

In stable Huh-7 cell lines made from functional HEV RNA replicons expressing the neomycin resistance gene from orf2 and orf3, the genomic RNA and only one subgenomic RNA were observed. The capped 2.2 kb subgenomic RNA initiated at nucleotide position 5122, which was downstream of the first two methionine codons in orf3, and was bicistronic, for the translation of ORF3 and ORF2 (Fig. 1). This model also rationalizes the reading frame differences observed in genotype 4 HEV isolates, which contain a T base insertion between nucleotides 5116/5117 (in SAR-55), thus taking AUG3 in a different translation frame. Translation of the ORF3 protein from AUG3 starting at nucleotide 5131 (in the SAR-55 strain) would be the same in all four genotypes of HEV. This model was confirmed by intrahepatic inoculation of wild type and mutant genotype 3 swine HEV replicons into pigs (Huang et al., 2007). Mutation of AUG1 or the insertion of a T base as in genotype 4 did not affect virus infectivity or rescue, but the mutation of AUG3 abolished virus infectivity.",

RNA polymerase-directed RNA synthesis initiates with a 5\u2032ppp nucleotide and thus all RNA molecules initially carry an exposed 5\u2032ppp moiety, which is removed by processing. Thus, capping of the viral RNA, besides aiding its translation through recognition by the ribosome, would also be important in protecting the virus from innate host responses.",

Though the alignment score was low, the prediction was strengthened by conservation of the \u2018X\u2019 domain in HEV, which in other systems was found exclusively in association with the PCP. This alignment placed the putative PCP domain in the region of amino acids 433\u2013592 of the ORF1 polyprotein. However, no functional activity for the HEV protease has so far been described. As mentioned above, extended incubations of the ORF1 polyprotein expressed using a recombinant vaccinia virus yielded products of 107 kDa and 78 kDa (Ropp et al., 2000). But, mutagenesis of Cys483 predicted by sequence alignments to be part of the catalytic dyad, had no effect on the generation of these products. Further, the other member of the proposed catalytic dyad, His590 is missing from the putative HEV protease. The presence of a functional protease within ORF1 and its role in polyprotein processing thus remains an unanswered question.",

Helicases are divided into six superfamilies (SF-1 to SF-6) and further into subfamilies depending upon whether they unwind in the 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 (A) or 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032 (B) direction. The SF-1 and SF-2 families of helicases are the most common and each has seven signature motifs that are involved in the binding and hydrolysis of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs), and binding of the nucleic acids (DNA/RNA). The putative RNA helicase of HEV was shown to contain all the seven conserved motifs found in SF-1 helicases and proposed to have the NTPase as well as RNA-binding domains (Koonin et al., 1992). Experimental evidence for this was provided recently. Karpe and Lole (2010b) expressed the region corresponding to ORF1 amino acids 960\u20131204 in E. coli, and the purified recombinant protein showed both NTPase and RNA unwinding activities. The enzyme hydrolyzed all rNTPs but also dNTPs with a lower efficiency, and showed unwinding activity only on RNA duplexes with 5\u2032 overhangs. Mutants in the nucleotide-binding motif I (GKS \u2192 GAS) or the Mg2+-binding motif II (DEAP \u2192 AAAP) showed reduced ATPase activity and had no RNA unwinding activity, indicating generation of energy as a critical requirement for helicase activity. The HEV helicase belongs to the 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032 class of SF-1 family of helicases that are also found in other positive-strand RNA viruses such as alphaviruses, arteriviruses, coronaviruses and rubiviruses.",

Two stem-loop structures in the 3\u2032 end of the HEV RNA as well as the poly(A) stretch were found to be required for this binding. Further, the recombinant RdRp was also able to use the 3\u2032 end of the HEV RNA as a template to synthesize the complementary strand in vitro. Since anti-RdRp antibodies were earlier shown to immunoprecipitate an \u223c37 kDa protein from cells transfected with an infectious replicon, a later study stably expressed an \u223c40 kDa C-terminal region of the ORF1 polyprotein as a fusion with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Rehman et al., 2008). This 68-kDa replicase-EGFP fusion protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and was a functional replicase due to its ability to copy HEV plus-strand RNA transfected into these cells.

These are domains with homology to the non-histone domain of the histone macroH2A (Pehrson and Fried, 1992). Their association with proteins involved in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerization, ADP-ribosylation and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, suggest that macro domains contribute to ADP-ribose metabolism and post-translational modifications (Aguiar et al., 2005). A few viral families, which include all members of Coronaviridae, rubella virus and alphaviruses (Togaviridae) and HEV, also encode macro domains (Snijder et al., 2003). All these viruses replicate their RNA in the cytoplasm of animal cells in membrane-associated replication complexes (Salonen et al., 2005). In these viruses, macro domains are closely associated with the typical replicase complexes that include RNA helicase and RdRp, and unlike some of their eukaryotic homologs, viral macro domain proteins do not enter the nucleus.",

These are present only in a small subset of RNA viruses that replicate in the cytosol, and form an essential part of the viral genome. Egloff et al.

Based on their in vitro binding and competition experiments, Neuvonen and Ahola (2009) suggest that the viral macro domains could have a role in viral RNA replication and/or transcription. Since the HEV and SFV macro domains can also bind poly(ADP-ribose) in the presence of poly(A), they could recruit poly(ADP-ribose)-modified cellular factors to the replication complex while bound to viral polyadenylated RNA. These possibilities await experimental confirmation.",

When expressed in animal cells in culture, ORF2 proteins of \u223c74 kDa and \u223c88 kDa were observed, which were proven with tunicamycin and endoglysidase treatment studies to be the nonglycosylated and glycosylated forms, respectively (Jameel et al., 1996). Pulse-chase studies and the use of microsomal membranes showed the ORF2 protein to contain a N-terminal signal sequence that translocates the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum, where it acquires N-linked glycosylation (Jameel et al., 1996). The glycosylation sites on the ORF2 protein were mapped to conserved asparagine (Asn) residues 137, 310 and 562 (Zafrullah et al., 1999) (Fig. 1). Though the earlier studies were based on ectopic expression of the orf2 gene in cultured cells, replicon-based expression of the ORF2 protein has subsequently confirmed its N-linked glycosylation (Graff et al., 2008). Further, mutations in the glycosylation sites on the ORF2 protein prevented the formation of infectious virus particles from transfected replicons, and these particles had low infectivity in macaques (Graff et al., 2008). Recently, Yamada et al. (2009) constructed an infectious clone of HEV that propagates efficiently in cultured PLC/PRF/5 cells. Using this model they show the intracellular expression and secretion of an 83 kDa ORF2 protein. Though these authors did not directly test glycosylation of the ORF2 protein, a size significantly larger than the predicted size of \u223c72 kDa, suggests this possibility. These observations are not in agreement with an earlier suggestion that the glycosylated form of the ORF2 protein is unstable and only the non-glycosylated protein forms the viral capsid (Torresi et al., 1999). Various observations suggest a role for cellular membranes in HEV replication and particle maturation. In such a scenario, glycosylation of the ORF2 capsid protein would be of advantage.",

The full-length ORF2 protein when similarly expressed was processed into 63 kDa, 56 kDa and 53 kDa proteins, which correspond to truncated proteins spanning amino acid residues 112\u2013660, 112\u2013607 and 112\u2013578, respectively (Robinson et al., 1998). Cryoelectron microscopy and image reconstruction methods showed the VLPs to have a T\n = 1 structure with protruding dimers at the icosahedral twofold symmetry axes such that the 60 monomers were organized as 30 morphological units (Xing et al., 1999). Subsequently, amino acids 126\u2013601 in the ORF2 protein were found to be essential for the formation of secreted VLPs in this expression system (Li et al., 2005). The X-ray crystal structures obtained recently show the ORF2 protein monomers to contain three distinct domains \u2013 the shell (S), middle (M) and protruding (P) domains (Yamashita et al., 2009, Guu et al., 2009). Recently, Xing et al. (2010) have produced a large virion-sized and a small T\n = 1 particle by expressing the ORF2 protein in insect cells with or without the N-terminal 111 amino acids, respectively. The virion-sized particle showed a T\n = 3 icosahedral lattice and contained a \u223c2 kb RNA derived from the orf2 gene; the T\n = 1 particle showed no encapsidated RNA. Though these data suggest that RNA encapsidation drives virion assembly, the presence of subgenomic RNA in the T\n = 3 particle is surprising, since RNA viruses package only the genomic RNA species. Further, a potential packaging signal was identified using a yeast three-hybrid approach towards the 5\u2032 end of the genome, within the orf1 gene (Surjit et al., 2004). More structural details on the ORF2 capsid can be found in another article in this issue (Mori and Matsuura).",

Meng et al.

The minimal neutralizing domain has now been mapped to residues 458\u2013607 (Zhou et al., 2004).

The purified p239 protein, which structurally and antigenically resembles the HEV capsomere, bound and penetrated different cell lines susceptible in vitro to HEV infection (He et al., 2008). In pull-down experiments, p239 showed binding to Grp78/BiP, alpha-tubulin and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and inhibitor studies showed HSP90 to be important for the intracellular trafficking of p239 (Zheng et al., 2010). The ORF2 VLPs produced in insect cells were also shown to bind Huh7 liver cells and this binding was dependent upon heparan surface proteoglycans (HSPGs) present on cell surface Syndecans (Kalia et al., 2009). Analogous to binding studies with p239 (He et al., 2008), our studies show that the VLPs also bind to cell lines susceptible to HEV infection; these are further taken up into Huh7 cells through fluid endosomes (M. Kalia, R. Holla, S. Jameel; unpublished results). More studies along these lines are likely to identify the cellular receptor for HEV and characterize the virus uptake and uncoating pathway in infected cells.",

Very little is known about the interactions of the ORF2 protein with cellular components and pathways, besides that with HSP90 (He et al., 2008) and HSPGs (Kalia et al., 2009) summarized above. The ORF2 protein expressed in animal cells was observed to localize to the ER, where it causes ER stress and some of the protein is retrotranslocated into the cytoplasm through a canonical ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Surjit et al., 2007). Whether these effects of the ORF2 protein have a bearing on HEV assembly and egress or on virus entry and intracellular trafficking remains to be seen.",

Using a replicon system based on genomic RNA produced in vitro, orf3 was found to be dispensable for replication in vitro in Huh7 and other cell lines (Emerson et al., 2006). However, it was required for infection in monkeys that received intrahepatic inoculation of HEV genomic RNA (Graff et al., 2005).

This Erk activation was independent of the traditional Raf/MEK pathway, but depended upon the ability of the ORF3 protein to bind and inactivate Pyst1, a prototypic member of the Erk-specific MAPK phosphatase (Kar-Roy et al., 2004). By binding to the central linker region of Pyst1 through its N-terminal D1 domain, the ORF3 protein was proposed to block conformational changes in the phosphatase, which are required for its Erk-mediated activation (Kar-Roy et al., 2004). Prolonged Erk activation was proposed to generate a survival and proliferative signal. Cells expressing the ORF3 protein also displayed higher levels of hexokinase and oligomeric forms of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which lead to attenuation of mitochondrial death signaling (Moin et al., 2007). Subcellular localization of the ORF3 protein to early and recycling endosomes delayed post-internalization trafficking of the activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Chandra et al., 2008a). This was recently found to be true for the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) as well, and depended upon the ability of the ORF3 protein to interact with CIN85, a multidomain adaptor protein implicated in the downregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (Chandra et al., 2010). In the suggested model, the ORF3 protein binds to CIN85, possibly through the proline-rich P2 domain in the former and SH3 domains in the latter. This competes with formation of the growth factor receptor\u2013Cbl\u2013CIN85 complex, resulting in reduced trafficking of activated growth factors towards the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment where the receptor is degraded (Chandra et al., 2010). Such a scenario would prolong endomembrane growth factor signaling and again promote cell survival and proliferation.",

Increased secretion of alpha-1-microglobulin was also observed from ORF3-expressing cells (Surjit et al., 2006). This was mediated by the tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101) protein, a member of the endosomal-sorting complex, which bound the ORF3 protein through a conserved PSAP motif in its P2 domain. Since alpha-1-microglobulin is an immunosuppressive protein, this was also proposed to protect virus-infected cells in the liver (Surjit et al., 2006). In support of these in vitro results, alpha-1-microglobulin levels were significantly higher in the urine of hepatitis E patients compared to acute hepatitis B patients and healthy controls (Taneja et al., 2009, Taneja et al., 2011).",

Its interaction with the ORF3 protein led to reduced fibrinogen beta secretion from cells; the transcription of alpha, beta and gamma fibrinogen genes, was also reduced in ORF3-expressing cells (Ratra et al., 2009). This is likely to be due to the effects of the ORF3 protein on intracellular trafficking since fibrinogen is also an acute phase protein whose expression is induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) through the STAT3 transcription factor. Hemopexin is a heme-binding 60 kDa acute phase plasma glycoprotein, which protects cells from hemoglobin-mediated oxidative damage during intravascular hemolysis. It also plays an important role in iron metabolism, and together with transferrin and haptoglobin is responsible for iron homeostasis. The ORF3 protein binds hemopexin through its D2 domain, and this is proposed to aid in viral infection by affecting cellular iron homeostasis (Ratra et al., 2008).

It promotes cell survival and proliferation through Erk activation, extended endomembrane signaling from activated growth factor receptors, and attenuation of mitochondrial death signals. The ORF3 protein also dampens innate host responses through an attenuated acute phase response and increased secretion of immunosuppressive factors such as alpha-1-microglobulin. A third possible role of regulating cellular energy homeostasis can be added to these. It must again be emphasized that almost all of these results are based on over-expression of the ORF3 protein in cell lines. They await confirmation in virus infection systems.",

Using an immunocapture PCR assay, the ORF3 protein was found on the surface of cell culture generated HEV, which also showed a lower density than the ORF3-deficient virus. These observations indicate that the ORF3 protein is important for HEV egress and that it is present on the virion surface, possibly in association with lipids (Yamada et al., 2009). An earlier study had shown that anti-ORF3 antibodies could capture HEV particles from the serum, but not the feces of hepatitis E patients (Takahashi et al., 2008). In this study as well, the serum HEV banded at a lower density compared to fecal HEV, suggesting that the former is associated with lipids, and that this coat is possibly shed during its passage through the enteric system.",

(2010) study implicated the role of any host protein in ORF3-mediated HEV release, the requirement of the PSAP motif suggests a possible role for Tsg101, which was earlier shown to bind the ORF3 protein (Surjit et al., 2006). Several RNA viruses bear proline-rich sequences in their \u2018late domains\u2019, which are required for viral budding. These include P(S/T)AP and PPXY (X, any amino acid) motifs, which hijack host proteins in the vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) pathway. This pathway gives rise to multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which is topologically identical to virus budding (Chen and Lamb, 2008). Viral \u2018late domains\u2019 interact with members of the VPS pathway, and redirect the complexes to the site of virus budding on the plasma membrane (Chen and Lamb, 2008). Though HEV is a non-enveloped virus, its association with lipids, subcellular localization of the ORF3 protein to endosomes (Chandra et al., 2008a) and a requirement for its PSAP motif in viral egress suggests that HEV follows the VPS pathway for its release from infected cells (Fig. 5\n).",

Again, the utility of this approach among the vast majority of HEV infections that are acute remains questionable.",

Much of the early information and models of the HEV life cycle and genome replication were based on comparative information from other better-characterized positive-strand RNA viruses. Viral ORFs have been expressed in various heterologous systems and the proteins characterized biochemically. With the recent availability of replicon- and infection-based in vitro cell culture models, the molecular virology of HEV is becoming increasingly clear. While there are a few surprises, such as the association of lipids with a non-enveloped virus, many earlier observations have also been confirmed in recent experiments.",

There are short stretches of untranslated regions at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends that fold into stem-loop structures (shown in blue). The three open reading frames are shown. ORF1 encodes a nonstructural polyprotein and contains a 58-nucleotide stretch near its 5\u2032 end that folds into a stem-loop structure (shown in green). The ORF2 and ORF3 proteins are translated from a 2.2 kb subgenomic RNA generated during viral replication. The boxed region on the upper right shows the sequence alignment of the junction region between orf1 and orf3 in HEV isolates representative of genotypes 1\u20134. The nucleotide positions are shown with respect to HEV genotype 1 (Sar55). Dots indicate identity and dashes represent deletions. The orf1 stop codon is shown in red. There is a single nucleotide insertion (T, indicated with filled triangle) between positions 5116 and 5117 in HEV genotype 4. The four initiation codons within this junction region are shown in yellow boxes, and are at positions 5104, 5113, 5131 and 5145. This region has been predicted to fold into a double stem-loop structure shown in the boxed region on the left.

A truncated protein of 56 kDa (amino acids 112\u2013607) can self-assemble in insect cells to form virus-like particles (VLPs), which possess the same dominant antigenic epitopes as the virion. Various shorter constructs have been expressed in E. coli. Of these, p239 forms particles via dimeric interactions while E2 and E2a form hexameric surface protrusions. The E2s is proposed as the dimerization domain. Two of these proteins (yellow highlight) have undergone clinical testing in humans as HEV vaccine candidates.

The viral particles are concentrated on the surface of target cells through heparin sulfate proteoglycans acting as attachment factors (red wavy lines) (step 1) and subsequently bind a specific yet uncharacterized receptor (step 2), following which the particles are internalized (step 3). The virus then uncoats (step 4) to release genomic RNA (red noodles) that is translated in the cytoplasm into nonstructural proteins (step 5). These nonstructural proteins include the RNA dependent RNA polymerase that replicates the positive sense genomic RNA into negative sense transcripts (purple noodles) (step 6); the latter then act as templates for the synthesis of a 2.2 kb subgenomic RNA (step 7a) as well as full-length positive sense transcripts (step 7b). The positive sense subgenomic RNA is translated into ORF2 (blue) and ORF3 (crimson) proteins (step 8). The ORF2 protein packages the genomic RNA to assemble new virions (step 9) while the ORF3 protein may optimize the host cell environment for viral replication. The ORF3 protein is also associated with endomembranes (step 10a) or plasma membranes (step 10b) and may aid in viral egress. Recent studies suggest that mature virions are associated with the ORF3 protein and lipids (step 11), which are subsequently removed through a process that is not understood at present, to resume a fresh infection cycle.
