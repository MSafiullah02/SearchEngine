Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis. We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions. Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit. At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19. All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities.

All assays were validated by the French National Reference Center (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) [15] CT scan protocol and image interpretation. Whenever available, CT images were centrally reviewed by two senior radiologists with consensus qualitative and semiquantitative assessment.

The predominant pattern was determined for each examination. The severity (%) of lung involvement was evaluated according to the French Society of Radiology guidelines [18] . The presence of lung or pleural metastases was assessed by comparison with previous CT scans.

Prophylactic changes implemented in breast cancer care (e.g., postponement of all non-mandatory visits to ICH, changes in medical treatments, etc.) may also have contributed to further reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of our study is that some patients may have been treated by their family physicians or referred to local hospitals, without any notification to ICH. Rates of high BMI and hypertension in our COVID-19 patient cohort were very similar to those reported in a recent prospective large-scale report on French breast cancer patients [21] , suggesting that these comorbidities do not increase the risk of COVID-19. Our analyses showed that breast cancer patients have similar clinical and radiologic features of COVID-19 to those previously described in other reports on non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we found no trend in favor of a relationship between a history of breast and lymph node radiation therapy, radiation therapy sequela and radiologic extent of disease or outcome.",

As of April 26 th , the reported mortality rate among RNA-positive patients in the general population ranges from 18.2% in France to 5.6% in the USA and 3.7% in Germany [4]. However, these percentages reflect more testing policy more than true differences in mortality rates. As in the general population, the true infection and mortality rates could subsequently be determined by serology tests detecting an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, on univariate analysis, age and hypertension were associated with disease severity rather than the extent of disease or ongoing cancer therapy, suggesting that breast cancer patients share the same risk factors for severe COVID-19 as the general population. Strikingly, the only early breast cancer patient who died was concomitantly treated for a systemic disease by a CTLA-4 signalling modulator, suggesting that breast cancer per se is not a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality.",

She was diagnosed with stage IIB triple-negative breast cancer in February 2020 and started neoadjuvant chemotherapy (epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) in March. Three days after the first cycle, she \u2039as referred to the emergency room (ER) with chest pain, fever and lung infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed based on positive RNA PCR and chest CT scan. She was admitted to ICU for acute respiratory distress on day 3, treated with antibiotics and endotracheal intubation and ventilation. She died 16 days later.Patient #2 was a 44-year-old patient with no relevant medical history, diagnosed with de novo stage IV hormone-sensitive breast cancer (node, bone and hepatic metastases, with 4N cytolysis) in February 2020. She received a first-line combination of CDK4/6 inhibitor, aromatase inhibitor and complete ovarian function suppression. On day 17 of her first month of treatment, she was referred to the ER for asthenia, dyspnea, thrombocytopenia (14,000/mm 3 ) and neutropenia (200/mm 3 ). She was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 lung infection complicated by thrombotic microangiopathy, based on positive RNA test, chest CT scan and laboratory data. She was treated symptomatically, including antibiotics, and was not transferred to the intensive care unit due to her metastatic disease. She died 8 days after ER admission.Patient #3 was a 78-year-old woman with a history of hypertension. She had been treated since November 2013 for stage IV hormone-sensitive breast cancer (lung and bone metastases). In March 2020, she received two cycles of weekly paclitaxel as second-line chemotherapy. Five days after the last injection, she was referred to the ER with dyspnea and hypoxia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed based on a typical chest CT scan with extensive consolidation involving approximately 50% of the lungs. PCR RNA test was negative. Hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics were rapidly initiated on day 1, but the patient was not transferred to the intensive care unit due to her metastatic disease. She died on day 4.",
