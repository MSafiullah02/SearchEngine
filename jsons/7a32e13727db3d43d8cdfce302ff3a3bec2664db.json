To mark the 50th volume of this Journal, I chronicle and highlight scientific milestones, and those within the discipline, as documented in the pages of Clinical Chemistry. Amazing progress has been made in the field of laboratory diagnostics over these five decades, in many cases paralleling-as well as being bolstered by-the rapid pace in the development of computer technologies. Specific areas of laboratory medicine particularly well represented in Clinical Chemistry include lipids, endocrinology, protein markers, quality of laboratory measurements, molecular diagnostics, and general advances in methodology and instrumentation.",

            "text": "In reviewing nearly 100 000 pages of the journal, I was again struck by how much has changed, yet how much has remained the same (1 ) . Over the years, many papers were devoted to general topics still very much of interest to our readers today: lipids, endocrinology, protein markers, quality of results, and advances in methodology. Of course, much has also gone the way of high-button shoes and 5\u00a2 coffee, such as thymol flocculation tests and measurement of protein-bound iodine. The development of the field of laboratory diagnostics can be seen in tracing the evolution of figures within papers, from the large number of photographs and hand-drawn diagrams of glassware that were characteristic of the first years of publication to displays of results from devices, rather than the devices themselves. I was occasionally amused by the now-quaint spellings of \"technic\" and \"computor\", as well as the liberal use of the plural \"serums\". The AACC annual meeting played a central role over the years, with names of speakers, awardees, and their abstracts and biographies printed as regular or supplemental pages. Review of those entries will help to further document the interesting topics of the day, as well as to uncover such-today politically incorrect-entries as \"ladies programs\". Those days, however, also boasted hotel rooms with daily rates of $7.50 in Santa Monica and $8.50 in Boston; \"charming\" pictures of meeting venues also graced our pages.",

            "text": "Many of today's efforts at standardization and harmonization were more than foreshadowed in several seminal papers appearing in this Journal during the 1960s and 1970s; perhaps if more attention had been paid to these papers when they were published three or four decades ago, current standardization efforts might not be so necessary, or at least not so difficult and costly in their implementation. Another theme that often appeared was the role of the profession of medical laboratorians and relationships among professional societies; some of the rhetoric makes for more-thaninteresting reading that borders on voyeurism. The give and take in correspondence regarding various view points on the various issues of the day (13 ) also seemed to contain far more spleen than the tamer exchanges that are encountered today. Nonetheless, it betrays an enthusiasm that can be admired whichever side one might have supported. I was also struck by the specific \"personality\" of the journal under each of its three editors as it evolved and developed. Although they appeared on our mastheads under differing titles, their role clearly match that of \"Editor-in-Chief\" in other publishing circles. It may be happenstance that their tenures were contemporaneous with reasonably defined advances and achievements in the field: \"Managing Editor\" Appleton (1955) (1956) (1957) (1958) (1959) (1960) (1961) (1962) (1963) (1964) (1965) (1966) (1967) (1968) (1969) with the period establishing the discipline as we know it today and with the automation of classical chemistry procedures; \"Executive Editor\" King (1970 King ( -1990 coincided with advances in immunoassay, computer-assisted techniques, and new instrumentation; and our current adjectiveless \"Editor\" Bruns (1991-) has been coeval with applications of molecular biology and evidence-based medicine. The journal has benefited greatly from the occupancy of the Editor's chair by these three; a history of the Journal's leadership appears elsewhere (12 ) .",

Admittedly, these prescient comments are rather atypical for our pages; the Journal has generally been filled with factual and useful information that advances our knowledge and profession in an incremental fashion. I was both rather surprised and more than slightly disappointed that there was precious little in the way of extravagant or, even better, dystopic, predictions of \"clinical chemistry of the future\" to regale the readers of this overview.",

            "text": "As predicted by Seligson over 40 years ago (15 ) , computers have had a powerful role in clinical chemistry, as in most other disciplines. As we look back on 50 years of articles, the advances in laboratory medicine in many ways parallel the spectacular achievements in the semiconductor and computer fields: ever faster/better/cheaper. In the last decade, computers and the Internet have played a dominant role in the dissemination of scientific information. Our Journal was one of the first to embrace these technologies, and it went \"online\" in 1998 with full content available back to 1997. Abstracts of articles also were accessible for the period 1975-1996, and authors and titles of articles were listed for the period 1965-1974. This too will change. In the very near future, the full content of Clinical Chemistry, from Volume 1, page 1 up to the current issue will be made available online. With this occurrence of a totally electronic version, I take a fair degree of gratification in imagining that I may well be the last person to have browsed through all 50 years of Clinical Chemistry in its 200-kg paper incarnation (Fig. 1 ). Although librarians, and atavists of all ages, may bemoan the eventual demise of the medium of choice for the past few hundred years, I shall not be among them. This project has more than reinforced my leanings toward the obsolescence of a very inefficient vehicle for communicating data, ideas, and information. The hundreds of decaying, amber-colored pages that I reviewed also challenge the idea that electronic is ephemeral and that paper is permanent.",
