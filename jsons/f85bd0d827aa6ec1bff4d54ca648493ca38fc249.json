            "text": "A conversation I had aboard an airplane traveling from Houston to Denver inspired this book's title. After settling in my seat, I learned that the passenger beside me was an airline pilot. I asked him many questions during the flight, as air travel has always interested me. My newly made friend explained lift and drag, the workings of air traffic communications, and his preferred types of aircraft. I wanted to understand how he coped with the responsibility of so many lives. When he asked about my occupation -having just conversed about a profession recognized for its responsibility, social utility, and respect -I felt pressure to depict my work in a socially relevant context. I described my current project. The project hoped to assess public attitudes toward a ballot initiative to ban wildlife trapping in Colorado. Wildlife management, as a profession, saw the impending ballot initiative as a threat. Managers felt that issues like wildlife trapping should be left to wildlife professionals and not voted on by the general public. Trapping, an important tool for Colorado's ranching community and an integral part of the pioneering spirit of rural Colorado, was also scrutinized by the public, a portion of whom were adamant because they viewed trapping as animal cruelty. The pilot's response surprised me: ''Why do people get all upset about something like that? Who cares that much about wildlife anyway?'' I considered that important question, and that question made me think of Jim, a wildlife manager who worked for the Colorado Division of Wildlife.",

Visitors to U.S. national parks rank viewing wildlife as a top reason for their attendance, and this would undoubtedly be true for visitors to a number of the world's protected areas, which now extend across 12% of the earth's surface (Brooks et al., 2004) . Further evidence of wildlife as a driving force for tourism can be found in the 2006 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (2007) National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation. This study showed that 87 million Americans participated in some form of wildlife-associated recreation, including hunting (12.5 million people), fishing (24.5 million people), wildlife viewing involving trips away from home (22.9 million people) or viewing in one's day-to-day residential life (77 million people). Other data hint at a widespread global interest in wildlife-associated recreation. For example, the 1996 Survey on the Importance of Nature to Canadians indicates that approximately 18% of the Canadian population, or 4.2 million people, participated in fishing, and 5% of the population, or 1.2 million people, participated in hunting (Federal-Provincial Task Force on the Importance of Nature to Canadians, 1999) .",

While hunting and fishing in the United States has declined, wildlife viewing has increased (Aiken, 1999; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2007) . Simultaneously, many specialized forms of wildlife-associated recreation have grown considerably in the last two decades. Hoyt (2000) estimated that the number of whale-watching tourists worldwide increased from 4 million in 1991 to 9 million in 1998. Bucking the overall trend of hunting in the United States, participation in trophy hunting in Africa has increased since the early 1990s, including a fourfold increase in Namibia and twofold increase in South Africa (Lindsey, Roulet, & Romanach, 2007) . These few examples do not reveal the growth that is also occurring in the many specialty niche markets in wildlife-associated recreation including, for example, fly-fishing the flats in the tropics, bird viewing in Thailand or Costa Rica, viewing birds and reptiles on the Galapagos Islands, dolphin feeding in Australia, viewing monkeys at the temples in Singapore, and viewing butterflies in Mexico. The growth in these opportunities is related to strong consumer demand, the relatively low capital investment needed for ecotourism businesses, and the strong potential for local employment.",

There has also been a growing market for TV and cinema that focuses on the natural habits of wildlife instead of prior programming that featured wildlife primarily as anthropomorphized characterizations of human life. Animal Planet, a TV channel launched in 1996 that televises features about animals (wild and domesticated), has experienced rapid growth. As of 2005 it reached 237 million subscribers in 160 countries who speak 24 languages (Broadband TV News, 2005) . The interest and growth of this programming is global with the channel most recently expanding to Germany, Italy, and Vietnam (Discovery Communications Inc., 2004) . Additional examples of the rapid growth are the rising numbers of subscribers: In Latin America the increase was by 24% between 1999 and 2000 to 9 million subscribers, and, likewise, in Asia the increase was by 205% to more than 24 million subscribers (BBC, 2001) .

See Knight and Gutzwiller (1995) for an introduction to the multiple ways that recreation can negatively impact wildlife species (e.g., direct effects through encounters, altering prey species, altering habitat, and habituation).

A woodpecker drums on the vent pipes of my house, telling everyone that the territory I regard as mine is also his. The morning paper reports that a jogger was bitten by a rattlesnake at a local reservoir. Ignoring the trailhead sign that warned of snakes, the jogger did not know the snake was dangerous and continued her run after being bitten. Fortunately, she encountered mountain bikers who immediately took her for help. Just last month an 11-year-old boy was killed by a bear while camping in Utah. The bear was believed to have become habituated to campers, finding campgrounds a good location to obtain easy food. For me, like many people in the world, undesirable wildlife encounters are part of daily life and their impacts can be significant. Conover (2002) estimated that human-wildlife conflict causes $22.3 billion in losses per year in the United States alone. The largest expense ($8.3 billion) is incurred in urban areas and is due to mice, squirrels, raccoons, moles, pigeons, starlings, and skunks. Agricultural loss is estimated at $4.5 billion per year while annual loss due to deer-auto collisions is estimated at $1.6 billion.",

Expanding human settlement is believed to be the most critical reason: Driven by population pressures, economic growth, and the expanding global demand for natural resources, humans occupy more and more places. As this occurs, it destroys or fragments habitat, forcing humans and wildlife into confrontation. Because humans and wildlife share habitat, human-wildlife conflict is often coincidental; however, sometimes conflict occurs because humans want to be close to wildlife. For example, results show that 55.5 million Americans engage in wildlife feeding activities (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2007). Wildlife attracts tourists, and feeding wildlife has, in some cases, become a planned tourism activity (Orams, 2002) . Feeding wildlife can lead to habituation, and animals may identify humans as a food source instead of a threat. Habituation is believed to be a factor in the death of a 9-year-old boy at an Australian World Heritage site; the boy was attacked by dingoes habituated through tourist feeding behavior (Thompson, Shirreffs, & McPhail, 2003) . Beyond such direct attacks, human contact with wildlife can affect disease transmission. I review that concern in the next section.",

Macaques have a special status in Buddhist and Hindu cultures. They tend to congregate around temples where residents, workers, and tourists come in close contact with them. Through interaction with these macaques, people can be exposed through bites, scratches, or mucosal splashes. In these situations, there is a risk from transmission of pathogens such as herpes B, simian virus 40, simian foamy virus, and other simian retroviruses. The transmission of pathogens occurs both ways. Research shows macaques risk exposure to influenza and measles from humans (Jones-Engel, Engel, Schillaci, Babo, & Froehlich, 2001) .",

CWD is a prion-based disease that kills deer and elk, and it has a significant effect on these animal populations in the United States. Recreational hunters in the United States harvest and consume thousands of these animals annually; this increases concern about the possibility of transmission of the disease. Should transmission occur, it would significantly affect human health.

At that time, game scarcity, extirpation, and extinction were part of a growing number of concerns over the resiliency of wildlife populations. Dramatic forest fires followed extensive clear-cutting in the Midwest. Erosion threatened farm productivity, and timber extraction outstripped regenerative capabilities. Mining and industrial pollution diminished the ability of lakes and rivers to support aquatic life (Frederick & Sedjo, 1991) . With growing human populations and technological advances, such as the repeating rifle, many wildlife populations were rapidly depleted or became extinct (Harrington, 1991) . The conservation leaders of that time, including Gifford Pinchot and Aldo Leopold, were guided by a desire to ensure ''sustained yield'' of natural materials. The emerging tradition of wildlife management during this time was to convert hunting from exploitation to cropping (Peyton, 2000) , and the results were immensely successful. The North American wildlife management profession -including its effective regulation of harvest, restoration of game populations, philosophy of science-based management, politically powerful stakeholder lobby, and sustained funding base (i.e., hunter and angler license fees) -must be considered one of the most notable conservation success stories.",

Legislation, such as the Endangered Species Act of 1973, symbolized concern for losses, even among species that had no utilitarian purpose. Studies of that time period show that a significant number of Americans were opposed to recreational hunting (Kellert, 1978; Shaw, 1977) , and early research on public values shows a diversity of values toward wildlife, including a significant emphasis on non-utilitarian views regarding the resource (Kellert, 1980) . In this values transition, wildlife, once viewed as villainous creatures, came to symbolize the lost ecological integrity desired by the public. An illustration of this was revealed in a recent metaanalysis of studies since the 1970s. The study showed that people in the United States currently favor wolves and wolf reintroduction (Williams, Ericsson, & Heberlein, 2002) , whereas in the early twentieth century, the species was targeted for extirpation throughout the country.",

Newly emerging non-governmental organizations and new types of academic programs (e.g., Conservation Biology) champion the broader concerns for global biodiversity. The focus of this movement is on global issues, and its approach is ecosystemic and integrative across disciplines. Funding comes from grassroots memberships and private donations. As an illustration, from 1994 to 2004 operating revenues of World Wildlife Fund doubled (WWF, 2005) . Half of the revenue in 2004 was from contributions ($66 million), with $29 million from WWF members alone. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) has experienced similar growth (Center for Consumer Freedom, 2005) . In 1970 HSUS had an annual budget of about $500,000.

The development of markets for these services -as illustrated in the cases of carbon, wetlands, and water -brings the principles of capitalism to environmental protection (e.g., Hamilton, Bayon, Turner, & Higgins, 2007) . Another important trend is that the concern for environmental quality is increasingly linked to discussions about the need to deal with worldwide poverty (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005).

In these early times, ''citizens were portrayed as lacking knowledge to contribute to visionary conservation efforts'' (Witter & Jahn, 1998, p. 202) . As noted by King in 1948, it was ''becoming increasingly apparent that the knowledge and cooperation of the public is of fundamental importance in carrying out a well-rounded conservation program'' (p. 9). Given this view, the primary objective of interaction with the public was to provide education in order to ease the ''management bottleneck'' of the citizenry (Huboda, 1948) . Not surprisingly, some of the early HDW efforts focused on public relations and led to an early text on that topic by Gilbert in 1971. The latter half of the century was a period during which ''people problems'' began to attract the attention of researchers and managers alike. One of the earliest and most enduring HDW research efforts was the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation. This survey was first conducted in 1955 (U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, 1955) and has been conducted at regular intervals since then (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2007). The purpose of this survey has remained relatively constant over time: to track Americans' wildlife-associated recreation participation and economic expenditures. It was not until 10 years after that first survey that HDW investigations began to measure the attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics of various publics, focusing particularly on hunters and anglers.",

An explanation for the universal appearance of totemism in hunter-gatherer societies (see Chapter 7), for example, has been an enduring subject of debate among anthropologists (Willis, 1990) . Understanding human-wildlife relationships, as a theme deserving its own area of study, has been a more recent focus. Shanklin (1985) concluded her review of human-animal relationships in Annual Review of Anthropology by stating ''the investigation of human-animal relationships may well be one of the most fruitful endeavors in anthropology'' (p. 380). The journal Society and Animals, introduced in the late 1990s, is providing an outlet for these recent endeavors.",

            "text": "While earlier studies in anthropology had a theoretical focus, more recent studies have taken on a highly applied emphasis (e.g., Knight, 2004 ) that is consistent with a call for anthropology to become more applied and involved in environmental issues (Milton, 1996) . With a tradition of field work in preindustrial or developing societies and the co-location of these societies in critical areas of high biodiversity value, anthropology and geography are well suited to engage in analyses of social conditions that can inform conservation action. Little (1999) declared the applied involvement of anthropology in environmental issues its own field of study. This field has explored the rise of environmentalism as a social movement, issues of indigenous rights, and the impacts on parks and protected areas with regard to such topics as poverty, development, social structure, and location of power and self-governance. The field also examines ecotourism. Ecotourism is a form of economic growth that is consistent with conservation goals, yet it often creates undesirable impacts on indigenous peoples (Little, 1999) . Research on human-wildlife relationships in this applied area of anthropology includes topics related to the nature of human-wildlife conflict, wildlife damage compensation schemes, illegal trade of wildlife, co-management, subsistence issues, and the influence of global markets and policies on resource harvest. Another important trend from the anthropological line of research has been cross-disciplinary, integrative investigations (e.g., Galvin, Thorton, Roque de Pinho, Sunderland, & Boone, 2006 ). These studies model the complex interaction of social and biological forces to predict future conditions. These studies emerged from the cultural ecology and ecosystems traditions within anthropology and geography.",

AT has an international, cross-cultural emphasis, versus the tighter geographic focus of NAT. AT conducts work in association with NGOs, foundations, and development banks, while NAT's work is funded by governmental agencies charged with a more narrowly defined wildlife management mission. AT is more likely to employ qualitative research methods, whereas NAT is more likely to emphasize quantitative techniques. AT is more likely to examine issues pertaining to both domesticated and wild animal populations, while NAT focuses primarily on wild animal populations. Excluding the field of economics, AT's research is rooted in theory from anthropology and geography, whereas NAT's is based largely on theory from social psychology and sociology. AT is more likely to be engaged in cross-disciplinary research than NAT. AT often articulates an advocacy mission (conservation or animal rights) that is less apparent in NAT. Finally, aside from specialty conferences, the natural resources-oriented professional meetings for AT include those of societies like Society for Conservation Biology, The Society for Human Ecology, and the Ecological Society of America, while the corresponding organizations for NAT include The Wildlife Society, the American Fisheries Society, and the International Association for Society and Natural Resources, which is linked to the International Symposium for Society and Resource Management. I realize that the broad categorizations listed above have exclusions (e.g., economics, political science, and conservation psychology) and inevitably have individual exceptions. Regardless of their differences, these two traditions are contributing to an important understanding of human-wildlife relationships and are also helping practitioners deal with day-to-day wildlife conservation and management issues.",

In many cases, wildlife managers deal with governmentally owned resources that are managed by government agencies.

This doctrine, which can be traced to Roman law, proposes resources common to humans -including air; running water; the sea; and, in North America, wildlifeshould be held in trust for all people of the state. While the legality of public ownership of wildlife resources is debated (Bean & Rowland, 1997) , state wildlife agencies are heavily influenced by the public trust philosophy (Prukop & Regan, 2005; Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, 2006) . The doctrine is also often discussed in a more global context in relation to the management of natural resources (Sand, 2004) .",

Across the many studies that I have conducted, the managers I work with are frequently surprised to learn about the views of the stakeholders they serve. For example, I conducted a study for the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW) in the early 1990s to examine public values toward wildlife (Bright, Manfredo, & Fulton, 2000) . Findings had implications for CDOW's focus on regulating hunting and fishing in the state. Sales of hunting and fishing licenses are particularly important to CDOW because they provide a substantial portion of the annual operating budget of the agency. CDOW managers were surprised to learn from our study that about three out of ten citizens in Colorado did not support recreational hunting. How, you might ask, could these wildlife managers be unaware that so many people felt this way? In part, it is because our impression of others is formed largely through our interactions with those we frequently come in contact with. Managers are more likely to come in contact with the most vocal stakeholders or those who are directly affected by managers decisions, for example hunters and anglers. Past studies document this tendency and show that managers are often poor judges of the opinions of the general publics the managers serve (e.g., Gigliotti & Harmoning, 2004) . This fact underscores the importance of actively engaging in representative assessment and inclusion of publics in natural resource decisions.",

The preferred alternative is then implemented, monitored, and evaluated. While there are many positive aspects of this model, one of its criticisms is its emphasis upon extensive scientific information provided through studies or by the manager who is trained in science. This heavy emphasis on data generation can be seen in early proposals on wildlife planning by pioneers of wildlife management such as King (1938) . The fallacy of this approach has been the impossibility of obtaining complete information about the ramifications of a management decision. It also sets up unrealistic expectations that the manager could be the authoritative source of such extensive knowledge or expertise. As noted in Bailey, Elder, and McKinney's edited volume on wildlife conservation (1974, p. 577) , ''College training of wildlife biologists often emphasizes theory and the rational-comprehensive method of decision making.

What demographic shift might accompany the shift in habitable lands and lands available for agriculture? What will be the status of protected areas, and how effective will we be in preserving biodiversity? At what point will changing public needs make politicians look to protected areas to solve issues of scarcity of agricultural land, habitable land, and essential commodities? These are, indeed, difficult challenges for which, I believe, we desperately need the involvement of the social sciences. To illustrate, what we learn through the social sciences can help us: develop effective ways of communicating with and affecting the behavior of publics; determine ways to engage in effective action for the common good; develop political structures that can react more effectively to pressing environmental threats; understand the various types of services provided by biodiversity and healthy, functioning ecosystems, and help us establish mechanisms for sustaining these services; understand and avoid negative social impacts from resource uses and resource policies across multiple geographic scales; and, with the help of ecological and biophysical knowledge, predict future occurrences under different scenarios.",

At the individual level (micro level), human response to wildlife is seen as a learned response drawing upon a foundation of inherited tendencies such as anthropomorphizing. Human response to wildlife is based on a complex mix of emotions and cognitions. In the cognitive domain, human thought is viewed structurally as building from the basic (values) to specific (attitudes) with a strong influence from social group involvement (norms). At a societal/cultural level, the behavior and cognitive makeup of individuals has material and symbolic associations. The cognitive structure of people within a society is in an adaptive relationship with material factors such as economy, demography, and the environment.",

For the vast majority of human history, wildlife have been linked in some way to our survival needs including safety, security, shelter, and sustenance. It is highly likely that the nature of evolved human characteristics was shaped by the threats and opportunities provided by wildlife. Today, situations eliciting human responses of surprise and fear from wildlife encounters might be the most obvious examples of inherited responses to wildlife. However, it is quite likely that most human responses toward wildlife build upon a foundation of inherited tendencies. Co-author David Fulton and I explore research that suggests there are human universals that shape response to wildlife as well as the notion that heritability explains individual differences in human response to wildlife.",

While some theorists emphasize and define emotion by physiological reactions and responses, others emphasize the role of cognition and comprehension, or the role of culture in fashioning emotion. Emotion and related topics, such as mood and affect, have been overlooked as a topic of study during much of the twentieth century because they were seen as a deterrent to rational thought. More recently, research shows that emotion is an essential part of sound decision making. It also affects group processes and conflict resolution, the storage and recall of memories, and persuasion and attitude change. While emotion theorists often use wildlife-human interaction situations to illustrate emotional response (for example, a bear chasing a human), research examining human emotional response to wildlife is sparse. The experience of encounters with wildlife, people's attractions and interest in wildlife, and the intensity of conflict over wildlife are imbued with varying types and degrees of emotion. If we are to understand the individual meanings of wildlife to people, it is essential to attain a better understanding of emotion in human-wildlife relationships.",
