The monitoring of biohazards in the environment and the detection of pathogens in foodstuffs are also crucial to protect human health. Various procedures have traditionally been used to collect, isolate, and identify pathogens from different specimens and samples. In general, culture methods using differential and selective media are employed for isolation and identification. The identification is based on microscopic observation, colonial morphology, and phenotypic characteristics on isolation medium. Further, biochemical, serological, and molecular biology methods are employed for the definitive identification of microbial isolates. These established methods are often time\u2010consuming and labor\u2010intensive. For instance, cultivation on differential media and selective media might take days to weeks. Differentiation of clinical microorganisms to the species level might require as many as 20 biochemical tests. Consequently, the need for alternative procedures that allow the rapid and reliable identification of microorganisms is increasing. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool in biological research, and represents an attractive alternative to classical biochemical methods, especially for the accurate identification and classification of microbial species (Anhalt & Fenselau, 1975; Cain, Lubman, & Weber, 1994; Fenselau & Demirev, 2001; Lay, 2001; Demirev & Fenselau, 2008a).",

Viruses are ultramicroscopic and they must be cultivated within a susceptible cell. Unlike bacterial proteomes, viral proteomes are relatively small. Therefore, available biomarkers might be limited. The cell wall of Gram\u2010positive bacteria is more difficult to disrupt than that of Gram\u2010negative bacteria. Because of the resistance of spores, methods to identify them require germination and cultivation of the resulting vegetative cells. Microbiological analysis of a variety of samples generally requires specific approaches, as a first step, to isolate and culture the microorganisms. Liquid samples such as milk and body fluids might be directly cultured in media. Solid samples such as food are blended and diluted before culturing. Airborne pathogens should be sampled with an air sampler before further analysis.",

MALDI and ESI have both been effectively used for the accurate analysis of peptides and the determination of peptide sequences to identify and characterize proteins in microorganisms (Yao, Demirev, & Fenselau, 2002; Dworzanski et al., 2004).

Nanostructures have many characteristics that favor their use as selective extraction agents, and their small size makes them inherently effective as concentration agents. The field of nanotechnology has seen explosive growth in recent years, primarily because of the availability of new strategies for the synthesis of nanomaterials and new tools for characterization and manipulation (Curtis & Wilkinson, 2001; Levy et al., 2002). Generally, biological molecules such as proteins/enzymes, antigens/antibodies, and DNA/oligonucleotides have been immobilized on the surfaces of nanoparticles with supports of organic/inorganic and polymer matrices. Exploiting the unique electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of nanomaterials, bioconjugated nanomaterials provide a novel platform for the development of nanobiotechnology to identify microorganisms (Gu et al., 2003a).

PCR methods are particularly promising because of their high specificity and sensitivity. Although PCR methods are quite useful to identify microbial species, they cannot be used for classification, especially when the microbial identities are unknown. The combination of PCR and MS is an even more powerful tool for microbial identification; in some cases, it yields additional information that cannot be obtained from either technique alone (Sampath et al., 2007b). The ESI\u2010based detection of PCR products and MALDI\u2010based resequencing provide detailed genomic information that is useful in the rapid identification of microorganisms (Sauer & Kliem, 2010).

Various affinity probes have been used to concentrate and purify the bacteria of interest. Fenselau and co\u2010workers described the detection of bacteria from complex biological mixtures using affinity capture coupled with MALDI\u2010MS. They proposed an affinity method to trap traces of bacterial cells from complex biological mixtures with a lectin\u2010immobilized substrate. This technique offers a broad range with less\u2010selective recovery because many bacteria have lectin on their cell surfaces (Bundy & Fenselau, 1999; Bundy & Fenselau, 2001; Afonso & Fenselau, 2003). Recently, affinity surfaces modified with immunoglobulin G (IgG) or small peptides that were selected from phage libraries were used to isolate protein A from Staphylococcus aureus. The structure of protein A was identified with MALDI\u2010MS (Johnson et al., 2009). Over the past decade, a number of biomedical applications of magnetic micro\u2010 and nanoparticles of various sizes, shapes, and compositions have emerged (Berry & Curtis, 2003). Immunomagnetic separation has been widely used to reduce the detection time/suppression effect, and to improve detection sensitivity. Magnetic particles conjugated with a specific antibody can selectively separate a target pathogen from complex samples (Ochoa & Harrington, 2005). Voorhees et al. proposed an approach that used affinity\u2010capture techniques, such as immunomagnetic separation, to concentrate and isolate bacteria from complex sample solutions, which was followed with a MALDI\u2010MS analysis (Madonna et al., 2001; Madonna, Van Cuyk, & Voorhees, 2003a). The method involved microsized magnetic beads immobilized with affinity\u2010purified antibodies. The immuno\u2010captured bacterium was further infected with a bacteriophage (a lytic virus). Phage amplification occurred within the living bacterial cell and induced cell lysis. Many phage progeny released into the sample medium and detection of the phage capsid proteins from the medium indicated the presence of the bacterium. The detectable concentration was improved to \u223c5.0 \u00d7 104 cells/mL and the analysis could be finished within 2 hr. Because many antibodies and bacteriophages are commercially available, the approach has the potential to analyze species\u2010 or even strain\u2010specific bacteria and to improve their detection limit.",

Various carbohydrates have been recognized as receptors for the attachment of pathogens to epithelial cells of E. coli (Sharon, 2006). For example, mannose\u2010encapsulated gold nanoparticles have been used to observe the specific binding to a FimH protein of bacterial type 1 pili E. coli (Lin et al., 2002). The covalent binding between nanoparticles and targets is easily achieved with the self\u2010assembly of thiolated molecules on the nanoparticles (thiol\u2013metal interactions). Gu et al. developed a strategy that used vancomycin\u2010conjugated Fe\u2010Pt nanoparticles to capture and detect pathogens such as vancomycin\u2010resistant enterococci and other Gram\u2010positive bacteria or \u2010negative bacteria at exceptionally low concentrations (Gu et al., 2003a,b, 2006). They used optical and scanning electron microscopy to observe the captured bacteria.

Figure 2 shows the experimental procedure for the selective extraction and concentration of microorganisms with functionalized magnetic nanoparticles, followed by detection with MALDI\u2010MS. After functionalized magnetic nanoparticles are added to an Eppendorf tube that contains microbial cells, the suspension is incubated under gentle vortexing. The magnetic nanoparticles interact with the pathogens, and efficiently attach to them. The nanoparticle\u2010microbial cell conjugates are isolated by magnetic separation, and are deposited on a MALDI target for MS analysis. Chen's research group used functionalized nanoparticles to probe pathogenic bacteria (Chen, Tsai, & Chen, 2008). They proposed a simple method to fabricate IgG functionalized gold nanoparticles as useful probes of the electrostatic interactions between IgG and pathogens (Ho et al., 2004). The IgG\u2010modified magnetic nanoparticles, which bind selectively to IgG\u2010binding sites on the cell walls of pathogens, serve as affinity probes to capture targeted bacteria from sample solutions. The optimal detectable cell concentration of bacteria in aqueous sample solutions (Staphylococcus saprophyticus and S. aureus, 0.5 mL) and in urine samples (S. saprophyticus, 0.5 mL) was \u223c3 \u00d7 105 and \u223c3 \u00d7 107 CFU/mL, respectively (Ho et al., 2004). The same group used the IgG\u2010Fe3O4@TiO2 magnetic nanoparticles as photokilling agents that exhibit antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria under UV irradiation (Chen, Tsai, & Chen, 2008). They also employed vancomycin\u2010modified magnetic nanoparticles for the selective isolation of Gram\u2010positive pathogens (S. saprophyticus, S. aureus, and E. faecalis) from sample solutions. The optimal detectable concentration of S. saprophyticus and S. aureus spiked in a urine sample was \u223c7 \u00d7 104 CFU/mL (Lin et al., 2005). Recently, pigeon ovalbumin\u2010bound Fe3O4@Al2O3 magnetic nanoparticles have been used as affinity probes to trap selectively uropathogenic P fimbriated E. coli from bacteria\u2010spiked urine samples (Liu et al., 2008) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Liu et al., 2009) from clinical urine samples through disaccharide\u2013protein interactions. They have been able to detect peptide signal from 250 \u00b5L of samples at a concentration as low as 4 \u00d7 104 cells/mL, corresponding to 102 cells deposited on the MALDI plate. Guo and co\u2010workers utilized anion\u2010exchange/cation\u2010exchange magnetic nanoparticles as affinity probes to separate bacteria from water (Guo et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009). The positively charged nanoparticles interacted with bacteria (generally carrying negative charges). This approach was used to analyze various bacteria spiked in tap water and reservoir water with a detection limit of 1 \u00d7 103 CFU/mL in 2 hr.

LC\u2010MS is rapidly being developed as a tool in proteomics to deal with the inherent complexity of a biological system, and to complement conventional approaches that are based on 2DGE (Delahunty & Yates, 2005). Furthermore, LC\u2010MS has greatly facilitated the determination of the molecular weights of proteins from complicated mixtures. Krishnamurthy et al. (1999) used LC\u2010ESI\u2010MS to identify protein biomarkers specific to individual organisms present in crude bacterial mixtures. Lyophilized intact bacterial cells were suspended in 0.1% aqueous TFA (containing 0\u201320% acetonitrile) to lyse the cells and release cellular proteins or metabolites specific to an individual microorganism. Biomarker proteins and peptides were separated with reversed\u2010phase HPLC and a chromatogram of biomarker signals was used to distinguish bacteria. However, this work was limited by the complexity of the data generated from ESI. A solution to this problem was reported by Williams and colleagues with an automated data handling algorithm that provided sequential scanning, centroiding, and deconvolution of multiply charged proteins present in successive scans of the LC\u2010MS analysis (Williams, Leopold, & Musser, 2002). This approach has proven useful for identifying protein biomarkers of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Williams et al., 2004). The same group demonstrated a method in which LC\u2010MS was used to identify unique proteins that can be sequenced, identified, and reverse engineered into PCR primers that are specific to a desired phenotypic trait, thermal tolerance (Williams et al., 2005). Because the genome for Enterobacter sakazakii was not sequenced by that time, this methodology provided a unique, independent means to identify genetic differences among closely related strains of this species, without the need for any prior sequencing of the genome. Recently, Everley et al. discovered reproducible intact protein biomarkers with an LC\u2010ESI\u2010MS approach to differentiate and correctly identify unknown pathogens at the species (Everley et al., 2008) and strain level (Everley et al., 2009). The organism Bacillus anthracis was identified with the MS/MS analysis of an antigenic protein biomarker EA1 isolated with affinity chromatography and a monoclonal antibody (Krishnamurthy et al., 2006). Multi\u2010dimensional protein identification has been used to identify B. anthracis strains (Krishnamurthy et al., 2007). Ho and Hsu (2002) investigated with LC\u2010ESI\u2010MS the effect of variations in the protein patterns obtained from E. coli in bacterial identification.",

Figure 3 schematically depicts a proteomic approach to identify microorganisms based on MS/MS analysis. Microbial proteins are extracted from a cell lysate and digested. The peptide digests are LC\u2010separated, and are analyzed with MS/MS. The MS/MS spectra are checked against a proteome database to identify the proteins, and to deduce the source of the microorganism. Demirev et al. (1999) was the first to propose this method. Mathematical methods might be applied to evaluate the search results. Hu et al. proposed a method that used LC\u2010selective proteotypic peptide analysis (LC\u2010SPA) to identify the bacterial species in a complex mixture. Many pathogens were simultaneously identified from a series of selective MS/MS analyses of marker peptides in the appropriate elution time windows for the specific peptides. The SEQUEST application was used to check all of the tandem mass spectra of the peptides against the NCBInr protein database. This method successfully identified eight pathogens present in a microbial mixture (Lo, Hu, & Ho, 2006). Dworzanski et al. (2004) developed a method to identify microorganisms or protein toxins based on the LC\u2010MS/MS analysis of peptides derived from bacterial proteins. In their research, product\u2010ion mass spectra of peptides that were generated from a microbial protein digest were checked against the prototype proteome database (87 bacterial genomes) with SEQUEST, and the results of the search of the database were subjected to discriminant function analysis. Instead of matching peptide sequences to a microbial source in the database, Dworzanski et al. (2006) employed multivariate statistical methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis, to determine the peptide\u2010sequence similarities between the unknown species and a database of bacteria, grouped by their established taxonomic position. They classified bacterial species into corresponding taxons based on similarities. More recently, the same group reported on the classification/identification and genotyping of B. anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis strains based on the LC\u2010MS/MS analysis of whole\u2010cell protein digests (Dworzanski et al., 2010).",

(2004) separated and identified with LC\u2010MS most of the phospholipid species (phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, diphosphatidylglycerol, and a unique lipid compound, acyl phosphatidylglycerol) of a Gram\u2010positive bacterium (Corynebacterium species strain 8). The same group proposed fragmentation pathways and identified the diagnostic ions of two common bacterial phospholipid classes, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. They used LC\u2010MS and MS/MS methods to determine the structures of intact phospholipids from the two bacterial strains Pseudomonas nautica IP 617 and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, cultured on either ammonium acetate or crude oil (Mazzella et al., 2005).",

A limited number of articles have described the use of CE\u2010MS to identify microorganisms (Chong et al., 2000; Hu, Tsai, & Ho, 2005; Lo, Hu, & Ho, 2006; Hu et al., 2007; Petr et al., 2009). Hu et al. applied CE\u2010MS/MS to selected proteotypic peptide ions to obtain partial sequences of protein biomarkers. Proteotypic peptides refer to those experimentally observable peptides that identify specific proteins. Their proposed approach is a highly selective and sensitive analytical method to characterize the pathogens from microbial mixtures (Hu, Tsai, & Ho, 2005). They performed a preliminary analysis with CE\u2010MS/MS of the proteolytic digests of cell extracts from pure pathogens, and carried out subsequent database searches to select abundant peptide ions that were specific to the pathogens of interest. Minor bacterial species present in the complex mixture at even 1% relative abundance were identified with high confidence. They also applied this method to identify pathogens present in a saliva sample that had been spiked with bacterial mixtures. Further, the speed of data analysis was greatly improved because only selected markers, instead of whole\u2010protein digests, were analyzed. CE\u2010MS/MS analysis of proteolytic digests of microbial cell extracts has been combined with SEQUEST searching and a new empirical scoring system to identify bacterial species in microbial mixtures (Hu et al., 2007). The search results for 19 samples of bacterial mixtures revealed that the empirical Z\u2010scoring function improved the identification of bacteria in the mixtures. Petr et al.

Currently, most published studies of the direct mass spectrometric analysis of microorganisms are based on MALDI techniques (Demirev & Fenselau, 2008a,b). Direct bacterial profiling with MALDI\u2010TOFMS is based mainly on a comparison of specific mass spectra of the proteins, peptides, and other cellular components that are obtained from microbial cells. One of the first studies using this approach was based on the protein profiles of microorganisms (Cain, Lubman, & Weber, 1994). Although sample preparation is crucial to MALDI analysis of microbial markers, there is no universal sample preparation and measurement protocol. Many methods have been described since the method for direct MALDI analysis of bacteria was proposed. The experimental parameters studied include cultivation conditions, matrices, solvents, cell\u2010lysis, and matrix\u2010spotting methods. Microbial cells are generally obtained from a purified liquid culture or a single colony. Samples are analyzed by direct deposition of intact cells on the sample plate or using various ways of biomarker extraction. The MALDI matrices that most often used are \u03b1\u2010cyano\u20104\u2010hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA), ferulic acid (FA), and sinapinic acid (SA). HCCA provides better signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio than FA and SA. FA is suitable for the detection of high\u2010mass ions above 15 kDa. A UV laser is often used as an irradiation source. IR\u2010MALDI is rarely used to analyze microorganisms because of its somewhat lower sensitivity compared to UV\u2010MALDI. Although 5 \u00d7 103\u2013104 intact cells deposited on the MALDI plate were sufficient to obtain useful biomarker signals, the detected biomarkers were low\u2010mass ions (less than 1,000 Da). It has been reported that 106 cells yielded the most good\u2010quality and reproducible spectra for protein fingerprinting (Mazzeo et al., 2006).

Several methods have been suggested to overcome these difficulties, including disruption of the cell wall with enzymatic or chemical cleavage (Smole et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2003). Smole et al.

Welham et al. (2000) presented the first article on the use of MALDI\u2010TOFMS with different matrices to characterize various fungal spores.

Because of the complexity of mass spectral data, many statistical algorithms have been developed to match acquired spectra to reference spectra, or to generate fingerprints for microbial differentiation. The linear correlation of analyzed spectra and library spectra has been performed to differentiate among protein profiles from Bacillus spores (Dickinson et al., 2004). A fingerprint\u2010selection algorithm that is similar to a statistical test of significance has been used to extract key biomarkers from spectra. The constructed fingerprint library has been used to identify bacterial samples from three different laboratories (Wunschel et al., 2005). Keys et al. (2004) compiled a MALDI mass spectral database of over 100 genera and 350 species to characterize bacteria that are associated with human infectious diseases. Species\u2010 or subspecies\u2010specific markers in the spectra were sometimes difficult to identify because the number of overlapping signals increased with the number of strains in the database. Many multivariate analytical (MVA) techniques, including PCA, cluster analysis, and factor analysis, have been applied to analyze the protein profiles of bacterial samples (Chen, Lu, & Harrington, 2008). MVA is based on multivariate statistics, and involves the analysis of several statistical variables (m/z herein) simultaneously. Parisi et al.

A major advantage of this method is that the MS/MS spectra of biomarkers are obtained without the need for biomarker prefractionation, digestion, separation, or cleanup.

The protein/peptide identification approach overcomes the challenges of identifying components of mixtures of microorganisms (Warscheid & Fenselau, 2004). Warscheid et al. found that proteolytic digests are generated in situ from SASPs to enable microorganisms to be identified with microsequencing and a database search (English et al., 2003; Warscheid & Fenselau, 2003; Warscheid et al., 2003). SASPs are reliable biomarkers for spore\u2010forming microorganisms, such as Bacillus and Clostridium species, and allow the identification and differentiation of closely related species (Hathout et al., 2003; Warscheid & Fenselau, 2003; Warscheid et al., 2003). The same group obtained the complete sequences of the three most\u2010abundant SASPs from B. globigii with MS. They used a combination of MS/MS, chemical derivatization, ladder sequencing, and checking against a database to determine peptide sequences and to construct entire protein sequences (Whiteaker et al., 2004). Unfortunately, several of the identified peptides are common to more than one species of Bacillus, and make difficult the determination of their origin (Warscheid & Fenselau, 2003; Warscheid et al., 2003). This difficulty applies particularly when closely related members of the cereus group (B. anthracis, B. cereus, B. mycoides, and B. thuringiensis) are involved. Furthermore, the determined major SASPs of B. globigii and B. stearothermophilus are almost identical (Whiteaker et al., 2004). Focusing directly on the identification of species\u2010unique peptide sequences with MALDI\u2010MS and MS/MS analysis can help to achieve more rapid and automatable species differentiation. Pribil et al. (2005) used the direct scanning of species\u2010unique SASP tryptic peptides and modified SASP extraction procedures to discriminate between B. anthracis and B. cereus with either MS or MS/MS analysis. In protein\u2010/peptide\u2010identification approaches, spectral reproducibility is not critical as long as the observed spectra of the product ions are consistent with the protein/peptides sequences in the database. Positive identification will be hindered if the protein database of the analyzed microorganism does not exist, unless the protein/peptide databases can be constructed from experimental data (Yao, Demirev, & Fenselau, 2002).",

Aerosol MALDI\u2010MS can help detect high\u2010mass biomolecules and identify bacteria or other biological microparticles from their fingerprints. In aerosol MALDI, the matrix is introduced via either condensation or deposition on a matrix\u2010coated target (Noble & Prather, 2000). Aerosol MALDI differs from classical MALDI in a number of important ways (The differences include optimal laser fluence, matrix\u2010to\u2010analyte molar ratio, and choice of matrix.), and not just in the analytes (McJimpsey et al., 2008). Stowers et al. described the analysis of biological aerosol particles with MALDI\u2010TOFMS, and applied this method to B. subtilis spores. They observed a single biomarker ion at ca. m/z 1225 that was attributed to a peptidoglycan (Stowers et al., 2000). A new aerosol TOFMS instrument, which is used with laser\u2010induced fluorescence selection and MALDI, has been developed for the real\u2010time analysis of single bioaerosol particles.

In more recent studies, Kleefsman et al. used single\u2010particle MALDI to detect E. coli (Kleefsman et al., 2008) and Erwinia herbicola cells (Kleefsman et al., 2007). They stated that the instrument efficiency could be improved by the selective ionization of biological particles, following the observation of single\u2010particle fluorescence (Stowers et al., 2006; Kleefsman et al., 2007). Although useful spectra of a few thousands of particles containing bacteria such as E. herbicola have been obtained (Kleefsman et al., 2007), improvements in detection limit are still required for the analysis of real\u2010world samples.",

Hutchens et al. first described the original concept of SELDI (Hutchens & Yip, 1992; Hutchens et al., 1992). SELDI\u2010MS provided protein expression patterns from hundreds of samples in a single experiment (Thulasiraman et al., 2000; Diamond et al., 2003; Barzaghi et al., 2004). It is an affinity\u2010based MS method in which proteins are selectively adsorbed onto a chemically or biochemically modified surface. Seo, Kim, and Chai (2004) studied the protein\u2010expression profile in human macrophages that were infected by B. anthracis spores with SELDI\u2010TOFMS. Lundquist et al. (2005) demonstrated that SELDI\u2010TOFMS can generate unique and reproducible protein profiles for F. tularensis subspecies, to allow its subspecies to be distinguished from each other. Similarly, Seibold et al. (2007) identified single strains of the subspecies F. tularensis with SELDI\u2010MS. Huang and co\u2010workers proposed a method based on SELDI\u2010MS to identify Klebsiella pneumoniae and other related microorganisms by directly analyzing bacterial colonies without any protein extraction (Xiao et al., 2009).",

Seibold et al. (2007) differentiated single strains within the subspecies F. tularensis by combining SELDI\u2010TOFMS with cluster analysis and PCA. The artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm has been combined with SELDI\u2010MS to identify N. meningitides (Lancashire et al., 2005; Schmid et al., 2005) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Schmid et al., 2005). Schmid et al. analyzed over 350 strains of N. gonorrhoeae, other neisseriae, and closely related species such as Kingella denitrificans and Moraxella osloensis. They performed comparative 16S rDNA sequence analysis and standard biochemical tests to establish the identity of the strains prior to SELDI\u2010MS analysis (Schmid et al., 2005). ANN is an algorithm for machine learning, and represents a mathematical method that is not based on multivariate statistics. In the ANN method, the relative abundances at all m/z values are input to the input layer of the model. The model is trained, tested, and validated with bacterial samples. This approach has been applied to a blind dataset of 188 samples, and correctly identified 184 out of 188 samples (Lancashire et al., 2005). Yates et al. analyzed the volatile compounds of pathogens with quadrupole MS. Radial\u2010basis function neural networks successfully identified the unknown bacterial samples (Yates et al., 2005). SELDI\u2010MS allows more selective analysis of protein profiles than does direct MALDI\u2010MS. Useful markers might be selectively extracted and analyzed. The surface capacity of a SELDI probe plays an important role in the detection of markers. The capacity depends on the number of interacting groups and even the size of the markers. The markers that the SELDI surface captures are usually the abundant ones possessing specific interacting functional groups. Further, the ionization efficiencies of various molecules also determine the molecules detected in a mass spectrum. In microbial analysis, because SELDI is generally used to obtain proteomic fingerprints from microbial samples, the fingerprint data are useful as long as they are reproducible. However, just as for MALDI analysis, spectral reproducibility remains a key challenge in this approach.",

DART\u2010MS has been successfully applied to the analysis of fatty\u2010acid methyl ester profiles from bacterial cells (Pierce et al., 2007). The ionization process involves an interaction between electronically excited atoms or vibronically excited molecules and the analytes that are obtained by the thermal hydrolysis and methylation of bacterial lipids.

In Curie point pyrolysis, pure microbial cultures are dried in a suitable alloy foil and heated rapidly to the Curie point of the foil. The pyrolysates are immediately swept into a mass spectrometer and identified based on their m/z ratio. Then, the fingerprint or chemical profile of the pyrolysis mass spectrum is analyzed by suitable mathematic methods to differentiate pathogens. The first automated Curie\u2010point Py\u2010MS was developed by Meuzelaar et al. specifically for fingerprinting complex non\u2010volatile biological samples such as bacteria (Meuzelaar & Kistemaker, 1973; Meuzelaar et al., 1976). The mass spectra of pyrolysates are usually complicated because many large biomolecules decompose into small fragments. The cell envelopes of many bacteria have been analyzed, and various separation methods, such as HPLC, GC, and thin layer chromatography, have been developed for use with Py\u2010MS. So far, however, only Py\u2010GC\u2010MS has been commercially developed into a microbial identification system.

Although conventional biochemical analysis remains an important method in clinical microbiology laboratories, nucleic acid\u2010based methods have become popular in diagnostic microbiology. Genotyping methods to analyze nucleic acids might involve hybridization, primer extension, ligation, and cleavage, or a combination thereof (Monis & Giglio, 2006; Mothershed & Whitney, 2006; Klouche & Schroder, 2008). The device to read out the measurements can be a gel reader, a plate reader, or an array reader, among others. MALDI\u2010MS is considered to be an alternative tool to sequence DNA. However, some technical problems, such as adduct formation and limited sequence length, have led to the use of MS primarily to analyze DNA fragment profiles or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). ESI\u2010MS can detect large and multiply charged PCR products (Mayr et al., 2005). Therefore, accurate masses of the PCR products, obtained with high\u2010resolution ESI\u2010MS, have been used to determine their base compositions (Ecker et al., 2005). Generally, the mass spectra of nucleic acid products or their fragments are matched with theoretical ones in nucleic acid sequence databases to identify the species. The advantage and disadvantages of genotyping methods have been reviewed elsewhere (Sobrino, Brion, & Carracedo, 2005). PCR\u2010amplification methods are able to detect a few tens of microbial cells and might be applied to the analysis of non\u2010culturable microorganisms. The major procedures for microbial analysis include cell lysis, DNA extraction, amplification, and PCR\u2010product analysis. The sample workup time may be less than that for conventional culturing methods. Notably, some procedures are labor\u2010intensive and the PCR techniques might require additional steps to remove potential inhibitors from samples. The major advantage of using a mass spectrometer as a read\u2010out device, in addition to the speed of analysis, is its ability to measure masses of oligonucleotides. The molecular mass that is directly related to the nucleotide composition is more accurate than other sequence\u2010related parameters such as migration times.",

Restriction\u2010fragment patterns are obtained from digestion of the PCR products with restriction enzymes. The reduced size of the digested PCR products also favors ionization and mass analysis. MALDI\u2010MS has been successfully applied to differentiate microbial species by profiling the restriction digests of DNA (Taranenko et al., 2002). This method can detect hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) in human\u2010serum samples (Hong et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2005; Oh et al., 2008). It has been used to analyze as few as 100 copies of hepatitis B virus gene per milliliter of serum and differentiated among wild\u2010type and variant viruses (Ho et al., 2004). The limitation of these approaches in accurate microbial identification is the resolution of length heterogeneities of marker genes among species. von Wintzingerode et al. (2002) developed a method of microbial identification with the base\u2010specific cleavage of PCR products. Amplification of 16S rDNA marker sequences was followed by enzyme\u2010mediated fragmentation at T\u2010specific sites.

This protein marker might be used for the rapid preliminary detection of the resistance of B. cereus spores to antibiotics. Demirev et al. (2001) obtained positive\u2010 and negative\u2010ion spectra of proteins that were desorbed from Helicobacter pylori 26995 cells, a strain of bacteria that has been implicated in the development of gastrointestinal ulcers. Seventeen clinical and two laboratory strains of H. pylori have been analyzed from the direct protein\u2010fingerprinting method for quick species identification (Ilina et al., 2010). MALDI\u2010TOFMS has also been used to detect and identify Legionella species (which cause Legionellosis disease) (Pennanec et al., 2010) and human pathogens such as Bacteroides fragilis, which is frequently misidentified with phenotypical identification procedures (Nagy et al., 2009). SELDI\u2010TOF MS has been used to analyze 273 strains of staphylococci and other species isolated in a clinical\u2010microbiology laboratory (Yang et al., 2009). The authors demonstrated that SELDI\u2010TOFMS protein profiles of microorganisms include protein peaks that can be used to identify bacteria. Laser desorption ionization (LDI) MS has been applied to the detection of Plasmodium falciparum in blood samples from pregnant women (Nyunt et al., 2005). P. falciparum is a malaria\u2010causing protozoan. LDI of hemozoin inside the parasites generated heme ion and its fragment ions. MS detection of these marker ions represents malaria infection (Demirev et al., 2002; Demirev, 2004; Scholl et al., 2004).",

M. tuberculosis is often associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which has led to the increased prevalence of pulmonary TB worldwide. Recently, GC\u2010MS analysis of derivatized fatty acids obtained from microbial cells has been used for the rapid diagnosis of pulmonary TB in clinical\u2010microbiology laboratories (Stopforth et al., 2005; Cha et al., 2009). GC\u2010MS has also been used for the fast and accurate identification of M. tuberculosis in cultures and sputum samples that were collected from patients who were suspected to be suffering from TB (Cha et al., 2009; Kaal et al., 2009). The results show that tuberculosis stearic acid was detected only in the sputum specimens from patients who were clinically diagnosed with TB. Hu et al. applied selective CE\u2010MS/MS to identify specific pathogens in clinical specimens that had been collected from pus, wound, sputum, and urine samples. The bacteria in these clinical specimens were cultivated directly, without prior isolation of a pure colony, before the selective MS/MS analyses were performed. The total time taken to perform the analysis, including fast protein digestion and MS analysis, was 30 min, and the cultivation time was 6 hr. The identified pathogens included many species such as P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. agalactiae (Hu et al., 2006).",

The detection of SNPs with a MALDI\u2010MS\u2010based minisequencing method has been used to identify hepatitis B virus in HBsAg\u2010positive patients with chronic hepatitis B (Malakhova et al., 2009) and to detect drug resistance\u2010related mutations in N. gonorrhoeae (Vereshchagin et al., 2005) and M. tuberculosis (Ikryannikova et al., 2007).

The results provide important information for the therapeutic treatment of Acinetobacter spp. infection. Analysis of respiratory samples collected during respiratory disease outbreaks revealed high concentrations of pathogenic respiratory species, including Haemophilus influenzae, N. meningitidis, and S. pyogenes (Ecker et al., 2005). This approach has been used to identify 14 isolates of nine diverse Coronavirus spp., including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010associated coronavirus.

            "text": "Recent outbreaks, including the SARS outbreak that was caused by coronavirus and the H1N1 flu outbreak that was caused by a novel influenza A virus, as well as some biothreat incidents, reveal the importance to develop more rapid, sensitive, and accurate real\u2010time detection methods. MS has been successfully applied to the analysis of biomarkers from microbial samples. Many advanced methods for microbial analysis have been proposed. The MALDI\u2010MS fingerprinting of microorganisms has a number of advantages, including rapidity and ease of implementation. Construction of a large reference spectral library and the use of a fingerprint\u2010selection algorithm are critical to the success of the fingerprinting approach because of the complexity and the lack of reproducibility of microbial mass spectra obtained from real\u2010world samples. Identification of microorganisms through the sequence analysis of peptide or proteins markers might solve the problems associated with spectral reproducibility. Top\u2010down or bottom\u2010up protein identification methods can be used to analyze sequence information. Although the proteomic methods are limited by the number of available proteome databases, more and more microbial proteomes have been revealed and should broaden the applicability of these approaches in microbial analysis. Top\u2010down methods directly characterize proteins, and are, therefore, quick and simple. In bottom\u2010up approaches, the complexity of microbial biomarkers might be simplified with various chromatography\u2010based methods; although separation processes reduce the speed of identification, they provide significantly improved accuracy and selectivity. Furthermore, because the dynamic range is also increased, even a small amount of microorganisms in complex sample matrices can be identified. Most current microbial analysis methods require the culturing of the target cells to obtain detectable signals. The culturing time is by far the rate\u2010limiting step in rapid microbial identification. Reducing the detection threshold for microbial cells will be one of the major challenges in the future. Methods and instrumentation must both be improved to reach this goal. Cell enrichment through affinity techniques will also be important. Selective biomarker analysis with multiple reaction monitoring approaches coupled with affinity techniques will enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of microbial identification. The MS detection of PCR products from microbial genes might be an alternative means to improve the detection limit, especially in analyses of non\u2010culturable microorganisms. Advances in MS instrumentation and methods shall support a simple and accurate means of pathogen identification for environmental monitoring and clinical diagnosis.",
