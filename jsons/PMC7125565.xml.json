In response to this, a number of recent studies have investigated the potential benefits of using naturally occurring compounds as therapeutic antiviral agents against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (Marchetti et al., 1996, Isaacs et al., 1997, Seong-Ku et al., 1999, Carlucci et al., 1999, Wachsman et al., 2000). Previous studies demonstrated the presence of antiviral agents in milk (Matthews et al., 1976, Newburg et al., 1992). One such agent, lactoferrin, was shown later to inhibit the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), HSV-1 and -2, human cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, poliovirus and rotavirus in vitro (Harmsen et al., 1995, Marchetti et al., 1996, Marchetti et al., 1998, Marchetti et al., 1999, Superti et al., 1997, Swart et al., 1996, Valenti et al., 1998, Viani et al., 1999), highlighting the importance of naturally occurring proteins as antiviral agents.",

The introduction of negative charges into human serum albumin by chemical modification with polysaccharides, formaldehyde and aliphatic anhydrides yielded compounds with antiviral activity against HIV-1 (Jansen et al., 1991, Jansen et al., 1993, Takami et al., 1992, Kuipers et al., 1996, Kuipers et al., 1999, Swart et al., 1996, Swart et al., 1999). However, in a systematic study, Neurath et al. (1995) demonstrated aromatic anhydrides to be more effective in the conversion of natural proteins into negatively charged antiviral agents against HIV-1. The cellular CD4-receptor of lymphocytes, macrophages and monocytes was found to be the primary target for this inhibition. \u03b2-Lactoglobulin modified with 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride (3-HP) in higher concentrations, also binds to the HIV gp120 binding site on CD4 (Neurath et al., 1996). Additionally, 3-HP-\u03b2-lactoglobulin is active against HSV-1 and -2 (Neurath et al., 1998) and Chlamydia trachomatis (Jiang et al., 1997).",

The bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3) and the porcine respiratory corona virus (PRCV) were available at the Institute of Virology. All three viruses were titrated by inoculation of cells with 10-fold dilutions using the endpoint dilution method of Reed and Muench (1938). Vero76 cells, used to measure the antiviral activity against HSV-1, Madin\u2013Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBK) and Swine Testicular (ST) cells, used to measure the inhibitory effect of the chemically modified proteins against PIV-3 and PRCV, respectively, were originally purchased from ATCC. Vero76 cells and MDBK cells were grown in Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium (MEM) with l-glutamine (GibcoBRL) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS, GibcoBRL), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (GibcoBRL). ST cells were cultured in the same medium containing 1% non-essential amino acids (NEA, GibcoBRL) and 1 mM sodiumpyruvate (GibcoBRL). For cell-maintenance the foetal calf serum concentration was lowered to 2% for ST cells and to 0% for Vero76 cells and MDBK cells, respectively.",

Chemical targets of the 3-HP are the positively charged lysine residues of the polypeptide chain, which, after chemical reaction with 3-HP, becomes negatively charged. 3-HP-albumin, with its 59 negatively charged 3-HP-lysine residues, was the protein with the highest antiviral activity. 3-HP-\u03b1-lactalbumin possessing 12 modified lysine residues was five times less active than 3-HP-\u03b2-lactoglobulin, which has 15 lysine residues, when assayed after viral infection of Vero cells. Lysozyme having half of the lysine residues of 3-HP-\u03b1-lactalbumin had a higher antiviral activity in comparison to 3-HP-\u03b1-lactalbumin, nevertheless, it was strongly toxic for the Vero cells.",

(1998), has been confirmed extensively in the present study. We, therefore, wanted to know whether the chemical modification of the lysine residues by 3-HP would lead to an increase in the antiviral activity of peptide fragments generated by proteolytic digestion. 3-HP-proteins and 3-HP-peptides are instable and precipitate at an acidic pH. This makes their purification by reversed phase chromatography impossible, since this procedure is performed at an acidic pH. Thus, we decided to not directly digest the 3-HP-proteins, but to chemically modify peptide fragments present in the pools. Most of the 3-HP modified pools showed antiherpetic activity when present after the infection of the Vero cells and several of them were able to block the multiplication of the virus. However, all the 3-HP-pools examined were toxic for Vero cells to different extent. Since at the present stage of our research the single peptides of the pools with antiherpetic activity have not been isolated, it is not possible to say with certainty whether antiviral activity and toxic effects are due to the same molecule or to two separate entities.",
