The regions marked 5' and 3' were separately synthesized and cloned. It should be noted that the Clal site indicated at the proximal end of the 5' region is destroyed after ligation to the translation initiation linker in the final expression construct (see Fig. 2 ). ifying the coat protein of TMV Vulgare 13 , is shown in Figure 1 , and was synthesized as two halves, which were separately cloned for propagation in bacteria. The insertion of the 5' and 3' halves of the TMVCP coding sequence into the final bacterial expression vector is shown in Figure 2 . This construction utilized two double stranded linkers to adapt the restriction ends and to supply the remaining nucleotide sequences needed for the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acids. The final construct (pTMVCP) contained the entire TMVCP coding sequence located downstream from the lacUV5 pro-moter14.",

Evans et al., 15 described the location of an epitope on the VP 1 of poliovirus type 3 consisting of eight amino acids. To express this epitope on the C-terminus of the TMV coat protein, the pTMVCP expression plasmid was cleaved with Apal and BamHI to remove the small fragment coding for the two C-terminal amino acids (Fig.  2 ). This fragment was replaced with a double stranded Apal-BamHI linker coding for the two C-terminal amino acids, plus two glycine residues to serve as a spacer, plus the eight amino acids of the poliovirus epitope (Glu Gin Pro Thr Thr Arg Ala Gin). Thus the final construct, pTMVCP-polio 3, specified the expression of a modified TMV coat protein molecule containing an additional 10 residues at its C-terminus.",

Autoradiography revealed a product reacting with anti-TMV antisera in cells containing the pTMVCP expression plasmid, which comigrated with the authentic TMVCP from TMV virions (Fig. 3a) . A related product, which showed a reduced relative mobility, also reacted with anti-TMV antisera in the sample from cells containing the pTMVCPpolio 3 expression plasmid. The latter also bound antisera against poliovirus type 3 vaccine confirming the presence of a poliovirus epitope on the TMVCP-polio 3 product (Fig. 3b) . Purification of TMVCP and TMVCP-polio 3 from E. coli. Purification of TMVCP and TMVCP-polio 3 products was based on their self-assembling properties. Sonicated lysates of both pTMVCP and pTMVCP-polio 3 containing bacteria were dialyzed overnight (pH 5.0) to induce polymerization of the TMVCP products. Following concentration by ultrafiltration, the samples were each chromatographed on Sepharose 6B and the fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The peaks at the void volume contained only TMVCP or TMVCP-polio 3, indicating that the bacterially-produced TMVCP products polymerized in the extracts to such an extent that they each exhibited the highest molecular weight of any protein present (data not shown).",

A recombinant HBsAg gene containing a herpes simplex glycoprotein D coding segment inserted into its pre-S region was expressed in yeast resulting in the formation of HBsAg-lipoprotein particles containing a foreign epitope. A number of differences exist between the HBsAg system and the one described here. It is likely that the HBsAg molecule will be capable of carrying significantly larger epitope regions than the TMV coat protein. The former has been shown to assemble in vivo with a 300 amino acid insertion in its pre-S region. Preliminary results with the TMVCP system suggest that epitopes of this size no longer permit assembly. T his difference may not prove to be a disadvantage for the TMVCP carrier as it appears capable of carrying extensions long enough to contain the type of epitopes defined by experiments with synthetic peptides. A second difference is that while the hybrid HBsAg products are aggregated in vivo, the TMVCP-epitope products can be reversibly assembled in vitro by pH shifts. This will permit various TMVCP-epitope products to be mixed and assembled at predetermined ratios with or without the unmodified subunit to optimize the density of epitopes and to create multi-specific vaccines.",
