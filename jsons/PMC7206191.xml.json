Such a side information may be retrieved from social networks [9] and may include user demographic information, item attributes, and context information [26]. As the auxiliary data is useful for the recommendation systems [19], it is desirable to model and utilize heterogeneous and complex data types in recommendation systems. However, the traditional collaborative filtering techniques such as Matrix Factorization (MF) cannot deal with the above problems in a unified manner. Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) [1, 21], also known as a translation-based embedding model, encodes the side-information to improve the performance of Recommender Systems (RS) [16, 27]. He et al. [6] and Zhang et al. [27] employ the KGE model to represent users, movies, and movie attributes. The graph edges represent connections between users and movies in a knowledge base [6, 27]. However, previous studies do not offer insights on the following challenges: (1) how to construct a user-POI graph that utilizes the user check-in data with side information, such as spatio-temporal data and semantic context information, to leverage data sparsity problem; (2) how to effectively integrate a translation-based embedding model with a traditional recommendation system to improve the quality of POI recommendation.",

Existing studies on MF-based POI recommendations either focus on aggregating spatially-wise personal preference or exploring temporal influences. Most aggregation-based POI recommendation approaches fail to capture jointly geographical and temporal influences with the semantic context while addressing the data sparsity in an unified framework. In [22, 25], geographical locations are used to improve the performance of POI system which highlights that there is a strong correlation between user check-in activities and geographical distance. Geographical sparse additive generative model [22] for POI recommendations, Geo-SAGE, exploited co-occurrence patterns with contents of spatial items.

[16] proposed entity2rec to capture a user-item relatedness from KGEs with the goal of generating top-k item recommendations. Qian et al. [18] adopts KGE to model the side information in POI recommendation system. Their work only focuses on embedding the user and POI entities, and mapping the spatio-temporal patterns as a translation matrix. Although their work explored KGEs and RS, it did not integrate graph embedding with the traditional MF model. Compared with our proposed model that combines the spatial and temporal information with semantic contents in a semantic relation embedding space, these KG embedding-based recommender models have limited expressive abilities as they model the key parameters (e.g., spatial and temporal information) as a simple matrix. Finally, noteworthy is the family of Graph Convolutional Networks with models such as GCN [7], GraphSAGE [5], adversary GCN [20], kernel-based CKN [14] as well as generic graph embedding approaches such as DeepWalk [17] and Node2Vec [4] which all have the capacity to model graph-related tasks.",

Rank-GeoFM [8] is a ranking-based geographical factorization model in which the check-in frequency characterizes users\u2019 visiting preference, and the factorization is learnt by ranking POIs.

TransRec is the translation-based recommendation approach proposed in [6], which embeds items into a translation space and models users via a translation vector. Note that our proposed method is different from TransRec as we select both users and POIs as entities, and learn the embedding representation for a different type of knowledge as well as the spatio-temporal relationships.

Figure 2 presents the results of algorithms in terms of Prec@k, Rec@k and F1@k on Foursquare and Gowalla datasets. The figure show that the proposed GERec model outperforms all baseline models significantly for all metrics at different k values. Specifically, when comparing with the traditional MF models, GERec outperforms the Rank-GeoMF, which is the MF baseline with the best performance, by 50% and 47% in F1-score@10 on Foursquare and Gowalla, respectively. When comparing with translation-based models, our proposed model also improves the POI recommendation performance significantly. GERec outperforms STA, by 20% and 25% in F1-score@10 on both datasets. This demonstrates the capability of our graph-based GERec model to generate high quality POI recommendations. Although GeoSoCa exploits social influences, geographical locations and user interests, the simple kernel density estimation results in the poor performance. This validates the effectiveness of our GERec solution, especially our proposed step which exploits and integrates the user-POI interactions and spatio-temporal patterns to tackle the sparsity in the user-POI check-in data. The learned embeddings are well integrated into the combined matrix factorization model. Thus, GERec achieves the best performance among all compared baseline models. The user-POI graph constructed from Gowalla dataset has fewer relation edges than the Foursquare graph, as Gowalla relation patterns \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$r_{tl}$$\\end{document} have fewer regions in the relation paths than Foursquare.",

Specifically, we create multiple datasets with various sparsity levels by reducing the amount of training data randomly by 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of the total amount of data (before the cut-off date), and at the same time keeping the test data the same. The results on both Foursquare and Gowalla are shown in the Fig. 3. Specifically, the 0 in the horizontal axis presents the experiment result without reducing the training data. We observe that the Precision@k and Recall@k value decrease for all baseline models. For example, the performance of these models in terms of Prec@10 decreases at least 40% on Foursquare when reducing 40% of the training data. Results of the ST-LDA drop significantly compared with the other baseline models with 37% drop in Rec@10 on both Foursquare and Gowalla, which indicates that the LDA-based model is sensitive to the sparse data. The PMF does not change much, however, it remains the least accurate result. The Rec@10 values of RankGeoMF, TransRec, and STA show a 42%, 41%, and 37% drop, respectively. The GERec drops by only 34%, which illustrates that our proposed model is more stable and robust under sparsity than the baselines.\n",

Table 2 shows the impact of the length of time slot on Precision@k and Recall@k. The length of the time slot affects the quality of POI recommendations. When the length of time slot changes, the relation paths change and the entire graph needs to be computed again. We split day activities into different lengths. The parameter h denotes the length of each time slot in hours. The larger length of time slot the less the time influence on recommendation results. We report the top-k recommendation precision and recall for each time slot on the Foursquare and Gowalla datasets. From the experimental results we observe that the POI recommendation accuracy improves when the time slot length increases. The recommendation accuracy reaches a peak point for 8 h long time slot. Then, it starts decreasing as the time slot keeps increasing. The reason for the improved accuracy is that the larger time length, the denser the data. Hence, there are more user check-in records at each time slot for generating recommendations. However, the recommendation accuracy decreases as the length of the time slot reaches 8 h. This is because when the length of the time slot is large enough, it may reduce the influence of temporal pattern. Moreover, we study the impact of varying dimension d of the relation embedding by setting it to \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\{70, 80, 90, 100, 120\\}$$\\end{document} (Table 3).

To overcome the sparsity of the user-POI interaction data, we develop an embedding function which bridges gaps between the translation-based embedding model and traditional MF-based model. The user-POI graph is integrated with a combined MF model to improve the quality of POI recommendations.",
