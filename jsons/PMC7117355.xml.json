Similar to other coronaviruses, the 5\u2032 two thirds of the IBV genome encodes two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and the latter is an extension product of pp1a as a result of a \u22121 frameshifting (Almazan et al., 2004, Brierley et al., 1989). The remaining one third of the genome encodes the structural proteins and group-specific ORFs, including spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N), which are essential for replication of the virus (Armesto et al., 2009, Fang et al., 2007, Youn et al., 2005). In addition, IBV also encodes a set of accessory proteins of unknown function that may be absent in some strains and not essential for virus replication in vitro (Armesto et al., 2009, Casais et al., 2005, Hodgson et al., 2006, Youn et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The reverse genetic system for IBV was firstly established using vaccinia vector (Casais et al., 2001). Subsequently, a more elegant protocol to obtain viral infectious RNA was developed. In this system, full-length viral cDNA was assembled in vitro by orderly ligating viral genomic cDNA fragments and directly used as DNA template for reverse transcription of viral infectious RNA. The new technique was successfully applied to the studies on the role of accessory genes in viral replication (Youn et al., 2005), virulence determinant of Beaudette strain (Fang et al., 2007) and the relationship between S gene and tissue tropism of the virus (Britton et al., 2006, Casais et al., 2001, Casais et al., 2003, Casais et al., 2005, Youn et al., 2005). However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing reverse genetics systems for IBV were based on Vero cell-adapted Beaudette strain, which was considered to be poorly immunogenic and never used as a vaccine strain (Geilhausen et al., 1973). Therefore, application of the reverse genetics techniques to other strains including vaccine strains could improve the technique on modification of viral genome and provide a powerful tool for novel vaccine development.",

Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript III (Invitrogen). The IBV-H120 sequence (GenBank, accession number FJ888351) was used for primer design and nucleotide sequencing. Each DNA fragment was amplified from cDNA templates by PCR using KOD plus polymerase (Toyobo, Japan). PCR primer pairs used to amplify genomic regions are listed in Table 1\n. PCR amplification of cDNA fragments was performed in the following conditions: denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, 25 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 2\u20136 min depending on the size of the products and final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR products were isolated from agarose gels and TA-cloned into pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan), according to the manufacturer's directions. The entire nucleocapsid (N) ORF, including the 3\u2032-UTR, was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from H120-infected allantoic fluid, and the RT-PCR product was also cloned into pMD19-T vector. In order to transcribe RNA by using T7 RNA polymerase, T7 promoter sequence was incorporated to 5\u2032 end primers of F1 and N-3\u2032 fragments. In addition, a silent nucleotide change of A to T at position 20,132 nt was incorporated in to F10F primer as a molecular marker. To determine the consensus clone, two to four independent clones of each amplicon were sequenced by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd. Each amplicon that represents the consensus sequence of IBV-H120 was then released from cloning vector by restriction enzyme digestion and recovered for construction of the full-length IBV genome in vitro. Briefly, the plasmid carrying F1 amplicon was digested with Sal I and Nci I, and treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP: TaKaRa), before digesting with the BsmB I; the plasmid with F13 amplicon was digested with Xho I, CIAP treated and digested with BsmBI; the plasmids carrying amplicons F2 and F10 were digested with Nci I and BsmB I; and the other plasmids inserted amplicon F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F11 and F12, were digested with BsaI. All the digested plasmids were separated on 0.8% agarose gels and the bands corresponding to each amplicon were cut from the gels and purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). The cDNA amplicons were ligated orderly with T4 DNA ligase as following: (1) ligation of the amplicons into four fragments (F1 + F2 + F3, F4 + F5 + F6, F7 + F8 + F9, and F10 + F11 + F12 + F13) in equal mole ratio and recovering the appropriately sized four fragments from 1% agarose gels and (2) ligation of the four fragments into full-length IBV genome (Fig. 1\n). The final ligation product was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), precipitated with ethanol, and detected by electrophoresis on 0.4% agarose gel.",

Although this segmentation strategy can decrease the number of cDNA fragments and is easier to link to full-lengthen cDNA, it is difficult to get the longer PCR product with correct sequence and clone these cDNA fragments. In addition, the recombined plasmid containing larger fragments may be harmful to host bacteria, resulting some of them could not replicate in Escherichia coli host cells. In order to solve these problems, certain modifications for assembling of IBV genomic RNA in vitro were made to improve the efficiency of generating full-length cDNA. In this study, two improvements for assembly of full-length viral genome were applied. At first, the IBV genome was cloned as thirteen 1.5\u20132.8 kb fragments. The shortened length of cDNA fragments made them easier to clone, with less sequence mutation in each fragment and more stable in bacteria. Secondly, three or four fragments were ligated in one T4 DNA ligase reaction to reduce the number of recovery times which was negative correlated to DNA recovery rate from agarose gels.",

In this study, we were established a reverse genetics system based on H120 strain of IBV, a worldwide used attenuated live vaccine strain of Massachusetts (Mass) serotype. In China, H120 is always considered as the first vaccine selection. Compared with the Vero cell-adapted Beaudette strain, H120 can be developed as the vaccine vector to express other antigens since it has a stronger immunogenicity than that of Beaudette strain, although the latter was a widely used model of IBV on reverse genetics study and never considered as a vaccine strain (Geilhausen et al., 1973). According to the present data, the biological and immune characteristics of R-H120 including the EID50 and HA titer, growth curve and protection of immunized animals from challenge were all very similar to its parental strain H120. The same situation was found in other CoVs such as IBV Beaudette strain (Fang et al., 2007), MHV (Yount et al., 2002), TGEV (Yount et al., 2000), NDV (Hu et al., 2009) and avian influenza virus (Hoffmann et al., 2002, Jackson et al., 2008). It might imply that H120 was a good strain for the development of engineering avian vaccines. In addition, the 27.6 kb genome of H120 as a vaccine vector can be recombined with larger pathogenic antigen gene compared with 15 kb Newcastle disease virus vaccine vector, which was a vector used presently to express different pathogenic antigen genes as vaccine to protect the immunized animals from correspondence pathogen's challenge (DiNapoli et al., 2007, Nakaya et al., 2001, Veits et al., 2006).",

In our study, the continuous cell line, BHK-21, was applied to generating modified virus after electroporation, indicating that BHK-21 can be utilized to rescue virus from infectious RNA although BHK-21 was never used to replicate H120 virus before. At present, most IBV strains replicate in primary cells like CK and CEK and do not adapt to continuous cell lines (Casais et al., 2003). Therefore, in vitro assembly strategy is applicable to IBV strains that were not adapted to the commonly used continuous cell lines through the established approach in the present study. It is interesting to find that the rescued virus R-H120 and H120 viruses cannot efficiently replicate in BHK21 and make the cells emerge obvious CPE, but R-H120 do rescue from BHK21 cell. In next step, the S gene of H120 may be modified by reverse genetics to find out BHK21 adapted H120 that may reveal the information on cell tropism of the virus.",
