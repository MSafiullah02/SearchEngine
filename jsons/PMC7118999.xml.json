The genome of M pneumoniae consists of 816,394 base pairs and has been sequenced in its entirety [13]. Adherence to host respiratory epithelial cells is mediated by a 169kDa protein (P1) located in the tip-like organelle of M pneumoniae. Once M pneumoniae adheres to the mucous and ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, a chemotactic stimulus leads to directed motility of the mycoplasma to the bases of the cilia. This protects the mycoplasma from the clearance action of the ciliary system. A few hours after this contact, loss of ciliary motility is observed, followed by extensive damage to the host cells. It is likely that ciliary stasis and cell damage result from production of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide by M pneumoniae\n[14], [15].",

The outbreak was caused by a contaminated cooling tower, and cases occurred up to 1.3 km downwind [33]. The other major outbreak occurred in March 1999 in the Netherlands at a flower show [34]. Of the 77,061 persons attending the flower show, 181 developed LD [34]. The source of the outbreak was a contaminated decorative fountain. This outbreak allowed investigators to determine the risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, and the impact of adequate therapy on ICU survival for 141 hospitalized patients [35]. ICU mortality was 36% and overall mortality was 13%. Starting adequate therapy within 24 hours of admission was associated with significantly higher ICU survival: 78% versus 54% for those who started therapy more than 24 hours after admission. This finding did not apply to patients with negative urinary antigen, suggesting that bacterial load plays a role in outcome [35].",

In many careful studies of Chlamydia pneumoniae, it has not been the sole cause of the pneumonia.

Fifteen percent of the clarithromycin-treated patients were febrile at 5 days compared with 35% of the erythromycin-treated patients and none of the tetracycline-treated patients. In a retrospective review of 19 patients who had Q fever pneumonia, 11 patients were treated with erythromycin and eight with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.

They included original peer-reviewed articles published between January 1997 and April 2003 regarding adult patients hospitalized because of CAP and dealing with the question of whether treatment with a \u03b2-lactam plus macrolide or quinolone monotherapy reduces mortality or length of stay compared with \u03b2-lactam treatment alone. They found only eight of the 139 articles met the criteria for inclusion [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76]. Six studies found a significant reduction in mortality for patients treated with combinations of \u03b2-lactams plus macrolides or a fluoroquinolone alone [68]. Three of these six studies involved patients who had bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia exclusively, and mortality was reduced with the combination of a macrolide and a \u03b2-lactam [68]. In two of the eight studies, a reduced length of stay was noted for patients treated with a macrolide in combination with another agent [68]. Some have attributed the favorable effect of the macrolide combination to the coverage of atypical agents [68]. Only one study was prospective, and all were level-III evidence [77]. The beneficial effect of combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam and a macrolide may not be found in randomized trials.",
