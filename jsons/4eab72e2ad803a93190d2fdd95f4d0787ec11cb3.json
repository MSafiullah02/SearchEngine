            "text": "Manipulation of viral genomes is essential for studying viral gene function and utilizing viruses for therapy. Several techniques for viral genome engineering have been developed. Homologous recombination in virus-infected cells has traditionally been used to edit viral genomes; however, the frequency of the expected recombination is quite low. Alternatively, large viral genomes have been edited using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) plasmid system. However, cloning of large viral genomes into BAC plasmids is both laborious and time-consuming. In addition, because it is possible for insertion into the viral genome of drug selection markers or parts of BAC plasmids to affect viral function, artificial genes sometimes need to be removed from edited viruses. Herpes simplex virus (HSV), a common DNA virus with a genome length of 152 kbp, causes labialis, genital herpes and encephalitis. Mutant HSV is a candidate for oncotherapy, in which HSV is used to kill tumor cells. In this study, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas9 system was used to very efficiently engineer HSV without inserting artificial genes into viral genomes. Not only gene-ablated HSV but also gene knock-in HSV were generated using this method. Furthermore, selection with phenotypes of edited genes promotes the isolation efficiencies of expectedly mutated viral clones. Because our method can be applied to other DNA viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegaloviruses, vaccinia virus and baculovirus, our system will be useful for studying various types of viruses, including clinical isolates.",

To date, several techniques for viral genome engineering have been developed. For viruses with small genomes, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus, editing is relatively easy because small viral genomes can be cloned into plasmids. On the other hand, for viruses containing large genomes, including herpesviruses (1), coronavi-ruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and baculoviruses, homologous recombination in virus-infected cells has traditionally been used to edit viral genomes; however, the frequency of the expected recombination is quite low. Alternatively, large viral genomes can be edited by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli at relatively high frequencies once the viral genome has been successfully cloned into a BAC plasmid (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, cloning of large viral genomes into BAC plasmids is both laborious and timeconsuming. In addition, it is possible for insertion into the viral genome of drug selection markers or parts of BAC plasmids to affect viral function. Therefore, artificial genes sometimes need to be removed from edited viruses using recombination systems such as the cre-loxP or Flp-FRT recognition target systems.",

HSV-1 gE functions as an Fc receptor to host immunoglobulins and forms a heterodimer with gI (26, 27) . To determine whether the CRISPR-Cas9 system could be used to edit viral genomes, first an attempt was made to edit the gE gene by designing three unique 20 nt guide sequences followed by PAM sequences in the ORF of gE (Fig. 1a ) and then cloning them into a plasmidexpressing codon-optimized S. pyogenes Cas9 (Cas9) and a chimeric sgRNA (17) .These gE-or mock-targeting Cas9/sgRNA constructs were transfected into HEK 293 T cells along with a plasmid expressing human CD8 as a marker of transfection. When CD8 positive cells transfected with gE-or mock-targeting Cas9/ sgRNA were enriched and infected with HSV-1, high proportions of gE-negative cells in HSV-infected cells were observed in gE-targeting Cas9/sgRNA transfectants but not in mock-transfectants (Fig. 1b) . The proportion of gE-negative cells in HSV-infected cells was quite low when cells transfected with gE-targeting Cas9/sgRNA had not been enriched for CD8 positive cells. Therefore, enrichment of sgRNA/Cas9-expressing cells by using cell surface marker increases efficiency of genome editing by sgRNA/Cas9.",

ACV is phosphorylated by viral TK but not cellular TK, and phosphorylated ACV competitively inhibits viral DNA polymerase for deoxyguanosine triphosphate, resulting in inhibition of viral replication (28, 29) . TK-disrupted viruses were also generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system with the same procedure as that used to generate gE-ablated viruses (Fig. 2a,b) . Many ACV-resistant HSV-1 mutants were obtained from cells transfected with TK-targeting Cas9/sgRNA constructs, whereas only one ACV-resistant HSV-1 clone was obtained from cells transfected with mock-targeting Cas9/sgRNA constructs (Fig. 2c) . Almost half of the clones obtained from cells transfected with TK-targeting Cas9/sgRNA constructs contained the expected mutations in the TK gene when construct #515, which targets Cas9/sgRNA, had been used. Some clones (#515-2 and -3) contained in-frame deletions in the TK gene but were resistant to ACV. Because the region between amino acid residues 161 and 192 in TK is highly conserved among HSVs and is involved in nucleotide binding and homodimerization of TK, an in-frame deletion in this region might have significantly affected the function of TK. Furthermore, all clones were found to contain mutations in the TK gene after ACV selection (Fig. 2d) .",

Silent mutations were included in the repair ssODN sequence so that it would not be recognized by the Cas9/sgRNA constructs. Two days later, CD8 expressing cells were isolated and infected with gEmutant viruses (mutants #776-1,-2 and -9) (Fig. 1a,f) . Production of gE-revertant clones was evaluated by using flow cytometry to assess expression of gE on the cell surfaces as well as sequencing of the gE genes of each clone (Fig. 3a,b) . Revertants expressing gE with silent mutations were detected but no clone possessing the wild-type gE was identified (Fig. 3a) . No revertant was obtained when the repair ssODN was transfected without a pair of targeting plasmids. Generation by revertant viruses was less efficient than that by viruses carrying simple gE mutations (Figs. 1c, e and 3c) .

The gE gene sequences around the targeted sites of all five revertant clones generated with a pair of plasmids targeting gE (#745c) and gE (#793) along with ssODN were identical. Also, identical gE sequences were obtained from the two revertant clones generated with plasmids pair targeting gE (#754c) and gE (#793) and from all five clones with plasmids targeting gE (#760c) and gE (#793). The gE sequences outside the targeted sites remained identical with the parental sequence (Fig. 3a) .

Our procedure enabled us to generate HSV-1-containing specific gene mutations at a high frequency in less than 2 weeks (Figs. 1c and 2b). More than 50% of the HSV-1 clones generated by this system had the expected mutations when appropriate target sequences had been used. Because of the high efficiency of HSV-1 genome editing by our Cas9/sgRNA system, we could obtain the specific mutants apparently without unexpected mutations. However, not all targeting plasmids were highly efficient at HSV-1 genome editing. Indeed, gene-ablation efficiency was 33% and 5.8% when plasmids targeting gE #6 and TK #41, respectively, were used. Efficiency of editing viral genomes seems to be affected by the target sequence. Use of certain phenotypic changes induced by mutations enhances efficiency, as we have shown for mutations of gE or TK. Indeed, almost 100% of the viral clones had the expected mutations when the mutant viruses were phenotypically enriched by gE expression or ACV sensitivity. Therefore, generation of mutant HSV-1 using the CRISPR-Cas9 system is much more efficient than that using the conventional method, in which mutant viruses are generated by spontaneous homologous recombination in the presence of an extrinsically introduced gene. Although we did not edit essential genes that are involved in viral survival or infectivity, it may be possible to edit the essential genes by using HEK 293T cells and Vero cells transfected with the wild-type gene of interest. Although undesired \"off-target\" mutations have been of concern with the CRISPR-Cas9 system, off-target mutations might be decreased by using a mutated Cas9 nuclease that does not cause double-strand breaks but introduces a single-strand nick (30) . Use of mutant Cas9 might be useful for decreasing the off-target effect in viral genome editing. Recently, engineering of genes of adenovirus and HSV-1 by the CRISPR-Cas9 system was reported (31) . However, in the current study, we generated not only gene-ablated virus but also revertant virus from the gene gene-ablated virus, which is close to essential for studying specific viral genes. In addition, we assessed cells infected with mutant virus by flow cytometry to directly ascertain the effects of gene editing. Therefore, this study provides important information required for editing viral genes with the CRISPR-Cas9 system.",

In addition, this method will allow functional analysis of viral genes directly derived from the field or patients. Because we detected knock-in viruses in approximately 10% of randomly chosen clones without the use of selection markers, this system is useful not only for introducing genetic ablation into viruses but also for generating knock-in viruses. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is reportedly useful for editing HIV genome integrated into host cell genome (32) . However, these authors' technique differed from ours in that viral DNA genome was directly edited by the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Because HSV-1 mutants are candidates for clinical trials of oncolytic virotherapy, editing large viral genomes using the CRISPR-Cas9 system could contribute to generating mutant viruses suitable for therapeutic applications. In addition, this system can be further applied to other large DNA viruses belonging to the Herpesviridae, Poxviridae and Baculoviridae families, such as cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus and vaccinia virus. Furthermore, our technique will enable Fig. 4 . A His-tag was inserted into the gE sequence of wild-type HSV-1.

Cells infected with HSV-1 that acquired additional mutations are indicated as gE(\u00c0). Expression of gB and His-tagged gE on infected Vero cells was assessed by flow cytometry. The expression of gB was analyzed to distinguish infected cells from noninfected cells. Representative data derived from three independent experiments are shown.
