The effi cacy of 70% ethanol was equivalent to that of PVP-I products. Fixation of SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells with a fi xative including formalin, glutaraldehyde, methanol and acetone for 5 min or longer eliminated all infectivity. Heating the virus at 56 \u00b0 C for 60 min or longer reduced the infectivity of the virus from 2.6 ! 10 7 to undetectable levels.

Although the epidemic seemed to be controlled during the summer of 2003, laboratory-associated infections appeared in Singapore in September 2003, in Taiwan in December 2003 and in Beijing in April 2004. At the end of 2003, a new series of probable SARS cases, which may have been unrelated to laboratory sources of infection, re-emerged in Gangdong.

Fig. 1 . Kinetics of SARS-CoV inactivation by heating. Aliquots of SARS-CoV were heated in a 56 \u00b0 C water bath for the indicated times. The heated virus aliquots were serially diluted and inoculated onto monolayers of Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well plates. After incubation for 48 h, the cytopathic effect in the cells was observed and the infectivity was determined by the TCID 50 method.",
