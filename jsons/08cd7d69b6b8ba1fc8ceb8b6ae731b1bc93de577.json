            "text": "H canis infection (HCI), often referred to as Old World canine hepatozoonosis, varies from being subclinical and identified incidentally in apparently healthy dogs others 1993b, Baneth 2001) to being a severe and life-threatening clinical disease (Baneth and Weigler 1997 , Macintire and others 1997 , Shaw and others 2001 . The most common presentation of the infection in dogs is asymptomatic to mild disease, and it is usually associated with a low level of H canis parasitaemia in which 1 to 5 per cent of the animal's neutrophils are infected (Baneth and Weigler 1997, Baneth and others 2003) . Some dogs exhibit high parasitaemia, often approaching 100 per cent of the peripheral blood neutrophils, and severe illness characterised by fever, anorexia, weight loss, anaemia, ocular discharge, weakness of the hindlimbs and signs of chronic debilitating disease (Ezeokoli and others 1983 , Barton and others 1985 , Elias and Homans 1988 , Craig 1990 , Baneth and others 1995 , Baneth and Weigler 1997 , Macintire and others 1997 , Gondim and others 1998 , Baneth 2001 ). Common abnormalities found through laboratory analysis include anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis, hypoglycaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity (Barton and others 1985 , Craig 1990 , Baneth and others 1995 , Macintire and others 1997 , Baneth 2001 .",

The dog, from Aydin in western Turkey, had a four-week history of anorexia, weight loss, depression, gait abnormalities and fever after parturition. Vaccinations for canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, canine parvovirus, kennel cough and rabies had been performed regularly, but Leptospira and canine coronavirus vaccinations were incomplete. According to the owner's information, the dog had been infested with ticks during pregnancy and after parturition. One month prior to presentation to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, the dog had been seen by a local veterinarian who diagnosed it as having scabies and tick infestation. The dog had been given 200 \u00b5g/kg avermectin (Ivomec; Topkim) administered subcutaneously and an acaricide dip (Sebacil; Bayer). There was no response to this therapy.",

Results of serum biochemical analyses indicated low glucose and albumin concentrations, and high alkaline phosphatase activity (Table 2) .llll Skin scrapings for scabies mites and a faecal sample for parasite ova were negative. Based on the clinical findings and laboratory results, H canis was diagnosed to be the primary cause. The dog was hospitalised and treatment was initiated with a combination of toltrazuril (Baycox; Bayer) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Co-Trimoxazole; Phenix). Toltrazuril was given at a dose rate of 10 mg/kg, orally once daily for five days, along with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at a dose of 15 mg/kg, intravenously twice daily. B complex vitamins (Berovit B 12 ; Sanofi) were also administered intramuscularly for the first five days of treatment. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim; Roche) was continued orally at the initial dose for 25 days. Toltrazuril was added orally at a dosage of 5 mg/kg for 10 days from days 20 to 30 due to incomplete clearance of H canis gametocytes. The dog was monitored daily by physical examination and at 10-day intervals by laboratory examination for a total of 30 days. The animal was re-examined one, two and four months after being discharged from the hospital.",

            "text": "There is no agreement in the literature on the degree of pathogenicity of the organism, as H canis has been detected in leucocytes of clinically normal dogs in Africa (Ezeokoli and others 1983) , Japan (Murata and others 1993b) and Israel (Baneth 2001) . Therefore, some investigators consider H canis as incidental or nonpathogenic, unless the dog is affected by a concurrent disease (Ezeokoli and others 1983, Elias and Homans 1988 ). In contrast, Baneth and Weigler (1997) reported that parasitaemia with this agent is not a benign finding and should be addressed clinically because of the significant difference in haematological parameters and body temperature between H canis-positive dogs and healthy dogs. H canis induces a mild or non-apparent illness associated with low parasitaemia, whereas high parasitaemia results in a severe life-threatening disease (Baneth 2001, Baneth and others 2003) . High parasitaemia is defined by numbers that exceed 800 gametocytes/\u00b5l of blood, and in Israel (Elias and Homans 1988, Baneth and others 1995) and Africa (Ezeokoli and others 1988) affected dogs may have parasitaemias ranging from 20 to 90 per cent. The majority of dogs with high H canis parasitaemia show emaciation, lethargy and decreased appetite or anorexia, and are febrile and anaemic (Baneth and others 1995, Baneth and Weigler 1997) . On the day of presentation, the dog described here had a parasitaemia of 21 per cent of the neutrophils with 3284 parasitised neutrophils/\u00b5l of blood, and clinical signs were similar to those reported for dogs with HCI by other investigators (Craig 1990 , Baneth and Weigler 1997 , Macintire and others 1997 , Panciera and others 1997 , Gondim and others 1998 , except for a bloody diarrhoea. Bloody diarrhoea was reported to have affected half of the dogs examined by Craig (1990) , but was not detected in the case reported here.",

These findings are consistent with those previously reported (Barton and others 1985 , Elias and Homans 1988 , Craig 1990 , Baneth and Weigler 1997 , Macintire and others 1997 , Panciera and others 1997 , Gondim and others 1998 . The neutrophilia and anaemia observed in the case reported here are presumably secondary to necrosis and inflammation in the spleen, lymph nodes, liver and lungs (Gaunt 2000) . The mechanism responsible for thrombocytopenia associated with HCI is not understood. A mild thrombocytopenia in the case discussed here may be a result of general causes of thrombocytopenia, either in combination or alone (Rich and Coles 1995) . The decreased glucose concentration in serum may be explained by the effect of neutrophilia on glucose metabolism from the time of collection until the time of serum separation (Craig 1990, Macintire and others 1997) . Hypoalbuminaemia in combination with normal globulin concentrations occurs secondarily to selective loss of albumin, sequestration into extravascular spaces or decreased production (Kraft and Durr 1995, Rich and Coles 1995) . The hypoalbuminaemia detected at presentation of this dog probably reflects decreased production or chronic loss of protein. Increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity may reflect increased osteoblastic activity or hepatic lesions (Kraft and Durr 1995, Rich and Coles 1995) . The size, shape and staining characteristics of the gametocytes found inside the neutrophils of the dog are in agreement with reports by other investigators (Craig 1990, Baneth and others 2003) .",

Although the initial condition described in the current case is similar to that seen in some cases of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, co-infection with Ehrlichia canis can be ruled out since no E canis morulae were found on examination of blood smears. Furthermore, drugs with known efficacy against E canis do not include thrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and toltrazuril, which were used with apparent success in this case. The initial clinical signs were most likely not associated with canine distemper or canine parvovirus infection because the dog had been regularly vaccinated against these infections. It is possible that leptospirosis or canine coronavirus infection may have played a role in the initial condition of the dog because of its incomplete vaccination status. However, initial clinical signs did not resemble the clinical presentation of these infections. For these reasons, the current case was diagnosed as hepatozoonosis with apparently no interference from bacterial or viral pathogenic agents.",

UNER* Journal of Small Animal Practice (2004) 45, 613-617 A five-year-old female dog was presented with a four-week history of inappetence, weight loss, and skin and gait abnormalities. Physical examination revealed weakness, depression, incoordination of the posterior limbs, emaciation, skin and hair coat alterations, peripheral lymphadenopathy, pale mucous membranes and fever. Laboratory analysis of samples revealed abnormalities which included anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, low serum glucose and albumin concentrations, and increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity. The diagnosis was confirmed microscopically, by demonstrating the presence of Hepatozoon canis gametocytes within neutrophils in Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears. Treatment consisting of toltrazuril and a trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination was effective in relieving the clinical signs and clearing the blood of H canis gametocytes. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first detailed clinical description of H canis infection in a dog in Turkey.",
