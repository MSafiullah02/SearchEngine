Viral RNA was extracted from 200 \u00b5l of serum samples using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This kit does not exclude the extraction of DNA along with the RNA and no DNase digestion was used. Internal control RNA was spiked into each sample to check the RNA extraction efficiency. cDNA was then synthesized from the isolated RNA using the Reverta-L kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sacace Biotechnologies, Italy). Six different multiplex real-time PCR reactions (Sacace Biotechnologies, Italy) were then used to detect the following viruses: PCR mix-1 detects the respiratory syncytial virus and the metapneumovirus; PCR mix-2 detects parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3; PCR mix-3 detects parainfluenza viruses 2 and 4; PCR mix-4 detects human coronavirus (hCov) OC43, E229, NL63, and HKUI; PCR mix-5 detects the bocavirus and adenoviruses B,C, and E; and PCR mix-6 detects all 100 serotypes of the rhinovirus. All PCR mixes contain positive and negative control. All samples were spiked with an RNA internal control before nucleic acid extraction. A sample with a negative internal control result was not considered, and the extraction was repeated again. One negative control was run along the processes of nucleic acid extraction reverse transcription and real-time PCR with every group of samples. PCR was performed on the Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).",
