The incidence of VAP may have been underestimated given that microbiological samples were postponed when palliative care was decided, and some patients may have died with untreated pneumonia (or, similarly, with undiagnosed BSI\u2026). Immunodeficiency due to malignancies and anticancer therapies can explain the high rate of VAP in cancer patients. However, neutropenia did not appear to be a risk factor for VAP, which is consistent with other studies [10, 11].",

Our CR-BSI rate (2.3/1000 catheter days) is higher than those reported in the USA [14]. Mixing long-term and short-term CVCs in our study makes interpretation difficult: the REACAT study excluded long-term and pre-inserted CVCs. Interestingly, when CR-BSI secondary to long-term and short-term CVCs were examined in a post hoc analysis, a very similar infection rate was observed for catheters previously inserted when in the operating room (including totally implanted ports) and those inserted during the ICU stay. Unlike the steadily declining device-associated infection rates often reported [8, 15], our incidence of CR-BSI increased between 2006 and 2009 and then decreased to below 2/1000 CVC days (Figure S3, right). We focused on CR-BSIs because they are more sensitive to preventive interventions than central line-associated BSIs and more relevant for comparisons between ICUs [16].",

Surgery (scheduled or not) and leukopenia were risk factors for secondary BSI, which could be due to HIPEC, often complicated by leukopenia and peritonitis. Nevertheless, after excluding 1051 scheduled surgery patients (Table S11), unscheduled surgery and leukopenia remained significant risk factors. Mucosal barrier injury (BSI), due to neutropenic enterocolitis, is not preventable and is classified as a secondary BSI in our study: in this case, leukopenia is not only a risk factor but also the cause of the BSI. The fact that ICU mortality was not influenced by the occurrence of VAPs or BSIs means that nosocomial infections mainly reflect the severity of the underlying disease or of the patient\u2019s condition. Nevertheless, we had no information on the adequacy of initial antimicrobial treatment, a key point in mortality attributable to VAP [19]. Finally, the design of our study does not allow a detailed analysis of the real prognostic burden of each HAI on mortality; aggregation of data into broad categories, such as VAPs and BSIs, lessens the actual impact of some types of HAI on the prognosis. Thus, the occurrence of a deep fungal infection in a neutropenic patient obviously has a greater impact on the prognosis than a catheter-related fungemia, for example. Identifying the mortality indeed attributable to each HAI (rather to underlying conditions) would require further analysis and studies.",
