            "text": "The classical mammalian Borna disease virus (BDV) naturally infects horses and sheep (Herden et al., 2013) presumably through open nerve endings in the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa and is subsequently transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS). After initial infection, BDV spreads from the olfactory nerve into the brain, including the nucleus caudatus, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex and maintains a strictly neurotropic and persistent infection in immune competent end hosts (Herden et al., 2013). The resulting Borna disease (BD) is a severe and fatal neurological disorder characterized by virus\u2010induced immunopathological reactions that lead to non\u2010purulent encephalomyelitis (Herden et al.,\n2013). Currently, curative therapy is not possible, and vaccination is hampered by the underlying immunopathogenesis. Viral transmission is thought to occur via secretion and excretions of infected animals in case of disseminated virus distribution, e.g. natural infection of clinically healthy reservoir animals (Bourg et al., 2013). The average seroprevalence of BDV\u2010specific antibodies in clinically healthy horses in central Europe reaches ~20% in endemic regions, whereas it is considerably higher in BDV\u2010infected flocks, although only very few individual animals develop clinically manifested BD. In addition to horses and sheep, BDV can also infect several other animal species, including rabbits, mice, rats, guinea pigs, dogs, chicken, cows and non\u2010human primates (reviewed in Kinnunen et al., (2013) and Herden et al., (2013)). Furthermore, avian Bornaviruses have been identified as aetiologic agents of proventricular dilatation disease, which occurs mainly in psittacine birds (Staeheli et al.,\n2010; Payne et al.,\n2011; Piepenbring et al.,\n2012). Bornavirus sequences with a homology of about 60% to the classical BDV have recently been detected in breeders of variegated squirrels suffering from fatal encephalitis and in a contact animal (Hoffmann et al., 2015). Moreover, distantly related Bornavirus sequences have been identified a number of other animals (Kuhn et al., 2015), and BDV\u2010like gene elements are present in the genome of several mammalian species (Horie et al., 2010; Fujino et al., 2014). These findings demonstrate that Bornaviruses are much more diverse, and the spectrum of infected animals is much wider than anticipated. Although antibodies interacting with BDV were isolated from blood of human patients with psychiatric disorders (Rott et al., 1985), no reliable link between a psychiatric disease and the classical mammalian BDV infection has been demonstrated (Arias et al., 2012; Hornig et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The virions of BDV are spherical, enveloped particles with diameters between 70 and 130 nm (Kohno et al., 1999), which contain a single\u2010stranded RNA genome of negative polarity (Briese et al., 1992). The genomic RNA has a length of ~8.9 kb and comprises at least six partially overlapping open reading frames (Briese et al., 1994; Cubitt et al., 1994b), which encode the nucleoprotein N (BDV\u2010N), X\u2010protein, phosphoprotein P, matrix protein M, glycoprotein GP and the viral polymerase L (Herden et al., 2013). Because of the organization of its genome, BDV has been classified into the order Mononegavirales (Briese et al., 1994; Cubitt et al., 1994b), where it constitutes the prototypic member of the family Bornaviridae, numerous new members of which have been identified in recent years. Unusual among the Mononegavirales, the genome of BDV is transcribed in the nucleus (Briese et al., 1992; Cubitt and de la Torre, 1994a), and gene expression is regulated by differential splicing, transcriptional read\u2010through and limited nuclear export of viral mRNAs (Briese et al., 1994; Cubitt et al., 1994c; Schneider et al., 1994; Werner\u2010Keiss et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The replication cycle of BDV begins with receptor binding and fusion with the host endosomal membrane, mediated by the N\u2010terminal and C\u2010terminal cleavage products of the glycoprotein GP. GP is initially encoded as a ~57 kDa precursor protein pre\u2010GP, which is co\u2010translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane as a type I membrane protein. Cleavage of the signal peptide from pre\u2010GP yields the immature GP, whose molecular weight is shifted to ~94 kDa by extensive N\u2010glycosylation (Schneider et al., 1997). Early during the transport along the secretory pathway from the ER to the plasma membrane, GP is further processed by the host cell protease furin (Gonzalez\u2010Dunia et al., 1998; Richt et al., 1998; Eickmann et al., 2005). Furin is an endoprotease that preferentially cleaves its substrates at the C\u2010terminus of the consensus sequence Arg\u2010X\u2010(Arg/Lys)\u2010Arg or at the less common sequence Arg\u2010X\u2010X\u2010Arg. Its physiological role is the activation of numerous cellular proproteins, e.g. matrix metalloproteinase I, nerve cell growth factor, von Willebrand factor or insulin receptor (Seidah and Prat, 2002; Thomas, 2002). In addition, furin is exploited by a number of pathogens, including bacteria and many enveloped viruses, which utilize furin\u2010mediated cleavage to activate proteins such as bacterial toxins, viral membrane proteins or fusogenic glycoproteins (Thomas, 2002). In the case of BDV, furin cleaves the GP into the distal, amino\u2010terminal subunit GP\u2010N (51 kDa) and the carboxy\u2010terminal, membrane\u2010anchored subunit of GP (GP\u2010C) (43 kDa) (Richt et al., 1998; Kiermayer et al., 2002).",

GP\u2010N is exposed on the trimeric glycoprotein\u2010spike and binds to a still unknown host cell receptor, while GP\u2010C possesses all the characteristics of a viral fusion protein required for host cell infection (Gonzalez\u2010Dunia et al., 1998; Perez et al., 2001). While it is generally accepted that the incorporation of cleaved BDV\u2010GP into virus particles is required for initial infection of cells, studies have called into question the role of BDV\u2010GP for the subsequent cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread, which is presumed to occur by passage of non\u2010enveloped viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes in the CNS (Cubitt and de la Torre, 1994a). In contrast, other studies showed that virus spread is dependent on expression of GP and can be inhibited by neutralizing antibodies directed against GP, demonstrating the necessity of the glycoprotein for BDV dissemination (Bajramovic et al., 2003).",

We analysed virus dissemination in two cell lines differing in their capacity to release viral particles and used cultures of astrocytes as well as mixed brain cell cultures as natural host cell models, in order to determine general mechanisms as well as possible differences between cell culture systems. Furthermore, we show that a highly stable and efficient peptidomimetic furin inhibitor 4\u2010(guanidinomethyl) phenylacetyl\u2010Arg\u2010Val\u2010Arg\u20104\u2010amidinobenzylamide (MI\u20100701) (Becker et al., 2012; Hardes et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015) is an excellent tool to block cleavage and fusion mediated by the glycoprotein of BDV. Using this inhibitor, we demonstrate a strict correlation between BDV\u2010GP cleavage and successful spread of BDV. Moreover, our quantitative data show the dominant role of activated, fusogenic BDV\u2010GP for virus spread, indicating that interference with viral glycoprotein activation might be a feasible option to limit or inhibit spread of viruses employing cellular enzymes such as furin.",

However, other cell lines including Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, shed low amounts of infectious particles into the supernatants of cell cultures persistently infected with BDV (Stitz et al., 1998). These observations raise the question about the role of cell\u2010free virus for the dissemination of BDV infection and highlight the need for a comparison of BDV release from different cell types in a more quantitative way. Therefore, we examined the release of BDV from infected MDCK and Vero E6 cells, because both cell lines are similarly susceptible to infection by cell\u2010free BDV (Herzog and Rott, 1980). We first generated a Vero E6 cell line persistently infected with BDV by incubating non\u2010infected Vero E6 cells with virus isolated from the supernatant of stably infected MDCK cells. Infection of the cell layer was monitored by immunofluorescence detection of BDV\u2010N. After 18 cell passages, all cells were infected with BDV (data not shown). We then compared the extent of BDV release from both Vero E6 and MDCK cells. For this, we isolated particles from cell culture supernatants of persistently infected MDCK (MDCK\u2010BDV) and Vero E6 (Vero E6\u2010BDV) cells (Fig. 1A) and analysed them by immunoblotting. While the viral nucleoprotein N and the matrix protein M were readily detectable in lysates of both cell lines (Fig. 1A), both proteins could only be detected in the supernatants of BDV\u2010infected MDCK cells but not in supernatants of BDV\u2010infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1A). This shows that even though BDV infection is propagated in both cell lines, as demonstrated by the similar expression of BDV\u2010N and BDV\u2010M, Vero E6 cells infected with BDV do not release detectable amounts of virus into the supernatant.",

While the supernatant of MDCK\u2010BDV cells was infectious for non\u2010infected MDCK and non\u2010infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1B, left panel in diagram), both cell lines show an extremely small number of immunopositive foci after infection with the supernatant of Vero E6\u2010BDV cells (Fig. 1B, right panel).

The mixed cultures were grown to confluence in Petri dishes containing coverslips and incubated up to 7 days. Every 24 h, one coverslip was removed from each cell culture, and virus spread was analysed by immunostaining against BDV\u2010N (Fig. 2A and B). For both cell lines, we observed that infected cells appeared in clusters (foci) that grew in size with prolonged incubation. Furthermore, after longer incubation time, we only detected a very small number of secondary clusters, which contained a considerable lower number of immunostained cells (Fig. 2A and B). Because only single infected cells were present in both cell cultures at 24 h post inoculation, the larger foci specifically originated from primary infected cells, indicating that in both MDCK and Vero E6 cells BDV spreads primarily through contact sites between single, infected cells and neighbouring uninfected cells. In addition, for both cell lines, we observed only very minor differences in the number of infected cells per focus after 168 h of incubation, indicating that the extent of virus spread within the MDCK and Vero E6 cell cultures is comparable (Fig. 2C).",

Importantly, the cell viability was not affected by treatment of cells at 25 \u03bcM or even significantly higher concentrations of MI\u20100701 (Fig. 3C) (Becker et al., 2012).",

To verify whether the inhibition of BDV\u2010GP cleavage prevents the fusogenic activity of GP, we analysed the fusion activity of cell surface expressed BDV\u2010GP in the presence of MI\u20100701. For this, we measured syncytia formation when Vero E6 cells persistently infected with BDV were exposed to pH 5.5 for a short time, to simulate the low pH of the endosomal milieu. This treatment triggers fusion of neighbouring BDV\u2010infected cells (Gonzalez\u2010Dunia et al., 1998) only when cleaved GP\u2010N/GP\u2010C spikes are present. We observed that only infected Vero E6\u2010BDV cells formed syncytia when exposed to low pH (Fig. 4A). We then analysed syncytia formation between Vero E6\u2010BDV cells incubated with different concentrations of MI\u20100701 and measured polykaryon formation (Fig. 4B and C). Cell\u2010to\u2010cell fusion was significantly blocked by the furin inhibitor in a dose\u2010dependent manner and completely abolished after treatment of cells with 25 \u03bcM of MI\u20100701. This demonstrates that MI\u20100701 efficiently inhibits the fusion activity of BDV\u2010GP.",

For this, we analysed the effect of the furin inhibitor on the spread of BDV in mixed cultures of infected and uninfected cells. To discern cells originally infected with BDV (seed cells) from newly infected cells, we mixed MDCK\u2010BDV cells with a 100\u2010fold excess of non\u2010infected MDCK cells expressing fluorescently labelled sucrose\u2010isomaltase yellow fluorescent protein (MDCK\u2010SI\u2010YFP). The mixed cell cultures were maintained on coverslips for up to 120 h in the presence of MI\u20100701 or kept without inhibitor as a control. At different time points, individual samples were fixed, immunostained against BDV\u2010N and subjected to fluorescence microscopic analysis. Newly infected cells were identified by double fluorescence for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and BDV\u2010N, while seed cells were identified by positive immunostaining of BDV\u2010N and lack of YFP fluorescence. In the absence of MI\u20100701, the first newly infected cells appeared after 48 h in the nearest neighbourhood of seed cells (Fig. 5A), demonstrating BDV transmission from a cell persistently infected with BDV to neighbouring, non\u2010infected cells. With increased incubation time, we observed a remarkable increase in the number of newly BDV\u2010infected cells (Fig. 5A: without MI\u20100701). In contrast, when the cells were treated with MI\u20100701, we observed only a very slow and minor increase in the formation of double fluorescent cell foci over time (Fig. 5B: with 25 \u03bcM of MI\u20100701). Importantly, newly infected cells were always clustered around seed cells and in contact with each other (Fig. 5A and B). Furthermore, we quantitatively analysed the spread of BDV in MDCK cell cultures in the presence and in the absence of MI\u20100701, which demonstrated a significant reduction of viral cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission in the presence of MI\u20100701 (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these observations clearly demonstrate not only that the infection with BDV is primarily disseminated by cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread but also show that BDV\u2010GP is highly important for this spread via cell\u2013cell contacts.",

The mixed cultures were incubated for up to 23 days in the presence or absence of the furin inhibitor. At 2 and 23 days after seeding, individual samples were fixed and analysed for virus spread by immunostaining against BDV\u2010N (Fig. 6A), and the total number of BDV\u2010infected cells was determined (Fig. 6B). For astrocytes not treated with MI\u20100701, we observed an increase of BDV\u2010infected cells from 3% on the second day to a total of 38% on day 23 (Fig. 6B). Importantly, cell culture supernatants did not contain infectious virus (data not shown), which indicates that cell\u2013cell contacts are the primary route of BDV dissemination in astrocytes. In contrast to untreated cells, the quantity of infected cells for astrocytes cultured in the presence of MI\u20100701 remained nearly constant and increased only very moderately because of cell division (Fig. 6A and B). This demonstrates that the presence of fusion\u2010active, proteolytically processed BDV\u2010GP is highly important for the spread of BDV in rat astrocytes through cell\u2013cell contacts and in the absence of cell\u2010free virus.",

To analyse viral spread, individual samples were fixed at 8 and 14  days post infection (dpi) and immunostained against BDV\u2010N, and the number of infected cells was determined by counting a total of 200 astrocytes and 200 neurons per sample. For cells not treated with MI\u20100701, we observed a remarkable increase in BDV\u2010positive astrocytes over time (Fig. 7A, top panel). At 8 dpi, already 50% of astrocytes were infected, with a further increase to 70% BDV\u2010positive cells at 14 dpi (Fig. 7B). In contrast, treatment with 10 \u03bcM of MI\u20100701 resulted in a significantly decreased spread of infection (Fig. 7A, bottom panel) with only 12% of BDV\u2010positive astrocytes at 8 dpi and a very minor increase to 16% infected cells at 14 dpi (Fig. 7B). Importantly, infection seems to occur via cell\u2010to\u2010cell contacts because infected astrocytes were present as single cells early during infection and arranged in small clusters that grew in size over time in the case of non\u2010treated cells, whereas these clusters did not appear in samples treated with MI\u20100701 (Fig. 7A).",

It is notable that Vero E6 cells seem to be more susceptible to BDV infection (Fig. 1B) and form a slightly larger number of smaller infected foci (Fig. 2C), whereas MDCK cells, which release more infectious viral particles form slightly more larger clusters of infected cells (Fig. 2C). One can speculate that the virus uptake, receptor density and/or the viral replication machinery are more efficient in Vero E6 cells, but the mechanism for release of free virus particles is more efficient in MDCK, which leads to the formation of slightly larger foci. Similar observations for the strong difference in the ability to release infectious virus have been made for neurons and astrocytes (Carbone et al., 1993), and together with the lack of detectable, cell\u2010free virus in the CNS (Gosztonyi et al., Gosztonyi and Ludwig, 1995), this has led to the hypothesis that BDV infection is propagated directly from cell to cell (Herden et al., 2013). Our quantitative analyses show that infection is predominantly transmitted through direct cell\u2013cell contacts despite the cell\u2010type\u2010specific differences in viral release (Figs 2, 5 and 6). This indicates that cell\u2010free virus plays only a rather minor role during BDV infection and further supports the concept that cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread is the primary route of BDV dissemination, as schematically outlined in Fig. 8B. Other, alternative routes of BDV spread (discussed in the following) are also shown in Fig. 8.",

            "text": "Our experiments and the previous application of a less specific furin inhibitor on BDV growth indicated that furin and/or some closely related proprotein convertases (members of the eukaryotic subtilase family) are necessary for the cleavage of BDV\u2010GP (Richt et al., 1998). This raises the question whether other relevant proteases other than furin\u2010like PCs may play a role for the activation of BDV\u2010GP, for which there are no indications so far. The only known protease that cleaves BDV\u2010GP in cell culture assays is exogenously added trypsin. Other trypsin\u2010like proteases have not been shown to substitute furin. Trypsin\u2010like proteases, such as type II transmembrane serine proteases including HAT (human airway trypsin\u2010like protease), TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2), TMPRSS4, TMPRSS13 and matriptase are blocked by various inhibitors quite different from those that are specific for furin and furin\u2010like proteases (B\u00f6ttcher\u2010Friebertsh\u00e4user et al., 2013; Garten et al., 2015). It therefore seems highly unlikely that trypsin\u2010like proteases are suitable as activating proteases for BDV\u2010GP.",

This could be further substantiated by the observation that BDV\u2010GP can be detected in infected astrocytes only after lectin precipitation (data not shown). Surprisingly, we observed no effect of MI\u20100701 on the spread of BDV infection between neurons in the mixed culture system (Fig. 7). A potential explanation for this discrepancy to earlier observations (Bajramovic et al., 2003) is the relatively low concentration of MI\u20100701 in our experiments, which was sufficient to inhibit spread in astrocytes (Fig. 7) but might not be sufficient to completely inhibit GP cleavage in neurons. This might be due to the higher amount of BDV\u2010GP translation in neurons, as shown in the in vivo infection of rats (Werner\u2010Keiss et al., 2008) or due to differences in inhibitor uptake between astrocytes and neurons. Conducting experiments at higher concentrations of MI\u20100701, however, was not successful, because cell viability worsened at concentrations above 10 \u03bcM (data now shown), possibly caused by inhibition of the furin\u2010mediated activation of pro\u03b2\u2013nerve growth factor or other essential factors (Lee et al., 2001; Thomas, 2002).",

            "text": "The route via free infectious virus particles (illustrated in Fig. 8A) plays an important role for long distance virus spread to different tissues within an organism and for spread among other hosts between the same or other species. However, many viruses use different pathways without the need of free infectious virus diffusing through the extracellular environment. This mode of viral spread can be advantageous for persistent infections, such as BDV infection, in order to evade the defense by the host. Such mechanisms of virus transmission to neighbouring cells were recently demonstrated with influenza virus and parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) (Roberts et al., 2015). The observation that fusion\u2010active BDV\u2010GP is essential for the dissemination via cell\u2013cell contacts raises the question of how exactly GP mediates spread in the absence of cell\u2010free virus. It has previously been hypothesized that BDV is transmitted as non\u2010enveloped vRNPs (Gosztonyi et al., 1993; Cubitt and de la Torre, 1994a; Clemente and de la Torre, 2007) (illustrated in Fig. 8C), and a recent study showed the trafficking of viral components through contact sites between cells (Charlier et al., 2013). This cell\u2010to\u2010cell transfer of the core infectious viral machinery (RNP complex and polymerase) could occur through intercellular connections (tunnelling nanotubes) (Gerdes and Carvalho, 2008; Sherer and Mothes, 2008) in the absence of a fusion\u2010mediating viral glycoprotein (Fig. 8C), or through GP\u2010induced, local fusion events that would permit vRNPs to directly travel from infected cells to uninfected cells. Such a glycoprotein\u2010mediated transmission via microfusion has been suggested for the spread of measles and canine distemper virus in neurons (Young and Rall, 2009; Wyss\u2010Fluehmann et al., 2010). This mode of cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread not only facilitates rapid viral dissemination but may also promote immune evasion and influence disease outcome. Alternatively, BDV could be transmitted through short\u2010lived viral particles, which bud at close contact sites between cells and immediately bind and enter adjacent cells in a GP\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 8B), or are transported either in vesicles or as surface\u2010attached virus on the surface of tunnelling nanotubes, which enter the cell through GP\u2010dependent fusion. Such a mode of transport would be compatible with the absence of cell\u2010free BDV in the brain and has been observed for other neurotropic viruses, e.g. during the transsynaptic passage of rabies virus (Etessami et al., 2000). Interestingly, in BDV\u2010infected rat brains, uninfected neurons adjacent to BDV\u2010infected ones harbour virus\u2010positive dot\u2010like structures at the outer plasma membrane of their perikaryon, an observation that could substantiate former hypotheses. The transmission pathways described earlier either depend on a fusion\u2010mediating viral glycoprotein (Fig. 8A and B) or need no viral glycoprotein (Fig. 8C). However, a lack of detectable cleaved glycoprotein per se does not necessarily exclude glycoprotein\u2010mediated virus transmission as was shown recently for coronaviruses, where the cleavage of the glycoprotein S occurs shortly before the fusion of viral and lysosomal membranes (Burkard et al., 2014). Further ultrastructural studies of the events at contact sites between infected and uninfected cells would be helpful to clarify the detailed mechanism of how GP mediates cell\u2013cell transmission of BDV; however, the extremely low BDV production during infection might render such experiments nearly impossible and beyond the scope of this study.",

The observation that GP is essential for cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread, the main route of BDV dissemination in neurons (Bajramovic et al., 2003) and astrocytes (this study) suggests that the regulation of GP expression not only circumvents the antiviral immune response (Kiermayer et al., 2002; Eickmann et al., 2005) but might also be a key mechanism to regulate persistence and restrict viral spread through the brain.",

The importance of the glycoprotein for the spread of BDV and many other neurotropic viruses indicates that new antiviral strategies could target cellular enzymes that cleave these viral glycoproteins, thereby interfering with a basic mechanism necessary for viral spread. We found that using a stable and potent peptidomimetic furin inhibitors such as MI\u20100701 might be a suitable approach to target glycoprotein activation and suppress viral dissemination and possibly also the persistence of these viruses. The cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission of BDV mediated by cleaved BDV\u2010GP proved to be the dominant pathway of viral spread besides the minor transmission of free virus passing long distances. However, an intercellular transmission of viral RNPs in distinct cell types without the involvement of BDV\u2010GP cannot be entirely excluded.",
