            "text": "Five Cryptosporidium-free Canada geese (Branta canademis) were individually orally dosed with 3.5 x TO' Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts infectious to neonatal BALEVc mice. After intestinal passage, inoculum-derived oocysts extracted from goose faeces established severe infection in 14 neonatal BAL,B/c mice (inoculum dose 2.5 x io'/mouse). The inoculum-derived oocysts were detected in goose faeces up to 9 days post-inoculation (PI); the number of intact oocysts and oocyst shells shed during the first 3 days PI was significantly higher than for the remaining 6 days PI (P<o.or). Based on acid-fast stained air-dried direct wet smears, 62% of the oocysts in goose faeces were intact (oocyst shells constituted 3 8 % ) and conformed to morphological features of viable and infectious inoculum oocysts. The fluorescence scores of the inoculated oocysts, obtained by usc of the MERIFLUOR test, were identical to those obtained for the faeces-recovered oocysts (majority 3+ to 4 + ) . The dynamics of oocyst shedding showed that overall, the birds released a significantly higher number of intact oocysts than oocyst shells (P<o.o I ). Retention of the viability and infectivity of C. parvum oocysts following intestinal passage through a migratory water-fowl species has serious epidemiological implications. Water-fowl can serve as mechanical vectors for the water-borne oocysts and can containinate surface waters with C. parvum. As the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in source waters is attributable to water-shed management practices, water-shed protection programme officials should consider water-fowl as a potential factor enhancing contamination of the source water with Cryptosporidium.",

Pastures and grazing lands are recognized as significant sources of viable C. parvum oocysts (Coleman et al. 1989;  Hiepe & Buchwalder 1991; Lisle & Rose 1995) and during spring and fall migrations, thousands of water-fowl use these areas for feeding and resting (Fisher I 979) . Passage of infectious C. parvum oocysts through the gastrointestinal tract of a refractory avian host (Peking duck, Anus phtyrhynchos) does not alter their infectivity for mammalian hosts (Graczyk et al. 1996b ). Aquatic birds, which have unlimited access to surface waters, can therefore act as mechanical vectors by disseminating ingested oocysts. Although a free-ranging strain of Peking ducks (Mallards, A. platyrhynchos) occurs in the wild, it needs to be substantiated how the findings characteristic for Peking ducks arc applicable for typical and the most prevalent species o f water-fowl such as the Canada goose (Branta canadensis) (Fisher 1979 ; Anonymous I 996). whether C. parvum oocysts will retain their infectivity after intestinal passage through Canada geese. This species was selected because of its abundance in the wild (Anonymous 1996) . It is the most representative species of Anatidae, constituting a major component of water-fowl migration along the east coast of the United States (Fisher 1979; Anonymous 1996) .",

The retention of infectivity of C. parvum oocysts following intestinal passage in the avian host representing the most abundant water-fowl species in the USA is epidemiologically important. As most of the water-fowl's daily activity involves grazing on land and shallow waters with defaecation into the water (Combs tk Botzler i991), Canada geese may act as mechanical vectors disseminating infectious oocysts in an aquatic environment. When a single dose of oocysts was administered to ducks (Graczyk et al. 1996b ) and geese, the majority of oocysts were shed 48 and 72 h PI, respectively. Water-fowl which graze in pastures may ingest oocysts and subsequently shed the pathogen. avians in a n attempt to establish infections were unsuccessful (O'Donoghue 1995) , although in one experiment in I and 7-day-old chickens a weak, short-lasting tracheal (but not intestinal) infection could be established (Lindsay et al. ~9 8 7 ) .",

            "text": "The oocysts recovered from waterfowl-contaminated waters will produce IFA reactions similar to C. parvum even if other species of Cryptvsporidium are present. A certain consistency was observed in the patterns of shedding by ducks of inoculum-derived oocysts (Graczyk et al. 1996b ) and geese. The birds released the majority of oocysts within 2-3 days PI. In addition, the difference between the proportion of intact C. parvum oocysts to oocyst shells shed by ducks (73 and 27% respectively) (Graczyk et al. r996b) , and geese (6z and 38'X, respectively) was not significant. Based on the results obtained for Anus platyrhynchos (Graczyk et al. I 996b) and Branta canadensis, we conclude that water-fowl, particularly migratory ducks and geese which may abundantly reside in water-shed areas, should be considered as a factor facilitating contamination of the water with Cryptosporidium oocysts. Oocyst concentration in source waters is attributable to water-shed management practices (Hansen tk Cryptosporidium oocysts and sporozoites by cesium chloride and percoll gradients.
