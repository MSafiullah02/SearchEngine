Nociceptive sensation inducing her headache was experienced predominately in the frontal and maxillary sinuses bilaterally with small amounts of clear nasal discharge. The primary symptoms she was experiencing that were the most severe were cough, fatigue, rhinorrhea, and facial tenderness and pressure. On a numeric scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being the least severe and 10 being the most severe, she described her cough, fatigue, rhinorrhea, and facial tenderness and pressure as 10, 7, 9, and 7 of 10, respectively.

She performed self-care for the first 3 to 6 days of her infection by adding up to 5 cloves of Allium sativum to her breakfast and lunch and a few drops of a tincture of Origanum vulgare oil to water. She switched from the tincture to 200-mg capsules owing to difficulty tolerating the tincture. She ingested the capsules 5\u00d7 a day for 3 days and began supplementing with 100 mg of zinc and Emergen-C (Alcer Corporation, Carlisle, Pennsylvania) 2\u00d7 a day at the same time. All the supplements were purchased at a store specializing in vitamins and supplements and were not professional grade. She also received acupuncture twice that week for her infection. She experienced mild 1 to 2 of 10 improvement in her sinus pressure and nasal congestion, but her relief was transient. The patient is a full-time student who is highly active competing in amateur fitness competitions. She performs strength training exercises 5 days per week and endurance exercises 6 to 7 days per week. Her symptoms were preventing her from participating in her daily exercises, which affected her progress for her next competition.",

She was prescribed an antitussive and received a cortisone shot and also self-prescribed an over-the-counter decongestant and expectorant. Her infection lasted about 14 days.

Without knowing the exact cause, it is difficult to determine the reason that A sativum and O vulgare produced minimal therapeutic effects while G glabra potentially eliminated the infection. The patient had the infection for 11 days and had self-prescribed antioxidant and immune stimulating supplements and received acupuncture. It is not possible to know the effects these therapeutic modalities had on her immune function and possibly alleviating her infection. Each may have had positive effects on her immune system, allowing for the resolution of her symptoms, and the administration of G glabra may have been purely coincidental. However, this seems unlikely as the patient inconsistently took the supplements for the first 6 days of the infection and received acupuncture twice. She did not supplement for 5 days or receive acupuncture for 2 days before receiving G glabra.",

            "text": "Another limiting factor is that the resolution of her signs and symptoms was subjective based on a numerical scale. Because no instrumentation was used, the true improvement observed is an estimate and not an exact value. The addition of objective outcome measures would have increased the understanding of the effects of G glabra. Lastly, her previous cases of acute sinusitis typically resolved around 2 weeks. Because the administration of G glabra was on days 11, 12, and 13 of her infection, her immune system may have overcome the infection anyway. However, her symptoms improved very quickly after administration of G glabra, which usually is not seen with her pattern of sinusitis. Also, the fact that she has reoccurring infections every 2 to 3 months and she did not have another infection until 4 months later may indicate that it improved her immune function. In addition, the infection that occurred in October was low grade, and that she did not succumbed to another infection between November and January may indicate that G glabra was effective at alleviating her second infection. Further research is required to determine the efficiency of G glabra for the treatment of acute sinusitis and other viral infections.",

We hypothesized that G glabra may have resolved her symptoms by reducing inflammation and acting as an antioxidant or by acting as a cortisol regulator through its interactions with cortisol receptors. G glabra acts as an immunostimulant, expectorant, and antitussive agent, which also may have helped resolve the patient\u2019s symptoms. G glabra may be an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of an acute case of viral or bacterial sinusitis either alone or in combination with other antiviral or mucolytic agents.",
