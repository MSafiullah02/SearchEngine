            "text": "BACKGROUND: Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) are modes of non-invasive respiratory support commonly used after extubation in extremely preterm infants. However, the cardiorespiratory physiology of these infants on each mode is unknown. METHODS: Prospective, randomized crossover study in infants with birth weight \u22641250 g undergoing their first extubation attempt. NCPAP and HFNC were applied randomly for 45 min each, while ribcage and abdominal movements, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) were recorded. Respiratory signals were analyzed using an automated method, and differences between NCPAP and HFNC features and changes in FiO 2 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 30 infants with median [interquartile range] gestational age of 27 weeks [25.7, 27.9] and birth weight of 930 g [780, 1090] were studied. Infants were extubated at 5 days [2, 13] of life with 973 g [880, 1170] and three failed (10%). No differences in cardiorespiratory behavior were noted, except for longer respiratory pauses (9.2 s [5.0, 11.5] vs. 7.3 s [4.6, 9.3]; p = 0.04) and higher FiO 2 levels (p = 0.02) during HFNC compared to NCPAP. CONCLUSIONS: In extremely preterm infants studied shortly after extubation, the use of HFNC was associated with longer respiratory pauses and higher FiO 2 requirements.",

            "text": "In order to improve rates of successful extubation in extremely preterm infants, some form of non-invasive respiratory support must be provided after disconnection from the ventilator. 1 Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) is the most commonly used support 2 since it promotes upper airway splinting, improves functional residual capacity and thoraco-abdominal synchrony, and decreases work of breathing (WOB). 3, 4 Over the past years, heated and humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy has emerged as another mode of noninvasive respiratory support in preterm infants. 2 Although some degree of positive distending pressure can be generated, its main mechanism of action is through washout of the nasopharyngeal dead space. 5, 6 A few studies comparing NCPAP and HFNC after extubation found little to no differences in lung mechanics and breathing patterns (PATT). [7] [8] [9] [10] However, these infants were older and were studied a few days after extubation. Therefore, these findings cannot be extrapolated to extremely preterm infants during the critical period shortly after extubation. Furthermore, analysis of breathing PATTs was performed manually and in a selected number of breaths. Indeed, clinical evidence of HFNC safety and efficacy in this population is lacking, as a small number of extremely preterm infants were included in randomized trials comparing NCPAP and HFNC after extubation. 6, 11 Thus, a better understanding of the physiological effects of these modes of support following extubation is necessary in this population.",

In a crossover study, Saslow et al. 7 evaluated lung mechanics in 18 infants using RIP signals analysis. No differences in WOB were noted between NCPAP and HFNC. More recently, De Jongh et al. studied 20 infants extubated for \u226548 h and on non-invasive respiratory support. 16 Using a crossover random design, WOB indices were evaluated from uncalibrated RIP signal recordings of 2 to 4 min during four different modes: NCPAP at 5 and 6cmH 2 O and HFNC at flow rates of 3 and 5 lpm. Although statistically significant differences on WOB indices were noted between NCPAP and HFNC, they were not clinically meaningful, as suggested by the large overlap of the 95% confidence intervals. Differently from our study, infants were more mature and with higher weights at the time of recordings. Furthermore, analysis of the RIP signals was done in a selected number of breaths (over a shorter time frame) and did not provide information on respiratory pauses. In the present study, by using an automated and objective method, we were able to analyze all breaths. In another trial, Campbell et al. 17 studied 40 preterm infants with GA of 27.5 weeks extubated around the second day of life to either NCPAP or HFNC. APN was defined based on nurses' notes as a pause in breathing for >20 s and BDY as HR <80 bpm for >10 s, over a period of 7 days of treatment. Extubation failure was significantly higher in the HFNC group (60% vs. 15%, p = 0.003) and all infants were reintubated due to severe APN or increased frequency of APNs. The duration of the APN events was not reported. Due to the study protocol, we included a relatively more stable population, as 90% of the infants were successfully extubated. This selection bias could be the reason for the lack of differences in SYB and ASB breaths (WOB) or MVT (agitation and/or distortion) between the modes. Nevertheless, longer respiratory pauses were noted during HFNC therapy. Although small, such differences in respiratory pauses in combination with higher FiO 2 requirements may reflect some instability of the cardiorespiratory system during HFNC therapy after only 45 min of exposure and 30 min of analysis. As APNs and increased FiO 2 are the most common causes of extubation failure, 18 our findings raise concerns about the widespread use of HFNC therapy in this immature population as a mode of postextubation support.",

(c) PAU with BDY (PAU + BDY): PAU with a duration of 5-20 s + HR < 1 standard deviation from the mean, starting anywhere from the onset of PAU to within 20 s from the end of PAU. The objective of this definition was to include situations where a significant decrease in HR occurred during a respiratory event despite the HR \u2265100 beats/min. Cardiorespiratory behavior analysis For analysis of the cardiorespiratory behavior during NCPAP and HFNC, a total of 9 PATTs were included: PAU, SYB, ASB, and MVT (from the RIP signals); BDY (from the PPG signal); DST (from the SpO 2 signal); and the cardiorespiratory events APN, PAU + DST, and PAU + BDY. For each of these 9 PATTs, the following features were extracted: (a) Length of each occurrence: T PATT (s). (b) Total duration during the entire recording: T PATT TOT (s). (c) Total number of occurrences: N PATT TOT (#). (d) Frequency of occurrence: The total number of occurrences divided by the duration of the recording: F PATT = (60*N PATT TOT )/T TOT (#/min). (e) Density of occurrence: The total duration of a pattern divided by the duration of the recording: D PATT = T PATT TOT /T TOT (unitless). (f) Length of the longest occurrence: T PATT MAX (s).",

Importantly, 75% (15/20) of those infants who had a DST episode under HFNC also had an episode under NCPAP. The minimum FiO 2 required during both supports was 21% (p = 0.05) and the median FiO 2 range (i.e., highest needs minus lowest needs) was 2% [0, 6] under NCPAP and 5% [0, 10] under HFNC (p = 0.09). A significant difference was noted for the lowest and highest FiO 2 levels between HFNC and NCPAP (Fig. 4). HR: No significant differences in episodes of BDY were observed. Indeed, only a few episodes of BDY >2 s were identified: four patients (13%) during NCPAP and five patients (17%) during HFNC (p = 0.8). Of the infants who had a BDY episode during HFNC, 40% (2/5) also had a BDY episode during NCPAP. The median T BDY during NCPAP was 6.4 s [3.4, 12.2] and during HFNC was 5.7 s [3.2, 17.2].",
