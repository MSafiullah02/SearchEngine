            "text": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (AS-CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many industrialized countries. Multiple epidemiological studies have demonstrated genetic predisposition for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In the Framingham study, a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke or peripheral arterial disease was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk for CAD in man and 2.2-fold in women [1]. In individuals from families with premature CAD, heritability was estimated to be 92\u2013100 %, whereas within families with older cases the heritability ranges from 15 % to 30 % [2]. Despite the recognition of the genetic predisposition to CAD for many years, recent advancements in the genomic tools and techniques including high throughput genome-wide sequencing are leading to the identification of previously unrecognized molecular pathways. The first large genome-wide association study (GWAS) for CAD was published in 2007 and identified the association of variants on chromosome 9p21 and CAD [3\u20135]. In studies reported between 2007 and 2015, GWAS and exome-wide association studies have identified more than 60 significant variants strongly associated with CAD and MI, encoding more than 100 different genes [6\u201310].",

In theory, this approach offers a great potential for the discovery of new causes and mechanisms of disease. Once a putative causal gene is identified by human genetic studies, overexpression and knockout studies in animal models can be used to further establish the biological function and underlying mechanisms of such gene. Table 1 shows 61 identified loci with genome-wide significance (P < 5 \u00d7 10\u22128) by large-scale GWAS and exome-wide association studies. In the 61 CAD loci, only 15 loci were associated with the conventional risk factors and most loci harbor genes that have not yet been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Identification of susceptibility variants and translational findings from genetic variants can lead to novel therapeutic treatment for CAD (Fig. 1). This review will briefly discuss current biological approaches to identify the causal genes and pathways, functional studies to unravel the underlying mechanisms of disease, potential therapeutic targets to treat atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\n\n",

            "text": "First identified by Seidah and colleagues in 2003, the serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has been associated with mild to severe hypercholesterolaemia and an increased risk of CAD [12\u201314]. Sanna et al. sequenced seven genes associated with LDL-C in 256 individuals with extreme LDL-C levels, confirmed in a sample of \u223c10,000 Finnish and Norwegian individuals, and identified that rs11591147, which leads to a non-synonymous R46L change in exon 1 of PCSK9, is independently associated with LDL-C [15]. The mechanism by which PCSK9 gene defects cause autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is likely due to gain-of-function mutations. PCSK9 is a serine protease that binds to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A on the LDL receptor. Upon binding to the LDL receptor, PCSK9 initiates internalization and lysosomal degradation of the LDLR/PCSK9 complex, resulting in decreased LDL receptors on the surface of hepatocytes and increased LDL-C concentrations in blood. Loss-of-function mutations lead to higher levels of the LDL receptor, lower LDL-C levels, and decreased cardiovascular risk [16\u201318]. This phenotype has been confirmed by gain- or loss-of-function studies in mice [19\u201321]. Overexpression of PCSK9 diminishes LDL receptor protein and function, causing an Ldlr knockout phenotype in mice [19, 20]. Pcsk9-deficient mice showed reduced plasma cholesterol levels by increasing LDL receptor protein expression in liver and accelerating the clearance of circulating cholesterol [19, 21]. In apolipoprotein E (Apoe)-deficient mice, gene inactivation of Pcsk9 significantly reduced aortic cholesteryl esters. By comparison, overexpression of PCSK9 induced an accumulation of aortic cholesteryl esters and accelerated development of atherosclerotic plaque [19]. In Ldlr-deficient mice, overexpression of PCSK9 did not regulate the circulating cholesterol levels, aortic accumulation of cholesteryl esters and atherosclerotic plaque size, indicating that the pro-atherosclerotic effect of PCSK9 is mediated mainly through its action on the LDL receptor [19]. The PCSK9 transgenic pigs created by transposition of a human PCSK9 D374Y gain-of-function mutation displayed reduced hepatic LDL receptor levels, impaired LDL clearance, severe hypercholesterolemia, and spontaneous development of progressive atherosclerotic lesions [22]. Although PCSK9 gain-of-function mutations are rare, comprising only a small portion (up to 3 %) of cases of FH, the established mechanism has generated significant interest in the gene as a drug target. Both alirocumab and evolocumab, humanized monoclonal antibodies causing inactivation of PCSK9, result in large reductions in LDL cholesterol levels, as compared with placebo (39 to 62 % reduction for alirocumab and 47 to 56 % for evolocumab) [23, 24]. Although the potential cardiovascular benefits of these agents need to be further established, this newly confirmed pathway identified by human genetics has become a novel therapeutic target to lower cholesterol in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",

            "text": "In addition to Mendelian randomization studies, GWA studies have identified novel loci associated with CAD and LDL-C. One of the most compelling findings is a locus on chromosome 1p13, which is strongly associated with both plasma LDL-C and myocardial infarction (MI) in humans [25\u201327]. This region harbors seven genes, seryl tRNA synthetase (SARS), cadherin EGF lag seven-pass G type receptor 2 (CELSR2), proline serine rich coiled coil protein 1 (PSRC1), myosin binding protein H-like (MYBPHL), sortilin-1 (SORT1), proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, alpha type 5 (PSMA5), and synaptophysin-like 2 (SYPL2). Using expression quantitative trait loci (eQT) data, several groups confirmed that the minor allele for the SNP rs646776 and the major allele for SNP rs599839, were associated with low mRNA levels for SORT1, PSRC1 and CELSR2 in the liver [25, 28, 29]. Celsr2 is highly expressed in cells lining all cerebral ventricles and the central canal of the spinal cord [30]. Results from Celsr2-deficient mice indicated impaired cilia function and hydrocephalus, but there was not informative data regarding any effects in cholesterol level [30]. Musunuru et al. demonstrated that Sort1 overexpression led to a 40 % reduction in plasma cholesterol, whereas Psrc1 overexpression had no effect on plasma cholesterol using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)-mediated overexpression of Psrc1 and Sort1 in hyperlipidemic Ldlr-deficient mice [29]. Sort1 knockdown in mouse liver using siRNAs was associated with a 20\u201340 % increase in plasma cholesterol [29]. These results strongly implicated SORT1 as the causal gene at the 1p13 locus whose elevated expression confers reduction in LDL-C. However, Kjolby et al. reported different results using adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SORT1 and Sort1-deficient mice, in which Sort1-deficient mice show decreased cholesterol levels and reduced atherosclerotic plaque area [31]. Recently, Mortensen et al. demonstrated that transfer of Sort1-deficient bone marrow into irradiated atherosclerotic mice reduced atherosclerosis and systemic markers of inflammation without concomitant changes in total cholesterol or LDL-C, indicating SORT1 plays an additional inflammatory role in lymphocytes and macrophages potentially contributing to overall atherogenesis [32]. Although the SORT1 locus represents a promising target for the treatment of atherosclerosis identified by human genetic studies, these obviously conflicting findings in animals and the yet unsettled mechanisms behind the phenotype rises some questions on their immediate translation into the therapeutic strategies.",

The specific biological function of TM6SF2 is not clear. Kozlitina et al. demonstrated knockdown of Tm6sf2 resulted in decreased very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion and increased liver triglyceride (TG) content, which is consistent with human genetics findings in the DHS, Dallas Biobank and Copenhagen Study cohorts [33, 35]. Holmen et al. demonstrated that this variant in TM6SF2 influences total cholesterol levels and is associated with myocardial infarction (MI) [34]. In mice, transient overexpression of human wildtype TM6SF2 resulted in high total cholesterol, LDL-C and TG, whereas knockdown of mouse Tm6sf2 resulted in decreased serum total cholesterol levels [34]. Our results demonstrate that TM6SF2 is a critical regulator of cholesterol metabolism and liver-specific Tm6sf2 knockout mice challenged to high fat diet did not show increased liver triglyceride content [36]. Recently, a systematic meta-analysis in 101,326 individuals showed that carriers of the minor T allele are protected from cardiovascular disease, showing lower levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride. In contrast, carriers of the T allele showed a moderate increased risk for NAFLD [37]. Based on the opposing roles of TM6SF2 on both CVD and NAFLD, it is necessary to dissect the two functions of TM6SF2 before it becomes a therapeutic target to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction via lowering blood lipids.",

Among these genes only KLF14 and ANKS1A were solely associated with HDL-C levels and CAD. Teslovich et al. reported that variants at the locus containing KLF14 and TSGA13, which encode Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 14 and testis-specific gene A13, were associated with both HDL-C and CAD [41]. These variants were maternally restricted cis-eQTLs for KLF14 expression and strongly correlated with expression of several other genes in adipose tissue in trans, suggesting that KLF14 may be a master regulator of gene expression in adipose tissue and a key player in human metabolism [43]. Guo et al. demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of KLF14 markedly increased HDL-C levels and cholesterol efflux capacity through regulation of hepatic ApoA-I production. Studies of Klf14 knockout mouse models have confirmed the relationship between Klf14 and HDL-C levels [44]. Furthermore, Guo and colleagues identified perhexiline, an approved therapeutic small molecule presently in clinical use to treat angina and heart failure, as a KLF14 activator. Treatment with perhexiline increased HDL-C levels and cholesterol efflux capacity and reduced atherosclerotic lesion development in Apoe-deficient mice [44]. This finding was directionally consistent with the human genetics data showing that the T allele of rs4731702 located near the KLF14 gene was associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction and the T allele carriers have higher ApoA-I levels in the Mulao population in China [45]. These data were crucial in establishing KLF14 as a causal contributor to HDL-C levels and risk of CAD and led to a rapid effort to understand its function and the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein.",

In contrast, Trib1 deficient mice showed increased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels [61]. Recently, carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) and Sin3A (Swi-independent 3 A)-associated protein emerged as TRIB1 binding partners [62, 63], which may aid discovery of novel therapeutic targets for the management of dyslipidemia.

            "text": "In the initial Ottawa population of 322 cases versus 312 controls, a locus on chromosome 9p21 was identified to be associated with CAD [3\u20135]. This association with CAD was confirmed in diverse ethnic groups except for Africans. The 9p21 genetic risk variant is extremely common, with 75 % of humans having one or more risk alleles (50 % heterozygous and 25 % homozygous). The presence of a single copy or two copies of the 9p21 risk allele conferred a 15\u201320 % or 30\u201340 % increased risk for CAD respectively. In individuals with premature CAD, 9p21 homozygosis is associated with a 2-fold increased risk for CAD [4]. The 9p21 risk is independent of conventional risk factors such as cholesterol, diabetes, or hypertension, indicating that 9p21 exerts its effect via some novel unknown pathway, potentially leading to new therapeutic targets. However, the mechanism whereby the 9p21 locus confers increased CAD risk remains obscure. Whole 9p21 region deletion mice confirmed that the 9p21 region is a regulator of the Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, but the mice do not develop atherosclerosis [64, 65]. Fine mapping of the genetic risk locus at 9p21 shows that it consists of a cluster of 59 linked SNPs over a 53 kb region. The nearest protein coding genes are the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1A, CDKN2B and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), which are abundantly expressed in atherosclerotic tissues and regulate cell cycle and apoptosis [66]. Deletion of the same region in the murine genome was associated with severe reduced expression of Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b mRNAs. In experimental atherosclerotic models, Cdkn2a-deficient mice have smaller lesions and loss of Cdkn2b is associated with advanced atherosclerotic lesions [67, 68]. Mtap-knockdown mice also have a significant increase in atherosclerotic lesions [67]. Another proposed underlying mechanism rests in a long noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL), which overlaps CDKN2B. Unlike CDKN1A and CDKN2B, ANRIL expression is highly associated with the 9p21 haplotype and decreased ANRIL is directly correlated with severity of common carotid artery stenosis [69]. In vitro studies have demonstrated that ANRIL regulates CDKN2B expression in cultured human fibroblasts. A significant limitation of the mouse atherosclerosis models to investigate the biological functions of Anril is the fact that mice lack a clear ortholog of ANRIL [70]. Non-human primates may be needed to illustrate the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease at the 9p21 locus. Recently, Harismendy and colleagues have identified 33 enhancers in 9p21 locus and two SNPs within the 9p21 locus which disrupt the binding for signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) to the enhancer that physically interacts with the CDKN2A/B locus and MTAP gene [73]. As STAT1 is a downstream inflammatory effector, these findings indicate that the 9p21 locus may play a role in inflammatory signaling in the arterial wall. Ongoing fundamentally translational research on the 9p21 locus will reveal the new underlying mechanisms and may drive development of novel therapeutic approaches for atherosclerosis.",

As an enzyme, ADAMTS-7 affects the extracellular matrix of vascular smooth muscle cells, but this locus has no relationship to traditional risk factors. Overexpression of ADAMTS7 induced vascular smooth muscle cells migration and promoted neointima formation following artery injury through the degradation of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in rats [73]. Kessler and colleagues demonstrated that Adamts7 inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and migration via degradation of thrombospondin-1 in Comp-independent manner [74]. Adamts7-deficient mice showed enhanced vessel re-endothelialization and reduced neointima formation after wire injury [74]. Bauer and colleagues addressed the effect of Adamts7 on atherosclerosis development. Deletion of Adamts7 significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion formation in mice on both Apoe knockout and Ldlr knockout background without significant changes in plasma lipid profiles [75]. Adamts7 deletion impaired VSMC migration and developed plaques with a larger fibrous cap, indicating targeting ADAMTS7 may result not only in decreased atherosclerosis but also in more stable plaques.",

            "text": "Over the last few decades, it is well accepted that inflammatory processes not only promote initiation of atherosclerosis, but also contribute to acute cardiovascular events, such as triggering MI. Network analysis demonstrates that some genes, such as APOA-I and Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), involved in lipid metabolism pathways also involved in inflammation, contributing to CAD pathogenesis [9]. Increased Interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression has been associated with CAD. IL-6 binds to its receptor and plays a central role in propagating the downstream inflammatory response during atherosclerosis progression. A non-synonymous IL-6R variant is associated with increased circulating levels of IL-6 and decreased CAD risk [76, 77], suggesting a causal relationship between IL-6R-related pro-inflammatory pathways and CAD. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks both membrane-bound and circulating IL6R, has anti-inflammatory actions and is licensed for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with an IL-6R monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab, show increased circulating triglycerides and LDL-C levels [78], suggesting that blockage of IL-6R pathway to protect against atherosclerosis need to be reconsidered. The chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, play an important protective role in atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of CXCL12 are decreased in CAD patients compared with healthy control subjects [79]. Rs1746048, at chromosome 10q11 near the CXCL12 gene, is associated with CAD and plasma levels of CXCL12 [80]. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is critical for retention and release of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow and Cxcr4 deficient mice showed increased atherosclerotic lesions due to hyperactivation of circulating neutrophils [81, 82]. Other GWAS-identified signal for CAD includes ABO locus on chromosome 9q34 and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus on chromosome 6p21.3 [71, 83, 84]. Further studies are required to confirm the association and to identify the causative allele.",

            "text": "The NO-sGC-cGMP pathway is a major pathway controlling vascular smooth-muscle relaxation, vascular tone, and vascular remodeling. Under normal conditions, NO binds to soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and activates sGC to generate cGMP, and thus stimulates cGMP-dependent protein kinase I, which inhibits VSMC constriction, proliferation and migration, and reduces platelet adhesion and activation as well as vascular inflammation [85]. Lu et al. performed a two-stage GWAS of CAD in a sample including 33,000 Han Chinese individuals, and identified that rs1842896 at 4q32.1 is associated with CAD [86]. GUCY1A3, encoding \u03b11-sGC, is the only gene in this CAD-associated locus. Erdmann et al. reported the segregation of two private, heterozygous mutations in GUCY1A3 and CCT7, in an extended myocardial infarction family [87]. CCT7 encodes CCT\u03b7, a member of the tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex, which stabilizes \u03b11-sGC. In vitro studies demonstrated that mutations in both GUCY1A3 and CCT7 severely reduce \u03b11-sGC as well as \u03b21-sGC protein content, and impaired \u03b11-sGC activity. Moreover, platelets from mutation carriers contained less \u03b11-sGC protein and consequently displayed reduced nitric-oxide-induced cGMP formation. Mice deficient in \u03b11-sGC protein displayed accelerated thrombus formation in the microcirculation after local trauma [87]. These genetic and functional studies identified a link between impaired \u03b11-sGC-dependent NO signaling and MI risk, possibly through accelerated thrombus formation. Studies are ongoing to reveal the role of Gucy1a3 in atherosclerosis as well as lipid metabolism.",

The most widely used in vivo model for atherosclerosis study is currently the mouse with Ldlr knockout or Apoe knockouts at the forefront. However, most of the GWAS identified susceptibility variants are found within noncoding regions, making it difficult to define disease associations with specific transcripts. In addition, the regulatory variants may not be evolutionarily conserved, for example, the mouse\u2019s lack of Cetp and a clear ortholog of ANRIL in the 9p21 region. Some large animal models, such as pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman primates, have particular advantages for certain types of studies because they have shown an atherosclerotic pattern comparable to that of humans [88].
