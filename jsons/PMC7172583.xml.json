These transmissions could be patient-to-patient, visitor-to-patient, patient-to-health care worker and health care worker-to-patient.",

Critically ill neonates, infants and children are cared for separately within the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) (Bennett and Bion, 1999). A number of factors have been associated with increased risk of infection transmission among hospitalized patients. These include the increased number of airborne particles generated by activities such as suction, nebulization and cleaning especially at times when patient admissions are highest and when seasonal viruses are at their peak (Eidelman et al., 2009, Leung et al., 2014, World Health Organization Guideline, 2014). Parents, guardians, visitors and hospital staff who are shedding viruses also increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection and contribute to increased particle concentration (Voirin et al., 2009). The quality of the air supply within the PICU environment is also important, as airborne pollutant exposure may affect the health of staff and patients. Currently, only one study has been conducted to investigate indoor bioaerosol characteristics in the PICU (Li and Hou, 2003).",

A nurses' station was located in the centre of the PICU. A mechanical air-handling unit (AHU) with two-stage filtration provided a constant flow of supply air to the PICU. The first stage filters (dry media filters) functioned in the same way as those in a typical mechanical ventilation system, with a filtration efficiency of 45\u201365%, while the second stage filters were high efficiency particulate air filters (HEPA) (Econocell Filters, Australia). There were four return air outlets, which were located above Beds 5 and 6, between Beds 5 and 6, and in the visiting room. In general, the first and second stage (HEPA) filters of the ventilation system were changed after approximately 1\u20132 years and 2\u20133 years, respectively.",

Normal saline or 0.9% sodium chloride is not mandatory, but is the preferred solution for bacterial manipulations as it is an isotonic solution and therefore the osmotic pressure of the bacterial cells is maintained. Saline is also a suitable medium to retain viral integrity prior to nucleic acid extraction for PCR. Due to the high flow rate used for sampling, it was possible that some of the liquid became aerosolized during sample collection. To contain these particles and prevent them from being released into the indoor air of the PICU, the instrument was placed in a plastic bag, with a HEPA filter at its outlet to remove any particles generated by the Coriolis \u03bc Air Sampler.",

Daily 24 h average indoor and outdoor PM10 and PN0.005\u20133 \u03bcm concentrations are presented in Fig. 2\n. Both the average indoor PM10 (0.6\u20132.2 \u03bcg m\u2212 3, median: 0.9 \u03bcg m\u2212 3) and PN0.005\u20133 \u03bcm (0.1\u20132.8 \u00d7 103\n p cm\u2212 3, median: 0.67 \u00d7 103\n p cm\u2212 3) concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the outdoor concentrations (6.7\u201310.2 \u03bcg m\u2212 3, median: 8.0 \u03bcg m\u2212 3 for PM10 and 12.1\u201322.2 \u00d7 103\n p cm\u2212 3, median: 16.4 \u00d7 103\n p cm\u2212 3 for PN0.005\u20133 \u03bcm). The daily 24 h average outdoor PM10 concentrations measured at the hospital were comparable with those at the nearby monitoring station during the measurement period (Fig. S2).

Therefore, the 24 h indoor concentrations were only about 11% and 4% of the 24 h outdoor PM10 and PN0.005\u20133 \u03bcm concentrations, respectively.

This implies that indoor concentrations were mainly affected by indoor sources, and to a lesser extent by outdoor air. An example of the diurnal variation of indoor and outdoor concentrations is given in Fig. 3\n, which shows that both indoor PM10 and PN0.005\u20133 \u03bcm concentrations increased due to nebulization therapy, cleaning activities and operation of other indoor sources.

In addition, it was seen that invasive tracheal suctioning performed by nurses or medical staff might have been another important indoor particle source. It was not possible to link all the peaks in particle concentrations with the sources generating them, due to the lack of activity records, particularly during the night, or because they were simply not recognized or recorded. Fig. 6\nshows an example of a time series of indoor and outdoor PN0.005\u20133 \u03bcm and indoor PN0.5\u201320 \u03bcm concentrations, as well as indoor and outdoor PN0.005\u20133 \u03bcm and PM10 concentrations in the PICU. From this figure, the effect of indoor sources on indoor particle concentrations can be seen, and in particular that there were many peaks in both supermicrometer and submicrometer particle concentrations, which suggests that there were different types of indoor particle sources. Some sources generated only supermicrometer particles (such as dusting, changing bed sheets, coughing), others generated only submicrometer particles (such as mopping the floor with detergent), while some produced both types of particles (such as nebulization therapy).

The study showed that the average supply air PN0.1\u20135 \u03bcm concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 1.85 p cm\u2212 3 (median of 0.45 p cm\u2212 3) and room air PN0.1\u20135 \u03bcm concentrations, from 0.50 to 4.67 p cm\u2212 3 (median of 2.0 p cm\u2212 3). This implies that the average indoor PN0.1\u20135 \u03bcm concentrations were about 3.4 times higher than those of supply air in that PICU. In our study the average indoor PN concentrations were about 17 times higher than those in supply air. However, it should be noted that it is difficult to compare the results from the two studies because of the different instruments used and the particle size range measured in the two studies.",

While nebulization of drugs is required to treat patients, due to the large production and efficient movement of particles within the PICU, it is prudent to consider whether it could lead to unintended exposures to these particles among other patients and staff. Similarly, other patients and staff in the PICU may also be unnecessarily exposed to particles generated from the nebulized drug solution. Furthermore, particles generated from patients' breathing could also be considered a risk to other patients and staff in the PICU, as they may contain harmful bacterial and viral pathogens. However, the potential risk of nebulization may be reduced within this PICU as no rhinoviruses were detected in any of the samples tested during this study, despite being considered common viruses even among those without symptoms.",

The average indoor PN and PM10 concentrations in the PICU were substantially lower than outdoors. The contribution of outdoor particles to indoor particle concentrations was very low for both PN and PM10. This result could be due to the two-stage filters (primary filter: fabric bag; secondary filter: HEPA filter) which achieve 99.99% filtration efficiency. However, regular maintenance of the ventilation system is needed to ensure the HEPA filters are in good working order.",

The main indoor sources for particle generation identified in the PICU were nebulization therapy, tracheal suction and cleaning activities. There were also some particle sources that were not identified, due to a lack of recorded activity information. Based on multipoint measurement data, the spatial variation of particle concentration in the PICU was low because of rapid transport of particles generated across the whole area of the PICU. Surprisingly, particles generated in the isolated single room (Bed 2) were also transported to other open areas or other beds. Despite the transport of particles from the isolation room to other areas of PICU, this study showed lower bioaerosol concentrations compared with the previous research in PICU environments. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that the likelihood of bioaerosols being transported from the isolation room to other areas of the PICU is small; however, it is still an infection control risk, especially in the absence of viruses being detected in airborne particles in our study.",
