The COVID-19 pandemic exerts a major and universal impact on the human population. Although the case fatality rates of previous coronaviruses middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV (35% and 11%) were considerably higher than with SARS-CoV\u20112 (around 2%), SARS-CoV\u20112 has been transmitted much more rapidly and could not be confined to certain regions resulting in a quickly evolving pandemic [1]. As of 6 April 2020, 1,309,439 people worldwide have been tested positive for SARS-CoV\u20112 and 72,638 died from COVID-19 [2]. On the same day, 12,206 persons were tested positive and 220 fatalities were noted in Austria [3]. Moreover, 1074 COVID patients were hospitalized, 250 in intensive care units [4] with most being invasively ventilated.",

Notably, diabetes patients presented with higher inflammatory serum markers including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), c-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D\u2011dimer, lower lymphocyte counts, and more pronounced computer tomography (CT) imaging pathologies indicating more severe overall and particularly lung involvement [16]. The D\u2011dimer levels, which are strongly linked to a higher mortality in COVID-19 [24], are significantly higher in patients with diabetes indicating a disposition to a hypercoagulable state [16].",

In this report 22.2% of intensive care unit patients had diabetes compared to 10.1% in the overall hospitalized COVID-19 population. Hence, diabetes confers a similar increase as noted for other risk populations such as those with hypertension, or cardiovascular disease [20]. A comprehensive report on 1099 patients in China showed a prevalence of diabetes of 7.4% in the overall COVID-19 population; however, 16.2% in those with severe disease [17]. Moreover, 26.2% of patients experiencing the primary composite end point, i.e. admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation or death had diabetes, a roughly 3.6-fold enrichment in the critically affected patients. A recent meta-analysis calculated an odds ratio of 2.2 for diabetes patients to be admitted to an intensive care unit [13]. Accordingly, diabetes was significantly associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a hazard ratio of 2.3 [25]. In summary, the pooled ratio of diabetes among COVID-19 patients with a more severe course compared to those with the more favorable course was 2.26 indicating a significantly elevated risk [23].",

These data mirror the higher mortality rates of diabetes patients in SARS and MERS [26]. Moreover, presence of diabetic complications potentiates diabetes-related mortality [16]. Of note, plasma glucose levels and diabetes were independent predictors for mortality and morbidity in patients with SARS [16] but are not yet evaluated in the current COVID-19 season. In conclusion, diabetes not so much increases the risk of SARS-CoV\u20112 infection, but significantly enhances COVID-19 severity and mortality.",

Target glucose depends on several patient factors, particularly comorbidities, but generally lies between 140 and 180 mg/dl preprandially for those with severe signs of COVID-19.

Depending on the duration of these measures this may leave a huge proportion of diabetes patients in an insecure state, with the inability to get a routine check and no option to intensify a potentially insufficient therapy. Insufficient glucose control has the potential to provoke numerous acute and chronic complications healthcare systems will have to deal with after the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine could be a reasonable approach to at least partly mitigate the problem of uncontrolled diabetes. The more widespread use of flash glucose monitoring (FGM) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) enables the physician to get insights into complete daily glucose profiles with minimum time investment from the patient. This approach is especially suitable for experienced type 1 diabetes patients since their insulin dose might be easily adjustable without the need for face to face contact. In type 2 diabetes, however, this option is of limited use as FGM and CGM are not commonly used in this population yet; however, meta-analyses have found that benefits of telemedicine in type 1 and type 2 diabetes are modest and do not affect clinically relevant end points [46\u201348]; however, telemedicine with improved instruments could complement personal contact in standard diabetes management.
