Throat swabs were collected from all these patients and sent to the laboratory of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention for tests of SARS-CoV-2 using the standard kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China). Diagnosis criteria of COVID-19 infection include 1) typical chest CT imaging of patchy shadowing and ground-glass opacity, and 2) positive in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies argued that false negative cases might be common for COVID-19 infection cases due to low virus titers, sampling at late stage of illness, and inappropriate swabbing sites [8] .",

Although this is the largest number of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in literature so far, the sample size is still relatively small.
