We report the detection method of 14 cases with confirmed COVID\u201019 infection admitted to hospitals in Jinhua, aiming to investigate the other possible transmission route of this virus.",

Stool specimen collection will reduce medical staff infections compared to oropharyngeal swabs specimens, especially when protective equipment in China is inadequate. We are not sure if there is a fecal\u2010oral transmission, but fomite transmission might have contributed considerably to the rapid spread of COVID\u201019. Finally, this report highlights the need for health protection, which should be considered for transmission through stool, these discoveries will curb the rapid spread of COVID\u201019 worldwide.",
