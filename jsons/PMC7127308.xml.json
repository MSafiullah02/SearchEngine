            "text": "Cities are important CO2 source (Liu et al., 2011) and core areas of CO2 emissions reduction in China (Wu et al., 2017b, Zhu et al., 2017). Urbanization increases energy consumption and becomes one of the main contributors to CO2 emissions. China has become the country with the highest CO2 emissions since 2006 (Gregg et al., 2008). Urbanization level in China increased rapidly from 35.87% in 2000 to 55.61% in 2015. It has exceeded the world average since 2013 (World Bank, 2017). Rapid urbanization has led to a shortage of resources and worsened environmental pollution (Yang et al., 2014). In order to solve environmental problems, accelerating environmental protection and the construction of ecological civilization (e.g., reducing carbon emission) has been put forward since the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (Yang et al., 2013). China's new urbanization plan (2014\u20132020) calls for the promotion of low carbon development as well as the adoption of low-carbon lifestyles and urban construction modes (Bai et al., 2014). Chinese central government proposed to implement low-carbon urbanization, which attracted the attention of local governments and research scholars (Liu and Qin, 2016, Mittal et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2015).",

Charnes and Cooper (1985) combined the DEA with window analysis and proposed the DEA window analysis to estimate the dynamic effect of data. The fuzzy DEA model was proposed by Ignatius et al. (2016) to evaluate CEE in 23 European Union (EU) countries. Slack-based measure (SBM) DEA model was applied by Choi et al. (2012) to calculate the efficiency and potential CO2 emissions reduction (PCR) (the slack of CO2 emissions) in China. The average PCR was 56.1 million tons in each province, and the CEE in eastern China is better than that in other regions in China.",

Due to the spatial variations in economic development and the source of carbon emissions inside the country or province, there is obvious spatial difference in CEE across its prefecture-level cities inside the country or province. And therefore, prefecture-level city data can provide more detailed information and make more accurate estimation, whereas national or provincial CEE analyses may have bias, at least due to the lack of spatial details. Meanwhile, many studies ignored the influence of spatial effect (Li et al., 2017). They assumed that study units were independent, but each spatial unit can actually affect its neighbors by technical diffusion and industrial transfer. For instance, Zhou et al. (2017) applied a two-stage DEA model to evaluate energy efficiency in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries from 1995 to 2013. The study found that the energy efficiency of developed countries was usually higher than those of developing countries. Liu et al. (2016a) utilized the SBM model to analyze CEE of Chinese provinces and found that the CEE of most Chinese provinces showed a downward trend from 2000 to 2011.",

Second, previous studies on the factors that influence CEE mainly focus on market-oriented reforms (Lin and Du, 2015), environmental regulations (Zhao et al., 2015), technology and management factor (Cui and Li, 2015, Qin et al., 2017), while few of them focus on urbanization. Third, most studies ignored the effect of spatial spillover on CEE and assumed that adjacent regions were independent. However, ignoring spatial spillover can exacerbate the biases of the results.",

Urbanization has increased moderately, while CO2 emission has grown rapidly since 2000 in the YRD (Song et al., 2015, Tian et al., 2011). Thus, we investigated the effect of urbanization on CEE since 2000. Due to data availability, the study covered the period of 2000\u20132010. Different from most previous studies, this study takes the prefecture-level city as the basic study unit. Then, we analyze the relationship between urbanization and CEE. Finally, to take into account spatial spillover effect, a spatial lag panel Tobit model is constructed to analyze the impact of urbanization on CEE. The results are helpful for evaluating the carbon reduction task in the YRD, guiding policymakers to establish a plan to improve CEE, and providing a scientific basis for the development of low carbon urbanization.",

            "text": "CEE was taken as the dependent variable for building the econometric model. Since CEE values change between 0 and 1, the Tobit model is used (McDonald and Moffitt, 1980). The Tobit model has been widely used to investigate the influencing factors of environmental efficiency (Feng et al., 2017a, Lv et al., 2015, Yuan et al., 2013). The spatial spillover effect of CEE is the impact of some prefecture-level cities on their neighboring prefecture-level cities. The influences mainly derive from the demonstration effect in higher CEE prefecture-level cities through low-carbon technology diffusion and industrial transfer. Thus, a spatial lag model was constructed to take into account the spatial spillover effects of CEE. Meanwhile, this study explored whether there was environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for CEE and urbanization. Based on the above considerations, the model is as follows (Anselin, 1988, Feng et al., 2017a, Yuan et al., 2013):(8)Yit=\u03b1+\u03c1WYit+\u03b11URit+\u03b12URit+\u03b2iXit+\u03b5itwhere Y is the CEE; i and t represent the ith prefecture-level city and tth year, respectively; \u03b1 is the constant term; \u03c1 is the spatial autoregressive coefficient; W\nij is the spatial weight matrix (here we choose queen contiguity weight matrix due to prefecture-level cities with one common edge or corner (Anselin, 1988)); \u03b1\n1 is the coefficient of urbanization level; \u03b1\n2 is the coefficient of squared-term urbanization level; \u03b2\ni denotes the coefficient of control variables; X\nit stands for the control variables; and \u03b5\nit represents the error term.",

People may need more infrastructure at a low urbanization level, which may increase carbon emissions and decrease CEE (Zi et al., 2016). However, when urbanization reaches a certain level, resource management and economies of scale may become better, and urbanization may become conducive to improving CEE (Mart\u00ednez-Zarzoso et al., 2007, York, 2007). Furthermore, since GDP per capita (GDPP) is an important influence on energy consumption and CO2 emissions (Li et al., 2017), GDPP is also found to be closely related to CEE (Yuan et al., 2013). In addition, CEE may be affected by industrial structure and population density (Feng et al., 2017a, Yuan et al., 2013). Secondary industry is the main source of CO2 emissions, and it is more difficult to improve the CEE of secondary industry (Hao et al., 2015). There is an uncertain relationship between population density and CEE. Liu et al. (2016b) suggested that higher population density may urge the government and population to pay more attention to the environment, and it may improve CEE. However, Cropper and Griffiths (1994) thought that higher population density may lead to higher pressure on the environment, which can in turn lead to a decrease in CEE.",

CEE showed an obvious decreasing trend in 2004. This may be due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which seriously influenced the economy in the YRD in 2003 and continued into 2004 (Zhong et al., 2003). CEE exhibited a distinctly increasing trend from 2005 to 2010. This is because of the implementation of sustainable development policies which paid more attention to energy conservation, pollutant reduction and green development (Li and Lin, 2016). In 2009, the Chinese government set a target to reduce carbon intensity to 40\u201345% of the 2005 level by 2020 (Qiu, 2009), and each prefecture-level government put more emphasis on reducing carbon emission. Meanwhile, the global financial crisis of 2008 seriously impacts China's economy. The central government accelerated the economic adjustment in the post-financial crisis period after 2008 (Li et al., 2016) and thus CEE significantly increased after 2009. CEE increased from 2005 to 2010, which does not mean that CO2 emission decreased from 2005 to 2010. The reason is that GDP increased during this period and GDP growth was usually accompanied by the increase in total CO2 emission. The Pearson correlation analysis indicates an insignificant negative relationship between CEE and urbanization (Table 3). When spatial factors were considered, bivariate Moran's I value is significant and negative during the period 2004\u20132010, indicating that there is a significant negative relationship between CEE in one prefecture-level city and their neighbors' urbanization.",

In terms of the Low-High type of prefecture-level cities with low CEE, their nearby cities with high urbanization are more competitive compared to these cities with low CEE. Without sufficient capital and technology, it is difficult for cities with low CEE to further improve their CEE (Choi et al., 2012, Qin et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2016b). The High-Low type prefecture-level cities own advanced low-carbon technology and attract more high-quality resources from their neighboring cities with low urbanization level. Thus, these cities had high carbon emissions efficiency. For the prefecture-level cities of the High-High type, their nearby cities have a better radiation effect to these cities, and they can attract advanced low-carbon technology to improve their CEE. The PCR showed variation from 0 ton to 75.30 million tons in 2010 (Table A2). According to the PCR, different CO2 emission reduction tasks should be allocated to prefecture-level cities. Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are the two prefecture-level cities with the largest PCR because their leading industries are still heavy industries that consume more energy and produce more carbon emissions. Thus, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are the key location for reducing CO2 emissions. More CO2 emission reduction tasks should be allocated to these two cities. In the future, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou should promote the adjustment of their industrial structure and technological innovation. Meanwhile, measures are needed to introduce advanced low-carbon technologies and strengthen interregional cooperation (Zhang et al., 2016a).",

In the future, local governments should pay close attention to developing a low-carbon economy, as well as upgrading economic structure and growth manner (Li and Lin, 2016). The correlation coefficient between industrial structure and CEE is negative but not significant, similar to the result of Bian et al. (2016). Secondary industries are relatively inefficient than tertiary industries (Bian et al., 2016). When the proportion of secondary industries is higher, it is more difficult to improve CEE (Hao et al., 2015). Some effective measures have been adopted to adjust and optimize industrial structure, and the proportion of secondary industry has decreased in some cities (Liu and Li, 2015). In the future, local governments should put more emphasis on the transformation and upgrading of industrial structure. Meanwhile, byproducts should be reused more and industrial cooperation needs further improvement.",
