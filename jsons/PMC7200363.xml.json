            "text": "The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in China in December 2019, and by March 2020 had spread across the globe. While the development of a vaccine continues, public health strategies to contain the spread of the disease have been put in place in nearly every country (World Health Organization, 2020). These include quarantine (self-isolation) of people potentially exposed to the virus, and social distancing (more accurately termed \u2018physical distancing\u2019) of the general population (World Health Organization, 2020). While physical distancing may be the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus (Center for Disease Control et al., 2003), this measure may be associated with a range of adverse psychological effects, including fear, anxiety, and worry (Brooks et al., 2020; Gardner and Moallef, 2015), in addition to the physical effects of decreased motor activity, changes to diet, and exposure to sunlight (Lippi et al., 2020). Such impacts are likely to differ across pandemics and populations, for example, Wang et al. (2011) reported no immediate negative psychological effect of quarantine in their sample of University students in China during the H1N1 flu outbreak. The incidence of depression and anxiety in populations where physical distancing is enforced may be impacted (Brooks et al., 2020) and there has been media speculation around this issue, with some Governments actively recognising and funding mental health services to respond to this potential surge in mental ill-health (Zhou et al., 2020). The implications for wellbeing are likely to be complex, however. Potential positives arising from the situation have also been speculated on, for example, a renewed sense of shared social purpose (Fransen et al., 2015), such as, \u2018everyone is in this together\u2019, and \u2018we must all act to protect the vulnerable and the healthcare system\u2019. There may also be short term benefits for individuals who experience social anxiety, with the expectation to stay at home, reducing typical stresses they experience from having to attend school or work, for example.",

For one, the association between influenza infection and psychosis has been reported since the Spanish Flu pandemic in the eighteenth century and subsequent acute \u201cpsychoses of influenza\u201d have been documented during multiple pandemics (K\u0119pi\u0144ska et al., 2020). A further point is that this population may be particularly at risk from the stress associated with physical distancing measures. While the use of mobile phones and technology continues to increase for people with psychosis, rates are still lower than in the general population (Firth et al., 2015). This may mean that physical distancing and reduction in social connectedness has a substantial effect on this group of individuals as they do not compensate as much with other methods of communication.",

For example, social isolation, unemployment, homelessness, relationship breakdown (divorce/separation), domestic violence, and worsening physical health, may all particularly effect people with psychosis given their vulnerability to social determinants of health (Anglin et al., 2020). Again, the direction of this impact is not known as there is the potential for pandemics to strengthen social inequities and thus impact associated risk factors. There is also the potential for an increase in the number of people with psychosis who suicide or attempt suicide, with some evidence of an increase in the number of suicides occurring after previous pandemics (Chan et al., 2006). What may complicate the interaction between psychosis and COVID-19 further is that the treatment of COVID-19 may involve the use of high doses of steroids to modulate the inflammatory response (Russell et al., 2020); steroids have been known to trigger psychotic symptoms (Wada et al., 2001).",

The World Health Organization (Tricco et al., 2017) advocates that rapid reviews are essential in providing informative summaries of these issues in such circumstances. We, therefore, aimed to undertake a rapid review of research on the impact of epidemics and pandemics on people with psychosis and the mental health services they use. Our review aimed to address the following questions related to living in a community exposed to an epidemic or pandemic:1.Is there a change in the incident cases of psychosis/being identified as ultra-high-risk (Yung et al., 2004) of psychosis?2.Are changes reported in the form and content of psychotic symptoms (i.e., do people incorporate beliefs about the virus into their symptoms)?3.Is there a change in demand for inpatient and community-based crisis services by people with psychosis?4.Is there a deterioration in the physical health of people with psychosis?5.Does the number of people with psychosis suiciding or attempting suicide change?6.Is there an increase in the number of people with psychosis who experience social issues such as homelessness, unemployment, domestic violence, and loneliness?7.How do people with psychosis experience the preventative measures put in place in pandemics (e.g. social distancing, increased handwashing)?\n",

Hu reported a 25% increase - compared to previous years - in incident cases of schizophrenia in January 2020, which the authors attributed to the psychosocial stress and physical distancing measures associated with the COVID-19 outbreak (Hu et al., 2020). The authors extracted data from 13,783 outpatients (of which 1210 presented for the first time) attending the Xuzhou Oriental People's (psychiatric) hospital in January 2020, the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors adjusted for a limited number of potential covariates - age, gender and place of residence - in their analysis. The absolute number of new cases of schizophrenia is comparatively small and may be explained by simple random variation. No data are reported in terms of the difference in presentation - other than that patients were seemingly older, with median age increased from 39 to 50. At the time of writing, these data were published on a Chinese open science platform, rather than a peer-reviewed journal. Additionally, of concern is the use of the diagnosis \u2018schizophrenia\u2019 when typically symptoms are required to be present for six months before this diagnosis to be reached.",

The authors report no details about the treatment and response. Lee et al.

An incident rate of 0.9% (n = 15) was reported in the 1744 SARS patients reviewed for the study. They subsequently matched these to 30 control patients who had SARS but did not experience psychosis. All participants in the study were treated with steroids. Patients in the psychosis group received significantly higher doses of steroids while inpatient than controls (median dose in hydrocortisone equivalent, 10,975 mg v. 6780 mg).

In some countries, such practices may be considered unethical and potentially incompatible with mental health laws. Helping people with psychosis maintain physical distancing and infection control requirements may be challenging, particularly while they are inpatients. For clinicians working in mental health services where personal protective equipment (PPE) may be limited, this may cause concern in the longer term. Tailored patient education about the importance of complying with infection control measures was recommended by Pang et al. (2004). In the absence of any high-quality evidence about how to ensure compliance with infection control behaviours, clinicians may need to consider applying other psychoeducation techniques (Xia et al., 2011), particularly for individuals with prominent disorganisation symptoms.",

Only three databases were searched. We did not search key databases such as CINAHL that indexes research not covered by the databases we used. The decision to restrict the databases we searched was based on our experience of the likely relevance of studies indexed in CINAHL (primarily focused on nursing) and other candidate databases. That said, there may be relevant studies that we omitted as a consequence. Finally, data extraction was undertaken by a single researcher; although this was done carefully, there is a possibility that errors may have occurred.

There was limited evidence to suggest that patients that developed psychosis responded well to low dose antipsychotics such as aripiprazole. In addition to steroid-induced psychosis, there was some limited and poor-quality evidence which suggested that extreme psychosocial stress-triggered incident cases in people previously unaffected. Of importance to current mental health service provision, patients with existing psychosis may be less likely to comply with physical distancing and personal hygiene requirements required during an outbreak of an infectious disease, representing a potential risk to the community and mental health clinicians.
