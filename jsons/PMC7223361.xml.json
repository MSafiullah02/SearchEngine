It emphasizes the importance of integrating animal welfare into veterinary medicine and discusses four main challenges to the veterinary profession in the 2020s. Briefly, veterinarians, as trusted medical experts, are increasingly being called on by the public and policy makers to also be scientific and moral authorities in animal welfare. They are: (1) expected to go beyond traditional conceptions of health by adopting a holistic view that also considers animal welfare, not only disease treatment; (2) challenged to reimagine their professional duties when it comes to disease prevention at the intersection of animal-human-ecosystem health; (3) increasingly forced to develop core competencies in animal welfare in order to provide professional leadership in animal welfare and navigate discourses concerning competing professional priorities and socio-political ideologies and; (4) asked to provide feedback on novel networked devices, monitoring technologies and automated animal welfare solutions, thus, requiring familiarity with cutting-edge engineering and technological developments in order to critically assess their application to animals\u2019 welfare.

Also, in the 2020\u2019s veterinarians will need to utilize their voice more as issues involving the moral status and welfare of animals become political and they are asked to provide informed leadership to society on responsible use and care of animals. In doing so, veterinarians will have to develop greater sensitivity to and knowledge of a broad range of scientific and ethical issues in veterinary practice. The article concludes by offering next-step suggestions about how veterinarians, as trusted medical and moral authorities on animal welfare science and ethics, can lead and participate in professional activities that result in better animal health and welfare outcomes. Here, four pillars are suggested to help guide veterinarians and the veterinary profession in tackling these challenges. They are: Collaboration, Critical Engagement, Centeredness on Research, and Continuous Self-Critique. ",

            "text": "Veterinarians tend to focus on treating diseases in their patients as their primary clinical responsibility. This focus is due in large part to a narrow conception of what matters to animals, namely, their health. Here, classic veterinary textbooks steer practitioners and students alike towards a commonly defined view of animal health that privileges biological functioning, homeostasis, productivity, and successful reproduction. However, this classical view is steadily being upended by current scientific evidence provided by animal welfare science that emphasizes the complexity of animals\u2019 experiences and features of their environment [1,2,3]; both of which have relevance to clinical assessments of what matters to animals, at every step of clinical case management. The classical approach has also to contend with the values or ethical and scientific dimensions of what is in animals\u2019 preferences [4]. Thus, taken together, a turn towards a broader conception of health to include the welfare of the animal [5,6]\u2014one which is constituted by both animal welfare science and normative components [2,7]\u2014is strongly recommended for contemporary veterinary medicine.

Per their professional charge, veterinarians should be open to medical training and development of core competencies that embrace the more holistic conception of animal health [8] that includes animal welfare and truly gets to the best interests of their patients, clients and the various publics they serve. That is, they should be willing to contextualize health deficits within a larger and comprehensive understanding of public expectations about animals\u2019 welfare. ",

[11] defines animal health holistically as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental, and spiritual well-being\u201d [12]. These definitions of animal health are consonant with the one used by the World Health Organization (WHO), which declared that \u201chealth is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u201d (https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/constitution). Noteworthy is that this more holistic definition of animal health has been employed by animal welfare scientists for a number of decades now, such as Broom [1], Fraser et al. [2], and Duncan [3], who see this expanded conception of health to be synonymous with \u201cwell-being\u201d and \u201canimal welfare.\u201d These animal welfare scientists had clearly understood early on that considerations of animals\u2019 welfare went beyond biological function, as commonly understood by traditional clinicians. Thus, veterinarians would benefit society enormously by broadening their view of animal health.",

Assessing these priorities involves making ethical decisions about what it is in the animal\u2019s interest, which include being able to balance benefits and harms, evaluating the trade-offs among distinct scientific welfare indicators and judiciously reasoning through conflicting empirical claims. Animal welfare science can be characterized as the rigorous use of scientific methods to study the quality of life of animals, including that of companion animals, research animals, wildlife, and those farmed for food. This relatively new science (which has its inception in the 1960s) is borne out of ethical concern for animals [2,13] and can inform the choice of practices involving animals. Its focus is on investigating animal-based measures, including animals\u2019 perspectives and preferences in a specific context. Animal welfare science develops and integrates behavioral, physiological, psychological, clinical and epidemiological measures and indicators of welfare to identify whether a specific context is either positive or negative for animals at individual or group levels [4,14]. Science-based interventions that promote animals\u2019 positive affective states and expression of species-specific behaviors can inform interventions to prevent and treat diseases and vice-versa. In animal agriculture, for example, these interventions contribute to housing, handling, husbandry and management practices that can lead to good financial outcomes for producers, healthier and safer food for consumers and greater environmental sustainability.",

Veterinarians are increasingly being drawn into animal health and welfare issues that require them to demonstrate awareness of and professional leadership on multidisciplinary subjects at the intersection of human-animal-ecosystem health. In 2006, the American Medical Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) approved resolutions supporting the One Health initiative. A main driver of the 2006 One Health initiative was the increasing prevalence of serious disease outbreaks amongst both humans and animals around the world (see for example, https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/index.html and https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06536#Fig1). The initiative \u201crecognizes that human health (including mental health via the human-animal bond phenomenon), animal health, and ecosystem health are inextricably linked. One Health seeks to promote, improve and defend the health (and therefore well-being) of all species, by enhancing cooperation and collaboration between physicians, veterinarians, other scientific health and environmental professionals and by promoting strengths in leadership and management to achieve these goals\u201d (http://www.onehealthinitiative.com/mission.php). The resolution marks the first time a holistic definition was formally agreed upon to address the interconnections between human-animal-ecosystem health, and it resulted in greater public visibility for the well-being of animals [18]. One Health considers the realities of the day, including the scaling up of agricultural production, housing billions of livestock in close and confined quarters, antimicrobial resistance, human encroachment into wilderness for development purposes, and exposure to new disease agents and vectors as human-animal interactions intensify.

When first announced, the initiative was at odds with how most veterinarians were trained. Originally led by two physicians and a veterinarian working on epidemiological issues, the One Health initiative has since expanded, moving past discourses around antimicrobial resistance in which it has predominantly been featured in the past years [19]. In classical epidemiology, the typical orientation is toward biology and mechanisms of causation and populations and their interactions with the environment [20]. ",

Contemporary veterinary epidemiology, on the other hand, invites veterinarians to integrate quantitative and qualitative animal welfare science research for different species as a core component in epidemiological research and modelling to ensure better health and welfare of animals and protection of humans and the environment. This calls for a new set of approaches from epidemiological research to population studies. In contrast to classical epidemiology, epidemiological approaches that view animal welfare more holistically, should emphasize promoting optimum welfare as the basis of disease prevention \u2013 that is, by considering standard measures of physical health together with animal behavior and affective states and the impact of the complex relationships animals have with conspecifics, humans, the environment and other species (e.g., there is growing speculation that wildlife trafficking and/or conventional farming techniques may have contributed to the emergence of SARS 2 Covid-19 virus).

The 1948 WHO definition of health states that it is \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d Here, health is also about promoting an orientation that emphasizes intervention strategies that provide both humans and animals with safe environments that are protected against possible threats to their welfare (or health), in order to maximize their welfare. Thus, in the context of providing good animal care or husbandry for domesticated animals, veterinarians along with caregivers and owners have an acquired responsibility to ensure that these animals have an environment that maximizes positive affective states [3] and that they are able to \u201ccope\u201d by expressing species-specific natural behaviors [1], while minimizing the risk of diseases. Factors in the environment and those intrinsic to the human or animal are particularly salient under this framework. In the case of the animal, the nature of the exposure to the environment, experiences of good health and positive affective states and opportunities to express natural behaviors, as per Fraser et al. [2] most likely influence the animal\u2019s clinical response to a certain agent, host or environment. In the clinical context, this entails that veterinarians should also consider how animals feel and behave as equally important to prevent diseases of epidemiological importance. ",

This is the case, especially when basic public health measures such as prevention, detection, monitoring and ending of outbreaks and epidemics through sanitation and epidemiological surveillance are not considered in our relationships with animals. Let us suppose that a group of people from a condo want to create a common area for pets to promote their welfare by designing welfare-friendly areas and promoting social encounters governed by welfare regulation, or that shopping malls want to welcome customers with pets by creating a common area for their pets and owners that meet welfare criteria but do not address public health issues. If not properly designed to meet animals\u2019 needs or preferences and surveilled for public and animal health concerns, these areas may have the potential to become sites of distress for animals and zoonotic transmission. At the time of writing, the world is hostage to a new world pandemic (SARS 2 Covid-19), a spillover transmission that, by all accounts, surfaced at a live animal market in Hubei province in central China. Here, the reservoir hosts most likely transferred the virus either via an animal host before zoonotic transfer or via humans following zoonotic transfer [21]. Spillover transmissions, that consist of \u201csuccessive processes that enable an animal pathogen to establish infection in a human,\u201d result from interactions among factors, such as disease dynamics in the reservoir host, pathogen exposure and within-human factors [22]. They could become more common as our interactions with animals become increasingly intertwined with our interests in strengthening the human-animal bond. Thus, further research is needed to map how human activities, animal care and husbandry practices, both directly and indirectly, may influence disease transmission.",

If not for animal welfare science and ethical concerns regarding the treatment of food animals motivating investigation, many livestock veterinarians today would probably still be recommending that dairy calves be housed individually to avoid disease transmission. Instead of housing calves individually, now we know, through controlled studies, that disease transmission can be prevented or mitigated through better colostrum management on farms. Furthermore, socially housed calves, when fed higher milk volumes via a teat and gradually weaned off milk to starter and forage, transition more smoothly to a solid diet, gain more weight and produce more milk [31,32,33]. These studies give veterinary epidemiologists a basis on which to perform future comparative studies aimed at improving dairy cattle husbandry and health. For example, in contrast to conventional practices that promote individual housing or restrict milk feeding, future studies could investigate the effects of feeding calves more milk or housing them in groups early on as a management strategy to minimize common husbandry issues. These studies may illuminate how diseases such as those that commonly occur during the transition period in dairy cows (3 weeks prior and 3 weeks after calving) can be minimized.",

The success of animal advocacy groups and activists promoting an animal-rights-based agenda into mainstream consciousness through many different media channels and persuasion modes poses significant ethical challenges [43,44,45,46]. Some examples of animal rights activism include vilifying producers, scientists and institutions that use animals, spreading misinformation about animal use practices and distorting conceptualizations of animals and animal welfare, extremist actions to eliminate (what activists consider) \u201cfactory farming,\u201d narrow conceptions of solidarity with sentient others [47], shaming consumers and producers of animal protein, and campaigning vociferously to \u201cde-animalize\u201d animal agriculture by creating \u201cclean\u201d or \u201csynthetic\u201d protein through biotechnological means, and thus, omitting the need for animals. While some animal activism has highlighted important shortcomings of animal production, such as overuse of antimicrobials and the pitfalls of resistance [27] and on-farm mistreatment of animals and welfare deficits, others have harmed opportunities to seek out answers that actually will improve the lives of animals. These include corrective measures for more humane systems through regulatory or structural reforms and collective or cooperative action that would incentivize behavioral change among major stakeholders who rely on animals. Animal activism that argues that no use of animals is ethically acceptable, ignores centuries of longstanding, complex and shared social, economic and ethical histories between humans and animals [48,49] that have resulted in good outcomes for animals [14].",

For example, the ban on horse slaughter in the United States in 2007 is a case in point. This ban stems from changes in state regulations and riders included in federal appropriations laws, prohibiting the use of federal funds for food safety inspections of horse slaughter facilities. The legislation also banned the transport of live horses from the United States to countries where they could be slaughtered for human consumption [57]. The horse slaughter case raises questions about whether the moral authority of veterinarians (e.g., members of the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP)) to amend the Horse Slaughter Act on animal welfare grounds resonates with the public and policy makers. While legislation has been introduced in the US Congress amending the Horse Protection Act and banning transport of horses to slaughter, this legislation has yet to be passed. As a consequence, thousands of horses continue to be neglected, have poor welfare and go hungry. Veterinarians who join discussions that emphasize animal rights over other deliberative frameworks (e.g., pragmatic ones) should be aware that these discussions may be framed by activism for animal causes that are absent of or misrepresent important scientific parameters that reflect animals\u2019 preferences (e.g., neglect to contextualize animal-based measures vis-\u00e0-vis a comprehensive understanding of animal welfare or overstate the extent to which the public or animal caretakers are motivated to change their habits due to animal welfare issues or economic interests) [14]. These discussions may also ignore the moral relevance of human-animal-environment relationships [58] or the substantial literature in animal welfare science (e.g., Applied Animal Behaviour Science, Animals, Animal Welfare, Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, Frontiers in Veterinary Science) that seek to improve the circumstances of animals within the context of improved technology, management practices, housing and animal care.",

Their concerns are categorized into issues of scope, alignment and vagueness of the concept. In terms of scope, while the concept \u201cis first and foremost a practical and programmatic call for interdisciplinary collaboration,\u201d the concept may be too much of a catchall to be effective for on-the-ground study of causal interconnections between interspecies and ecosystem function. In terms of alignment, the two metaphysical assumptions, i.e., of \u201charmony or synergy\u201d across different health systems (that there exists \u201can overall health state\u201d of an ecosystem), and the belief that both human and non-human entities (including environmental systems and constituents) have certain \u201cmoral status,\u201d which is action-guiding when it comes to the choice of interventions, is not uncontroversial. Where vagueness is concerned, veterinarians have an important role to play in shepherding discussions about the different meanings of One Health and in teasing out the metaphysical, analytical and ethical components of the concept for both policy development and practice (see also [66,75]).

For example, veterinarians will bring their clinical experiences and perspectives regarding animal health, biological functioning, affective states, distress and behavior and professional view of respect and care towards animal life to address topics such as prophylactic depopulation or emergency measures to protect uninfected animals and the livelihoods of farmers, or limiting antimicrobial usage to promote good outcomes for animals, the public health, future populations and the environment (fewer pollutants and less residue) [65,76,77]. Central to these deliberations will be an acumen to recognize and identify key ethical concerns around questionable practices and procedures in veterinary medicine. Frameworks like the One Health approach give veterinarians the opportunity to clarify their values and motivations and potentially support consensus building where there is conflict. It also allows veterinarians to work methodically through a series of questions including (adapted from [78]): What is the harm? Who are the stakeholders? How are the harms and benefits distributed? What information do we have? What information should we know before making the decision? What are the options? What ethical principles should guide us? Have the relevant stakeholders been invited to participate in decision-making or have their views represented? How should moral closure be established?",

How can the data be used and by whom, for what end? How transparent to society should the data obtained from animals be? How is farmer autonomy or identity dealt with? For companion animals, if they are designed with animal needs in mind, do the technologies offer the potential for caregivers to know more about the lives of their animals, especially when they are apart? To date, however, many technology developers still do not include veterinarians specializing in animal welfare or animal welfare specialists as part of a development team. Including these practitioners and welfare scientists are important since they may know how a device or piece of equipment could harm animals during prototyping and testing. Since animals cannot speak verbally, the special training possessed by these veterinarians and welfare scientists allow for needed interpretation of animals\u2019 preferences, behavior, health and affective states during prototype testing. Furthermore, a specialist in animal welfare science is also important in defining what scientific welfare parameters to consider when interpreting raw data gathered from monitoring systems (e.g., behavioral, psychological or pathological welfare indicators). Perhaps one way of protecting animals is to make veterinarians, working in tandem with IT developers and regulators, technically responsible for the animals in the development of processes and products. This would ensure that devices and data-systems are developed with animals\u2019 preferences in mind.",

These technologies will allow for real-time surveillance and monitoring and standardized measures of welfare, timely detection of poor welfare or illness in order to minimize treatment costs. Developers often extol the benefits of minimal human interaction with certain animals as a plus of these technologies. However, this displacement of manual attention and care already poses an ethical challenge for farmers [65,79], but at the same time may help animals in places where there are unqualified workers. Also, veterinarians would be required to have the requisite training to properly use or interface with the technology, interpret the continuous stream of data and apply it in a way that promotes animal welfare and positive human-animal relationships. Some knowledge in computer programming would benefit the veterinarian. Another concern involves making sure that these technologies do not take the place of good husbandry, animal care or conceal ways in which animals communicate their needs and preference to their caregivers [65,79,85]. From an ethical perspective, it is vital that such technologies do not relegate animals further to the status of undifferentiated commodities, unfamiliar to the caregivers as sentient beings with rich psychological experiences. Veterinarians have a role to play in offering guidance in the development of technologies that could otherwise diminish the benefits of ages of domestication of animals that have proven vital to the human-animal bond.

Here, multidisciplinary teams who marry animal welfare science, indicators and values can innovate certification programs, retailer practices, communication strategies, business benchmarking, information technology and so on, and bring greater transparency to the public so that they may grasp what is happening at the farm level, to make better informed decisions.

Moreover, many of the scientifically validated welfare applications available today, such as the Horse Grimace Scale and Welgoat Apps developed by the Animal Welfare Indicators Network, could be connected to online species-specific assessment protocols, e-government platforms, databanks, analytics, interactive media and be used by well-trained welfare assessors. Knowing what animals need or want and becoming familiar with their natures is essential to the sustainability and health of human-animal-ecological systems in agriculture. An ethical policy regarding technologies to adopt should focus on all aspects of the design and development process, not just the end products.

In Europe, welfare indicators and protocols have been developed to promote the sustainability of different animal systems. In the United States, the AVMA has been developing guidelines for euthanasia (since the 1990s, most recently updated in 2020 [87]), humane slaughter (first published in 2016), and depopulation (first published in 2019). The process of constructing guidelines has relied on multi-disciplinary teams, which includes veterinarians representing various species, animal welfare scientists and an ethicist, to determine the best possible techniques for humanely terminating animals under different conditions. In Canada, codes of practices (e.g., NFACC\u2014http://www.nfacc.ca/) have been developed within multidisciplinary settings, largely informed by the best available animal welfare science and reflective of social values.

The multifactorial nature of animal welfare lends itself to interesting cross-pollinations and growth for this area of study. For example, collaboration between veterinarians working on animal welfare issues and different branches of bioethics (e.g., animal and veterinary ethics, public health ethics, environmental and agricultural ethics, philosophy of technology) is also desirable to meet the human medical, public health, technological, and environmental challenges of the future. The veterinary profession has become increasingly specialized, with veterinarians focusing on their own subject matter. These challenges and how they intersect with the welfare of the different species (from both scientific and ethical standpoints) can facilitate much needed interdisciplinary connections beyond a focus on traditional clinical practice. They encourage veterinarians to broaden their understanding of the normative and scientific questions facing their profession, the political and moral dimensions of their work, both locally and globally, and the cultural dimensions involved in addressing collective action problems such as zoonoses and the role that welfare may have in preventing them. Veterinarians working in the areas of animal welfare can benefit from exploring the possibilities of using the normative and conceptual analyses from other disciplines, including ethics and political, social environmental and public health sciences [60,64]. For example, as noted by [74], \u201cwork in public health ethics on how to understand the conceptual relation between individual health and collective health, can be fruitful for animal and environmental ethics, where there is often a polarized debate between scholars about the moral status of animals\u201d (p. 2).

It also encourages a deeper commitment to problem identification from various perspectives, especially less dominant ones, so that all the relevant facts and a variety of alternatives can be shared and considered [95]. As major professional advocates for the interests of animals, veterinarians are essential to multidisciplinary teams tasked with addressing global concerns related to the health of human-animal-ecological systems. Their engagement in these teams is essential to facilitate resolving place-based dilemmas with competence, credibility and fairness.",

When marrying animal welfare science and ethics with technology, it is key that the information disseminated through these innovations is communicated efficiently to all stakeholders and considers the inclusion and integration of diverging interests, the rethinking of models that already exist, and the facilitation of participative learning and management platforms that incorporate science and values in order to better inform public policies, decision-making and sustainable practices. Continuous self-critique invites the opportunity for collective wading through competing principles that anchor the profession, e.g., non-malevolence, benevolence, and exposure to different systems of thought and discovery to ensure that broader social cum ethical concerns are appreciated and expectations are met. Greater empathy and respect and a deeper understanding of how humans-animals-environmental issues are connected to each other and valued may also emerge. In more concrete terms, tomorrow\u2019s veterinary students should be exposed to the scientific, political, ethical, and social dimensions of animal welfare, so that they can discern between animal advocacy groups that are genuinely committed to promoting animal welfare and more humane and respectful human-animal interactions through sound animal welfare science and groups that have alternative political agendas [96,97]. Minding Animals (https://www.mindinganimals.com/) and Animals and Social Change (https://digitalanimalities.org/upcoming-events/2017/1/24/the-cfhas-conference-event-animals-and-social-change) are examples of conference venues where students and veterinarians can get greater exposure to the dimensions of animal-human interconnections. Animal Welfare Judging and Assessment Contests also provide veterinary students with exposure and training about animal welfare and its multifaceted nature (www.awjac.org). In the US context, participation in professional organizations like the American College of Animal Welfare (ACAW) whose mission it is \u201cto advance animal welfare through education, certification, and scientific investigation\u201d (www.acaw.org), can help promote animal welfare competencies as a significant veterinary specialty.

Awareness of the current scientific developments within disciplines relevant to animal welfare science, such as animal behavior, evolutionary theory, epigenetics, epidemiology, experimental psychology, social, environmental sciences and so on, together with pedagogical tools, such as problem-solving methods, should be integrated alongside exposure to ethical frameworks (e.g., [98,99,100]), in order to open students\u2019 minds to new possibilities for advancing animals\u2019 welfare. Curricula initiatives targeting animal welfare outcomes should aim for the professional development of veterinarians, so that they are cognizant of the public interest in animal welfare and the public expectation for veterinarians to work with animal welfare in any veterinary discipline, conversing proficiently in multidisciplinary settings and being critical thinkers, as well as practical decision makers [5,7,8,23,24,36,37,38]. Veterinarians who are proficient in science-ethics communication, for example, will likely be considered as more credible interlocutors with different public audiences in their advocacy of animal issues [92]. Through exposure to ethics training and animal welfare science, veterinarians will develop the skills to reflect on and employ ethical thinking that has applications for animals ([7,8,36]; see also https://vet.purdue.edu/CAWS/bioethics/background.php, and http://www.slu.se/vethics) and will be able to provide strong reasoned arguments that reflect the voices of animals and meet societal expectations.",
