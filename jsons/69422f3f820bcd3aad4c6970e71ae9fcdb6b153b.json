This contagious and lethal virus has impacted patients and 4 healthcare workers alike. Elective surgeries have been suspended and the very core of our 5 healthcare system is being strained. The following brief communication reviews pertinent 6 details about the virus, delaying elective surgeries and what patients can do during this time. The 7 goal is to disseminate factual data that surgeons can then use to educate their patients. If a patient thinks they may have been exposed to the virus, they should contact their primary 91 care physician. If they are not symptomatic, simply quarantining for 14 days may suffice. If they 92 are having mild symptoms (similar to a common cold) their doctor may order a test to confirm 93 the diagnosis. If they are having severe symptoms such a difficulty breathing, they may be 94 referred to an emergency room for diagnosis, evaluation and treatment. ",

            "text": "people have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 as of the writing 13 of this article (COVID-19). [1] In comparison, the deadliest pandemic on record is the 1918 14 influenza pandemic (\"Spanish Flu\") with over 500 million people (33% of the world's 15 population at the time) afflicted and an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide. [2] At first 16 thought, orthopaedic surgeons would not be overly involved in the management of a highly 17 contagious lung disease. But with the rapid spread of virus in only weeks and the potential for 18 mortality between 5 to 20%, all healthcare providers will need to take an active role. [3] 19 20 This pandemic has already strained our medical resources and affected all sectors of healthcare, 21 especially elective surgical procedures. At some point, many orthopaedic surgeons will be called 22 upon to provide their expertise and compassionate care to COVID-19 patients with fractures, 23 infections, or other emergencies. In various 'hot spots' around the country, orthopaedic surgeons 24 are being redeployed to the front lines to assist medical teams in the emergency department, 25 hospital floors and intensive care units. It is an all-hands-on-deck effort to save lives. During this 26 time of need, orthopaedic providers can help limit the spread of the illness by educating patients 27 and by following recommended behaviors, such as hand hygiene and avoiding close social 28 contact. This allows us to provide leadership to our patients, staff, families and communities tremendous amount of media coverage, a large portion of our patient population likely 34 does not understand COVID-19. This disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is believed to 35 have emerged from a live animal market in Wuhan, China and was transmitted to humans 36 through close contact; although, there are competing theories on the viral origin. The virus is part 37 of a larger family of viruses called coronaviruses which are single-stranded ribonucleic acid 38 (RNA) viruses. [4] Coronaviruses are not new and classically have caused mild respiratory or 39 gastrointestinal symptoms in humans. [5] If the name SARS sounds familiar, it is because there 40 have been two strains related to outbreaks this century to include severe acute respiratory 41 syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 42 43 How does COVID-19 affect patients? 44 45 This viral illness spreads from person-to-person, primarily through respiratory droplets. This 46 mode of transmission is more common when people are in close proximity (within six feet) of 47 one another. It can also be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces (also known as 48 fomites) and then introducing them to the respiratory tract through the mucous membranes illnesses, quarantining the sick or symptomatic patients can help slow the spread. The 52 challenge with COVID-19 is that people can harbor the virus and display mild symptoms or even 53 be asymptomatic, making it easy to spread the illness to others. Most patients demonstrate 54 symptoms within 5 to 12 days of contracting the virus. [7] Patients can initially present with 55 fever (>100\u00b0F), cough, shortness of breath, headache, and fatigue. [8] Some cases have presented 56 with diarrhea and anosmia. More serious cases present with severe pneumonia and/or respiratory 57 failure, which can lead to death. Confirmation testing is of importance to help determine the 58 incidence of the disease and to direct quarantine measures. 59 60 Currently there are various options being employed and investigated to detect the virus and/or 61 antibodies to the virus to determine if someone has been exposed. Most importantly, these 62 resources are limited, and at this time, it is not recommended that all patients and healthcare 63 workers be tested. It is strongly recommended that an individual with the above described 64 symptoms should self-quarantine and get tested only if recommended by a medical professional, 65 instead of presenting to a testing facility or further straining the resources of local emergency 66 departments. 67 68 What can patients do to avoid COVID-19? 69 Given the ease of transmission and potential for severe symptoms including death, all efforts to 71 prevent the spread of the disease are imperative. Individuals over 65 years old with underlying 72 medical conditions that are not well controlled including obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary 73 disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, serious heart conditions, or a 74 weakened immune system are at higher risk for severe illness. [9] Patients can help by avoiding 75 contact with people who are ill. This has led many healthcare facilities (e.g. hospitals, nursing 76 homes, skilled nursing facilities) to ban all visitors. Stress can ensue when friends and family 77 members are hospitalized, but it is important to follow these guidelines. Many states and locales 78 have instituted social distancing policies with the goal of decreasing viral transmission; 79 therefore, it is important for the public to follow current regulations to avoid congregating and 80 gathering in groups. 81 82 Additionally, patients should remain vigilant about frequent hand washing. It is important to 83 educate patients about proper hand washing techniques and to advise them to avoid touching 84 their face without first washing their hands. Individuals should always cover their mouth or nose 85 when coughing or sneezing as well as disinfecting any contaminated areas. Recently, the Centers 86 for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended wearing cloth face coverings over the nose and 87 mouth while in public settings where social distancing would be difficult (grocery store or 88 pharmacy) to limit viral transmission.
