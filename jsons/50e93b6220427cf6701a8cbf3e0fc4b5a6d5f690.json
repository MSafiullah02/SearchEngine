This type of reasoning became somewhat more focused on the role of free radicals in cancer (Swartz\u201a 1979) .

            "text": "The next phase of theories potentially linking free radicals and disease was based on the specific potential of free radicals to initiate strong oxidizing reactions. The fundamental rationale comes from the fact that living organisms include many highly oxidizable components\u201a yet usually require the presence of oxygen in order to carry out basic metabolic functions. Interest in these aspects became greatly increased with the discovery of the natural occurrence of large amounts of superoxide dismutases in both the blood and cells. Subsequently a role of free radicals in almost every conceivable disease has been proposed on various theoretical grounds related to the potential for uncontrolled oxidations. Such theories have general support by observations that the extent of many pathologies can be modified by changing the availability of superoxide (especially by modifying the activity of superoxide dismutases) or the strongly oxidizing functions of macrophages. But the observations did not provide rigorous proof of causality\u201a and the chemical reactions through which the superoxide caused the observed effects has remained obscure.",

This has been puzzling when looked at critically\u201a because when considering the specific free radicals that are expected to be involved\u201a it has been difficult to construct plausible reaction schemes that would account for the observed effects. The hydroxyl radical and closely related species (e.g. the perferyl radical)\u201a are so reactive that they must be generated on or immediately adjacent to the target molecules\u201a because their diffusion distance is usually the distance to the next molecule. Therefore it would take very special circumstances for such radicals to be important in a disease. On the other hand\u201a the superoxide radical is so unreactive that it is difficult to understand how it can lead to the very profound effects that clearly are associated with excess or inappropriate production of superoxide.",

            "text": "The keys to the potential of much more effective progress have been the discoveries that oxidizing species and the amount of oxygen can have profound effects on gene activation and cell signaling. This has\u201a finally\u201a provided a potentially satisfactory mechanism for understanding the association of free radicals (and other oxidizing species) with pathophysiology. It has become clear that there are a large number of activators and modulators of genes and cytokines that respond to the presence of oxidizing species. Currently the understanding of the role of free radicals and other oxidizing species in cell signaling is still at an early stage\u201a but rapid progress is likely as the cascades of effectors that are activated or inactivated by the amount of oxidizing species and/or oxygen are delineated. It seems likely that in many cases the origin of the free radicals will be from inappropriate responses of the naturally occurring defense systems\u201a mediated through cell signaling. The old paradigm of deleterious actions of free radicals occurring through direct damage from the free radicals is likely to be applicable only in exceptional circumstances (e.g. ionizing radiation). Thus the experimental approaches in which roles of free radicals are likely to be important aspects for understanding probably will be in the arena of molecular biology\u201a and the role of EPR in these studies may be critical. This is perhaps even more exciting than the vague postulates of free radicals being \"bad\" and leading to disease\u201a because the responses of cells to the presence of oxidizing species are probably very fundamental properties of cellular systems. These mechanisms have enabled life to evolve in an environment with an abundant potential for deleterious oxidations\u201a due to an atmosphere that is 20% oxygen. With this understanding\u201a the value of EPR and related techniques to follow free radical reactions is likely to increase\u201a as the techniques are applied in experiments that are more appropriately framed.",

In general increases were not found\u201a although in a few cases in studies of cancer some unexpected EPR signals were seen (Swartz\u201a 1986). As noted in the review\u201a more thorough consideration of this approach leads to the conclusion that even if free radicals are involved\u201a there are seldom specific reasons for there to be increased amounts of free radicals that can be detected by EPR. The role of free radicals could be critical but transient. And even if there was a continuing role of free radicals\u201a the more reactive that they are\u201a the less likely it would be that they could be detected directly by conventional EPR spectroscopy.

This approach has been used productively, especially by Mason and colleagues (ch. 5) . It involves the administration of the spin trap to the animal and then obtaining samples through biopsies or removal of biological fluids. It can provide excellent evidence for the occurrence of free radical reactions in vivo, but considerable care is needed to avoid artifacts or misleading results. The potential problems include loss of spin adducts during the extraction steps and generation of spin adducts during the processing of the samples. c) direct spin trapping in vivo with measurements made directly in the organism under physiological conditions. In principle this is a very desirable approach, providing direct evidence without intervening processing steps and, also, the potential to provide kinetic data under physiological conditions. This approach, however, has lower sensitivity than ex vivo methods, because the latter can study the samples at X-band or even higher frequencies\u201a while direct in vivo studies require the use of L-band or even lower frequencies\u201a with the consequent power sensitivity of such frequencies. Both ex vivo and direct in vivo approaches share the problem of potential instability of the spin adducts\u201a which often are converted to non-paramagnetic products in the presence of functioning cells (Khan and Swartz\u201a 2002; Timmins et al.\u201a 1999) . spin trapping using combined NMR and EPR. This is a new approach whose utility has not been fully evaluated. In principle it provides a means to use the widespread availability of in vivo NMR\u201a and that is very attractive. The section by Berliner in this chapter provides an excellent summary of this approach. indirect assays based on reactions of free radicals with nitroxides or other paramagnetic labels. This has been especially advocated by Utsumi's group\u201a using the rate of disappearance of nitroxides.

In microsomal systems\u201a the enzymatic reduction of paraquat to its cation radical is catalyzed by the flavoenzyme NADPHcytochrome P-450 reductase. The paraquat radical is stable in the absence of oxygen. In the presence of oxygen\u201a paraquat is re-formed\u201a and superoxide is generated in a catalytic fashion with no net change occurring to the paraquat molecule. This process has been termed futile metabolism (Mason 1979\u201a 1982 . The mechanism of paraquat poisoning in man is a superoxidemediated toxicity that is completely analogous to the herbicide mode of action. The lung is the site of injury by paraquat because it accumulates there (Rose and Smith\u201a 1977) . The energy-dependent uptake of paraquat and the subsequent free radical formation are cell-specific. Paraquat free radical formation occurs with clara cells and alveolar type 2 cells\u201a but not with alveolar macrophages (Horton et al.\u201a 1986) . Diquat\u201a morfamquat\u201a and other bipyridylium compounds do not affect the lung as seriously\u201a but these compounds do cause liver damage and are reduced by rat hepatocytes to their respective radical cations (DeGray et al.\u201a 1991).",

The nitrofurantoin-catalyzed reduction of oxygen to superoxide and the hydrogen peroxide that forms from this superoxide may be responsible for some of the toxic manifestations that occur during nitrofurantoin therapy (Mason and Holtzman\u201a 1975b) .

Subsequent work with animal models supported this proposal (Peterson et al.\u201a 1982; Boyd et al.\u201a 1979) . Boyd and coworkers (1979) have shown that the acute toxicity of nitrofurantoin is markedly increased by vitamin E deficiency\u201a an oxygenenriched atmosphere\u201a or a diet high in highly polyunsaturated fats.

In both cases increased oxidative stress in sickle cell disease results in the oxidation of biological macromolecules which contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease (Hebbel et al.\u201a 1982; Klings et al.\u201a 2001; Natta et al.\u201a 1992; Repka and Hebbel\u201a 1991; Schacter\u201a 1986; Sheng et al.\u201a 1998) of free radicals and oxidants in the control of vascular function (as opposed to oxidative damage).",

            "text": "Another molecule that has only recently been implicated as a nitric oxide scavenger in sickle cell disease is plasma hemoglobin. A major paradox of nitric oxide function has been the presence of high (10 mM) concentrations of hemoglobin in the vascular lumen. Calculations have clearly shown that this level of hemoglobin should preclude nitric oxide radical from having any appreciable steady-state concentration in the vessel wall. This paradox has been recently addressed by the discovery that compartmentalized hemoglobin reacts with nitric oxide at significantly slower rates (up to 1000 times) than cell-free hemoglobin. The effects of increased levels of cell-free hemoglobin on vascular function have only recently been realized. As recently demonstrated by Reiter et al. (2002) \u201a the levels of plasma cell free hemoglobin are substantially elevated in patients with sickle cell disease\u201a averaging and as high as The hemoglobin appears to be in the ferrous form as the plasma from sickle cell patients exhibits a greater ability to scavenged nitric oxide. Measurements of blood flow in the forearm indicate that plasma hemoglobin can severely limit nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation. An important corollary of these studies is that pharmacologically administered nitric oxide (for example by inhalation) can act to 'scavenge the scavenger' by oxidizing plasma hemoglobin to its met or ferric derivative. Ferric hemoglobin then has limited ability to scavenge peripheral nitric oxide\u201a thus potentially restoring NO bioavailablility. The level of methemoglobin in plasma (as demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy) is increased when sickle-cell patients inhale nitric oxide\u201a together with the level of nitrosylhemoglobin (Reiter et al.\u201a 2002) . Cell-free hemoglobin circulating through the pulmonary circulation is a much more amenable target for nitric oxide therapy than guanylyl cyclase and it may be the case that the effects of nitric oxide inhalation in other clinical conditions are at least in part mediated through plasma hemoglobin oxidation. It is interesting to speculate that the ability of hydroxyurea\u201a recently identified as an NO congener\u201a to relieve sickle cell disease may also be at least in part related to its ability to oxidize hemoglobin in the extracellular compartment (Glover et al.\u201a 1999; Huang et al.\u201a 2002; Jiang et al.\u201a 1997) .",

Independent evidence for the intermediacy of was obtained from photolysis studies using the pentammine carbonate complex of Co (III). The UV photolysis of this cobalt complex has been shown to generate the authentic radical. This system yielded the same type of radical adducts in the presence of substrates (e. g., azide, ethanol, and formate) as detected in the system (Zhang et al., 2000 (Zhang et al., , 2002 . Bicarbonate-dependent peroxidase activity of SOD1 was found to be responsible for hydroxylation and oxidation of azulenyl nitrone to an aldehyde. Aldehyde formation was attributed to trapping of hydroxyl radicals by the azulenyl nitrone (Gurney et al., 1998) . Recently, we showed that in the absence of bicarbonate, oxidation of azulenyl nitrone to azulenyl aldehyde was negligible in phosphate buffers containing SOD1, and the chelator DTPA (Zhang et al., 2002) . Photolysis of solutions containing the cobalt complex that generates the carbonate radical anion and azulenyl nitrone yielded azulenyl aldehyde. Based on these results, we proposed that is responsible for mediated oxidation of azulenyl nitrone. Bicarbonate-dependent SOD1 peroxidase activity is, thus, inhibitable by nitrones.

Clearly\u201a ocular pigmentation\u201a particularly in the uveal tract\u201a protects the retina from overexposure by absorbing and scattering the impinging light. Melanin in the choroid and RPE contributes to visual acuity by preventing light reflection from the fundus. It has long been recognized that the severity of the visual abnormalities in albinism correlates with the degree of hypopigmentation (Kinnear et al.\u201a 1985) . However\u201a even with corrective tinted lenses that help photophobia and\u201a in a minor way\u201a vision by increasing contrast\u201a the results in albinos are rather disappointing (Taylor\u201a 1978) . It has been postulated that the albino visual system may represent a case of arrested development (Wilson et al.\u201a 1988) . Thus\u201a melanin synthesis in the RPE appears to be of crucial importance for normal development of the visual system of an organism\u201a and the presence of RPE is not only responsible for the maintenance of the neural retina but also for its successful embronic development and organization (Boissy et al.\u201a 1993; Raymond and Jackson\u201a 1995) .",

            "text": "Due to the close structural and functional association between the RPE and photoreceptors\u201a it is generally agreed that any oxidative damage to the RPE\u201a which causes RPE dysfunction\u201a could contribute to the photoreceptor degeneration that characterizes AMD. Thus\u201a the antioxidant status of the RPE may be a key factor in determining the tissue's health\u201a and the health of the photoreceptors that the RPE supports. An RPE antioxidant that may be particularly relevant when photic stress is implicated in tissue damage is the light-absorbing pigment melanin (Sarna\u201a 1992). It has been postulated that RPE melanin can protect the RPE from oxidative stress by sequestering redox active metal ions\u201a quenching electronically excited states of certain photosensitizing dye molecules and by scavenging reactive free radicals (Sarna et al.\u201a 1998; Rozanowska et al.\u201a 1999) . Significantly\u201a melanin content of the human eye seems to be inversely correlated with the incidence of AMD (Weiter et al.\u201a 1985; Young\u201a 1988 )\u201a and the risk of suffering from AMD is about 40 times higher in whites than in blacks (Pauleikhoff and Holz\u201a 1996) \u201a even though the inter-racial differences in the amount of ocular melanin mainly concern the uveal pigmentation. However\u201a it is important to realize that antioxidant abilities of melanin may change with age. Indeed\u201a a recent EPR study has shown that the amount of RPE melanin decreases by a factor of 2.5 between the first and ninth decade of life (Sarna et al.\u201a 2002) . In an independent study\u201a the melanin content of RPE melanosomes from human donors of different age was analyzed by EPR after drying the pigment granules (Bilinska et al.\u201a 2002) . Surprisingly\u201a the content of melanin\u201a when normalized to a single pigment granule\u201a was found independent of age. On the other hand\u201a RPE melanosomes from younger individuals could contain significantly higher percentage of strongly bound water\u201a that those from older individuals (Bilinska et al.\u201a 2002) . RPE melanosomes from older human donors exhibit increased photoreactivity: they induce faster oxygen photouptake and accumulation of superoxide anion spin adducts (Rozanowska et al.\u201a 2002) . Thus with age\u201a RPE melanin may contribute to oxidative stress in the outer retina both as a result of a decreased antioxidant efficiency and an increased aerobic photoreativity. Interestingly\u201a W-band EPR spectroscopy may provide a sensitive measure for differentiating RPE melanin from human donors of different age and monitoring possible chemical changes of the melanin that are likely to be aggravated with aging (Rozanowska et al.\u201a 1993) . In this preliminary study a striking pattern in the changes of magnetic parameters of melanin radicals with age was observed. Although the molecular nature of these changes is not yet understood\u201a they may result from life-long oxidative modifications of the RPE melanin.",

While both autooxidative reactions and enzymatic oxidation of dopamine are accompanied by the generation of hydrogen peroxide\u201a the former process can also lead to the formation of potentially cytotoxic semiquinones and quinones (Cohen\u201a 1983; Graham 1984) . Therefore\u201a the dopaminergic neurons of the SN and LC are intrinsically at risk of oxidative stress. Despite the presence of antioxidative mechanisms in catecholaminergic neurons for maintaining their neurotransmitters in a reduced state\u201a the system is not perfect and some semiquinones and quinones may escape from reduction and randomly form products that cannot be catabolized and gradually accumulate in lysosomes\u201a eventually becoming neuromelanin granules (Enochs et al.\u201a 1994) . It can be argued that when formed\u201a NM can exert its antioxidant action by binding of advantitious multivalent metal ions\u201a such as iron and copper (Swartz et al.\u201a 1992) . There is evidence that SN neurons in patients with PD exhibit an elevated level of oxidative stress (Jenner\u201a 1991). Thus the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione is decreased in Parkinsonian brains\u201a compared to normal brains (Riederer et al.\u201a 1989; Sofic et al.\u201a 1992) .",

The study has clearly shown that the yield of hydroxyl radicals generated via iron ion-catalyzed free radical decomposition of hydrogen peroxide dramatically decreased in the presence of synthetic NM (Zareba et al.\u201a 1995) . Both synthetic and natural NMs were able to inhibit peroxidation of lipids induced by iron/ascorbate or thermolabile azo-compounds . A hypothesis\u201a about the role of NM in the multifactioral etiology of PD was proposed by Enochs et al. (1994) : oxidative degradation of NM that can occur with aging or as a result of an intense or chronic oxidative stress in the pigmented neurons of SN could\u201a via positive feed-back mechanism\u201a further increase the level of the oxidative stress. Oxidatively modified NM is expected to have a decreased binding affinity for iron and other metal ions.

An average of about 1/3 of all tumor types appear to exhibit a genomic instability manifested by subtle nucleotide sequence alternations that activate proto-oncogenes or inactivate tumor suppressor genes. Chromosomal rearrangements are likely to be a result of aberrant recombination repair that occurs during normal cellular mitotic growth (Przybytkowski\u201a 2003; Friedberg\u201a 1985; Friedberg et al.\u201a 1995; Kucherlapati and Smith\u201a 1988) . A very large number of genes has been identified as tumor promoter genes or tumor suppressor genes (Cheng\u201a 2003; Stanbridge\u201a 1990; Weiberg\u201a 1989) . As far back as 1993\u201a genetic analysis of tumor cells has suggested that between 6 to 12 of these genes are altered during the development of a tumor (Renan\u201a 1993). The number of altered genes far exceeds the number of mutations that would be predicted by the spontaneous mutation rate in human cells. Of the several theories to account for this discrepancy\u201a the \"mutator hypothesis\" for tumorigenesis has gained much attention (Loeb\u201a 1991\u201a 1994 . In this hypothesis\u201a an early spontaneous mutation in one of many genes that maintain the genetic information in chromosomes becomes altered. This leads to genetic instability\u201a or a mutator phenotype\u201a either by accumulation of replicative errors or by gross chromosome rearrangement. A higher-than-normal mutation rate then leads to the combination of mutations in genes that regulate growth\u201a invasion\u201a or metastasis. Post-replication mismatch repair systems enhance the fidelity of DNA replication by correction of replicative errors. It has recently been shown that mutations in mismatch repair genes are associated with cancers (e.g. Jeong\u201a 2003; Worrillow\u201a 2003) .",

Guanine is the most easily oxidized of the nucleic acid bases (an electronloss center created in a system containing the four nucleic acid bases will eventually migrate to guanine) (Steenken\u201a 1989). The keto and enol forms of this damaged guanine are found in equilibrium. Thus\u201a the interchangeable use of 8-oxodG and 8-OHdG found in the literature. We will use the 8-oxoG terminology in this discussion. Since the last step in formation of 8-oxoG and 8-oxoA is an oxidation while the last step in the formation of Fapy-G and Fapy-A is a reduction (Breen and Murphy\u201a 1995; Steenken\u201a 1989 )\u201a it has been suggested that 8-oxoG formation is favored under the more oxidizing (pro-oxidant) conditions found in cancer cells (Malins et al.\u201a 2003; Malins\u201a 1993; Malins et al.\u201a 1993) \u201a or alternatively\u201a that a pro-oxidant condition exists in cells destined to become malignant favoring the accumulation of 8-oxoG. For instance\u201a the DNA of hepatitis B virus infected mouse liver cells destined to become tumorigenic had elevated levels of 8-oxoG (Hagen et al.\u201a 1994) . Whatever the reason\u201a 8-oxoG is considered to be a major stable product generated by ROS attack on DNA and it is excreted in the urine of humans where it is used as a biological marker of in vivo oxidative DNA damage (Halliwell\u201a 1993; Shigenaga et al.\u201a 1994) .",

            "text": "In order to minimize the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species\u201a all aerobic organisms possess extensive defense systems. The primary defense is achieved by decomposing superoxide and hydrogen peroxide\u201a which thus minimizes the formation of the ensuing hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH). This primary antioxidant defense system includes various enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms such as superoxide dismutase\u201a catalase\u201a glutathione peroxidase\u201a and ascorbic acid (e.g. Halliwell and Gutteridge\u201a 1989) . In addition\u201a although controversial\u201a data indicate that BCL-2\u201a the antiapoptotic protein also has antioxidant powers (Amstad et al.\u201a 2001) . The reactive oxygen species that escape from the primary defense system have a significant chance of damaging DNA. Several repair enzymes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have been shown to remove 8-oxoG residues from DNA providing a secondary line of defense. The mammalian repair enzyme hOGG1\u201a the human homolog of the yeast OGG1 is able to repair C/8-oxoG DNA damage back to CG in cells due to its 8-oxoG glycosylase /AP lyase activity (Gu et al.\u201a 2001; Aburatani et al.\u201a 1987; Arai et al.\u201a 1997; Friedberg et al.\u201a 1995; Hazra et al.\u201a 1998; Nash et al.\u201a 1996; Radicella et al.\u201a 1997; Ramotar and Demple\u201a 1993; Roldan-Arjona et al.\u201a 1997; Shibutani et al.\u201a 1991; Van der Kemp et al.\u201a 1996) . The mammalian MTH1 enzyme\u201a like the E. Coli MutT homolog eliminates 8-oxodGTP damage from the deoxynucleotide pool (Maki and Sekiguchi\u201a 1992) . Based on sequence homology with yeast OGG1\u201a hOOG1 has been cloned (Aburatani et al.\u201a 1997; Arai et al.\u201a 1997; Lu et al.\u201a 1997; Radicella et al.\u201a 1997; Roland-Arjona et al.\u201a 1997; Rosenquist et al.\u201a 1997; Shibutani et al.\u201a 1991) . If the 8-oxoG lesion is not removed by the hOGG1 protein before DNA replication\u201a then misincorporation of dA opposite to the 8-oxoG lesion occurs (Hazra et al.\u201a 1998; Moriya et al.\u201a 1991; Nghiem et al.\u201a 1988; Shibutani et al.\u201a 1991) . The mammalian hMYH enzyme\u201a like E. Coli MutY\u201a removes this misincorporated adenine from an A/8-oxoG mispair\u201a with the formation of C/8-oxoG\u201a which is then a substrate for hOGG1. This is considered the third level of defense (Au et al.\u201a 1989; McGoldrick et al.\u201a 1995; Slupska et al.\u201a 1996; Tsai-Wu et al.\u201a 1991; Yeh et al.\u201a 1991) . The MutY gene has been cloned and sequenced (Boiteux et al.\u201a 1987; Michaels et al.\u201a 1990; Michaels et al.\u201a 1991; Slupska et al.\u201a 1996) . In addition\u201a it has been shown that expression of the E. coli MutM gene which expresses Fpg\u201a an enzyme with the same activity as hOGG1 in mammalian cells\u201a reduces the mutagenicity of X-rays (Laval\u201a 1994). Furthermore\u201a germ line mutations in human genes hMSH2\u201a or hMLH1\u201a which express proteins with the ability to correct DNA mismatches and misalignments lead to genetic instability in microsatellite repeat sequences in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (Jeong et al.\u201a 2003; Bronner et al.\u201a 1994; Papadopoulos et al.\u201a 1994) \u201a It thus seems likely that the hOGG1/hMYH repair pathways are linked to protection against certain cancers.",

            "text": "An elevation of oxidative modifications in DNA has recently been reported in human cancers of the breast\u201a prostate (Malins and Haimanot\u201a 1991; Malins et al.\u201a 1993\u201a Malins et al.\u201a 2003 and other tissues (LePage et al.\u201a 2000; Olinski et al.\u201a 1992) . The 8-oxoG lesion has been suggested to be a putative link to cancer development (Malins et al.\u201a 2003; Malins\u201a 1993 ) and a predictor for breast cancer (Malins et al.\u201a 1995) . This modification occurs by the attack of hydroxyl radicals that arise from mediated by trace metal ions such as and (Luo et al.\u201a 1994) . Since diffuses readily across the nuclear membrane\u201a hydroxyl radicals are formed near DNA and modify it by attacking the purine and pyrimidine bases (Meneghini and Martins\u201a 1993) . Breast cancer is not commonly associated with pre-existing chronic inflammatory conditions\u201a unlike bowel cancer where a causal relationship between ulcerative colitis and bowel cancer has been suggested (Weitzman and Gordon\u201a 1990) . Breast lesions (benign or malignant) are\u201a however\u201a commonly infiltrated with macrophages\u201a which lead to oxidative stress. This in turn could lead to the progression of some cells from benign to malignant and/or facilitate the transformation to a more aggressive metastatic tumor. There are a number of tumorigenic cell lines including one from breast that chronically elaborate large quantities of (Szatrowski and Nathan\u201a 1991) that can lead to chromosome mutations and cancer (Emerit\u201a 1994) . In addition\u201a the most lethal form of locally advanced breast cancer is termed inflammatory breast cancer due to the acute inflammatory changes observed in patients with this type of malignancy (Jaiyesimi et al.\u201a 1992) . As mentioned above\u201a humans are exposed to considerable oxidative stress as judged by measurements of up to in urine (Long et al.\u201a 1999a\u201ab) . These levels vary with a normal diet. Halliwell concluded that urine contains \"autooxidizable proteins\" which upon exposure to oxygen result in the generation of to generate (Long et al.\u201a 1999a) . Exposing cells to can shift the cell to a prooxidant state\u201a which facilitates ROS damage to a variety of targets. We have shown this to be true in the benign human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (Gu et al.\u201a 2001) . MCF-10A is a spontaneously immortalized human breast cell line\u201a which has characteristics of human breast epithelium such as: lack of tumorigenicity in nude mice and lack of anchorage independent growth (Soule et al.\u201a 1990) . We treated these cells with 5 separate time after allowing for growth (P5 line) or gradually at increments until reaching (GP line). The peroxide decay and the concomitant production of OH radicals was measured by EPR using DMPO as mentioned earlier in this chapter (Figure 1 ). After exposure to hydrogen peroxide\u201a the cells became resistant to this oxidant and went on to exhibit different degrees of some of them being able to grow in immunodeficient mice (GP line). This transformation towards malignancy can be related to the cell's ability to bypass apoptosis to ensure survival\u201a cell cycle anomalies modulated by oxidative stress-induceable genes and the lack of repair of 8-oxoG in DNA (Gu et al.\u201a 2001) . With respect to the latter damage\u201a the role of hOGG1 and hMYH repair enzymes in mammalian tumor progression is to maintain genetic stability by avoiding G . C T . A transversions. This is based on the work on E. coli MutY and MutM gene mutants. Cells with a single mutation in these genes are moderate mutators; however\u201a cells with a double mutation in MutY and MutM genes have mutation rates three orders of magnitude higher than the wild-type cells Cabrera et al.\u201a 1988) . Overexpression of these genes will reduce the transversion mutations in tumor promoter genes or tumor suppressor genes and thus reduce the risk of tumorigenesis. Thus\u201a if indeed the role of 8-oxoG in breast cancer tumorigenesis is established\u201a one application to the treatment of cancer would be elevating the enzymes that repair such lesion over the endogenous levels present in healthy tissue.",

This section describes alternate approaches to overcoming some of these obstacles\u201a combining the two magnetic modalities that Jim Hyde has used so productively\u201a often in combination with the use of spin traps. Spin traps have the potential advantages of being able to accumulate (\"trap\") highly reactive radicals that could not be otherwise observed directly\u201a due to sensitivity limits and kinetic considerations. This is clearly the case for the hydroxyl radical\u201a which may be directly observed only by fast freeze quenching at liquid nitrogen temperatures and quickly undergo secondary radical reactions and interconversions. Obviously\u201a quickly immersing a mouse into liquid nitrogen negates an in vivo experiment! Many of the applications\u201a successes and pitfalls of in vivo spin trapping are reviewed in this volume by Mason (ch. 5) . A major problem that is difficult to overcome is the tendency of the living cell to reduce radicals; consequently\u201a the nitroxyl product of a nitrone radical adduct is normally bioreduced to the diamagnetic hydroxylamine. This section discusses potential alternatives utilizing NMR as the ultimate spectroscopic probing method. It also considers the use of more conventional NMR techniques to further characterize the spin traps and their metabolism.",

There are additionally other limits to distinguishing tissue boundaries with radical distributions; these are simply more difficult to visualize by EPR. On the other hand, MRI, which is a mature, commercialized technology, offers exquisite anatomical resolution based on the protons of water (i.e. 100 M). Several physical aspects, such as nuclear relaxation times, diffusion rates, oxygen magnetic susceptibility effects, etc., allow multifaceted approaches to EPR and MRI image resolution. On the other hand, paramagnetic compounds serve as excellent contrast agents in MRI by inducing proton (nuclear) relaxation enhancement from rapidly exchanging water molecules. Consequently, MRI spin trapping potentially allows visualization of free radical biology at the site of its generation, by using the spin adducts as \"contrast agents\".",

There also are many situations where the involvement of free radicals is minimal or not significant. EPR spectroscopy, combined with thoughtful experimental approaches can be a powerful method for resolving many of the questions that arise regarding the role of free radicals in disease. The National Biomedical ESR Center at MCW has had, and will continue to have an important role in providing critical EPR spectroscopy tools and original experimental results that will provide an understanding of the role of free radicals in disease. There appear to be sufficient important problems to make this a productive field for many years.",
