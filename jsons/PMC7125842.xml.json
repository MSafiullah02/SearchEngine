Potential donors presenting a health hazard are asked to exclude themselves. Medical information of donors is acquired and archived. Continuous epidemiologic surveillance of the donor population is being required in some jurisdictions.2 It helps to establish the background level (prevalence and incidence) and trends of known infectious markers (eg, HIV 1 and 2 antibodies, hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibodies, and hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) in the population. This is also of interest for the early detection of emerging diseases, allowing early implementation of counter measures (such as more stringent donor screening processes or requirements for additional testing procedures).",

In most situations, eligibility of whole blood donors and apheresis donors overlap, apart from donation frequency which is higher for plasmapheresis donors. Eligibility criteria take into account scientific information about the risks of transmission of infectious agents by pooled plasma products (which may differ from those by blood components).

            "text": "Currently, about 35% of the plasma fractionated in the world is obtained by centrifugation of whole blood (\u201crecovered\u201d plasma), and 65% is obtained by apheresis. Blood/plasma collection, processing, and storage may affect plasma quality, as well as having an impact on the recovery of the most labile proteins such as FVIII. In particular, risks of activation of the coagulation, complement, and fibrinolytic systems, which may lead to generation of plasma proteases, should be avoided. To better preserve the integrity of recovered plasma and limit risks of activation of the coagulation cascade and of cellular components, (a) good mixing of the blood with the anticoagulant solution (a sodium citrate based solution1) should be ensured from the initiation till the end of the collection process; (b) the duration of the collection should not exceed 15 minutes; and (c) temperature variations of the blood should be avoided. A few hours after donation, whole blood is subjected to a centrifugation that separates the cellular elements (most specifically red cells) from plasma. The mean plasma volume obtained from one whole blood donation is about 220 mL but varies depending upon the volume of collected whole blood (most often 400-450 mL) and donor's hematocrit. Apheresis plasma (also called \u201csource plasma\u201d) is collected from donors through a process where blood is removed from the donor, anticoagulated (generally with a 4% sodium citrate solution),1 and immediately separated by physical means (centrifugation or filtration, or a combination of both) into components.3 At minimum, the red cells are returned to the donor while plasma is retained and collected in a container (bag or plastic bottle). The duration of a typical plasmapheresis procedure depends on the number of cycles (and, hence, the volume of plasma collected) and lasts generally from 35 to 70 minutes. Apheresis plasma volume may range from 450 to 880 mL, depending upon the country's regulations and collection protocol. Apheresis plasma can also be prepared as a by-product of plateletpheresis (\u201cconcurrent plasma\u201d), a procedure used primarily for the collection of platelets.",

The mean content in coagulation factors, more particularly FVIII, is lower in recovered than in apheresis plasma because of (a) longer processing time before freezing (whole blood must be further processed to separate cellular components and plasma), (b) higher ratio of anticoagulant and, possibly, (c) the higher level of cellular contamination that may release proteolytic enzymes affecting the stability of coagulation factors. Apheresis plasma contains less IgG when collected from frequent donors. Protein content and quality of fractionated proteins is apparently not affected by the apheresis system used, although residual cell content differ based upon the type and configuration of the cell separation device.4 Plasma from membrane apheresis procedures, as does recovered plasma prepared from whole blood leukoreduced on positively charged filters, may contain more activated complement component 3 and 5 (C3a, C5a) anaphylatoxins,5, 6, 7 but the impact on the quality or yield of fractionated products is unknown.",

            "text": "Various infectious agents have been identified as potential contaminants of human blood.8 Bacteria, parasites, and intracellular viruses are not transmitted by plasma products because they are destroyed by freeze-thaw steps or removed by the 0.2- to 1-\u03bcm filtration steps used during the processing of fractionated products. Pathogenic plasma-borne viruses include HIV, HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), West Nile virus (WNV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and parvovirus B19 (B19). The various complementary safety nets in place during the production chain of fractionated products, from donor selection to industrial product extraction, to optimize safety against these agents are summarized in Table 1. The importance of viral testing on the safety of plasma products has been reviewed.1, 9, 10 The extent of viral testing of plasma for fractionation takes into account the ability of validated fractionation processes to eliminate viral risks.11 Some testing is performed by blood establishments, other by plasma fractionators (Table 1). Individual plasma donations must be negative for anti-HIV 1 and 2, anti-HCV, and HBsAg. Genomic assays of plasma minipools for nonenveloped HAV and B19 may be performed.11, 12 Relevance of testing for the absence of HIV P24Ag or WNV nucleic acid testing (NAT), which may be justified for the safety of non\u2013virally inactivated blood components, is arguable for plasma for fractionation subjected to robust viral reduction steps of enveloped viruses. The industrial manufacturing pool (usually the cryo-poor plasma that is the first homogeneous pooled plasma fraction) is also tested to confirm the absence of serologic and/or genomic viral markers of HIV, HBV, HCV, HAV, and B19. In spite of the most rigorous donor screening and donation testing, infectious viruses may still be present in plasma fractionation pools. Therefore, the viral inactivation-removal steps that have been deliberately introduced during plasma products manufacture\u2014and that are described below\u2014play a most critical role in ensuring safety. Altogether, these overlapping tests should ensure that the viral load of the manufacturing pool is both minimal and significantly below the viral reduction capacity of the manufacturing processes used.",

Apheresis plasma can generally be frozen quickly, ensuring optimal FVIII preservation. By contrast, whole blood has to be centrifuged to separate the various components. When blood is cooled to 4\u00b0C after collection, plasma should be separated and frozen within 6 to 8 hours to preserve FVIII, but when cooled rapidly at constant 20\u00b0C using devices like butanediol plates, coagulation factors are stable for up to 18 to 24 hours. Plasma frozen within 72 hours is suitable for IgG and albumin production.1 After separation from cellular elements, plasma for fractionation should be frozen rapidly below \u221220\u00b0C, \u221225\u00b0C, or \u221230\u00b0C, depending upon local regulations.13 Plasma used to manufacture only albumin and IgG may be frozen below \u221220 \u00b0C within 72 hours of collection.13 In the US Code of Federal Regulations, apheresis plasma should be stored at \u221220\u00b0C or colder immediately after collection. Rapid plasma freezing, to ensure rapid ice front velocity and core temperature of \u221220\u00b0C, preserves FVIII and appears more important than the actual freezing temperature itself.14 Plasma for fractionation is stored at less than \u221220 \u00b0C, or colder, typically for several months or more. Storage temperature should be as constant as possible, including the transportation to the fractionation facilities.

Plasma is immediately quarantined in a walk-in freezer. Documentation is verified (such as signed certificate of origin and of control of the plasma; collection date, shipping container number, virology and immunohematology screening data; test kits used and batch number) and reconciled with actual delivery. Additional testing, such as mini-pool NAT (eg, HCV, HIV, HBV, HAV, and/or B19) and/or statistical determination of FVIII and protein content by sacrificial sampling of individual plasma donations may be done. Only individual plasma donations that comply with quality and testing requirements are used for fractionation.

Frozen plasmas are expelled from the plastic containers and pooled for cryoprecipitation and further manufacturing steps, as described below. Intermediate fractions generated during production may be stored for subsequent pooling and processing. Purified sterile-filtered products are aseptically dispensed into final containers (glass vials or bottles). Albumin bottles undergo terminal pasteurization. Many products, but albumin and some IgG preparations, are freeze-dried, typically for a duration of 3 to 6 days, depending upon physicochemical characteristics and filled volumes. Batches are quarantined while quality controls and checks of production files take place. Batches meeting specifications are labeled and packaged and subsequently boxed and shipped for distribution.

This process involves successive processing steps at defined ethanol concentrations, associated with shifts in pH, temperature, and osmolality that result in selective precipitation of proteins, most notably IgG and albumin. Precipitates are separated by centrifugation or filtration. In the last few years, the complexity of the fractionation process has increased by (a) the introduction of chromatography to isolate new proteins from existing fractions such as cryoprecipitate, cryo-poor plasma, and Cohn fractions; (b) the integration of chromatography to the ethanol fractionation process to increase IgG recovery; and (c) the implementation of dedicated viral inactivation or removal steps. Chromatography was introduced in the 1960s; however, its application developed mostly in the mid/late 1980s. Anion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography are frequently used to capture proteins at physiological pH and ionic strength, therefore best preserving functional activity.17, 18 Immobilized heparin and monoclonal antibodies are common affinity chromatography ligands. Chromatography is used for 4 specific goals: (a) improvement of products purity, (b) extraction of trace labile proteins, (c) optimization of protein recovery, and (d) removal of viral inactivation agents.",

Cryoprecipitate is isolated using refrigerated continuous centrifuges, recovered from the centrifugation bowls and frozen at \u221230\u00b0C or colder for storage until further pooling and processing. The cryo-poor plasma is immediately processed for primary chromatographic capture of labile coagulation factors (such as the factor IX [FIX] complex and its components) and protease inhibitors (such as AT and C1 esterase inhibitor [C1-inh]). The prepurified intermediates may be stored frozen until further processing. The coagulation factors/anticoagulant-depleted plasma undergoes sequential ethanol precipitation steps. This leads to successive precipitations of fibrinogen, IgG and albumin fractions, and intermediates for extraction of other therapeutic proteins, such as AAT (fraction IV-1), or IgM (fraction III). Depth filtration is preferred to centrifugation to separate precipitates and improve protein recovery. The fractionation of hyperimmune plasma (eg, anti-rhesus) is usually performed on small plasma batch sizes, increasingly using full chromatographic processes to optimize the recovery of IgG.",

Because of its biological nature, the prion agent is thought to be resistant to current viral inactivation procedures used during plasma fractionation. The methods known to inactivate abnormal misfolded prion proteins associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (PrPTSE) (such as oxidation, treatment with strong base, chaotropic agents, and extreme heat) destroy plasma proteins and, therefore, cannot be used. Still, modern processes of fractionated products would seem to ensure significant removal of PrPTSE, as suggested by experimental spiking studies.32 As scale-down and experimental transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) spiking models are developed, knowledge on the capacity of manufacturing processes of plasma proteins to remove prions is growing rapidly, although much uncertainty remains because the unknown biological nature of the human plasma associated infectious agent.33 Several processes for manufacturing FVIII, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (VWF), FIX, IgG, and albumin products have been shown to be capable of remaining prions in a consistent and reproducible manner.34, 35, 36 Generally, multistep fractionation processes are thought to be a contributing factor to PrPTSE elimination. Two to more than 5 log removals of spiked prions occur during standard protein purification steps such as precipitation with ethanol or polyethylene glycol (PEG), anion-exchange chromatography, and depth filtration.34, 35, 37 Mechanism of removal that may encompass an adsorption mechanism is still not fully understood and appears to be influenced by pH and the concentration of the precipitating agent. The partitioning process may reflect some prion aggregation because of prion hydrophobicity and insolubility. The removal capacity of nanofiltration membranes with pore sizes less than 75 or 35 nm has been extensively investigated,34, 38 and prion removal is likely due in part to molecular sieving. Extent of removal is related to the pore size of the filters and, presumably, to the aggregation state of PrPTSE. Removal is superior with membrane of pore sizes of 15 nm, compared to 35 nm. The nature and origin of the spiking agent used for PrPTSE clearance studies is of critical importance because various spikes differ in size and characteristics. Brain homogenate or brain-derived microsomal fractions from infected animals have usually been used as the source of PrPTSE spiking material. The most reliable and quantitative detection method of PrPTSE is based on animal bioassays, which require many animals and a time frame generally longer than 9 months. In vitro immunochemical methods, such as a Western blot assay, are being used, at least as a first marker of the presence of PrPTSE and associated infectivity, by detecting the protease-resistant fragment.33 Thus, the risk transmission of vCJD by human plasma products appears remote, but caution should prevail since the biochemical nature of the infectious agent in human blood is not known.",

Current development efforts focus on establishing prion removal.36 All currently licensed plasma-derived FVIII concentrates are purified from cryoprecipitate. In a typical process, cryoprecipitate is subjected to a combination of aluminium hydroxide adsorption and precipitation, or precipitation only (eg, using glycine), to reduce the level of trace vitamin K coagulation factors (as they may activate FVIII during the downstream purification steps) or load proteins such as fibrinogen. The purified cryoprecipitate extract usually undergoes viral inactivation typically by SD or pasteurization. Many processes include subsequent chromatography by anion exchange, monoclonal antibody affinity (using anti-FVIII or anti-VWF murine antibodies), or immobilized heparin affinity to remove protein contaminants (such as fibrinogen or fibronectin), most or part of the VWF, and the SD agents.39 Immunopurified FVIII eluate is further purified by chromatography to remove murine IgG ligands that may have leached. Prior to formulation and sterile filtration, some FVIII products are nanofiltered using membranes with a pore size of 35, 20, or even 15 nm if a partial dissociation of FVIII and high-molecular-weight VWF multimers is initiated. Alternatively, some freeze-dried preparations are subjected to heat treatment at 80\u00b0C or 100\u00b0C to inactivate nonenveloped viruses like HAV. Recovery of FVIII, as expressed per liter of plasma, is usually comprised between 100 and 200 IU (1 IU is defined as the physiological activity present in 1 mL of plasma). Factors lowering FVIII yield include cryoprecipitation (ca 30% loss), chromatographic purification (ca 20% to 30 %), and viral heat inactivation (15%-30%). Current FVIII concentrates have a specific activity between 10 and 250 IU/mg. Some products are formulated with human plasma\u2013derived albumin, whereas others contain copurified VWF that helps stabilize FVIII. Purity of FVIII concentrates has not been convincingly demonstrated to enhance immunological safety. Long-term clinical experience indicates that the alleged reduced immunosuppressive effects of immunopurified preparations compared to lower-purity plasma-derived preparations, as claimed in the late 1990s, were probably unfounded. Processes used that, in part, influence residual VWF, may have an impact on the immunogenicity of plasma-derived FVIII products. Retrospective studies of previously untreated patients show that an SD-treated, nanofiltered, ion-exchange purified FVIII product containing VWF appears to be 2 times less likely to induce anti-FVIII inhibitors in hemophilia A patients than 2 full-length recombinant FVIII concentrates.40\n",

Most preparations are recovered from fraction IV1-4. Purification from this waste fraction is rather cumbersome and involves PEG precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography, considerably compromising recovery (\u223c0.2 g/L).

Loss of a C-terminal positive charged lysine, secondary to carboxypeptidase activity, was proposed as an explanation for these isoelectrofocusing migration shifts.

Intravenous use of a FXIII concentrate was found to increase epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2, suggesting that it may accelerate wound healing of anastomotic leaks and nonhealing fistulas.

            "text": "A review on plasma fractionation should also cover the role played by national and international regulatory authorities. Over the last few years, assuring the safety of large-pool plasma products has posed formidable challenges to regulatory authorities and fractionators alike. The complexity of the field, encompassing the diversity in blood and plasma product types and manufacturing processes, made it difficult to enact balanced decisions toward ensuring both product safety and guarantee of supply. Since the 1980s, the agencies regulating the plasma fractionation industry have developed a comprehensive set of measures to ensure the viral safety of plasma products. Multiple layers of regulatory oversight of the plasma industry have been established to ensure overlapping safeguards against the risks of the transmission of blood-borne infectious agents. Several regulations, guidances, position statements have been issued by agencies like the US FDA and the European Medicine Evaluation Agency, which are updated as needed. Those cover important safety aspects required at all stages of the manufacturing chain, from activities at blood establishment preparing plasma for fractionation, extending to the manufacturing and distribution of plasma products. Regulatory oversight includes epidemiologic surveillance of the donor population; donor deferral policies and screening practices; mandatory donation testing; testing of manufacturing plasma pools; validation of viral reduction procedures and other production steps; as well as the assessment of product quality, safety, and efficacy for marketing authorization. Most of relevant information on plasma collection is assembled in Europe in the Plasma Master File, which allows establishing key levels of information regarding the quality and safety of the plasma raw material. Post marketing, reports on adverse reactions associated with plasma products should be transmitted to NRAs and could prompt emergency response procedures and product recalls.10 Some harmonization of the requirements for manufacture and supply of plasma products in the United States, Europe, and Japan is taking place under the auspices of the International Conference on Harmonisation, but much work remains to be done. Such measures, nonetheless, provide the framework through which modern plasma products now exhibit a very high level of quality, safety, and efficacy. However, the rigidity of the regulatory system has been an impediment to more significant technological evolution of the plasma fractionation process because process changes are currently associated to major regulatory work.",

Today, more than 20 different protein products, and more if one considers the variety of hyperimmune IgG preparations, can be extracted through large-scale fractionation of human plasma. The soundness and large-scale adaptability of the technology, on the one hand, and the rigidity of the current regulatory framework, on the other, explains why this technology remains the main core method in use at industrial scale, although it implies suboptimal yield for most proteins, apart from albumin. The technology has increased in complexity over the years, with the greatest progresses in purification being, without doubt, associated with the use of chromatographic methods that have made possible the development of new protein therapeutics and impressive improvements in product purity and quality. The fractionation scheme has also changed dramatically through the introduction of in-process viral reduction treatments, which have required the addition of downstream techniques such as chromatography and ultrafiltration.",

The production of IgG from precipitate (I)+ II+III, already implemented by some manufacturers and, possibly, that of AAT from supernatant (I)+ II+III, are signs of a gradual evolution in the direction of total chromatographic processing. With so much gained, over the last few years, in the understanding of the key parameters building plasma product quality, safety, and efficacy, one can hope that the regulatory paths, in particular, with regard to clinical studies, to license known protein therapeutics prepared by improved, more efficient technology should be simplified. This would, in turn, contribute to an improved supply.",

The new market drivers in rich countries are likely to diminish economical interest in the manufacture of FVIII that remain a major protein therapy in need in the developing world. The belief that decreased use of plasma-derived FVIII or FIX in developed economies (as hemophiliacs are switching to recombinant therapies) would increase the supply of products to developing countries may be not economically viable. Rather, this switch to recombinant products in rich countries can make poor countries unable to afford the increased cost of products no longer subsidized by the premium price paid in rich countries. It therefore remains important to develop affordable viral inactivation and processing technologies gradually allowing developing countries to make use of local plasma resources in a safe manner.59\n",
