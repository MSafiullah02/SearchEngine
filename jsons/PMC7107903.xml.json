Louria et al. [7] were perhaps the first to clarify the nature of pneumonia during the influenza epidemic of 1957\u20131958. They separated primary influenzal pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia occurring in the wake of influenza and mixed viral-bacterial pneumonias. Louria et al. identified 6 adult patients they felt had pneumonia due to influenza virus on the basis of virus isolation or serologic criteria and absence of significant bacteriologic findings. Five of the 6 patients died. During the same epidemic, Martin et al. [8] identified 32 fatal cases of influenza, 29 of which occurred in patients aged \u226515 years. Eleven patients in this study were classified as having influenza without bacterial complications, including 4 with pneumonia or perihilar congestion. Oseasohn et al. [9] reported 33 fatal cases of Asian influenza, of which 9 were associated with \u201csterile cultures\u201d and at least 1 involved apparent primary influenzal pneumonia, and Kaye et al. [10] described 3 cases attributed to influenza virus pneumonia.",

More than 80% of infections, including pneumonia, associated with these viruses occur in children, especially those <4 years old, but they account for 1%\u20137% of adult respiratory infections [32]. In military recruitment centers [33, 34], febrile respiratory disease is common, and cases of pneumonia have been reported [35]. Pneumonia cases in recruits were milder, were preceded by upper respiratory tract symptoms, and included rales and rhonchi on auscultation, leukocyte counts that were not elevated, and infiltrates on chest radiographs that were patchy and irregular or reticular. Resolution occurred in all 12 military patients described by Bryant and Rhoads [35]. However, Dudding et al. [36] reported fatal outcomes for 3 other trainees with adenoviral pneumonia. Recent reports have included adults who were immunosuppressed and experienced disastrous consequences from adenoviral pneumonia [37], but reports of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults have also been published, as reviewed by Clark et al. [38]. These authors found 19 articles reporting on 21 immunocompetent patients with adenoviral pneumonia. The mean age of these patients was 40 years, and fever (90%), cough (81%), and dyspnea (71%) were frequent. The median leukocyte count was 7.7 cells/mm3, but 52% of patients were lymphopenic. The most common radiograph finding was bilateral interstitial markings. Pneumonia due to adenovirus has also been reported in closed populations of adults [39].",

Bacterial superinfections in the lungs (in 30% of cases), sinuses, and ears were common. Liver function abnormalities were also common, but none of these patients died.

Hypoxia was common, sometimes requiring the use of ventilators. Radiographic findings were nonspecific, but ground-glass-appearing lesions were commonly seen on computed tomographic scans of the lungs in this group. Ramsey et al.
