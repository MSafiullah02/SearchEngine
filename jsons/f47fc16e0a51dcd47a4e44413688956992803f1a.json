            "text": "Cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal commonly found in the environment, can cause toxic reactions at a dose of 30 mg. Cd is absorbed into the body mainly through the respiratory tract, digestive tract, and skin. (1) About 10%-50% of Cd absorption is inhaled dust, then about 5%-10% of ingested Cd is absorbed by body, which depending on particle size. (2) As known, most of Cd poisoning reaction is chronic, and acute Cd poisoning, especially high doses of acute poisoning, is very rare in clinic. Due to its airless and tasteless characteristics, Cd poisoning is hidden, and it is easy to be misdiagnosed in hospitals. However, Cd poisoning is particularly dangerous because it progresses rapidly and can cause death within hours. In order to better understand the treatment of Cd poisoning, we report a successful treatment case of a young man with multiple organ failure due to Cd poisoning. The patient gave a written informed consent, and the case report was approved by the Ethical Committee of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine.",

Based on CM theory, qi permanently protects the body and prevents the attacks from the disease. Baduanjin exercise is a traditional Chinese health Qigong routine created by an ancient physician for health promotion. The Baduanjin sequential therapy is a cardiac rehabilitation exercise developed by our intensive care medicine team, which consists of the sitting and standing forms. Baduanjin sequential therapy meets the characteristics of modern low intensity and long time aerobic exercise. In addition, Baduanjin exercise can systematically mobilize movable joints and muscles, enhance cardiopulmonary functions, and concurrently modulate mind and spirit, ultimately achieving the integration of the mind and body. (26, 27) This patient was taught with the sitting form of Baduanjin exercise, (28) which included 8 postures. The patient practiced Baduanjin exercise every day and was restored from sickness.",

Therefore, a diagnosis should be made quickly and treatment decisions of organ supporting need a deep consideration. Given the ubiquity of Cd in the environment and the multi-system toxicity of Cd as discussed previous, the CaNa 2 EDTA treatment was benign in clinical protocols, though toxicity of kidneys needed to be monitored. The role of CM in treating patients with poisoning was not negligible, especially in the early rehabilitation of patients.",
