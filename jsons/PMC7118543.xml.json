In recent studies, up to 80% of patients infected with COVID-19 present with mild respiratory tract symptoms or mild pneumonia, and 1.2% of patients have no symptoms [2,3]. The screening of patients having infection risks relies mostly on emergency personnel in Taiwan. Large numbers of patient with plausible symptoms presented to the emergency department (ED) each day. The stakes of cross-infection in unidentified patients are high, especially in hospital without buffer zone for infectious diseases. As we know, unexpected community outbreak has caused in-hospital infection, infection of health care providers or temporary shutdown of emergency service in hospitals at Wakayama, Japan and Daegu, Korea.",

Patients presented with fever or respiratory tract symptoms are classified as having high, intermediate or undetermined risks of COVID-19 infection. The principles of classification are shown in Table 1\n. Three areas A, B and C were set close to the ED. Area A is located outside the hospital and had good ventilation of air. Area B and C are located in the emergency hall and have independent air conditioning system (Fig. 1\n). The seatings of all 3 areas are arranged that the distances between patients are more than 1 m. High risk patients will be guided to area A, managed and admitted as soon as possible. Intermediate risk patients have history taken and portable X-ray obtained of needed at area B. Patients with undetermined risk of infection would wait, be inspected and treated at Area C. If respiratory sampling is required, intervention will be done in the isolation room. Critically ill patients with any suspicious TOCC history or respiratory problem are resuscitated in the isolation room. Medical staffs participating in the resuscitation wear personal protective clothing and use HEPA filter for ventilation.",
