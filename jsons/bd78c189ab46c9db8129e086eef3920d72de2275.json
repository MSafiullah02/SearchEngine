The state-owned company, Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) operates the railways in Indonesia and the network is badly in need of new investments. Recently, a sharp increase of train accidents occurred which are mostly due to the ageing infrastructure. Many railway crossings are found with no security gates, particularly in rural areas, and in 2003, it was reported that 31% of locomotives and 45% of coaches had been operating for more than 30 years. In countering these issues, the House of People's Representative has passed a new rail transport bill in 2007 which will allow the private sector to provide rail transport for the first time. Government regulations are still required before the law takes effect, and the state will continue to set train fares. This new legal framework may promote foreign investments in rail transport, which may support the future long-term planned high-speed 800 km rail link project between Jakarta and Surabaya. \u2022 Roads:",

There are also a number of payments on the road for road users, which range from tolls, both legal and illegal, to extortion payments demanded by the police or illegal criminal organizations. Hindrance in road network investments includes the risk of rising land acquisition costs. By buying up land earmarked for new toll roads, politically connected land speculators have caused the land acquisition costs of projects to spiral.

In 2004, about 55% of households in Indonesia were able to consume electricity, which stood at 509 kWh per head in 2005. Electricity demand had risen sharply in recent years, with the rate growing at 11% annually in 2002-2006 in the main regions of Java and Bali. The provision of electricity is the responsibility of the state-owned electricity company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN). However, PLN had inefficiencies in its management, followed by bad business practices and corruption which recently operated in a perpetual situation of nearbankruptcy. PLN's problems have been combined by a heavy reliance on oil-based fuels, which have risen sharply in cost in recent years. Rising oil prices and serious financial problems have forced the company to take vital measures to reduce dependence on oil-based fuels. Based on EIU's current report (EIU 2010a), some progress have been made in order to raise electricity-generating capacity. The efforts were initialized on an US$8 billion programme to develop 10 GW of new coal-fired generating capacity. The programme is planned to be completed by 2012, although delays are likely to occur. The new capacity will come from ten large power stations in Java and 30 smaller plants on other islands, and these projects are mostly funded by Chinese investors. In addition to this programme, the government is also planning a second phase of investments in the power sector, with another 10 GW of capacity which is expected to be generated by 2014.",

In business development, the essential activity is to create relationships with existing and prospective customers. This is conducted in order to capture market and obtain projects. A comprehensive market research related to its business area is also important in this phase. Secondly, procurement activities consist of creating and maintaining relationships with subcontractors and suppliers. These relationships are needed for obtaining resources and delivering the work packages. In supporting these, efficient and effective procedures for material purchase and management should be developed. Following or in parallel with the procurement activities, construction operations consist of activities related to constructing the product through the chosen construction methods. This activity is also supported by cost and schedule estimation and control, project management system, quality management and safety management system. Last but not least, post-construction services focus on the after-construction phase. The warranty of the product that was delivered should be well-managed (particularly in handling defects after the hand-over phase) and coordination with the customer or user is essential. Supporting activities in a contractor's business include the basic organizational structure, its employees and equipment, as well as human resource management programs and policies to attract, develop, and maintain a motivated, skilled team of employees. Elements that must be considered in the firm's infrastructure are the adequacy and location of facilities and equipment, the efficiency and effectiveness of its finance and accounting system, and its information management system. These are necessary because in managing construction projects, the firm will mostly create a project-based (site) office which is near or in the project location. The head office of the firm may not be located in the same area as the site office. Therefore, good coordination between these offices should be managed and maintained during the project phase. Regarding the firm's HRM, establishing procedures for employee recruitment and development, creating an encouraging work environment, creating and maintaining good relationships with unions, and focusing on employee's level of motivation and job satisfaction are needed to achieve the business goals. The value chain for contractor in doing its business is illustrated in Table 6 .3, describing the elements in its primary and support activities.",

The impacts were that the investment level of property, real estate and construction diminished significantly, with a sharp drop in construction business which led to bankruptcy, where the growth rate became \u00c037.5% and companies laid off more than 1.4 million workers, and with high unemployment faced by the contractors. In responding to this crisis, the government provided public work programs for the unemployed construction workers. But this was a temporary program and there were problems related to the program such as the mismatch in job tasks, lack of program dissemination, and ineffectiveness in managing the program. Moreover, currency and inflation control by the government provided some slow recovery for the construction sector.",

            "text": "\u2022 2008 financial crisis (Suryadharma 2008) This crisis started from the global economic downturn, which led to increased interest rates (up to 9%), and skyrocketing costs of raw materials, including steel and cement, which accounted for approximately 20% of an average project's cost structure. This had led the contractors to be more selective in managing their costs of contracts because hedging raw materials prices was by no means a sure way to counteract the impacts of high building material prices. Furthermore, a rejection of escalation clauses may in fact have darkened the future of the construction sector. The National Planning and Development Agency (Bappenas) has rejected a project value escalation proposal by the contractors' associations, electrical and mechanical associations and other constructionrelated associations. The sector was then also likely to suffer from postponed infrastructure projects in 2009 as the Public Works Ministry was likely to see its original expenditure plan slashed to Rp 35.6 trillion from Rp 58.7 trillion due to budget constraints amidst higher oil-related subsidies. Diversification into other businesses may help the contractors reduce risks in this context. Some firms have These conflicts were mainly due to political issues and instability with various diverse root causes. These caused various business disruptions, from 1 day to 1 week in the conflict area. As an example in the Jakarta riots, the capital city had a level 1 alert (highest level of national security alert) within the week. People were trapped in their offices, there were no transportation and commercial activities, and there was mass departure from certain ethnic groups going abroad. The government responded to the crises with high level of security and military responses in the area. In addition, after the 1998 Jakarta riots, several contractors had subsequently developed emergency responses to riots/conflicts. \u2022 Fire (PTX 2008; Tadie 2008) Forest fires and short circuits in slums area and buildings mostly occurred in Indonesia's dense cities and villages. In populated cities like Jakarta and Surabaya, any fires due to short circuits in the buildings or houses had led to building evacuation. Considering this, in protecting the firm's head or site office, most of the contractors have emergency responses for fires in their facilities and sites. \u2022 Accidents/safety issues (Permana 2007; PTX 2008) Recently, it has been found that accidents in construction projects are increasing, particularly involving the small contractors. The accident severity rates are increasing from year to year. Impacts from these events included small injuries to fatalities, loss of workforce due to injuries, and loss of productivity. Responding to these, most of the large contractors have developed detailed safety plans and certification. However, only a few small contractors have safety plans in their firms. Indonesia had suffered from many earthquakes and a huge tsunami disaster within these past years. Some recent events included earthquakes in Aceh and Nias (2004), the Yogyakarta area (2006), and West Sumatra (2007 and 2009). Impacts from such natural disasters are severe, such as building and infrastructure damages, injuries and fatalities. The largest fatalities were in the Aceh and Nias earthquake caused by the tsunami disaster that followed after the earthquake. Emergency responses were provided by local authorities, followed by local and international aids in the following days after the disaster. The local and national government also provided temporary shelters, health aid facilities, and surveys of damage around the area. Due to the significant impact towards the business sector, including construction, an earthquake site evacuation procedure had been planned by most of the contractors. These procedures are particularly vital to the firms that have projects or offices in earthquake-prone area. ",
