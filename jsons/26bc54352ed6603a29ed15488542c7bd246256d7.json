SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were a seven-day leading indicator ahead of compiled COVID-19 testing data and led local hospital admissions data by three days. Decisions to implement or relax public health measures and restrictions require timely information on outbreak dynamics in a community.",

As viral shedding can occur before cases are detected, we hypothesize that the time course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge is a leading indicator of outbreak dynamics within a community served by the treatment plant.",

SARS-CoV-2 RNA sludge concentrations were quantitatively compared with data that are commonly used to track the community progression of COVID-19 including hospital admissions (Figure 2A This study uniquely utilized primary sewage sludge instead of raw wastewater for virus RNA measurements. Sewage sludge is comprised of solids that are removed during primary sedimentation steps and typically gravity thickened. As a result, primary sludge has a greater solids content (2 to 5%) than raw wastewater (0.01 to 0.05%). Due to the elevated solids content and the high case load observed during the outbreak (~1,200 per 100,000 population), the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA reported here ranged from two to three orders of magnitude greater than raw wastewater SARS-CoV-2 values previously reported 8, 10, 13 .",

To quantify SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA concentrations in primary sludge, 2.5 mL of well mixed sludge were added directly to a commercial kit optimized for isolation of total RNA from soil (RNeasey PowerSoil Total RNA kit, Qiagen). Isolated RNA pellets were dissolved in 50 \u03bcL of ribonuclease free water and total RNA measured by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop, ThermoFisher Scientific).

Replicated samples demonstrated similar SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration values and comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 primer values with the human ribonuclease P (RP) gene primer values indicate that dynamic temporal concentration changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA were from actual change in virus concentration (Figure 1B). Concentration comparisons produced an average slope of 0.98 \u00b1 0.17 st. dev., while replicates comparing N and RP primer values result in a flat line, with average slope of 0.05 \u00b1 0.05 st. dev.

All three measures traced the initial wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the New Haven metropolitan area. Applying Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) to the data and rescaling enables comparison (Figure 2A,B). The virus RNA time course peaked 3 days earlier than hospital admissions (April 9 versus April 12) and a cross correlation analysis revealed a correlation coefficient (R=0.996) between smoothed RNA and hospital data when the latter was shifted 3 days forward. Comparing the LOWESS-smoothed daily virus RNA and COVID-19 testing data reveals that the peak in COVID-19 cases (April 16) occurred 7 days following the peak in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration (April 9) (Figure 2C). A cross correlation analysis resulted in a maximum correlation coefficient (R=0.994) when the COVID-19 testing data is adjusted 7 days forward. Regressing the adjusted COVID-19 testing data and SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA concentrations yield a value of 1,305 virus RNA copies/mL per new COVID-19 case report as the outbreak ascended (Figure 2D), and 1,240 virus RNA copies/mL per new COVID-19 case report as the outbreak descended (Figure 2E). a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration time course in primary sewage sludge during a COVID-19 outbreak in the New Haven, CT metropolitan area. Approximately 200,000 people are served by the treatment facility and COVID-19 total documented cases by testing rose from less than 29 to 2,609 during the March 19 to May 1, 2020 surveillance period. Our results demonstrate: (1) the utility of SARS-CoV-2 primary sludge monitoring to accurately track outbreaks in a community and (2) primary sludge SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations can be a leading indicator over other commonly used epidemiology approaches including summarized COVID-19 test results and hospital admissions.",

SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations led hospital admissions by 3 days and COVID-19 cases by 7 days. Hospital admissions to Yale New Haven Hospital from the four towns served by the wastewater treatment facility both rose and fell more slowly than the observed RNA concentrations. The rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA increases and decreases were similar to the COVID-19 testing data, and reflect the very concentrated outbreak that took place within New Haven and its neighboring towns. The strong correlation between the virus RNA and COVID-19 case data provides an approach to independently evaluate the local SARS-CoV-2 testing rate and to estimate the number of new cases. While the results here demonstrate the potential utility of such an approach, we note that these relationships could be treatment plant specific, as primary sludge process trains are not uniform, and that compiled COVID-19 testing is prompted by symptoms, thus underestimating the true number of cases.16 In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge were tracked throughout a COVID-19 epidemic and compared with traditional outbreak epidemiological indicators. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in primary sludge closely followed the epidemiology curves established by compiled COVID-19 testing data and hospital admissions, but was a leading indicator by seven and three days, respectively. Our study could have substantial policy implications. Jurisdictions can use primary sludge SARS-CoV-2 concentrations to preempt community outbreak dynamics or provide an additional basis for easing restrictions, especially when there are limitations in clinical testing. Raw wastewater and sludge-based surveillance is particularly useful for low and middle-income countries where clinical testing capacity is limited.",
