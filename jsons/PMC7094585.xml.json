These systems make it possible for people to travel around the world and, at the same time, serve as a network through which an epidemic can spread worldwide. As indicated by recent epidemic outbreaks, such as SARS and H1N1, a disease can very quickly spread to distant locations through this network. Controlling this mode of disease spread is essential.",

            "text": "In order to understand the spatial spreading of an epidemic, researchers have analyzed related mathematical models. For example, Sattenspiel and Dietz [18] investigated the spread of infectious disease among discrete geographical regions with the assumption that people travel between them. Using demographic analysis adapted from [18], Arino and van den Driessche proposed a multi-city SIS epidemic model and found explicit bounds on the basic reproduction number R0\n[2]. Hyman and LaForce modeled the disease spread among multiple cities using a system of deterministic differential equations and analyzed the reproductive number and the sensitivity of the model [12]. Numerical simulation results of the model were also compared with the CDC influenza data. An n-patch SIS model with immigration of susceptible and infective individuals was proposed by Wang and Zhao [22] and a threshold which determines the persistence and extinction of the epidemic was obtained. This model was further investigated by Jin and Wang [13], and Zhang and Zhao [25]; the latter assumes that some coefficients in the model proposed in [22] are periodic with a common period. Recently, Yang et al. [24] studied both SIR and SIS epidemic models with bilinear incidence and migration between two patches (locations). They obtain the basic reproduction numbers, which govern the stabilities of the disease-free equilibrium. These studies investigated the spatial spread of different kinds of diseases among two or more locations.",

We consider a disease spreading between multiple locations (nodes) through a transportation system with a single hub, ignoring any connections between this sub-system and the rest of the global transportation system. Understanding how the epidemic spreads through this sub-system is fundamental to studying the disease spread through the world-wide transportation network. In order to appreciate the effect that the transportation system may have on the epidemic spread, we also ignore any other transportation connections between these locations (nodes) and the hub (in particular, we assume there is no direct connection between any two nodes). Here we consider an SIRS disease model. That is, for each location, the population is divided into susceptibles, infecteds and recovereds. Modifications based on other standard epidemiological factors (e.g. exposed classes) or the effect of specific travel routes can be incorporated into the model, but that lies beyond the scope of the current work.",

Typical epidemics spreading through public transportation are airborne diseases (e.g. SARS and influenza including the H1N1 strain). Such diseases are caused by pathogenic microbial agents spreading through the air. Aerosolized viruses and germs can originate from a patient\u2019s mouth and nose through sneezing, coughing, laughing or speaking [9], [14], [17]. After leaving the human body, these pathogens can remain suspended in the air contained in aerosol particles or tiny droplets, or stay on surfaces for an extended period of time [3], [14], [17]. Recent investigations indicate that the SARS coronavirus can survive on a surface for up to 3 days [4], while influenza A and B viruses are capable of remaining contagious on a surface for up to 48 h [3]. By touching such a surface, even without being close to the infectives, the susceptibles may become infected [3], [4].",

Since there is a limited amount of room and facilities at the hub, the susceptibles have the chance to meet the infectives from any location and/or to any destination.

Using (24), the eigenvalues of VF-1 can be calculated directly. We find that d is an eigenvalue of VF-1 with multiplicity N-1 and the remaining two eigenvalues are also eigenvalues of the 2\u00d72 matrix(26)abNcd.Thus, N-1 of the eigenvalues are equal to \u03bc\u03bc+\u03b3+\u03d5\u03b1\u03b2A and the other two eigenvalues are roots of the quadratic(27)0=\u03bb2-a\u03bb-d\u03bb-Ncb+ad.Using (25), it follows that both roots of (27) are positive reals and that the smaller root \u03bb1 is less than d=\u03bc(\u03bc+\u03b3+\u03d5\u03b1)\u03b2A.

Since the cities are identical, the random walk may be considered to be back and forth between classes I1 and IT. R0 is the expected number of new infections caused by a single infective over the entire course of infectiousness in an otherwise susceptible population [10]. Because \u03b2T is tending to 0,R0 is the product of the number of susceptibles in city 1 at the disease-free equilibrium A\u03bc, the incidence rate at the disease-free equilibrium \u03b2, the average time spent in class I1 per visit 1\u03bc+\u03b3+\u03b1\u03d5 and the expected number K of visits to I1 during the random walk. In order to calculate K, it is necessary to sum a geometric series K=1+q+q2+\u22ef=11-q, where q is the probability of leaving I1 for IT and then returning to I1 again. The quantity q is a product of the probability that individuals leave I1 for IT with the probability that individuals leave IT for I1. These probabilities are calculated by taking the ratio of the required flow rate to the total exit flow rate. Thus q is the product of \u03b1\u03d5\u03bc+\u03b3+\u03b1\u03d5 and p\u03b3T+p.

The effect of the sanitation condition of the public transportation system (i.e. the effect of the contact rate \u03b2T) on the epidemic spread is shown in Fig. 1(b). With improved sanitation, \u03b2T is expected to decrease and so fewer travelers will be infected during the journey, and as such epidemic spread in the three cities is lessened accordingly. The relationship between the rate \u03d5 at which susceptibles choose to travel and the epidemic spreading is illustrated in bifurcation diagram Fig. 1(c), which indicates the potential effectiveness of warning against unnecessary travel at controlling the epidemic.

Installing clinical thermometers at the entrances of the inter-city public transportation systems can then be used to decrease the rate infectives travel (i.e. to decrease \u03b1) either through mandatory travel bans for individuals with a fever or through voluntary actions by infective travelers who self diagnose before entering the inter-city public transportation system. With fewer infectives entering the public transportation system, infection within the system will decrease. As a result, epidemic spread in the cities will decrease accordingly. However, as shown in Fig. 1(d), decreasing \u03b1 by installing clinical thermometers at the entrances of the inter-city public transportation system does not always return the system to a stable disease-free equilibrium, even when the disease would die out in isolated cities. If the sanitary condition of the public transportation system is poor, then viruses will spread quickly within the system due to the high contact rate; that is \u03b2T will be high. Even with decreased \u03b1, the number of infectives in the public transportation system might still be high and the effect of decreasing \u03b1 might not be significant. However, in a cleaner public transportation system, the effect of decreasing \u03b1 is more pronounced in decreasing the spread of the disease. As indicated in Fig. 1(d), for some parametric values related to transportation, the epidemic cannot be totally controlled by letting \u03b1=0. Assume that, from time t0,\u03b1 is reduced to 0. For a transportation system with low p and high \u03b2T, since the infecteds who entered the system before t0 have to spend an extended period of time in the system, they could be still in the system after t0 and as such the susceptibles who entered the system after t0 can still get infected.

For simplicity, we explicitly assume that all individuals in the transit system may interact with each other and so include the transit system as a single additional location where infection may occur. The goal of the study is to investigate the influence that the transportation system (including the time spent in the transit system, the proportions of the susceptibles and the infectives who travel, and the health condition of the transportation system) has on an epidemic outbreak.
