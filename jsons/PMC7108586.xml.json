FRDA is also characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that becomes the main cause of death among the patients (5) and by accumulation of labile iron in patient's mitochondria (6).",

In addition, we hypothesized that GLaz might be an important candidate modulating the frataxin-deficient phenotype. We report that reduction of Drosophila frataxin (fh) expression either ubiquitously or in a pan-glial pattern produced a massive accumulation of FAs. In addition, loss of glial frataxin resulted in shortened lifespan, increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, impaired locomotor activity and progressive vacuolization of glial enriched regions. Interestingly, GLaz was able to significantly counteract some phenotypes detected in frataxin-deficient flies such as shortened lifespan, compromised locomotor performance and reduced aconitase activity. More importantly, this work provides in vivo evidence supporting a central role of lipid peroxides in the pathophysiology of FRDA.",

Invertebrate glia do not generate myelin sheaths; however, they form multi-layered membrane protections around the neurons. To investigate these aspects in a Drosophila model system, expression of fh was downregulated in glial cells by means of the UAS-GAL4 system and the use of the pan-glial Repo-GAL4 driver. This driver was described by Sepp et al. (47) as a glial-specific GAL4 line expressed in all ectodermally derived glia within the PNS and CNS, reproducing the endogenous Repo expression (48).",

(51) carefully studied the influence of distinct plastic embedding media and staining procedures on the lipid morphology in light and electron microscopy and they discovered that the binding affinity of osmium tetroxide varies proportionally with the oxidation status of the FAs. This would suggest that GLaz function has an influence on the nature of the lipids stored in the vesicles and that the oxidation state of these lipids might be altered by the co-expression of GLaz in glial cells.",

We used the da-GAL4 driver because it provides a more widespread expression facilitating the detection of changes in aconitase activity. Loss of frataxin provoked a 28% decrease in aconitase activity in hyperoxia-treated adult flies (Fig. 5C) and 46% in larvae (Fig. 5D).

We also showed that a general reduction of frataxin to levels compatible with a normal development provoked an early overload of lipid peroxides without a detectable rise in the level of FAs. Thus, the increase in lipid peroxides is probably due to a higher ROS production rather than to an FA accumulation. However, we can speculate that the increase of FA mediated by a strong reduction of frataxin expression could exponentially increase the oxidation rate of FAs.",

Moreover, up to 40% of FRDA patients manifest different glucose metabolism problems (53) such as diabetes or insulin resistance, and remarkably type 2 diabetes patients also present an altered lipid status attributable to a mitochondrial dysfunction (54,55). However, the link between increased lipid amounts and FRDA is not completely clear. On the one hand, depletion of frataxin generates different scenarios that can lead to the inhibition of mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation. For example, mitochondrial respiration defects induce a reduction of NAD+/NADH ratios compromising the \u03b2-oxidation pathway (22,56). Alternatively, impairment of aconitase activity increases citrate levels (57), and citrate is an allosteric activator of malonyl-CoA production, which in turn is a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation (reviewed in 58). Furthermore, downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) pathway has been observed in FRDA mice models, suggesting a reduction of lipid catabolism (59). Moreover, on the other hand, frataxin deficiency has been suggested to increase lipogenesis via hyperactivation of mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase (60) or upregulating the expression of the sterol-responsive element-binding protein 1 (Srebp1) (59). Thus, derangement of lipid homeostasis in FRDA could be produced by either blocking the main degradation pathway of FAs or increasing their synthesis. In addition, lipid imbalance could be a critical event in FRDA progression since lipid metabolism is the main fuel source of the cell.",

The link between oxidative stress and frataxin has been extensively analyzed. Indeed, loss of frataxin not only promotes hypersensitivity to oxidative insult in various experimental models (12\u201317), it also induces accumulation of oxidative stress markers such as anion superoxide (62\u201364), carbonylated proteins (16,65) and MDA or other lipoperoxidation products (46,66). Moreover, frataxin overexpression reduces endogenous levels of ROS in cell culture (67) and increases antioxidant activity in Drosophila (68). The age-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides found in our Drosophila model corroborates the endogenous increase in ROS production led by loss of frataxin. Castilho et al. (69,70) reported that lipid peroxides trigger a cascade of events that includes a fall in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial swelling and loss of mitochondrial matrix components. More interestingly, lipid peroxidation is strongly catalyzed through the Fenton reaction by iron and iron complexes (71,72), being the iron\u2013citrate complex one of the most toxic forms. Remarkably, iron is the transition metal that accumulates in frataxin-deficient yeast and in the mitochondria of different samples from FRDA patients (6,11,73). Thus, iron-mediated oxidative insult seems to develop a crucial role in the function of frataxin and in the progression of the disease. Since lipid peroxides are the most harmful oxidative stress mediators, strategies focused on quenching, recycling or protecting such products could be highly beneficial for the treatment of the disease.",

            "text": "The lipid metabolism failure is not restricted to a systemic reduction of frataxin. When fh expression is suppressed in glial cells, an accumulation of FAs was first detected with electron microscopy and confirmed by gas chromatography. Since neuron\u2013glia interactions are crucial to ensure optimal brain function and glia are the principal neuron energy suppliers, our results may indicate a pivotal function of glial cells in the FRDA neuropathology. Indeed, posterior nerve roots and posterior sensory nerves in FRDA patients are characterized by an axonal atrophy as well as by a demyelination process, whereas the fine unmyelinated fibers are well preserved (44,74). Interestingly, Lu et al. (75) have recently reported that frataxin knock-down produced severe effects on Schwann cell cultures compared with DRG and with other neuronal cell lines. However, despite this pathological condition, the role of glial cells in the FRDA etiology has not yet been analyzed in detail. In this work, we report that the reduction of frataxin expression in Drosophila glial cells induces adverse effects such as a hypersensitive response against oxidative insult, a decrease in locomotor performance and shortened lifespan. Moreover, we present the first evidence of nervous system degeneration in an invertebrate model of FRDA. Interestingly, some phenotypes were detected prior to a clear lipid accumulation. Therefore, together with the results from the ubiquitous frataxin interference, we suggest that frataxin depletion in glial cells leads to increased lipid peroxidation that induced mitochondrial injury and dysfunction preceding the lipid accumulation and cell degeneration. Although we have not studied this aspect, alterations in glial cells might also occur in the PNS, contributing to the glial phenotypes described in this work.",

            "text": "If lipid dysregulation is a significant factor for FRDA pathology in Drosophila and lipid peroxides are a primary cause of the symptoms, we might be able to mitigate loss-of-frataxin effects by modulating the lipid content and/or the amount of lipoperoxides. GLaz, one of the Drosophila homologs of human ApoD, is expected to counteract both conditions (39,42,76). In frataxin-deficient flies, GLaz, indeed, exhibited cell-specific effects. First, general co-expression of GLaz specifically reduced the amount of monounsaturated FAs. In agreement with these results, ApoD and its homolog proteins have been shown to regulate systemic lipid homeostasis in mice (77) and Drosophila (78), as well as to control the brain lipid composition in mice (79). Our results would also suggest that oleic acid (C18:1), palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and myristoleic acid (C14:1) are reliable biological ligands of GLaz. These data correlate with the in vitro binding properties described for grasshopper Lazarillo (76). Second, ubiquitous co-expression of GLaz also decreased the level of lipid peroxides in frataxin knocked-down flies. Although levels of lipid peroxidation markers are highly increased in GLaz null mutants (39), it is not yet clear whether GLaz is able to bind lipid peroxidation products or, alternatively, is able to prevent lipid oxidation from occurring. However, all lipocalin family members are thought to bind small hydrophobic molecules due to their common tertiary structure (35) and some lipocalins such as human lcn-1 act directly on peroxidated lipids (80), pointing to a lipid-scavenging mechanism for GLaz. In addition, the plant ApoD ortholog knock-out also showed accumulation of other ROS (40). Third, restoration of lipid peroxides and other free radicals to normal levels by Glaz overexpression in frataxin-deficient flies appeared to be sufficient to prevent mitochondrial aconitase inactivation. Similarly, ectopic expression of hydrogen peroxide scavengers such as mitochondrial catalase or mitochondrial peroxiredoxin was able to extend lifespan of flies with reduced frataxin in the PNS. In addition, aconitase activity was restored using mitochondrial catalase in this Drosophila model of FRDA (17). Aconitase activity has also been rescued using the antioxidant compound idebenone in heart homogenates from FRDA patients (66) and by means of iron quelator molecules such as deferiprone (81) and mitochondrial ferritin (82) in frataxin-silenced mammalian cell cultures. These results would indicate that loss of aconitase activity in frataxin-deficient conditions is basically due to an imbalanced redox status in the cell and would suggest a role for frataxin in oxidative stress control. Some authors have proposed that frataxin carries out such tasks through a ferroxidase activity that detoxifies mitochondrial iron and prevents oxidative damage (83,84) or by acting as an iron sensor to negatively regulate the synthesis of Fe\u2013S clusters (85), preventing the generation of oxidative damage from iron deposits and/or misfolded Fe\u2013S clusters. Whereas, others have linked frataxin deficiency with impaired recruitment of antioxidant defenses (86\u201388).",

Human ApoD has been found to be highly upregulated in many neurological diseases or after nervous tissue damage (reviewed in 34,89); however, little is known about its abilities as a neuroprotective molecule. Beneficial effects of exogenous human ApoD have been reported after the induction of encephalitis in mice (90) and cytotoxic injury in hippocampal rat cultures (91). In both cases, the proposed mechanism implies the disposal of lipid peroxides and regulation of inflammatory responses. Remarkably, frataxin deficiency in Schwann cell cultures also triggered the upregulation of inflammatory genes (75). Therefore, we propose that, in our FRDA model, GLaz mainly exerts its protective function by ROS scavenging via quenching lipid peroxides.",

We suggest that lack of frataxin alters the efficient production of these clusters. This dysregulation triggers a cascade of oxidative stress via iron-toxic precipitates, lipid peroxidation and H2O2 overproduction, that quickly would start to inactivate mitochondrial aconitase. This hypothesis would explain why antioxidant proteins are able to restore aconitase activity. However, reactivation of aconitase activity via mitochondrial catalase (17) or GLaz (this work) was not sufficient to bypass pre-adult lethality. This clearly indicates that other elements (for example, respiratory chain complexes) and/or other processes (namely, Fe\u2013S production) are also affected and could not be rescued by these antioxidant mechanisms.",

The stocks were routinely maintained on cornmeal agar medium at 25\u00b0C. The crosses of the GAL4 driver with the UAS responder lines were carried out at 25\u00b0C. UAS constructs were used in heterozygous configuration for all experiments. The lines UDIR1 (49) and UAS-fhIR (15) have been renamed in the text and figures as fhRNAi-1 and fhRNAi-2, respectively. fhRNAi-1 induced a strong interference with a 90% reduction of frataxin expression, whereas fhRNAi-2 produced a moderate 70% reduction compatible with a normal development. Rescue experiments were carried out first generating the stocks UAS-GLaz/CyO;fhRNAi-1/TM3 and fhRNAi-2 UAS-GLaz/CyO (in both lines, the presence of each construct was confirmed by PCR). UAS-Stinger/CyO;fhRNAi-1/TM3 was also created and used as control. A recent issue concerning the targeted gene silencing in Drosophila is the influence of off-target genes on the described phenotypes (92). Regarding FRDA fly models, the similar defects induced by both RNAi lines (fhRNAi-1 and fhRNAi-2) and the observed rescues with fh overexpression (data not shown) virtually excludes the possibility of a false-positive result.",
