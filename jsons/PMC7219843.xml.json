Prenatal care at our institution is performed in outpatient clinics located in the Texas Children's Hospital Pavilion for Women, a maternal level of care 4 facility that had 6,500 deliveries in 2019. Strategic planning was begun with representatives from physician and nursing leadership, hospital administration, and the operational-hospital logistic team. In addition to the modification of the spacing of prenatal visits and an increase in the capacity of our current telemedicine capability, a proposal for drive-through prenatal visits was investigated. Within 7 days, a drive-through model was established. First, potential physical locations for drive-through prenatal care were explored. An existing emergency department ambulance drive-through bay was identified as an optimal location owing to easy access for automobile traffic, patient privacy, low noise level, available electrical power outlets, internet access for mobile computers with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2013compliant electronic medical record, and protection from the elements. Space was available for a temporary tent with air-conditioning capability if necessary for staff. Clinic schedules were designed to allow automobiles to arrive at 10-minute intervals, with up to three automobiles being in the queue at once. Staffing would be provided by one obstetric health care professional and one medical assistant with planned direct patient contact and one registered nurse and one ambulatory service representative for care coordination, order entry, and appointment scheduling. A workflow algorithm was created (Fig. 1). Twenty-four hours before patients\u2019 scheduled appointments, they would be screened for symptoms of COVID-19 infection, with verbal consent obtained for testing and treatment if not obtained previously. Patients would be asked to arrive suitably dressed to allow easy access to their abdomens for physical examination. On arrival for their appointments, patients would be screened for potential of COVID-19 infection by telephone. Asymptomatic patients who screen positive at that time would have a nasopharyngeal swab performed by an appropriately protected team member and asked to self-quarantine until the result was available. Symptomatic patients with symptoms suggesting requirement for admission would be directed to park their automobiles and then escorted to a testing location within the hospital and examined to determine need for admission.6",

A medical assistant and a health care professional (each wearing a surgical mask and using gloves) would approach the patient, who would stay in the car. Maternal temperature and blood pressure and fetal heart tones would be measured. If deemed necessary, a handheld ultrasound probe connected to a smart phone could be used to evaluate fetal heart tones, maximum vertical pocket of amniotic fluid, or fetal presentation. Common questions asked during routine prenatal visits would be addressed (eg, presence of fetal movement, signs and symptoms of preeclampsia, contractions, loss of amniotic fluid). A mobile workstation on wheels with a laptop would be available to document the encounter in the electronic prenatal medical record. Care coordination, referrals, orders, and follow-up appointments would be performed by the registered nurse and ambulatory service representative in an adjacent service bay to minimize face-to-face contact. The patient would then drive out of the visit (Fig. 1). To expedite the model development, the plan was to not perform phlebotomy service to streamline times and supplies used in the drive-through visit, nor to administer immunizations owing to the requirement for refrigeration to store vaccines. If any situation were encountered (such as elevated maternal blood pressure) that required further evaluation, the patient would be directed to park her vehicle and she would be escorted to the clinic or to the obstetric triage center for further evaluation.",

Approaches to limiting the number of person-to-person prenatal visits and increasing the use of telehealth methodology have been suggested.2,3 By offering drive-through visits that include key elements that some institutions cannot perform by telehealth encounters, including blood pressure measurements for evaluation for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, fetal heart rate assessment, and selected ultrasound-based measurements or observations, as well as face-to-face patient\u2013health care professional interaction, we may be able to reduce patient anxiety resulting from the reduction in the number of their planned clinic visits with an obstetric health care professional as well as fear of virus exposure in the clinic setting. Although one could have patients monitor their own blood pressure and fetal heart rate at home, supplies for home monitoring resources and ability to perform these procedures accurately may be limited, thus diminishing the feasibility of acquiring reliable home measurements.",

This will decrease contact with hospital personnel and minimize fomite-mediated virus transmission. Even with the implementation of pre\u2013clinic visit COVID-19 screening methods, an asymptomatic individual who later tests positive for COVID-19 infection can enter a facility and inadvertently expose other individuals.9 Another potential benefit of this model is a reduction in the amount of personal protective equipment used in a clinic environment in institutions employing universal surgical mask use for both the health care professional and the patient during face-to-face interactions. In the drive-through prenatal care visits, the health care professional and medical assistant would be the only staff members wearing surgical masks and gloves. Patients would not be provided surgical masks because they are not entering the facility; however, it is recommended that patients wear cloth face coverings as suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.10",

Additionally, not all institutions will have the physical layout to allow this concept to be operationalized. However, temporary structures, such as an outdoor commercial tent in a parking area, could be used. The generalizability (external validity) of our project may be restricted to a very specific population of health care professionals and patients. However, our model requires minimal additional resources that are typically available in most obstetric clinics across the United States, and it can be implemented in a very short period of time.",
