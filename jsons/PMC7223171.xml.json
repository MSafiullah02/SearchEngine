Stress initiates a cascade of pathways in the peripheral and central nervous systems that activates the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and/or the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to maintain homeostasis [2]. Cognitive and emotional feedbacks from the cortical and limbic areas of the brain modulate the activity of hypothalamic and brain stem structures directly controlling ANS and HPA activity [2, 3]. Fatigue is an adaptive response to acute stress that conserves energy and maintains homeostasis [3]. With repeated stressful events or cumulative exposure to stressful life events (SLEs), the ANS and HPA experience increased allostatic load resulting in increased fatigue severity [4].",

Using clinically meaningful cutoff scores for the Lee Fatigue Scale (i.e., 3.2 for morning and 5.6 for evening), we labeled the four distinct morning (i.e., Very Low, Low, High, and Very High) [6] and four distinct evening (i.e., Low, Moderate, High, and Very High) [7] fatigue profiles derived using latent profile analysis (LPA; see Supplemental Figure 1).",

            "text": "Coping encompasses a broad range of cognitive and behavioral responses to stress to maintain homeostasis [16]. Patients can use multiple coping strategies based on their appraisal of the internal (e.g., acceptance) and external (e.g., social support systems) resources available to them to reduce, master, or tolerate stress [16]. In addition, lifetime exposure to stressful experiences (e.g., physical or sexual assault) and current life stressors (e.g., cancer diagnosis and treatment) influence coping [16]. Coping is often described in terms of the use of engagement (e.g., actively doing something to alter the stressor) or disengagement (e.g., avoidance) strategies [16\u201318]. In the four studies that examined the association between coping and fatigue during CTX, greater fatigue severity was associated with disengagement coping [19, 20], while lower fatigue severity was associated with engagement coping [21, 22], However, these studies did not examine the impact of cumulative exposure to SLEs on coping and fatigue. One study found that increased exposure to SLEs was associated with greater fatigue severity in women with breast cancer; however, the effects of coping were not evaluated [23]. Given the paucity of research on the relationships between stress and coping and fatigue, the purpose of this study was to evaluate for differences in cumulative exposure to SLEs, general stress, cancer-specific stress, and coping strategies among our previously identified morning [6] and evening [7] fatigue classes.",

Using separate LFS questionnaires, patients rated each item based on how they felt within 30 min of awakening (i.e., morning fatigue) and prior to going to bed (i.e., evening fatigue). The LFS has established cutoff scores for clinically meaningful levels of fatigue (i.e., \u2265 3.2 for morning fatigue, \u2265 5.6 for evening fatigue) [26]. The LFS has well-established validity and reliability and is easy to administer [25]. In our study, Cronbach\u2019s alphas were 0.96 for morning and 0.93 for evening fatigue.",

While previous research found associations between childhood SLEs and increased risk for greater fatigue severity in women with breast cancer [8], our study is the first to evaluate the impact of SLEs on fatigue severity in a sample of patients with heterogeneous cancer diagnoses. Compared with the other three classes, patients in both the Very High morning and evening fatigue classes reported higher numbers of and higher impact from previous SLEs. The increased allostatic load associated with cumulative SLEs [4] is a plausible explanation for these associations. For example, higher levels of and higher impact from SLEs increased the risk of experiencing chronic pain [33], as well as fatigue and depression [34]. These findings suggest that SLEs in oncology patients may be associated with increased risk for multiple co-occurring symptoms and warrant further study.",

The IES-R total score for patients in the Very High morning fatigue class (i.e., 29.9) meets the criterion for subsyndromal PTSD [30]. This finding is consistent with previous reports of greater fatigue severity being associated with higher IES-R total scores in patients with Cushing\u2019s disease [38] and survivors of Middle East respiratory syndrome [39]. While the patients in the Very High evening fatigue class had IES-R total scores below the clinically meaningful cutoff for subsyndromal PTSD (i.e., IES-R total score of 21.7), their scores were significantly higher than those of the other three evening fatigue classes, which suggests that cancer-specific stress is a risk factor for greater evening fatigue severity. Given the negative impact of fatigue on oncology patients receiving CTX [40], the higher scores on the avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal subscales of the IES-R are not unexpected. Our findings suggest that interventions to decrease cancer-specific stress (e.g., yoga [41]) may decrease fatigue severity.",

The religion subscale of the Brief Cope assesses several of these overlapping constructs (e.g., using prayer or meditation) [31]. In oncology patients, spiritual well-being was associated with lower fatigue severity [54]. However, religious/spiritual coping support is not a consistent part of patient care [53]. Assessing patients\u2019 interest in the use of religious/spiritual coping strategies and providing support for these strategies may assist with fatigue management. Further research on the association between fatigue and religious/spiritual coping strategies is warranted.",

Because the LSC-R is a retrospective evaluation, it is possible that the patients\u2019 current symptom experiences or cancer diagnosis and treatment influenced their memories of past events. While the subjective measures of stress are valid and reliable, future studies should examine associations between the severity of morning and evening fatigue and objective measures of stress (e.g., hair cortisol) as well as inflammatory genes and their expression and regulation. In addition, future studies should examine the extreme fatigue classes (i.e., Very Low morning versus Low evening, and Very High morning versus Very High evening) for differences in stress and coping strategies.",
