            "text": "Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) complex, colloquially referred to as kennel cough, is a contagious disease in dogs, particularly prolific in rehoming centers and kennels. Dogs suffer from a dry hacking cough, which is usually cleared in 1\u20133 weeks, however, severe bronchopneumonia can develop (Appel, 1987). CIRD is a multifactorial disease with identified disease agents including canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) (Appel and Percy, 1970), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) (Ditchfield et al., 1962), canine pneumovirus (Mitchell et al., 2013), and the bacteria Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bemis, 1992) and Mycobacterium cynos (Mitchell et al., 2017). More recently, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) was also identified as a causative agent of CIRD. This virus was first identified in the UK in a rehoming center with a high incidence of CIRD (Erles et al., 2003), however, a retrospective study has suggested that it may have circulated as early as 1996 in Canada (Ellis et al., 2005). Additional surveys have identified antibodies in dogs in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Japan, and the US, with antibody prevalence as high as 87.7% in the state of Kentucky, USA (An et al., 2010b; Decaro et al., 2007; Erles and Brownlie, 2005; Knesl et al., 2009; Priestnall et al., 2006, Priestnall et al., 2007; Schulz et al., 2014). A small number of isolates have also been sequenced and characterized (An et al., 2010a; Erles et al., 2003, Erles et al., 2007; Jeoung et al., 2014; Yachi and Mochizuki, 2006).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses cause numerous diseases, including upper and lower respiratory diseases, gastroenteritis, and central nervous system infections in a number of avian and mammalian species. In humans, coronavirus infections range from the common cold (e.g. HCoV-OC83) to more severe zoonotic diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Peiris et al., 2003; van der Hoek et al., 2004) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (Cunha and Opal, 2014; de Groot et al., 2013). Coronaviruses have large zoonotic potential, and the ability to cross species boundaries lies in not only mutation, but also the propensity for these viruses to recombine, with important breakpoints identified around the spike (S) gene in both birds and mammals (Vijaykrishna et al., 2007; Woo et al., 2009). Extensive homologous and heterologous recombination events have been documented in both human and animal group 2 coronaviruses leading to the generation of various genotypes and strains (Woo et al., 2009). CRCoV is a group 2 coronavirus, or betacoronavirus, which are comprised of mammalian coronaviruses. The most closely related species to CRCoV is bovine coronavirus (BCoV), with many closely related species or strains such as Sambar deer coronavirus, Waterbuck coronavirus and human enteric coronavirus (HEC 4408), illustrating the proliferation of these BCoV-like viruses.",

Furthermore, we aimed to understand the introduction of these viruses into Sweden by using time-structured phylogeny and recombination analysis.

Specifically, we used the algorithms RDP (Martin and Rybicki, 2000) and BOOTSCAN (Martin et al., 2005) to detect the recombination window, and used additional algorithms within RPD4 to cross reference support for the detected window.",

Indeed, all samples for all genes were within 99% identity (Fig. A3). Phylogenetic reconstruction of the larger genes (S, HE and M) indicates that Swedish viruses are most closely related to a CRCoV isolated in Italy in 2005 (EU999954), and in some trees CRCoV isolated in the UK in 2003 (DQ682406) (Fig. A4). Given discordance between trees, we constructed a consensus tree from a concatenated alignment using Splitstree, suggesting that all Swedish viruses are likely the result of a single introduction and despite recombination being a common feature in CRCoV's, are most similar to the two aforementioned viruses (Figs. 4, A4). Time-structured phylogenetic analysis of the S gene suggests that the most recent common ancestor of all Swedish CRCoVs was introduced to Sweden at the beginning of 2010 [2010.152 with a confidence interval ranging from 2004.035 to 2012.697], with subsequence proliferation within Sweden (Fig. 2\n). As suggested with previous analysis, the viruses isolated in Sweden are most closely related to an isolate from Italy, but not necessarily the UK, and that CRCoVs found in Europe may have emerged and been introduced from Asia. However, due to the sparseness of sequences, we have not undertaken phylogeographic analysis, and these observations should be interpreted with caution.",

This lineage separation is most evident in the S tree (Fig. A4C), where all CRCoVs form a clade that is different from BCoV. However, CRCoV does not always fall into a distinctive clade; some genes like the HE and M of some isolates are more closely related to BCoV sequences than CRCoV. This was not the case with the viruses from Sweden, which are very similar to each other, and more distantly related to BCoV than other CRCoV sequences (Fig. S2A, Fig. 3\n). When assessing pairwise identity, it is clear that the percentage identity of all global CRCoVs only (Fig. A3B) and a combination of all CRCoV and BCoV sequences (Fig. A3C) for the partial NS, HE and the complete M gene is rather similar. This is in contrast to the S gene, where percentage identity of all CRCoVs ranges from 99 to 100% whereas when including BCoV outgroups the range is from 97.5 to 99%. This is because for many genes, viruses from Korea (K9, K37, K39) and a recent sequence from China which were mined from GenBank are more similar to BCoV than to CRCoVs detected in Europe (Fig. 4A). Recombination detection algorithms detect that there is indeed a recombination event in these previously described Korean and Chinese viruses, where the NS, HE, E and M sequence is more similar to BCoV than to other CRCoV sequences (Region probability with MC correction: 0.002691556) (Table A3). The breakpoint, represented by the end of the HE gene and start of the S gene, has a high probability (0.008164); however, the certainty of the breakpoint at the end of the S gene is undetermined due to a number of potential breakpoints (Fig. A5), which is revealed in the BOOTSCAN analysis. This is because all CRCoVs, but especially the Asian CRCoVs, have higher signal for BCoV at the end of the S gene (Fig. 4B). Whether this is due to recombination within the S gene, or due to evolutionary processes of conservation in this section of the S gene, is unclear given some similarity between Swedish CRCoV and BCoV in this region as well. Regardless, these recombinant isolates have been maintained in Asia, demonstrated by the isolation of a virus in China in 2014 sharing the same mosaic CRCoV-BCoV pattern as viruses isolated in Korea in 2008. Overall, viruses sequenced in Sweden as part of this study have a different recombination profile as compared to previously described viruses from China and Korea.",

Furthermore, regardless of method, most of the SNVs observed were at a frequency lower than 0.1. There was variation in SNV's across samples. There were no variants identified in CRCoV5 with either method. In contrast, CRCoV10 contained 17 different SNV's. CRCoV7 and CRCoV12 had marked different pattern depending on method used, whereby SNV's were identified with ShoRAH but not with QuasiRecomb due to differences in detection of indels. There are no positions of SNVs that are common to all samples. Only one SNV was common to CRCoV3 and CRCoV9 (position 2807).

CIRD is a major cause of morbidity in dogs and an important animal welfare condition. This disease is multi-factorial, and a recent European survey reported that CRCoV, canine pneumovirus and the bacteria Mycoplasma cynos, besides the previously established main causes (mainly CPIV and B. bronchiseptica), all played a role in the disease (Mitchell et al., 2017). To date, the highest prevalence of CRCoV remains in rehoming centers (Erles and Brownlie, 2005; Erles et al., 2003; Mitchell et al., 2017), or other instances where dogs may be cohoused, such as in racing greyhounds (Sowman et al., 2018). Epidemiology is unclear in pet dogs, such as those sampled in our study, but we predict that occasions where many dogs meet (e.g. dog day-care centers, dog shows and other activities), are likely contributing to spread, similarly to other CIRD-causing pathogens. Overall, we found that 13% of pet dogs with signs of CIRD in Sweden, ranging from mild (cough only) to severe (affected general condition and deep coughing) disease signs, were positive for CRCoV, demonstrating the role that this virus plays in the complex aetiology of CIRD. Importantly, we found CRCoV in dogs of all breeds, ages, and sexes demonstrating that this virus affects all dogs, equally. CRCoV was isolated between December and March; no viruses were detected in the summer months. This lack of significance of season was likely due to few tests being undertaken in the summer, resulting in a large uncertainty.",

This has allowed for interspecies variability, interspecies host jumps and novel coronaviruses to emerge under the \u201cright\u201d conditions (Decaro et al., 2009; Pyrc et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2015; Su et al., 2016; Woo et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2015). Lineage A of betacoronaviruses is comprised of a number of closely related viruses including CRCoV, BCoV, BCoV-like, and HCoV-OC43. A study by Kin et al., 2016 demonstrated that BCoV and HCoV-OC43 have >96% global nucleotide identity and they reported in an earlier study that HCoV-OC43 may be the result of a zoonotic transmission between bovines and humans (Kin et al., 2016; Kin et al., 2015). Furthermore, there is a 97.3% global nucleotide similarity between CRCoV and BCoV (Erles et al., 2003), but more importantly, cross-reactivity between BCoV antigen with CRCoV antibodies (Erles et al., 2003), and infectivity of puppies with BCoV (Kaneshima et al., 2007; Priestnall et al., 2006). Finally, BCoV and CRCoV (and HCoV-OC43) use sialic acids or heparan sulphate to attach to the cell surface, and use the same molecule as entry receptors (HLA-I, Szczepanski et al., 2019). Overall, this provides a lot of evidence for a very putative host switch event. Our splitstree and recombination analyses of global viruses support the results in Lu et al., which demonstrate high levels of recombination between BCoV and previously described CRCoV strains, including those from UK, Italy, Korea and China (Lu et al., 2017).",

Viruses from Sweden were most closely related to a sequenced strain from Italy in 2005, and therefore the most parsimonious conclusion is that these viruses were introduced to Sweden from elsewhere in Europe. Despite being detected in a large number of dog species, large geographic area and across 3 years, there was very little genetic variation in CRCoV from Sweden \u2013 very little genetic drift, few SNVs and no evidence of recombination, suggesting a single, recent introduction, and subsequent spread. Potentially the most interesting finding, is that the CRCoV circulating in Sweden is the most genetically distant virus to BCoV as compared to CRCoV previously described (particularly those from Asia), with the majority of genes clustering into a \u201cCRCoV clade\u201d rather than BCoV, and most genes being <98% similar to BCoV. Whether this suggests better adaptation to dogs with time, or whether it represents geographical differences, is unclear, and will be revealed with further sequencing of these viruses, globally.",

To date, commercial vaccines are only available for the well-established CIRD pathogens CPIV, CAV-2 and B. bronchiseptica. Despite frequent vaccinations in dogs, CIRD remains a burden for dogs and dog-owners, and as such, it is imperative to better understand the epidemiology and evolution to prevent virus introductions and spread, and to provide informed advice on quarantine decisions related to dog housing facilities, ranging from dog day-care centers to show dogs and racing kennels.",
