            "text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting millions of individuals worldwide, making it one of the most common monogenetic diseases. Sickle cell anemia, the most common and severe form of SCD, occurs in patients with a single amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for valine in the \u03b2-globin gene, resulting in an abnormal hemoglobin form called hemoglobin S (HbS) within the erythrocytes. Mutant HbS has reduced solubility when deoxygenated compared to normal hemoglobin A (HbA), leading to polymerization and aggregation of sickle erythrocytes in the microvasculature. Structural abnormalities and cumulative damage to the cellular membrane of sickled erythrocytes results in hemolysis and the development of chronic hemolytic anemia, as well as vaso-occlusion and multiorgan pathology. Compound heterozygosity of HbS with other \u03b2-globin gene mutations results in additional types of SCD, such as hemoglobin SC or hemoglobin S-\u03b2-thalassemia [ 1 ] . Despite signifi cant improvements in the life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease, estimates of the median age at death range from 42 to 53 years for men and 48 to 58.5 years for women [ 2 , 3 ] .",

Deoxygenated HbS polymerizes and aggregates inside erythrocytes, forming rigid, sickled cells. The abundance of polymerized HbS is strongly infl uenced by both the level of deoxygenation and the concentration of intracellular HbS [ 4 ] , and determines the severity of SCD [ 5 ] . Pathologic sickled erythrocytes have increased adherence to the vascular endothelium, leading to microvasculature occlusion and subsequent multiorgan damage. Vaso-occlusion often manifests as episodic pain crises in SCD patients , a disease hallmark, as well as a high frequency of acute chest syndrome (ACS) [ 2 , 6 ] . Due to chronically low Hb levels in SCD, patients rely on an overproduction of erythrocytes. Acute splenic sequestration and infectious and infl ammatory processes, such as ACS, can interfere with erythropoiesis and trigger reticulocytopenia, or \"aplastic crisis\" in patients.",

The National Acute Chest Syndrome Study Group analyzed 671 episodes of ACS in 538 patients with SCD to determine the cause, outcome, and response to therapy [ 6 ] . Respiratory samples obtained from sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage :19020327] ). The acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease is a lung injury syndrome known to be initiated by three major mechanisms, including infection, bone marrow and/or fat embolization, and direct pulmonary microvascular infarction due to red blood cell sequestration. The mechanisms lead to vaso-occlusion by sickle cells with resulting infarction and lung injury. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia due to lung injury leads to increased deoxygenation and polymerization of hemoglobin S, and erythrocyte vaso-occlusion. This pathologic mechanism promotes bone marrow infarction and pulmonary vaso-occlusion. NO nitric oxide; VCAM-1 vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 were analyzed for viral and bacterial infections. A specifi c pathogen could not be identifi ed in the majority of cases, however numerous different pathogens were identifi ed, including Chlamydia pneumoniae (29 % of patients), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (20 %), and respiratory syncytial virus (10 %).

Overall mortality is 3 % in all ACS patients and 9 % in adults [ 6 ] . ACS therefore requires rapid management to prevent clinical decompensation and death. Recent increased awareness, the chronic use of hydroxyurea, and the aggressive use of early transfusion therapy, collectively, have led to a decrease in ACS-related mortality [ 42 ] .

A CSSCD study in 291 African American children with HbSS followed beyond age 5 years found that asthma was signifi cantly associated with more frequent ACS episodes (0.39 vs. 0.20 events per patient-year) and painful episodes (1.39 vs. 0.47 events per patient-year) [ 43 ] . Other clinical events that increase the risk of ACS include major surgical procedures, hypoxemia, a vascular necrosis of the hips, acute rib infarcts, pregnancy, use of narcotics, acute anemic events (aplastic crises), and previous pulmonary events [ 28 , 36 ] . Active cigarette smoking or environmental smoke exposure are associated with more than twice the rate of ACS episodes, though no dose effect has been determined [ 44 ] . Signifi cantly higher rates of ACS have also been reported following infl uenza infection [ 30 , 31 ] and in winter months [ 36 ] , fi ndings most evident in children but present in all age groups. Several laboratory parameters are associated with the development of ACS. Rates of ACS are positively correlated with non-vaso-occlusive crisis, steady-state white blood cell counts and Hb concentration and inversely correlated with fetal Hb (HbF) levels [ 28 ] . Though higher steady-state Hb levels are associated with ACS, during acute hospitalization for vaso-occlusive crisis, the development of ACS is often preceded by an abrupt drop in Hb levels (mean decrease of 0.78 g/dL from steadystate levels) and increases in markers of hemolysis, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [ 6 , 27 ] . A drop in platelet count also has been shown to precede ACS, with levels <200,000 cells/mm 3 , and is an independent predictor of neurologic complications during hospitalization and need for mechanical ventilation [ 6 , 45 ] . Understanding the epidemiology and complex etiologies of ACS in SCD, which differ among age groups, is critically important to diagnosing and treating this devastating disease manifestation.",

Abdominal, limb, rib, or sternal pain is also common, along with intercostal retractions, nasal fl aring, the use of accessory muscles for Other reason s included a vaso-occlusive event, anemia, fever, infection, gastrointestinal or abdominal pain, asthma, urologic and orthopedic conditions, heart failure, and surgery respiration, and decreased SpO2 (>2 % from steady-state). The clinical presentation, epidemiology, risks, and outcomes of ACS are variable, and the syndrome can often be diagnosed as pneumonia due to the number of shared features. Many of the clinical features of ACS are also age-dependent, refl ecting differences in etiology among age groups, with adults having more causative fat embolization and children with a higher proportion of infectious causes and reactive airway disease. The diagnosis of ACS in SCD patients requires a high index of suspicion, and there are a number of recommended diagnostic approaches. Since the development of ACS often occurs 24-72 h after the onset of severe vaso-occlusive pain symptoms, it is critical that vigilance be kept during hospitalization of SCD patients , as they may be in the prodromal stages of ACS [ 25 ] . A thorough history and physical exam is required for all patients with SCD who present clinically with suspected signs of ACS, along with assessment of vital signs including oxygen saturation. Respiratory rate, pulse rate, and body temperature values have been shown to be higher in children than adults with ACS [ 36 ] . Patients with evidence of oxygen desaturation should have arterial blood gas measurements obtained to confi rm the hypoxia [ 46 ] , since pulse oximetry can be inaccurate in the presence of signifi cant anemia. It is important to note that hypoventilation due to pain crisis or over-sedation can contribute to hypoxemia and exacerbation of ACS.",

Signs and symptoms of vaso-occlusive pain crisis and evidence of new pulmonary radiographic densities can assist in ruling out pulmonary embolus. Testing for D-dimers is unhelpful in SCD patients due to basally elevated levels [ 55 ] . ACS symptoms along with the detection of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities by ultrasound imaging, recent surgery, or extended periods of immobility suggest the presence of pulmonary emboli. Acute coronary syndrome due to the rupture and dislodging of an atherosclerotic plaque within a coronary artery should also be considered with ACS symptom presentation, though coronary artery disease is uncommon in SCD [ 56 ] . Depending on clinical suspicion and patient history, electrocardiography and serum troponin levels can also be measured to evaluate for myocardial damage, since acute multiorgan failure may be present when vaso-occlusive pain crisis and myocardial damage are both present.",

The oxygenation benefi ts of transfusion are due to a left-shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves, which is usually right-shifted at baseline in SCD due to the presence of HbS. Sickle-negative, leukocyte-depleted packed RBCs with extensive matching to Rhesus D, C, and E, as well as Kell antigens should be used for transfusion [ 58 ] . Since SCD patients often receive transfusions for many acute and chronic complications throughout the course of their disease, there is a risk for iron overload and alloimmunization. Therefore even with the use of antigen-matched and cross matchcompatible blood, transfusions may pose a risk to patients with ACS.",

Simple RBC transfusion decreases the concentration of HbS by dilution, and should be considered in more stable patients with single-lobe involvement, mild hypoxemia responsive to low-fl ow oxygen, and worsening anemia [ 58 ] . Exchange transfusion performed by automated erythrocytapheresis can rapidly reduce the percentage of HbS without the risks of iron overload or hyperviscosity, but the risk of alloimmunization remains.

Importantly, hydroxyurea also signifi cantly reduces the need for transfusion therapy and has been demonstrated to reduce overall mortality by 40 % in SCD. The benefi cial mechanisms of hydroxyurea include increasing the number of RBCs containing high levels of HbF, (via stimulation of soluble guanylatecyclase and killing of cycling cells through inhibition of ribonucleotidereductase), as well as decreasing RBC membrane damage, sickling and vaso-occlusion [ 62 ] (Fig. 4.3 ) . These factors can result in a significant reduction in ischemia, necrosis, hemolysis, and vascular damage. Given the known teratogenic effects of hydroxyurea, patients should not be treated during pregnancy or breast-feeding, and contraception should be used in patients receiving therapy. Before initiation of hydroxyurea therapy, baseline measures of complete blood counts, hepatic function, and renal function should be established to determine appropriate dosing.

In addition to the described acute care strategies for ACS, several preventative measures may be employed in these patients. Hydroxyurea therapy is recommended for adult SCD patients with a history of ACS or frequent vaso-occlusive pain episodes, unless otherwise contraindicated, as described above [ 62 ] . In patients with multiple moderate to severe ACS episodes despite maximal hydroxyurea therapy, the use of chronic transfusion therapy to maintain a low percentage of RBCs containing HbS has been shown to decrease the rate of ACS and vaso-occlusive pain crises in SCD [ 63 ] . Careful risk-benefi t assessments must be made in patients considered for chronic transfusion given the association of this therapy with a wide variety of adverse reactions. Myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation, currently the only cure for SCD , may be recommended for patients with severe symptoms that are unresponsive to hydroxyurea therapy or have a history of ACS and have a HLA-matched sibling available as a donor [ 64 ] . Despite the potentially curative outcome of transplantation RBCs produced in the bone marrow are derived from mature precursor cells and contain mostly HbS. Deoxygenation conditions induce HbS polymerization and morphological sickling of RBCs within the circulation, leading to pathologic vaso-occlusion and acute chest syndrome. HbS damages the RBC membrane through several mechanisms resulting in hemolysis, depletion of nitric oxide, and increased adherence to and damage of vascular cells. Hydroxyurea therapy induces \u03b3-globin gene expression and can kill cycling cells, forcing more RBCs called F-cells to be produced, which are derived directly from primitive progenitor cells and contain high fetal hemoglobin (HbF) content. This can reduce pathologic RBC membrane damage, vaso-occlusion, in SCD, there is an associated risk of mortality of 7-10 % and relatively few studies done to address patient selection and criteria for transplant. The use of alternative donor sources and non-myeloablative transplant regimens are currently under investigation, but their utility in ACS remains uncertain.",

            "text": "In a large study conducted by the National Acute Chest Syndrome Study Group , the mean hospital stay for all ACS patients was found to be 10.5 days (12.8 days in adults), and that prolonged hospitalization was independently associated with an age of 20 years or more, a history of vaso-occlusive events, a platelet count of <200,000 cells/mm 3 at diagnosis, pain in the arms and legs at presentation, extensive radiographic abnormalities, evidence of effusion on chest radiography, fever, transfusion therapy, and evidence of respiratory failure [ 6 ] . Of the 3 % of patients that died from ACS in this study, the most common causes of death were pulmonary emboli and infectious bronchopneumonia. Older patients were more likely to have complications and die during hospitalization for ACS, and respiratory failure, defi ned by the need for mechanical ventilation, occurred in 13 % of patients. The development of neurological events, including altered mental status, seizures, and neuromuscular abnormalities, occurred in 11 % of ACS patients, and 46 % of these patients had respiratory failure. Of the subset of patients with neurological complications and respiratory failure, 92 % received transfusion therapy and 23 % died [ 6 ] . Together, these fi ndings highlight the signifi cant sequelae associated with ACS, which contribute to poor patient outcomes. Hydroxyurea also produces nitric oxide, which may help to regulate vascular tone, and directly stimulates HbF production. Overall, hydroxyurea therapy leads to fewer symptoms in patients, less severe hemolytic anemia, fewer cases of acute chest syndrome, and lower mortality Conclusion ACS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults and children with SCD and is associated with a multitude of multiorgan complications. The burden of this condition is likely to become more prevalent as the life expectancy of these patients continues to improve. A high index of suspicion is required to correctly diagnose",
