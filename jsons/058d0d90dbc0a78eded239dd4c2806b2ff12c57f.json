However, outside of the halls of power and beyond diplomatic chatter there is a subtle, if imperceptible shift heralding a potentially more impactful climate awakening. Th ose favoring grandiose solutions to the very real challenges posed by climate change will fi nd no victory with the advent of true market-based solutions to climate risk. For one, these shifts in the market are brought forth without presidential decree and signing ceremonies. Rather, they are brought about the same way each economic revolution occurs-with the inexorable drive among entrepreneurs, engineers, planners and risk managers tackling the immediacy of problems, with practical solutions for which the market is willing to pay.",

Europe has been awakened by increasingly severe storms, fl oods, and other weather events. Australia routinely battles drought, and California has been tormented by persistent droughts and wildfi res that have triggered water rationing on a scale the state and, indeed, the U.S., has not seen since the Dust Bowl dried up much of the country during the 1930s. 7 As is the case with so many aspects of man-made risk, climate change, which is certainly exacerbated by man and our inexorable carbon footprint that is leaving a deep impression on the planet's complex ecosystem, is most felt by the most vulnerable. Climate change is driving the very real specter of water wars and the rise in piracy in East Africa, which is, in no small measure, triggered by the scarcity of resources on land. Indeed, the perennial confl icts in the Middle East are not only fueled by centuries-old animus, but by control of natural resources, from fresh water in the Golan Heights to access to open water in the Mediterranean. 8 Indeed, the casus belli for Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 was so that Russia could regain control of its erstwhile Soviet-era access to the warm water port in Sevastopol. 9 Th e veritable 'land grab' taking place under rapidly shrinking polar ice caps is a sign of how climate change is no longer a distant prognosis, but rather a current malady desperately in need of treatment. Shipping fi rms, as well as nations, are contemplating the impact on global trade using northern open ocean routes. 10 We will derive little comfort from receiving goods faster if our cities are under water, however.",

Entire industries have cropped up, devoted to energy effi ciency. Economic breakthroughs are afoot in virtually every aspect of the so-called 'green' economy. And while many of these micro-battles in the climate standards war may have gone unnoticed in the 2015 Paris Climate Change Summit, 14 and other global summits to come, a whole generation of business leaders and entrepreneurs stand to create a lot of real economic value by making it a business priority for the world to stay in business. Th e world's ability to tackle climate change is the tragedy of the commons of our times, and perhaps the greatest risk we have ever faced-as well as being our greatest risk management failure. 15 Climate change was once managed as an 'externality' by risk managers and quants-one so big that they could not conceivably factor it into their pricing models or risk-hedging strategies. Th ere has also been a very dangerous remoteness to climate impacts, once seen as primarily the scourge of unfortunate and ill-prepared developing countries. Ethiopia's dire famine, triggered by persistent droughts, claimed the lives of nearly a million people across the Horn of Africa. 16 As recently as 2011, severe draughts revisited the region, killing at least 260,000 people, most of whom were in war-torn Somalia. 17 Until recently, these grim images served to form so many peoples' misconcep-tions about the African continent, so as to relegate its massive growth potential to more astute investors and countries. Today, climate change and the urgent need to fi nd solutions to it, is no longer being treated as an externality, but rather something for which organizations and societies must be prepared.",

It combines propping up often-decrepit national institutions and fi nancial systems, spurring infrastructure investment, and creating fi rst-response capabilities. Above all, the development of nascent local insurance capabilities is critical, and this must be combined with greater interconnections with global insurance and reinsurance capacity. Many protectionist government policies preclude greater integration with global insurance markets, relegating many countries to off set local and regional risks with often shallow, opaque and unregulated insurance pools.",

On the one hand, military intervention is most often associated with armed confl ict or a takeover, and people in developing countries have long memories of occupation. On the other hand, many of the worst disasters (man-made or naturally occurring) can only be tackled with the superior logistics and personnel capabilities controlled by the military. Duplicitous actions blurring humanitarian neutrality-such as Colombian paramilitary units posing as Red Cross workers to free Ingrid Betancourt from the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia -severely hamper global relief eff orts, especially when there is no other choice but to bring in the cavalry. 28 From the desertifi cation of already arid lands caused by persistent droughts to torrential downpours and a record-breaking El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, the worst impacts of climate change are being felt south of the equator. Latin American countries, such as Panama, which did the right thing by the renewable energy 'manual' of the 1980s with its reliance on hydropower, is now facing energy shortages and a head-on collision course with climate change. Th is confl uence of events comes at a time when the country's growth and energy needs are outpacing its capacity to produce suffi ciently diversifi ed energy. Th e adoption of greener energy alternatives the world over is partly suppressed by persistently cheap oil prices and a standard 'war' that is being waged by the alternative energy market. Th ere is no \"one size fi ts all\" approach to powering economies. net contribution to climate change lower, but their ability to respond and rebuild stricken communities is, as we have noted, greatly impaired. While climate change invariably deals with large-scale science and phenomena, micro-climate impacts are increasingly commonplace. China's smog crisis (caused by severe industrial pollution and coal-fi red power plants) is linked to major respiratory ailments and a dramatic rise in lung cancer. 29 Similarly, the temporary ban of vehicle traffi c in Paris due to lingering noxious smog that aff ected the city in 2015, serve as reminders of just how fragile our ecosystem is. 30 Adverse micro-level changes like these provide case studies on both the consequences and societal responses to climate change. Aff ected cities adopt 'a life goes on' attitude and people and commerce proceed at a slower pace, while donning a surgical mask, popularized as a low-cost adaptation to air pollution and communicable respiratory diseases in Asia. 31 In European cities, where people are already used to pedaling to work, bicycle use has skyrocketed and alternate forms of mass transit are available.",

John Hancock, a U.S. subsidiary of the Manulife Financial Corporation, unveiled an innovative whole life insurance policy in partnership with Vitality, a pioneering South African wellness program. 53 In this solution, traditional life insurance customers combat longevity risk by wearing a Fitbit device that rewards a healthy lifestyle with a combination of incentives and real savings on premiums, which for a whole life insurance policy can range in excess of $50,000.",

Following total loss claims, some homeowner's policies require rebuilding houses with environmentally friendly materials and systems, such as use of natural light and solar panels, among others. 54 Options for harnessing insurance and fi nancial incentives beyond the traditional indemnifi cation off er a compelling, if underexplored, area for innovation. Similar possibilities also abound to hedge large-scale losses. Harnessing the depth, liquidity, and actuarial capabilities in the private sector will help not only an individual household vis-\u00e0-vis climate change, but also highly exposed industries and society writ large. Clearly, the scale of the potential economic consequences are such that it will require true cross-sector collaboration.

Additionally, reductions in interest rates due to early redemption or extensions in the notes can potentially hamper investor returns. 59 Cat bonds are unequivocally appealing in that they are one of the few investment vehicles that can help diversify away business cycle exposures in a portfolio. While in turn this exposes investors to the often misunderstood peril of natural catastrophes and the opacity of risk modelling agencies, the trade-off is nonetheless attractive.
