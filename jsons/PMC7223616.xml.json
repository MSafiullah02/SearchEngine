This growth can be attributed to advances in medicine and the aging of the baby boomer generation [2, 3]. Majority of older adults and baby boomers wish to age in place [1], that is, they want to age in their own home and community [4\u20136]. However, many older adults experience barriers to aging in place [7], with unavailability of housing, inadequate or lack of healthcare resources, and scarcity of social supports perhaps the most pressing challenges. One approach to reducing these barriers and promoting aging in place, independence, and healthy aging is the development and implementation of healthcare technology, such as healthcare robotics.",

While these previous reviews provide an in-depth synopsis of the state of the art of the healthcare robotics field, our goal is to provide an overview of healthcare robotics to support healthy aging as a contextual reference. We aim to focus on the future challenges of healthcare robotics and how such technology can support healthy aging and our healthcare system. Therefore, we next categorize future human-robot interaction (HRI) considerations and challenges at the individual, interpersonal, community, and societal levels via a socio-ecological inspired framework. The novelty of this review is this multilevel framework to be used as a useful organizational structure to consider the future of integration of robotics at multiple levels of older adult healthcare. We will close this review with acknowledging gaps in the literature and considerations for future research in healthcare robotics.",

This definition is important because it highlights the physical, mental (cognitive), and social aspects of healthy aging \u2013 all areas in which healthcare robotics has potential to support. Healthcare robotics is an umbrella term that describes a number of robot classifications; social companion robots, assistive robots, tele-robots, telepresence robots, and socially assistive robots (SARs) being a few common terms used in the literature. These types of robots serve both independent and shared functions; however, we will focus less on the classification of robot (for overview of healthcare robot classifications, see [19]) and instead focus on how healthcare robots, broadly defined, can provide physical, cognitive, and social supports for older adults.",

Typically, commercially available robots that assist with physical tasks are specialty robots \u2013 that is, they perform a single task. For example, assistance with home cleaning is a task many older adults state that they feel comfortable with a robot assisting with. The Roomba, to date, is perhaps the most popular specialized home cleaning robot assistant that is commercially available [21]. This robot assists with vacuuming, using sensors and artificial intelligence to learn an environment. Specialized assistance with home cleaning tasks, such as vacuuming, can remove the burden of having to carry out tasks that can be physically demanding. Roomba, and other robots like it, can help older adults maintain their home and age in place successfully. In fact, older adults have expressed the most interest in robots which could assist in performing IADLs [22\u201324], such as chores (e.g., housework), manipulating objects (e.g., lifting heavy objects), and information management tasks (e.g., reminding, monitoring a person, and transmitting information for help if the person falls).",

However, data from a series of qualitative studies [22\u201324] has shown that older adults were selective about task preference, even within a healthcare category. For instance, older adults prefer robot assistance with medication reminders and delivery (e.g., a robot can bring a bill bottle to an older adult), whereas they preferred human assistance medication decision-making [23]. Therefore, for even highly related healthcare tasks, such as medication management, older adults were discriminating.",

Social robots have been researched and developed to operate as a number of social companion roles, such as partners, peers, or assistants; this will allow them to exhibit flexibility and adaptability [36] to support social interaction with a wide range of older adults. Social robots, such as companion robots, can help older adults remain engaged and assist with social interaction [37, 38], as well as improve psychological status and overall well-being [39]. The most widely researched and available companion robot is Paro, a robotic seal. Paro, as well as other companion robots, has been shown to reduce stress and encourage socialization, improving older adults\u2019 quality of life [34, 40\u201343]. Furthermore, companion robots have contributed to a decrease loneliness and increased emotional engagement among older adults [44]. Moreover, healthcare robotics can help support interaction between users. Telepresence robots are defined as systems that provide two-way audio and video, on a mobile base (sometimes referred to as tele-conferencing on wheels). Telepresence robots can enable older adults to connect to their remotely located family, friends, and health providers [45, 46].",

The effectiveness of healthcare robotics in supporting healthy aging is dependent on these demographics, which are identified as moderators of technology acceptance [47, 48]. Demographic considerations need to be extended to the older adults\u2019 care partner(s). For example, the age of care partner can vary significantly as a care partner may include a family member, a friend, or a formal caregiver. Therefore, familiarity and comfort level with technology use, including healthcare robotics, may vary. Furthermore, often discussed in the literature is the high cost often associated with robots [49, 50, 51\u2022]. These barriers hold weight in ensuring that all older adults and care partners are able to access and afford healthcare robots. This is particularly important as healthcare robots may have the potential to improve access to quality healthcare for individuals who may otherwise have limited or no access [52\u2022\u2022].",

The implementation of healthcare robots across various living arrangements requires a dynamic set of functions and technical specifications needed to ensure effectiveness and suitability [62, 65]. Implementation of technology in older adults\u2019 homes can be challenging, as not all older adults have access to high-speed networking and many (most) older adult homes are not ADA compliant (American Disabilities Act). For example, a home-based healthcare robot may need to navigate stairs, multiple types of flooring, and dynamic obstacles (e.g., furniture, pets) to operate effectively, whereas a robot deployed in an institutional setting (e.g., assisted living or retirement community) will operate in a more controlled setting with wider doorways, ADA accessible floors (e.g., elevators and ramps), and IT support. Therefore, the computational and engineering requirements for healthcare robots to be implemented in diverse settings (home vs. institutional care) will vary considerably. Not only will the robot need to adapt to the environment but also adapt to the individual needs of the older adult and care partners.

Ethical principles are needed to help structure practitioners\u2019 and providers\u2019 understanding of how and when healthcare robots might be used [75, 76]. For example, the replacement of medical providers by healthcare robots may create an elimination of a human element in healthcare service provision [51\u2022]. Furthermore, the increased involvement of robots in the provision of care may also affect individuals\u2019 moral agency and autonomy. Policies should aim to help regulate and ensure the safety and efficacy of interventions carried out by healthcare robots.

Specifically, we highlight the potential for robots to assist with physical, cognitive, and social supports. To date, much of the robotics literature focuses on the research, development, and implementation of healthcare robots to assist with physical tasks, such as IADLs [34, 80, 81]. Older adults are somewhat less accepting of robots assisting with personal care tasks (e.g., some ADLs such as grooming and dressing); however, if robots can safely and reliably be developed to assist with these tasks, they have potential to provide support to many older adults with age-related declines [13, 82, 83]. Healthcare robots also hold much potential in providing social supports \u2013 particularly telepresence robotics that can facilitate social connection with remote family, friends, and healthcare providers [84\u201387].",

We utilize a socio-ecological perspective to organize and describe these challenges along the individual, care partner, community healthcare, and the Federal/State healthcare system. This organizational structure is useful, although it is important to note that this is nested system and many of the issues discussed in this paper (e.g., technology acceptance, ethics, clinical effectiveness) span across multiple levels. While our review is not exhaustive, we believe that our synthesis of the literature provides a roadmap for future research and technology development \u2013 with a plethora of exciting considerations and challenges to address. Healthcare robotics holds much promise to support older adults in healthy aging. Thus, consideration of the technology\u2019s implications at all levels of the healthcare system is a crucial step forward in making healthcare robotics a universally accepted technology in older adults\u2019 daily care.",
