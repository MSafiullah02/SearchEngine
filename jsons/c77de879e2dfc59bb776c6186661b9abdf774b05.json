Ventilatory demand [total ventilation (VE)], can be assessed as the relative contribution of tidal volume (VT) and respiratory rate (RR). The efficiency ventilatory (VE) must increase with the production of carbon dioxide (VCO2) (that is, the slope and the VE/VCO2 ratio) 12 The organism is continually undergoing changing O2 demands, that depend on metabolic activity, therefore, ventilation must adapt to this demand by increasing the respiration rhythm and carrying out a more appropriate respiration 18 ",

That is why, as the safety distance cannot be controlled in confined space, athletes should wear suitable masks to avoid the transmission of particles. Therefore, as results from our study and the considerations made by the Belgian/Holand group, we believe that the assessment of the secure distance must be more accurate precise specially when we want practice physical activity. Without any doubt we think that is very important to mind the respiratory flows.",

Also, the maximum tidal volume (VTmax) can reach about 2-2.5 L (VT does not usually exceed 55-65% of the VC, both in sedentary and athletes) 15,16 . Modifications in VT and RF have influence in alveolar ventilation (VA). This (VA) is the amount of air that go into the alveoli every minute and participates in the respiratory exchange. This fact is fundamental because this respiratory exchange only occurs in the alveoli and not in the respiratory tract (airways). Di Paco et al.17 have demonstrated that an improved ventilatory profile response after training, must contributes to increased sports performance, despite the fact there are no significant changes in heart rate (HR) at a determinate rate.",

Therefore, it is appropriate to review the infection control rule established in 1-2 m 3 . Now, most horizontal droplet transmission studies show distances of more than 2 m. Bahl et al. 22 in their review indicated that there are few studies on horizontal spread of droplets in medical journals. By this, they have reviewed in other sciences such mathematical and engineering disciplines to emit they conclusions. They have concluded that the maximum distance in 8 m.
