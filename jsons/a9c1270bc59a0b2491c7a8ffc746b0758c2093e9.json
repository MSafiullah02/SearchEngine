Telemedicine has been a revolutionary tool for clinicians in this pandemic because it enabled continued medical care while maintaining social distancing and allowed patients who are at greater risk for morbidity and mortality from Covid-19 infection the ability to get medical assessments without leaving their homes 1 . With the utility of telemedicine being proven in this pandemic, it strengthens the argument that the utilization of telemedicine should be incorporated into routine medical care.",

For patients, office visits led to long commutes, wait times, and increased exposure to infectious diseases, with health care providers also at increased risk of infection 2 . Additionally, the routine physical examination, which is an integral part of a traditional office visit, often does not contribute to the medical plan. For example, annual physicals have been found to have no effect on total mortality, cancer mortality, and likely no effect on cardiovascular mortality or risk of strokes 3 . Studies found that the majority of diagnosis is attributed to the medical history and little from the physical exam 4 . Furthermore, telehealth visits can include focused physical examination maneuvers using image-and audiocapturing devices to assess the dermatologic, cardiac, and pulmonary systems 2 .",

Through telehealth systems, it has been found that patients with chronic illnesses had better mortality, quality of life, and hospital readmission outcomes 5 . A study also found that 95% of patients who participated in a telehealth visit rated it as good as, if not better than, a traditional office visit 2 . It is now, in a time of crisis, that we should embrace innovation, not for just in this moment, but for the future. We must incorporate the technology that we have already leveraged, and further invest in novel approaches to improve the safety, experience, and capability of telehealth to optimize health care delivery without sacrificing quality. Though modern technology, doctors can again travel to patient homes with a modern version of a physician house call.",
