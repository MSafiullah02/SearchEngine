Although the majority of these fractures are nondisplaced and amenable to cast immobilization, approximately 24% will require operative fixation 2 . Furthermore, nearly 90% of surgically indicated fractures will undergo closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP), and approximately 10% will need to be treated with an open surgical procedure 2 .

In brief, the semisterile technique involves using 3 or 4 sterile towels to isolate and prepare only the exposed elbow after reduction is confirmed on fluoroscopy, prior to draping or toweling. An iodine povacrylex and isopropanol surgical antiseptic applicator (DuraPrep; 3M) is then used to sterilize the area of interest. Sterile gloves are worn, but a surgical gown is not (Fig. 1 ). If anatomic reduction is not obtained and an open procedure is needed, conversion to a full sterile preparation can easily be performed prior to any cutaneous incision. Pins are then inserted percutaneously in the routine fashion. The procedure may be performed by a single surgeon or with an assistant using sterile gloves.

Therefore, savings of $98.20 per case and associated PPE preservation could be expected by utilizing a semisterile technique.

Prior literature on departures from classical orthopaedic sterility measures (multilayered surgical draping and perioperative antibiotics) has suggested that this does not impact the baseline infection risk 7, 8, 15 in CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures 8, 9 . Further, even the rare pin-track infection that occurs regardless of adherence to traditional sterility measures is typically of limited clinical importance, often resolving with only daily hygiene [15] [16] [17] [18] . These data have been extrapolated and applied to adult percutaneous skeletal fixation of hand fractures, with equally promising results and cost savings using the semisterile technique 9, 19 . As such, these findings speak to the relative safety of closed reduction and percutaneous skeletal fixation procedures. When considered on a larger scope, our findings are predictable. Many bedside procedures, such as suture repair of traumatic lacerations, application of skeletal or cervical traction, or joint aspiration or injection, are frequently performed without the use of a mask or full sterile preparation. Under typical circumstances, the cost of perfunctory use of full preparation with gowns and drapes for CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures (or any of these bedside procedures) is not inconsequential, but, in the pandemic landscape, this may unnecessarily burden a system desperate for PPE to protect health-care providers treating a virulent infectious agent 11, 20, 21 .",

That group also reported atypically high complication rates (7.3% pin-track infections, 8.3% iatrogenic nerve injury, and 11.5% loss of reduction), despite no deep infections 10 . Therefore, our contemporary, large, singleinstitution series clarifies the remaining gaps from the prior literature and expands on the potential for cost savings and resource preservation. Given the existing series, it seems that the semisterile technique is safe and could save millions of dollars annually. Importantly, this is also an opportunity for PPE resource preservation under normal circumstances. A nationwide adoption of this policy will diminish costs and enable resource reallocation.

First, given the retrospective nature of this study, causality could not be determined. Second, the rate of deep infection following CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture was exceedingly low 8 . To be sufficiently powered to detect even a doubling of the infection rate between cohorts (with an infection rate of 0.47%), nearly 5,000 patients per group would be required. Although our series is, to our knowledge, the largest reported on the subject from the United States and our zero infections in the semisterile cohort is reassuring, this study should serve as the impetus for a larger, multi-institution study powered to detect differences in infectious outcomes. Third, we excluded frac-tures managed nonoperatively. The potential benefits of CRPP for Type-II fractures, especially those without medial comminution, should be carefully assessed and cautiously weighed against the risk of operative intervention. Our belief is that many less-displaced Type-II fractures may be successfully managed with closed treatment while more-displaced fractures should undergo CRPP to prevent malunion 7, 23 . Additionally, our cost estimates are based on institutional data, which may limit external validity. To improve generalizability, we used estimated, per minute, operating room costs 24 and favored conservative estimates 14 . Further, foregoing mask wear would be contrary to the CDC recommendations 25 during pandemic situations and is therefore not recommended at this time. Although children seem to have a low risk of severe symptomatic disease, they can be asymptomatic carriers of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, and our data do not permit definitively commenting on the safety of the surgeon when foregoing PPE during the COVID-19 era 26 . However, the reduction of surgeon PPE does not appear to increase postoperative infections. Lastly, exposure data in this series were self-reported, which is known to be subject to bias 27 .",

This study highlights the fact that an arbitrary approach to sterility may need reevaluation during these unique times. As previously noted, the CDC recommends surgical mask use. However, surgeons should reevaluate whether gowns are necessary for all procedures. Although surgical gowns are not traditionally used as frontline PPE, unprecedented shortages have necessitated creative, if not questionable, measures to protect vulnerable providers, and we hope that the reallocations proposed in this study both contribute to our health-care system and stimulate further efforts. In the long term, the semisterile technique affords resource stewardship and portends substantial national cost savings. Given these advantages of the semisterile technique, without obvious associated patient risk, we advocate for adoption of the semisterile technique for CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, especially during current relief efforts. We encourage others to closely review their procedures to look for similar opportunities to identify areas where conservation efforts could lessen the burden on the health-care system now and in the future. n",
