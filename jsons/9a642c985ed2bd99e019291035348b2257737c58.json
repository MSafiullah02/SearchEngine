The viruses were found to have a 4--6 hour eclipse phase in L 132 cells at 33 ~ C. Both viruses were completely inhibited by raising the incubation temperature to 39 ~ C, and there was also a depression in the yield of virus at 30 ~ C compared with control cultures maintained at 33 ~ C. \"Shift\" experiments have indicated that the high temperature-sensitive event occurred fairly late on in the replicative cycle, but the time could not be accurately determined.",

The infectious centre counts reached 30--50% of maximal levels within 15 minutes of mi~ing virus and cells, but the levels continued to rise throughout the incubation period. To detect any interferon present in the virus pool, the infectivity was destroyed by dialysis against buffer at pH 2 for 12 hours at r C. After subsequent dialysis against pI-I 7.2 buffer, no interferon-like activity could be detected as judged by the lack of growth inhibition of Sindbis virus in L 132 cells. The third possibility was that some form of autointerferenee might be operating, as has been found with arboviruses or with vesicular stomatitis virus (ClZlCK, CAI~TWl~IG~IT and BI~OW~, 1969) under certain conditions. In conditions of autointerference, the normal relationship between the input multiplicity and the efficiency of infection or yield of virus does not operate. Thus, dilution of virus might result in an increased number of infected eells as the interfering activity is diluted out. The relationship between the dilution of a pool of 229 E virus and the ability of the pool to form infectious eentres was therefore studied. The adsorption period was 2 hours at 30 ~ C, after whieh cells were washed and assayed for infectious eentres as described. The experiment shown in Figure 1 used a concentration of 1 X 106 cells per ml and the input multiplicity was varied from 0.82 to 0.0082 p.f.u./ml. However, the proportion of infectious centres rose on dilution of the virus pool, reaching a maximum at a 1 in 5 dilution of virus. At a dilution of 1 in 100 the virus produced as many infectious centres as were formed using undiluted virus. Nevertheless, even the maximum number of infectious centre formed was 5-fold lower than the level predicted from the proportion of virus which had adsorbed to cells. Using the standard conditions, detailed in the \"Materials and Methods\", the growth curves of both 229 E and LP viruses in L 132 cells were investigated. The production of cell-associated and cell-free virus was measured; infectious centres and adsorbed multiplicities were also estimated. The data for these experiments are given in Table 3 and the results displayed in Figure 2 .",

Because of the low proportion of cells initially infected, multiple cycles of infection were likely, but in fact did not seem to occur since virus titres reached a maximum at 10--12 hours and stayed at that level for the remaining 12 hours of the experiments. This only applied to the cell-associated virus; cell-free virus titres continued to rise throughout the period of observation. At 10 hours after infection there was 10-fold less cell-free than cell-associated virus ; but with 229 E virus, the virus was released as rapidly as it was formed. In all cases the final yield of virus was very low (2--6 p. I. u./infectious centres).",

The plaque counts at 33 ~ and 35 ~ C were similar, but at 37 ~ C there were less plaques (60% for 229 E and 50% for LP). To investigate the effects of temperature on the replication of coronaviruses during a single infectious cycle, cells were infected with either 229 E or LP viruses at 33 ~ C and then divided into aliquots which were maintained at various temperatures between 30 ~ and 39 ~ C.

An autoinhibition effect has been observed when undiluted egg fluids containing infectious bronchitis virus are passaged serially (McDougal, personal communication) . The large proportion of uninfectious virus particles may be interfering with the adsorption or replication of the remainder.
