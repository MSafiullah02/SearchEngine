Additionally, recent data demonstrated that HPV is also associated with a subset of head and neck cancers (HNCs), including a worldwide range ~20\u201380% of oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs) [4, 5]. Individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV+) are more susceptible to infection, less likely to clear the virus and have a higher risk of HPV-related cancers than HIV-negative (HIV-) individuals [6, 7]. Although the incidence of overall cancer has decreased in HIV+ individuals with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HPV-related CC risk is higher among HIV+ individuals [8, 9]. Moreover, in HIV+ women, CC tends to respond poorly to recommended therapies, becomes more aggressive, and may have a worse prognosis [6]. With the increase in survival of HIV+ women due to HAART, progression of oncogenic viral infection into malignancy may result in an increased incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal, genital, and anal cancers [8\u201310].",

            "text": "Currently, the HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic impacts the poorest and the youngest in low-resource settings [11]. HIV+ young women are key populations at high risk for developing HPV-related cancers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries such as Brazil [12, 13]. With the recent approval of the 9-valent HPV vaccine, the risks of persistent HPV infection and HPV-related cervical precancerous lesions and malignancies are expected to decrease significantly [14]. With the appropriate vaccination rate thresholds, this vaccine provides a logical rationale for increasing screening intervals considering the anticipated decrease in the burden of disease [15]. Therefore, understanding the specific prevalence, distribution and concordance of cervical and oral HPV in at-risk women in specific geographic locations will provide further insight into the effectiveness of this new vaccine against oral HPV infection, which has not been proven yet. Considering the high burden of HPV-related cancers among HIV+ women and the possible effectiveness of a 9-valent HPV vaccine [16], it is critical to understand the prevalence and types of HPV infections in oral and cervical mucosa in HIV+ women (and matched controls). However, while several studies on HIV+ women have reported cervical, oral, or anal HPV type distribution [17\u201323], only a few studies have addressed concurrent cervical and oral HPV prevalence [24\u201326]. Despite the demonstrated role of HPV in the etiology of CC and the strong evidence suggesting the importance of HPV in the development of OPC [27\u201330], several aspects of the interrelationship between oral and cervical infections remain unknown, specifically in HIV+ female patients.",

Participants were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire to obtain demographic information (e.g., age, educational attainment, household income, race/ethnicity); tobacco and alcohol use/abuse; obstetric and gynecologic history (e.g., age at menarche, contraceptive use, number of pregnancies); CC screening, and sexual behaviors (e.g., age at first intercourse, number of sexual partners).

These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that the natural history of HPV infection varies by anatomical site, and a higher prevalence of HPV infection is observed in the cervical mucosa than in the oral mucosa in HIV+ women [36\u201338]. This can be explained, at least in part, by the evidence that the oral cavity is a hostile environment for the establishment of infectious agents due to the presence of both mechanical and molecular mechanisms related to digestion [39]. More specifically, Fakhry et al. [39] conducted a study that directly compared the local immunologic profiles of the oral cavities and cervices of healthy women using paired secretion specimens. This study showed that the oral cavity contained significantly higher concentrations of immunoregulatory factors that were related to the adaptive and cell-mediated immune response than the cervix, which may in part explain the significantly lower burden of sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis, HPV, and HIV-1 in the oral cavity than in the cervix. According to the authors, these findings provide additional information to better understand the differences in the etiology and natural history of pathogenic agents that are capable of colonizing both the oral cavity and female reproductive tract.",

The high prevalence of non-vaccine hrHPV types of 2-valent and 4-valent vaccines in the cervical and oral mucosa found in our study suggests that the 9-valent HPV vaccine is significantly required, which is considered important to reduce the risk of developing HPV-related cancers, specifically in the HIV+ population.",

Several studies have already demonstrated that smoking status acts as a predictor and cofactor in cervical HPV infection, which is possibly due to the alteration of the mucosa cells, making them more susceptible to infection, changing the immune mediators, causing DNA damage, and promoting the integration of HPV DNA into the host genome [42\u201345].",
