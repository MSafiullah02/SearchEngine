Lead-zinc mining and smelting activities are, however, some of the primary sources of heavy metals pollution (Horvath and Gruiz, 1996, Tong et al., 2000). Lead exposure, which can cause increased blood-lead levels and affect many tissues and systems in the body, was responsible for about 143,000 deaths and 0.6% of the global burden of disease in 2004 and can seriously endanger human health (WHO, 2004, WHO, 2009). Where, then, should health and governmental policy makers place their concerns with respect to these issues?",

Such a puzzle-like phenomenon has been so robust that local villagers tend to continue to practice unprotected mining regardless of any legal prohibitions (Y. Li, Wang, Yang, & Li, 2005). For example, the situation in the Dabaoshan heavy metal mining areas has frustrated the public at large because local private mining still exists, even after being shut down by the government several times from 1993 to 2005. Such unprotected mining has caused at least 250 deaths from cancer in the last 20 years (M. Wang et al., 2011). This continued private mining by local individuals can be seen as an evidence of being likely to \u2018sail close to the wind\u2019 with respect to environmental issues. The problem raised in this study is how to understand such a puzzle-like phenomenon from the perspective of risk perception and risk analysis.",

Guedeney and Mendel (1973) reported that, in a local attitude survey about a nuclear power station in France, anxiety was lower among those living closer to the nuclear reactor. Maderthaner, Guttmann, Swaton, and Otway (1978) also found that people living far from a nuclear research reactor perceived it to be riskier than the nearer residents. Tilt (2006) reported that, although industrial workers labored on a daily basis under highly polluted conditions, they provided risk ratings that were well below those of farmers and commercial/service sector workers who were far from the polluting sources.",

Contrary to conventional wisdom and to the ripple effect (Kasperson et al., 1988), that the impact of an unfortunate event decays gradually as ripples spread outward from a center, the psychological typhoon eye effect was observed one month after the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, where the post-earthquake concern of a convenience sample of 2262 adults was at its lowest level in the most severely devastated areas.",

In fact, this phenomenon can be demonstrated in many contexts. In the context of terrorist attacks, a post-9/11 study of New York City public school children showed that children from the schools nearest to Ground Zero had significantly less psychopathology than children from more remote schools (Hoven et al., 2005). In the context of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it was reported that the level of exposure to SARS was not a primary determinant of experienced anxiety; nearness to the center of the epidemic was negatively related to anxiety levels (Xie, Stone, Zheng, & Zhang, 2011). Also in the context of earthquake, it was reported that a village closer to the epicenter of the earthquake (0.5 km) that occurred in 1998 in northern Hebei province, China, had considerably fewer cases of PTSD than one that was further away (10 km) from the epicenter (X. Wang et al., 2000). A similar study by J. Xie, Xie, and Gan (2011) showed that the perceived risk of experiencing an aftershock by residents of devastated cities (e.g., Hanwang, Panzhihua) was lower than the perceived risk of aftershocks in the devastated area by people in a non-devastated city (e.g., Beijing). All these studies assessed the relationship between a disaster and a social cognitive reaction as a function of geometric distance. As Harada (2011) pointed out in a special issue on \u201cCognitive Studies in the Real World\u201d in Psychologia, \u201cThe results are especially insightful for Japanese readers after the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011.\u201d (Harada, 2011).",

The psychological typhoon eye effect was previously found and reported in acute nature-caused risk, acute human-caused risk, and chronic human-caused risk (see Table 1\nfor details). Given that the activities of lead-zinc mining and smelting are the primary sources of heavy metals pollution in Feng village and that the mining risks were constant and subtle, we categorized the risk investigated in the current study as chronic human-caused risk.

            "text": "Despite the fact that similar, interesting findings have appeared in many studies, the mechanism of the psychological typhoon eye effect is unclear. Attempts have been made to identify possible/alternative explanations. For instance, the psychological immunization theory assumes that resistance to adverse life events is naturally acquired through repeated exposure (Henderson, Montgomery, & Williams, 1972). Residents in devastated quake areas are presumed to be provided with an increased psychological immunity to the severe disaster by their natural exposure to hazardous stimuli. Some previous researchers (e.g. Li et al., 2009a, Maderthaner et al., 1978) viewed the psychological immunization theory as a possible explanation and mentioned it in their discussion. To test whether the psychological immunization theory could account for the psychological typhoon eye effect, Li et al. (2010) asked respondents to indicate the extent and frequency of their personal exposure to the earthquake damage, using a six-point scale (from \u2018\u2018not at all\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018extremely strong\u2019\u2019 for the extent and from \u201cnever\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018always\u2019\u2019 for the frequency). The covariance analysis in Li et al.'s (2010) study revealed that the psychological typhoon eye effect was independent of the extent of exposure to hazardous stimuli. This result suggested that the psychological immunization theory is insufficient to account for the psychological typhoon eye effect. The residents did not receive increased psychological immunity to the severe disaster by personal exposure to hazardous stimuli. Before we can accept the conclusion that the residents had not received such increased psychological immunity, however, the distinctions between exposure to hazardous stimuli and people's subjective perceptions of the same stimulus (Brewer and Hallman, 2006, Howarth, 1988) should be taken into account.",

(2009) might be Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance, which is defined as an uncomfortable psychological state in which two opposing cognitions, which ultimately need to be reconciled, are experienced (Festinger, 1962). As remarked in a blog by Gray (2010), the devastation of an area creates a sense of danger, yet an individual may have no choice but to remain close by, counter to their survival instinct. To reconcile these conflicting beliefs, the individual may unconsciously lower their self-assessed risk to justify remaining in the area. However, the cognitive dissonance account has not yet been directly tested, mainly because it is difficult to manipulate the levels of cognitive dissonance in a field study. Because the level of cognitive dissonance cannot be measured and manipulated in the center of the lead-zinc mining risk area, we decided not to test the cognitive dissonance account in the present study.",

            "text": "Alternatively, a so called \u201cperceived benefit\u201d account has been proposed by several investigators. X. Wang et al. (2000) proposed a possible explanation of why the villagers closer to the epicenter had a considerably lower level of PTSD. They proposed that this was because the closer village was allotted considerably greater immediate disaster relief and subsequent reconstruction support because they had been assessed by government relief authorities as having suffered greater damage. These resources in turn appeared to have helped buffer members of the village from developing chronic PTSD reactions (Wang et al., 2000). Tilt's (2006) study on risk perception from industrial pollution proposed that the reason the risk rating provided by industrial workers was lower than that provided by farmers and commercial/service sector workers was that the industrial workers could earn more monthly income than the others could. The perceived benefit account is also consistent with the health belief model (Janz & Becker, 1984) and protection motivation theory (Floyd, Prentice\u2013Dunn, & Rogers, 2000; Rogers, Cacioppo, & Petty, 1983), which were originally proposed to predict behavior in the context of personal health threats. Janz and Becker (1984) found that a kind of cost-benefit analysis occurred wherein an individual weighs the healthy action's effectiveness against perceptions that it may be unpleasant or time-consuming. The severity and vulnerability assessments are reduced by perceived intrinsic and extrinsic rewards from the unhealthy behavior (Rogers et al., 1983). Bockarjova and Steg (2014) first applied protection motivation theory to slow-onset environmental risk and found that higher perceived rewards associated with a conventional vehicle negatively affected adoption of electric vehicles. Because the perceived benefit account is reasonable but lacks abundant empirical evidence in environmental studies, the second aim of the present study was to empirically test whether the perceived benefit account can explain an involvement version, that is, that involvement in risky mining decreases risk perception, of the psychological typhoon eye effect. If the perceived benefit account is correct, we should observe a negative relationship between the perceived benefit and risk perception. Because risk perception can be taken to be a function of perceived benefit and perceived harm (Holtgrave & Weber, 1993), we further hypothesized that both perceived benefit and perceived harm might be correlated with risk perception by the villagers.",

As an example of panic behavior, when the Fukushima incident happened after the Tohoku Earthquake on March 11, 2011, it was not the nearby Japanese but the Chinese who lived far away from Fukushima who engaged in panic buying of salt, causing supermarkets in some major cities to run out (Setiogi, 2011). Likewise, drug stores in Russia and British Columbia, Canada (but not Japan), reported shortages of iodine pills, in spite of health officials insisting that potassium iodide is not an anti-radiation drug (Chen, Shen, Ye, Chen, & Kerr, 2013). A very relevant case was reported in a news article entitled \u201cA survey showed that opponents of Jiangmen nuclear fuel project were not local residents but entrepreneurs from neighboring cities\u201d (\u8c03\u67e5\u79f0\u6c5f\u95e8\u53cd\u6838\u8005\u591a\u975e\u5f53\u5730\u666e\u901a\u7fa4\u4f17 \u5468\u8fb9\u57ce\u5e02\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bb6\u6210\u6025\u5148\u950b) (Observer, 2013). According to this report, the Jiangmen nuclear fuel project in China, which was valued at 40 billion CNY, was forced to be cancelled because of fierce opposition, not from residents of the central area (i.e., Jiangmen) but from residents of peripheral areas (that is, those are about 50\u2013100 km distance from Jiangmen; such as Zhongshan, Guangzhou and Foshan). This project met the same fate as paraxylene (PX) producing projects in China. Since 2007, the PX projects planned in Xiamen, Dalian, and Kunming were shut down because of public fears about possible environmental pollution. This sort of policy \u201cvoting\u201d behavior is not isolated to Chinese. The German government (rather than the Japanese government) was compelled to reevaluate nuclear power and, in a spectacular policy U-turn, made a decision to terminate nuclear power in Germany by 2022 because of opposition and demonstrations by German voters (Opinion polls show that 80% of Germans no longer accept nuclear power.) (Batsford, 2013). Nevertheless, whether these media reports were accurate is unclear due to a lack of scientific evidence.",

The administrative village consists of four historical villages with 346 local families, lodged within steep hills and roughly 40 km from the nearest county town. Mining activities in the area go back to the Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131912). Since 1994, the local villagers have had governmental permission to exploit the mines. At the time of an earlier survey, the state-owned or collective-owned mine enterprises had already officially been closed down to protect the environment (Lora-Wainwright, 2013). However, many private mines still operate in the village. The geographical distribution of the villages and mines are shown in Fig. 2\n, which clearly shows that the lead-zinc mines and villages are mixed within this area. Environmental geography studies found that the concentrations of lead (Pb) in the soil were much higher than Level 2 of the National Environmental Quality Standard for Soils in China (GB15618-1995), i.e., the level suitable for the soil of arable land, and that the lead levels in the blood of local residents and crops were above national safety levels in the \u201cFeng\u201d administrative villages.

We utilized the psychometric paradigm (Fischhoff et al., 1978, Slovic, 1987) as a research framework to measure risk perception about a lead-zinc mine. Three items for measuring risk perception about a lead-zinc mine were adapted from previous studies (Fischhoff et al., 1978, Xie et al., 2011b). The respondents were asked if they thought the pollution caused by the lead-zinc mine was serious, dreadful, and uncontrollable. For the measurement of the other constructs, new items related to lead-zinc mining were formulated according to the actual situation and interviews in the \u201cFeng\u201d village. To prepare for the benefit and harm measures, we interviewed 12 local villagers, three medical geographers who had previously carried out heavy metal pollution research in Feng village, and two staff members from the local Center for Disease Control (CDC). The questionnaire we developed was based on the first-hand information they provided. Four items were used to measure perceived benefit and eight items were used to measure perceived harm (see Table 3). Items were recoded so that higher values expressed a better perception of lead-zinc mining and lower values expressed a worse perception of lead-zinc mining. Another variable was \u201csupport for the relevant policy\u201d, which was intended to measure the villagers\u2019 voting intention. The items for measuring the support for a relevant policy were adapted from a study by Tanaka (2004). Our study obtained this information by asking questions about whether the participants or other villagers favored lead-zinc mining in the village. The questions were answered on a 5-point scale (see Table 3).",

One-factor and four-factor models were performed to test which model provided the best fit for the data (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). The hypothesized four-factor model yielded a better fit than the single-factor model (see Table 4\n) with a change in the chi-square of 275.98 (\u0394df = 10, p < 0.001). Second, all variables in the study had an acceptable Cronbach's \u03b1 value greater than 0.6 and were considered reliable (Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998).

An alternate statistic examines the ratio of \u03c72 to the df for the model (Hoe, 2008; Joreskog & Sorbom, 1986). Kline (1998) suggested that a \u03c72/df ratio of 3 or less is a reasonably good indicator of model fit. The GFI, CFI, and TLI should be greater than 0.90 to indicate an acceptable model fit.

A model is said to be nested within another model when the set of freely estimated parameters of the first model is a subset of those estimated in the second model (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). First, the hypothesized model was estimated to determine whether it fit the data. The model provided an acceptable fit (see Table 6\n) to the data. Although the \u03c72 was significant, the \u03c72/df ratio was less than 3. All of the standardized path coefficients for the hypothesized model yielded significant coefficients (ps < 0.001) in the appropriate direction. In accordance with recommendations from methodological experts (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988), we tested an alternative model to compare with the hypothesized model. Because previous studies (Siegrist et al., 2003, Tanaka, 2004) found that perceived benefit and perceived harm (Bower and Miller, 1960, Holtgrave and Weber, 1993) had an impact on behavioral tendencies such as support for the relevant policy, we estimated an alternative model to test whether the addition of paths from perceived benefit to support for the relevant policy and from perceived harm to support for the relevant policy would result in a significant improvement over the hypothesized model. If the addition of the paths significantly improved the model fit, this would indicate that the paths should be included in the model. The result showed that the standardized path estimate from perceived benefit to support for the relevant policy was significant, but from perceived harm to support for the relevant policy was not significant (\u03b2 = 0.11, p > 0.05), so this insignificant path was deleted from further analyses. Thus, the alternative model was a better fit to the data (see Table 6). Similar to the result from the hypothesized model, although the \u03c72 was significant, the \u03c72/df ratio was also less than 3 in the alternative model.",

As a result, we proceeded with further analyses using the alternative model. The path estimates for the final model are depicted in Fig. 4\n.

We dubbed it the \u2018\u2018involvement\u2019\u2019 version of the psychological typhoon eye effect in the lead-zinc mining area. That is, the more involved in lead-zinc mining the villagers were, the less they were concerned about the pollution risk from lead-zinc mining. This finding extends our understanding of the psychological typhoon eye effect. Unlike the fundamental effect, where the concern about safety and health was a function of geometric distance, the concern about safety and health reported in the present variation is a function of involvement distance, even though the geometric distance remained constant. In this type of case, in which the geometric distance remained unchanged (see map in Fig. 2), the cognitive dissonance account is unlikely to work and cannot be tested because of a lack of \u201cobjective dissonance\u201d. This is because all our participants shared the same degree of cognitive dissonance \u2013 there is a pollution risk from lead-zinc mining and they continue to live nearby and, therefore, would be expected to want to restore consistency or consonance. However, it could be argued that dissonance is a subjectively experienced phenomenon. In this sense, differences in psychological distance caused by involvement might lead to subjectively experienced cognitive dissonance. Future studies are needed to test whether subjectively experienced cognitive dissonance could account for the psychological typhoon eye effect.",

An awareness of the discrepancy between people who were involved more and those who were involved less in mining may enhance decisions in situations in which there are environmental health threats and may also enrich our understanding of how people can become resilient to different kinds of threats. The psychological typhoon eye effect has previously been detected and reported in three categories of risk (see Table 1, acute human-caused risk, acute nature-caused risk, and chronic human-caused risk). Although researchers have found the psychological typhoon eye effect in its original version in chronic human-caused risks, such as nuclear power stations, a variation termed the \u2018\u2018involvement\u2019\u2019 version was first explored within this category of risk. It is worth exploring whether other variations of the psychological typhoon eye effect can be applied in this risk category. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the psychological typhoon eye effect has not been reported in chronic nature-caused risk (see the bottom left cell of Table 1). It would be interesting to explore in future studies whether the psychological typhoon eye effect exists in chronic nature-caused risk.",

Wilson, Wheatley, Kurtz, Dunn, and Gilbert (2004) found that people predicted that losing would make them feel worse than it did and selected a higher dose of a drug (hypothetical medication) to cope with an anticipated loss than did people who actually lost. Likewise, some studies found evidence that was consistent with the idea that rare events seem to be given more weight when imagined (e.g. by reading the descriptive information) than when experienced (Hertwig and Erev, 2009, Rakow and Newell, 2010). However, a gap between experiencing and imagining is not the case in our study. The villagers under investigation all lived in the lead-zinc risk area, and the risks they perceived were not imagined but truly experienced.

These results suggested that cultural differences exist that may be important in investigating the psychological typhoon eye effect. Moreover, previous studies indicated that high levels of hazard-related anxiety could trigger avoidance and denial (Cameron & Leventhal, 2003) and thus further reduce the likelihood that people would prepare (Paton, Smith, & Johnston, 2005).

The distorted risk perception consequently influenced the observed support for the relevant policy. The \u2018support for the relevant policy\u2019 measured in the present study is a sort of \u201cvoting\u201d behavior.

Therefore, the present study on the impact of risk perception on \u2018support for the relevant policy\u2019 is of practical significance. The knowledge of how risk perception influences support for the relevant policy can help us to understand the cognitive process underlying policy voting, thereby provide a psychology-based theoretical foundation for facilitating people's foresight and green awareness.",

The villagers' low perception of risk as well as their pro-voting in many cases can be considered to be a \u201cdistorted\u201d action because the voters may be subject to economic temptation (such as the instant gain from mining). With this in mind, the agents of risk analysis and policymaking should be aware of the unique role that interest groups (such as mine owners) play in shaping policy choices. Apart from the involvement of an interest group, risk communication and risk management is understandable and people's responses are predictable. Once an interest group becomes involved in practicing, planning, or managing risk, the perceived risk as well as the interest-group's pro-voting becomes distorted, as revealed in the present study. Therefore, policy makers and managers involved in risk management should think twice about the desires of different interest groups before they act.",

As suggested by recent framing studies (Magen, Dweck, & Gross, 2008; Zhao et al., 2015), mentioning the \u201cobvious\u201d opportunity cost of alternatives may help decision makers choose in a more informed manner. That is, the explicitness of the opportunity cost in each alternative can influence the impulsive choice of the decision maker - the same option (mining activity) which is seen as a gain/reward in one frame (hidden frame) can be seen as a loss/cost in another frame (explicit frame). The second strategy could be to provide opportunities to make money from occupations other than lead-zinc mining. Considering the economic temptation (Janz & Becker, 1984), offering new options for making a living (such as planting cash crops) might reduce the attractiveness of lead-zinc mining.",
