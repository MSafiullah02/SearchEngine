With the new coronavirus infection, COVID-19, there is a risk of nosocomial infection. Glauser1 proposed a protocol to keep COVID-19 out of hospitals. However, the infection might be carried by medical personnel. The issue of COVID-19 among medical personnel working in the operating room has not been well clarified.",

These cases occurred in 2 different rural hospitals. The first case was an anesthesiologist and the second case was an internist working as a surgeon. These 2 patients had regular work rotations in operating rooms during the presymptomatic COVID-19 period.
