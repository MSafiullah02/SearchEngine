Soon after the easing of social distancing and lockdown, a surge in the new cases of COVID-19 was noted by health professionals. Consequently, PMA and other doctors' organizations held press conferences in Karachi [1] , Lahore [2] , and Peshawar [3] and demanded an extension of the lockdown and the implementation of strict measures to protect public health [5] . However, health providers' advice and pleas remain hitherto unheeded, and the general public remains confused and caught between divergent views and messages about the COVID-19 crisis.",
