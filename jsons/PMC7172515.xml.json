In vivo, APN is involved in the metabolism of angiotensin III in the degradation of nociceptin, in the brain and peripheral organs and in the inactivation of enkephalins, in association with neutral endopeptidase NEP [6], [7], [8]. Moreover, this enzyme has been proved to behave as a receptor for coronaviruses TGEV and 229E in humans and pigs, and to be identical to a human lymphocyte surface cluster differentiation antigen CD13 [9], [10], [11]. APN has been also reported to play a vital role in the invasion of metastatic tumors in vitro\n[12], [13]. All these findings make APN an important target for therapeutic applications, which require the development of selective and potent inhibitors [14].",

However, recently the clinical use of these APN inhibitors, has been limited due to their low selectivity and important drug resistance [14], [15].",

Thus, it is important to develop new small molecule inhibitors with novel modes of action. The development of such kind of drug is focused on how to design novel APN inhibitors. Chemical feature-based pharmacophores and virtual library screening may serve as a guide in the design of novel lead candidates. This study aims to construct the chemical feature-based pharmacophore model and identify novel scaffolds with the potential to turn as the new category of APN inhibitors.",

Binding Site Analysis tool available in Discovery Studio 2.5 (DS 2.5; Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), version 2.5, from Accelrys (San Diego, USA) has been used to create a sphere with a radius that comprises all the catalytically important amino acid residues in the ligand-binding pocket [16]. The Interaction Generation protocol implemented in DS was used to identify hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), hydrogen bond donor (HBD), hydrophobic (HY) and ring aromatic (RA) features based on the active site residues that are inside the sphere. These features were then clustered and the most representative features were selected and included in the pharmacophore model (Pharmacophore-A).",

A set of 7 structurally diverse aminopeptidase-N inhibitors were selected from literature [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23] as the training set to establish the common feature-based pharmacophores. The 2D chemical structures of selected molecules were draw manually using ChemDraw (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, MA) and subsequently exported to DS. All compounds were minimized to the closest local minimum based on the Charmm-like force field (DS). The HipHop module available in DS was employed to establish the pharmacophore. For the calculation setup, two ligand properties have to be specified. The first property is the principal value that defines the activity level of the molecule. A principal value of 2 indicates all chemical features of a reference compound are considered in building the pharmacophore space during model generation. The second ligand property to define is the MaxOmitFeat value that specifies how many features are allowed to miss for each compound. A MaxOmitFeat value of 1 allows that all but one of the features in the generated pharmacophore must map the molecule. Compounds 1\u20132 were assigned a principal value of 2 and a MaxOmitFeat value of 0, respectively, while compounds 3\u20137 were given principal and MaxOmitFeat values of 1. On the basis of an analysis of the chemical features present in the training set structures, hydrogen bond donor, hydrogen bond acceptor, and hydrophobic features were selected for this study. A maximum number of 255 and an energy threshold of 10 kcal/mol above the energy minimum for conformation searching were set for each compound by using Best conformation generation option. Among the 10 possible hypotheses returned, the top ranked hypothesis (Pharmacophore-B) was selected and validated by the G\u00fcner\u2013Henry (GH) scoring method.",

The 3D space and distance constraints of these features are shown in Fig. 2\nA. To further include additional information on size and shape of the bestatin-binding pocket of APN, a shape constraint was added to the chemical features of the pharmacophore Hypo1. As displayed in Fig. 3, the carbonyl group of bestatin that formed very important interactions with a zinc ion and Tyr477 in the binding site of APN overlaid the HBA feature of pharmacophore-A. In addition, the hydroxyl group of this molecule showing an ionic interaction with the zinc ion mapped one HBD feature, while the amino group that enabled considerable interactions with water molecules mapped the other HBD feature. The result indicated a fairly good mapping of bestatin on pharmacophore-A with the shape constraint. However, it is also implied that the pharmacophore-A may be utilized to only screen the compounds that have a chemical structure with functional groups closely related to those of bestatin. Thus a qualitative pharmacophore model (a common feature-based model or HipHop algorithm) was very necessary to identify structurally novel leads different from the bestatin.",

The E value for pharmacophore-B was 13.57 as it has retrieved 57 active compounds among 66 screened molecules from the total of 1100 compounds. The higher is the E value, the greater is the ability of a pharmacophore in identifying the active compounds. This validation results showed that both pharmacophore models A and B were very efficient for database screening. When GH score is higher than 0.7, the model is very good.
