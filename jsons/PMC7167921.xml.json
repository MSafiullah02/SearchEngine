This disease mostly affects young children less than 2 and is one of the most common reasons for presentation to the emergency departments (EDs) in infants.1 Every year, it causes over 300 000 ED visits in the USA and over 3.4 million hospitalizations worldwide.2, 3 Although the majority of children with bronchiolitis have a self\u2010limited mild or moderate illness, some of them may present with severe respiratory distress and require respiratory support.4 Numerous medications have been frequently used to manage acute bronchiolitis (eg, oxygen, hydration, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, antivirals, nasal decongestants, immunoglobulins), but only oxygen and hydration have been shown to demonstrably improve the condition of infants with bronchiolitis.5, 6, 7 Therefore, the optimal treatment regimen for the management of moderate and severe bronchiolitis (SB) remains unclear. In recent years, heated humidi\ufb01ed high\u2010\ufb02ow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) therapy has been introduced as a novel alternative method for the management of acute respiratory distress due to bronchiolitis.8\n",

Moreover, the 3 L\u00b7kg\u00b7min\u22121 flow rate was associated with a higher rate of discomfort and with a longer stay in the ICU. Similarly, our findings also supported these results and showed that using the increased flow rate in children with SB was not associated with treatment success. Although increasing the flow rate might generate more effective positive airway pressure, this hypothesis seemed realistic physiologically but not clinically. Also, it may be that the higher expiratory resistance imposed by a higher flow\u2010rate offsets any benefit of improving mean airway pressure.",
