            "text": "The merits of respiratory viral testing must be considered in the context of recent changes in the epidemiology and management of severe LRTIs. Bacteria have traditionally been viewed as the dominant pathogens in severe LRTIs. Indeed, rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) frequently approached 50% in historical studies.9, 10, 11 Several factors have altered this paradigm. Introduction of a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children in 2000, followed by a 13-valent conjugate vaccine in 2010, markedly reduced rates of severe pneumococcal infection, even in adults.12, 13 Declining rates of cigarette smoking, one of the greatest risk factors for pneumococcal infection in immunocompetent adults, further reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease.14 Finally, an aging population has resulted in an ever-increasing number of individuals particularly susceptible to severe viral infection. The elderly are up to 10 times more likely to develop viral pneumonia than younger adults, and they experience substantially higher morbidity and mortality with viral infection.5, 15, 16 Illustrative of these trends, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study, a population-based surveillance study in which the etiology of CAP was rigorously investigated in 2,259 adult patients, detected a bacterial pathogen in < 15% of patients, and only 5% were infected with S pneumoniae.5\n",

Slow and labor-intensive culture-based techniques have been largely replaced by increasingly sensitive diagnostic systems that pair nucleic acid amplification with multiplex technology, allowing multiple viruses to be tested on a single sample (discussed later in more detail). A number of studies have leveraged these advanced diagnostic techniques to better characterize the prevalence of viral infection in patients hospitalized with LRTI. In the CDC EPIC study, 23% of patients had evidence of a viral infection.5 Rhinovirus was the most frequently identified pathogen overall, found in 9% of patients. These results mirror findings of a meta-analysis that reported a combined incidence of respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients with CAP of 23%.17 Viruses seem to be just as common in patients admitted to the ICU (Fig 1\n). In a South Korean study of 198 patients with pneumonia admitted to the ICU, > 35% had a viral pathogen identified (of which 24% were rhinovirus).18 Other studies in ICU patients have reported viral infection rates between 18% and 41%.19, 20, 21\n",

Quantitative PCR technology can be applied to either traditional PCR or RT-PCR platforms. As with standard PCR, quantitative real-time PCR is highly sensitive and specific.

Studies comparing the results of respiratory viral testing in patients with CAP and asymptomatic control subjects have found viral carriage rates of only 2% in the asymptomatic adult control subjects.5, 59 However, in a recent study of patients admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure (where the presence or absence of infection was determined according to admitting Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II diagnoses), 17% of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for reasons other than a severe acute respiratory infection had a viral pathogen identified by using multiplex RT-PCR.21 Although these results may indicate that the admitting diagnoses misclassified a large number of truly infected patients, they may also show that viral carriage is common in acutely ill patients. Importantly, viral test results from the upper and lower airway were frequently discordant. Twenty percent of patients with a severe respiratory infection had a viral pathogen identified only in the upper airway, whereas 29% had a virus identified exclusively on tracheobronchial aspirate. These findings highlight the challenge of using a respiratory viral test result from the upper airway to rule in or out clinically significant lower airway infection. Finally, 25% of patients admitted with a severe respiratory tract infection had evidence of bacterial co-infection. Clinicians may understandably be reluctant to discontinue antibiotics even if viral test results are positive for fear of undertreating a mixed infection.",

This concept is particularly true for multiplex viral detection when specific antiviral treatment is available for only a few detectable viral pathogens. The decision to administer antibiotics to patients with severe LRTI depends on numerous factors, including a clinician\u2019s pretest suspicion for bacterial infection, the results of diagnostic testing (eg, studies have found an abnormal chest radiograph to be associated with continued antibiotic use54, 56, 60), and a patient\u2019s clinical course. As noted earlier, the clinical significance of a positive or negative respiratory viral test result is often unclear, and thus it is understandable and perhaps advisable for clinicians not to use the results of testing as the sole determinant of antibiotic administration. Studies in other settings have shown that overreliance on antibiotics persists despite clear recommendations from consensus guidelines61 and focused interventions to reduce overuse.62 Given the pervasive and recalcitrant nature of antibiotic overuse, a multifaceted approach will surely be required to effectively solve this problem.",

The pathogenicity of non-influenza viruses remains a source of debate. Rhinovirus is probably the most cited example. Rhinovirus clearly causes pneumonia in children with viremia, and detection in pleural fluid supports its pathogenicity.
