            "text": "When AIDS was first reported in a handful of homosexual men in the United States in June 1981, it was not initially clear whether an infection triggered the loss of CD4+ T cells that resulted in immunodeficiency. Other possible causes were proposed, such as recreational drugs or exposure to different human leukocyte antigens from multiple sexual partners. With the observation of AIDS in injecting drug users, and in recipients of blood and blood products, it became evident that a transmissible agent was to blame. In fact, thanks to superb epidemiological investigations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, by early 1983 we already knew much about the risk factors associated with AIDS; all that was missing was the infective agent itself. Various microbes were mooted, including DNA viruses, RNA viruses, and a fungus secreting an immunosuppressive molecule like cyclosporin.",

His group had recently discovered the first two human retroviruses (HTLV-I and -II). Although I studied these retroviruses, kindly provided by Gallo, I did not consider a retrovirus to be a strong candidate. I thought that a fragile, enveloped virus would not survive the preparation of clotting factors used to treat hemophilia and favored a nonenveloped virus such as a parvovirus\u2014how wrong I was! Then, in the same issue of Science in which Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi et al. (1983) reported \u201clymphadenopathy virus\u201d (LAV), Gallo and Max Essex published papers indicating that approximately 10% of AIDS and lymphadenopathy patients were infected with HTLV-I. This was indeed the case, but not the cause; it was analogous to finding HSV-II in a proportion of women with cervical cancer.",

She realized that an AIDS agent that causes CD4 T cell depletion in vivo might well be cytopathic in vitro. She found that the supernatant contained a filterable agent that could transfer the killing effect to T cells cultured from healthy donors. Moreover, the supernatant contained reverse transcriptase activity (the hallmark of a retrovirus) and the infected cells were bristling with budding virus particles, although they did not have a morphology typical of oncogenic retroviruses (Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi et al., 1983).",

Montagnier sent us a virus sample, but we could not propagate it successfully. Later, he suggested trying a laboratory-adapted, more \u201cvirulent\u201d stock of virus, and on February 29, 1984 Rachanee Cheingsong brought it from the Pasteur Institute to London. Within 2 weeks, it was producing enormous titers in the CEM T cell line, and these cells became the source of antigen for the Elavia and Wellcozyme diagnostic tests. With hindsight, we know that the first sample we received was the CCR5-tropic HIV isolate Bru, and the high-titer stock was the CXCR4-tropic isolate Lai (Wain-Hobson et al., 1991); Lai was also propagated by Mika Popovic in Gallo's laboratory as HTLV-IIIB.",

Thanks to pre-existing knowledge of retrovirus replication, antiretroviral therapy trials were undertaken in 1986 by Sam Broder and colleagues at the NIH of azidothymidine (Zidovudine), which acts as a chain terminator of reverse transcription. However, owing to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant virus, treatment only became successful when drug combinations were introduced a decade later.",

The discovery of HTLV-I came 18 months before the beautiful work of Isao Miyoshi and Yorio Hinuma in Japan, who showed its causal link to adult T cell leukemia. On the other hand, had the Committee been minded to recognize the discovery of human oncogenic viruses, Gallo and Sir Anthony Epstein (who detected EBV in 1964) might have joined zur Hausen. The Committee stated that zur Hausen \u201cwent against current dogma and postulated that HPV caused cervical cancer\u201d (although Orth had proposed the same).

Following their first HIV-1 isolate from a patient with lymphadenopathy (Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi et al., 1983), they published on further isolates from AIDS patients (Vilmer et al., 1984) and noted their resemblance to a lentivirus (Montagnier et al., 1984) before Gallo and Levy reported their findings.

The 1902 Prize recognized Ronald Ross for demonstrating in 1898 that avian malaria can be transmitted by mosquitoes but astonishingly (in retrospect) omitted Gianni-Battista Grassi in Italy who contemporaneously identified the mosquito vectors of human malaria.

Previously, Loeffler had discovered the diphtheria bacterium and precisely enunciated the postulates that he ascribed to his mentor, Robert Koch. I wonder about Sir Christopher Andrewes, who identified human influenza virus in 1933. Alick Isaacs, like Proust and Kafka, sadly died too soon after his and Jean Lindermann's discovery of interferon in 1957 to gain recognition. This finding of an innate antiviral response was also the first discovery of a cytokine, long before the interleukins. Perhaps the most notable achievement in overcoming infectious disease during the Nobel era was the eradication of smallpox in 1977 by the WHO team led by Donald Henderson; it cannot qualify for a Nobel Prize in Medicine because it was not a discovery, so a Peace Prize would be apt.",
