The identify-isolate-inform framework introduced by the CDC during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak can serve as a basic framework upon which further planning for the evaluation of PUIs for any HHCD, not just EVD, and can be used in any setting [7]. In this chapter, we will discuss features of PUI definitions and their implementation by healthcare providers, the various clinical settings that may be used for evaluation of the PUI, an approach to PUIs using the identify-isolate-inform framework, the specific evaluation and management methods that may be used in evaluating PUIs, and the clinical and operational challenges encountered during evaluation and management. We will conclude with a look to the ongoing challenges in PUI evaluation and areas where future advances in knowledge and policy are needed.",

Therefore, in such conditions, public health and medical authorities initially develop case definitions to attempt to identify all of the suspect cases in the community according to standardized and current knowledge of the disease. A case definition is a set of uniform criteria used to define a disease for public health surveillance, and the details of the case definition usually form the foundation of the definition of the PUI [8]. Case definitions include the demographic risk factors of persons who may have the disease (age, sex, etc.), the locations where exposure may be occurring, the length of the incubation period of the disease, and the symptoms associated with the disease [12]. A case definition is not equivalent to diagnostic criteria used for a particular disease. Instead, a case definition is intended to ensure maximum sensitivity for disease detection and not necessarily for maximum specificity.",

PUI definitions may also be complex and include multiple combinations of risk factors and symptoms to define levels of risk or severity of disease. Symptoms and risk factors may be added to or removed from the formal definition as this process evolves. For example, following two cases of MERS that were diagnosed in healthcare workers from Saudi Arabia traveling to the United States, CDC altered its guidance to emphasize testing for MERS in persons with mild symptoms but with strong epidemiologic risk factors, including particularly prior healthcare exposure [13]. In addition, travel to selected countries or regions may also be included or excluded as a risk factor for disease as an outbreak evolves. During 2015, after the emergence of a nosocomial outbreak of MERS in South Korea, this country was briefly included in the list of countries in the MERS PUI definition and then was subsequently removed when the outbreak ended. When the case definition changes rapidly, information that was recently shared with staff in lectures, webinars, or emails can quickly become obsolete. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for printed and posted PUI criteria to remain in use long after the content is outdated.",

First, well-placed, clearly written signage in public areas, ambulatory waiting rooms, and ED settings should direct patients to immediately notify specific staff (depending on specific location) if they have either a relevant clinical syndrome (i.e., fever and a cough or fever and a rash) on arrival or if they have traveled internationally during a specified period. The precise time frame for international travel, corresponding to specific infectious incubation periods, will differ based on infection; however a window of travel within the prior 3 weeks will capture the incubation periods of MERS, SARS, novel avian influenza, and EVD and other viral hemorrhagic fevers, which simplifies the message to patients.",

It is not realistic to expect all ambulatory clinics to stock and for staff to maintain proficiency in the correct and consistent use of PPE required in the long-term care of patients for specific infectious diseases such as EVD; however, in the setting of a clinically stable patient, staff should be expected to safely don and doff PPE appropriate for limited patient contact. This may include impermeable gown, N95 respirator, gloves, and face shield. All personnel who wear PPE in this setting must have been previously properly trained to do so.",

Some hospitals choose to evaluate their PUIs in an ED treatment area, while others use a separate, specialized, inpatient, or other isolation area. When a site within the ED is chosen, there are a few questions that are especially worthy of consideration for planning purposes. First, is the room appropriate to support the care of a patient\u2014is the room AII and is there a private bathroom (or other appropriate individual toileting procedure) available? Second, does the location of the room (or rooms, if multiple rooms will be used) support both safe entry of clean clinical personnel into the room and safe exit for contaminated clinical personnel? Additionally, does the space have a clearly demarcated area for doffing of PPE? One advantageous practice that has been observed is to select a room (or to modify an existing room) that has a separate entrance and exit, so that contaminated staff will not traverse the clean entrance to the room when exiting. Third, is the room in a location within the ED where its use for evaluation of the PUI will not excessively disrupt other ED activities? Evaluation of the PUI can be a labor- and material-intensive process, creating congestion as well as visible distractions for other patients and staff. Therefore, it is advisable, when possible, to choose a room to evaluate PUIs that is located away from the center of the ED to minimize interference to the other important ongoing ED activities and use physical barriers when possible to reduce disruption to routine care. Some facilities plan to keep PUIs in their ED room only until the initial assessment and first round of testing is completed, while other facilities plan to keep their PUIs in the ED room until the diagnosis has been definitively ruled in or out, which can potentially take several days (up to 3 days in the case of EVD).",

Prior to the 2014\u20132016 EVD outbreak, federal guidance stated that all lab testing on patients suspected to have certain highly infectious pathogens (such as EVD) could only be performed in a biosafety level (BSL)-4 laboratory, while most hospitals only have BSL-2 laboratory facilities. Although the CDC provided guidance during the EVD epidemic that was intended to permit appropriate clinical testing outside of BSL-4 labs, these changes were not accepted by many. Many laboratory leaders were concerned about staff safety and impact on use of equipment for routine laboratory studies after processing a sample that could contain EVD [18]. Therefore, clinical and laboratory leaders must jointly decide on the basic menu of laboratory tests to support and to ensure adequate clinical care of the patient with the resources available. Some hospitals have elected to rely on bedside point-of-care testing devices to support much of this need, as the devices eliminate the need to utilize the large, automated laboratory machines. Because malaria is commonly in the differential diagnosis for many PUIs for EVD or other viral hemorrhagic fever, it is important that the hospital have a mechanism for testing for malaria as part of the basic clinical evaluation. To limit the potential spread of biological contamination outside of the patient\u2019s room, special procedures must be developed to properly clean and package blood and other biological samples before they leave the room for transport to the hospital lab. Testing for the pathogen of concern is likely to be coordinated through the state public health laboratory. While commercial assays are available for some of these pathogens, public health laboratories will assist in confirmation of the diagnosis or excluding the diagnosis. Hospital staff must be trained and certified in packaging of specimens for transport to state laboratories.",

The decision about whether to offer additional advanced imaging services, such as CT or MRI, depends on variables such as the specific infectivity and transmission of the infectious disease for which the patient is being evaluated. If there is concern about the hospital\u2019s ability to offer such imaging services, a multidisciplinary committee, such as the one used to determine the medical and surgical procedures that can be offered, should be utilized.",
