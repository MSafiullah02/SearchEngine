It first appeared in China in December 2019, and has already affected more than 100 countries around the world.1 Thailand is the second country in the world where the disease was first detected on 13th January 2020.2 Until 12th March 2020, after 90 days of disease existence, 70 official cases of COVID-19 have been reported. The main high-risk group to get directly affected by COVID-19 are those workers who come in contact with international passengers at the immigration counters. Generally, the immigration police are the first to come in direct contact with the passengers at the international immigration posts. The immigration check process includes inspection of the passenger as well as their passports, which takes about 5 min per person. During the immigrations checks, close contact occurs between the immigration police and the passengers. The contaminated passport might also be a neglected source of contamination.",

The infection occurs at the rate of 0.00008 case/100 immigration police/day.

Apart from the prevailing coronavirus disease, the immigrant police are exposed to many other transmissible diseases (such as influenza etc.) which are transmitted through close work contact. Such immigration police should be provided with effective preventive tools. It is necessary to promote recognition of the immigrant police to follow specific infectious control precautions. These procedures can be routinely undertaken during their duty hours.",
