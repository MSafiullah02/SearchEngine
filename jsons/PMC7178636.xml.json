Delirium can occur for any person, with those who are older, have advanced illness, and/or prior cognitive impairment most at risk [5]. The prevalence of delirium in patients with advanced cancer in oncology and palliative care settings is higher than that in most other settings, including geriatrics [1, 6\u20139]. A systematic review of palliative care patients (with 98.9% of participants with advanced cancer), reported delirium incidence rates between 3% and 45%. Delirium prevalence ranged from 13.3% to 42.3% at admission to hospital, and 25% to 62% during admission. Delirium prevalence increased up to 88% in the hours to days before death [1].",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of delirium is poorly understood, and largely hypothetical. Current hypotheses include: neuronal ageing, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuroendocrine dysregulation, disruption to the circadian rhythm, and neurotransmitter dysregulation [10, 11]. A reduction in glucose metabolism seen in people with delirium is a model with developing evidence [12, 13]. Collectively, the biological correlates of delirium are referred to as \u2018delirium biomarkers\u2019. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease [14]. Biomarkers are most commonly studied to investigate their correlation with a disease in order to better understand its underlying pathophysiology, and subsequently inform prevention and treatment strategies for that disease. A challenge for the field of delirium research is that correlation may exist between biomarkers of delirium and those of the patient\u2019s disease or injury which placed them at increased risk of delirium, or which precipitated it (for example sepsis or hip fracture). Such correlation should be factored into delirium biomarker research, yet rarely has been. Better understanding of the interplay between delirium pathophysiology and that of correlated conditions and diseases, for example, cancer (the focus of this review), is crucial to develop more effective prevention and treatment of delirium.",

The findings of this systematic review suggest that categorization along these lines is less understood in delirium. For example, there is evidence to show that conditions such as sepsis and hip fracture cause changes in inflammatory markers [177, 178], however, there is little evidence about whether delirium self-propagates. Some animal model data in delirium suggests that there might be a direct impact of inflammatory markers on brain dysfunction [179]. To our knowledge there was no published relationship between tumor markers and neurological brain dysfunction. Although clinical evidence suggests long term impacts on brain function, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood, and biomarkers to measure this are also unclear.",

Likewise, Pfister et al. (2008) found differences in CRP, s100 calcium binding protein B (s100B) and cortisol in patients with sepsis-associated delirium, compared to non-sepsis associated delirium. In two studies, delirium in stroke was examined [25, 92] but these studies did not identify differences in cortisol [92] or TNF- \u03b1, IL- 1\u03b2, IL-18, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Neuron specific enolase (NSE) [25] between patients who developed delirium after stroke compared to those who did not develop delirium.

The quality assessment in this systematic review found that many of the included studies were of poor methodological quality, inadequately reported, or were influenced by potential confounding factors. A potential barrier to the complete understanding of delirium pathophysiology is the lack of guidelines for conducting and reporting delirium biomarker studies. Results from this review indicate that the absence of such guidelines has likely impeded the quality of individual studies and the overall quality of this critical field of delirium research. Reporting guidelines for delirium biomarker research are an essential step to improving methodological and reporting rigor, and will increase the potential for synthesis of future studies through meta-analyses.",

The top five most commonly studies biomarkers in this review were inflammatory biomarkers, namely, CRP, IL-6, TNF- \u03b1, IL-10 and IL-8. The challenge with inflammatory markers is that they are non-specific and the inflammatory pathways are similar to those implicated in other conditions such as sepsis and depression [181, 182]. Likewise, of the six delirium studies where there was concomitant cancer, it is very difficult to determine whether those biomarkers found were related to the cancer or the delirium itself, considering alterations in inflammatory pathways are implicated in both. Therefore, future delirium biomarker studies need to be prospectively evaluated and take into account and assess robustly other active co-morbidities such as cancer that could plausibly impact on the pathophysiological and/or biological findings. Similarly, future cancer biomarker studies must also take into account how delirium may clinically or biologically confound biomarker studies in cancer, considering the high prevalence of delirium in this population. Of the six delirium studies with cancer, three did not report the type of cancer, and of the remaining three studies, none were primary brain tumours or brain metastases. Understanding the spread of brain cancer is important in delirium studies, and is an important consideration for future delirium biomarker studies.",

Where studies only undertook univariate analysis, it is uncertain whether any observed changes in biomarkers were related to the delirium itself, or whether these changes may have been lost when adjusted for confounding factors (such as prior cognitive impairment) in a multivariate analysis. Furthermore, there is likely to be a higher proportion of participants with both delirium and cancer in both groups of studies for which this clinical information was not assessed or that were not reported. Key methodological issues which need to be addressed in future delirium studies include adjusting for confounders such as age, gender, concurrent medication, comorbidities, prior cognitive impairment, frailty and other neurological conditions. These clinical covariates must also be clearly defined and justified. Assay procedures ought to be reported in detail, including a detailed protocol of the reagents/kits used, repeatability assessments, methods of preservation and storage, assay validity, sensitivity limits of the assay and a scoring and reporting protocol. The timing of the assay is crucial in delirium studies, and the fluctuating pathophysiological processes occurring during delirium, after delirium resolution, and in those who have not yet developed delirium, must be taken into consideration, and be separated in future studies. More standardised and detailed methods of delirium biomarker studies is a crucial step in carrying out future subgroup analyses within this cohort and improving the overall understanding of delirium pathophysiology.",
