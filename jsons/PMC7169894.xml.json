Glycerin has been used to fix viruses for decades, propylene glycol has been shown to inactivate viruses and ethanol is widely used as a viral disinfectant. Ethanol is also added to increase the solubility of some of the polar species. Ammonium chloride, which can have a negative impact on the viral replication rate, is included at low levels [5]. Fatty acids including stearic, oleic, linoleic and/or arachidonic acids are included at <1% of the total mass. The state (s, l) and solubility of the fatty acids in the solvents must be considered. It has been demonstrated that specific fatty acids can impact the replication rate of the coronavirus [6]. Human serum albumin provides a source of amino acids for the virus. When suspended in the solution, ethanol denatures the structure allowing it to decompose into its basic building blocks with less effort. ssDNA is added for its building blocks, which can be utilized by the virus. The two macromolecules comprise no more than 1% of the total mass. Fructose or glucose are included as an energy source for the infected cells, increasing their metabolic processes along with the uptake rate of the drug that attacks the viral population in an infected cell at a mass <1%. Hydroxychloroquine was tested at levels as high as 6% of the bulk solvent mass. In a typical formulation, the hydroxychloroquine or bryostatin extract was 2\u20134% of the bulk solvent mass and the other species a maximum of 3% of the solvent mass. Hydroxychloroquine can be replaced wth chloroquine or Remdesivir in the evaporation experiment.",

The monosaccharides provide additional localized energy for the cell. The protein and nucleic acids suspended in the solvent provide building blocks for the viral replication process. The goal is to maintain or accelerate viral replication improving the efficacy of the drug during this vulnerable phase. At the same time, the fatty acids, ethanol and glycerin provide antagonistic activity toward the virus at the molecular level. In the vaporization process, droplets composed of glycerin and propylene glycol can be in the tens to several hundreds of nanometers diameter range [7]. These nanoparticles will rapidly release their bioactive species in the lungs owing to the high surface-area:volume ratio. The multitude of agents potentially interacting with a virus in a short timespan presents a unique conundrum for its replication and survival. The inhalation approach enables lower doses to be administered.",

Bryostatin has been shown to have various levels of efficacy against different types of cancers 8, 9, neurological diseases 10, 11 and antiviral activity 12, 13. A protein kinase C modulator in medicinal applications, its limitations in large-scale studies are cost and availability. Bryostatin is naturally produced by marine bacteria having a symbiotic relationship with the bryozoan Bugula neritina. Bryostatin provides a chemical defense against predators seeking the Bugula larvae [14]. Although the interaction between viral and bacterial species in the world\u2019s oceans is a developing field, it is estimated that marine viruses outnumber marine bacteria by ratios that range from 20:1 to 50:1. This suggests that marine bacterium can interact with multiple viral species and would need a broad-spectrum antiviral defense to survive. Marine creatures such as Beluga whales [15] and bottlenose dolphins [16] are infected with coronaviruses and their defense systems could involve symbiotic bacterium that produce a small molecule(s) with antiviral properties.",

There have been 20 bryostatin structures isolated from Bugula and published that have different R1 and R2 constituents. There are probably many more variations of the bryophan ring in nature. In analysis of marine extracts, there is a complex mix of structures that can be correlated with the bryophan ring having differences in the R1 and R2 structures. Simple marine creatures, such as fire coral, use complex poisons for different survival tasks [17]. This mixture has been noted in the literature by several groups 18, 19. The complex mixtures extracted from Bugula suggest the bacterial defense system is a multipronged system and not a single structure.",
