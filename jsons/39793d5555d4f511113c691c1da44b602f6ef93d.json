Comparing with this national data, the current crosssectional study found that much higher prevalence of depression ( COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. These findings are consistent with the previous studies' that exposing public health emergency can cause public mental health problems, such as Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes [17] , 2014 Ebola Outbreak [7, 18] , and SARS [19] . Social media is one of main channels updating the COVID-19 information [3] . This study also found that 82.0% of participants frequently expose them to social media, and frequently SME associated high odds of anxiety and CDA, which is consistent with previous studies [11] . there may be two reasons explaining the association between frequently SME and mental health. During COVID-19 outbreak, disinformation and false reports about the COVID-19 have bombarded social media and stoked unfounded fears among many netizens [20] , which may confuse people and harm people's mental health [9] . Besides, many citizens expressed their negative feelings, such as fear, worry, nervous, anxiety et al. on social media, which are contagious social network [21, 22] . So, WHO's 'infodemics' team is working hand in glove with countries' communications department to deliver information to a broader public audience [23] . Finally, we also found that SME was not different between participants from Hubei province and others, but the formers faced higher odds of anxiety. It indicated that participants from Hubei province-the infectious focus directly expose to public health emergency, and may suffer more mental health problemes [17, 19] . Compared with the control measures taken by other cities, Wuhan have sealed off the city from all outside contact to stop the spread of the COVID-19.
