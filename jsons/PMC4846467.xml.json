The RSV+ and rhinovirus+ categories include all other viral coinfections except RSV/rhinovirus. In sensitivity analyses, we assessed different virus combinations, stratified by age (<6 months, 6-11.9 months, \u226512 months), and restricted the analysis to children with first-time wheezing. Data were analyzed using \u03c72 tests for unadjusted analyses and multivariable logistic regression for adjusted analyses. For the multivariable analysis, we examined the association between virus detection and receiving corticosteroids in both the emergency department (ED) and during the hospitalization; a composite outcome that only included children prescribed corticosteroids by either of 2 different care teams (ie, ED and inpatient). Data are presented as proportions, medians with IQRs, and ORs with 95% CIs. All analyses were performed using Stata 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).",

The median age was 4 months (IQR, 2-9 months), 1311 (59%) were male, and 539 (24%) were black. Among these 2207 children, 1302 (59%) were RSV+, 287 (13%) had RSV/rhinovirus coinfection, and 277 (13%) were rhinovirus+. There were 341 (15%) children with non-RSV and nonrhinovirus infections or no identified viral infections that were excluded from the current analysis. As shown in Table I\n, children positive for rhinovirus were more likely to be older, have a history of wheezing, and have a history of eczema. No differences were observed with respect to parental history of asthma. Children with rhinovirus were also more likely to receive systemic corticosteroids in the ED and during the current hospitalization. In a multivariable model controlling for age, sex, race, history of wheezing, history of eczema, treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in the past week, and clustering by site, children with rhinovirus were more likely to be prescribed systemic corticosteroids in the ED and the hospital than children who were RSV+ (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.62-3.78; P < .001). Children with RSV/rhinovirus coinfections did not have a higher odds of being prescribed corticosteroids than children who were RSV+ (OR 1.43; 95% CI 0.83-2.48; P = .20). Results did not materially change in sensitivity analyses comparing different combinations of viruses, including RSV-only, rhinovirus-only, or when stratifying by age (<6 months, 6-11.9 months, \u226512 months), or restricting the analytic cohort to children with first time wheezing (Table II; available at www.jpeds.com).",

Compared with children with RSV-associated bronchiolitis, children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis were more likely to be older and have a prior history of wheezing and eczema. Furthermore, in the multivariable model, children hospitalized with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis were more likely to be treated with systemic corticosteroids even after controlling for age, sex, race, history of wheezing, eczema, and inhaled corticosteroid use. This differential treatment of children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis by clinicians at academic medical centers across the US is an implicit acknowledgement by these treating clinicians that they consider bronchiolitis to be a heterogeneous respiratory illness. The next step is to determine if there are identifiable subgroups of children with bronchiolitis (eg, rhinovirus positive, history of wheezing) who may respond differently to medications (eg, albuterol, systemic corticosteroids) or who may need closer long-term follow-up given their potentially higher risk of having asthma.",

To date, many of the large-scale bronchiolitis medication trials have required children to be age <12 months and have no history of wheezing.3 Based on the present data, these inclusion criteria may have created fairly homogenous study populations of children with RSV bronchiolitis. Although RSV is the most common viral etiology of severe bronchiolitis and the results of these well conducted studies remain valid, the present data in combination with other reports2, 6, 7, 8 suggest that these large-scale studies probably should be repeated in children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis. A change in practice for this subgroup would affect the short-term outcomes of an estimated 25 000 US children age <2 years hospitalized annually with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis and many more world-wide.1\n",
