This is the first study to report that diabetic patients contracting COVID-19 have more severe inflammation and higher mortality [6], and that inflammations markers such as serum ferritin level, CRP level, and ESR in COVID-19 cases and the coagulation factor Fbg were positively correlated with HbA1c level, while SaO2 was negatively correlated with HbA1c level. Even in patients with only elevated HbA1c level and no diabetes, the levels of inflammation markers and Fbg were also significantly increased (Fig. 1, P < 0.05). However, little is known about the mechanism concerning the increase in the levels of inflammation markers and HbA1c level in case of COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that diabetes not only causes epithelial dysfunction of pulmonary cilia, increased vascular system permeability, alveolar epithelial damage, and alveolar collapse but also contributes to abnormal immune system function [7], [8]. Similarly, in severely ill COVID-19 patients, the lungs, spleen, and lymph node structures are damaged, and lymphocyte counts are reduced [9]. Both diabetes and COVID-19 may synergistically damage the immune and respiratory systems. Further, diabetic patients have more comorbidities due to which there is more target organ damage; this together with COVID-19 leads to a more severe inflammation, hypercoagulability, an even low oxygenation, and eventually higher mortality.",

Previous studies have reported that some viruses can directly cause pancreatic \u03b2-cell damage [11], [12], and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor has higher expression in pancreatic endocrine tissues than in exocrine tissues [13]. Autopsy showed that although a small number of islet cells were degenerated in pancreatic tissue, while immunohistochemical analysis and polymerase chain reaction tests did not detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic islet cells [9], thus indicating that there is insufficient evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2-induced damage of islet cells. Levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, CRP, serum amyloid A, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 have been shown to be increased in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. IL-1\u03b2 can cause islet \u03b2 cell dysfunction and apoptosis, and the levels of these factors can be reduced by lifestyle-related changes and weight loss, which suggests that inflammatory markers may be involved in islet \u03b2 cell damage and insulin resistance [14]. Inflammatory factors released in response to SARS-CoV-2 may also be involved in islet \u03b2-cell damage and insulin resistance resulting in abnormal glucose metabolism. In our study, patients had 14 (IQR 10.0\u201317.8) days from the onset of symptoms to admission. Abnormal glucose metabolism for a long period of time may cause an increase in HBV1c level.",

Third, after 3 years of follow-up of SARS patients, Yang et al. found that the fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, and insulin levels of the SARS group and their paired healthy non-SARS siblings were similar, suggesting that SARS-CoV-related islet damage and insulin resistance is for a short duration.
