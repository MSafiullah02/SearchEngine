            "text": "Chloroquine (CQ) is a synthetic form of quinine (derived from the bark of cinchona tree) and is widely used as an anti-malarial since the last seventy years. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has an extra hydroxyl group at the end of the side chain and is commonly used in the management of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Both these drugs have shown to have some anti-viral properties and may be useful in treating patients with COVID-19. Both CQ and HCQ interfere with the glycosylation of ACE-2 receptor, which is essential for the viral entry [49, 50]. Both the drugs are a weak base, and they interfere with the acidification of lysosome. This interferes with the pH-dependent endosome mediated viral entry [49, 50]. Both the drugs inhibit activation of cells by MAP kinase (P38 MAP kinase [49, 50] and inhibit post-translational modification of M proteins, thereby altering viral assembly and budding [49, 50]. Also, both the drugs are immunomodulatory agents and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines [49, 50]. Compared to CQ, HCQ has a better in-vitro potency (7.6 times more potent), safety profile and lesser drug-drug interactions. HCQs have high accumulation in cells and long elimination half-life.",

Recent studies have shown that CQ is also active in-vitro against SARS-CoV-2 [57]. CQ and HCQ decreased viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a concentration dependant manner. HCQ exhibits superior in-vitro anti-viral effect in comparison to CQ when the drug is added before viral challenge [58]. In-vitro synergistic effect of HCQ and azithromycin has been demonstrated in a recent study [59].",

            "text": "Although in-vitro studies demonstrate the activity of CQ against SARS-CoV-2, this does not guarantee simultaneous in-vivo activity. For example, CQ was found to be effective in inhibiting replication of dengue, chikungunya and influenza in-vitro, but failed to show similar effects in in-vivo studies [60\u201362]. Preliminary reports from China in which 100 patients were given CQ showed early defervescence of fever and improvement in radiological findings. No serious adverse events were noted [63]. A French clinical trial of 36 PCR confirmed patients showed that virological clearance on Day 6 was significantly higher in HCQ arm compared to the control group (Table 1) [3]. In another study of 62 patients (31- standard treatment, 31- additional HCQ) with pneumonia associated with COVID-19 from China, additional HCQ for 5 days resulted in earlier remission of fever and cough [64]. Patients with severe/ critical illness were, however, excluded from the study. In a multi-centric open labelled randomized controlled trial of 150 patients from China, there was no difference in virological conversion rate or improvement in clinical symptoms at day 10. However, the HCQ arm showed a better clinical response in posthoc analysis when the effect of other anti-antivirals was removed (Table 1) [4]. A small French study of 11 patients by Molina et al. failed to show beneficial effects (early clearance of virus) of combining HCQ and azithromycin in patients with COVID-19 [65]. In another multi-centric retrospective study of 181 patients with COVID pneumonia from France, there was no difference in worse clinical outcomes between the two arms (Table 1) [5]. In a quasi-randomized controlled trial by Barbosa et al., of the 63 recruited patients, 32 received HCQ while 31 received standard support. Higher respiratory support requirement was noted in the HCQ group after 5 days of therapy [66]. In a retrospective study on 368 veterans from the United States of America, risk of death was found to be higher in those patients who received HCQ alone compared to no HCQ. No difference in requirement of ventilation was found between HCQ and no HCQ group (Table 1) [6].",

However, the French group used a dosing regimen of 200 mg thrice daily for 10 days [3]. Drug-drug interactions and co-morbidities (pregnancy, chronic renal impairment) should be considered while defining the doses. Administration with food may be helpful as the bioavailability is increased with food. Although some experts are recommending routine use of CQ and HCQ as prophylaxis, there is no evidencing supporting this recommendation. CQ and HCQs have been successfully used for malarial prophylaxis, but similar results have not been observed for viral infections [61]. CQ has a narrow therapeutic window, but when appropriate dosing is used, it is relatively well tolerated. Compared to CQ, HCQs are better tolerated. Minor side effects include diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Toxic doses may lead to life-threatening cardiomyopathy, macular retinopathy and neurotoxicity.",

Recently, laboratory studies have suggested its role as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent [68]. In influenza, it inhibits the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin, whereas it interferes with viral morphogenesis in rotavirus [68]. It can also limit virus entry, viral release and cell-to-cell transmission. It can also interfere with host-regulated pathways and can inhibit/ suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF alpha [69, 70].",

In another study, the addition of LPV/r to IFN B in MERS CoV infected cell lines did not enhance the activity of IFN B alone [85]. LPV/r was also found to have activity against Human coronavirus 229 E [32]. No in-vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 has been reported as of now. In humanized transgenic mice, LPV/r plus IFN B was not able to reduce the viral load of MERS CoV [85]. However, in non-human primate models (marmosets) infected with MERS CoV, LPV/r was able to reduce viral load and improve clinical progress [86]. In a study on health care workers exposed to MERS, lower rates of infection were noticed when they were given post-exposure prophylaxis of ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days [87]. In patients of SARS-CoV-1 without ARDS, the addition of LPV/r to ribavirin and corticosteroids resulted in better clinical outcomes when compared to historical controls who received ribavirin and corticosteroids [84]. In a retrospective matched cohort study, LPV/r resulted in better clinical outcomes in patient with SARS [88]. Small case series have reported apparent benefit with LPV/r. Ten patients with COVID-19 were given sustained LPV/r with good outcomes [16]. In another study, 17 patients who received oral LPV/r alone, 52.9% of the patients showed clearance of viraemia on day 14 [16]. However, an open labelled trial of 199 COVID-19 patients did not show any decrease in time to clinical improvement, mortality or viral load after addition of LPV/r (Table 1) [7]. Although this trial failed to show any benefit of LPV/r, it can be argued that patients had already developed lung injury at the time of enrolment. The median time of enrolment in this study was 13 days [7]. It is postulated that since the viraemia is present in the early part of the illness and the lung involvement is a result of cytokine release and immune response, the drug may be effective when given in the early part of the illness. In the study by Chan et al. on patients with SARS-CoV-1, LPV/r was beneficial when given in the early part of illness but did not have any significant impact when it was given as a salvage or rescue [88].",

Tocilizumab acts against the soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors and inhibits the inflammatory action of IL-6 [108]. Pulmonary injury and ARDS has been postulated to be a result of hyper-inflammatory state in the latter half of the illness in COVID-19 due to increase in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 [109, 110]. Similar studies from patients with influenza have shown that high IL-6 levels are associated with severity [111]. However, mice models show that IL-6 is also useful to prevent virus-induced neutrophil death and is a useful host response in early infection. Therefore, it is imperative to understand that molecules such as tocilizumab can only be used only in patients with severe disease when cytokine release syndrome is suspected as evidenced by an increased IL-6. There are no published reports of the use of tocilizumab in SARS and MERS. Preliminary case series have shown good outcomes with tocilizumab (400 mg) in 21 patients with severe or critical COVID-19. All the patients either improved (19/21) or were improving (2/21) at the time of reporting [112]. In another study of 30 patients, it was found that the use of tocilizumab was associated with lesser ICU admission and requirement of mechanical ventilation when compared to controls (Table 1) [9].",

Initial results of compassionate use of remdesivir are encouraging but the drug needs to be evaluated in well-designed randomized trials before it can be used routinely. Tocilizumab has been proposed for use in severe or life-threatening cases of cytokine release syndrome based on studies with very small sample size which have shown good results.
