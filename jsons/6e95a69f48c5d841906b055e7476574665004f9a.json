Social (physical) distancing is a key non-pharmacologic control measure to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2, but high-level adherence is needed. Using daily travel distance and stay-at-home time derived from large-scale anonymous mobile phone location data provided by Descartes Labs and SafeGraph, we quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates have been followed in the U.S. and its effect on growth of COVID-19 cases. The correlation between the COVID-19 growth rate and travel distance decay rate and dwell time at home change rate was -0.586 (95% CI: -0.742\u223c-0.370) and 0.526 (95% CI: 0.293\u223c0.700), 1 arXiv:2004.11430v1 [cs.SI] 23 Apr 2020 respectively. Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.04\u223c6.86 days to 3.66\u223c30.29 days after social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with mechanistic epidemic prediction models. Social distancing mandates reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are followed.",

As of April 11, 2020, there had been 492,416 total confirmed cases and 18,559 total deaths in the U.S. according to the reports of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1) . People are still witnessing widespread community transmission of the COVID-19 all over the world. Presently, there is neither a vaccine nor pharmacologic agent found to reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Thus, the effects of nonpharmacological epidemic control and intervention measures including travel restrictions, closures of schools and nonessential business services, wearing of face masks, testing, isolation and timely quarantine on delaying the COVID-19 spread have been largely investigated and reported (6, 15, 20, 26, 32) . To mitigate and ultimately contain the COVID-19 epidemic, one of the important (non-pharmacological) control measures to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2 in the population is social (physical) distancing. An interactive web-based mapping platform (in Fig. 1A ) that provides timely quantitative information on how people in different counties and states reacted to the social distancing guidelines was developed (13) .",

Because COVID-19 is twice as contagious and far more deadly than seasonal flu, social (physical) distancing is critical in our fight to save lives and prevent suffering. However, so far, to what degree such guidelines have been followed from place to place before and after shelter-in-place orders across the U.S. and the quantitative effect on flattening the curve were unknown.",

Our fitting results corresponded to the up-to-date COVID-19 situation so far (Tables S1 and S2). Fig. 2A -E show the reported cases and the fitting curves in these five states using the formulas y c = t b + k and y c = ae bt , where y c is the total number of confirmed cases in each state, t is the number of days from the declared date of the pandemic: March 11, 2020, and a, b, k are the parameters we need to estimate (in supplementary materials). Meanwhile, we used linear regression to detect the travel distance decreasing rate over time. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the cases growth rate and the distance decay rate was -0.586 (95% CI: [-0.742, -0.370], p-value <0.00001). Fig. 2F shows the state-level correlation between the growth coefficients of confirmed cases and the travel distance decay coefficients across the nation. The moderate negative relationship indicated that in the states where the confirmed cases were growing faster, people responded more actively and quicker by reducing their daily travel distance.",

In return, the overall trend of reducing growth rates of cases was found later across different states although the geographic variation still existed. 4 The effect of social distancing on delaying the epidemic doubling time Specifically, we investigated how the social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders (Table S5 ) affected the epidemic doubling time of confirmed cases (from March 11 to April 10) in each state. We used mathematical curve fitting models and mechanistic epidemic prediction models using Bayesian parametric estimation of the serial interval distribution of successive cases to cross validate the conclusion (7, 31) . The fitted curves by an exponential model and a power-law model are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 . For the exponential model (Table S10) suitable during the early outbreak phase and our curve fitting results matched the outcomes of mechanistic epidemic prediction models ( Fig. S5 and S6 in supplementary materials) , such as the models reported by (7, 31) . These models used confirmed cases and the serial interval, that is the days between two successive infected cases.",

A similar result was found by fitting the power-law model (Table S11), in which initial estimates of the growth rates before the orders in each state were 0.12\u223c0.71 per day with a doubling time of 1.30\u223c6.18 days (median: 2.71 days; IQR: 0.915). The finding aligned well with the doubling time of 2.3\u223c3.3 days in the early outbreak epicenter Wuhan, China (28). After the orders, the estimates of the growth rate in each state by the exponential model were reduced to 0.03\u223c0.21 per day with a doubling time increased to 3.69\u223c27.72 days (median: 5.68 days; IQR: 2.203).
