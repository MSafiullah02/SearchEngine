It is generally agreed that observers should be people from outside the organization when possible.

Drills serve a very important purpose, and they must be conducted with all the realism possible. It is extremely difficult, however, to rehearse certain parts of an emergency disaster plan when the facility is open and conducting routine, everyday business. One of the most difficult elements to practice is that of people and vehicle traffic control. It is not practical to restrict visiting or to turn away patients who have an appointment.

This area-wide coordination has greatly improved the ability of a community, working together, to respond more effectively to the vast array of different types of emergencies both large and small. It is therefore natural to conduct emergency exercises and drills, both organization-specific and community-wide. There will continue to be more and more federal involvement in community emergency management through control of grants and legislation.

Absolute fire safety is unattainable because it is impossible to exclude from the facility everything that burns and all sources of ignition. Facility inspections are conducted by all kinds of inspectors, including representatives of insurance companies, CMS, TJC, city building departments, state and city health departments, and fire department personnel. Some of the best inspections, however, are those conducted by organizational personnel. If they are conducted properly, a continuous, everyday fire inspection program is accomplished. Security officers on their rounds should note and/or correct fire hazards they see or that are brought to their attention by others. Security officers on rounds should be particularly alert for people smoking in prohibited areas. Officers should correct and report doors left open that should be closed, obstructions to egress paths, careless use of oxygen cylinders, and other fire safety violations. If a hazard cannot be corrected on the spot, officers can, through proper reporting, initiate administrative action.",

In many healthcare facilities, detection equipment transmits a signal directly to the fire department, while at the same time alerting facility personnel. Smoke detectors use sensing units that respond to the presence of products of combustion that result from a fire. Other types of detectors may respond to heat or flame. When the threshold is exceeded, the sensor is activated. Most HCF fire detection systems use a combination of devices due to the varied situations the medical care environment presents. Activation of a fire detection device may also control various items of equipment; it may activate fire extinguishing equipment and air-handling machinery, send elevators to predetermined locations, and release magnetic hold-open devices on doors.",

            "text": "The third element of the fire safety program is the containment of smoke and fire. The objective is to contain the fire in the room or area of origin. When this is not possible, the goal is to provide successive levels of defense or areas of refuge from the fire. The five basic areas of fire containment are sometimes referred to as the unit concept. The units are the room, the compartment, the floor, the building, and the exits, all of which have a distinct function in the fire protection features of the building.\u2022\nUnit 1. The room\u2014the smallest unit\u2014is the first line of defense. The function of Unit 1 is to provide the first barrier against the passage of smoke. The more effectively a room can be sealed, the better job it will do in containing fires.\u2022\nUnit 2. The compartment is the second level of defense. The intention is to provide at least two areas of refuge on every horizontal plane of the facility. When an area must be evacuated, the initial movement is horizontal rather than vertical. The Unit 2 compartment is created by smoke and barrier walls.\u2022\nUnit 3. The floor, or floor assembly, is the next level of containment. The function of the floor assembly is to prevent the spread of fire and smoke from one floor to another.\u2022\nUnit 4. The building is the fourth level of protection. For the building to remain structurally intact for a period of time, it should maintain structural components that offer minimum contribution to any fuel load and that can withstand the effects of a fire within the facility.\u2022\nUnit 5. The exit path is the final unit in this concept of fire protection. At least two remote exits must be provided on each floor or fire section of the building. Exits need not necessarily lead directly to the outside. They can include egress to interior stairs, exterior stairs, horizontal exits, ramps, and exit passageways.\n",

            "text": "The fourth component of the facility fire safety plan is relocation of patients, visitors, and staff. The Life Safety Code\u2014through its standards for exit capacities, types of exits, travel distance, door specifications, and similar details\u2014ensures the necessary means of egress from a medical care facility during an emergency. It is the healthcare staff, however, who are responsible for moving any patients who are in imminent danger to a safe location. In hospitals, many occupants are incapable of self-preservation. This fact is recognized by the Life Safety Code, which places the main responsibility for patient safety on the HCF staff. Total building evacuation, as a measure of last resort, can and does occur. Patient relocation between smoke-protected compartments on the same floor is usually an adequate first step. Following the unit concept principle, the evacuation plan\u2019s first objective is to move patients to a safe compartment. At this point, it must be determined whether to continue horizontal evacuation or whether vertical movement (to another floor) is necessary. Wheelchairs and carts are useful and often necessary for relocating patients, but they may not always be available at the time and place of need. Blankets are always available, and security professionals generally agree that they can be the most important pieces of equipment on hand for evacuation. Elevators should receive special consideration in the fire evacuation plan. Generally, plans prohibit the use of elevators for egress or relocation purposes because of their recall features, which are normally activated in a fire condition. An elevator may stop at the wrong floor, exposing its occupants to the fire. On the other hand, high-rise hospitals present unique problems that may require the use of elevators for vertical relocation under controlled conditions. In addition, the fire department may need to utilize an elevator for their firefighting purposes. Generally a building of more than seven stories is considered a high-rise, and is the limit of most fire department ladders. A vertical evacuation plan is mandatory for high-rise buildings. One or more elevators in a wing removed from the fire area may be used to transport patients to another floor much more quickly and with fewer possible medical complications than when patients are carried down a stairwell.",

The suppression of fire by staff is achieved either manually or by automatic suppression systems required for all new construction. The automatic sprinkler system is the most common of the automatic suppression devices. The automatic sprinkler system also acts as an alarm device because all systems are installed with water-flow sensors that activate an alarm when water is flowing in the pipes. The sprinkler is activated by a thermally sensitive element that automatically releases water at a predetermined temperature. Other piped extinguishing systems include water spray, foam, carbon dioxide, dry chemical, Halon, and newer, environmentally sensitive, clean agents. The standpipe and hose system, found in most US medical care facilities, is used to provide quick and convenient water streams. This system is most generally used by fire department or trained fire brigade personnel. It is not uncommon to eliminate the hose at the valve locations. The rationale for this is that most fire departments supply their own hose. Further, there have been reports of vandalism by opening the valve a little, allowing the hose in the cabinet to fill slowly with water. The hand-held extinguishers used in medical care facilities are primarily two-and-one-half gallon, stored-pressure water extinguishers, carbon dioxide extinguishers, and multipurpose (ABC) extinguishers. The type of extinguisher at any given location is predicated on the primary type of hazard involved.",

Fire safety training is usually the responsibility of the Safety Administrator. Training can include posters, contests, in-service training, and fire drills. One of the obstacles faced in fire safety training is that little uniformity exists among facility fire plans.

Patients do not welcome a police officer, or a security officer, searching their room at 2:00 A.M. The search can be emotionally upsetting, and the reaction could very easily be panic. Many experts believe that bomb threat callers are frequently interested in stirring up as much activity and causing as much disruption as possible. Thus, one objective of a bomb search is to carry out the search in a smooth, routine manner, while taking every threat seriously. In bomb threat situations, the administrative person handling the threat may decide to advise only selected staff and patients. In general, patients should not be told of the problem unless absolutely necessary. Experience has shown that patients often set off a chain reaction that is detrimental to the entire process. Patients may respond by calling their families. In turn, the family may decide to come to the facility or call the facility for detailed information. This reaction can tie up needed communications lines and hinder response capabilities.",

In some plans, the search personnel are assembled as a group so that the search coordinator can relate to them the information received and assign specific areas to specific personnel. In other plans, this information is communicated by telephone or through a public address system with a code term such as \u201cMr. Search\u201d or \u201cCode Green,\u201d or via electronic means. A problem that must be taken into consideration is the staffing pattern of the facility. When all departments are fully operational, the facility can be more easily and quickly searched than when departments are closed and locked. During the nonoperational period, security, maintenance, and environmental services personnel may be assigned an expanded role in the search effort. Floor plans that have been divided into specific search areas are used in some facilities. Personnel are given a map of the area for which they are responsible. In other organizations, these assignments are made from an administrative checklist that defines the areas. However the parameters of the search are defined, the person responsible for searching a given area must always report back to the control center when the search has been completed. The primary concern is for personal safety rather than property. Thus, a threat at 11:30 P.M., when a minimal staff is on duty, may preclude searching all areas. It may be that closed areas such as food service, business and accounting areas, administrative offices, maintenance shops, medical record areas, and the like receive only cursory examination. The occupied areas of the facility should be searched more thoroughly. Some controversy exists over the use of two-way radios during a bomb search. It has been suggested that radios should not be used because a bomb might be constructed to detonate in response to the transmission of radio signals. However, most experts believe that this possibility is extremely remote. In almost all situations, the radio system is active before the bomb threat was received and would have already detonated the device. The benefits of two-way radios during emergency operations support their use unless specific information is received to the contrary.",

When the picketers see that employees are not being sufficiently discouraged and do cross the line to work, confrontations sometimes begin to take place. It is at this point that threats and acts of violence often occur. Administrators and supervisory personnel should be on the grounds during shift changes to support arriving personnel and to observe any incidents that might occur. Employees arriving to work are encouraged when they see the upper echelon there to support them rather than sitting safely behind their desks. Most healthcare facilities have a built-in security vulnerability that can become an asset during picket activities: a multitude of entrances and exits. For the duration of the strike or picketing, as many of these access points as possible should be open for employee use. The more entrances that are available, the more difficult it becomes for the picketers to cover them all. The law states that picket lines shall not restrict the right of people to enter and leave the facility. Despite this provision, thousands of incidents on record involve injury to people and destruction of property during picketing. In coping with this situation, it is a common mistake to assume that law enforcement agencies will maintain law and order. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, police protection is not always at its best at such times. The healthcare organization has a responsibility to provide for personal safety and to protect its assets. The security department will necessarily play a strong role in achieving this objective. Several days before the strike, there should be a thorough inspection of the exterior of the facility to remove signs and other items that could be easily vandalized. One item often overlooked is sprinkler heads\u2014a favorite target for picketers. Security personnel are generally deployed at the site of the picket line to show nonstriking employees and others who cross the line a high degree of protective support. Security\u2019s additional responsibility is to ensure that picketers stay off facility property, to prevent accidents, and to document evidence of wrongdoing. It is recommended that security personnel assigned to the strike detail be unarmed. A security objective is to be present but to project a fairly low profile, indicating that no trouble is expected. The type of trouble that might occur will not be deterred or corrected with the threat or use of a firearm. Security officers should be briefed by the administration and legal counsel just before they are deployed to the picket line. The basic message this briefing should convey is that officers must be professional. They must keep their eyes and ears open and their mouths closed. The officers should be reminded that they are representatives of the organization, regardless of their personal feelings about the situation.",

A major administrative mistake is to assume that the confrontation will not last long. This assumption makes it easy to ignore the central reporting and its record-keeping role until the organization is well into a prolonged strike. All information concerning activities and incidents related to the labor action should be reported immediately to the designated recording location. All supervisory employees should be given the responsibility of reporting all incidents brought to their attention. A chronological record of incidents, including complete details, serves a variety of purposes, not the least of which is collecting the data necessary for legal actions. A consolidated central reporting concept will also serve as a clearinghouse to verify or reject rumors and to readily assess the situation. An important tool in dealing with and documenting strikes and picketing\u2014and one that relates very closely to the incident recording function\u2014is the use of photography. The task of photographing the labor action should be an assigned responsibility. Because camera equipment is often antagonizing to picketers, it should be used in such a manner that a minimum of confrontation occurs. The organization\u2019s response to the labor action may require the unexpected expenditure of funds. Special arrangements may have to be made to procure supplies, obtain drivers and vehicles, authorize meals, use taxi services, authorize overtime, and the like.

            "text": "If it is to continue to carry out its mission, one of the first and most important steps an HCF must take during a labor action situation is to maintain a supply line. In most instances, a supply line requires the procurement of additional labor and vehicles. If vehicles are obtained from rental or leasing companies, it is usually only a matter of time before the rental agency demands the return of their vehicles. This tactic can be countered to some extent by having individuals rent vehicles from various agencies for onetime use. This procedure also proves valuable in avoiding harassment because the newly rented vehicle can be used to pick up supplies without being followed and subjected to threats, damage, or driver injury. Before picketing begins, the organization should contact all suppliers who make deliveries to the facility. The facility needs to know if nonunion or supervisory personnel will be available to make deliveries. It is better to pick up the supplies directly from the vendor or to have the order shipped to a temporary receiving site than to have confrontations between picketers and truck drivers. When truck drivers refuse to cross the line, their action supports and encourages the picketers. Because it is impossible for the facility to pick up the thousands of items it requires, particularly during a prolonged strike, offsite receiving areas can become necessary. Offsite receiving points should be well-secured and generally require security officer coverage. Depending on the severity of the strike, the location of the offsite receiving point should be changed periodically. Organizations should consider using a truck parked in a vacant lot or other out-of-the-way place and simply off-loading from one truck to the other. If the loaded trucks are not brought to the facility the same day, security precautions are important. One HCF involved in a severe labor action had parked three trucks overnight in an abandoned section of a railroad yard, and all three trucks were fire-bombed. The picket line not only inhibits the free flow of deliveries but also affects the removal of items, particularly trash. An institution of any size will find that a tremendous volume of refuse can build up in a very short time. It is essential that facilities move quickly to dispose of this material or they may find themselves in violation of health and fire standards. Inspectors from various federal, state, and local regulatory agencies just seem to proliferate during labor actions.",

Thus, the first step in riot protection planning is to survey the perimeter of the property. For example, this might be the time to recommend fencing the north property line to divert foot traffic from crossing through parking areas. Security administrators should also consider whether exterior lighting is adequately protected to minimize destruction, whether landscaping decorations or other external items should be removed, and how employee vehicles should be protected. The next step is to carefully survey the exterior of the buildings that will require protection. Access doors and windows are of primary concern. Even though normal access points cannot be eliminated during normal operations, administrators must be prepared to quickly authorize restricted access when a riot hits. The time to make certain that doors are equipped with the proper hardware is before a riot occurs. Security administrators should select the access point that could be controlled best if only one entrance were to be operative. The best entrance is not necessarily the most accessible one. If the facility has an emergency department, two access points are generally required: one for persons seeking medical care and another for everyone else. Windows and other glass areas are primary targets for destruction. Break-resistant glazing material is commonly used for protection. Another method is to precut plywood and install brackets on the window frames to permit easy and quick installation. If no glass protection has been installed or if the protection is minimal, interior blinds or curtains should be closed. If beds are near a window, they should be moved as far from the window as possible. Exterior lighting must be reviewed to determine whether the illumination is adequate. More light is needed during rioting than is needed under normal conditions. Security administrators should also check to determine whether light fixtures can be modified to prevent damage. Generally, little can be done in this regard, but making certain that lights are not within easy reach is at least one step that can be taken.",

Experience reveals that even though employees may be willing to travel to work under adverse conditions, anxious friends or relatives often persuade them to remain at home. Curfew terms vary widely according to local conditions and objectives. A common restriction is to prohibit people under a certain age from being on the streets after a certain hour. When this condition was imposed in a major city, it created a problem for the hospital because many employees were affected. The solution was simple. In addition to their name badge, employees carried a letter addressed to law enforcement that was signed by the hospital administrator, and contained the employee\u2019s name and address, the time dismissed from work, and a statement that the letter was intended for use only for the date indicated. This approach worked well and was reported to be widely accepted by law enforcement personnel. When police lines are established, altered travel routes are an obvious course of action. When police lines surround the facility, some procedure must be devised for staff access. Staff identification cards or badges are one solution. Another approach may be for a facility representative to be stationed at a central point along the police line to verify employee status. Individuals who attempt to cross the police line can be identified with simple questions about their department, employee number, birth date, or other data. The facility representative will be able to verify many employees by sight. During a civil disturbance, organizations may encourage employees to stay on the premises for their own safety and for the purpose of maintaining an adequate staff. Employees sometimes insist on staying regardless of the official stance, and thus some planning for employee housing is mandated. An inventory of beds that can be used in an emergency should be maintained. A thorough review of a facility often uncovers more beds than expected. Beds can sometimes be found in classrooms, blood banks, on-call rooms, and electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram areas. In addition, cots can be set up in many areas for temporary accommodations. To ensure the utilization of all beds and to keep a record of where employees are housed, assignments must be made by a designated facility representative. Employees should not be allowed to assume their own accommodations even in their own departments. When more employees request accommodations than are needed to work, a system of housing authorization by department heads may be necessary to maintain adequate control.",
