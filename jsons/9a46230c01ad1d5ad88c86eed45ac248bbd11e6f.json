Many scientists worldwide are making great efforts to study the etiology of this disease with different approaches. 13 species of SARS virus have been sequenced. However, most people still largely rely on the traditional methods with some disadvantages. In this work, we used Wolfram approach to study the relationship among SARS viruses and between SARS viruses and other types of viruses, the effect of variations on the whole genome and the advantages in the analysis of SARS based on this novel approach. As a result, the similarities between SARS viruses and other coronaviruses are not really higher than those between SARS viruses and non-coronaviruses.

In contrast with the traditional methods of DNA sequence comparison, Wolfram approach was based on the concept that simple rules are able to produce highly complicated behaviour such as dynamically viewing alterations on visualization, including transposition, insertion, deletion and duplication, etc., in a whole genome scale, and even in a single base scale when the base precisely located. Furthermore, it has become possible to make progress on a remarkable range of fundamental issues of lives that have never been successfully studied by any of the existing sciences based on traditional mathematical rules, which are limited in exploring the complex beha-viour in a typical biological system. For example, the evolutionary theory cannot really or completely explain the origin of complexity of biological system [15] . Research and speculation in living organisms at a molecular level that was normally neglected by Wolfram, have little success for the explanation of complexity in lives.",

In theory, still 255 more rules exist but the present rule provides the best solution.",

Furthermore, four smaller nested structures (approx. 2 kb long on average) were found within approx. 12-25 kb in SARS viruses but not in most other studied viruses (Fig. 4) . Therefore, it is rational to think that the nested structure is the typical feature of SARS viruses containing some special bio-information absent in other viruses, which may be involved in the development of SARS virus by producing replicase or vital protein in this region as suggested previously [21] (Fig. 5) .",

In 001, the middle cell accepting unequal powers, which are opposite each other from both sides, still maintains the final state 0 in the next step no fundamental similarity was found in equine rhinovirus (Fig. 1) . However, the whole genome of equine rhinovirus (ER) had similar regulating feature of SARS virus (Fig.  4) , although ER genome contained only 7734 bp as compared to more than 29 kb of SARS genome [21] [22] [23] [24] . Using traditional method, SARS virus was found to have high homology with porcine transmissible gastroen and human coronavirus 229E, but we found that SARS virus and equine rhinovirus had similar intrinsic image and specific nested structure (Fig. 4) . ER genome is much smaller than SARS virus genome, so it is unlikely that ER was mutated directly to SARS virus but we could not exclude the possibility that ER is the ancestor of SARS virus. At the same time, SARS virus and human coronavirus 229E are very different in behaviour. Another interesting finding is that the beginning genome sequences after the first \"atgccc\" of other coronaviruses have very similar behaviour. Furthermore, the behaviours of the last 2 kb region of each species are also similar.",

Hence, despite that high similarity of sequences in a certain region between two species can sometimes be found, it does not necessarily mean that their final behaviours should be the same. Instead, they can be greatly different. This may be explained by the fact that the similar sequence is also regulated by the complex network of power interactions among the whole genome. On the contrary, sequences obtained in the traditional way show less similarity but the distribution of interaction powers of bases in the network of power interactions among the whole genome can be very similar in behaviours, such as the process of pathogenesis between the two species. From this work, we think that SARS viruses are likely to catch a part of genetic information from other non-coronaviruses to increase their special power of causing the disease as a result of the partial similarities of behaviours between SARS and other non-coronaviruses like HIV.",

If the equal numbers of white and black lines meet each other, it will result in an interim balanced state between the two powers (Fig. 7) . However, in most circumstances the two lines eventually disappear because of the continence of the powers. While the number of black lines is much more than the number of white lines, the power represented by black lines will remain because of its dominant role. The remaining power, which is approximately equal to the power after the white line has been deducted from the black line, gets weaker, and vice versa. Nevertheless, the white line or the black line will not always go on if the counter-powers meet again in the following step. Both lines will disappear to reach a balanced state if they are equal. Otherwise, the line with more power will dominate the situation with the deducted power. Through their \"encounter\" again and again, at last only one type of line will exist with a final stably balanced state. Based on the interaction of power and counter-power, the \"encounter\" between the powers in white towards the left and the power in black towards the right in several locations may finally result in the formation of the nested structure, which is presumed to be the important state of life filled with complex regulation network.",

Though sometimes the result obtained by both the traditional and the new methods are similar, one of the important differences between them is due to the fact that the judgment with the traditional way always relies on homology or the variation of a single base, etc., which we think is not complete or objective. Instead, Wolfram approach pays attention to the interaction power of regulation between any adjacent bases, reflecting a major and basic power determining the development and evolution of organism along its own specific track. In fact, the interaction power between bases can be divided into two categories: promotion and continence with each other (Fig.  7) , which can be much more effective than single base alterations in the development of organisms. In addition, each base receives powers from neighbouring bases and exerts power to neighbouring bases at the same time, indicating that the role of each base in a sequence is variable. When all powers from different bases are gathered together, a network of huge power interactions with overlap of powers will be formed, but the balance will be easily broken by an alteration of sequence occurs because of its precision and fragility. As we know, sequence alteration sometimes can be ignored, but sometimes can not because the original base may play a key role in the behaviour of the whole genome. This also explains why some mutations do not affect life too much but sometimes even a single base mutation can cause death, which we call \"key (vital) base unbalance\" (Fig. 8) . The Wolfram approach is just a good way to answer this sort of questions.",

However, equine rhinovirus (ER) has more similar regulating characteristics of SARS as shown in the analysis by Wolfram approachbased method (Fig. 4) . Therefore, ER-based inhibitor could be better than human rhinovirus-based inhibitor for fighting SARS.",

According to the current thinking, however, HIV, which is still a kind of virus to cause huge troubles in man, should have a large number of similar complex information in the image but, instead, it looks more special than what we have expected. This may be also a reason why people are facing big difficulties to answer many scientific questions using the traditional way, which people have noted is actually limited in use.",

This can be due to the fact that traditional sequence analysis ignores the difference between any two bases. In contrary, Wolfram approach is sensitive even to the spot mutation of a single base, and our result shows the inner characteristics and future trend of the whole genome. As a result, the similarities between SARS viruses and other coronaviruses are not really higher than those between SARS viruses and other non-coronaviruses. Even in the result obtained by Guan et al. [32] , the difference between the sequences of SARS viruses and coronaviruses from Masked pa1m civet can be found. Therefore, more work remains to be done to clarify the cause in the future.",
