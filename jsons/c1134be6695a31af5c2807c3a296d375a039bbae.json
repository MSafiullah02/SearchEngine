In the 2016/2017 epidemic season more than 3,000 tests from children up to age 14 were examined. The dominance of subtype A/H3N2/ (40.9%) was confirmed. The evaluation was stratified by three age groups (0-4, 5-9, and 10-14 years), which revealed significant differences. The highest number of samples was available in the 0-4 years group. The highest percentage of positive samples was present in the 10-14 years group. Influenza-like viral infections, among them the respiratory syncytial virus, were also observed. Children due to immature immunity are at particular risk for influenza. A lack of proper vaccination coverage strongly increases the chance of serious complications of the infection.",

Influenza is an infectious disease in which children are particularly vulnerable because of the not fully formed immune system (Hallmann-Szeli\u0144ska et al. 2015) . In the epidemic season 2016/2017, the dominant subtype circulating in Poland was the A/H3N2/ virus. The best way to prevent illnesses among children is seasonal vaccination. In the epidemic season 2016/2017, according to the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) vaccination in children over 6 months of age and older was recommended, as well as in children with increased risk of complications caused by influenza. It also is important to vaccinate people who are in contact with children under 5 years of age. It is recommended to vaccinate pregnant women (2 and 3 trimesters), which makes newborn babies less vulnerable to contract the infection (Jackowska 2016) . Unfortunately, the percentage of vaccinated children in Poland is still dramatically low. In 2016, 0.60% of children aged 0-4 years and 0.94% children aged 5-14 years were vaccinated (Epimeld 2017) .",

            "text": "In case of influenza infection, especially in children, rapid diagnosis is important as it allows the introduction of antiretroviral treatment which should start up to 48 h after onset of symptoms (Brydak 2008) . The most precise and efficient method of confirming influenza virus in a test sample consists of molecular biology, be it reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or real-time quantitative transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (Cie\u015blak et al. 2017) . However, the method is as yet hardly available in tertiary hospitals. Instead, rapid antigen diagnostic tests are often used (Nitsch-Osuch et al. 2017) . Their use requires less time, which is an important factor in diagnosis (Chartrand et al. 2012) . Rapid methods of influenza diagnosis significantly reduce the overuse of antibiotics in children (Nitsch-Osuch et al. 2016) . The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are the only causal treatment of children infected by influenza virus. Administration of zanamivir is possible only in in-hospital setting, as the drug is given by inhalation (Jackowska 2016 Molecular analysis was performed by real-time qRT-PCR using the Light Thermocycler 2.0 System (Roche Diagnostics; Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Influenza A and B subtypes were identified using primers and probes obtained from the International Reagent Resource (IRR) program run by the US Center for Disease Control (CDC). The analysis was carried out in capillary tubes with a capacity of 20 \u03bcl, with 0.5 \u03bcl (20 nM) primers and 0.5 \u03bcl (5 nM) probes for each of the reaction. Briefly, reverse transcription was performed at 50 C for 30 min. The DNA was then subjected to the initial denaturation (1 cycle at 95 C for 2 min), with further amplification steps comprising the following: denaturation at 95 C for 15 s, annealing at 55 C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 C for 20 s; ",
