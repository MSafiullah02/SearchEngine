Yet every year, around 2.5 million children die from diseases that can be prevented by currently available or new vaccines. Vaccines have the potential to erase some of the most glaring global health inequities which currently shape the lives of millions. Often the most vulnerable \u2013 women, children, and adolescents in even the poorest countries, could be protected against life-threatening and debilitating disease within a generation. This chapter presents a historical perspective on the emergence of vaccines as a means of disease control and prevention over the past two centuries. Beginning with discovery of smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in 1796, the chapter identifies important milestones in widespread use of vaccines in global health, includingThe smallpox eradication initiative of the World Health Organization in 1970s, the Child Survival Revolution, and the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) of the 1980sThe United Nations Millennium Summit of 2000 and the resulting global commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)The International Conference on Financing for Development held in Mexico in 2002 and the corresponding financial commitments from high-income nations to support achievement of MDGsEstablishment of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization in 2000 to accelerate access to new and underused vaccines in poor countries\n",

According to the National Library of Medicine (U.S. National Library of Medicine 2002), the practice of variolation, where small scabs of tissue containing smallpox were inhaled causing the individual to contract the disease in a mild form, reduced the mortality rate among those exposed to the disease to 1\u20132% as opposed to 30% when individuals contracted the disease naturally. By 1700, the practice of variolation as a response to smallpox had expanded to India, Africa, and throughout the Ottoman Empire. Variolation was first practiced in Europe by 1717 and, by 1721, in the American colonies (U.S. National Library of Medicine 2002).",

Prior to the development of such vaccines, the loss of life from disease is illustrated in some staggering figures. For example, the influenza (or \u201cSpanish flu\u201d) outbreak of 1918\u20131919 resulted in more deaths than enemy fire in World War I (Plotkin 2005). The period of 1974\u20132000 can be considered a second phase in the history of immunization. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in 1974, expanding the smallpox eradication effort which was focused on one single vaccine into an infant program of six vaccines (against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, and tuberculosis). At the time, less than 5% of the world\u2019s children were immunized against these six diseases. Meanwhile, an increased degree of population mobility, for example, through commercial air travel, helped bring about the recognition that infectious disease prevention required a coordinated, global effort.",

This initiative comprised four interventions for reducing mortality: growth monitoring, oral rehydration, breastfeeding, and immunization (GOBI). At the same time, WHO led major vertical programs to combat vaccine-preventable disease, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections (Hardon and Blume 2005). The Universal Childhood Immunization (UCI) Goal was launched in 1984 to catalyze efforts toward universal immunization coverage. UCI aimed at accelerating EPI, capitalizing on the success in mobilizing support. As a result of these dedicated efforts, child mortality declined in many countries (Hardon and Blume 2005).",

A gap in the routine immunization schedules for children in developed and developing countries emerged as new vaccines, including those for hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib), varicella, pneumococcal, meningococcal, and combination formulations became a routine part of the immunization schedule for children and adolescents in high-income countries (Hardon and Blume 2005). Research and development priorities favored those products targeting developed countries. Vaccine quality and safety, taken for granted in many countries with robust regulatory agencies, fell behind in many countries lacking an effective quality assurance program for medical products. Quality and safety issues also point to the weakness of health delivery systems in many poor countries which limited the effective rollout of routine immunization. The gap in financial commitment to maternal and child health \u2013 which underpins and drives the North/South divide in access to immunization \u2013 widened over the 1990s as scarce resources were diverted to other emerging global health priorities. Many developing countries struggled to improve or even maintain their immunization rates. The end of the decade saw an overall decline in global immunization and vaccine production, and particularly among the poorest populations in the poorest parts of the world.",

These approaches may be in the form of highly successful vertical campaign strategies for the global eradication of polio and control of measles, delivery of basic vaccines in conflict environments, or in the longer-term efforts to create sustainable markets for new and underused vaccines in the poorest countries. GIVS was approved by the member states of WHO and the Executive Board of UNICEF in 2005. It sets out a plan to address the global immunization challenges over the decade 2006\u20132015 and strives to act with equity and gender equality, in addition to personal ownership, partnership, and responsibility. Placing immunization firmly within the health system strengthening agenda, GIVS \u201caims to sustain existing levels of vaccine coverage, extend immunization services to those who are currently unreached and to age groups beyond infancy, introduce new vaccines and technologies, and link immunization with the delivery of other health interventions and the overall development of the health sector\u201d (WHO/UNICEF 2005). The vision and goals of GIVS are a world in 2015 that highly values immunization and that has equal access to immunizations for all. This world would also support sustainable interventions in diverse social situations, changing demographics and economies, as well as being a world that will put vaccines to the best global health and security use.",

The IFFIm, launched in 2006, is a pilot of the larger International Finance Facility (IFF) that was originally proposed by the Government of the United Kingdom in 2005 to double global aid for development and to accelerate the availability of funds through the GAVI Alliance in 70 of the poorest countries around the world. The mechanism takes long term (20 years), legally binding commitments from donors (IFFIm 2008) and borrows against them for 10 years in the capital markets, producing up-front finance and thus stabilizing a portion of aid flow to developing countries. Because of the innovative \u201cfrontloading\u201d funding program, an anticipated IFFIm investment of US $4 billion is expected to prevent 5 million child deaths between 2006 and 2015 and more than 5 million future adult deaths from hepatitis B-related liver disease. Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) provide legally binding promises, usually offered by governments or other financial entities, to guarantee a viable market if a vaccine is successfully developed. This ensures revenues will be generated from the newly developed vaccine that will match those of other comparable medicines. AMCs speed the development of new vaccines by enabling biotech and pharmaceutical companies to successfully invest in vaccine development (IAVI 2005).",

This is based on the intent by the GAVI alliance partners to ensure that GAVI financial support is seen by all stakeholders as time limited and to ensure that countries move to a fuller ownership of their immunization program, including the introduction of new vaccines. Co-financing therefore aims at supporting and stimulating evidence-based priority-setting within the immunization program and within the health sector more generally. Financial commitments, however small, also generally require a higher level of government engagement. Through this approach, which will be evaluated in 2010, GAVI Alliance partners are working to help countries to be on a trajectory of eventual independence from GAVI support, acknowledging, however, that, for most of the GAVI-eligible countries this is likely to require a very long time",

The other key determinant will be sustained political support for health and for vaccines by developing country governments. Guyana is an example of a country that has been highly successful in achieving high immunization coverage and is the first GAVI-supported country to fully finance the purchase of pentavalent vaccine from its national budget (United Nations 2007). Guyana\u2019s continuing success is in part due to a very strong political commitment at the highest levels to finance the national immunization program, including efforts to protect it from economic shocks and shifts in donor priorities. More broadly, there has been a remarkable growth in the health budget from US $6.5 per capita in 1991 to US $61 in 2006 (excluding overseas development assistance). This accounts for 10% of national expenditure, while the government\u2019s goal is to reach 15% (Ministry of Health, Guyana 2002; Editorial, PharmacoEconomics and Outcomes News, 2007).",

            "text": "New technologies that strengthen vaccine delivery are under development. Priority is given to such technologies that will (a) expand access, (b) improve safety, and (c) cut the cost of immunization programs. They include the following five technologies:(i)\n\u201cSharps\u201d processing: The increased use of auto-disable (AD) syringes (syringes which lock themselves after a single injection) has greatly improved the safety of immunization programs by avoiding the reuse of contaminated syringes and reducing risks of transmission of blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV (Lloyd 2000). This success is, however, highlighting another problem which the health sector is facing, that of the handling of contaminated medical waste. In the case of immunization, this is mainly related to the disposal of used syringes and needles (these syringes represent between 5 and 10% of all injections given in the health sector but nevertheless the push to introduce AD syringes is increasing the pressure on immunization programs to tackle this challenge). Sharps are rarely disposed of at the point of use. Since sharps are transported to the point of destruction, the risk of infection from accidental exposure to sharps must be minimized. Four different technologies are being explored for this purpose: corrosive disinfectants, thermoprocessing, needle destruction, and plastic melting (Lloyd 2000). However, none of these options is currently sufficiently developed to be put into use in the field.(ii)\nMonodose pre-filled devices: Vaccine wastage constitutes a considerable cost to immunization programs. Monodose presentations eliminate wastage and the risk of contamination. When the monodose is pre-filled into an injection device, it increases quality and safety at the point of use. UniJect\u00ae is one such device that has been tested with HepB and tetanus toxoid (TT) (Lloyd 2000). Village health workers can administer it. Currently, major obstacles reside in the cost of the device and the need for additional cold storage space when multidose presentation is exchanged for monodose, but ultimately, the objective would be to provide an increasing number of immunizations with monodose preparations that would not require increased cold chain capacity.(iii)\nNeedle-free injections: Needle-free injectors deliver vaccine at high velocity into the skin without penetration of a needle, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of blood-borne pathogens (WHO 2007c). Technologies are being developed for both mono- and multidose presentations. Multidose injectors available have not been found safe and new models are under development. There are several monodose models available; however, they are not feasible for large-scale programs because of regulatory obstacles and high cost (WHO 2000).(iv)\nThermostable vaccine: Vaccine distribution and storage without a cold chain would considerably simplify the delivery system, reduce cost, and allow for integrated supply mechanisms. Removal of vaccines from the cold chain should be the highest priority for technology research. Sugar glass drying is one such technology that has shown great promise (Lloyd 2000). It can be used to produce multivalent vaccines that are completely heat stable, except under extreme climatic conditions. The high cost of regulation/licensing and the uncertainty about market prospects in industrialized countries have so far impeded the development and use of this technology.\n",

Vaccine management spans a spectrum of aspects involving the use and disposal of vaccines, from the manufacturers to the end-users, for which plans must be in place and regularly updated to ensure an effective and efficient service delivery including (i) inventory and forecasting; (ii) stock control; (iii) in-country distribution; (iv) storing and handling; (v) equipment replacement; (vi) procedures for the use of vaccine; (vii) monitoring of vaccine storage; (viii) transport management; and (ix) operational management. All of these areas would benefit significantly from research efforts to find alternative and innovative approaches. For instance, the heavy reliance on the cold chain remains a major economic and logistical burden on programs. The possibility of taking greater advantage of the real thermostability of vaccines and the increasing use of the Vaccine Vial Monitor by taking vaccines \u201cout of the cold chain\u201d is a field which has only begun but could potentially revolutionize immunization delivery (Table 23.4). Vaccine Vial Monitors are heat-sensitive circular labels, no wider than a centimeter, that change color as vaccines are exposed to heat. They are time\u2013temperature indicators used to (i) ensure that the vaccines have not been damaged by excessive exposure to heat, (ii) identify weaknesses in the cold chain, and (iii) take vaccines beyond the cold chain to reach out to children who have no access to fixed health facilities. Health workers can use the Vaccine Vial Monitor color to tell if the vaccine has been overexposed to heat and whether or not it is safe for immunization. This indicator cuts down on the uncertainty of vaccine safety due to potential temperature changes during transport along the cold chain. Therefore, the vaccine vial monitor reduces waste.\n\n",

Maternal and child health-related MDGs will be difficult to meet without significantly scaling up the coverage of existing vaccines and successfully introducing new pipeline products \u2013 ensuring that research and development priorities are aligned with the diseases for which preventative technologies are needed most. Financing this effort, however, poses a considerable challenge. A serious commitment to closing the North/South divide and meeting MDGs will require a joint approach that involves increased investment by developing country governments and better, more stable aid flows from donors. Increased investment, particularly in the social sector, will be critical to finance costs such as system building that require large amounts of sustained finance. In-kind investments in commodities can be scaled up rapidly without major concerns around absorptive capacity or macroeconomic stability. Long-term, predictable aid flows are also needed to reduce volatility and provide increased certainty over future budget flows to enable better planning in countries.",

Risk analysis is a common tool in the private sector \u2013 companies only take decisions based on the probable level of risk it implies for them. Yet the donor community consistently places the poorest countries in a position where it is very difficult for them to make choices of how or whether to radically scale up access to basic services. The donor community, including the GAVI Alliance and the international financial institutions, needs to develop strategies to reduce financial and political risks. This means adjusting processes and requirements to support the long-term integrated plans of developing countries. The financial risks of development strategies must be more equitably shared between donors and national governments. Development will be led by developing countries when they are enabled to plan ahead; when donors act on their recognition of the importance of predictable and long-term aid flows to meet the MDGs. Development will only happen when poor and vulnerable people are ensured equitable access to basic services. Accelerating the sustainable introduction of new and underused vaccines is part of realizing this ambition.",
