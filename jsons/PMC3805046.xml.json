SARS-CoV was first detected in late 2002 in Guangdong province, China and spread to more than 30 countries in a few months, causing 8000 infections and 800 deaths (Drosten et al., 2003, Fouchier et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The spread of the virus was ultimately controlled by the isolation of infected individuals, and the WHO declared the end of the SARS epidemic in July 2003. However, SARS-like coronaviruses remain and are circulating in bats all over the world, making virus reemergence a realistic possibility (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2006).",

These proteins are involved in genome replication and transcription of subgenomic mRNAs encoding the structural proteins nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M) and spike (S), as well as a set of CoV species-specific proteins. The spike protein is localized at the surface of the virion, and is responsible for the attachment to the cellular receptor, and for virus-cell membrane fusion, to facilitate virus entry (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV is the angiontesin convertin enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003, Wong et al., 2004), although the glycoprotein CD209L (L-SIGN) may also be used as a weaker alternative receptor (Jeffers et al., 2004).",

However, none of the infection models completely reproduce human clinical disease and pathological findings. To overcome these limitations, SARS-CoV was adapted to grow in mice by passing the virus in lung for 10, 15, or 25 times (Day et al., 2009, Nagata et al., 2008, Roberts et al., 2007). Infection of Balb/c mice with the resulting mouse adapted (MA) viruses reproduced many aspects of human SARS, including pathological changes in the lung, viremia, neutrophilia, and lethality (Day et al., 2009, Nagata et al., 2008, Roberts et al., 2007). This inbred mouse model of human SARS disease has many advantages compared to the other animal models, such as small animal size, low cost, availability of the animals, the possibility to genetically manipulate the host animals (i.e. to develop gene knock-outs and knock-ins), and the availability of immunological and molecular biology reagents specific to the host animals.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses generally do not induce a high interferon response (Frieman et al., 2008). At least two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the low levels of type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2) during coronavirus infections: the sequestering of viral RNA in double membrane vesicles (Gosert et al., 2002, Knoops et al., 2008), which prevents or reduces recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs); and the expression of viral proteins that antagonize the innate response. In fact, SARS-CoV proteins nsp1, nsp3, 3b, 6, M and N act as interferon antagonists (Devaraj et al., 2007, Frieman et al., 2007, Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007, Narayanan et al., 2008, Siu et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2012, Wathelet et al., 2007). However, even with these viral strategies of defensive evasion and offensive antagonism of interferons, there are well-described host proinflammatory responses to in vivo SARS-CoV infections. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1, -6, and -8, CXCL10/interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10, CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, CCL5/protein regulated and normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and CXCL9/monokine induced by interferon gamma (MIG) have been recognized in lungs of patients affected by SARS (Cameron et al., 2007, Huang et al., 2005, Jiang et al., 2005, Reghunathan et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2005, Wong et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2004). Upregulation of genes mediating inflammation has also been described after infection with SARS-CoV in different animal models such as cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys (de Lang et al., 2007, Smits et al., 2010, Smits et al., 2011) and mice (Baas et al., 2008). Accordingly, the expression of several proinflammatory genes is considered to be a strong correlate of SARS-CoV induced pathology.",

Using these cell lines, we demonstrated that a mouse adapted SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-MA15) induced the expression of genes leading to inflammation, as shown in SARS patients and experimental animal models infected with SARS-CoV. In addition, SARS-CoV-MA15 induced a weak IFN-\u03b2 response, as generally shown in coronavirus infections, preventing the robust production of type I IFNs.

This virus-induced cytopathology provides an additional experimental advantage of DBT-mACE2 cell lines, as the infection outcomes are overt and are similar to what happens to the epithelial respiratory cells in SARS patients (Lang et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2003).

Using genomic analysis, it has been shown that gene expressions encoding proinflammatory cytokines are increased in DBT-mACE2 cells, compared to mock-infected cells. These results correlate with the data obtained in SARS patients (Cameron et al., 2007, Huang et al., 2005, Jiang et al., 2005, Reghunathan et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2005, Wong et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2004) and in SARS-CoV-infected monkeys and mice (Baas et al., 2008, de Lang et al., 2007, Smits et al., 2010, Smits et al., 2011). In addition, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-MA15 infection induced a limited IFN-\u03b2 production in DBT-mACE2 cells. This weak induction could be due to the viral RNA sequestering in double membrane vesicles described in coronaviruses (Gosert et al., 2002, Knoops et al., 2008), which prevents or reduces recognition by PRRs, and to the expression of SARS-CoV proteins that antagonize the innate response (Devaraj et al., 2007, Frieman et al., 2007, Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007, Narayanan et al., 2008, Siu et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2012, Wathelet et al., 2007).",

(A) Cellular RNAs were extracted at 48 hpi. The expression of the indicated cytokines and interferons, and that of 18S rRNA as a control, was determined by qRT-PCR. In each case, the corresponding mRNA expression levels in SARS-CoV-MA15-infected cells were plotted as fold-change relative to expression levels in uninfected cells. (B) Cell extracts were prepared at 48 hpi. Expression of the cytokines CXCL10 and CXCL2 at the protein level was evaluated in mock and DBT-mACE2-infected cells.",
