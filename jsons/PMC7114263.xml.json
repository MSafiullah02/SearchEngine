Belonging to the order Nidovirales, the family Coronaviridae consists of two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae (Masters and Perlman, 2013). The Coronavirinae subfamily consists of four genuses, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and the recently identified Deltacoronavirus (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses that contain single-stranded, positive sense RNA with a genome size of approximately 25.4\u201331.7 kb (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Five CoVs have been identified in pigs: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). Within the past two years, PEDV and PDCoV were detected in the United States (US) domesticated pig population (Stevenson et al., 2013, Marthaler et al., 2013a, Marthaler et al., 2014b, Marthaler et al., 2014c, Li et al., 2014).",

In swine, 10% of the samples were positive for PDCoV and 2 whole genomes were generated. In February 2014, the Ohio Department of Agriculture officially announced the identification of PDCoV in the US. Veterinary diagnostic laboratories quickly developed real time RT-PCR assays to detect the newly identified virus, which had been detected in 9 states (Wang et al., 2014, Marthaler et al., 2014c). However, the viral pathogenesis and virulence was unknown since clinical disease was not associated with the initial discovery of PDCoV. Nevertheless, pathogenesis and virulence was determined in gnotobiotic and conventionally raised pigs, and severe, watery diarrhea, and vomiting appeared at 48\u201372 h post infection (Ma et al., 2015, Jung et al., 2015).",

The samples were processed, extracted, and tested for PDCoV per the clients\u2019 request, using previously described methodology (Marthaler et al., 2013b, Marthaler et al., 2014a, Marthaler et al., 2014c). The results were analyzed by sample and case ID. One positive sample corresponded to a positive case ID. If a case ID contained more than one age group, the different ages within the same case ID were considered different epidemiological unit of interest. Samples were further categorized by age consisting of suckling pigs (<21 days), nursery pigs (21\u201342 days), growing pigs (43\u201356 days), finishing pigs (57\u2013147 days) and mature pigs (>147 days).

In multivariable analyses of grouped data, environment and miscellaneous samples were excluded from the analysis since they are not associated with an age of pigs. Independent variables, age with 5 categories and specimen with 6 categories, were modeled using binary dependent outcome of positive PDCoV. Then, the covariate, state, was introduced into the previous model. The suckling pigs (<21 days) and fecal samples were the predefined-baseline reference. At first preliminary analysis, a warning signal of Quasi-separation was reported. Therefore, Firth\u2019s Penalized likelihood logistic regression models were employed to reduce the bias in maximum likelihood estimator for both univariate and multivariable logistic model (Firth, 1993, Heinze et al., 2013, Agresti, 2013). Comparing model and model selection was based on Penalized likelihood and Akaike information criterion (AIC), and lower values indicate a better fit of the analysis to the results. Finally, relative odds (OR) of PDCoV detection were estimated.",

The number of positive PDCoV samples for each month was estimated using smoothing function. Since the observed number of positive samples in the last three months was near zero and the expected number cannot be lower than zero, a Quasi-binomial likelihood method was used to estimate mean-variance relationship and its confidence interval (Agresti, 2013).

The complete PDCoV genome sequences from the US and South Korea shared a 99.7\u2013100% nucleotide identity while sharing a 98.9\u201399.3% nucleotide identity with the strains from China and Hong Kong. A time-scaled maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogeny was inferred for the concatenated open reading frames (24,507 nt). In the phylogenetic tree, the 36 US and single Korean strains group together in a clade (posterior probability = 1.0) (Fig 4\n). Viruses from different states are mixed within the tree, evidencing of extensive spatial dispersal of the virus and multiple viral introductions into states such as Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois. The diversity of US PDCoV strains traces back to a common ancestor that is estimated to be between August 2010 and September 2012, indicating that PDCoV has recently emerged in the US swine population. The viruses from Asia are not closely related, and inferring the origin country of PDCoV is difficult. The phylogeny is consistent with dispersal of PDCoV from the US to South Korea, although the lack of PDCoV genetic data from other countries makes this inference tenuous. The evolutionary rate of the PDCoV genome is estimated to be 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions/site/year (2.3 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20135.4 \u00d7 10\u22124, 95% HPD).

Oral fluids are contaminated with fecal material, and our results indicated that oral fluids had the highest OR associated with PDCoV detection. Pigs constantly chew on a variety of materials including feces. When the pigs chew on the ropes used to collect oral fluids, the feces, which can contain numerous pathogens, is transferred to the ropes.

Individual samples may be more likely to be taken from suckling piglets while group samples may be taken from older pigs. Piglets are weaned from their mother at approximately 21 days and comingled with a numerous piglets at nursery barns, possibly from multiple different sow farms. The comingling of piglets can contribute to the transmission of PDCoV. If one farm is positive for PDCoV while the other farms are negative, the virus will spread to the negative pigs due to fecal contamination from positive animals. In addition, the maternal immunity diminishes at weaning, which makes the piglets more susceptible to infections (Saif et al., 1994, Sestak et al., 1996). Numerous viral pathogens including rotavirus A, B, and C, have high co-infection rates in growing pigs (Marthaler et al., 2012, Marthaler et al., 2013b). Decreasing the number of enteric pathogens in growing pigs is vital to maximizing feed conversion and weight gain to reduce the number of days to market.",

At this time, it is impossible to infer that the PDCoV strains found in US swine came from China simply because the five Chinese sequences are basal to US diversity. Despite sampling from many geographically dispersed states the diversity of PDCoV found in US swine is restricted (\u226599.7 nucleotide percent identity), which is consistent with the relatively recent introduction of the virus inferred using a time-scaled Bayesian phylogeny. The lack of spatial structure observed for PDCoV in the US is also consistent with rapid dissemination of the virus across US state lines, including multiple introductions into a given state. The presence of PDCoV in approximately 2010 is supported by recent serological data, which detected swine PDCoV IgG antibodies in 2010 (Thachil et al., 2014). The evolutionary rate for PDCoV was estimated at 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions/site/year and has a similar evolutionary rate (6.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions/site/year) to PEDV, suggesting porcine enteric coronavirus, including TGEV, may evolve the same within pigs.",
