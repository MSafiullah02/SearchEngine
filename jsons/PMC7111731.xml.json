The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), belonging to the family Coronaviridae, can cause severe economic losses, mainly because of the induced respiratory and urogenital tract pathology (Jackwood, 2012, Bande et al., 2016). Infections of the gastrointestinal tract are described as well (Bande et al., 2016). In layers, reduction of egg-production and egg-shell quality are the major economic consequences of an IBV infection. In broilers, reduced weight-gain and the increased risk for bacterial secondary infections are the main drivers of IBV-induced economic losses.",

Five structural proteins are encoded\u2014the spike protein (S), the envelope protein (E), the membrane protein (M), and the nucleocapsid (N). There are several other nonstructural proteins encoded (Cavanagh, 2007). The S protein is responsible for virus binding and host cell entry and is an important inducer of neutralizing antibodies (Wickramasinghe et al., 2014). It is posttranslationally cleaved in the S1 and S2 subunit (Wickramasinghe et al., 2014). The S1 subunit is of main interest regarding genetic comparisons between IBV isolates. S1 nucleotide sequences of different serotypes differ up to 25% (Cavanagh, 2005). There are 3 hypervariable regions described within the S1 subunit sequence (HVR I aa 38-67, HVR II aa 91-141, HVR III aa 274-387) (Cavanagh et al., 1988), in which most nucleotide substitutions were located (Bande et al., 2017, Lin and Chen, 2017). It was shown that comparison of HVR I and whole S1 gene resulted in the same grouping data (Wang and Huang, 2000).",

The high-diversity of IBV strains and the ongoing emergence of new strains, because of genetic drift, are big challenges for developing vaccines and vaccination programs. For the continuous improvement of those, the knowledge of circulating field viruses in the specific region is essential. Recently an IBV variant called Israel strain 2 belonging to the GI-23 lineage was detected in Europe (Valastro et al., 2016, Lisowska et al., 2017). The strain was first described in Israel, causing severe respiratory and nephropathogenic lesions (Meir et al., 2004). Here, we describe the first evidence of IBV Israel strain 2 in a German broiler farm.",

Stocking density was 136.000 to 170.000 broiler per area. The houses were temperature and light controlled. Straw pellets were used as litter, and feed and water were given ad libitum. In January 2019, the chickens were hatched and placed on the farm the same day. In the hatchery, the chickens were vaccinated by spray with a live-attenuated IB QX strain (Poulvac IB QX; Zoetis, Berlin, Germany). At 10 D of age, the chickens got a second IB vaccination with a live-attenuated IB CR 88121 strain (Gallivac IB88 NEO; Merial, Hallbergmoos, Germany) mixed in drinking water. Additionally, birds were vaccinated against Newcastle disease (Avishield ND; Albrecht, Aulendorf, Germany) and Infectious bursal disease (AviPro Precise; Elanco Animal Health, Bad Homburg, Germany) on day 17 via drinking water. At 30 D of age, broilers stunted and showed ruffled feathers. In around 10% of the animals, headshaking and sneezing could be observed. The litter was becoming wet because of polyuria and diarrhea. Sick birds were stunned by manually applied blunt force and euthanized by cervical dislocation. In necropsy, animals showed congestion in the trachea and turbidity and foam in the air sacs. As a result of dehydration, the muscles appeared dark red. Ureters were congested, and kidneys were swollen. Five tracheae were removed and brought to the lab. On transport, samples were stored by 7\u00b0C.",

A bovine coronavirus sequence serves as outgroup. All sequences were downloaded from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Using MEGA 7 software, the evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model (Tamura and Nei, 1993, Kumar et al., 2016). The tree with the highest log likelihood (\u22121364.42) is shown. Initial tree for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the maximum composite likelihood approach and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 10 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were first + second + third + Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 472 positions in the final data set.",

The peculiarity of symptoms was mild, and losses were low compared with other outbreaks, and this can be because of the vaccination scheme, consisting of 2 live-attenuated vaccines used. A combination of 2 live-attenuated vaccines from the genotype QX and Massachusetts and D274 combined with H120, respectively, was shown to have 50 and 70% protection (Bru et al., 2017).",

Feed cost dominates the direct costs of broiler production. Even, slightly reduced weight gain can have an enormous impact on feed conversion rate and thereby makes it uneconomic (Gocsik et al., 2014, Onsongo et al., 2018). Wet litter can cause severe cases of pododermatitis, which is an important indicator for animal welfare in Germany and which is monitored in the slaughter houses by the veterinary authorities (Granquist et al., 2019). Therefore, it seems to be very important to find sufficient alternatives for vaccination to improve the protection level. Recently, a new IB-VAR206 vaccine was proven infield to show a good efficacy to protect broilers from clinical illness after exposure to field virus (Elhady et al., 2018). Until now, this vaccine has not been approved in Europe and can thereby only be imported, having a special authorization from the responsible veterinary authorities.",
