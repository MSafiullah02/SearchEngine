As shown in Fig. 2A, the strongest humoral response was induced by the regimen consisting of pAAV-CE1E2 prime and rTTV-E1E2 boost, in the third group. The titer from this regimen was 1.12 at the 1:100 dilution, and the antibody titer remained as high as 0.34 at the 1:800 dilution. The second best humoral response was induced by the regimen consisting of pVRC-CE1E2 prime and rTTV-E1E2 boost from the second group, in which the titer was 0.98 at the 1:100 dilution and 0.21 at the 1:800 dilution. The third strongest humoral response was induced by the regimen consisting of pAAV-CE1E2 prime and no boost, also from the third group; the titer was 0.53 at the 1:100 dilution and decreased to the background level at the 1:800 dilution. The remaining regimens did not raise sufficient humoral responses in this study. Our data suggest that the pAAV-CE1E2 plasmid is the best choice for prime, and that rTTV-E1E2 is the best choice for the boost; although pVRC-CE1E2 alone could not induce a high enough humoral response at the time point blood samples were taken, the rTTV-E1E2 may even boost the humoral response to a fairly high level (Fig. 2A).",

Our results indicate that pAAV-CE1E2 is better than pVRC-CE1E2 as a priming candidate, suggesting that the ITR can improve and extend the T-cell response to HCV. Recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVVs) were generated in the early 1980s and shown to be capable of inducing protective T-cell responses in small animals [22], meanwhile, the rVVs have many advantages for immunization [7], [9]. We selected a highly replicating rTTV as a boosting vaccine since it might induce long-lasting immune responses via a single dose and its safety is well documented for a large population. Compared to rTTV-E1E2 boosting, rAAV-E1E2 elicited a much lower T-cell response, which was consistent with the recent reports that AAV may impair the T-cell response in certain situations [23].",
