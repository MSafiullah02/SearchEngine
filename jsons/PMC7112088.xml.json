Generally, influenza peak once in the winter in temperate areas (Finkelman et al., 2007), however, it seems that the seasonal patterns in tropical and subtropical zones are more complicated. Several previous studies reported that the peaking of seasonal influenza occurred once a year (in winter or spring/summer) in some subtropical areas (Cheng et al., 2012), however, other studies found the peaks in subtropical regions were detected in both summer and winter (Iha et al., 2016, Liu et al., 2017). Furthermore, the transmission patterns of seasonal influenza were very diverse in China by region (Du et al., 2012, Shu et al., 2010, Yu et al., 2013). The seasonal patterns of seasonal influenza are driven by the complex interaction among influenza virus, climate factors and human activity patterns (Alonso et al., 2007, Surveillance and System, 2012, Tamerius et al., 2013).",

Low temperature has been reported to favour the transmission of influenza in temperate and tropical climate (Huang et al., 2017, Soebiyanto et al., 2014, Tsuchihashi et al., 2011, Xu et al., 2013), as well as to increase the mortality of influenza (Davis et al., 2012). A decrease of temperature during the preceding three days was correlated to an increased risk of influenza infections in cold climate (Jaakkola et al., 2014). Other climate variables, such as absolute humidity, relative humidity and rainfall have also been reported to be associated with seasonal influenza infections (Gomez-Barroso et al., 2017, Shaman and Kohn, 2009, Shaman et al., 2010b, Tamerius et al., 2013). Moreover, the geographical variation of seasonal patterns of influenza indicates that climate factors may promote influenza infections with complex interactive effects, such as the significant interactive effect between temperature and relative humidity (Wang et al., 2017). However, the majority of previous studies focused on tropical or temperate zones, little is known about the associations of multiple climate variables with different influenza types in subtropical regions.",

Multicollinearity among climate variables was checked and avoid through performing Spearman correlation analysis and variance inflation factors (VIF). Only one of the highly-correlated variables (r > 0.6 or VIF > 5) was included in the model (Wu et al., 2015). AH was excluded in our final model, as this factor strongly associated with MeanT (Peci et al., 2019, Shaman et al., 2010b), with the Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.97 (p < 0.05) (Table S1). GLM with a negative binomial distribution was assumed to allow over-dispersion (Wang et al., 2018). We developed GLMs including all climate variables to adjust the relationships between climate factors and seasonal influenza. The model used in our study was given as follow:logEYt=\u03b20+\u03b21MeanTt+\u03b22DTRt+\u03b23RHt+\u03b24Wvt+factorWOY+factorHoliday+etwhere E(Yt) is the expected weekly count of positive Flu-A or Flu-B on week t; \u03b20 is the intercept; \u03b21 (MeanTt), \u03b22 (DTRt), \u03b23 (RHt) and \u03b24 (Wvt) denote the corresponding regression coefficients of MeanT, DTR, RH and Wv, respectively; Week of year (WOY) was included in the model adjusting for seasonality; Holiday refer to a binary variable for public holiday to control the impact of public holidays (Wang et al., 2018); et is the error term.",

A decline of 1 \u00b0C in temperature increased influenza infections risk by 11% in Finland (Jaakkola et al., 2014). Moreover, 1 \u00b0C decrease of temperature cased a rising of 8.55% in influenza cases in Hong Kong, and an increase of 32.14% in the UK (Wang et al., 2017). Low temperature may lengthen the survival of influenza virus, and lead to increasing contact rates through more people indoor crowding (Cheng et al., 2016, Liao et al., 2005). As a result, low temperature could contribute to the spread of influenza. It should be noted that another peak of RR in high temperature for Flu-A was observed in the study. This finding was supported by previous studies, which reported the semiannual epidemic in the summer in subtropical cities in China (Yang et al., 2018a, Yang et al., 2018b, Ye et al., 2019).

Several previous studies indicated that low RH can favour the transmission of influenza (Hemmes et al., 1960, Lowen et al., 2007, Schaffer et al., 1976, Sundell et al., 2016). Low RH can allow influenza virus particles to remain in the air for longer time because of the smaller size and lower velocity of settling (Yang and Marr, 2011). As a result, there is an increase of susceptibility to influenza infections (Eccles, 2002). Additionally, low RH can also preserve the viability of influenza virus. The infectivity can keep as 70.6\u201377.3% when RH was less than 23% for 1 h, however, the number decreased to 14.6\u201322.2% at RH \u2265 43% (Noti et al., 2013). Additionally, low AH could exert significant impact on influenza transmission. In China, the RR for influenza (H7N9) at low AH (5 mb) was 11.34 (95%CI: 8.72\u201314.74) when compared to high AH (20 mb) (Liu et al., 2018). Moreover, low AH may contribute to the onset and peak of influenza epidemics (Murray and Morse, 2011). In the temperate regions of the US, AH was used to predicted the seasonal patterns of influenza (Shaman et al., 2010a, Shaman and Kohn, 2009).",

High Wv could lead to increased infections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (du Prel et al., 2009, Firestone et al., 2012, Yuan et al., 2006). A field study indicated that an increased risk of influenza in horses was associated with Wv of >30 km/h (Firestone et al., 2012). In India, Wv was positively correlated to an increase risk for influenza (H1N1) (linear regression coefficient: 1.02, p < 0.05) (Lopez et al., 2014). This may due to the effects of high wind speed on the longer travel of air-borne aerosols, which contributed to the transmission of influenza virus (Ssematimba et al., 2012).",

The area with temperate climate appeared to have greater risk in temperature and humidity, compared to subtropical regions (Wang et al., 2017). The author reported that this may due to a lower mean temperature and humidity in temperate areas than that in subtropical regions. Influenza virus can survive longer in low temperature, and cold weather also causes increased opportunity of infection by indoor crowding (Cheng et al., 2016, Liao et al., 2005). Furthermore, low outdoor temperature may lead to increased use of indoor heating facility, which would decline the indoor humidity and promote influenza infections (Chong et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Additionally, our results indicated that climate factors posted different effects on Flu-A and Flu-B activity. The previous results for the effects on two influenza types were not conclusive. A study from German observed a negative association of temperature with Flu-A hospitalization, but not with Flu-B (du Prel et al., 2009). The occurrence of Flu-B decreased when temperature increased in Hong Kong, however, no significant finding for Flu-A was reported in the study (Tang et al., 2010). Flu-A virus seems to change the antigen more frequently than Flu-B virus (Bouvier and Palese, 2008), which may influence the sensitivity to climate variability. Moreover, the different associations of Flu-A and Flu-B with DTR may partially resulted from the age distribution of influenza infections. Our previous study in Shanghai and other studies on a global scale showed that Flu-A virus is more transmissible among elderly than young children (Fox et al., 1982, Frank et al., 1983, Longini et al., 1982, Ye et al., 2019). It has been widely accepted that elderly people are more vulnerable to DTR (Lim et al., 2012, Qiu et al., 2013), thus, Flu-A was positively correlate to DTR in the study. Additionally, the different seasonality of Flu-A and Flu-B may be another potential reason behind. Our previous work demonstrated that Flu-A peaked from December to January, while the peak of Flu-B can last to April (Ye et al., 2019). The effect of DTR on different influenza type is less well studied, further studies are required to explore such impact.",
