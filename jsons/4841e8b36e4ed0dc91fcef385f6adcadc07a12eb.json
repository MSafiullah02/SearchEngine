In contrast, living at higher elevations may adversely affect mortality from respiratory diseases, with some indications also pointing to negative consequences on lower respiratory tract infections and disease progression (Burtscher, 2014) . It is, however, difficult to dissect the causal factors attributed to these altitudeconferred benefits, as living in high altitude involves a multitude of adaptations and altered conditions. The most obvious factors differing from life in lowlands at comparable latitudes are changes in temperature, altered exposure to radiation and of course hypoxia due to reduced barometric pressure.",

One could also argue that increased exposure to UV-B light at high altitude theoretically will lead to elevated vitamin D levels (Kimlin, 2008) , which in turn could decrease viral infection susceptibility (Grant et al., 2020) , although the potentially beneficial effects of vitamin D levels with regard to specifically SAR-CoV-2 has not yet been sufficiently explored.",

It is, however, important to highlight that acute and chronic high altitude (homeostatic and developmental plasticity) adaptations may be fundamentally different to transgenerational adaptations. For example, while Tibetan highlanders have developed transgenerational adaptations to altitude that include for example a rather \"normal\" hemoglobin concentration, lowlanders exposed to high altitude exhibit increased hemoglobin values as a compensatory adaptation to hypoxia (Simonson et al., 2010) . Thus, while the studies referred to by Arias-Reyes and colleagues (Arias-Reyes et al., 2020) clearly demonstrate individual adaptations of ACE2 in in vitro and animal models in response to chronic hypoxia, human studies (e.g. genetics) related to ACE2 are needed to confirm equivalent molecular long-term adaptations in high altitude populations.",

Climatic factors, like low temperature and humidity or frequent high-wind conditions may be involved in the negative development as well.
