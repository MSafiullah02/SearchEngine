Drops in viral load are reported to occur using daily doses of 800 mg of hydroxychloroquine,1 corresponding to 500 mg of chloroquine (as used in the Indian study), but not using 250 mg of chloroquine daily,5 corresponding to 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine (as adopted in the Singapore study). Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine might thus be a valuable option to be tested in low-cost antiretroviral combinations, but correct dosages should be used, considering that the study participants should be regularly monitored to prevent retinopathy. Prospective randomised double-blind placebo studies are also needed to assess the contribution of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine as part of an antiretroviral regimen. According to new in-vitro results, the antiretroviral effects of chloroquine are attributable to the inhibition of viral particle glycosylation.6 These effects appeared to be specific, since the chloroquine concentrations effective in vitro neither affected any other step in HIV-1 replication nor were cytotoxic.6\n",

Time-of-addition experiments indicated that chloroquine affected an early stage of SARS coronavirus replication.7 Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) reported potent anti-SARS coronavirus effects of chloroquine in vitro, attributable to a deficit in the glycosylation of the SARS coronavirus receptor ACE2.8 Again, the antiviral drug concentrations were not cytotoxic. If animal models confirm these results, chloroquine might represent a valuable therapeutic option if SARS re-emerges.",

If chloroquine should indeed inhibit the biosynthesis of sialic acid, this effect could explain not only the effects of chloroquine on HIV and SARS coronavirus (sialic acid moieties are present in HIV-1 glycoproteins and SARS coronavirus receptor ACE2), but also the in-vitro effects on orthomyxoviruses (which use sialic acid moieties as receptors15).
