            "text": "The products resulting for biotechnologies continue to grow at an exponential rate, and the expectations are that an even greater percentage of drug development will be in the area of the biologics. In 2011, worldwide there were over 800 new biotech drugs and treatments in development including 23 antisense, 64 cell therapy, 50 gene therapy, 300 monoclonal antibodies, 78 recombinant proteins, and 298 vaccines (PhRMA 2012). Pharmaceutical biotechnology techniques are at the core of most methodologies used today for drug discovery and development of both biologics and small molecules. While recombinant DNA technology and hybridoma techniques were the major methods utilized in pharmaceutical biotechnology through most of its historical timeline, our ever-widening understanding of human cellular function and disease processes and a wealth of additional and innovative biotechnologies have been, and will continue to be, developed in order to harvest the information found in the human genome. These technological advances will provide a better understanding of the relationship between genetics and biological function, unravel the underlying causes of disease, explore the association of genomic variation and drug response, enhance pharmaceutical research, and fuel the discovery and development of new and novel biopharmaceuticals. These revolutionary technologies and additional biotechnology-related techniques are improving the very competitive and costly process of drug development of new medicinal agents, diagnostics, and medical devices. Some of the technologies and techniques described in this chapter are both well established and commonly used applications of biotechnology producing potential therapeutic products now in development including clinical trials. New techniques are emerging at a rapid and unprecedented pace and their full impact on the future of molecular medicine has yet to be imagined.",

            "text": "The full spectrum of human genetic variation ranges from large chromosomal changes down to the single base pair alterations. The challenge for genomic scientists is to discover the full extent of genomic structural variation, referred to as genotyping, so that the variations and genetic coding may be associated with the encoded trait or traits displayed by the organism (the phenotype). And they wish to do this using as little DNA material as possible, in as short time and for the least cost, all important characteristics of a useful point-of-care clinical technology. The discovery and genotyping of structural variation has been at the core of understanding disease associations as well as identifying possible new drug targets (Alkan et al. 2011). DNA sequencing efficiency has facilitated these studies. In the decade since the completion of the HGP, sequencing efficiency has increased by approximately 100,000-fold and the cost of a single genome sequence has decreased from nearly $1 million in 2007 to $1,000 just recently (Treangen and Salzberg 2011). The move toward low-cost, high-throughput sequencing is essential for the implementation of genomics into personalized medicine and will likely alter the future clinical landscape. Next-generation genome sequencing methodologies, which differ from the original cloning-based Sanger technique, are high-throughput, imaging-based systems with vastly increased speeds and data output. There is no clear definition for next-generation genome sequencing, also known generally as NGS, but most are characterized by the direct and parallel sequencing of large numbers of amplified and fragmented DNA without vector-based cloning. The fragmented DNA tends to have sequence reads of 30\u2013400 base pairs. There are now numerous examples of single-molecule techniques utilizing commercially available DNA sequencers (Cherf et al. 2012; Woollard et al. 2011). Early in 2012, the DNA sequencing companies Illumina and Life Technologies each announced new products that can sequence an entire human genome in 1 day for approximately $1,000 (BusinessWeek 2012).",

Determining gene functionality in any organism opens the door for linking a disease to specific genes or proteins, which become targets for new drugs, methods to detect organisms (i.e., new diagnostic agents), and/or biomarkers (the presence or change in gene expression profile that correlates with the risk, progression, or susceptibility of a disease).

Now that the sequencing of the entire genome is a reality, the chore of sorting through human, pathogen, and other organism diversity factors and correlating them with genomic data to provide real pharmaceutical benefits is an active area of research. Comparative genomics is the field of genomics that studies the relationship of genome structure and function across different biological species or strains and thus, provides information about the evolutionary processes that act upon a genome (Raghavachari 2012). Comparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the regulatory regions of genes, as well as RNA and proteins of different organisms to infer how selection has acted upon these elements.",

Unlocking genomic data for each of these organisms provides valuable insight into the molecular basis of inherited human disease. S. cerevisiae, a yeast, is a good model for studying cancer and is a common organism used in rDNA methodology. For example, it has become well known that women who inherit a gene mutation of the BRCA1 gene have a high risk, perhaps as high as 85 %, of developing breast cancer before the age of 50 (Petrucelli et al. 2011). The first diagnostic product generated from genomic data was the BRCA1 test for breast cancer predisposition. The gene product of BRCA1 is a well-characterized protein implicated in both breast and ovarian cancer. Evidence has accumulated suggesting that the Rad9 protein of S. cerevisiae is distantly, but significantly, related to the BRCA1 protein. The fruit fly possesses a gene similar to p53, the human tumor suppressor gene. Studying C. elegans, an unsegmented vermiform, has provided much of our early knowledge of apoptosis, the normal biological process of programmed cell death. Greater than 90 % of the proteins identified thus far from a common laboratory animal, the mouse, have structural similarities to known human proteins.",

A recent National Research Council report for the US National Academies entitled \u201cToward Precision Medicine: Building a Knowledge Network for Biomedical Research and a New Taxonomy of Disease\u201d calls for a new data network that integrates emerging research on the molecular basis of diseases with the clinical data from individual patients to drive the development of a more accurate taxonomy of disease that ultimately improves disease diagnosis and patient outcomes (U.S. National Academies 2011). The report notes that challenges include both scientific (technical advances needed to correlate genetic and environmental findings with incidence of disease) and legal and ethical challenges (privacy issues, electronic health records or EHR, etc.).\n\n",

The transcriptome is the collection of all RNA transcribed elements for a given genome, not only the collection of transcripts that are subsequently translated into proteins (mRNAs). Noncoding transcripts such as noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) are part of the transcriptome (cf. 10.1007/978-1-4614-6486-0_23). The transcriptome represents just a small part of a genome, for instance, only 5 % of the human genome (Lu et al. 2005). The term transcriptomics refers to the omic technology that examines the complexity of RNA transcripts of an organism under a variety of internal and external conditions reflecting the genes that are being actively expressed at any given time (with the exception of mRNA degradation phenomena such as transcriptional attenuation) (Subramanian et al. 2005). Therefore, the transcriptome can vary with external environmental conditions, while the genome is roughly fixed for a given cell line (excluding mutations). The transcriptomes of stem cells and cancer cells are of particular interest to better understand the processes of cellular differentiation and carcinogenesis. High-throughput techniques based on microarray technology are used to examine the expression level of mRNAs in a given cell population.",

Proteomics seeks to define the function and correlate that with expression profiles of all proteins encoded within an organism\u2019s genome or \u201cproteome\u201d (Veenstra 2010). While functional genomic research will provide an unprecedented information resource for the study of biochemical pathways at the molecular level, certainly a vast array of the approximately 20,000 genes identified in sequencing the human genome will be shown to be functionally important in various disease states (see druggable genome discussion above). These key identified proteins will serve as potential new sites for therapeutic intervention (see Fig. 8.1). The application of functional proteomics in the process of drug discovery has created a field of research referred to as pharmacoproteomics that tries to compare whole protein profiles of healthy persons versus patients with disease. This analysis may point to new and novel targets for drug discovery and personalized medicine (D\u2019Alessandro and Zolla 2010). The transcription and translation of approximately 20,000 human genes can produce hundreds of thousands of proteins due to posttranscriptional regulation and posttranslational modification of the protein products. The number, type, and concentration may vary depending on cell or tissue type, disease state, and other factors. The proteins\u2019 function(s) is dependent on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structure of the protein and the molecules they interact with. Less than 30 years old, the concept of proteomics requires determination of the structural, biochemical, and physiological repertoire of all proteins. Proteomics is a greater scientific challenge than genomics due to the intricacy of protein expression and the complexity of 3D protein structure (structural proteomics) as it relates to biological activity (functional proteomics). Protein expression, isolation, purification, identification, and characterization are among the key procedures utilized in proteomic research.",

Detection of or concentration change of a biomarker may indicate a particular disease state (e.g., the presence of a certain antibody may indicate an infection), physiology, or toxicity. A change in expression or state of a protein biomarker may correlate with the risk or progression of a disease, with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment or the drug\u2019s safety profile. Implemented in the form of a medical device, a measured biomarker becomes an in vitro diagnostic tool (Williams et al. 2006). While it is well beyond this chapter to provide a detailed discussion of biomarkers, it is important to note that omic technologies including omic-enabled technologies such as microarrays are being developed as clinical measuring devices for biomarkers. Biomarkers enable characterization of patient populations undergoing clinical trials or drug therapy and may accelerate drug development. Modern drug discovery often simultaneously involves biomarker discovery and diagnostic development (Frank and Hargreaves 2003). Drug development scientists are hopeful that the development of appropriate biomarkers will facilitate \u201cgo\u201d and \u201cno go\u201d decisions during a potential therapeutic agents development process (Pritchard and Jurima-Romet 2010). Biomarker discovery is closely tied to the other applications of genomics previously described in this chapter. As an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to therapeutic intervention, biomarkers may serve as a substitute for a clinical end point and thus be a surrogate end point (Semizarov 2009b). Biomarkers are now available for a wide range of diseases and conditions including Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease (Maetzler and Berg 2010), cardiac injury (McLean and Huang 2010), lung injury (Kodavanti 2010), drug-induced liver injury (Ozer et al. 2010), acute kidney injury (Dieterle and Sistare 2010), immunotoxicity (Dietert 2010), various cancers (Kelloff and Sigman 2012), pediatric care (Goldman et al. 2011), and a host of other diseases and biological conditions.",

Thus, the diagnostic and the therapy are distinctly coupled = theranostic. The theranostic predicts clinical success of the drug.

The field of metabonomics is the holistic study of the metabolic continuum at the equivalent level to the study of genomics and proteomics. However, unlike genomics and proteomics, microarray technology is little used since the molecules assayed in metabonomics are small molecule end products of gene expression and resulting protein function. The term metabolomics has arisen as the metabolic composition of a cell at a specified time, whereas metabonomics includes both the static metabolite composition and concentrations and the full-time course fluctuations. Coupling the information being collected in biobanks, large collections of patient\u2019s biological samples and medical records, with metabonomic and metabolomic studies, will not only detect why a given metabolite level is increasing or decreasing but may reliably predict the onset of disease. Recent research and discoveries in oncology have led to reconsiderations regarding metabolic dysfunctions in cancer cell proliferation and differentiation. Metabolomic studies may be able to interrogate cancer cells for oxidative stress, a leading cause of genetic instability underpinning carcinogenesis, therefore indicative windows during the life of a cancerous cell for optimal therapeutic intervention (D\u2019Alessandro and Zolla 2012). Also, the techniques are finding use in drug safety screening, identification of clinical biomarkers, and systems biology studies (see below).",

SNPs, when associated with epidemiological and pathological data, can be used to track susceptibilities to common diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes (Davidson and McInerney 2009). Biomedical researchers have recognized that discovering SNPs linked to diseases will lead potentially to the identification of new drug targets and diagnostic tests. The identification and mapping of hundreds of thousands of SNPs for use in large-scale association studies may turn the SNPs into biomarkers of disease and/or drug response. Genetic factors such as SNPs are believed to likely influence the etiology of diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and lipidemias directly and via effects on known risk factors (Davidson and McInerney 2009). For example, in the chronic metabolic disease type 2 diabetes, a strong association with obesity and its pathogenesis includes defects of both secretion and peripheral actions of insulin. The association between type 2 diabetes and SNPs in three genes was detected in addition to a cluster of new variants on chromosome 10q. However, heritability values range only from 30 to 70 % as type 2 diabetes is obviously a heterogeneous disease etiologically and clinically. Thus, SNPs, in the overwhelming majority of cases, will likely not be indicators of disease development by themselves.",

Pharmacogenomics combines traditional pharmaceutical sciences with annotated knowledge of genes, proteins, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. It might be viewed as a logical convergence of the stepwise advances in genomics with the growing field of pharmacogenetics. Incorrectly, the definitions of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are often used interchangeably.

These studies are an examination of the many genetic variations found in different individuals to determine any association between a variant (genotype) and a biological trait (phenotype). The majority of GWAS typically study associations between SNPs and drug response or SNPs and major disease. While the first GWAS was published only in 2005, they have emerged as important tools with, as per data from the NHGRI GWAS Catalog, hundreds of thousands of individuals now tested in over 1,200 human GWAS examining over 200 diseases and traits and 6,229 SNPs as of early 2012 (Hindroff et al. 2012). While believed to be a core driver in the vision for personalized medicine, GWAS when coupled to the HapMap Project (an international effort to identify and map regions of DNA sequence nearly identical within the broad population) to date have been plagued by inconsistencies in genotypes, difficulties in assigning phenotypes, and overall quality of the data (Hong et al. 2010; Miclaus et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2011a, b, c). Challenges have included difficulties identifying the key genetic loci due to two or more genes with small and additive effects on the trait (epistasis), the trait caused by gene mutations at several different chromosomal loci (locus heterogeneity), environmental causes modifying expression of the trait or responsible for the trait, and undetected population structure in the study such as those arising when some study members share a common ancestral heritage (Brazeau and Brazeau 2011b). The practical use of this approach and its introduction into the everyday clinical setting remain a challenge, but will undoubtedly be aided by new next-generation sequencing techniques, enhanced bioinformatics capabilities, and better genomic understanding.",

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for warfarin account for 15 % of all ADRs in the USA, second only to digoxin. Warfarin dose is adjusted with the goal of achieving an INR (International Normalized Ratio = ratio of patient\u2019s prothrombin time as compared to that of a normal control) of 2.0\u20133.0. The clinical challenge is to limit hemorrhage, the primary ADR, while achieving the optimal degree of protection against thromboembolism. Deviation in the INR has been shown to be the strongest risk factor for bleeding complications. The major routes of metabolism of warfarin are by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Some of the compounds, which have been identified to influence positively or negatively warfarin\u2019s INR, include cimetidine, clofibrate, propranolol, celecoxib (a competitive inhibition of CYP2C9), fluvoxamine (an inhibitor of several CYP enzymes), various antifungals and antibiotics (e.g., miconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin), omeprazole, alcohol, ginseng, and garlic. Researchers have determined that the majority of individual patient variation observed clinically in response to warfarin therapy is genetic in nature, influenced by the genetic variability of metabolizing enzymes, vitamin K cycle enzymes, and possibly transporter proteins. The CYP2C9 genotype polymorphisms alone explain about 10 % of the variability observed in the warfarin maintenance dose. Figure 8.5 shows the proteins involved in warfarin action and indicates the pharmacogenomic variants that more significantly influence warfarin therapy optimal outcome.\n\n",

However, the CYP2C9 genotype polymorphisms alone only explain about 10 % of the variability observed in the warfarin maintenance dose. Warfarin effectiveness is also influenced by the genetic variability of vitamin K cycle enzymes. The drug receptor for warfarin is generally recognized as vitamin K epoxide reductase, the enzyme that recycles vitamin K in the coagulation cascade. Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex1 (VKORC1) has been determined to be highly variant with as much as 50 % of the clinical variability observed for warfarin resulting from polymorphisms of this enzyme.",

As described above, targeted cancer therapies such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) are successful and are viewed as the way of the future. Also, clinically important polymorphisms predict increased toxicity in patients with cancer being treated with the chemotherapeutic drugs, for example, 6-mercaptopurine (thiopurine methyltransferase *2, *3A, and *3C variants), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase *2A variant), and irinotecan (UGT1A1*28 allele; FDA-approved Invader UGT1A1 Molecular Assay diagnostic available to screen for presence of this allele associated with irinotecan toxicity) (Kolesar 2009). Likewise, clinically important pharmacogenetics predicts efficacy in oncology patients treated with 5-FU (thymidylate synthase *2 and *3C variants) (Petros and Sharma 2009).",

These drugs are metabolized by the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) to the inactive S-methylated products. Gene mutations (polymorphisms) may occur in as many as 11 % of patients resulting in decreased TPMT-mediated metabolism of the thiopurine drugs. A diagnostic test for TPMT is now available and used clinically. Identified patients with poor TPMT metabolism may need their drug dose lowered 10\u201315-fold. Mechanisms of multidrug resistance to cancer drugs are influenced by genetic differences. A number of polymorphisms in the MDR-1 gene coding for P-glycoprotein, the transmembrane protein drug efflux pump responsible for multidrug resistance, have been identified. One, known as the T/T genotype and correlated with decreased intestinal expression of P-glycoprotein and increased drug bioavailability, has an allele frequency of 88 % in African-American populations, yet only approximately 50 % in Caucasian-American populations (Kolesar 2009).",

While it is great for the advancement of the genomic sciences, some have questioned how good it is for patients at this stage of its development due to exaggerated claims falling short of the predictive and preventative healthcare paradigm promised (Browman et al. 2011; Nature Biotechnology Editorial Staff 2012). The pace of advancement has been slower than promised (Zuckerman and Milne 2012). There are also economic, societal, and ethical issues that must be addressed to successfully implement genetic testing-based individualized pharmacotherapy (Huston 2010). It is fair to state that most drugs will not be effective in all patients all of the time. Thus, the pressure of payers to move from a \u201cpayment for product\u201d to a \u201cpayment for clinically significant health outcomes\u201d model is reasonable. The use of omic health technologies and health informatics approaches to stratify patient populations for drug effectiveness and drug safety is a laudable goal. However, the technologies are currently quite expensive and the resulting drug response predictability is now just being validated clinically. Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses are limited at this date (Chalkidou and Rawlins 2011). Also, the resulting environment created by these technologies in the context of outcomes expectations and new drug access/reimbursement models will give rise to a new pharmaceutical business paradigm that is still evolving and not well understood.",

Omic technologies were not generally involved in the development and approval process. Based on the analysis of health statistics suggesting that the rate of mortality in blacks with heart disease is twice as high in whites in the 45\u201364 age group, a clinical trial of this older drug combination in 1,050 African-Americans was conducted and the 43 % improvement in survival in the treatment arm resulted in FDA approval of the drug exclusively in African-Americans. Yet, modern anthropology and genetics have shown that while race does exist as a real social construct, there are no genetically distinguishable human racial groups (Ossorio 2004). Thus, attributing observed differences in biomedical outcomes and phenotypical observations to genetic differences among races is problematic and ethically challenging. Race is likely just a surrogate marker for the environmental and genetic causes of disease and response to pharmacotherapy. Now, factor in the introduction of omic technologies broadly into healthcare in a manner to segregate patient populations based on genomic and proteomic characteristics. It is obvious that these modern technologies pose provocative consequences for public policy (including data protection, insurability, and access to care), and these challenges must be addressed by decision makers, scientists, healthcare providers, and the public for personalized medicine to be successful (for further insight into this complex area, please read Brazeau and Brazeau 2011c). In conclusion, even with challenges and questioned progress, personalized medicine is a global concern and an unprecedented opportunity if the science and the clinic can both succeed.",

            "text": "DNA is the heritable biomolecule that contains the genetic information resulting in phenotype from parent to offspring. Modern genomics, GWAS and SNP analyses, confirm this and identify genetic variants that may be associated with a different phenotype. However, genome-level information alone does not generally predict phenotype at an individual level (Daxinger and Whitelaw 2012). For instance, researchers and clinicians have known for some time that an individual\u2019s response to a drug is affected by their genetic makeup (DNA sequence, genotype) and a set of disease and environmental characteristics working alone or in concert to determine that response. Research in animal models has suggested that in addition to DNA sequence, there are a number of other \u201clevels\u201d of information that influence transcription of genomic information. As you are aware, every person\u2019s body contains trillions of cells, all of which have essentially the same genome and, therefore, the same genes. Yet some cells are optimized for development into one or more of the 200+ specialized cells that make up our bodies: muscles, bones, brain, etc. For this to transpire from within the same genome, some genes must be turned on or off at different points of cell development in different cell types to affect gene expression, protein production, and cell differentiation, growth, and function. There is a rapidly evolving field of research known as epigenetics (or epigenomics) that can be viewed as a conduit between genotype and phenotype. Epigenetics literally means \u201cabove genetics or over the genetic sequence.\u201d It is the factor or factors that influence cell behavior by means other than via a direct effect on the genetic machinery. Epigenetic regulation includes DNA methylation and covalent histone modifications (Fig. 8.6) and is mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene expression that result without a change in DNA sequence (Berger et al. 2009). Epigenomics is the merged science of genomics and epigenetics (Raghavachari 2012). Functionally, epigenetics acts to regulate gene expression, gene silencing during genomic imprinting, apoptosis, X-chromosome inactivation, and tissue-specific gene activation (such as maintenance of stem cell pluripotency) (Garske and Denu 2009).\n\n",

Epigenetics/epigenomics may also explain low association predictors found in some pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic studies. Etiology of disease, such as cancer, likely involves both genetic variants and epigenetic modifications that could result from environmental effects (Bjornsson et al. 2004; Jirtle and Skinner 2007). Age also likely influences epigenetic modifications as studies of identical twins show greater differences in global DNA methylation in older rather than younger sets of twins (Feinberg et al. 2010). Abnormal epigenetic regulation is likely a feature of complex diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease (Chen and Zhang 2011; Hamm and Costa 2011; Rakyan et al. 2011). Therefore, epigenetics targets are being explored for drug design, especially those observed in cancer (Woster 2010). The first generation of FDA-approved epigenetics-based drugs is available with two DNA demethylating agents (5-azacytidine and decitabine) and two histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (vorinostat and romidepsin). These have been approved mainly for the treatment of blood cancers, in particularly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).",

Another mechanism of epigenomic control appears to occur at the level of chromatin. In the cell, DNA is wrapped around 8 different histone proteins to form chromatin. Packaging of DNA into chromatin can render large regions of the DNA inaccessible and prevent processes such as DNA transcription from occurring. Epigenetic regulation of histone proteins can be by chemical modification including acetylation, methylation, sumoylation and ubiquitylation (Herceg and Murr 2011). Each can cause structural changes in chromatin affecting DNA accessibility. Non-protein-coding RNAs, known as ncRNAs, have also been shown to contribute to epigenetic regulation as have mRNAs which can be processed and participate in various interference pathways (Collins and Schonfeld 2011).",

Using such methods, it would then theoretically possible to test an individual patient for his or her susceptibility to these adverse effects before prescribing a medication. Patients that would show the marker for an adverse effect would be switched to a different drug. Therefore, toxicogenomics will become increasingly more powerful in predicting toxicity as new biomarkers are identified and validated.

Many of the therapeutically used recombinant DNA-produced proteins are glycosylated including erythropoietin, glucocerebrosidase, and tissue plasminogen activator. Without the appropriate carbohydrates attached, none of these proteins will function therapeutically as does the parent glycoprotein. Glycoforms (variations of the glycosylation pattern of a glycoprotein) of the same protein may differ in physicochemical and biochemical properties. For example, erythropoietin has one O-linked and three N-linked glycosylation sites. The removal of the terminal sugars at each site destroys in vivo activity and removing all sugars results in a more rapid clearance of the molecule and a shorter circulatory half-life (Takeuchi et al. 1990). Yet, the opposite effect is observed for the deglycosylation of the hematopoietic cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Cebon et al. 1990). In that case, removing the carbohydrate residues increases the specific activity sixfold. The sugars of glycoproteins are known to play a role in the recognition and binding of biomolecules to other molecules in disease states such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, HIV infection, the flu, and other infectious diseases.",

Biology has become an information science defining all the elements in a complex biological system and placing them in a database for comparative interpretation. As seen in Fig. 8.2, the hierarchy of information collection goes well beyond the biodata contained in the genetic code that is transcribed and translated. Systems biology involves a generally complex interactive system. This research area is often described as a noncompetitive or precompetitive technology by the pharmaceutical industry because it is believed to be a foundational technology that must be better developed to be successful at the competitive technology of drug discovery and development. It is the study of the interactions between the components of a biological system and how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system. Systems biology is essential for our understanding of how all the individual parts of intricate biological networks are organized and function in living cells. The biological system may involve enzymes and metabolites in a metabolic pathway or other interacting biological molecules affecting a biological process. Molecular biologists have spent the past 50+ years teasing apart cellular pathways down to the molecular level. Characterized by a cycle of theory, computational modeling, and experiment to quantitatively describe cells or cell processes, systems biology is a data-intensive endeavor that results in a conceptual framework for the analysis and understanding of complex biological systems in varying contexts (Rothberg et al. 2005; Klipp et al. 2005; Meyer et al. 2011). Statistical mining, data alignment, probabilistic and mathematical modeling, and data visualization into networks are among the mathematical models employed to integrate the data and assemble the systems network (Gehlenborg et al. 2010). New measurements are stored with existing data, including extensive functional annotations, in molecular databases, and model assembly provides libraries of network models (Schrattenholz et al. 2010).",

The transgene contains both the DNA encoding the desired target amino acid sequence along with regulatory sequences that will mediate the expression of the added gene. The microinjected eggs are then implanted into the reproductive tract of a female and allowed to develop into embryos. The foreign DNA generally becomes randomly inserted at a single site on just one of the host chromosomes (i.e., the founder transgenic animal is heterozygous). Thus, each transgenic founder animal (positive transgene incorporated animals) is a unique species. Interbreeding of founder transgenic animals where the transgene has been incorporated into germ cells may result in the birth of a homozygous progeny provided the transgene incorporation did not induce a mutation of an essential endogenous gene. All cells of the transgenic animal will contain the transgene if DNA insertion occurs prior to the first cell division. However, usually only 20\u201325 % of the offspring contain detectable levels of the transgene. Selection of neonatal animals possessing an incorporated transgene can readily be accomplished either by the direct identification of specific DNA or mRNA sequences or by the observation of gross phenotypic characteristics.\n\n",

Many of the experimental human gene therapy trials employ the same viral vectors. Advantages of this method of transgene production are the ease with which genes can be introduced into embryos at various stages of development, and the characteristic that only a single copy of the transgene is usually integrated into the genome. Disadvantages include possible genetic recombination of the viral vector with other viruses present, the size limitation of the introduced DNA (up to 7 kb of DNA, less than the size of some genes), and the difficulty in preparing certain viral vectors.",

ES cell technology is more efficient at creating transgenics than microinjection protocols. ES cells, a cultured cell line derived from the inner cell mass (blastocyst) of a blastocyte (early preimplantation embryo), are capable of having their genomic DNA modified while retaining their ability to contribute to both somatic and germ cell lineages. The desired gene is incorporated into ES cells by one of several methods such as microinjection. This is followed by introduction of the genetically modified ES cells into the blastocyst of an early preimplantation embryo, selection, and culturing of targeted ES cells which are transferred subsequently to the reproductive tract of the surrogate host animal. The resulting progeny is screened for evidence that the desired genetic modification is present and selected appropriately. In mice, the process results in approximately 30 % of the progeny containing tissue genetically derived from the incorporated ES cells. Interbreeding of selected founder animals can produce species homozygous for the mutation.\n\n",

The gene insertion could occur in a random or in a targeted process. Nonhomologous recombination, a random process, readily occurs if the desired DNA is introduced into the ES cell genome by a gene recombination process that does not require any sequence homology between genomic DNA and the foreign DNA. While most ES cells fail to insert the foreign DNA, some do. Those that do are selected and injected into the inner cell mass of the animal blastocyst and thus eventually lead to a transgenic species. In still far fewer ES cells, homologous recombination occurs by chance. Segments of DNA base sequence in the vector find homologous sequences in the host genome, and the region between these homologous sequences replaces the matching region in the host DNA. A significant advance in the production of transgenic animals in ES cells is the advent of targeted homologous recombination techniques.",

            "text": "The science of cloning and the resulting ethical debate surrounding it is well beyond the scope of this chapter. Yet it is important to place the concept of animal cloning within the pharmaceutically important context of transgenic animal production. The technique of microinjection (and its variations) has formed the basis for commercial transgenic animal production. While successful, the microinjection process is limited to the creation of only a small number of transgenic animals in a given birth. The slow process of conventional breeding of the resulting transgenic progeny must follow to produce a larger number of transgenic animals with the same transgene as the original organism. To generate a herd (or a flock, etc.), an alternative approach would be advantageous. The technique of nuclear transfer, the replacement of the nuclear genomic DNA of an oocyte (immature egg) or a single-cell fertilized embryo with that from a donor cell, is such an alternative breeding methodology. Animal \u201ccloning\u201d can result from this nuclear transfer technology. Judged the journal Science\u2019s most important breakthrough of 1997 creating the sheep Dolly, the first cloned mammal, from a single cell of a 6-year old ewe was a feat many had thought impossible. Dolly was born after nuclear transfer of the genome from an adult mammary gland cell (Khan 2012a). Since this announcement, commercial and exploratory development of nuclear transfer technology has progressed rapidly with various species cloned. It is important to note that the cloned sheep Dolly was NOT a transgenic animal. While Dolly was a clone of an adult ewe, she did not possess a transgene. However, cloning could be used to breed clones of transgenic animals or to directly produce transgenic animals (if prior to nuclear transfer, a transgene was inserted into the genome of the cloning donor). For example, human factor IX (a blood factor protein) transgenic sheep was generated by nuclear transfer from transfected fetal fibroblasts (Schniecke et al. 1997). Several of the resulting progeny were shown to be transgenic (i.e., possessing the human factor IX gene), and one was named Polly. Thus, animal cloning can be utilized not only for breeding but also for the production of potential human therapeutic proteins and other useful pharmaceutical products (Shultz et al. 2007).",

The success of human-to-human transplantation of heart, kidney, liver, and other vascularized organs (allotransplantation) created the significant expectation and need for donor organs. Primate-to-human transplantation (xenotransplantation) was successful, but ethical issues and limited number of donor animals were significant barriers. Transplant surgeons recognized early on that organs from the pig were a rational choice for xenotransplantation (due to physiological, anatomical, ethical, and supply reasons) if the serious hyperacute rejection could be overcome. Several research groups in academia and industry have pioneered the transgenic engineering of pigs expressing both human complement inhibitory proteins and key human blood group proteins (antigens) (McCurry et al. 1995; Dunn et al. 2005; Van Eyck et al. 2010). Cloning has now produced transgenic pigs for xenotransplantation. Cells, tissues, and organs from these double transgenic animals appear to be very resistant to the humoral immune system-mediated reactions of both primates and likely humans. These findings begin to pave the way for potential xenograft transplantation of animal components into humans with a lessened chance of acute rejection. A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have shorter life spans than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate.",

Mice are the laboratory animal species most closely related to humans in which the knockout technique can be easily performed, so they are a favorite subject for knockout experiments. While a mouse carrying an introduced transgene is called a transgenic mouse, transgenic technologies can also produce a knockout animal. A knockout mouse, also called a gene knockout mouse or a gene-targeted knockout mouse, is an animal in which an endogenous gene (genomic wild-type allele) has been specifically inactivated by replacing it with a null allele (Sharpless and DePinho 2006; Wu et al. 2011b; Clark and Pazdernik 2012b). A null allele is a nonfunctional allele of a gene generated by either deletion of the entire gene or mutation of the gene resulting in the synthesis of an inactive protein. Recent advances in intranuclear gene targeting and embryonic stem cell technologies as described above are expanding the capabilities to produce knockout mice routinely for studying certain human genetic diseases or elucidating the function of a specific gene product.",

Incorporation is generally quite low; approximately one cell in a million has the required gene replacement. However, the process is designed to impart neomycin and ganciclovir resistance only to those ES cells in which homologous gene integration has resulted. This facilitates the selection and propagation of the correctly engineered ES cells. The resulting ES cells are then injected into early mouse embryos creating chimeric mice (heterozygous for the knockout allele) containing tissues derived from both host cells and ES cells. The chimeric mice are mated to confirm that the null allele is incorporated into the germ line. The confirmed heterozygous chimeric mice are bred to homogeneity producing progeny that are homozygous knockout mice. Worldwide, three major mouse knockout programs are proceeding in collaboration to create a mutation in each of the approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes in the mouse genome using a combination of gene trapping and gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Staff 2007). These include (1) KOMP (KnockOut Mouse Project, http://www.knockoutmouse.org), funded by the NIH; (2) EUCOMM (EUropean Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program, http://www.eucomm.org), funded by the FP6 program of the EC; and (3) NorCOMM (North American Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Project, http://norcomm.phenogenomics.ca/index.htm), a Canadian project funded by Genome Canada and partners.

Mouse, rat, and zebra fish are the most common models explored and used. Genetic engineering can predispose an animal to a particular disease under scrutiny, and the insertion of human genes into the animal can initiate the development of a more clinically relevant disease condition. In human clinical studies, assessments of efficacy and safety often rely on measured effects for surrogate biomarkers and adverse event reporting. Validated transgenic animal models of human disease allow for parallel study and possible predictability prior to entering clinical trials. Also, it is possible to screen potential drug candidates in vivo against a human receptor target inserted into an animal model. The number of examples of transgenic animal models of human disease useful in drug discovery and development efforts is growing rapidly (Sharpless and DePinho 2006; Schultz et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2011b; Clark and Pazdernik 2012b).

Synthetic biology looks at both the strategic redesign and/or the fabrication of existing biological systems and the design and construction of biological components and systems that do not already exist in nature (Khalil and Collins 2010). Synthetic genomics is a subset of synthetic biology that focuses on the redesign and fabrication of new genetic material constructed from raw chemicals. The focus of synthetic biology is often on ways of taking parts of natural biological systems, characterizing and simplifying them, and using them as a component of a highly unnatural, engineered, biological system. Synthetic biology studies may provide a more detailed understanding of complex biological systems down to the molecular level. Being able to design and construct a complex system is also one very practical approach to understanding that system under various conditions.

Terpenoids are a highly diverse class of lipophilic natural products that have historically provided a rich source for discovery of pharmacologically active small molecules, such as the anticancer agent paclitaxel (Taxol) and the antimalarial artemisinin. Unfortunately, these secondary metabolites are typically produced in low abundance in their host organism, and their isolation consequently suffers from low yields and high consumption of natural resources. A key step is developing methods to carry out cytochrome P450 (P450)-based oxidation chemistry in vivo. Their work suggests that potentially, entire metabolic pathways can be designed in silico and constructed in bacterial hosts.",

Typically, a reporter gene, that is a reporter that indicates the presence or absence of a particular gene product that in turn reflects the changes in a biological process or pathway, is transfected into a desired cell. When the gene product is expressed in the living cell, the reporter gene is transcribed and the reporter is translated to yield a protein that is measured biochemically.

True combinatorial chemistry or sometimes referred to as combichem, applies methods to substantially reduce the number of synthetic operations or steps needed to synthesize large numbers of compounds. Combichem is conducted on solid supports (resins) to facilitate the manipulations required to reduce labor during purification of multiple products in the same vessel. Differing from combinatorial chemistry, multiple parallel synthesis procedures apply automation to the synthetic process to address the many separate reaction vessels needed, but the number of operations needed to carry out a synthesis is practically the same as the conventional approach. Thus, the potential productivity of multiple parallel methods is not as high as combinatorial chemistries. Parallel chemistries can be conducted on solid-phase supports or in solution to facilitate purification. Figure 8.12 provides an illustration of a combinatorial mix-and-match process in which a simple building block (a starting material such as an amino acid, peptide, heterocycle, other small molecule, etc.) is joined to one or more other simple building blocks in every possible combination. Assigning the task to automated synthesizing equipment results in the rapid creation of large collections or libraries (as large as 10,000 compounds) of diverse molecules. Ingenious methods have been devised to direct the molecules to be synthesized, to identify the structure of the products, to purify the products via automation, and to isolate compounds. When coupled with high-throughput screening, thousands of compounds can be generated, screened, and evaluated for further development in a matter of weeks.\n\n",

As part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap for Biomedical Research, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) will lead an effort to offer public sector biomedical researchers access to libraries of small organic molecules that can be used as chemical probes to study cellular pathways in greater depth. It remains difficult to predict which small molecule compounds will be most effective in a given situation. Researchers can maximize the likelihood of a successful match between a chemical compound, its usefulness as a research tool, and its desired therapeutic effect by systematically screening libraries containing thousands of small molecules. Drug candidates are expected from the correlations observed during functional analysis of the molecule \u2013 gene product interactions. Genomic profiling by the chemical library may also yield relevant new targets and mechanisms. Chemical genomics is expected to be a critical component of drug lead identification and proof of principle determination for selective modulators of complex enzyme systems including proteases, kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors, and nuclear receptors.",

The best-characterized human polymorphisms are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring approximately once every 1,000 bases in the 3.5 billion base pair human genome.Pharmacogenetics is the study of how an individual\u2019s genetic differences influence drug action, usage, and dosing. A detailed knowledge of a patient\u2019s pharmacogenetics in relation to a particular drug therapy may lead to enhanced efficacy and greater safety. While sometimes used interchangeably (especially in pharmacy practice literature), pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are subtly different. Pharmacogenomics introduces the additional element of our present technical ability to pinpoint patient-specific DNA variation using genomic techniques. While overlapping fields of study, pharmacogenomics is a much newer term that correlates an individual patient\u2019s DNA variation (SNP level of variation knowledge rather than gene level of variation knowledge) with his or her response to pharmacotherapy.The field of metabonomics is the holistic study of the metabolic continuum at the equivalent level to the study of genomics and proteomics.The biochips known as DNA microarrays and oligonucleotide microarrays are a surface collection of hundreds to thousands of immobilized DNA sequences or oligonucleotides in a grid created with specialized equipment that can be simultaneously examined to conduct expression analysis.Genomic variation affects not only the pharmacokinetic profile of drugs (via drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporter proteins), it also strongly influences the pharmacodynamic profile of drugs via the drug target.Pharmacotherapy informed by a patient\u2019s individual genomic and proteomic information. Sometimes referred to as giving the right drug to the right patient in the right dose at the right time.Biomarkers are clinically relevant substances used as indicators of a biologic state. Detection or concentration change of a biomarker may indicate a particular disease state physiology or toxicity. A change in expression or state of a protein biomarker may correlate with the risk or progression of a disease, with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment or the drug\u2019s safety profile.Systems biology is the study of the interactions between the components of a biological system, and how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system.Engineered animal models are proving invaluable since small animal models of disease are often poor mimics of that disease in human patients. Genetic engineering can predispose an animal to a particular disease under scrutiny, and the insertion of human genes into the animal can initiate the development of a more clinically relevant disease condition.(a) DNA microinjection and random gene addition and (b) homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells.A knockout mouse, also called a gene knockout mouse or a gene-targeted knockout mouse, is an animal in which an endogenous gene (genomic wild-type allele) has been specifically inactivated by replacing it with a null allele.There are two overall approaches to high-throughput synthesis. True combinatorial chemistry applies methods to substantially reduce the number of synthetic operations or steps needed to synthesize large numbers of compounds.
