Wild parrot populations have declined over recent decades, with nearly 30% of 355 species currently threatened with extinction (Donald et al., 2010). Although among the most threatened bird orders in the world (Juniper and Parr, 1998), detailed studies on the (un-)sustainability of parrot harvesting and trading are lacking (Beissinger and Bucher, 1992; Gilardi and James, 2006), as are studies evaluating parrot welfare when held or bred in captivity, given that they are comparably intelligent and long-lived birds (Meehan and Mench, 2006; Engebretson, 2006), prone to traumatic stress (Yenkosky et al., 2010).",

            "text": "In Mexico, Europe and the USA, certain parrot species command a premium price, linked to striking coloration or rarity. This leads to a disproportionate number of these most expensive species being poached from the wild (Tella and Hiraldo, 2014). However, price creates a balance between supply and demand; when desirable goods are expensive, trade volumes are typically lower, causing sales volumes to self-regulate (Harris et al., 2015). For example, the price of pangolin products is increasing, seemingly due to desirability driving ever-greater consumer demand in China and Vietnam, with supply restricted by regulation and risk of prosecution (Challender et al., 2015). Consumer sensitivity to price (price elasticity of demand, PED) is quantified as the relative percentage change in quantities purchased in response to a one percent change in price (Walelign et al., 2019). PED further divides into Perfectly Elastic Demand (\u221e), Perfectly Inelastic Demand (0), Relatively Elastic Demand (>1), Relatively Inelastic Demand (<1), and Unitary Elasticity Demand (= 1). Phylogenetic path analyses enable a more expansive analysis of quality-quantity wildlife trade dynamics (Hardenberg and Gonzalez-Voyer, 2013; Gonzalez-Voyer and Von Hardenberg, 2014). This method can account for species non-independence due to shared ancestry, and describe dependencies within sets of variables.",

This is despite all recorded sales likely being in contravention of China's Wild Animal Conservation Law (WACL) and CITES. We studied fixed\u2013price classified transactions involving parrots over Taobao.com (a subsidiary of the Alibaba group; analogous to \u2018Ebay\u2019) that provides the largest domestic consumer to consumer (C2C) online platform in Mainland China. We then tested for possible correlations between sale volume per species across surveys (the dependent variable) as predicted by price, and indices relating to conservation status, extent of occurrence, morphological traits and breeding potential. Note: Su et al. (2015) found that song complexity was not a desirable trait motivating parrot sales. Based on pre-specified candidate path models, we used phylogenetic confirmatory path analysis to model how co-dependent factors influence sales volumes. We use these findings to comment on ways to improve parrot trade management.",

We applied the search criteria \u201cparrot, living\u201d (in Chinese). We amassed 44,597 screenshots of illegal advertisements of parrots listed in China's List of Fauna under Special State Protection (1989) and/or CITES Appendices I, II. Transaction information included \u2018species\u2019 (verified from the sellers' description and photographs), \u2018unit price\u2019 (i.e. price per single item) and \u2018successful transactions\u2019, which provided the number of individual animals traded and received during the 30 days preceding our survey (1 transaction = 1 animal traded; Ye et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) (Fig. 1\n). According to the annotations provided by some vendors, despite variations in size (and value) all parrot species could be shipped to consumers across China via express delivery for a standard fee scaled by parcel size and shipping distance, except to buyers in remote areas in Tibet and Xinjiang, where more expensive charges applied. We selected price data randomly from no more than ten advertisements per species. Mean price per species was converted into US dollars (US$1:RMB\u00a56.759) and compared with trade volumes across surveys. We excluded species where fewer than 3 individuals were sold across surveys to increase the reliability of our dataset and ensure that general trends would not be skewed by the attributes of a few aberrant individuals.",

Our dataset included species classified as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 (Status = 1), \u2018near threatened\u2019 (Status = 2), vulnerable (Status = 3), and endangered (Status = 4), but did not include any species classified as \u2018Data Deficient\u2019, \u2018Critically Endangered\u2019, \u2018Extinct in the Wild\u2019 or \u2018Extinct\u2019. Red List status is an ordinal categorization of an underlying continuous variable; however, our phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLSs) analysis required continuous response variables (Martins and Hansen, 1997). We thus assumed that this status (coded as indicated above) reflected continuous variation in vulnerability to extinction (following Purvis et al., 2000; Fritz et al., 2009; Gonzalez-Voyer et al., 2016).ii)Extent of occurrence (km2): a measure was defined as the area contained within the shortest continuous boundary encompassing all the known, inferred, or projected sites of present occurrence of a taxon, excluding vagrancy, acquired from BirdLife International (2019).iii)Morphological traits: Plumage color from scanned images of adult male parrots from Parrots (Juniper and Parr, 1998) was converted from RGB L*a*b* color mode to Lab color mode using Adobe Photoshop CS6 software, based on the human perception of color (International Commission on Illumination, 1976). Body mass (grams) for each species was obtained from Iwaniuk et al. (2005) and the Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive (del Hoyo et al., 2019, HBW). Lengths of wing, tail, bill and tarsus were obtained from Parrots (Juniper and Parr, 1998) applying residuals from observed minus predicted lengths based on log-log regression controlling for body mass effect. Relative (allometrically scaled) brain size was taken from Sayol et al. (2018), as a proxy of ability to exhibit novel behavior (Lefebvre et al., 1997; Overington et al., 2009).iv)Breeding potential: Clutch size (number of eggs per brood) and generation length (inter-cohort period, in years) were obtained from HBW (2019) and (Encyclopedia of Life, 2014) websites, respectively.\n",

Under China's criminal law, any participants in illegal wildlife trade supply chains, to include hunters, sellers, buyer and/or transporters, could face up to 15 years fixed-term imprisonment accompanied by fines and/or the confiscation of property (see Zhou et al., 2016 for the detailed cascade of legal jurisdiction and penalties). Allowing parrot trading to continue in contravention of existing laws, emboldens other wild animal trade, and signals an unclear ethical position. The consequences of such failures to obey animal trading laws in China have, tragically, been brought into focus by the COVID-19 pandemic, with dire consequences for human health (Zhou et al., 2020). Indeed, parrots are susceptible to a number of infectious zoonotic diseases. For example, 35.37% of 311 parrots investigated from North China were Chlamydia psittaci seropositive (Zhang et al., 2015), causing psittacosis, or \u2018parrot fever\u2019 in humans (Eidson, 2002; Smith et al., 2005).",

For example, Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) is a potentially deadly disease among parrots, cockatoos and lorikeets (non-zoonotic). This has been widely detected among wild, wild-caught captive and seized parrots across countries (Peters et al., 2014; Fogell et al., 2018) and can quickly spread through poorly kept parrot breeding facilities (Rahaus and Wolff, 2003). It seems probable that those more expensive parrot species, representing a considerable financial investment for breeders or consumers, may receive better welfare as a result of their value, where companion animals with a higher monetary value are often better cared for (Vermeulen and Odendaal, 1993); however, the cumulative compromised welfare of smaller, less valuable species may be considerable (Pires, 2012).",
