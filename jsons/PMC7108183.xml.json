These fractions were plotted against the respective virus concentrations in each sample and analyzed by probit analysis (n = 30 replicate datum points per concentration). With the exception of 1 outlier sample, the positivity rate of each sample corresponded exactly with the concentration-dependent response rates calculated by a dose\u2013response model (probit analysis, P \u2264 0.0001). When the outlier was eliminated, the hypothetical average laboratory achieved 50% detection probability from 7762 copies of RNA/mL of sample onward (95% CI, 1174\u201324547 copies/mL). The outlier sample was the only member of the panel belonging to WNV genetic lineage 2 (strain WNV-Ug37). For this sample, the hit rate was 43.3%, less than half the rate predicted by the regression model. In 10 laboratories, the lineage 2 sample could not be detected, although a lineage 1 sample of 10 times less virus (1.8 \u00d7 105 copies/mL) tested positive. For WNV-Kunjin, which is an outlier within lineage 1 (designated lineage 1b), a genotype bias was not observed. The WNV-Kunjin detection rate of 36.7% corresponded well with the dose\u2013response model, because it had a low virus concentration of 2600 copies/mL (Fig. 1 ). It should be mentioned, however, that we did not make a direct comparison of detection rates for genotype 1a. In addition, no significant differences were observed between the detection rates of the North American NY99 WNV prototype strain and the WNV PaAn001 strain that was isolated from an animal in France in 2000 (2)(13). Both strains belong to lineage 1a.",

First, the 6 samples containing 1.8 \u00d7 104 or more copies of viral RNA/mL had to be correctly detected as positive (Table 1 ). This concentration was chosen because it was well within the detection interval of published and commercial RT-PCR assays for WNV (e.g., (4)(14)(15). Second, no false-positive results were allowed for the 2 negative samples. When we applied these criteria, only 8 of 30 laboratories (27%) passed the minimum requirements for successful participation. All other laboratories failed because of lack of sensitivity, not because of false-positive results (Table 1 ). Six of the 8 successful laboratories also detected the low copy number sample, containing WNV-Kunjin at 2600 copies/mL. Two laboratories missed the proficiency criteria only because the 1.8 \u00d7 104 copies/mL lineage 1 sample was not detected. Nine laboratories failed to detect the lineage 2 sample but detected all other samples correctly. One laboratory missed only 1 of the high-titered samples, an omission that may have been caused by a handling error. The remaining laboratories missed more than 1 sample. One laboratory provided no correct result at all.",

Compared with our earlier EQA studies on emerging agents such as Ebola, Lassa, Pox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses (16)(17), in this study the overall diagnostic performance for WNV appears disappointing. From a technical point of view, much lower detection limits, in the range of 100-1000 copies/mL, can be achieved in RT-PCR, and some of our participants will indeed reach this concentration. The average laboratory, however, was not as efficient, and only a small number of participants passed a rather easy set of proficiency criteria, a critical problem because maximum sensitivity is required in clinical cases of encephalitis, in blood screening, and in testing reservoir components such as mosquitoes.",

Without the lineage 2 sample, 60% of participants would have passed the proficiency criteria. Because lineage 1 is far more prevalent in general and in the Northern Hemisphere in particular, it is conceivable that many participants may have designed their assays according to their own geographic location, a situation that would be acceptable in most settings. Several other laboratories may have detected lineage 2 only by broad-range flavivirus assays, as suggested by the observed correlation between non-WNV flavivirus detection and lineage 2 results. In view of recent findings on the presence of lineage 2 WNV and potentially new lineages 3 and 4 in Europe (1)(18)(19), the importance of using broad-range assays is obvious. At least on the reference laboratory level, broad-range flavivirus assays should routinely be applied in parallel with specific WNV detection.",
