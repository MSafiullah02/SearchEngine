            "text": "In 1955, Niu and Frankel-Conrat published the C-terminal amino acid sequence of tobacco mosaic virus capsid protein. The complete 158-amino-acid sequence of this protein was published in 1960. The first completely sequenced viral genome published was that of bacteriophage MS2 in 1976 (GenBank accession number V00642). Sanger used DNA from bacteriophage phiX174 (J02482) in developing the dideoxy sequencing method, while the first animal viral genome, SV40 (J02400), was sequenced using the Maxam and Gilbert method and published in 1978. Viruses therefore played a pivotal role in the development of modern-day sequencing methods, and viral sequence information (both protein and nucleotide) formed a substantial subset of the earliest available biological databases. In 1965, Margaret O. Dayhoff published the first publicly available database of biological sequence information. This Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure was available only in printed form and contained the sequences of approximately 50 proteins. Establishment of a database of nucleic acid sequences began in 1979 through the efforts of Walter Goad at the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and separately at the European Molecular Biology Laboratories (EMBL) in the early 1980s. In 1982, the LANL database received funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was christened GenBank. In December of 1981, the Los Alamos Sequence Library contained 263 sequences of which 50 were from eukaryotic viruses and 12 were from bacteriophages. By its tenth release in 1983, GenBank contained 1865 sequences (1 827 214 nucleotides) of which 449 (457 721 nucleotides) were viral. In August of 2006, GenBank (release 154) contained approximately 59 000 000 records, including 367 000 viral sequences.",

In addition, other high-throughput technologies have been developed in recent years, such as those for gene expression and proteomic studies. All of these technologies generate enormous new data sets at ever-increasing rates. The challenge, therefore, has been to provide computational systems that support the storage, retrieval, analysis, and display of this information so that the research scientist can take advantage of this wealth of resources to ask and answer questions relevant to his or her work. Every article in this encyclopedia contains knowledge that has been derived in part from the analysis of large data sets. The ability to effectively and efficiently utilize these data sets is directly dependent on the databases that have been developed to support storage of this information. Fortunately, the continual development and improvement of data-intensive biological technologies has been matched by the development and improvement of computational technologies. This work, which includes both the development and utilization of databases as well as tools for storage and analysis of biological information, forms a very important part of the bioinformatics field. This article provides an overview of database structure and how that structure supports the storage of biological information. The different types of data associated with the analysis of viruses are discussed, followed by a review of some of the various online databases that store general biological information as well as virus-specific information.",

For many of us, lab notebook fulfilled our initial need for a \u2018database\u2019. However, this information storage vehicle did not prove to be an ideal place to archive our data. Backups were difficult, and retrieval more so. The advent of computers \u2013 especially the desktop computer \u2013 provided a new solution to the problem of data storage. Though initially this innovation took the form of spreadsheets and electronic notebooks, the subsequent development of both personal and large-scale database systems provided a much more robust solution to the problems of data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The computer program supplying this functionality is called a \u2018database management system\u2019 (DBMS). Such systems provide at least four things: (1) the necessary computer code to guide a user through the process of database design; (2) a computer language that can be used to insert, manipulate, and query the data; (3) tools that allow the data to be exported in a variety of formats for sharing and distribution; and (4) the administrative functions necessary to ensure data integrity, security, and backup. However, regardless of the sophistication and diverse functions available in a typical modern DBMS, it is still up to the user to provide the proper context for data storage. The database must be properly designed to ensure that it supports the structure of the data being stored and also supports the types of queries and manipulations necessary to fully understand and efficiently analyze the properties of the data.",

While databases can store data in any number of different formats, the design of the particular schema used for a project is dependent on the data and the needs and expertise of the individuals creating, maintaining, and using the database. As an example, we will explore some of the possible formats for storing viral sequence data and provide examples of the database schema that could be used for such a project.",

In this format, the relationships between each piece of information and every other piece of information are only implicitly defined, that is, each line starts with a label that describes the information in the rest of the line, but it is up to the investigator reading the record to make all of the proper connections between each of the data fields (lines). The proper connections are not explicitly defined in this record. As trained scientists, we are able to read the record in Figure 1(a) and discern that this particular amino acid sequence is derived from a strain of Ebola virus that was studied by a group in Germany, and that this sequence codes for a protein that functions as the virus RNA polymerase. The format of this record was carefully designed to allow us, or a computer, to pull out each individual type of information. However as trained scientists, we already understand the proper connections between the different information fields in this file. The computer does not. Therefore, to analyze the data using a computer, a custom software program must be written to provide access to the data.",

            "text": "Extensible markup language (XML) is another widely used format for storing database information. Figure 1(b) shows an example of part of the XML record for the Ebola virus polymerase protein. In this format, each data field can be many lines long; the start and end of a data record contained within a particular field are indicated by tags made of a label between two brackets (\u2018\u2026\u2019). Unlike the lines in the GenBank record in Figure 1(a), a field in an XML record can be placed inside of another, defining a structure and a relationship between them. For example, the TSeq_orgname is placed inside of the TSeq record to show that this organism name applies only to that sequence record. If the file contained multiple sequences, each TSeq field would have its own TSeq_orgname subfield, and the relationship between them would be very clear. This self-describing hierarchical structure makes XML very powerful for expressing many types of data that are hard to express in a single table, such as that used in a spreadsheet. However, in order to find any piece of information in the XML file, a user (with an appropriate search program) needs to traverse the whole file in order to pull out the particular items of data that are of interest. Therefore, while an XML file may be an excellent format for defining and exchanging data, it is often not the best vehicle for efficiently storing and querying that data. That is still the realm of the relational database.",

The format used for storing the data is to divide it into several tables, each of which is equivalent to a single spreadsheet. The relationships between the data in the tables are then defined, and the RDBMS ensures that all data follow the rules laid out by this design. This set of tables and relationships is called the schema. An example diagram of a relational database schema is provided in Figure 2\n. This Viral Genome Database (VGD) schema is an idealized version of a database used to store viral genome sequences, their associated gene sequences, and associated descriptive and analytical information. Each box in Figure 2 represents a single object or concept, such as a genome, gene, or virus, about which we want to store data and is contained in a single table in the RDBMS. The names listed in the box are the columns of that table, which hold the various types of data about the object. The \u2018gene\u2019 table therefore contains columns holding data such as the name of the gene, its coding strand, and a description of its function. The RDBMS is able to enforce a series of rules for tables that are linked by defining relationships that ensure data integrity and accuracy. These relationships are defined by a foreign key in one table that links to corresponding data in another table defined by a primary key. In this example, the RDMS can check that every gene in the \u2018gene\u2019 table refers to an existing genome in the \u2018genome\u2019 table, by ensuring that each of these tables contains a matching \u2018genome_id\u2019. Since any one genome can code for many genes, many genes may contain the same \u2018genome_id\u2019. This defines what is called a one-to-many relationship between the \u2018genome\u2019 and \u2018gene\u2019 tables. All of these relationships are identified in Figure 2 by arrows connecting the tables.",

The \u2018gene_segment\u2019 table specifies the genomic location of the nucleotides that code for each gene. If a gene is coded in the traditional manner \u2013 one ORF, one protein \u2013 then that gene would have one record in the \u2018gene_segment\u2019 table. However, as described above, if a gene is translated from a spliced transcript, it would be represented in the \u2018gene_segment\u2019 table by two or more records, each of which specifies the location of a single exon. If an RNA transcript is edited by stuttering of the polymerase at a particular run of nucleotides, resulting in the addition of one or more non-templated nucleotides, then that gene will also have at least two records in the \u2018gene_segment\u2019 table. In this case, the second \u2018gene_segment\u2019 record may overlap the last base of the first record for that gene. In this manner, an extra, nontemplated base becomes part of the final gene transcript. Other more complex coding schemes can also be identified using this, or similar, database structures.",

Though the database itself does not formally group tables in this manner, database schema diagrams are created to benefit database designers and users by enhancing their ability to understand the structure of the database. These diagrams make it easier to both populate the database with data and query the database for information. The core tables hold basic biological information about each viral strain and its genomic sequence (or sequences if the virus contains segmented genomes) as well as the genes coded for by each genome. The taxonomy tables provide the taxonomic classification of each virus. Taxonomic designations are taken directly from the Eighth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The \u2018gene properties\u2019 tables provide information related to the properties of each gene in the database. Gene properties may be generated from computational analyses such as calculations of molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) that are derived from the amino acid sequence. Gene properties may also be derived from a manual curation process in which an investigator might identify, for example, functional attributes of a sequence based on evidence provided from a literature search. Assignment of \u2018gene ontology\u2019 terms (see below) is another example of information provided during manual curation. The BLAST tables store the results of similarity searches of every gene and genome in the VGD searched against a variety of sequence databases using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST program. Examples of search databases might include the complete GenBank nonredundant protein database and/or a database comprised of all the protein sequences in the VGD itself. While most of us store our BLAST search results as files on our desktop computers, it is useful to store this information within the database to provide rapid access to similarity results for comparative purposes; to use these results to assign genes to orthologous families of related sequences; and to use these results in applications that analyze data in the database and, for example, display the results of an analysis between two or more types of viruses showing shared sets of common genes. Finally, the \u2018admin\u2019 tables provide information on each new data release, an archive of old data records that have been subsequently updated, and a log detailing updates to the database schema itself.",

By annotating the properties of those genes, we are able to see that certain sets of genes showing coordinated regulation are a part of common biological pathways. An important pattern then emerges that was not discernable solely by inspection of the original data. The annotation process consists of a semiautomated analysis of the information content of the data and provides a variety of descriptive features that aid the process of assigning meaning to the data.

It is only through the use of these controlled vocabularies that a consistent, documented approach can be taken during the annotation/curation process. And while there may be instances where creating your own ontology may be necessary, the use of already available, community-developed ontologies ensures that the ontological descriptions assigned to your database will be understood by anyone familiar with the public ontology. Use of these public ontologies also ensures that they support comparative analyses with other available databases that also make use of the same ontological descriptions. The GO Consortium provides one of the most extensive and widely used controlled vocabularies available for biological systems. GO describes biological systems in terms of their biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. The GO effort is community-driven, and any scientist can participate in the development and refinement of the GO vocabulary. Currently, GO contains a number of terms specific to viral processes, but these tend to be oriented toward particular viral families, and may not necessarily be the same terms used by investigators in other areas of virology. Therefore it is important that work continues in the virus community to expand the availability and use of GO terms relevant to all viruses. GO is not intended to cover all things biological. Therefore, other ontologies exist and are actively being developed to support the description of many other biological processes and entities. For example, GO does not describe disease-related processes or mutants; it does not cover protein structure or protein interactions; and it does not cover evolutionary processes. A complementary effort is under way to better organize existing ontologies, and to provide tools and mechanisms to develop and catalog new ontologies. This work is being undertaken by the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies, located at Stanford University, with participants worldwide.",

But while extremely flexible, tabular output is not always the best format to use to fully understand the underlying data and the biological implications. Therefore, many applications that connect to databases provide a variety of visualization tools that display the data graphically, showing patterns in the data that may be difficult to discern using text-based output. An example of one such visual display is provided in Figure 3\nand shows conservation of synteny between the genes of two different poxvirus species. The information used to generate this figure comes directly from the data provided in the VGD. Every gene in the two viruses (in this case crocodilepox virus and molluscum contagiosum virus) has been compared to every other gene using the BLAST search program. The results of this search are stored in the BLAST tables of the VGD. In addition, the location of each gene within its respective genomic sequence is stored in the \u2018gene_segment\u2019 table. This information, once extracted from the database server, is initially text but it is then submitted to a program running on the server that reformats the data and creates a graph. In this manner, it is much easier to visualize the series of points formed along a diagonal when there are a series of similar genes with similar genomic locations present in each of the two viruses. These data sets may contain gene synteny patterns that display deletion, insertion, or recombination events during the course of viral evolution. These patterns can be difficult to detect with text-based tables, but are easy to discern using visual displays of the data.",

As in any other scientific endeavor, the data we generate, the knowledge we derive from the data, and the inferences we make as a result of the analysis of the data are all subject to error. These errors can be introduced at many points in the analytical chain. The original data may be faulty: using sequence data as one example, nucleotides in a DNA sequence may have been misread or miscalled, or someone may even have mistyped the sequence. The database may have been poorly designed; a field in a table designed to hold sequence information may have been set to hold only 2000 characters, whereas the sequences imported into that field may be longer than 2000 nucleotides. The sequences would have then been automatically truncated to 2000 characters, resulting in the loss of data. The curator may have mistyped an Enzyme Commission (EC) number for an RNA polymerase, or may have incorrectly assigned a genomic sequence to the wrong taxonomic classification. Or even more insidious, the curator may have been using annotations provided by other groups that had justified their own annotations on the basis of matches to annotations provided by yet another group. Such chains of evidence may extend far back, and the chance of propagating an early error increases with time. Such error propagation can be widespread indeed, affecting the work of multiple sequencing centers and database creators and providers. This is especially true given the dependencies of genomic sequence annotations on previously published annotations. The possible sources of errors are numerous, and it is the responsibility of both the database provider and the user to be aware of, and on the lookout for, errors. The database provider can, with careful database and application design, apply error-checking routines to many aspects of the data storage and analysis pipeline. The code can check for truncated sequences, interrupted open reading frames, and nonsense data, as well as data annotations that do not match a provided controlled vocabulary. But the user should always approach any database or the output of any application with a little healthy skepticism. The user is the final arbiter of the accuracy of the information, and it is their responsibility to look out for inconsistent or erroneous results that may indicate either a random or systemic error at some point in the process of data collection and analysis.",

Such comparative analyses are greatly aided by having a rigorous classification scheme for the information being studied. The International Union of Microbiological Societies has designated the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as the official body that determines taxonomic classifications for viruses. Through a series of subcommittees and associated study groups, scientists with expertise on each viral species participate in the establishment of new taxonomic groups, assignment of new isolates to existing or newly established taxonomic groups, and reassessment of existing assignments as additional research data become available. The ICTV uses more than 2600 individual characteristics for classification, though sequence homology has gained increasing importance over the years as one of the major classifiers of taxonomic position. Currently, as described in its Eighth Report, the ICTV recognizes 3 orders, 73 families, 287 genera, and 1950 species of viruses. The ICTV officially classifies viral isolates only to the species level. Divisions within species, such as clades, subgroups, strains, isolates, types, etc., are left to others. The ICTV classifications are available in book form as well as from an online database. This database, the ICTVdb, contains the complete taxonomic hierarchy, and assigns each known viral isolate to its appropriate place in that hierarchy. Descriptive information on each viral species is also available. The NCBI also provides a web-based taxonomy browser for access to taxonomically specified sets of sequence records. NCBI's viral taxonomy is not completely congruent with that of ICTV, but efforts have been under way to ensure congruency with the official ICTV classification.",

Because all sequence information submitted to any one of these entities is shared with the others, a researcher need query only one of these sites to get the most up-to-date set of available sequences. GenBank stores all publicly available nucleotide sequences for all organisms, as well as viruses. This includes whole-genome sequences as well as partial-genome and individual coding sequences. Sequences are also available from large-scale sequencing projects, such as those from shotgun sequencing of environmental samples (including viruses), and high-throughput low- and high-coverage genomic sequencing projects. NCBI provides separate database divisions for access to these sequence datasets. The sequence provided in each GenBank record is the distillation of the raw data generated by (in most cases these days) automated sequencing machines. The trace files and base calls provided by the sequencers are then assembled into a collection of contiguous sequences (contigs) until the final sequence has been assembled. In recognition of the fact that there is useful information contained in these trace files and sequence assemblies (especially if one would like to look for possible sequencing errors or polymorphisms), NCBI now provides separate Trace File and Assembly Archives for GenBank sequences when the laboratory responsible for generating the sequence submits these files. Currently, the only viruses represented in these archives are influenza A, chlorella, and a few bacteriophages.",

Furthermore, the annotation associated with the sequence, as provided in the GenBank record, may also contain inaccuracies or be out-of-date. GenBank records are provided and maintained by the group originally submitting the sequence to GenBank. GenBank may review these records for obvious errors and formatting mistakes (such as the lack of an open reading frame where one is indicated), but given the large numbers of sequences being submitted, it is impossible to verify all of the information in these records. In addition, the submitter of a sequence essentially \u2018owns\u2019 that sequence record and is thus responsible for all updates and corrections. NCBI generally will not change any of the information in the GenBank record unless the sequence submitter provides the changes. In some cases, sequence annotations will be updated and expanded, but many, if not most, records never change following their initial submission. (These facts emphasize the responsibility that submitters of sequence data have to ensure the accuracy of their original submission and to update their sequence data and annotations as necessary.) Therefore, the user of the information has the responsibility to ensure, to the extent possible, its accuracy is sufficient to support any conclusions derived from that information. In recognition of these problems, NCBI established the Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database project, which attempts to provide reference sequences for genomes, genes, mRNAs, proteins, and RNA sequences that can be used, in NCBI's words, as \u201ca stable reference for gene characterization, mutation analysis, expression studies, and polymorphism discovery\u201d. RefSeq records are manually curated by NCBI staff, and therefore should provide more current (and hopefully more accurate) sequence annotations to support the needs of the research community. For viruses, RefSeq provides a complete genomic sequence and annotation for one representative isolate of each viral species. NCBI solicits members of the research community to participate as advisors for each viral family represented in RefSeq, in an effort to ensure the accuracy of the RefSeq effort.",

These groups, the National Biomedical Research Foundation at Georgetown University, the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, and the European Bioinformatics Institute, formed a consortium in 2002 to merge each of their individual databases into one comprehensive database, UniProt. UniProt data can be queried by searching for similarity to a query sequence, or by identifying useful records based on the text annotations. Sequences are also grouped into clusters based on sequence similarity.

Nucleotide sequences may be structural, functional, regulatory, or protein coding. Protein sequences may be structural, functional, and/or regulatory, as well. Patterns specified in nucleotide or amino acid sequences can be identified and associated with many of these biological roles. Both general and virus-specific databases exist that map these roles to specific sequence motifs. Most also provide tools that allow investigators to search their own sequences for the presence of particular patterns or motifs characteristic of function. General databases include the NCBI Conserved Domain Database; the Pfam (protein family) database of multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models; and the PROSITE database of protein families and domains. Each of these databases and associated search algorithms differ in how they detect a particular search motif or define a particular protein family. It can therefore be useful to employ multiple databases and search methods when analyzing a new sequence (though in many cases they will each detect a similar set of putative functional motifs). InterPro is a database of protein families, domains, and functional sites that combines many other existing motif databases. InterPro provides a search tool, InterProScan, which is able to utilize several different search algorithms dependent on the database to be searched. It allows users to choose which of the available databases and search tools to use when analyzing their own sequences of interest. A comprehensive report is provided that not only summarizes the results of the search, but also provides a comprehensive annotation derived from similarities to known functional domains. All of the above databases define functional attributes based on similarities in amino acid sequence. These amino acid similarities can be used to classify proteins into functional families. Placing proteins into common functional families is also frequently performed by grouping the proteins into orthologous families based on the overall similarity of their amino acid sequence as determined by pairwise BLAST comparisons. Two virus-specific databases of orthologous gene families are the Viral Clusters of Orthologous Groups database (VOGs) at NCBI, and the Viral Orthologous Clusters database (VOCs) at the Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center and Viral Bioinformatics, Canada.",
