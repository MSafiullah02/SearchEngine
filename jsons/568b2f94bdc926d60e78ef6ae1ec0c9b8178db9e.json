Research also suggests that depression symptoms are more prevalent among internal migrants in China compared to the general population (Qiu et al., 2011) . What is more, internal migrant adolescents report lower levels of self-esteem, higher levels of depression, and have less social connections than local adolescents (Mao and Zhao, 2012) . However, psychological adaptation of migrants may be facilitated by personal resources, such as self-efficacy beliefs (Jerusalem and Mittag, 1995) . Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1997 ) defines self-efficacy as \"belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the course of action required to produce given attainments\"(p. 3). Self-efficacy has been shown to be one of the important factors that help an individual to deal with stressful life transitions and adjust to a new situation (Jerusalem and Mittag, 1995) . Maciejewski, Prigerson, and Mazure (2000) found that self-efficacy mediates the relationship between dependent stressful life events and symptoms of depression among Americans with a prior history of depression. Moving to a new residence (internal migration) was the most often reported life event in the aforementioned study (n = 314), along with serious financial problems (n = 216) and lifethreatening illness or injury (n = 101) (Maciejewski et al., 2000) . Jerusalem and Mittag (1995) suggested that \"within this stressful transitional adaptation to the new societal living conditions, self-efficacy can function as a personal resource protecting against deleterious experiences, negative emotions, and health impairment\" (p. 179).",

Research on young East German migrants suggests that individuals high in self-efficacy perceive changes in their lives more as challenges and less as threats, and report lower anxiety and better health than migrants low in self-efficacy (Jerusalem and Mittag, 1995) . American expatriates in Europe with high levels of selfefficacy express greater degrees of cultural adjustment than those with low levels (Harrison et al., 1996) . Wang and Sangalang (2005) found that among Filipino immigrant employees in Canada self-efficacy is positively related to work adjustment. A study among Afghan and Kurdish refugees in New Zealand and Australia showed that self-efficacy beliefs were associated with higher subjective well-being and lower psychological distress (Sulaiman-Hill and Thompson, 2013) . Selfefficacy was also found to be a predictor of mental health among Malawian returning refugees (Gillespie et al., 2016) . Moreover, research among Somali adolescents resettled in the United States suggests that self-efficacy is positively related to a sense of school belonging and negatively to PTSD and depression symptoms (Kia-Keating and Ellis, 2007) .",

Therefore, the constitution of a new social network is very important for this population. There is one type of self-efficacy beliefs that may especially help migrants to establish new social bonds-social self-efficacy (Sherer et al., 1982) . Although self-efficacy can be defined (Jerusalem and Mittag, 1995) more globally as a \"traitlike general sense of confidence in one's own capabilities to master different types of environmental demands\" (p. 177), it is usually conceptualized as a context-specific construct (Bandura, 1997; Bandura, 2006) . Research suggests that using domain-specific self-efficacy measures allows predicting the outcomes more successfully (Salanova et al., 2002) . Social self-efficacy beliefs can be defined as (Anderson and Betz, 2001 )\"confidence in one's ability to engage in the social interactional tasks necessary to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships in social life and career activities\" (p. 98). Research has shown that social self-efficacy is negatively correlated with attachment anxiety, depression, and loneliness among internal migrants in the USA-freshman college students (Wei et al., 2005 ). In addition, social self-efficacy mediates the relationship between attachment anxiety and loneliness (Wei et al., 2005) . Social self-efficacy is also negatively related to acculturative stress, depression, and self-concealment among international college students in the United States (Constantine et al., 2004) . Fan and Mak (1998) found that first-generation migrant students in Australia reported lower social self-efficacy than second-generation ones. They also reported more social difficulties and fewer shared interests with people in the host society, compared to second-generation migrant students (Fan and Mak, 1998) . International students in Canada also reported lower levels of social self-efficacy than Canadian and second-generation migrant students. Moreover, their low self-efficacy predicted low academic satisfaction and high psychological distress (Leung, 2001a) . Similar results were obtained in Australia-Chinese migrant and overseas students reported lower self-efficacy than Anglo-Australian and secondgeneration migrant students from Southern Europe. Social self-efficacy was also positively related to academic satisfaction and negatively to psychological distress. Overall, the results of the aforementioned study suggest that social relationship issues impact the academic satisfaction of overseas students and migrants to a greater extent than the satisfaction of non-migrant students (Leung, 2001b) . Therefore, it may be concluded that social self-efficacy is potentially beneficial for the psychological adjustment of migrants helping them establish new connections in the social environment. However, most evidence for the positive effects of social self-efficacy is derived from non-experimental research. Our study addresses this gap.",

On the other hand, self-efficacy beliefs in various domains, including initiating and maintaining interpersonal relationships, are malleable and can be intentionally enhanced (Gist and Mitchell, 1992) . In line with Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1997) , selfefficacy beliefs can be altered by interpreting information from four different sources. First, perceived as the most powerful is mastery experience rooted in the interpretation of one's own performance in a specific domain as successful. Second, the vicarious experience is related to observing the accomplishments of others which can be interpreted as a proof of specific goals attainability. Encouraging feedback about one's own skills, abilities or performance given by significant others serve as a third source of self-efficacy beliefs, verbal and social persuasion. Psychological and emotional states are the fourth source. Individuals treat their emotional and physiological reactions like stress or anxiety while performing particular tasks as indicators of their capabilities (Bandura, 1997 ). Bandura's theoretical framework found support in empirical research results (Anderson and Betz, 2001; Usher and Pajares, 2008) . Therefore, we can distinguish not only theoretically but also empirically the aforementioned sources in the context of social self-efficacy beliefs (Anderson and Betz, 2001) .",

Human services professionals exposed to indirect trauma who took part in an Internet-based intervention displayed significantly greater improvements in self-efficacy beliefs related to managing secondary traumatic stress compared to an active control group. The Internetbased sessions included modules focused on recalling past personal successes, the cognitive reappraisal of situations perceived as failures, an individually tailored plan of boosting self-efficacy beliefs and positive thoughts, and emotions reinforcement (Cieslak et al., 2016) . Internet-based interventions are a promising approach to reinforcing the self-efficacy of participants in a variety of specific contexts. Teachers who accomplished an Internet-based problem-solving training displayed significantly greater improvements in general and work-specific self-efficacy compared to waitlist control group members (Ebert et al., 2014 ). An online positive psychology intervention to promote positive emotions, self-efficacy, and engagement at work consisting of modules targeting happiness, goal setting, and resource building, has shown its positive impact on participants' self-efficacy (Ouweneel et al., 2011) . The web-based intervention aimed at promoting healthy eating has proven its effectiveness in enhancing self-efficacy for total dairy intake among college students (Poddar et al., 2010) . Moreover, the Internetbased program aimed at reducing cannabis use has shown a positive effect on participants' use-related self-efficacy (Tossmann et al., 2011) . To sum up, empirical evidence suggests that self-efficacy beliefs are malleable and can be effectively enhanced using Internet-based interventions (Cieslak et al., 2016; Ebert et al., 2014; Poddar et al., 2010; Tossmann et al., 2011) . The aim of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed self-help Internet-based intervention, New in Town, in enhancing social self-efficacy when compared to a waiting-list control group. Whereas Internet-based interventions aimed at self-efficacy reinforcement have been investigated in the various aforementioned contexts, New in Town may be the first one targeting internal migrants. According to the National Census of Population and Housing 2011 in Poland, 38,9% of Polish citizens are migrants-they had lived elsewhere before for at least one year. In the years 2002-2011 most of them (95,6%) were internal migrants. Only 4,4% of Polish migrants had lived abroad before moving to the current place of residence (Statistics Poland, 2012) .",

Interpersonal interactions pose the risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic (WHO, n.d.) . Therefore, following the recommendations of the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Psychology at the SWPS University of Social Sciences (16th March 2020) the recruitment is suspended until 1st September 2020, with the possibility of extension. The anticipated date of recruitment completion is 14th December 2020. Applicants will be directed to the study website where they will be informed of the study design and asked to complete online screening questionnaires about demographic data and their Internet access. Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) being at least 18 years old, (2) having changed the place of residence in the last 6 months. Targeted sample is prone to adjustment disorders development. In line with DSM-V, adjustment disorder became chronic when the symptoms persist more than six months from the moment when the trigger has occurred (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). As the New in Town intervention is focused on soft skills development related to social self-efficacy it cannot be treated as professional help for those individuals who faced clinical symptoms of chronic adjustment disorder. Therefore, we have chosen the criterion of 6 months. When explaining participants this criterion we use internal migration definition of Statistics Poland-\"change of place of residence (\u2026) in the territory of Poland, related to crossing the administrative border of a gmina (Polish administrative unit), including-in case of urban-rural gminas-changes of the place of residence within a gmina, i.e. from rural to urban areas and vice versa\" (Statistics Poland, 2020) . The exclusion criterion is the lack of Internet access. Applicants who meet inclusion criteria will be automatically directed to electronic informed consent to enroll in the study. All study participants will be informed of their right to delist from the study without any consequences. After giving consent, participants will be asked to complete baseline questionnaires. ",

Participants assigned to the New in Town group will be provided with login details as soon as possible. The waiting-list group will be given login instruction 8 weeks after baseline. Both groups receive access to the intervention for a period of 3 weeks. In order to log in to the intervention website, all participants will get a unique password. After logging for the first time each participant is automatically asked to create own password. The participants can change the password to an account any time they wish. The post-test assessment is scheduled at 3 weeks after baseline, follow-up assessment at 8 weeks after baseline. All assessments (baseline, post-test, and follow-up) are self-reports and will be conducted online. Research has confirmed the reliability and validity of the Internet administration format of self-report psychological questionnaires (Hedman et al., 2010) . Participants will be informed via email to complete assessments and will receive links to online questionnaires. Two email reminders will be sent if the questionnaires stay incomplete for one week. Fig. 1 provides the study flow chart, while the schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments (SPIRIT figure) is presented in Fig. 2. ",

The remaining test items (7) are buffer theorems. The respondents give answers on a scale 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). In the trial, we will use one subscale, which measures beliefs about self-efficacy in establishing and maintaining relationships with others. Social self-efficacy will be indicated by the total sum of 6 items scores, e.g. \"I have acquired my friends through my personal abilities at making friends\". Higher scores reflect a higher level of self-efficacy. The scale demonstrates good psychometric properties (Sherer et al., 1982) . A. Rogala, et al. Internet Interventions 21 (2020) 100322 2.10.2.

Each item is measured using on 5-point Likert scale (1 = definitely yes, 5 = definitely no), e.g. \"I often feel rejected\". Positive items should be reversed. The sum of scores is counted on 2 separate subscales: emotional and social loneliness. The scale can be applied in different data collection modes; in face-to-face interviews as well as in online questionnaires.

Evidence also suggests that self-efficacy is malleable and can be effectively reinforced using Internet-based interventions (Cieslak et al., 2016; Ebert et al., 2014; Poddar et al., 2010; Tossmann et al., 2011) . Because the number of migrants is steadily increasing over the past years (United Nations, 2017) and more than 30% of Polish citizens are internal migrants (Statistics Poland, 2012) , the current challenge is to develop an effective and easily accessible intervention targeting this population. With our study, we hope to gain insight into the efficacy and acceptance of the New in Town-self-help Internet-based intervention aimed at increasing social self-efficacy among internal migrants in Poland. The study is a randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control group. The primary outcome is social self-efficacy.

            "text": "The study is not free from limitations. Firstly, the online platform does not collect the data of the way participants will use the intervention (duration and frequency of being logged in to it). It is crucial to explore participants' patterns of accomplishing modules and identify the most crucial modules. Each intervention module is activated one by one, but participants have always the possibility to return to previous ones. Dates of module activation are not set in advance. Therefore, the chance that some participants might complete the whole intervention at once still exists. On the other hand, open access to non-blocked modules allows participants to use the intervention at own pace and to adapt exercise completion to the daily life duties. At the post-test, we plan to collect user experience data that might be helpful in enhancing the intervention. Secondly, the New in Town and assessments were not A. Rogala, et al. Internet Interventions 21 (2020) 100322 provided on the same platform. This inconvenience may have an impact on drop-out rates. Relatively high dropout rates are found in a number of Internet-based interventions studies (Christensen et al., 2009; Melville et al., 2010) . Therefore, we plan to adjust for missing data using the GEE approach (Hubbard et al., 2010) . The other concern is recruitment. Participants will be recruited via social and traditional media campaigns. It will be a self-selected sample that might be highly motivated for Internet-based interventions. This fact could affect the outcomes and become the main concern that should not be ignored without considering further research directions. For this reason, we plan in the near future to transfer the intervention to a more traditional medium and conduct it in the form of workshops or e-learning courses dedicated to freshman college students and assess its efficacy as well. Moreover, the control group in our study is a waitlist control. Research has shown that using this type of control condition may lead to bigger treatment effect sizes estimates compared to no treatment and psychological placebo (Furukawa et al., 2014) . However, the aforementioned research was on CBT for depression and therefore generalizability of this evidence may be limited. Additionally, one of the inclusion criteria is having changed the place of residence in the last 6 months. Therefore, participants in a waitlist control group can wait longer to access the intervention than they were between changing the place of residence and study enrollment. Because of that study could yield more conservative results. Future studies should focus on comparing the New in Town with a different intervention as an active control condition.",

Exercises in the intervention are based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to four sources of self-efficacy beliefs. According to Social Cognitive Theory, these beliefs can be enhanced by interpreting information from mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and physiological states (Bandura, 1997) . Secondly, we will use well-validated measures of primary and secondary outcomes. The strong aspect of the study design is also using two follow-up measurement points that enable us to track long-term effects. Finally, the New in Town is designed specifically for migrants, who are potentially at greater risk of difficulties in the social area (Kirmayer et al., 2011; Zheng and Berry, 1991) .",
