There has no definite and strict diagnostic criteria for bronchitis, the main signs are cough, expectoration. Bronchitis is not associated with constitutional symptoms and other signs such as tachypnea, hypoxemia, and so on. Auscultatory findings of bronchitis consist of coarse crackles, medium crackles, and slight wheezes. The definition of disease severity was based on strategy to enhance influenza surveillance worldwide [Ortiz et al., 2009] . For children >5 years old, all of the following four items must be required: (i) Sudden onset of fever >38\u02daC, (ii) Cough or sore throat, (iii) Shortness of breath (breathing faster than 25 breaths/min) or difficult breathing, (iv) Requires hospitalization.

This study found that 94.57% patient samples had at least one detectable potential viral pathogen; this detection rate was significantly higher than previous studies (48.1-90%) that used traditional PCR or direct immunofluorescence Ahmed et al., 2012; Bicer et al., 2013; Bukhari and Elhazmi 2013] and was higher than a German study that used real-time PCR (detecting 14 viruses with a result of 78% positive) [Franz et al., 2010] . It is possible that the detection rate in this study could be due to the increased sensitivity of real-time PCR compared to conventional PCR and viral culture methods. This study also detected 14 different viruses, the viral pathogen spectrum was more comprehensive than many previous studies (7-12 viruses) Ahmed et al., 2012; Bicer et al., 2013; Bukhari and Elhazmi, 2013] . Additionally patients in this study all were diagnosed with ALRTI, and in many instances, the patients were suffering from severe disease. Meerhoff et al. [2010] indicated that using NPA resulted in a higher detection rate than using a nasal swab as a sample, it is possible that the use of NPA might also be associated with the higher rate of detection seen in this study. Finally, other factors such as race and geographical conditions may have some influence on the viral burden in the population, and thus the detection rate. RSV was detected in 52.79% of the children and it was the most common virus among the 14 viruses detected as part of this study. The detection rate was similar to that reported by Franz et al. [2010] who also used a real-time PCR approach. Only 12.14% of children were found HMPV positive, although this detection rate was higher than other studies that used the same detection method such as in Italy (2.9%), Germany (less than 9%), and the United States (9%) [Bosis et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2008; Franz et al., 2010] . Similar to other studies [Franz et al., 2010; Singleton et al., 2010; Bicer et al., 2013; Bukhari and Elhazmi, 2013] , RSV was the most common virus in children with ALRTI [Franz et al., 2010; Singleton et al., 2010; Bicer et al., 2013; Bukhari and Elhazmi, 2013] . RSV and HMPV were associated with more severe illness . It is apparent that RSV and HMPV play an important role in children with ALRTI in different regions globally.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that cold exposure may increase the possibility of bronchoconstriction, airway congestion, secretion, and decrease innate immune mechanisms such as mucocialiary clearance [Giesbrecht, 1995] . This indicates that cold seasons may increase the risk of respiratory infections. In this study, RSV showed a clear seasonal distribution in winter-spring. In contrast, the maximum prevalence was observed in March to August in Singapore and Brazil, but in September to November in Malaysia which also located in tropical zone [Chew et al., 1998; Pecchini et al., 2008; Khor et al., 2012] . There was no significant seasonality of HMPV observed in this study, but in studies performed in Korea and Turkey, the peak season was winterspring [Kim et al., 2010; Bicer et al., 2013] . These observations suggest that not all respiratory virus infection is common in cold seasons. The seasonality of viruses was different in different regions; this may correlate with local geographical and climatic features.",

            "text": "Pathogens associated with respiratory tract infections can be very complex and there is no specific symptom to distinguish one infection from another. Research about the viral etiology of bronchiolitis among children in northern Taiwan indicated that RSV and HMPV were the main virus for children with bronchiolitis, with RSV observed as the most common cause [Chen et al., 2012] . In this study, bronchiolitis patients were most likely to result in the identification of a potential viral pathogen among the three diagnoses; bronchiolitis was most often associated with RSV and HMPV positive patients. The main symptoms in RSV and HMPV positive patients were cough, wheezing, and fever. Scagnolari et al. [2012] indicated that RSV viral load was positively associated with the clinical severity of bronchiolitis hospitalization. Fodha et al. [2007] also found that nasopharyngeal RSV loads were higher in patients with severe disease. In contrast, clinical aspects observed in patients with serious LRTIs, like respiratory rate, cyanosis, and hospitalization were not associated with high viral loads. We also analyzed the relationship between severity and viral load using multiple linear regression, the viral load showed no apparent significant difference between severe and not severe disease groups in this study. These findings are in agreement with previous studies indicating that RSV viral load may have no correlation with the disease severity [Wright et al., 2002; Jansen et al., 2010] . However, in this study, RSV viral load was significantly different between three diagnostic groups and a high RSV viral load may be a risk factor of developing bronchiolitis. Excluding severity and underlying diseases, Children aged <1 year had a higher viral load than other children. It is possible that this is due to the children aged <1 year having an immature immune system resulting in an inappropriate shift toward a Th2 immune response to RSV infection [Gerna et al., 2008] . In our study, days of illness <14 days had a higher viral load compared with !14 days for RSV, this was because the long days of illness may associated with co-infecting, this also consistent with the result in our study that children positive for RSV alone had a higher viral load than co-infected with other viruses.",

However, this is consistent with the overall higher detection rate in observed this study as mentioned above. In this study, children infected with RSV alone had a higher viral load than in RSV patients co-infected with other viruses; this observation was not seen with HMPV and reflects in part an observation made by Franz et al. [2010] . Martin et al. [2012] showed that the correlation between viral load and viral co-infection was virus specific and in their study, both RSV and HMPV were present at consistently high viral loads regardless of whether the patient was co-infected with another virus. The effect of co-infection on disease RSV or HMPV disease severity remains unclear and controversial. Semple et al. [2005] found dual infection by HMPV and RSV was associated with severe bronchiolitis, while other studies have found no association of co-infection with disease severity [Peng et al., 2009] or co-infection was correlated with less severe disease [Martin et al., 2012] . In our study, the incidence of severe disease was similar between single infections and co-infections, indicating that co-infection was not associated with more severe disease. An immune response to the first virus infection might alter the disease severity of a subsequently virus by the induction of interferon and other anti-viral response modifiers [Martin et al., 2012] . The impact of these immunomodulators could be to restrain colonization and pathogenicity of the co-infecting virus. However, more research is needed to determine what the relationship between co-infecting viruses and disease development is.",
