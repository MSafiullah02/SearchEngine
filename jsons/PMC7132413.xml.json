SARS-CoV is phylogenetically diverged from other known coronaviruses associated with human infections including human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but closely related to the civet and the bat SARS-CoVs, a group of lineage B betacoronaviruses found in civets, raccoon dogs, ferret badgers and Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) in Guangdong Province of South China (Chan et al., 2013c) The Chinese horseshoe bat appears to be the natural reservoir of the ancestral SARS-CoV, because the Ka/Ks ratios (rate of nonsynonymous mutation/rate of synonymous mutation) of the S, orf3a, and nsp3 genes were low, while those of the civet strains in both the 2003 and the minor 2004 outbreaks were high, suggesting a rapidly evolving process of gene adaptation in the animals (Lau et al., 2005b, Li et al., 2005a).",

The initial cases were animal handlers in Guangzhou Province having regular contact with wild game food animals, suggesting that civets could serve as an intermediate amplification host, and later the patients\u2019 close household and hospital contacts. The human SARS-CoV subsequently evolved and was capable of person-to-person transmission. The epidemic was rapidly and globally disseminated when a medical professor from a teaching hospital in Guangzhou, who was considered as a \u201csuper-spreader\u201d of SARS, came to Hong Kong on 21 February 2003. During his stay in hotel M, he transmitted the infection to other residents, and the secondary cases spread the disease to hospitals in Hong Kong, and to other countries including Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada. Eventually, a total of 8096 patients were infected in over 30 countries among 5 continents and 774 (9.5%) of them died (Cheng et al., 2007a).",

Since the clinical efficacy of these antiviral agents were found to be uncertain in retrospective analysis (Leong et al., 2004), effective public health and infection control measures including contact tracing and quarantine of close contacts played an important role in preventing further transmission of SARS in the communities and hospitals (Pang et al., 2003, Svoboda et al., 2004).",

Since the etiological agent of SARS was unknown during the initial phase of the epidemic, patients were given empirical antibiotics for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, with coverage of both typical and atypical bacterial pathogens (So et al., 2003). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were indicated in patients who developed nosocomial bacteremia, catheter-related sepsis, and nosocomial pneumonia due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Peiris et al., 2003a). Effective antiviral agents are needed to control viral replication, and hence inflammation and tissue damage, as the high viral load was positively correlated with the development of organ failure and death in a subsequent study (Hung et al., 2009). Before the identification of SARS-CoV as the etiological agent of SARS, the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir was also prescribed to some patients in Toronto and Singapore which obviously was unlikely to affect the prognosis (Booth et al., 2003, Hsu et al., 2003, Poutanen et al., 2003).",

Moreover, ribavirin was shown to be synergistic with interferon in in vitro combination assays (Chen et al., 2004). The low level of in vitro activity against SARS-CoV might be attributed to cellular toxicity, as the 50% cytotoxic dose of ribavirin on various cell lines has been reported to be approximately 200\u20131000 \u03bcg/mL (Tan et al., 2004). Adverse effects of ribavirin were not uncommon. In a cohort of 110 patients in Toronto, dose-related hemolytic anemia was observed in 61% of patients, whereas hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia was reported in 58% and 46% respectively (Knowles et al., 2003). In another cohort of 44 patients in Taiwan, 73% of patients had a drop in hemoglobin level 3 days after therapy with ribavirin which was found to be an independent prognostic factor of hypoxemia or mortality (Chiou et al., 2005).",

In vitro antiviral susceptibility testing showed that the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV was inhibited by lopinavir at 4 \u03bcg/ml and ribavirin at 50 \u03bcg/ml after 48 h of incubation. Inhibition of the cytopathic effect was achieved down to a lopinavir concentration 1 \u03bcg/ml combined with ribavirin 6.25 \u03bcg/ml, only when the viral inoculum was reduced to 50 TCID50 or below, suggesting potential synergistic activity (Chu et al., 2004a). The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a reduction in the overall death rate (2.3%) and intubation rate (0%), when compared with a matched cohort who received standard treatment with ribavirin (15.6% and 11.0% respectively, P\n < 0.05). However, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy showed no difference in the overall death rate or in rates of oxygen desaturation and intubation, compared with the matched cohort in subgroup analysis (Chan et al., 2003). In view of the weak antiviral activity of protease inhibitors, further studies should be done to ascertain whether the clinical benefit could be attributed to their anti-apoptotic rather than their antiviral activity (Matarrese et al., 2003).",

In addition, the combination of corticosteroid and interferon alfacon-1 appeared to result in improvements in oxygenation requirement and faster resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities (Loutfy et al., 2003). However, in vitro susceptibility testing of interferons against SARS-CoV showed inconsistent results for interferon-\u00df1a and interferon-\u03b12b (Cinatl et al., 2003, Hensley et al., 2004, Stroher et al., 2004), although inhibition of cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV in culture was observed for interferon-\u00df, interferon-\u03b1n1, interferon-\u03b1n3, and leukocytic interferon-\u03b1 (Tan et al., 2004). Treatment with both interferon-\u00df and interferon-\u03b3 synergistically inhibited SARS-CoV plaque formation by 30-fold and replication by 3000-fold at 24 h, and by more than 105-fold at 48 and 72 h post-infection in Vero E6 cells (Sainz et al., 2004). Prophylactic treatment of SARS-CoV-infected macaques with pegylated interferon-alpha reduced viral replication and excretion, and viral antigen expression by type 1 pneumocytes (Haagmans et al., 2004).",

Various regimens of corticosteroid therapy were used (Sung et al., 2004, Tsang et al., 2003a), but a standard treatment protocol for adult SARS patients, comprising a tailing dose of intravenous methylprednisolone from 1 mg/kg every 8 h to oral prednisolone 0.25 mg/kg throughout a course of 21 days was proposed (So et al., 2003). A retrospective analysis of 72 SARS patients showed that among 17 patients who initially received a pulse dose of methylprednisolone of \u2a7e500 mg/day had a lower oxygen requirement and better radiographic outcome, when compared with another 55 patients who initially received non-pulse doses of methylprednisolone of <500 mg/day, even though the cumulative steroid dosage, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, mortality rates, hematologic and biochemical parameters were similar in both groups after 21 days (Ho et al., 2003b). In a retrospective analysis in Guangzhou, corticosteroid treatment was shown to lower the overall mortality and shorten hospitalization stay in the critically ill SARS patients (Chen et al., 2006).",

The number of osteonecrotic lesions was directly related to the dosage of corticosteroid, and a peak dose of more than 200 mg or a cumulative methylprednisolone- equivalent dose of more than 4000 mg were significant risk factors for multifocal osteonecrosis, with both epiphyseal and diaphyseal lesions (Zhang et al., 2008).

In view of the super-spreading phenomenon from an index patient in Hong Kong leading to the global dissemination of SARS, airborne transmission of SARS-CoV was considered possible under special circumstances (Chu et al., 2005a, Roy and Milton, 2004). Numerous studies were done to identify potential risk factors for transmission in community and hospital settings (Table 3A, Table 3B, Table 3C\n). In a case-control study conducted in Beijing to investigate the risk factors for community transmission among persons without known contact with SARS patients, it was found that consistent wearing of a mask outdoors was associated with a 70% risk reduction, compared to not wearing a mask, while consistently washing hands after returning home showed a smaller risk reduction (Wu et al., 2004a). These findings suggest that basic infection control measures with good hand hygiene practice can reduce the risk of community transmission.",

The risk of developing SARS was 12.6 times higher for those who did not wear a mask during patient care (Nishiyama et al., 2008). Because of the physical stability of SARS-CoV, it can survive for 4 days in diarrheal stool samples with an alkaline pH, and it can remain infectious in respiratory specimens for over 7 days at room temperature (Lai et al., 2005b). Contact with respiratory secretions was a significant risk factor for SARS transmission (Teleman et al., 2004). Exposure to body fluids of healthcare workers\u2019 eyes and mucous membranes was also associated with an increased risk of transmission (Raboud et al., 2010).

It was also interesting to note that the relative risk may be higher for nurses than physicians. This might be explained by the longer duration of exposure that nurses likely had in the peri-intubation period, whereas physician exposure was often limited to the procedure itself (Fowler et al., 2004). In fact, proximity and duration of contact with SARS patients may be associated with a higher risk of viral transmission. Transmission of SARS also occurred in 3 of 5 persons present during the endotracheal intubation, including one who wore gloves, gown, and an N95 respirator (Scales et al., 2003).",

The infection rate of SARS among healthcare workers also correlated with the ratios of the area of the ventilation windows to the area of the room. The greatest transmission was in the ward with the smallest area of 61.9 m2 and no window, resulting in 52 (73%) of healthcare workers becoming infected after caring for one SARS patient.

A super-spreading phenomenon was described in the earliest nosocomial outbreak in Guangzhou, in which an index patient directly or indirectly transmitted the infection to over 80 healthcare workers within 2 days of hospitalization (Wu et al., 2004b). A delay in recognition of symptomatic patients and inappropriate infection control measures were the most important reasons for nosocomial outbreaks.

Because the mode of transmission was not fully understood in the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, infection control measures varied from center to center, depending on the availability of resources and administrative support. In a private hospital with less than 60 beds in Hanoi, Vietnam, SARS patients were cohorted with the use of barrier precautions. N95 respirators, goggles, and face shields were not available until 6 days after the outbreak (Reynolds et al., 2006). In contrast, in a tertiary hospital with 1400 beds in Singapore, N95 respirators, gloves, gowns, and goggles were immediately provided to healthcare workers working in emergency room, intensive care unit, and isolation ward, whereas powered air purified respirators were available for high-risk procedures such as intubation (Gopalakrishna et al., 2004). In a community hospital in Toronto, in addition to droplet and contact precautions and caring for SARS patients in airborne infection isolation ward, healthcare workers wore double gloves, double gowns, goggles, cap and shoe covers workers in the isolation ward, intensive care unit and emergency room (Dwosh et al., 2003). In Kaohsiung, Taiwan, construction of standard negative-pressure isolation rooms was expedited, and the emergency room was moved outside the hospital complex for patient triage (Liu et al., 2006). In a hospital in Hong Kong, when the demand for personal protective equipment was high in the outbreak setting, their provision to healthcare workers was stratified according to the risk of exposure to SARS patients (Ho et al., 2003a).",

Using a computational fluid dynamic simulation test in a retrospective analysis, it was found that the air exchange related to the small temperature differences between cubicles might have contributed to SARS transmission (Chen et al., 2011).",

Early isolation of suspected patients is important to prevent nosocomial transmission (Chowell et al., 2003). In Hong Kong, patients triaged at the emergency department and transferred from other hospitals were evaluated using a set of clinical and epidemiological criteria, such as fever over 38 \u00b0C, cough, or shortness of breath, and with history of close contact to SARS case. Patients fulfilling those criteria were admitted to designated wards, where the number of beds in each cubicle was reduced to allow a bed-to-bed distance of at least 2 meters, so as to minimize the risk of transmission (Ho et al., 2003c). A dedicated team of physicians and nurses, led by experienced respiratory and infectious disease experts, was established to provide special care to all patients admitted to the designated wards. Active surveillance of patients with community or nosocomial acquired pneumonia was also conducted in general wards to identify and isolate any unrecognized cases. Standard, contact, and droplet precautions were enforced in all clinical areas in the hospital.",
