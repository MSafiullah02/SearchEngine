We have developed a CRISPR-based assay that can meet all 27 these criteria. This assay utilizes a custom CRISPR Cas12a/gRNA complex and a fluorescent 28 probe to amplify target amplicons produced by standard RT-PCR or isothermal recombinase 29 polymerase amplification (RPA), to allow sensitive detection at sites not equipped with real-time 30 PCR systems required for qPCR diagnostics. We found this approach allowed sensitive and 31 robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, with a sample-to-answer time of ~ 50 min, 32 and a limit of detection of 2 copies per sample. CRISPR assay diagnostic results obtained nasal 33 swab samples of individuals with suspected COVID-19 cases were comparable to paired results 34 from a CDC-approved qPCR assay performed in a state testing lab, and superior to those 35 produced by same assay in a clinical lab, where the qPCR assay exhibited multiple invalid or 36 inconclusive results. Our assay also demonstrated greater analytical sensitivity and more robust 37 diagnostic performance than other recently reported CRISPR-based assays. Based on these 38 findings, we believe that a CRISPR-based fluorescent application has potential to improve 39 current COVID-19 screening efforts. 40",

However, disease control efforts are hindered by multiple 48 factors, including difficulty in rapidly producing the number diagnostic tests required for such 49 efforts, the apparent limited diagnostic sensitivity of current tests, and the technical expertise 50 required to obtain valid results with them. Large scale testing appears to be essential since 51 estimates indicate that large numbers of mild, asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic COVID-19 52 cases are not detected by current testing efforts (Kobayashi et al. 2020 In this work, we describe a rapid and accurate RT-PCR CRISPR-Cas12a fluorescent reporter 103 assay that demonstrates comparable diagnostic performance to a CDC-approved test performed 104 in a state testing lab, without inconclusive or invalid results that observed when the same 105 QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany).

One-step reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain 172 reaction (RT-PCR) or recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) methods are used to 173 amplify viral cDNA target regions from RNA extracted from nasal swabs, and the resulting 174 amplicons are transferred in their entirety to the gRNA/Cas12a-based CRISPR system for 175 fluorescence detection. Recognition of the target amplicon by the gRNA/Cas12a complex, which 176 is regulated by a target-specific synthetic gRNA, induces the gRNA/Cas12a complex to 177 specifically cleaves the target amplicon and non-specifically cleave a reporter oligo modified 178 with fluorescein and a quencher molecule at each terminus to produce a fluorescent signal. equipment available in most clinical laboratories, can be readily automated to meet a demand for high-throughput testing, and has the potential for use in point-of-care settings if assay results are 182 analyzed with a portable fluorescence reader.183 3.2 Target Mapping and Primer Design 184 Numerous assays have now been developed to detect SARS-CoV-2, most of which employ 185 strategies to that amplify species-specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, including 186 sites in the viral nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E) genes, and open reading frame 1ab 187 (ORF1ab). The assay developed by the Chinese CDC targets sites with ORF1ab and the N gene, 188 while a test from the US CDC targets a site within the N gene, and one developed by the World 189 Health Organization targets a regions within the E gene, each of which contains a potential 190 CRISPR recognition site (Figure 1B). To permit direct comparison of the results from our 191 proposed CRISPR-FDS approach with those from an establish test in clinical use, we designed 192 primers and gRNAs (Table S1) to target the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and N regions analyzed by 193 the Chinese CDC assay (Figure 1B). Bioinformatic analysis of these primers and gRNAs against 194 common respiratory flora and other viral pathogens revealed that these sequences exhibited 195 strong specificity for the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table S2). Sequence alignment of these 196 SARS-CoV-2 target regions with corresponding sites in related beta coronaviruses that cause 197 middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome 198 (SARS-CoV), and human coronavirus (Human-CoV) OC43/HKU1/229E/NL63, detected 199 variable amounts of sequence variation between these species (Figure 1C). The target region 200 with the N gene exhibited the greatest degree of variation in this analysis, with multiple 201 nucleotide differences detected along the aligned sequences. More differences were detected 202 between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV in this region, in agreement with their gene primer, while differed at three of four positions of the gRNA protospacer adjacent motif 205 (PAM) required for CAS12a cleavage activity. The SARS-CoV ORF1ab region differed from 206 the matching gRNA at a single position outside its PAM, but both primer regions used to 207 produce the target for this gRNA exhibited at least nucleotide variant, decreasing the likelihood 208 for false positive SARS-CoV recognition events. Analysis of RT-PCR-amplified and 209 RT-RPA-amplified ORF1ab target sequence from a SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive control sample 210 demonstrated that both approaches produced strong signal relative to the background present in 211 their matching negative control samples (Figure 1D), and this difference was observed for both 212 assay targets (Figure 1E), and signal detected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV samples did not 213 differ from negative control signal (",

In the U.S., one estimate 53 suggest that only 1.6% of COVID-19 cases have been detected(Vollmer.  2020), while another 54 study estimates that about 17.9% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic at 55 their first positive test and may not develop symptoms for up to two weeks (Mizumoto et al. 56 2020). These are alarming statistics, since one estimate suggests that an infected individual may 57 infect 5.6 additional people on average (Steven et al. 2020), and that individuals with 58 asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may be as infectious as those with 59 employed a CRISPR-Cas12a approach (DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter; DETECTR) to distinguish clinical specimens containing human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) and 91 HPV18, correctly identifying of 25/25 and 23/25 samples, respectively (Chen et al. 2018).
