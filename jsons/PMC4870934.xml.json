Human beings are occasional hosts for ticks and are usually viewed as dead-end hosts that have no role in maintaining tick-borne agents in nature.2 Different tick species favour distinct biotopes or environments, which define their geographical distribution and, consequently, the areas of risk for human tick-borne infections. In the past three decades, tick-borne pathogens have emerged worldwide and become a great threat to human health.1, 3\n",

Although an increasing number of tick-borne infections have been reported in mainland China, no comprehensive review of this substantial public health problem has been undertaken. We will provide an overview of the type and distribution of emerging tick-borne infections in tick vectors, animal hosts, and human beings. We will describe the clinical characteristics of human tick-borne diseases, and discuss possible factors contributing to their emergence.",

The other nine human pathogens were initially detected in ticks or animals and subsequently shown to infect human beings (Rickettsia heilongjiangiensis, Rickettsia sibirica sp BJ-90, Rickettsia raoultii, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma capra, Borrelia valaisiana-related genospecies, Babesia microti, and Babesia divergens). Among these 15 emerging tick-borne diseases, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was first identified in mainland China34 and subsequently reported in South Korea and Japan.134, 135 A disease similar to SFTS has been reported in the USA.136 Human infections with R sibirica sp BJ-90, Candidatus R tarasevichiae, A capra, and B valaisiana-related genospecies have been exclusively diagnosed in mainland China.11, 17, 46, 78 Human infections of Candidatus N mikurensis, Ba venatorum, and R raoultii, which have been detected in China, were first identified in Europe.18, 33, 48 Five tick-borne pathogens have been detected in ticks or reservoir hosts, or both, but have not yet been reported to cause infection in human beings in China. They include Rickettsia monacensis, Rickettsia slovaca, Rickettsia sibirica sp mongolotimonae, B valaisiana, and B burgdorferi sensu stricto.137, 138, 139, 140, 141 Additionally, a Rickettsia species (Candidatus Rickettsia hebeiii), two Ehrlichia species (Ehrlichia canis and Ehrlichia sp Tibet), an Anaplasma species (Anaplasma platys), a genospecies of B burgdorferi sensu lato (Borrelia sinica), and eight Babesia species (Babesia ovis, Babesia ovata, Babesia orientalis, Babesia major, Babesia motasi, Babesia caballi, Babesia sp Kashi, and Babesia sp Xinjiang) have been identified in ticks or animals, but their pathogenicity to human beings is unknown.",

Of 34 people infected with R heilongjiangiensis, 19 were diagnosed in forested areas of northeastern China in the 1990s.35, 45 The other 15 cases of infection were reported on the island of Hainan Province in 2008.43 In 2012, we undertook an active surveillance for human SFGR infections at the Mudanjiang Forestry Central Hospital of Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China, and eight cases of SFGR infection (including five infected by Candidatus R tarasevichiae, one by R sibirica sp BJ-90, and two by R raoultii) were identified by molecular detection and sequence determination. The presence of antibody against SFGR antigen in serum samples detected by immunofluorescence assay lent support to the diagnosis of SFGR.46, 48 Additionally, 37 patients were reported to have been infected with uncharacterised species of SFGR, including one in Inner Mongolia, one in Xinjiang Autonomous Region, 29 in Hainan Province, and six in Heilongjiang Province (figure 2).119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124 The clinical manifestations of SFGR infections mainly include fever, eschar, headache, malaise, asthenia, anorexia, nausea, and lymphadenopathy. A few patients had rash and neurological manifestations such as coma, neck stiffness, and Kernig's sign.11, 35, 43, 45, 46, 48, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124 Detailed information about the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients infected with each of the emerging SFGR species are summarised in the appendix.",

Additionally, A phagocytophilum infects domestic and wild animals, including cattle, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, hare, yaks, and 24 species of rodents (appendix).36, 51, 54, 55, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72\nA capra was first recognised in goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) and provisionally named by our group, but has since been detected in I persulcatus ticks in Heilongjiang Province.17 Although Candidatus N mikurensis was initially identified in I persulcatus and Haemaphysalis concinna ticks,18 it was subsequently detected in D silvarum, H longicornis, and various rodents from many areas of mainland China.18, 76, 77 Three other species, including E canis, Ehrlichia sp Tibet, and A platys, have not been proven to infect human beings. Data regarding infected ticks and animal hosts are shown in figure 1 and the appendix.13, 14, 16, 57, 63\n",

Two cases of Ba divergens infection were detected from 377 patients with anaemia in Shandong Province in 2009.108 A case of babesiosis caused by Ba venatorum was reported in a child from Xinjiang Autonomous Region.33 Between 2011 and 2014, 48 cases of Ba venatorum infection were reported through our active surveillance at a sentinel hospital in forested areas of northeastern China. Among them, 32 were confirmed cases, and 16 were probable cases.109 These infections were the first report of endemic human Ba venatorum disease anywhere in the world. Additionally, two cases of babesiosis caused by uncharacterised Babesia species were reported in Yunnan Province of southwestern China in 1982 and one in 2008 (figure 2).132, 133 Clinical manifestations for patients with Babesia species infections included fever, fatigue, anaemia, chills, and high levels of hepatic aminopherase and C-reactive protein.33, 108, 104, 109, 107, 132, 133 Detailed information about the clinical manifestations of each of these species of Babesia infections is summarised in the appendix.",

Reforestation of this region during the 20th century is thought to have increased the population of white-tailed deer, which greatly amplified the number of Ixodes scapularis. Consequentially, vector tick densities grew and expanded, contributing substantially to the emergence of Lyme disease in the USA.159 Fragmentation of forests in eastern regions of Canada and the USA might have increased the relative abundance of small mammals because of a reduction in predator communities, leading to an increase in B burgdorferi sensu lato infection rates in I scapularis nymphs.

One example described in our study was in the most severely endemic region of SFTS. Our findings showed that the incidence of SFTS is significantly associated with vegetation-rich lands.

This rapid urbanisation, followed by widespread rural-to-urban migration of the human population, intensive long-distance trade, and explosive short-term travel for shopping, has led to substantial health risks including air pollution, occupational and traffic hazards, and altered diets and activity.166 All of these changes in human activity, together with increased contact between human beings and their pets and nature, have probably contributed to the increasing abundance of tick exposure, as reported in other developed countries.164 Further investigation is needed to show the relation between emerging tick-borne diseases and urbanisation in mainland China.",

An increase in winter temperatures is known to cause the northward extension and increased abundance of Ixodes ricinus, which subsequently raises the risk of tick-borne disease dissemination.167, 168, 169 Although this topic is still under debate, climatic change could have a role in the emergence of tick-borne diseases in China.

Most physicians are unfamiliar with the many tick-borne diseases that present with non-specific symptoms in the early stages of the illness. The wide distributions of the 33 emerging tick-associated agents and their tick vectors, in addition to the diversity of tick species throughout mainland China, imply that reported cases of infection might be only the tip of the iceberg in regard to the actual number of tick-borne diseases. To develop a reasonable differential diagnosis and identify a specific pathogen, laboratory diagnostic methods that are rapid, convenient, and practical are urgently needed for these emerging tick-borne diseases. Although great progress has been made in mainland China in the detection and identification of various tick-borne pathogens and diagnosis of the infections they cause, the necessary technologies are still unavailable in most general hospitals. Unfortunately, the importance of tick-borne diseases to human and animal health has not been sufficiently recognised as a result of inaccessibility to laboratory tests for aetiological diagnosis and inadequate surveillance activities.",

Despite increasing knowledge about their geographical distribution, the natural cycle of these agents and the natural history of their infection in tick vectors and animal hosts have yet to be elucidated. Identifying human infections after potentially pathogenic agents are identified in ticks could take many years, in part because the microbial loads are much lower in human blood than in arthropods.184 For example, R sibirica sp BJ-90 was first identified in D sinicus ticks in China in 1990,7 but was not discovered to infect human beings until 22 years later.46 Similarly, A phagocytophilum was initially detected in China in 1997;15 however, nosocomial transmission of human granulocytic anaplasmosis was not recognised until 10 years later.73 As such, the 18 tick-associated agents that have been recognised in China in either ticks or animals represent potential candidates for new tick-borne human diseases. Likewise, a search for potential new pathogens in ticks is essential for the discovery of emerging tick-borne diseases in human beings.",

Except for eight species (Dermacentor abaensis, Dermacentor daghestanicus, Haemaphysalis bispinosa, H flava, Haemaphysalis sinensis, Haemaphysalis yeni, Ixodes myospalacis, and Rhipicephalus turanicus), most species carry two or more agents. Conversely, some emerging agents such as R heilongjiangensis, E chaffeensis, A phagocytophilum, and B garinii can infect several tick species. Additionally, tick-borne pathogens that infect domestic animals might eventually cause human disease. A representative example is B divergens, which has long been recognised to cause cattle babesiosis in Europe, and was subsequently identified as a human pathogen.185 In China, a wide range of emerging tick-borne agents are known to infect various domestic animals (appendix), and their potential capability to infect humans warrants great attention and further investigation. With the continued emergence of tick-borne diseases in mainland China, improving our understanding of the existence and health burden of these diseases is essential for China and for the rest of the world.",
