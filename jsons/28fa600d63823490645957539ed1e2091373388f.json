Early detection with fast and sensitive assays and timely intervention are crucial for interrupting the spread of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Using a mismatch-tolerant amplification technique, we developed a simple, rapid, sensitive and visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on its N gene. The assay has a high specificity and sensitivity, and robust reproducibility, and its results can be monitored using a real-time PCR machine or visualized via colorimetric change from red to yellow. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay is 118.6 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per 25 \u00b5L reaction. The reaction can be completed within 30 min for real-time fluorescence monitoring, or 40 min for visual detection when the template input is more than 200 copies per 25 \u00b5L reaction. To evaluate the viability of the assay, a comparison between the RT-LAMP and a commercial RT-qPCR assay was made using 56 clinical samples. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay showed perfect agreement in detection with the RT-qPCR assay. The newly-developed SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay is a simple and rapid method for COVID-19 surveillance.",

However, the RT-qPCR assay requires sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel, and it is relatively time-consuming (about 1.5-2 h), which limits its capacity to meet the demand for detecting the virus in a rapidly growing number of patients with COVID-19 infection, suspected infection, or close contact with confirmed cases.

Early diagnosis, and the timely implementation of intervention and quarantine measures, are crucial to prevent the spread of the virus and optimize clinical management. Therefore, the development of simple, rapid and reliable diagnostic assays is of high priority for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Many RT-qPCR assays have been developed since the outbreak, and contributed to the confirmation of most SARS-CoV-2 infections during the pandemic in China [3, 9, 12] . Currently, although the COVID-19 pandemic has been contained following the strong public health intervention efforts of the Chinese government, the virus is spreading quickly outside China, including into some resource-limited areas. The stringent requirements of facilities and professional workers, and its time-consuming nature, limit the use of RT-qPCR assays in some undeveloped countries. Furthermore, the presence of asymptomatic infections and the long incubation period of COVID-19 increase the difficulty of diagnosis, because some SARS-CoV-2 carriers may not visit the hospital for diagnosis due to lack of symptoms or signs of infection [21] . Therefore, simple, rapid and sensitive POCT detection assays, that can be deployed more widely, will be very helpful for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and should be developed.",

In the real-time monitoring system, SYTO9 is used as a fluorescent dye which has a minimal inhibitory effect on LAMP amplification [10, 14] . In the visual detection system, cresol red is used as a pH indicator dye because of a clear color contrast between negative (red) and positive (yellow) reactions after 40 min of incubation at 63 \u2022 C; a color change from red to orange or yellow is defined as SARS-CoV-2 positive [24] .",

In particular, when the template input is more than the LOD, the assay has a very fast detection speed of less than 20 min. The robustness of the novel assay was tested using 56 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients and control populations in Nantong. The novel RT-LAMP assay showed a high consistency (92.9%) with a commercial RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. There were four samples showing inconsistent results by both the RT-qPCR assay and the novel RT-LAMP assay. The reason for two samples testing positive by the RT-qPCR assay but negative by the RT-LAMP assay may be the very low copy numbers (having high CT values of >38 in the RT-qPCR assay). However, regarding the other two samples tested positive by the RT-LAMP assay (with a high time threshold of >45 min) but negative by the RT-qPCR assay, the reason is speculated to be the presence of viral variants, that have caused mismatches with the primers and/or probe [11, 14] .",

In view of a mean viral load of 1.4 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL in nasal swabs of COVID-19 patients, the novel assay is sufficiently sensitive for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage of infection using nasal swab specimens. Recently, the nucleic acid extraction-free protocol of the LAMP assay was developed by directly adding NaOH-treated swabs into the reaction [25] .

Validation using 56 clinical samples confirmed that the RT-LAMP assay's performance was similar to that of the RT-qPCR assay in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Although their specificity regarding SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was not tested, in view of the lethal nature of these two coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, a positive result for any of these three coronaviruses might be of clinical importance. The novel SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay has been developed into real-time monitoring and colorimetric versions, both of which will be especially useful in COVID-19 surveillance.",
