Some of these viruses cause outbreaks among humans annually, while others decimate chickens in farms and can infect humans fatally1\u20134. There are four types of viruses, A\u2013D; type A is the most virulent and consists of eight segments of the RNA genome, which frequently undergoes mutation during replication, leading to an annual drift in viral genomes. Moreover, they may exchange genome segments among different types, causing a shift or reassortment that produces a new set of viruses, when they infect a same cell1\u20133. As swine can be infected by various viruses, they are considered as a mixing vessel that produces a new virus3,5. Vaccines would be useful to prevent outbreaks of this virus1. However, this requires an estimation of the types that would cause an outbreak during the following season. To achieve this, we should determine how the viruses have changed.",

They not only change annually but are transferred from other species or emerge from unsuspected regions and can then spread worldwide.

The method presented here divided the types of viruses into three large groups (Fig. 1A). As the differences among the samples were large, to ease the alignment, amino acid sequences were analysed in Fig. 1. In panel A, the distances among the types were \u22650.5 (Fig. S1A); this value shows the average rate of the difference at any residue between pairs of sequences6. The sPC values are the projections of those distances on the PC axes, which concentrate at certain sets of residues (Fig. S1B). Each axis contributes to some part of the differences (Fig. S1C). Viruses were classified based on antigenic differences of other segments; however, the segregation showed likely differences in HA as well. The viruses differed by several indels; in particular, types C and D had extra domains that conferred different activities. Moreover, type A class viruses were further segregated into three groups (Fig. 1B), and the clusters were further classified into lower PCs, showing the characteristics of the subtypes (Fig. S1, Table of PC for samples).",

The groups that include the segments of the two pandemic viruses, Russia 1977 and Mexico 2009, are termed R and M, respectively, with U being the remaining group. As the distances among the groups are similar in all segments, they were placed similarly on the plots (Fig. S2). Variations in the rotation angle of the triangle were caused by differences in the number of samples among the groups. Fig. S2 includes several very old strains: the 1918 and 1943 human pandemic strains (green) and the 1930 swine strains (grey); they showed a tendency to be located closer to the origin of the plot. The magnitudes of PCs were similar among the segments, showing that the groups were separated by similar distances. This suggests a constant mutation rate among the segments, which might be branched from the ancestral strain coincidentally as a new set of viruses. The complete separations observed negate the possibility of homologous recombination between viruses, which would yield some intermediates among the groups. Those of the 1930 swine strain may be an exception among the intermediates, which will be discussed below.",

As the lives of humans span several decades, they might be immune to viruses that appeared in the past. This may represent a selective pressure to viruses. Moreover, humans may travel to other countries by air while carrying viruses. Hence, the viruses spread worldwide, unifying the outbreaking strains. Although changes in one to several residues may be sufficient to escape specific antibody defenses1, humans have various antibodies that target different epitopes. The drifts that occur within a year would be insufficient for viral spread in the same district; hence, H1 outbreaks occurring in two consecutive years were rare (Figs. 2D and S5).

Many variations were present coincidently in any given year, especially in recent years, when the sequences became available from various areas. Such a variety may hide the effects of drifts from higher axes of the PCA. In fact, the PC values formed horizontal rows in the plots. However, the variations detected in an area did not change much, even in lower PC axes (Fig. S4B,C). The small changes may result from differences in the districts that were surveyed in specific years, rather than from those caused by drifts. Moreover, strains that may be transmitted from humans to swine were detected several years after the human epidemics; this may have occurred if the strains were kept unchanged among swine (Fig. 3A,B). These observations suggest that livestock viruses are rather conserved. Each district may keep its own set of a virus library and we may be observing only a limited portion of the variation. The conserved character of these viruses suggests the presence of a weaker selective pressure for newer epitopes. The variety suggests an absence of competition among viruses; i.e., they might have a limited ability to migrate.",

Here, we presented views that are very different from those of previous studies. The discrepancies were generated by differences in the methodologies, because many of the data analysed were common among studies. Here, we wish to show that our study has better falsifiability6. A sequence matrix is essentially composed of multivariate data with a large number of dimensions6. Previous studies used tree-based models (Fig. 1) which can handle only a single dimension7; such tree models have to ignore the real data structure. The understanding of clusters requires advanced judgement calls; hence, it may fail easily and the comparison of the results of different segments or types is difficult. In contrast, PCA does not have limitations regarding the shape of presentations or the number of dimensions; thus, it has better objectivity6. For instance, the attributions of clusters presented in Figs. 1C and S2 should not cause confusion. Moreover, the assumption that \u201cthe relationship among samples should be a tree-like structure\u201d cannot be verified. Our analyses are free from such assumptions. One of the major differences observed was the direct shift from avian to swine or human viruses. Although these shifts were thought to explain the 19185,13,16 and 20098,9,11 pandemic viruses, the segments of avian viruses were separated from any swine or human segments, even those that were thought to be close to the source (Fig. S2, A, orange)17. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate such direct shifts. In fact, the cluster called \u201ctriple reassortant\u201d disappeared (Fig. 2S); this class was detected as a pandemic swine H3N2 virus17 and also presented some clusters of H1N18,9,11. Although avian viruses might be the origin of the H1 viruses, they might have a limited capacity to infect swine or humans, and vice versa. Among the samples studied here, there was only one example of such transmittance, which may have occurred from humans to turkeys (NCBI taxonomy ID: 1848980) in contrast to the occasional transmittance observed between humans and swine (Figs. 1C and 4A,B). The three groups, R, M, and U, may have branched out from the origin to achieve better infectivity in swine or humans (Fig. 5). The 1943 human strain may represent an earlier process of branching out (Fig. S2). Swine may be the origin of the 1918 pandemic virus, i.e., the 1930 swine strain may be a derivative of this group of viruses.",

In the last few years, drifting was not observed in PC1, which records positions that changed only once (Fig. 2A, grey). It seems that few positions that were amenable to variation were left unchanged, and that spontaneous mutation failed to hit those positions (Fig. S3C, positions located on the surface of HA and not marked).

The livestock strains differed among districts and remained constant for years. The conservative nature of these viral sequences may be attributed to the short life-span of livestock. As they rarely live for a year, they are not immune to viruses that spread over the previous year. Hence, these viruses are not under a selective pressure toward the formation of newer epitopes. Likely, a conservative character was also found in our preliminary studies of human infection with filoviruses and coronaviruses (not shown). Moreover, because livestock rarely move around, the area of viral transmission is limited. For example, even the very infectious pandemic avian virus of 2004 was unable to spread worldwide. Instead, it infected a limited number of farms2. This limitation precludes a competition among strains, which enabling the maintenance of unique strains in small, separate areas. Some of the strains that are retained may include segments that spread among humans in the past. It is even possible that several human viruses are kept intact among swine. Such collections may be the source of the 1977 pandemic virus, which is thought to be a frozen laboratory strain that was released accidentally4,18.",

Moreover, the exchange of genomes between human and swine viruses may give rise to a new strain with new sets of surface proteins that is able to infect humans. The Switzerland virus (NCBI taxonomy ID: 940568) proved that the group U strain is also capable of infecting humans; therefore, a new pandemic may occur in the case of an outbreak of this type of virus.

This observation was unexpected because mutations may lead to malfunction; if they are not the target of immunity, they should be conserved, similar to those of livestock viruses. As the segments are displayed on the surface of infected cells, they will activate specific immune cells, which may play important roles in the human immune system.",

In contrast to the case of the H3N2 viruses, H1N1 outbreaks rarely occur in two consecutive seasons (Figs. 2D and S5). This shows that most people exposed to the virus are infected asymptomatically during the viral outbreak and become immune; otherwise, the virus could infect a portion of receptive people that were not infected in the previous year. Also, the drift occurring in a single year is insufficient for escaping the immune system. The pdm09 virus appeared after the flu season and spread worldwide from April 2009 to March 2010 (Fig. S5). The extraordinary infectivity of this virus may have been caused by epitopes that were new to humans. Therefore, the present system of vaccine production to control influenza infections, which uses eggs, has a critical defect: i.e., none of the stock strains that are used for viral production are the one that will cause an outbreak in the following season. The population might have become immune to the stock viruses and the vaccine just helps to recall the memory of these strains.",
