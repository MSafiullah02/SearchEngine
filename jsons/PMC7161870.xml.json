To evaluate the ability of the molecules to inhibit the replication of MERS\u2010CoV, viral infectivity was determined by monitoring the cells expressing spike (S) protein using immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Vero cells were seeded in 384\u2010well \u03bc\u2010clear plates at a density of 1.2 \u00d7 104 cell per well in 30 \u03bcL SFM and incubated for 24 h prior to infection. Compounds were transferred from the library into intermediate 384\u2010well polypropylene plates containing SFM and were mixed using an automated liquid handling. Subsequently, the diluted compounds were added to the cell plates in 10 \u03bcL volumes (final DMSO concentration of 0.5% (v/v)). For infection, the plates were transferred into the BSL\u20103 containment facility prior to adding 10 \u03bcL MERS\u2010CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0625. The cells were fixed at 24 hpi with 4% PFA and the infected cells were identified by IFA as described below.",

In the analyzed image, the total number of cells and the number of infected cells were determined by counting Hoechst\u2010stained nuclei and spike protein\u2010expressing cells, respectively. The infection ratio of each well was normalized using the average infection ratio of mock control as 0% and the average infection ratio of negative control (0.5% DMSO) as 100%, in each assay plate. Cell ratio was determined according to the number of cells of each well versus the average number of cells of mock control, in each assay plate.",
