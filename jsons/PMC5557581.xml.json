            "text": "The Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) antigenic complex comprises a group of alphaviruses that share similar genetic characteristics and can be defined by broad cross-reactivity antigenically [1] which defines them as a group within the Alphaviridae. The VEE complex alphaviruses are classified into six subtypes, designated I to VI, and consist of 9 species [2], of which subtype I contains the veterinary and medically important VEE virus (VEEV) (Table 1). Historically, the VEE complex subtypes I-VI were defined by serological analysis, and this nomenclature has persisted. However, the advent of sequencing resulted in several viruses now being reclassified as distinct species. For example, subtype IF is genetically distinct from the remainder of the subtype I viruses and is now classified as the species Mosso das Pedras virus. Most VEE complex viruses have enzootic cycles where they circulate between wild animals, generally rodents and mosquitoes, particularly Culex (Melanoconion) spp. mosquito vectors. With the exception of VEEV subtype II, VEE complex viruses are geographically distributed throughout Central and South America. VEEV subtype II is found only in Florida and is usually transmitted by Culex cedeci mosquitoes. The recent appearance for the first time of Culex (Melanoconion) species in southern Florida [3] underscores the continuing threat of emergence, possibly enhanced by climate change, which also increases the potential for other VEEV subtypes to spread northwards and establish enzootic transmission cycles. Although many VEE complex viruses have not been implicated in human disease, those that are associated with human disease (VEEV) can cause acute, often severe febrile illness that may progress to encephalitis, causing severe human morbidity and mortality [4]. Patients who survive encephalitis are often left with permanent neurologic sequelae, and the cost for treatment and long-term care related to a single case can be several million dollars [5]. In addition to VEEV(subtype I), which cases the majority of the encephalitis cases within the VEE subtype, subtype II Everglades virus (EVEV), which is found only in Florida, can cause neurologic disease in humans [6] and equids [7]. Subtype IIIA, Mucambo virus, also causes febrile disease in humans [8, 9].",

            "text": "VEEV is associated with human disease, and is further subdivided into subtypes IAB, IC, ID, IE. Subtypes ID and IE comprise enzootic/endemic strains that circulate continuously in forests and swamps of northern South America, Central America and Mexico and cause a large burden of endemic disease from direct spillover [10]. The remaining VEEV subtypes, IAB and IC, comprise epizootic/epidemic strains that are associated with periodic equine-amplified outbreaks that result in severe disease in equids and extensive spillover to humans [11]. These outbreaks can spread from South America as far north as the southern United States [12, 13], resulting in up to hundreds-of-thousands of cases over a period of months to a few years. Prior to the 1980s, VEE epizootics involving high case-fatality rates were frequently recorded. Because horses have been an important component of the local agricultural economies within many Latin American regions, VEE has often had a sizeable economic impact as well as a direct effect on public and veterinary health [14]. Recent outbreaks during the 1990s in Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico have demonstrated the potential for VEEV to re-emerge periodically from enzootic progenitors [15\u201318]. The emergence of VEEV into an epidemic/epizootic form has been associated with specific mutations that arise in the VEEV envelope glycoprotein 2 (E2) gene of enzootic subtype ID or IE strains. These mutations result in the addition of positively charged amino acid changes on the surface of the virion spikes [19] that give rise to increased virulence and viremia in equids [20, 21] and sometimes enhanced infection of epidemic vector mosquitoes such as Aedes (Ochlerotatus) taeniorhynchus [22]. The higher viremia levels in equids can lead to infection of mosquitoes that are not normally involved in enzootic circulation [23], which can then result in spillover infections of humans and other domestic animals.",

BEAST employs a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to infer demographic histories, evolutionary rates and dates of divergence from serially (dated) sampled sequence data. Statistical uncertainty in the data is reflected in the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) values. Analyses were typically performed using the Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP) model of population growth, which does not use a pre-specified demographic model [43]. We used this model because the VEE complex would not all show the same patterns of demographic change and this did not impose constraints on the different subtypes of VEEV. To estimate substitution rate variation among lineages we used the models implemented in the BEAST program [44] including the uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) model for the VEEV IE strains and the uncorrelated exponential (UCEX) model for the VEEV ID/II/IAB/IC strains as these were determined to be the most accurate model using the stepping stone algorithm implemented in BEAST [45]. The MCMC chain was 100 million generations long, thinned to include every 5000th generation in the final sample. The program Tracer version 1.5 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) was used to confirm convergence and mixing. The software TreeAnnotator version 1.7.1 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/TreeAnnotator) was used to summarize the data output from BEAST.

To prevent over-fitting, we implemented a step-up procedure via an adaptive BSREL model (aBSREL; [52]), starting with a single dN/dS class on each branch and testing the fit of an additional dN/dS class using small-sample corrected Akaike information criteria (c-AIC).",

To test our hypothesis that, like other ancient RNA viruses [48\u201350], dating estimates may be biased in the VEE complex due to the presence of strong purifying selection, we employed a branch-site random effects likelihood (BSREL) approach to determine the extent to which branch lengths (and tMRCAs) were underestimated by standard models of nucleotide evolution. By moving up through the VEE complex phylogeny in an iterative process, we removed the most basal lineages and compared total tree length optimized under BSREL and GTR+\u03934, thereby identifying subtrees whose branch lengths did not expand under BSREL compared with a standard nucleotide model (GTR+\u03934) (Figs 1 & 2). We assert that it is these subtrees, which were not underestimated by GTR+\u03934, whose tMRCA can be reliably inferred by standard Bayesian molecular clock dating (e.g. BEAST) (Fig 2).",

The subtype IAB/IC/ID VEEV strains fell into two main groups, a Panamanian lineage and a Venezuelan/Colombian lineage. In addition, we sequenced two additional strains MAC10 and MHC88 from Venezuela, which are outliers from the rest of the ID/IAB/IC strains (Fig 3). These strains showed that VEEV has been circulating in its current form for around 253 years, although the date of this node could not be accurately determined as determined by the BSREL analysis. In fact only group K (Figs 1 and 3), which fell within the Colombian/Venezuelan lineage could be reliably dated at 1934 (1904\u20131950) (without BSREL correction). The Venezuelan samples MAC10 and MHC88 were basal to the rest of the strains. Within the Venezuelan/Colombian and Panamanian lineages, the Peruvian strains were present in both lineages and, given the shape of the tree and the distribution of these viruses, it is most likely that they represent recent introductions. Although synapomorphic amino acids were identified for the major lineages of the ID subtype (see S2 Fig) the distribution of the amino acid substitutions between the structural and non-structural proteins for each lineage was not significantly different from expected based on a random distribution across the genome.",

However, the presence of purifying selection can bias such analyses, and our attempts to date the entire VEE complex were limited by this bias. Analysis of ID/IAB/IC strains revealed two main lineages. One circulates primarily in Panama, with a few Peruvian strains included. The origin of this group was estimated at around 102 years ago, although confidence limits were broad. From the phylogeny we were able to infer that circulation of VEEV may have been present initially in Panama, with a subsequent introduction into Peru. The exact mechanism of introduction into Peru is not understood; the enzootic cycle of VEEV involves rodents and mosquitoes that have limited geographic range, suggesting other mechanisms of transport such as birds may be occasionally be involved in virus movement. The presence of Peruvian sequences in two distinct lineages suggests that there have been at least two independent introductions. Exclusion of VEEV subtypes III-VI and the lack of isolates from countries intermediate between Panama and Peru will therefore limit the possibility of fully resolving the ancestral dispersal of these viruses.",

Previous partial sequencing and analysis of these strains suggested that some of the IAB outbreaks were a result of incompletely inactivated vaccines [27]. We were able to corroborate this finding using full genome strains that showed tight genetic distance (96.08\u201399.23%), and no identified ID progenitors (i.e. strains that are genetically related but lack the defining E2 mutations that are associated with the IAB subtypes), although this could be due to inaccurate sampling. However, compared to the spacing of the strains comprising the IC subtype, which are not known to have been used for vaccine production and are interspersed throughout the phylogeny, all the IAB strains appear to have a single origin, and previous analyses have shown that these cluster with vaccine strains used around the time these viruses were circulating [27].",

The IC strains are found within 2 distinct clades in the VEEV phylogeny, particularly in the Colombian/Venezuelan lineage. However, our data suggest that no IC epizootic/epidemic strains have arisen from the Panamanian lineage. It is possible that epistatic interactions limit the emergence of IC epidemic mutations from these Panamanian ID strains, as has been described for chikungunya virus emergence [60, 61]. Despite strong experimental evidence that substitutions in the E2 protein mediate adaptation for equine amplification or bridge vector infection involved in epizootic VEE emergence [21, 57], our sequence analyses failed to detect positive selection on the corresponding codons (Table 2). This finding underscores the limitations of current dN/dS methods for identifying unique adaptive substitutions occurring during virus evolution, as they typically require repeated substitution events at a given site to detect adaptive evolution.",

More surveillance in Panama is required to determine if these VEEV IE subtypes are still circulating. The main VEEV IE lineage is subdivided into two clades: a widely dispersed group with strains from Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico (Pacific Coast lineage) and a group with more limited dispersal circulating mainly in Mexico (Gulf Coast lineage). As is expected of a rodent-hosted arbovirus, there is very little spread among countries and the dispersal within the IE subtype appears to occur between neighboring countries, presumably reflecting the limited mobility of rodents and mosquitoes (Fig 4). Given the limited number of countries represented in the IE phylogeny and the lack of recent sampling in most countries, it is hard to draw further conclusions about the historical spread of this subtype within Central America. However, recent detailed studies of VEEV circulation in Mexico demonstrate geographic stability of independently evolving lineages in that country [62].",

Using these expanded sequences we observed 63 synapomorphic mutations associated with the IE subtype (Group H). Of these, 39 were in the non-structural protein genes and 37 in the structural genes. This finding was significantly different from an expected, random distribution throughout the VEEV genome. It is possible that the preponderance of structural protein substitutions reflects adaptation to different mosquito vectors. Subtype ID strains are vectored by at least three mosquito species: Cx. (Melanoconion) adamesi, Cx. (Mel.) vomerifer and Cx. (Mel.) pedroi [63], whereas the subtype IE strains appear to be more specialized and vectored nearly exclusively by Cx. (Mel.) taeniopus [64]. Experimental infections with subtypes IAB, IC and ID have demonstrated poor infectivity at the level of midgut infection, suggesting specific subtype IE adaptation to this vector [64, 65]. Although the true distributions of Cx. taeniopus and Cx. pedroi are not completely certain because they were not distinguished until 1980 [66], recent collection records and revisions [63, 67\u201373] suggest that the former is restricted to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, while the latter occurs throughout northern South America and Central America, as well as in Mexico. Additionally, neither Cx. vomerifer or Cx. adamesi, both subtype ID vectors, are found north of Panama [74, 75], which may restrict the distribution of the ID subtype. Regardless of the original mechanism of spatial compartmentalization, between these subtypes, the IE strains appear to have adapted specifically to Cx. taeniopus while the other subtypes remain poorly infectious for this species [76].",

Purifying selection is an inherent determinant of arbovirus evolution because of the alternating vector-host transmission and could therefore introduce bias into coalescent analyses of similar viruses. By restricting this bias by analyzing only those clades for which the BSREL analysis indicated that standard nucleotide models would not introduce severe bias we were able to robustly estimate the tMRCA of several VEEV lineages. Evolution of the IE subtype appears to have been characterized by a significant evolutionary shift from the rest of the VEEV complex, with an increase in structural protein substitutions that may reflect adaptation to its mosquito vector. Additionally our inferred tree topologies, suggest that VEEV is maintained primarily in limited geographic foci with only occasional spread to neighboring countries, probably reflecting the limited mobility of rodent hosts and mosquito vectors. Additional strains of subtypes II-VI are needed to more completely characterize the evolution of the entire VEE complex of alphaviruses.",
