In addition to the lipid membranes that pose a physical barrier to virus entry, membrane\u2010associated proteins can deter virus entry by altering the biophysical properties of lipid membranes (Schoggins and Randall, 2013). One example of these proteins is the interferon\u2010induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins that inhibit the entry of diverse viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), flaviviruses, filoviruses and others (Diamond and Farzan, 2013; Perreira et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Humans have five IFITM proteins, known as IFITM1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 (Siegrist et al., 2011). IFITM5 is only expressed in osteoblasts and participates in bone mineralization and maturation (Moffatt et al., 2008). The function of IFITM10 remains unknown (Hickford et al., 2012). IFITM1, 2 and 3 all respond to stimulation by type I interferon (Lewin et al., 1991), and inhibit many viruses including IAV, flaviviruses (West Nile virus, dengue virus), filoviruses (Ebola virus, Marburg virus), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), SARS coronavirus, reovirus, Rift Valley fever virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101) (Brass et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2010; Weidner et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011; Schoggins et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2012; Anafu et al., 2013). The in vivo importance of IFITM3 in antiviral defence is demonstrated by the much higher mortality and morbidity of ifitm3\u2010knockout mice upon IAV infection as compared to the wild\u2010type mice (Bailey et al., 2012; Everitt et al., 2012). In addition, the hospitalized IAV patients showed significant enrichment of a single\u2010nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ifitm3 gene that impairs the anti\u2010IAV function of IFITM3 (Everitt et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013), although an association of this SNP with mild influenza but not severe H1N1 infection was also reported (Mills et al., 2013). One mechanism of this in vivo role of IFITM3 is that its expression protects the lung resident memory CD8(+) T cells from infection by influenza viruses as well as from subsequent virus exposures (Wakim et al., 2013).",

An inhibition of membrane fusion by IFITM was shown by the reduction of cell to cell fusion that is mediated by the envelope proteins of IAV and JSRV as well as other class II and III fusion proteins (Li et al., 2013). This inhibition of cell fusion is rescued by a lipid analogue known as oleic acid that confers negative membrane curvature and promotes membrane hemifusion, suggesting that IFITM proteins impede the creation of hemifusion (Li et al., 2013). The underlying mechanism may involve decrease in membrane fluidity (Li et al., 2013), which is supported by an elevation of cholesterol in multivesicular bodies and late endosomes as a result of IFITM3 interaction with VAPA (Vesicle\u2010membrane\u2010protein\u2010associated protein A) and consequently the dissociation of VAPA from the cholesterol sensor OSBP (oxysterol\u2010binding protein) (Amini\u2010Bavil\u2010Olyaee et al., 2013).",

            "text": "IFITM proteins inhibit viruses that enter cells at different subcellular sites. Among these viruses under IFITM inhibition, HIV\u20101 entry is pH\u2010independent and is generally believed to occur at the plasma membrane (Blumenthal et al., 2012). VSV and IAV are pH\u2010dependent viruses, but require different pH optima to trigger viral membrane fusion. VSV entry occurs at pH 6.2 in the early endosome, whereas the membrane fusion of IAV takes place at pH 5.5 in late endosomes and lysosomes (Vazquez\u2010Calvo et al., 2012). In order to inhibit these diverse viruses, IFITM proteins need to be present at these various portals of virus entry. Indeed, in addition to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are synthesized and modified, IFITM1, 2 and 3 are also located at the plasma membrane, endosomes and lysosomes, albeit at different levels (Yount et al., 2010; 2012; Feeley et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013). Currently, it is largely unclear what is the trafficking itinerary of IFITM proteins between these cellular membrane compartments, what signals control IFITM trafficking, and how the signalling mechanisms regulate the antiviral action of IFITM proteins. In addition to the roles of palmitoylation and ubiquitination in modulating the subcellular localization of IFITM3 (Yount et al., 2010; 2012), a key role of the Y20 residue in this regard has also been reported (Jia et al., 2012; John et al., 2013). Yet, the mechanism behind this role of Y20 has not been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we provide evidence that IFITM3 bears a tyrosine\u2010based classic sorting signal, 20\u2010YEML\u201023 of which Y20 is located, that enables IFITM3 to undergo endocytosis and is essential for IFITM3 to inhibit viruses. Although the sorting function of 20\u2010YEML\u201023 per se is not a surprise, our results demonstrate IFITM3 as an endocytic protein and more importantly, this property is essential for IFITM3 to inhibit pH\u2010dependent viruses that enter cells via endocytosis.",

In order to determine whether 20\u2010YEML\u201023 is functionally important for IFITM3 trafficking, we mutated the conserved Y20 and L23 residues and generated a group of IFITM3 mutants (Fig. 1A). We first characterized these mutants by examining their subcellular localizations. We found that, in contrast to the wild\u2010type IFITM3, which is colocalized with endocytosed transferrin, all mutants were accumulated at the cell periphery (Fig. 1B). This observation supports our previous finding that deletion of Y20 causes relocalization of IFITM3 to the plasma membrane (Jia et al., 2012). These data together suggest the importance of 20\u2010YEML\u201023 in determining the subcellular distribution of IFITM3.",

To demonstrate this, we first tried to detect cell surface IFITM3 by immunostaining. The N\u2010Flag IFITM3 (with a Flag tag added to the N\u2010terminus) was expressed in HEK293 cells followed incubating the cells with anti\u2010Flag antibody on ice for 30 min. We washed off the unbound antibodies, fixed the cells and imaged for cell surface IFITM3. No apparent fluorescence signal was detected from intact non\u2010permeabilized cells, although the presence of intracellular IFITM3 was shown by the results of staining the detergent\u2010permeabilized cells (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12262/suppinfo). Similarly, the N\u2010Flag YLAA mutant was undetectable on the cell surface with the anti\u2010Flag antibody staining, although this mutant was clearly located at the plasma membrane (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12262/suppinfo). This result suggests that the N\u2010terminal region of IFITM3 is located within the cytoplasm, which is consistent with the published data (Yount et al., 2012; Bailey et al., 2013).",

In contrast to the N\u2010Flag IFITM3, the C\u2010Flag version was readily detected on the cell surface with anti\u2010Flag antibody staining at 4\u00b0C, suggesting extracellular exposure of the C\u2010terminal sequence of IFITM3 (Fig. 1C). Not surprisingly, the C\u2010Flag YLAA mutant was also detected on the cell surface with anti\u2010Flag antibody (Fig. 1C). We then performed the antibody uptake experiments by switching the cells to 37\u00b0C for 15 min following incubation with anti\u2010Flag antibody on ice. The anti\u2010Flag antibody\u2010bound C\u2010Flag IFITM3 was detected inside the cells and colocalized with the endocytosed transferrin (Fig. 1C). However, the C\u2010Flag YLAA mutant remained at cell periphery, suggesting a defect in endocytosis (Fig. 1C). To validate this observation, we added a different tag, the Myc tag, to the N\u2010 or C\u2010terminus of IFITM3 and performed the same antibody uptake and immunostaining experiments. Again, the C\u2010Myc IFITM3, not the N\u2010Myc form, was detected by the anti\u2010Myc antibody at the cell surface, and the C\u2010Myc IFITM3/anti\u2010Myc antibody complex was internalized following incubation at 37\u00b0C (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12262/suppinfo). In order to validate the imaging data showing the luminal/extracellular exposure of the C\u2010terminus of IFITM3, we used flow cytometry to score the cells that were stained with the anti\u2010Myc antibody either under the non\u2010permeabilization condition (cell surface expression) or under the permeabilization condition (total expression). Equal numbers of positively stained cells were measured for C\u2010Myc IFITM3 regardless the cells were permeabilized or not, as opposed to the N\u2010Myc IFITM3 whose cell\u2010surface expression was seen in less than 20% of IFITM3\u2010expressing cells (Fig. 1D). Our data support the model that IFITM3 is a type II transmembrane protein (Bailey et al., 2013).",

A 60 min treatment with dynasore, as compared to the 15 min treatment, more effectively blocked the endocytosis of transferrin and caused relocation of IFITM3 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). Similar effect was observed with CPZ treatment (Fig. 2B).

            "text": "The Yxx\u03a6 sorting signal is recognized by the \u03bc subunit of the AP complex. Five AP complexes have been discovered among which AP\u20101, 2, 3 and 4, are well characterized (Bonifacino and Traub, 2003; Hirst et al., 2011). Each AP has one \u03bc subunit except for AP\u20101 and AP\u20103 that have two isoforms of \u03bc. To determine which of these \u03bc subunits recognizes the 20\u2010YEML\u201023 motif in IFITM3, we expressed the Flag\u2010IFITM3 along with each of \u03bc1A\u2010Myc, \u03bc1B\u2010Myc, \u03bc2\u2010Myc, \u03bc3A\u2010Myc, \u03bc3B\u2010Myc or \u03bc4\u2010Myc. The \u03bc\u2010Myc proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti\u2010Myc antibody, and the presence of IFITM3 in the precipitated materials was examined in Western blotting. The results showed that IFITM3 was co\u2010immunoprecipitated with the \u03bc2 subunit, but not evidently with other \u03bc subunits tested (Fig. 3A). To demonstrate that this interaction is mediated by the 20\u2010YEML\u201023 motif, IFITM3 mutants with changes in this peptide motif were tested for co\u2010immunoprecipitation with \u03bc2. None of these mutants was associated with the \u03bc2 subunit (Fig. 3B). We noticed that the IFITM3 mutants, except for Y20F, migrated slower than the wild type, which may result from altered protein folding and/or loss of modification at Y20. We further tested two \u03bc2 mutants, WR/AA and FD/AS in which the Yxx\u03a6\u2010binding pocket are mutated (Carvajal\u2010Gonzalez et al., 2012). Again, we did not observe any interaction of these two mutants with wild\u2010type IFITM3 (Fig. 3C). Together, these data demonstrate a YEML\u2010dependent interaction between IFITM3 and the \u03bc2 subunit. This specific interaction may result from either the frequent trafficking of IFITM3 from the plasma membrane to the endosomes and/or the high affinity of the YEML motif for the \u03bc2 subunit. Our data do not completely exclude the possible weak interactions of IFITM3 with other \u03bc subunits. In support of this possibility, it has been shown that, in spite of the high affinity of the YEVM motif of the lysosomal protein CD63 for the \u03bc3 subunit, mutating \u03bc3 mislocalizes CD63 to the plasma membrane, which reveals the interaction of YEVM with \u03bc2 in the absence of wild\u2010type \u03bc3 (Rous et al., 2002).",

We first examined the effect of the two \u03bc2 mutants WR/AA and FD/AS on the subcellular distribution of IFITM3. In contrast to the ectopic expression of the wild\u2010type \u03bc2 subunit that did not affect the intracellular localization of IFITM3, the WR/AA and FD/AS mutants caused accumulation of IFITM3 on cell periphery, likely as a result of disrupting the function of endogenous AP\u20102 complex (Fig. 4A). We next knocked down \u03bc2 with siRNA oligos (Fig. 4B) and examined how cellular distribution of IFITM3 was affected. The results showed that \u03bc2 knock\u2010down effectively blocked the endocytosis of transferrin (Fig. 4C). The same \u03bc2 siRNA treatment led to the accumulation of IFITM3 at cell periphery (Fig. 4C). Although none of the four siRNA oligos completely depleted endogenous \u03bc2 (Fig. 4B), internalization of transferrin and IFITM3 was drastically reduced, which suggests that the level of \u03bc2 is a key determinant of endocytosis efficiency. We extended this study to knock down \u03bc2 in HeLa cells, and observed that, concomitant with the blockade of transferrin endocytosis, the endogenous IFITM3 was re\u2010located from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4D). Taken together, we conclude that the \u03bc2 subunit of AP\u20102 complex is functionally required for the endocytosis of IFITM3.",

We then challenged these HEK293 cells with IAV [A/WSN/33 (H1N1)], and assessed virus infection by measuring the levels of IAV proteins NP, M2 and HA by Western blotting. A drastic decrease in the levels of NP, M2 or HA was observed in IFITM3\u2010expressing cells as compared to the control cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, similar levels of IAV infection were observed in both control cells and cells expressing IFITM3 mutants (Fig. 5A). The loss of IAV inhibition by these IFITM3 mutants is not due to their poor expression because they were expressed as well as the wild\u2010type IFITM3 (Fig. 5A). We further assessed the anti\u2010IAV activities of wild\u2010type IFITM3 and its mutants using various doses of IAV for infection and scored the viral NP\u2010positive cells by flow cytometry. With the lowest dose of IAV that infected 13% of cells, IFITM3 reduced the number of infected cells by 17\u2010fold, whereas the Y20A, L23A and YLAA mutants exhibited a threefold inhibition (Fig. 5B and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12262/suppinfo).

Given that many viruses exploit endocytosis to enter cells (Mercer et al., 2010), trafficking along the endocytosis pathway provides IFITM3 with the opportunity to encounter and inhibit these viruses (Fig. 7). Regardless whether the virus hijacks the clathrin\u2010dependent or clathrin\u2010independent endocytosis route (Mercer et al., 2010), the endocytosed vesicles ultimately fuse with endosomal compartments and deliver their cargos, including the internalized viral particles, to late endosomes and lysosomes where the majority of IFITM3 molecules are located (Feeley et al., 2011). This subcellular localization allows IFITM3 to interfere with the entry of diverse viruses that enter cells via different endocytosis pathways. Because different viruses penetrate cellular membranes at different intracellular sites, some in the early endosomes such as VSV, while others in the late endosomes/lysosome such as IAV and EBOV (Fig. 7) (Vazquez\u2010Calvo et al., 2012), the extent of susceptibility to IFITM3 restriction likely vary among different viruses. One interesting example is the resistance of arenaviruses to IFITM3 restriction, which likely results from their entry via a clathrin\u2010 and caveolin\u2010independent endocytosis pathway (Brass et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Subcellular localization and trafficking of IFITM3 can be influenced by post\u2010translational modifications. Three types of post\u2010translational modifications have been reported for IFITM3. The first is S\u2010palmitoylation at cysteines 71, 72 and 105 (Yount et al., 2010). Mutating these cysteines do not affect the localization of IFITM3 at ER, but diminishes membrane\u2010binding and clustering properties of IFITM3. As a result, IFITM3 antiviral action is abrogated (Yount et al., 2012; John et al., 2013). The second is ubiquitination at lysines 24, 83, 88 and 104 with K24 as the major acceptor for ubiquitin (Yount et al., 2012). As opposed to S\u2010palmitoylation, eliminating IFITM3 ubiquitination by mutating these lysine residues promotes localization of IFITM3 to late endosomes and concomitantly enhances IFITM3's antiviral activity (Yount et al., 2012). One possible explanation is that ubiquitination at K24 occludes the recognition of the proximal 20\u2010YEML\u201023 sorting motif by \u03bc2 subunit of the AP\u20102 complex and thus impairs IFITM3 endocytosis (Fig. 7). Lastly, the Y20 amino acid is phosphorylated by the Fyn tyrosine kinase (Jia et al., 2012). Given that tyrosine phosphorylation in the Yxx\u03a6 motif hinders the recognition by \u03bc2 and consequently impedes AP\u20102\u2010dependent endocytosis (Bonifacino and Traub, 2003), it is likely that Y20 phosphorylation serves as a mechanism for cells to regulate the endocytosis efficiency and the subcellular localization of IFITM3.",

Deleting the first 21 amino acids prevents IFITM3 from inhibiting VSV and IAV (Weidner et al., 2010; Everitt et al., 2012). This loss of virus inhibition can be recapitulated by mutating only Y20 (Jia et al., 2012; John et al., 2013). In addition, a SNP rs12252\u2010C of IFITM3 is significantly enriched in hospitalized patients who suffered from seasonal and pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses (Everitt et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). This SNP causes aberrant splicing of IFITM3 mRNA and creates an IFITM3 mutant lacking the first 21 amino acids. Discovering 20\u2010YEML\u201023 as a functional sorting signal provides the molecular mechanism behind the key role of Y20 in IFITM3 antiviral activity that was reported in the above studies. It is noted that IFITM1 does not bear the YEML motif, yet it still exerts antiviral activity. We postulate that its C\u2010terminal sequence, which bears a YHIM motif, may control IFITM1 trafficking and antiviral function.",

Two other membrane topologies of IFITM3 were previously documented. One model stipulates that IFITM3 is a dual\u2010pass transmembrane protein with luminal/extracellular existence of both N\u2010 and C\u2010termini. This model is supported by the results of cell surface immunostaining and flow cytometry experiments showing the detection of the Flag tag attached to the N\u2010terminus of IFITM3 (Weidner et al., 2010). The second model describes IFITM3 as an intramembrane protein with both termini projecting towards the cytoplasm. In support of this latter membrane topology, none of the putative glycosylation sites within the distal N\u2010 or C\u2010terminal region of IFITM3 is modified (Yount et al., 2012). Furthermore, the K24 residue in the N\u2010terminal region is ubiquitinated, which can only occur when K24 is exposed to the intracellular E3 ligases. Our results support the cytoplasmic residence of the N\u2010terminal region of IFITM3, since cell surface staining with anti\u2010Flag or anti\u2010Myc antibody barely detected these N\u2010terminal tags. In the meantime, we were able to readily detect, at the cell surface, the Flag or the Myc tag that was added to the C\u2010terminus of IFITM3, which supports the luminal/extracellular exposure of the C\u2010terminal region of IFITM3 (Fig. 7). In further support of the luminal residence of the C\u2010terminus of IFITM3, appending an ER retention signal, KDEL, leads to ER sequestration of IFITM3 (Bailey et al., 2013). Moreover, the C\u2010terminus, but not the N\u2010terminus, of IFITM3 is subject to lysosomal degradation (Bailey et al., 2013). While more studies are warranted to reconcile these different observations, it is possible that the topologies of IFITM3 on membranes may be dynamic in nature, which depend on the different post\u2010translational modifications in different cell types.",
