For patients with low health literacy and education, we remained in contact via phone calls. We mailed trial drugs to those in clinical trials who lived further from our hospital (>1 h driving distance), to reduce exposure to hospital facilities. By Jan 13, most patients with IBD in our hospital were discharged, IBD clinics were closed, and routine, non-urgent medical care was moved online.

At the height of a pandemic, assuming mass community spread is vital and implementation of strict criteria for patients on immunosuppression is crucial.",
