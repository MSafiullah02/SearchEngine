Patients were identified using institutional trauma registries. Epidemiologic variables assessed included age, sex, admission to the hospital or an intensive care unit (ICU), injury severity score (ISS) and mechanism of injury. Minor and major trauma activations were grouped according to pre-existing trauma center-specific definitions. Patients were considered positive for alcohol if they had a blood alcohol level \u22650.08. Any drug identified on urine toxicology screen not administered during initial trauma assessment was considered a positive. Missing values were not included in the analysis, and variables with missing values are reported as such. Fisher\u2019s exact and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compare categorical and numerical variables respectively. P<0.05 was considered significant. This study was exempted by the Institutional Review Boards of both institutions.",

There was otherwise no change to the epidemiology of the traumatically injured patients presenting to these two institutions. To our knowledge, no trauma-specific assessments have occurred with prior infectious disease outbreaks where quarantine or shelter-in-place order was enforced. However, with both the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 and the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa in 2014 and 2015, similar drops in inpatient hospital admissions were identified.5 6 While the observed decrease in trauma activations inherently makes sense as there are fewer motor vehicles in use, the impact on interpersonal violence and mental health is not as clear.7 It is important to note, therefore, that our two centers have a high frequency of blunt traumatic injury; the reduction in trauma activations we observed may not be reflective of the experience in other locales, particularly those in large metropolitan areas with higher frequencies of penetrating trauma.",
