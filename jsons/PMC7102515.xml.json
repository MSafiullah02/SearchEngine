However, the intermediate host is not clear, and some studies suggest that pangolin is involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 [11,12]. It is not clear which mammals are involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and which animals may be infected by SARS-CoV-2. By sequence alignment of key amino acids binding to RBD in ACE2, the interaction between RBD of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV and mammalian ACE2 was predicted. Based on the potential interaction between S protein and mammalian ACE2, it was speculated that SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV preserved the ability to infect many mammals including cat, dog, pangolin and Chinese hamster. From the structure stimulation, we identified N82 in ACE2 show closer contact with F486 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared with M82 of ACE2.",

No correlation between genetic distance and the interaction of ACE2/S was found. Some Pets including dog (Canis lupus familiaris) and cat (Felis catus) potentially recognize S protein, indicating the importance to monitor the pets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that four members of Circetidae including Mesocricetus auratus, Phodopus campbelli, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, and Cricetulus griseus remained the key residues for association with S protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, though two members of Muridae (Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus) could not bind to S protein. This founding suggested that Circetidae mammals could be developed as SARSr-CoV small animal models.",

Next, we predicted the structure of cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2 with SARSr-CoV RBD. The structure of protein complex between RBD region of S protein of SARS-CoV and human ACE2 has been resolved (PDB: 2AJF) [7]. Recently, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with human ACE2 was also determined [16,17]. We used Chimera software to display homologous model, and obtained the interaction complex structure of RBD region of SARSr-CoV (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) and cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2. Overall, the RBM structures of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are similar (Fig. 3\n). Interaction interface of SARSr-CoV RBD and cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2 confirmed the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2, indicating that these ACE2 could support SARS-CoV-2 entry. The AA in 82 position of human ACE2 is M82, while the corresponding AA in cat, dog, pangolin and Chinese hamster ACE2 is T82, T81, N82 and N82, respectively. The distance between F486 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the corresponding AA in ACE2 is 3.753\u00c5 for human (Fig. 1A), 2.695\u00c5 for dog (Fig. 3A), 3.753\u00c5 for cat (Fig. 3B), 1.621\u00c5 for pangolin (Fig. 3C), and 2.024\u00c5 for Chinese hamster (Fig. 3D), respectively.

ACE2 contains at least five key amino acids critical for binding S protein of SARSr-CoV [15]. Based on these five amino acids, we analyzed the corresponding amino acids of different mammals to determine which mammalian ACE2 could interact with S protein of human SARSr-CoV. By analyzing the protein sequence of mammalian ACE2, we found that the ACE2 of Camelus dromedarius, Procyon lotor, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, Loxodonta africana, Erinaceus europaeus, Nyctereutes procyonoides, Suricata suricatta, Dipodomys ordii, and Cavia porcellus lose the capability to associate with S protein (Table 1). These mammals could be ruled out from the potential host list for SARS-CoV-2. We found that S protein may bind to ACE2 from some wild mammals, which suggests that we should investigate whether these animals may be intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that the RBM region in S protein of pangolin coronavirus is similar to that of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 [11,12], which may be involved in the recombination of SARS-CoV-2. We identified that N82 of pangolin ACE2 showed closer contact with RBD than human ACE2 (Fig. 3C), indicating that pangolin ACE2 might show better affinity to SARS-CoV-2. This finding further supports the hypothesis that pangolin is involved in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. In current study, only a limited list of wild mammals is covered. In the future, we should select more mammals for study. Although no SARS-CoV-2 has been found in domestic cats and dogs, cat/dog ACE2 may bind to S protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the future, we should pay attention to monitoring whether domestic cats and dogs could be infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

Interestingly, we identified that N82 in ACE2 is closer to RBD than M82 (Fig. 3C and D), indicating a novel strategy to design an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We speculated that small peptide based on N82 of ACE2 might show higher affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We proposed that if M82 in human ACE2 was mutated to N82, the modified human ACE2 will enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the future, those ideas will be tested in cell culture and animal model. We noticed that the ACE2 proteins from Circetidae (Mesocricetus auratus, Phodopus campbelli, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, and Cricetulus griseus) are capable to recognize RBD.
