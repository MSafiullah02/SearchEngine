            "text": "Most of the studies on epidemics so far have focused on the growing phase, such as how an epidemic spreads and what are the conditions for an epidemic to break out in a variety of cases. However, we discover from real data that on a large scale, the spread of an epidemic is in fact a recurrent event with distinctive growing and recovering phases, i.e., a hysteresis loop. We show here that the hysteresis loop can be reproduced in epidemic models provided that the infectious rate is adiabatically increased or decreased before the system reaches its stationary state. Two ways to the hysteresis loop are revealed, which is helpful in understanding the mechanics of infections in real evolution. Moreover, a theoretical analysis is presented to explain the mechanism of the hysteresis loop.",

            "text": "The spreading of epidemics is currently one of the hottest topics in the field of complex networks, and a great deal of significant progress has been achieved so far, including the infinitesimal threshold [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , the reactiondiffusion model [7] [8] [9] [10] , flow-driven epidemics [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , objective spreading [16, 17] , temporal and/or multilayered networks [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , and other aspects [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] ; see Refs. [37] [38] [39] for details. A common point in all these contributions is that their infectious rate \u03b2 remains constant during an evolutionary process, i.e., \u03b2 will not change for the whole evolutionary process from an initial infected seed to the final stationary state. It is well known at present that there is a critical \u03b2 c , although it may be different for different cases. In the thermodynamic limit, the infected fraction will be zero when \u03b2 < \u03b2 c , and it will become nonzero at \u03b2 = \u03b2 c . After the critical point \u03b2 c , the infected fraction will gradually increase with a further increase of \u03b2. Thus, a key question for all these cases is how to determine \u03b2 c . To figure out the answer, a bifurcation diagram of \u03b2 is usually calculated by using the same or similar initial conditions for each \u03b2, i.e., one or a few initial infected seeds. To be specific, for each \u03b2 in the bifurcation diagram we let the system evolve until it attains its stationary state, and then we record the stabilized infectious density [37] . Then, we turn to a new \u03b2 and perform the same process. Thus, the obtained bifurcation diagram of \u03b2 describes how the stabilized infectious density depends on the parameter \u03b2. In this sense, we are concerned with how an epidemic breaks out, i.e., the growing phase where \u03b2 changes from \u03b2 < \u03b2 c to \u03b2 > \u03b2 c .",

This recovering phase is distinctive from the recovery process at the individual level with fixed \u03b2.

We find that (i) the growing and recovering phases do not overlap but take different paths, forming a hysteresis loop (see Fig. 2 as an example), and (ii) there is no jumping behavior in the hysteresis loop, indicating that the hysteresis is not a first-order but rather a second-order transition. To reveal the underlying mechanism of this new hysteresis loop, we present an epidemic model that incorporates two characteristic features of real data. The first one is the influence of seasonal variation. A seasonal epidemic spreading generally lasts for a few months, i.e., beginning from a healthy state, then gradually developing into an outbreak, and finally recovering to the healthy state again. In this process, the weather and environment will undergo an approximately periodic change, implying that \u03b2 will increase accordingly from zero to its maximum \u03b2 e and then decrease to zero again. The second feature is the succession of status during the evolutionary process of epidemic spreading, indicating that the system's parameters are adiabatically changed.",

It has been widely confirmed in recent years that the topology of a network plays an important role in epidemic spreading [37] .

From these we see that each time series consists of a small amplitude background with occasionally large bursts, implying that an epidemic outbreak is unlikely to occur unless some necessary conditions, such as the match of seasonal weather, humidity, and sunlight, are satisfied. We also see from Figs. 1(a)-1(c) that each epidemic outbreak lasts a relatively long time, i.e., from one to a few months, indicating the mark of a season. On the other hand, we have to point out that each time series in Fig. 1 is not from one or a few initial seeds in the same initial stage, rather each time series is a sum from different initial seeds at different initial stages. For example, the data in Fig. 1(a) were collected by the Hong Kong Department of Health from a sentinel surveillance system with 50 general practitioners [46], i.e., a summation of 50 subtime series. In this sense, we conclude that the data reflect in fact the match between epidemic spreading and seasonal environment. A better match implies a better environment for epidemic spreading. That is, we may assume that the degree of match is closely related to the value of \u03b2. Therefore, a burst (or an epidemic outbreak) in Fig. 1 can be modeled by a change of \u03b2 from \u03b2 < \u03b2 c to \u03b2 > \u03b2 c .",

To see this more clearly, we replot one typical burst of Fig. 1 in Fig. 2(a) . With the help of the dashed line, we see that the growing and recovering phases in Fig. 2 (a) are not symmetric.

This is in contrast to most of the previous studies in which the initial conditions for each \u03b2 are always chosen randomly. To reflect the seasonal influence, we may assume that the growing phase corresponds to an adiabatic increase of \u03b2. For the same reason, we may assume that the recovering phase corresponds to an adiabatic decrease of \u03b2. (ii) Each burst usually lasts several weeks or months, indicating the time dependence of \u03b2 on a large scale. This is also in contrast to most of the previous studies, where \u03b2 is allowed to change only after the transient process. A key problem is how \u03b2 depends on the time t. We notice from our observation that we generally have a few continuously sunny or rainy days in a season, indicating that \u03b2 can be approximately considered as a constant in this short period of time, although \u03b2 changes with t on a larger scale. To reflect this feature of real data, we let T be a step change, i.e., \u03b2 will be updated to a new value \u03b2 + \u03b2 once the system has stayed at the current \u03b2 for a time period T , and it can be expressed as",

We have also noticed that in the case of T = 1000, the two curves with down triangles in Fig. 3(a) are overlapping, implying no hysteresis loop. To understand this better, we have calculated the hysteresis area S surrounded by the growing curve \u03c1 g I (\u03b2) and the recovering curve \u03c1 r I (\u03b2), i.e., S = \u03b2 m 0 |\u03c1 r I (\u03b2) \u2212 \u03c1 g I (\u03b2)|d\u03b2, as shown in Fig. 3(b) . It is easy to see that S is approximately zero for T > T s \u2248 100, indicating that the hysteresis loop exists only when T is in the transient process with T < T s . By checking the behaviors of \u03c1 I (t), we find that the system has reached its stationary state after T > T s .

Considering that the hysteresis loop exists in different real data of Fig. 1 , it is necessary to reproduce it in other epidemic models. For this purpose, we take another classical epidemic model, i.e., the SIR model, as an example. To make the SIR model suitable for the case of recurrent epidemics, we extend it to the susceptible-infected-refractory-susceptible (SIRS) model [37] , where an infectious will become a refractory with probability \u03bc, a refractory will recover to susceptible again with probability \u03b4, and the other parts will remain the same as in the SIS model. We let \u03bc = 0.2 and \u03b4 = 0.5, and we perform the same simulations as in the SIS model. We find that there is also a hysteresis loop in this SIRS model.

            "text": "Up to now, the considered growing and recovering phases have been assumed to be separated by the maximum \u03c1 I at \u03b2 m . An interesting question would be whether there is another way to explain the hysteresis loop in Fig. 2(b) . As we mentioned before, \u03b2 may vary from day to day in the real data. Because of the uncertain environment, \u03b2 may not go to \u03b2 m before starting the recovering phase. Once this happens, do we still have the hysteresis loop? To answer this question, we let \u03b2 r be the turning point to separate the growing and recovering phases. That is, we let \u03b2 increase adiabatically from \u03b2 = 0 to \u03b2 r and then we let it decrease adiabatically. We first consider the case of the SIS model. Figure 4 shows the numerical simulations, where (a)-(d) represent the cases of T = 1, 2, 5, and 10, respectively, and the curves with squares, circles, up triangles, and down triangles in each panel represent the cases of \u03b2 r = 0.3, 0.2, 0.15, and 0.1, respectively. From Fig. 4(a) , we see that the case of \u03b2 r = 0.3 is similar to Fig. 3(a) , implying that this \u03b2 r is larger than the \u03b2 m of T = 1. However, the other three cases of Fig. 4(a) belong to the case of \u03b2 r < \u03b2 m , and they have different behaviors from Fig. 3(a) , where their \u03c1 I do not reach the maximum at \u03b2 r but rather during the recovering phase. That is, the recovering phase is not monotonously decreasing but has a bell shape, indicating a delay effect on the appearance of the maximum \u03c1 I . This delay effect can be understood as follows. When \u03b2 is decreased to a value of \u03b2 < \u03b2 r but still satisfies \u03b2 > \u03b2 c , the epidemic will keep growing until \u03b2 \u03b2 c . The delay effect is common in all four panels of Fig. 4 , indicating that it is general for \u03b2 r < \u03b2 m . On the other hand, we notice that the three curves with \u03b2 r = 0.2, 0.15, and 0.1 in Fig. 4(a) keep rising from Fig. 4(b) to Fig. 4(d) and gradually become the normal hysteresis loops. This is because \u03b2 m decreases with the increase of T [see the insets of Figs. 3(b) and 3(d)] and thus \u03b2 r gradually changes from \u03b2 r < \u03b2 m to \u03b2 r > \u03b2 m when T changes from Fig. 4(a) to Fig. 4(d) .",

This dependence of \u03b2(nT ) on time nT is in contrast to previous cases in which \u03b2 is a constant for an evolution. On the other hand, the growing and recovering phases have the same range of varying \u03b2. Do the two phases have the same \u03c1 I when they pass the same value of \u03b2? The answer is no, and the reason is as follows. In the growing phase, \u03c1 I (nT ) is the minimum of \u03c1 I in the segment nT \u2192 (n + 1)T , while in the recovering phase, \u03c1 I (nT ) is the maximum of \u03c1 I in the segment nT \u2192 (n + 1)T . Therefore, the way to choose \u03c1 I (nT ) in Eqs. (4) and (5) leads to asymmetric initial conditions for the two phases of growing and recovering in the segment with the same \u03b2, which is how the memory effect occurs, and this is the direct reason why the hysteresis loop is produced. The down triangles and pentagons in Fig. 7 show the solutions of Eq. (4) with \u03bc = 0.2, k = 6, and T = 1, where the down triangles represent the case of \u03b2 r = 0.4 > \u03b2 m , and the pentagons represent the case of \u03b2 r = 0.15 < \u03b2 m . For comparison, we also plot the corresponding numerical results in Fig. 7 , where the squares and left triangles represent the cases of \u03b2 r = 0.4 > \u03b2 m and \u03b2 r = 0.15 < \u03b2 m , respectively.

In fact, this effective degree theory is quite similar to the approach of improved compartmental formalism [55] in which nodes are categorized not only by their state of infectiousness, but also by the state of their neighbors. We also notice that in Ref. [55] , the approach works quite well for Poisson networks. This causes us to wonder why the effective degree theory does not perform well at predicting the results of the numerical simulations. To figure out the answer, we apply the effective degree theory to the Poisson networks, and surprisingly it also works well. Thus, we conjecture that the gap between the numerical simulations and the analytical approaches in Fig. 7 comes from the adiabatical feature of evolution. Roughly speaking, all of the theoretical approaches, including both the effective degree theory and the approach in Ref. [55] , are based on probability theory, which is good for smooth processes. However, the changing of \u03b2 in an adiabatic way somehow breaks this feature of \"smooth\" and thus results in the small gap between the theories and simulations in Fig. 7 .",

We show that there is a hysteresis loop in real data, and it can be reproduced by incorporating two characteristic features into a general epidemic model, i.e., updating \u03b2 before the system is stabilized and adopting the system's state with its previous \u03b2. Two ways to generate the hysteresis loop are presented: in the first, the growing and recovering phases are separated by a maximum of infected fraction, while in the second, the infected fraction keeps increasing even in the recovering phase. A theoretical analysis shows that the hysteresis loop comes from a memory effect on the adiabatic process with T < T s , which enhances our understanding of real epidemics. ",
