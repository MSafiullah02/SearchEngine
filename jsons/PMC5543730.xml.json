We hypothesized that a viral cause of DAD would be associated with the presence of cytotoxicity-associated cells, which would be not present in the non-viral, non-pulmonary causes of DAD. Since airways and alveoli present site-specific differences in leukocyte trafficking and regulation of inflammations [14], we further reasoned that small airways would present a different profile than that of the parenchyma. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe, quantify and compare the immune cells in the alveolar parenchyma and small airways of patients with viral and non-viral causes of DAD.",

However, there was a significantly higher expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, granzyme A+, and NK cell density in the parenchyma of patients who died from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 DAD, and there was lower cell density of tryptase + mast cells dendritic + cells and an increased number of IL-17+ cells in the airways, compared to non-viral DAD cases and the controls.

Granzymes are a family of five serine proteases present in the granules of cytotoxic cells, which require perforin to exert their cytotoxic activities, inducing apoptosis by different pathways. Granzyme A+ is more abundant, but granzyme B+ has more potent cytotoxic activity [26]. We previously described the presence of granzyme B+ cells in the lungs of these patients [12], but the current quantitative analysis showed that granzyme A+ was actually increased in the parenchyma with strong correlations between granzyme A and CD8+ cells. Harari et al. previously described in humans the blood profiles of CD8 T cells specific to influenza viruses, showing that CD8+ T cells were mostly perforin\u2212, granzyme K+, granzyme A+/\u2212/, and granzyme B\u2212 and that granzyme A was not associated with a cytotoxic profile [27]. Hirota et al. previously described the presence of increased granzyme B+ cells in the lungs of ARDS patients derived from biopsies and autopsies, but the causes of ARDS were not presented in their paper [7]. Whether the observed granzyme A profiles of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases were associated with less potent cytotoxic capacity and, therefore, with increased disease severity deserves further investigation.",

We used CD83 as a marker of mature dendritic cells, but CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T Foxp3+ cells can also express CD83 [28]. Since in this study there were negligible numbers of Foxp3+ cells in the lungs, it is likely that most of the CD83 + cells were mature dendritc cells (DCs). Whereas an increase in CD83+ matureDCs were observed in the parenchyma, SA presented a decrease in CD83+ DCs relative to the controls and a decrease in CD207+ Langerhans DCs relative to the controls and to non-viral DAD. This pattern was previously described in an experimental model of influenza A infection in mice, in which depletion was observed in CD11b + and CD11b2 myeloid DC subsets in the airway mucosa at day 4 of infection, returning to baseline by day 14 post-infection [29]. In the parenchyma, DCs were significantly elevated at day 14 and remained so until day 21 post-infection. Because airway DCs tend to have first contact with aeroallergens, it has been speculated that this early decrease is due to enhanced migration to draining LNs or apoptosis. Parenchymal DCs in the alveolar walls would represent a distinct microenvironment, which would be important in the later phases of infection, regulating T cell immunity [30]. To our knowledge, this study was the first to show a similar pattern in human tissue.",

Mast cells are important cells in the surveillance of infection, and H1N1 virus can infect mast cells, stimulating the release of cytokines and chemokines [31]. In contrast, Liu et al. showed that H1N1 virus induced mast cell apoptosis, which could explain our findings [32]. In non-viral DAD, the reasons for the decreased mast cell density in the airways are not clear. Interestingly, no changes at the parenchymal level were observed in any of the groups. These results could be explained by our cases being mostly exudative or early proliferative cases. Liebler et al. previously analysed ARDS cases in different histological stages, reporting that mast cells were increased only at a later fibroproliferative stage, and they suggested that these cells were not implicated in fibrogenesis [33].",

Increased levels of IL-17 in the lungs are believed to be an early indicator of disease severity in H1N1 virus infection [34\u201336]. We found increased levels of IL-17 in both groups but surprisingly only at the small airway level, showing significant correlations with neutrophil and macrophage cell densities in ARDS group. Our finding reinforced the contribution of bronchioles to the pathogenesis of acute interstitial diseases by secreting cytokines, and inflammatory mediators involved in the early phases of acute lung injury [21, 22].",

Due to its retrospective character, we had limited access to clinical and ventilatory data at the time of death, especially from the A(H1N1)pdm09 cases, because some of the patients presented with very severe disease and died within a few days in other institutions [12], and they were referred to our service for autopsy. We were not able to include a group of patients with non-viral and pulmonary ARDS, given the heterogeneity of this group (bacterial, fungi, lung cancer, immunosuppression, etc), that would make interpretation of data difficult. Therefore, we cannot conclude about the specificity of the immune response in H1N1 cases. Furthermore, we analysed lung tissue from patients who developed severe disease, which might have presented differently in less severe cases of DAD and could explain the lack of significant clinical-morphological correlations. In both DAD groups we had cases with secondary bacterial infection, which might have influenced the results. Nevertheless, we were able to identify a cytotoxic profile compatible with viral infection in H1N1 cases.",

Both DAD groups had increased numbers of neutrophils and macrophages, but the H1N1 group had a cellular cytotoxic profile at the parenchymal level, with a divergent pattern of dendritic and mast cell depletion at the small airway level. Other immune cell alterations were present only at the small airway level in non-viral DAD cases, reinforcing the role of small airways in the pathogenesis of exudative ARDS.
