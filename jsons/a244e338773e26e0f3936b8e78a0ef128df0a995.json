In order to avoid the high risks involved in handling SARS-CoV and to facilitate the study of viral fusion mechanism, we established the cell lines: SR-COS7 cells that stably express both SARS-CoV S protein and red fluorescence protein, R-COS7 cells that stably express red fluorescence protein, and AG-COS7 cells that stably express both ACE2 and green fluorescence protein, respectively. When SR-COS7 cells or R-COS7 cells were cocultured with AG-COS7 cells, syncytia with yellow fluorescence were conveniently observed after 12 h in SR-COS7 cells plus AG-COS7 cells, but not in R-COS7 cells plus AG-COS7 cells. The cell-to-cell fusion efficiency was simply determined for quantitative analysis based on the number of syncytium detected by flow cytometry. Such new cell-to-cell fusion model was further assessed by the potent HR2 peptide inhibitor, which led to the obvious decrease of the cell-to-cell fusion efficiency. The successful fusion and inhibition of cell-based binding assay shows that it can be well used for the study of SARS-CoV entry and inhibition.",

            "text": "Nowadays, the study of SARS-CoV infection mainly focuses on elucidating the fusion mechanism and developing the fusion inhibitors. During the viral entry process, spike (S) protein on the virion surface is involved in receptor binding and membrane fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Although S protein of SARS-CoV does not appear to be cleaved into two segments, it still contains S1 and S2 functional domains. The S1 bears the receptor attachment site of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (9, 10) , and the S2 has the fusion activity through forming a trimer-ofhairpins structure (11, 12) . The special structure and function of S protein are applied to screen potential fusion inhibitors through inhibiting formation of trimer-of-hairpin (4, 6) . In the study of viral entry and inhibition, viral infectivity assay is usually necessary. For the high contagious viruses, especially for SARS-CoV that was strictly used in routine research in some countries and regions, cell-to-cell fusion model is needed to reduce the usage of live virus. Usually, the cell-to-cell fusion assay can reconstitute interaction between viral glycoprotein and its cellular receptor. Now such cell-to-cell fusion model is widely used in the field of HIV-1 for the interaction between gp120 and gp41 (13), structure-function relationship of gp41, steric accessibility of the HIV-gp41 N-trimer region (14) , and screen of potential inhibitors (15, 16) . Considering seriously restrictive usage of SARS-CoV and benefits of cell fusion assay, a convenient and safe cell-to-cell fusion assay is greatly needed for the study of SARS-CoV entry inhibitors.",

One is cell-to-cell fusion between the Vero E6 cells, a SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) expressing cell-line, and the transfected cells expressing EGFPfused S protein (17) , and the other is luciferase activity-based cell-to-cell fusion assay (18, 19) . These cell-to-cell fusion models were used for studying viral entry and inhibition, but their cell-binding approaches were not visualized enough. In this work, we tried to develop a safe and convenient cell-to-cell fusion assay for the study of SARS-CoV entry and inhibition. One pool of COS7 cells stably expresses both SARS-CoV S protein and red fluorescence protein, and another pool of COS7 cells stably expresses both ACE2 and green fluorescence protein, respectively. The cell-to-cell fusion process is conveniently monitored according to the formation of syncytia with yellow fluorescence, and the fusion efficiency is simply detected by flow cytometry. Therefore, such fusion assay can be well used for the study of SARS-CoV fusion mechanism and the identification of potential inhibitors.",

The fragment was cloned into pCMV-Tag2B vector (Clontech, USA) to generate the plasmid pS. The plasmid ACE2-pCDNA3.1(7) was kindly provided by Dr GengFu Xiao (State Key Laboratory of Virology, China). The ACE2 gene was amplified by PCR from the plasmid ACE2-pCDNA3.1(7) and cloned into pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech, USA) to generate pAG. The pIRES2-EGFP vector contains the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV) and can be used to express EGFP alone or obtain stably transfected cell lines without time-consuming clonal selection. In this paper, the second heptad repeat region (HR2) region of SARS-CoV S protein covers amino acids 1149-1186 of S protein. The DNA fragment corresponding to the HR2 with 5 additional amino acid residues DDDDK (Enterokinase cleavage site) at the N-terminal was constructed by overlapping PCR and cloned into the BamHI-XhoI restriction enzyme sites of the GST fusion expression vector pGEX-6p-1 (Pharmacia, Sweden). DNA sequencing confirmed that these recombined vectors were constructed successfully.",

Briefly, cells were grown in Luria Broth (LB) containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin at 378C. When the culture density (OD 600 ) reached 0.6, the culture was induced with 0.2 mM Isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and grown for an additional 4 h at 288C. The harvested culture was centrifuged and the bacterial cell pellet was re-suspended in lysis Buffer (1% Triton X-100, PBS, pH 7.3) and homogenized by sonication. The lysate was subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 48C. Then the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The protein-loaded column was then washed with PBS. After that, the GST-fusion protein, GST-HR2, was eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione. For the GSTremoved protein HR2, the enterokinase was added into the resin to cleave the GST, and the HR2 was eluted. GST-HR2 and HR2 were concentrated by freeze-drying and were desalted with molecular sieve. Proteins were analyzed on 10% Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE or 12% SDS-PAGE.",

As for HIV-1, both cell-to-cell fusion and viral infection assays are widely used in the field of fusion mechanism and screening of potential inhibitors (14, 16, 20) . Considering seriously restrictive usage of SARS-CoV strain and benefits of cell-to-cell fusion assay, we tried to develop a convenient cell-to-cell fusion assay in this work. The fusion process was conducted between SR-COS7 cells with red fluorescence protein and AG-COS7 cells with green fluorescence protein, which successfully confirmed the function of viral S protein mediating membrane fusion between virus and host cell. In this work, flow cytometry was applied to determine cell-to-cell fusion efficiency based on its characteristic that can easily count the number of SR-COS7 cell, AG-COS7 cell and syncytium according to the fluorescence in cell, respectively. Compared with cell-to-cell fusion assay of SARS-CoV between Vero E6 cells (a SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 expressing cell line) and transfected cells expressing EGFP-tagged S protein (17), the obvious advantage was that this cell-to-cell fusion process was considerably convenient to be monitored according to the yellow fluorescence of syncytia. Simultaneously, lack of quantitative analysis for cell-to-cell fusion efficiency (17) was also overcome in our cell-tocell fusion assay. In this work, quantitative analysis of cellto-cell fusion was simply realized by counting the number of syncytium with flow cytometry. Perhaps, the actual cell-to-cell fusion efficiency might be higher than the results from flow cytometry because fused syncytia were fractured more easily than the single cell during the course of trypsinzation. The quantitative analysis of cell-to-cell fusion based on the luciferase activity was used for functional research of S protein (19, 21) and potential inhibitor identification (4, 7, 18) . Compared with this cell-to-cell fusion assay, the luciferase activity-based cell-to-cell fusion assay was not visualized enough, and it was difficult to directly determine how many cells were fused in the cell-to-cell fusion assay. In addition, the successful inhibition of cell-to-cell fusion blocked by HR2 peptide not only showed that there were interaction between S protein and ACE2 but also confirmed that the mechanism of trimer-of-hairpins structure (11, 12) was adopted during this cell-to-cell fusion process.",

In contrast, influenza virus utilizes a pH-dependent endocytotic pathway. As for SARS-CoV entry, the effect of pH seems unclear until now. The pH-dependent fusion mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein was ever found, and addition of ammonium chloride was helpful for SARS-CoV entry (18, 22) . However, the neutral pH was then found necessary for cell-to-cell fusion (3). In our work, the effect of different pH values ranging from pH 5.0 to pH 8.5 on cell-to-cell fusion was investigated, and it was found that neutral pH is much beneficial to cell-to-cell fusion. Such results further confirmed that the interaction between S protein expressing cells and ACE2 expressing cells could well induce cell membrane fusion at neutral pH.",

One of the advantages of the IRESmediated polycistronic expression vector is to eliminate redundant control regions such as internal promoters and terminators, and thus reduce plasmid size and facilitate efficient transfection. Moreover, functional studies showed that simultaneous expression of SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and fluorescence protein could provide more creditable results to detect the process of SARS-CoV entry and inhibition than that of EGFP-fused ACE2.",

Some studies also reported that there were average 10 syncytia per well in 96-well plates (3). During our cell-to-cell fusion assay, although the fusion efficiency increased, about 10% syncytia detected by flow cytometry was not enough. Therefore, how to further improve the cell-to-cell fusion efficiency is our future focus. At present, the improved cell-to-cell fusion assay is much useful to study SARS-CoV fusion mechanism and screen potential inhibitors.",
