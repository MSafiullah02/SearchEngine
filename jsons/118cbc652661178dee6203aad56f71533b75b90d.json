Given the significant overlap between the core tenets of TIC and accepted guidelines for the provision of quality palliative care (PC), PC teams are particularly well poised to both incorporate such practices into routine care and to argue for their integration across health systems. We outline this intersection in order to highlight the uniquely powerful role PC teams can play to reduce the long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Additional sources of psychological distress and threat to wellbeing for patients, caregivers, and providers may include isolation, illness stigmatization, and concern for spreading the threat of COVID-19 to others. 4 Following the immediate damage of COVID-19, we expect an increasing wave of trauma response from patients, caregivers, and providers alike. 4 ( Figure  1 ).",

At the patient and caregiver level, the guidelines recommend \"developing a care plan that reflects patient and family culture, values, strengths, goals, and preferences,\" and stress that \"if historical trauma was assessed, the treatment plan adopts a trauma-informed approach to develop trust.\" At the healthcare team and organizational levels, clinicians and teams should \"work to increase awareness of their own biases and seek opportunities to learn about the provision of culturally sensitive care.\" PC teams should \"regularly evaluate and, if needed, modify services, policies, and procedures to maximize cultural sensitivity and reduce disparities in care.\" 7",
