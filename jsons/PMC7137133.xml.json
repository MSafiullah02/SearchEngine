King's results should trigger a better quantification of the development impact of schistosomiasis. Beyond this, their analysis should encourage a comprehensive re-evaluation of the burden on human and economic development of a group of highly prevalent but still concealed communicable diseases of the poor, including soil-transmitted helminthiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, food-borne trematode infections, and trachoma.",

The second concern is the potential limitation of a chemotherapy-based strategy should drug resistance arise. We therefore believe that appropriate tools need to be developed and mechanisms put in place to enable monitoring of any reduction in drug efficacy so that strategic changes can be made in a timely manner.13 We also believe that research for new drugs and new control tools, such as the possible development of a hookworm vaccine, should be pursued.14\n",
