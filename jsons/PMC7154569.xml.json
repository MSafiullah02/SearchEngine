Based on these considerations and although delays in surgical treatment beyond 2\u20133 months result in a higher recurrence rate [16], there have been recommendations by societies and experts to delay surgical treatment for stage I and stage II colorectal cancer for up to 6 months [17]. Moreover, neoadjuvant treatments have been recommended for high-risk colon and rectal cancer to defer as long as possible surgical admission [18] with the use of preoperative chemotherapy for colon cancer [17] or of consolidation chemotherapy after either chemoradiation or short-course radiotherapy for rectal cancer [19, 20].",

            "text": "However, while temporizing strategies may be useful in case of extreme scarcity of heath care resources or in cases of serious threats to patient safety, the experience which we have matured, especially in northern Italy during the last 2 months, leads us to the following considerations for COVID-19-negative patients with colorectal cancer:We do not know when things will go back to normal. We cannot postpone surgical treatment under the assumption that the risk of hospitalization will be lower in the near future. Moreover, none of the proposed neoadjuvant treatments have been shown to be superior to the more traditional approach and all involve prolonged chemotherapy that will further impair the patient\u2019s immune system increasing the risk of COVID-19 complications.Hopefully, elective cancer care can be provided in selected and approved COVID-19-free hospitals. In this ideal situation, all patients should be screened 24\u201348 h prior to admission with a chest CT scan and the available rapid turnaround RT-PCR test. All hospital personnel in COVID-19-free hospitals should also be screened by checking their temperature at the hospital entrance and repeated sputum or nasal swab testing, since, for such a system to work, it is necessary to reduce the risk of contamination both from within and from without. Alternatively, if the implementation of COVID-19-free hospitals is unfeasible, elective cancer care surgery may be offered by hospitals where COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients are located in clearly separate areas which include wards, operating rooms, ICUs, radiology and endoscopy units, and personnel to reduce to a minimum the risk of infection.In general, oncologic protocols should be applied following the current guidelines. Among these protocols and whenever supported by the literature, treatment should be minimized. For locally advanced rectal cancer, several recommendations are available and supported by national and international guidelines. However, within this heterogeneous group of rectal cancer patients, there are subgroups with different risks of recurrence and prognosis (\u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d). Within the context of a pandemic COVID-19 infection, it is reasonable to recommend less aggressive approaches for less aggressive cancers. For example, on approaching rectal cancer determined by clinical staging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to be T3a-b N0 (The Good), upfront total mesorectal excision could be the best treatment as the benefits of chemoradiation therapy followed by total mesorectal excision in this group of patients are questionable. Again, aggressive neoadjuvant therapies with induction or consolidation chemotherapy should be reserved for cancers with the highest risk of recurrence (The Ugly) such as those with infiltration of the mesorectal fascia or clearly positive nodes in the mesorectum or pelvic extramesorectal lymph-node metastasis. Whenever possible, neoadjuvant short-course radiotherapy should be preferred to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy should be restricted to the cases where the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, especially elderly patients. Exclusion or delayed surgery should be recommended in those very exceptional situations where anesthesiologists or operating rooms are unavailable, because they are being used to face the pandemic. All these decisions should be made by a multidisciplinary oncology team and fully discussed with patients.As far as the surgical approach for colorectal cancer, the following considerations apply:",

For example: stents should be preferred to palliative resections. When evaluating different surgical options, the rate and severity of postoperative complications should be considered. For example: in patients with low rectal cancer and serious comorbidities with or without prior radiation, Hartmann\u2019s procedure may be preferred to the standard reconstruction which is at high risk for anastomotic leak and likely will require a long recovery period and ICU admission.

However, as these approaches are not standard of care, it seems reasonable to enter patients into prospective studies where conservative approaches are evaluated [21]. Conversely, we discourage rectum-sparing approaches outside of research protocols.",

In COVID-19-negative patients, elective surgery should be performed following the current guidelines, using the least aggressive treatment possible and providing treatments in COVID-19-free hospitals (hopefully) or in hospitals where COVID-19-positive and -negative patients follow clearly separate pathways. In COVID-19-positive patients, recovery from the infection is the priority and cancer surgery should be reserved only for life-threatening situations. In both COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative cancer patients with an emergent presentation, the treatment should be as conservative as possible, avoiding surgery if feasible, using stent placement for stenosing cancer as bridge to surgery or as palliative treatment. Hartmann\u2019s procedure should be considered instead of a low colorectal or coloanal anastomosis, or in presence of left-sided occlusion or perforation. Ostomies should be strongly considered.",

The risk of aerosol exposure and subsequent infection for the surgical team during a minimally invasive procedure is a potential issue [22] which has led scientific societies to recommend performing open surgery in COVID-19-positive patients [4]. However, the potential hazards of laparoscopy (including robotic surgery) need to be weighed against the benefits of a shorter length of stay and decreased complication rate. Laparoscopic surgery in COVID-19-positive patients should be performed in a negative pressure room if available, and an ultra-filtration (smoke evacuation system or filtration) should be used, if available. All pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated via a filtration system before closure, trocar removal, specimen extraction, or conversion to open [6]. Moreover, appropriate trocar-size incisions to avoid air leaks are strongly recommended and the use of cautery should be minimized to decrease smoke concentration.",
