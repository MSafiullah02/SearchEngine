Coronaviruses in group II infect mice, rats, cattle or humans, as well as several other host species. Only one cellular glycoprotein has been identified as a receptor for a group II coronavirus. The murine coronavirus [murine hepatitis virus (MHV)] utilizes as receptors murine carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) and related murine glycoproteins in the CEA family of glycoproteins in the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily (Dveksler et al., 1993a, Dveksler et al., 1993b, Yokomori and Lai, 1992). The envelope of most group II coronaviruses contains a hemagglutinin esterase (HE) glycoprotein that binds to 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acid, but the A59 strain of MHV (MHV-A59) does not express HE (Yokomori et al., 1991). Thus, MHV-A59 infection of susceptible mice and murine cell lines depends solely on interactions of the viral spike glycoprotein (S) with mCEACAM1a and related murine glycoproteins (Hemmila et al., 2004).",

The interaction of the viral spike glycoprotein with a specific cellular glycoprotein receptor is a major determinant of coronavirus host range. Cell lines from host species that are normally resistant to MHV, porcine coronavirus [transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)] or human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E) are rendered susceptible to infection by transfection with cDNA encoding the specific coronavirus receptors mCEACAM1a, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) or human APN (hAPN), respectively (Delmas et al., 1992, Dveksler et al., 1991, Yeager et al., 1992). The 180-kDa S of MHV is a type I viral fusion protein that mediates both receptor binding and membrane fusion activities (Bosch et al., 2003, Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). S of MHV-A59 is post-translationally cleaved by a cellular protease into 90 kDa S1 and S2 proteins that remain non-covalently associated on the viral envelope. Variations in the amino acid (aa) sequence of S1 of MHV strains are associated with differences in tissue tropism and pathogenesis (Leparc-Goffart et al., 1998, Phillips et al., 2001). The membrane-anchored S2 contains a coiled-coil domain that is likely associated with membrane fusion and is more highly conserved among MHV strains than S1 (Bosch et al., 2003).",

Binding of the N-terminal domain of soluble mCEACAM1a to S1 on MHV virions at 37 \u00b0C induces conformational changes in S1 and S2 proteins, and neutralizes virus (Gallagher, 1997, Lewicki and Gallagher, 2002, Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002, Miura et al., 2004, Zelus et al., 1998). Incubation of purified MHV-A59 virions with soluble mCEACAM1a at neutral pH, or without receptor at pH 8.0, triggers major conformational changes in S2 (Zelus et al., 2003). These conformational changes may expose a hydrophobic domain in S that allows virus to bind liposomes and presumably initiates fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes, as well as cell-to-cell fusion. Mutational analyses of determinants in mCEACAM1a that alter MHV binding and entry implicated residues in the predicted CC\u2032 loop and the C\u2032 \u03b2 sheet in the N-terminal domain of mCEACAM1a (Rao et al., 1997, Wessner et al., 1998). The predicted CC\u2032 loop was also shown by mutational analyses to be critical for recognition of human CEACAM1 by bacterial pathogens such as Neisseria, as well as for homophilic cell adhesion (Bos et al., 1999, Virji et al., 1999, Watt et al., 2001). The crystal structure of mCEACAM1a[1,4] showed that the CC\u2032 loop has a convoluted conformation unlike other Ig superfamily glycoproteins (Tan et al., 2002). The side chain of an isoleucine at residue 41 (I41) projects upwards away from the membrane and was predicted to play an important role in mCEACAM1a recognition by MHV S proteins.",

Domains of S that are responsible for receptor binding have been identified for several coronaviruses. Aa 417\u2013547 of S of HCoV-229E comprise a minimal receptor binding domain (RBD) for hAPN expressed on cell membranes (Bonavia et al., 2003, Breslin et al., 2003), while aa 1\u2013330 of S of MHV (S330) comprise the minimal domain for binding to soluble mCEACAM1a in vitro and initiating infection via anchored mCEACAM1a (Kubo et al., 1994, Tsai et al., 2003). Aa 318\u2013510 of S of SARS-CoV comprise a minimal domain for binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in vitro (Babcock et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003, Wong et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2003). Recently, we demonstrated that the N-terminal region of S1 containing 21 aa substitutions and a 7-aa insert derived from MHV/BHK, a virus variant generated during persistent MHV-A59 infection of murine cells, is sufficient to extend the host range of MHV-A59 in vitro (Sawicki et al., 1995, Schickli et al., 1997, Schickli et al., 2004, Thackray and Holmes, 2004). Residues critical for receptor utilization and host specificity have not been identified for most coronaviruses, although several residues that play a role in the interactions of the MHV S protein with mCEACAM1a or of the SARS-CoV S protein with ACE2 have been identified (Saeki et al., 1997, Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996, Wong et al., 2004). With the emergence of SARS-CoV in humans and the search for effective drug-based interventions for coronavirus infection, the need to identify residues critical for the interactions of coronaviruses with their cellular receptors is greater than ever.",

To examine the roles of these residues in the receptor specificity of S, we used targeted RNA recombination (TRR) to generate isogenic viruses that differ from MHV-A59 at one or two aa in the RBD of S. We showed that Y162 is critical for the recovery of MHV-A59 from cells expressing mCEACAM1a.

We identified four residues, S33, T82, Y162 and K183, that are conserved in S330 of all MHV strains, but not in the corresponding domains of rat, bovine and human coronaviruses in group II (Fig. 1A). Another residue, L79, is conserved in S330 of all MHV strains, except MHV 2, but not in S330 of rat, bovine or human group II coronaviruses. These five residues are also conserved in the extended host range variant MHV/BHK that infects a wide range of non-murine cell lines while maintaining the ability to infect murine cells (Schickli et al., 2004, Thackray and Holmes, 2004). To examine the roles of these residues in the receptor specificity of S, we used TRR to introduce single aa substitutions at S33, Y162 or K183 and double aa substitutions at L79 and T82 into the genome of MHV-A59. The aa substitutions were chosen to reflect residues found in rat, bovine or human group II coronaviruses, a conservative Y to F substitution, or neutral alanine substitutions (Fig. 1A). Although aa substitutions at T62 or L65 in S330 of MHV-JHM were previously associated with reduced mCEACAM1a binding (Saeki et al., 1997, Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996), we observed that T62 and L65 were conserved in S330 of all MHV strains, as well as S330 of related rat, bovine and human coronaviruses (Fig. 1A). To examine the roles of these residues in the receptor specificity of S in the context of infectious isogenic viruses, we used targeted RNA recombination (TRR) to introduce aa substitutions at T62 or L65 into the genome of MHV-A59. The aa substitutions were chosen to reflect substitutions made previously, S and H for T62 and L65, respectively, (Saeki et al., 1997, Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996) or neutral alanine substitutions.",

Aa substitutions were selected by identification of five residues, S33, L79, T82, Y162 and K183, that are highly conserved in S330 of seven MHV strains and the extended host range variant MHV/BHK, but not in S330 of related group II coronaviruses of rats, cattle and humans.

Fcwf cells inoculated with fMHV and transfected with pMH54-EGFP or pMH54-EGFP RNAs encoding Y162H, Y162Q, Y162A or Y162F substitutions showed limited EGFP expression when plated alone (data not shown). However, fMHV-inoculated Fcwf cells transfected with pMH54-EGFP or pMH54-EGFP RNAs encoding Y162H, Y162Q, Y162A or Y162F substitutions that were overlaid onto 17 Cl 1 or BHK + mCEACAM1a(I41R) cell monolayers showed increased CPE and EGFP expression (Fig. 2). These data strongly suggested that the majority of CPE and EGFP expression observed was due to infection of 17 Cl 1 or BHK + mCEACAM1a cells. Recombinant viruses with Y162H and Y162Q substitutions inefficiently infected 17 Cl 1 and BHK + mCEACAM1a(I41R) cell monolayers (Fig. 2) and these viruses were not recovered from either 17 Cl 1 or BHK + mCEACAM1a(I41R) cells (Table 1). Although viruses with Y162A substitutions were recovered from 17 Cl 1 and BHK + mCEACAM1a(I41R) cells, the Y162A viruses formed minute plaques on 17 Cl 1 cell monolayers (Fig. 3) and had markedly lower yields than MHV-A59. In contrast, F substitutions for Y162 were well tolerated by the S proteins of MHV-A59, since the Y162F viruses infected both 17 Cl 1 and mCEACAM1a(I41R) cells as well as MHV-A59 (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 6). These data suggest that the phenyl ring of Y162 may form an essential hydrophobic contact with the MHV-binding domain of mCEACAM1a, and that this hydrophobic contact is disrupted in S proteins with H, Q or A substitutions at Y162. Alternatively, it is possible that H, Q or A substitutions at Y162 may alter the local conformation or stability of S proteins, since a S310G substitution in the S of MHV-JHM is associated with decreased S1\u2013S2 stability (Ontiveros et al., 2003) and a Q294L substitution in the S of infectious bronchitis virus has been shown to inhibit maturation and incorporation of S proteins into virions (Shen et al., 2004). Additional studies will be needed to determine whether Y162 participates directly in mCEACAM1a binding, triggers the fusion activity of S and/or maintains the conformation of the RBD of the MHV S protein.",

The S33R, S33G, L79M/T82M, K183R and K183G viruses were neutralized like MHV-A59 by soluble mCEACAM1a at neutral pH and 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 5). In addition, just like MHV-A59, the S33R, S33G, L79M/T82M, L79A/T82A, K183R and K183G viruses bound mCEACAM1a using an epitope that overlaps that of the blocking anti-mCEACAM1a MAb-CC1 (Fig. 6). The recovery, growth and plaque phenotypes shared by each independently generated replicate of each mutant virus strongly suggests that the engineered mutations in S330, rather than adventitious mutations outside of the S gene, were responsible for the observed phenotypes of these viruses.",

During TRR, feline Fcwf cells infected with fMHV and transfected with mutant MHV-A59 RNAs may generate virions whose envelopes contain both chimeric fMHV S proteins and mutant MHV-A59 S proteins due to phenotypic mixing. The phenotypically heterogeneous S33G, L79M/T82M and K183G virions may have impaired interactions with mCEACAM1a. However, phenotypically homogenous S33G, L79M/T82M and K183G virions, generated in BHK + mCEACAM1a cells, may regain the ability to interact with mCEACAM1a on 17 Cl 1 cells. Alternatively, the high level of receptor expression on BHK + mCEACAM1a(I41R) cells may facilitate the recovery of these crippled viruses by increasing the number of receptors available on cell membranes. In a similar manner, increased expression of its cellular receptor partially restores the infectivity of a Friend murine leukemia virus with aa substitutions in its receptor binding pocket (Davey et al., 1999). In addition, the I41R substitution in the N-terminal domain of mCEACAM1a may facilitate the recovery of crippled viruses with mutant S proteins.",

A single T62S substitution or a triple T212S, Y214S, Y216S substitution in soluble S330 of MHV-JHM reduced binding to soluble mCEACAM1a in vitro (Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996). Soluble receptor resistant (srr) mutants of MHV-JHM with L65H substitutions in S330 also had reduced binding to soluble mCEACAM1a in vitro (Saeki et al., 1997). However, these srr mutants had wild-type interactions with anchored mCEACAM1a expressed in hamster cells (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2000). In this study, we found that isogenic recombinant MHV-A59 viruses with T62S, T62A, L65H or L65A substitutions had wild-type growth in 17 Cl 1 cells and were neutralized, like MHV-A59, by soluble mCEACAM1a at neutral pH and 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The T62S and T62A viruses formed turbid plaques on 17 Cl 1 cell monolayers, while the L65H and L65A viruses formed opaque plaques (Fig. 4). Thus, although T62 and L65 are not essential for mCEACAM1a utilization by MHV-A59, these residues may nevertheless influence spike-receptor interactions (Rao and Gallagher, 1998). We noted that T62 and L65 are conserved in S330 of murine, rat, bovine and human coronaviruses in group II (Fig. 1A). Since MHV-A59 does not bind rat, bovine or human tissues or infect rat, bovine or human cell lines (Compton et al., 1992), T62 and L65, individually, most likely do not determine the receptor specificity of MHV.",

Like wild type MHV-A59, infection of murine cells by viruses with substitutions at S33, T62, L65, L79/T82, Y162 or K183 was blocked by anti-mCEACAM1a MAb-CC1 (Fig. 6). None of the viruses with substitutions at S33, T62, L65, L79/T82, Y162 or K183 infected rat, hamster or human cell lines. Perhaps multiple aa substitutions are needed to change the host range of MHV-A59. We recently showed that 21 aa substitutions and a 7-aa insert in the N-terminal region of S1 of MHV-A59 are sufficient to extend the viral host range (Schickli et al., 2004, Thackray and Holmes, 2004). Isogenic recombinant viruses that differ from MHV-A59 by the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert in S not only utilize mCEACAM1a, but also as yet unidentified receptors on murine and non-murine cells (Thackray and Holmes, 2004). Alternatively, residues in the S proteins of rat, bovine and human coronaviruses in group II critical for receptor binding may not be found in S330. An aspartic acid at residue 454 in the RBD of the distantly related SARS-CoV S protein is essential for binding to ACE2 in vitro (Wong et al., 2004).",

We postulate that Y162 may comprise part of a hydrophobic pocket or patch in the RBD of S that interacts with hydrophobic residues in the MHV-binding site of mCEACAM1a. Hydrophobic residues such as Y, F and W are known to play important roles in spike-receptor interactions of other enveloped viruses such as herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus and murine retroviruses (Carfi et al., 2001, Connolly et al., 2003, Kwong et al., 1998, Wu et al., 1996, Zhang et al., 2003). Residues S33, T62, L65, L79, T82 and K183 are most likely located peripheral to this hydrophobic binding site, since binding hot spots in spike-receptor interactions are often surrounded by energetically less critical residues, predominantly charged in nature (Bogan and Thorn, 1998, Wang, 2002). Residues that extend the host range of MHV-A59 may also be located peripheral to the hydrophobic binding site. During persistent MHV infection in murine cells, the important mCEACAM1a binding residues in S are retained (Baric et al., 1999, Schickli et al., 1997), while additional aa substitutions may be selected that enhance the affinity or avidity of S for mCEACAM1a and allow MHV to utilize as yet unidentified alternative receptors on murine and non-murine cells.",
