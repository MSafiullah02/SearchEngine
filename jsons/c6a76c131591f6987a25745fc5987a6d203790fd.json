Rather, the examination for splenomegaly is most useful to rule in the diagnosis of splenomegaly among patients in whom there is a clinical suspicion of at least 10%. The examination should always start with percussion. If no dullness is detected on percussion, there is no need to palpate as the results of palpation will not effectively rule in or rule out splenic enlargement. If the possibility of missing splenic enlargement remains an important clinical concern, then ultrasound or scintigraphy is indicated. In the presence of percussion dullness, palpation should follow. If both tests are positive, the diagnosis of splenomegaly is established (providing the clinical suspicion of splenomegaly was at least 10% before examination).

Need to confirm eradication of H. pylori. Follow closely with gastroscopy. If MALT persists for over 8-12 months, should consider single-agent chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil) or involvedfield radiation. Partial gastrectomy may be needed for hemorrhage or perforation ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LYMPHOMA PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-continuum of presentation with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Sezary syndrome is a variant of mycosis fungoides with a triad of erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and leukemia CLINICAL FEATURES-localized patches or plaques evolving into nodules and diffuse exfoliative erythroderma associated with abnormal circulating cells.

Urinary Bence Jones protein (urine protein electrophoresis) is required to detect paraproteinemia; nonsecretatory myeloma (3%) requires bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC ISSUES INTERNATIONAL MYELOMA WORKING GROUP CRITERIA MULTIPLE MYELOMA BONE MARROW PLASMA CELLS/PLASMACYTOMAno percent specified, but usually >10% M-PROTEIN-in serum and/or urine, no concentration specified, but >30 g/L [>3 g/dL] in serum if overt myeloma TISSUE IMPAIRMENT-wCRABw increased calcium (>2.75 mmol/L [>11 mg/dL]), renal insufficiency (Cr >173 mmol/L [>1.9 mg/dL]), anemia (Hb <100 g/L [ <10 g/dL] or drop by 20 g/L [2 g/dL]), bone lesions (lytic lesions, fractures). Other features include hyperviscosity, amyloidosis, or recurrent infections (>2 episodes in 12 months) SMOLDERING MULTIPLE MYELOMA (SMM) BONE MARROW PLASMA CELLS->10% M-PROTEIN->30 g/L [>3 g/dL] (but not necessary if bone marrow plasma cells>10%) TISSUE IMPAIRMENT-no symptoms MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY OF UNDETERMINED SIGNIF-ICANCE (MGUS) BONE MARROW PLASMA CELLS-<10% (bone marrow biopsy is not required for suspected MGUS if M-protein 15 g/L [ 1.5 g/dL], IgG subtype, and patient asymptomatic) M-PROTEIN-< 30 g/L[ <3g/dL] TISSUE IMPAIRMENT-no symptoms COURSE-occurs in 2% of population over age 50 and 3% over age 70. Rate of transformation to malignant plasma cell disorder (multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, primary amyloidosis, B-cell lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia) is about 1% per year NEJM 2006 355:26 DIAGNOSTIC CLUES SYMPTOMS-the presence of tissue impairment suggests either multiple myeloma (usually high M-protein) or amyloidosis (usually low M-protein). AL amyloidosis is characterized by insoluble, toxic amyloid precursor (light chains) aggregates that deposit in tissues in antiparallel b-pleated sheet configuration. The absence of symptoms suggests MGUS or SMM QUANTITATIVE IG-typically decreased serum levels of normal polyclonal immunoglobulins in multiple myeloma. However, this may also occur in MGUS BENCE JONES PROTEINURIA-the presence of monoclonal light chains (especially >1 g/day) in the urine suggests multiple myeloma. However, small amounts ( <50 mg/day) may also occur in MGUS SERUM M PROTEIN LEVEL-the higher the level, the higher the likelihood of multiple myeloma. Some define 35 g/L [3.5 g/dL] for IgG and 20 g/L [2 g/dL] for IgA as cutoff, others define 30 g/L [3 g/dL] regardless of Ig subtype as cutoff TERMINOLOGIES (CONT'D) DONOR SOURCE-peripheral blood (10-20 L of blood, mobilization with GCSF, venipuncture, leukapheresis (up to 3 times for autologous stem cell transplant), faster engraftment, and improved overall survival (for autologous stem cell transplant and matched sibling allogeneic transplant), bone marrow, umbilical cord blood (unlimited supply of donors, although limited amount of cord blood. More tolerant for mismatches in allogeneic transplant) DECIDING BETWEEN ALLOGENEIC AND AUTOLO-GOUS STEM CELL SOURCE-dependent on age, underlying disease, donor availability, institutional preference. In general, allogeneic transplant is more suitable for younger, healthier adults as it is more toxic but potentially more effective than autologous transplant ALLOGENEIC-acute leukemia (50-70% cure if first remission, 10-30% cure if relapse), myelodysplastic syndrome (40-50% cure rate), chronic myeloid leukemia (50-70% cure if chronic phase, 10-30% cure if blast phase), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, indolent lymphoma, severe immunodeficiency syndromes, hemoglobinopathies AUTOLOGOUS-progressive Hodgkin's lymphoma (60-70% cure if relapse, 40-50% cure if refractory disease), multiple myeloma, progressive large cell lymphoma, relapsed germ cell cancer ALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANTATION HUMAN LEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN MOLECULESresponsible for displaying endogenous and exogenous peptides to T cells.
