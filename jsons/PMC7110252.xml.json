First, we applied multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis for matched case-control studies to assess vaccine effectiveness independent of confounding factors. In the modeling procedure, factors that appeared to be strongly associated with both exposure to vaccination and case status were first added to the naive model that included vaccination status only. Additionally, those risk factors that substantially altered the odds ratio of vaccine effectiveness further (>5 percent) were entered in the model (23). Although it has been shown that vaccine uptake is determined by patient rather than practice or physician factors (24), we extended the analysis by matching by practice, which did not materially change the results. Since circulating viruses and vaccination components differed in the two seasons and only a minority of subjects were admitted to the study during both seasons, we pooled the observations and performed similar analyses on case and control person-periods (25). Moreover, we decided in advance to use statistical interaction terms to determine potential modification of vaccine effectiveness by age (18\u201339, 40\u201364 years), sex, disease (asthma or COPD), and care by a pulmonologist. Adjusted odds ratios, as approximations of relative risks, and their 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated.",

This technique enables assessment of the association of an intervention, that is, vaccination, with outcomes in patients who have an equal probability of receiving the vaccine. Potential predictors were included in a logistic regression analysis, with vaccination as the dependent variable. The analysis was used to estimate the probability of vaccination (propensity score) for each individual patient in the full data set (256 cases, 976 controls). The fit of the model that included age and sex, health insurance, underlying disease, use of prednisolone and inhaled corticosteroids, specialist care, and cardiac and other comorbidity was appropriate (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test: p = 0.41), and the model\u2019s discriminative ability was moderate to good, with a value of 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.68, 0.75) for the area under the receiver operating curve. In a patient-matching procedure, we searched for a vaccinated person who had a propensity score closest (within a range of 0.00\u20130.01) to that for each unvaccinated patient. Thus, in this quasi-experiment, two comparison groups that had an equal probability of vaccination were formed, and, in an analogy to the analysis of trials, cumulative incidences of complications were compared.",

Since many immunization guidelines recommend influenza vaccination for patients with asthma or COPD, vaccine effectiveness cannot be assessed in a placebo-controlled trial. The case-control approach enables assessment of the effects of vaccination on severe endpoints for which incidence is relatively low. An advantage of the nested case-control study includes reduction of bias due to inappropriate selection of controls. Exposure rates in controls were similar in both seasons and were comparable with those in the baseline cohort. Although the controls were somewhat older than the total cohort, the distribution of some important characteristics in vaccinated and unvaccinated controls was comparable with that in the baseline cohort.

            "text": " Several potential limitations of our study need to be considered. A major issue in nonexperimental evaluation of vaccines is often that vaccinated and unvaccinated patients are not prognostically comparable. As expected, and as shown in the present and previous studies, vaccinees have more risk factors than nonvaccinees (4\u20136, 25, 28). This fact may have obscured a positive effect of vaccination. However, we minimized this so-called confounding by indication in both the design and data-analysis phases of the study (23). First, we admitted into the study cohorts only those patients who had current asthma or COPD. Recent studies have shown that only in a few patients registered as having asthma or COPD were the diagnoses not confirmed by spirometry (29, 30). Second, since age and sex are major confounders, we matched cases and controls for these factors. In addition, matched analysis by general practice did not change our results. Third, we had information on many potential confounders, and we adjusted for them by using conditional logistic regression. Once we had controlled for the matching factors and just three additional risk factors (previous vaccination, specialist care, and prednisolone use in the previous year), further adjustment for eight additional risk factors did not alter the estimates of vaccine effectiveness. Finally, we applied the propensity score method as an effective technique to control for confounding by indication (26, 27). Although the statistical power of the latter approach was more limited, risk factors were apparently distributed similarly in the selected vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects, and no difference was found in the incidence of outcomes. Obviously, only a large, randomized controlled trial will guarantee absence of confounding, but it is very unlikely that the observed lack of vaccine effectiveness in our nonexperimental study could be explained by residual confounding in our data.",

However, from a societal point of view, the influenza-related needs for health care of patients of working-age are mainly limited to relatively less severe complications treated in primary care settings or at outpatient clinics (refer to the Appendix). For example, Rothbarth et al. (14) estimated that, in the Netherlands, 11 excess deaths occur in this group of half a million persons during influenza epidemics. In other words, if the vaccine could prevent 50 percent of the deaths (5), more than 100,000 patients would need to be vaccinated to prevent one death. A major strength of our study is that virologic analyses of a sample of our cases and controls showed that influenza infection was frequently associated with these complications, and we found much higher prevalences than those reported in earlier influenza studies in this age group (10, 11). Furthermore, in season one, which was predominated by influenza B types, most of the positive cases had influenza A infection. This finding accords with ours and findings from others that the incidence of cases was much lower in this season compared with the influenza A season. We were not able to verify retrospectively whether case ascertainment was complete. However, occurrence rates of pneumonia, acute cardiac disease, and death in the 1999\u20132000 influenza A season were comparable with data from a previous study in a smaller group of similar patients followed up during the 1995\u20131996 influenza A epidemic (6).",

Since more than 500,000 working-age patients with asthma or COPD are currently indicated for influenza vaccination at a cost of 7 million euros (approximately $13 million) annually, we are convinced that, from a cost-effectiveness point of view, lower than 35 percent reductions in severe outcomes as a result of vaccination do not justify such a costly, large-scale campaign. Other less severe endpoints such as productivity loss or minor exacerbations might be reduced by vaccination, although it is unlikely in light of our results.

Although the occurrence of endpoints was twice as high in COPD patients compared with asthmatics in our study, the vaccine did not reduce the incidence of endpoints in either group. It is still unclear why the vaccine is clinically not effective in both patient groups less than age 65 years. One possible explanation could be that virus-induced allergy and hyperreactivity as precipitating factors may be a much more significant pathologic mechanism in adults than in young children and the elderly (11, 37, 38). If this explanation is true, preventive measures other than vaccination against influenza, such as self-management programs aimed at reducing the number and severity of exacerbations of asthma or COPD, may have a larger impact on the influenza-related health burden in this particular group of high-risk patients than does annual influenza vaccination.",
