            "text": "Although most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly have a respiratory tract infection, a proportion of patients progress to a more severe and systemic disease, characterised by treatmentresistant pyrexia, acute lung injury with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, and multiple organ dysfunction, associated with substantial mortality. 1 Many patients with severe COVID-19 present with coagulation abnormalities that mimic other systemic coagulopathies associated with severe infections, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic microangiopathy, but COVID-19 has distinct features. 2 Coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of death. 3 Furthermore, the relevance of COVID-19-coagulation abnormalities are becoming increasingly clear as a substantial proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 develop, sometimes unrecognised, venous and arterial thromboembolic complications. 4, 5 In this Comment we summarise the characteristics of COVID-19 coagulopathy, coagulation laboratory findings in affected patients, the prohaemostatic state and incidence of thromboembolic events, and potential therapeutic interventions.",

In a series 6 of 1099 patients with COVID-19 from China, elevated D-dimer (>0\u00b75 mg/L) was found in 260 (46%) of 560 patients. In another observational study 3 in 183 patients with COVID-19 in China, a mean D-dimer concentration of 2\u00b712 mg/L (range 0\u00b777-5\u00b727) was measured in patients who didn't survive compared to a concentration of 0\u00b761 mg/L (0\u00b735-1\u00b729) in survivors. A third study 7 found that patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had significantly higher median D-dimer concentrations (2\u00b74 mg/L, IQR 0\u00b76-14\u00b74) than patients who received no ICU care (0\u00b75 mg/L, 0\u00b73-0\u00b78). In another study, 8 D-dimer on admission greater than 1 mg/L resulted in an 18-times increased risk of death (95% CI 2\u00b76-128\u00b76; p=0\u00b70033).",

            "text": "Studies 6, 7 in consecutive patients with COVID-19 have reported that only about 5% of patients present with a platelet count of less than 100 \u00d7 10\u2079 cells per L. However, mild thrombocytopenia (a platelet count of <150 \u00d7 10\u2079 cells per L) can be found in 70-95% of patients with severe COVID-19. Thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 has not been found to be an important predictor of disease progression or adverse outcome. 5, 7 Mean fibrinogen concentrations in patients with COVID-19 are at the upper limits of normal, presumably as an acute phase response. However, a sudden decrease in plasma fibrinogen to concentrations less than 1\u00b70 g/L was observed shortly before death in a number of patients with COVID-19 in China. 3 Plasma concentrations of antithrombin are lower in COVID-19 non-survivors than in survivors (84% of normal in non-survivors vs 91% in survivors); however, plasma concentrations rarely drop below 80% of normal. 3 The combination of thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, and increased D-dimer is suggestive of DIC, although the pattern is distinctively different to DIC seen in sepsis. 2 In sepsis, thrombocytopenia is usually more profound, and D-dimer concentrations do not reach the high values seen in patients with COVID-19. In fact, most patients with COVID-19 would not be classified as having DIC according to the DIC score of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. 2, 3 Other laboratory abnormalities in COVID-19 that might be relevant for the coagulopathy are increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and in some patients, strikingly high ferritin concentrations reminiscent of findings in thrombotic microangiopathy. 8 Post-mortem findings in patients with COVID-19 show typical microvascular platelet-rich thrombotic depositions in small vessels of the lungs and other organs. However, there are no signs of haemolysis or schistocytes in the blood film and the platelet count is higher than would be expected in case of thrombotic microangiopathy (preprint reference; appendix).",

TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 are the main mediators driving a suppression of endogenous anticoagulant pathways. In a subset of patients most severely affected by COVID-19, a cytokine storm profile can be found, characterised by high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 9 Coronavirus infections are also associated with a remarkable activation of the fibrinolytic system. Observations in urokinase-type plasminogen activator knock-out mice pointed to a urokinase-driven pathway stimulating fibrinolysis and being an important factor in lethality. In addition, plasma concentrations of tissuetype plasminogen activator (t-PA) were 6-times higher in patients infected with human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) than in patients with no infection (appendix). Inflammation-induced endothelial cell injury could result in massive release of plasminogen activators, which could explain the high concentrations of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products in patients with severe COVID-19.",

In view of the hypercoagulable state of patients with severe COVID-19, and the potential increased risk of thrombosis, we suggest that all patients with COVID-19 that are admitted to hospital should receive this prophylactic treatment in the absence of medical contraindications.

Patients with severe COVID-19 might need higher-dose thromboprophylaxis than is generally given because of their hypercoagulable state, and this hypothesis will be tested in several multicentre, randomised, controlled trials (NCT04372589, NCT04367831, NCT04345848, and NCT04366960).",

In patients with a strong suspicion of pulmonary embolism in whom no objective diagnosis can be obtained, therapeutic anticoagulation could be started, particularly in the absence of risk factors for bleeding or other contraindications for anticoagulation. Of note, the incidence of haemorrhagic complications in patients with COVID-19, even those with severe coagulopathy, appear to be low. 4 Other anticoagulant modalities have not yet been systematically studied in patients with COVID-19 and cannot be advocated at this point.
