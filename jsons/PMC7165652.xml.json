            "text": "Many epidemiological and engineering studies have shown that airborne transmission is a major person\u2010to\u2010person respiratory transmission route (Barker et al., 2001; Cole and Cook, 1998; Hodgson et al., 2012; Mendell et al., 2002; Morawska et al., 2013; Nicas et al., 2005; Tellier, 2006). As a special airborne transmission route, interunit dispersion, namely cross\u2010transmission between units in the same building, was identified in Hong Kong during the outbreak of SARS in 2003 (HWFB\u2010HK, 2003; Yu et al., 2004). Apart from dispersion through interior doors and window leakage (Li et al., 2005a,b; Yu et al., 2004), dispersion through open windows in building envelopes has attracted increasing attention (Ai and Mak, 2014a; Ai et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2008, 2009; Liu et al., 2010, 2011a,b; Niu and Tung, 2008; Wang et al., 2010). The present study only focuses on the latter, which usually exists in residential buildings where natural ventilation through open windows is the most common ventilation mode. Such interunit dispersion can be a valid route for disease transmission, essentially because of the short dispersion distances between units in the same building and the large openings that may involve considerable airflow exchanges.",

Later, a series of wind tunnel experiments (Liu et al., 2010, 2011a,b; Wang et al., 2010) revealed that wind\u2010induced interunit dispersion could occur along both horizontal and vertical directions. However, it was difficult to take accurate measurements of the indoor concentration level in a wind tunnel experiment using highly reduced\u2010scale models (Mfula et al., 2005). Considering the uncontrollable boundary conditions of an on\u2010site measurement and the scale problem of wind tunnel experiments (van Hooff and Blocken, 2010), Ai et al. (2013) and Ai and Mak (2014a) used CFD methods to study the wind\u2010dominated interunit dispersion around multistory buildings. Their CFD results identified typical interunit dispersion routes and quantified re\u2010entry ratios, demonstrating the severity of interunit dispersion. Their studies also suggest that the CFD method is a suitable research tool for the study of interunit dispersion. However, they used RANS models and thus only obtained mean dispersion routes and re\u2010entry ratios. Considering the highly fluctuating characteristics of a coupled indoor and outdoor flow (Ai and Mak, 2014c; Etheridge, 2011; Haghighat et al., 1991, 2000; Linden, 1999; Straw, 2000), the mean results may not be sufficient to describe an interunit dispersion process. In addition, the timescales of interunit dispersion, which cannot be obtained from a steady simulation, are important for an infectious risk assessment. Therefore, a transient investigation of interunit dispersion using an advanced numerical model, such as LES, is necessary.",

Many studies comparing the performance of RANS and LES models (e.g., Caciolo et al., 2012; Gousseau et al., 2011a; Jiang and Chen, 2001; Murakami, 1993; Rodi, 1997; Salim et al., 2011; Tominaga and Stathopoulos, 2010, 2011) have clearly demonstrated the superiority of LES models in predicting both flow and concentration fields in built environments, although LES modeling requires greater computational resources.",

The rationality of using tracer gas is also supported by some studies regarding the size and behavior of respiratory droplet nuclei (Wells, 1934; Mitman, 1945; Duguid, 1946; Brundrett, 1992; CDCP, 1994; Nicas et al., 2005; Morawska, 2006; Tellier, 2006; Gao et al., 2009). In particular, Duguid (1946) showed that respiratory droplet nuclei are most commonly between 1 and 2 \u03bcm in diameter. A review by Morawska (2006) showed that viruses range from 0.02 to 0.3 \u03bcm in diameter; for instance, an individual SARS coronavirus ranges from 0.075 to 0.16 \u03bcm and an influenza virus is of a similar size. Simulations by Gao and Niu (2007), Gao et al. (2009) suggested that aerosols with diameters <2.5 \u03bcm disperse like gaseous pollutants. The smaller aerosols are less influenced by gravity than larger aerosols, which thus could suspend in air for a longer time and be transported over a greater distance by airflows (Morawska et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2007). In addition, these smaller aerosols have a chance to deposit in the lower respiratory tract and thus could cause serious negative effects on human health (Tellier, 2006; Thomas, 2013). Despite of the need to investigate smaller aerosols, the importance of larger aerosols in disease transmission (Thomas, 2013) should not be ignored, which, however, cannot be represented by tracer gas.",

With regard to dispersion simulation, the tracer gas CO2 is released in the center of a source unit and the evolution of concentrations in all units is then examined to record its dispersion characteristics. The CO2 is generated constantly at a rate of 8.0 mg/s. This emission rate is low enough to avoid the density effect on the dispersion and on the calculation of ventilation rate.",

The LES model is used to predict both flow and concentration fields transiently. The governing equations are discretized to algebraic equations based on the finite volume method (FVM). The discretization method for the pressure and diffusive terms is a second\u2010order scheme, whereas a second\u2010order bounded central\u2010differencing scheme is used for the convective term. A second\u2010order implicit scheme is used for temporal discretization. Finally, the pressure\u2013velocity coupling method is SIMPLEC. The convergence of each time step is achieved when both the area averaged wind speed and CO2 concentration at the opening of the source unit are stable for at least five iterations. Based on the converged mean flow and concentration fields generated by a RANS model, the transient simulation of flow and concentration fields using the LES model continues for a sufficient period of time (approximately 3 flow\u2010through time T\nft, namely 1200\u0394t* in the present study) to avoid the influence of initial conditions and to obtain statistically stable average results, where T\nft = D\nL/U\nH with D\nL the domain length and \u0394t* is the non\u2010dimensional time step size, defined as \u0394t* = \u0394t \u00d7 U\nH/H with \u0394t the time step size. Here \u0394t* is equal to 0.044. Note that at this stage, the concentration field corresponds to a background tracer gas, which is O2 in the present study. Then the tracer gas CO2 is generated in the source unit, and the transient flow and concentration fields are computed simultaneously.

Detailed analyses of the fluctuating behaviors of a single\u2010sided ventilation rate as well as the transient flow patterns around a single opening, under various wind directions, can be found in Ai and Mak (2014c). Owing to the highly fluctuating flow field, it is necessary to analyze the interunit dispersion transiently. As shown in Figure 5b, the continuous release of tracer gas in a source unit (namely WM3) results in a quick elevation of the concentration level in that unit, and the accumulated tracer gas then starts to transmit to adjacent units (e.g., WEd3) at a later moment. Such interunit dispersion would eventually achieve a dynamically stable state. The times that separate the whole evolution period into the pre\u2010stable period and the dynamically stable period are carefully identified through sensitivity tests. When a time is identified, the linear regression is made on a concentration curve within the dynamically stable period. A final time is selected if further changing this time results in no more than 5% of deviations to both the coefficient and the R\n2 value of the regressed linear equation. For all wind directions, these final concentration levels in other units are, on average, two to four orders of magnitude lower than those in the corresponding source units.",

Some previous wind tunnel experiments also found that asymmetrical concentration results exist between geometrically symmetrical observing locations (e.g., Liu et al., 2010). The possible reason for this difference is that the concentration transport is governed by more complex transport mechanisms than the velocity and pressure fields. Recently, it was found that there is an important concentration transport mechanism, namely the countergradient mechanism (i.e., tracer gas transports from low\u2010concentration areas to high\u2010concentration areas), see, for example, Gousseau et al.

The non\u2010dimensional times have the same definition with that specified in the caption of Figure 3. Figure 8 shows two aspects worthy of discussion. The first is the influencing factors of the distribution and magnitude of the timescales. For a specific unit, the timescales do not show an obvious relation with its distance to the source unit and the approaching wind direction. However, the timescales on the buildings without balconies scatter at a larger range than those with balconies. The relatively uniform distribution of timescales on the buildings with balconies should be ascribed to the fact that the balconies disturb the near\u2010wall flow, resulting in a more dynamically stable envelope concentration field. Generally, under the normal and oblique wind directions, the timescales on windward sides are shorter than those on leeward sides, as larger pressure fields near the windward sides intensify quick dispersion of the tracer gas. The second aspect is the magnitudes of these timescales. The magnitudes of Th* values are mostly comparable with those of natural ventilation. Based on the present physical model, the non\u2010dimensional times required to achieve one whole\u2010unit air replacement for the typical naturally ventilated ACH values of 5, 10, and 20 are 53.3, 26.7, and 13.3, respectively. Here these ACH values occur commonly in naturally ventilated buildings (Ai et al., 2015; Niu and Tung, 2008). Such comparable magnitudes are to be expected as interunit dispersion occurs based on the natural ventilation system and the interunit dispersion is governed by the indoor and outdoor airflow exchange mechanisms.",

Among these timescales, the ranges of T0.0001* are particularly interesting, representing the times required to achieve M\ni\u2013j values of 1:10 000. Considering that a respiratory process, such as coughing and sneezing, can produce millions of aerosol particles (Duguid, 1946), T0.0001* may represent the times required by the first stream of pathogen\u2010laden aerosols to reach an infected unit. Previous particle simulations by Gao et al. (2009) suggested a comparable timescale to the first arrivals with the T0.0001* values listed in Table 3. Generally, a shorter time is required to reach a specific M\ni\u2013j in a unit that is closer to the source unit (these figures are not presented).",

Figure 9 presents the non\u2010dimensional concentration (non\u2010dimensionalized by C\ni) distributions on the windward facades of the buildings under normal wind direction at six different moments. Based on Figure 9, three observations can be made. First, dispersion route is not constant, the main dispersion direction varies with time. This variation is stochastic, implying that the incursion of pollutants into a specific unit is intermittent. Such characteristics significantly broaden the dispersion scope and thus increase the difficulty of control. Second, there could be secondary interunit dispersions around multistory buildings, as shown clearly in Figure 9e,f. Secondary dispersion could be an important mechanism of interunit dispersion. It indicates that a portion of pollutants entering a specific unit could come from an infected unit, rather than directly from the source unit. This feature also contributes to extending dispersion scope and increases dispersion uncertainty. Third, the presence of balconies helps increase the uniformity of pollutant distribution on the buildings' facades, as their presence hinders the development of main dispersion directions. These envelope dispersion characteristics under normal wind direction represent the general dispersion circumstances of other cases not presented in this study.",

Within a specific unit, the number of infectious quanta may be estimated by the re\u2010entry quantity of infected air originating from the source unit, based on the concentration of pathogens. Such re\u2010entry quantities in various circumstances are provided in the present study. However, the present study cannot provide a universal safe threshold for the re\u2010entry ratio to estimate the infectious risk for a specific unit, as the size of a quantum is strongly related to the type of pathogen and the physical condition of susceptible persons. Previous studies by Franz et al. (1997) showed that many pathogens can cause disease with several to dozens of organisms, such as viral hemorrhagic fevers (1\u201310), Q fever (1\u201310), tularemia (10\u201350), brucellosis (10\u2013100), and smallpox (10\u2013100). For highly infectious bacteria like M. tuberculosis, even a single organism is sufficient to cause disease, while a cough may produce around 3000 organisms (Duguid, 1946; Fitzgerald and Haas, 2005). When exposed to a certain concentration level of a pathogen, the exposure time should be controlled. Isolating the infectors as early as possible to reduce exposure time and ventilating the suspected regions sufficiently are effective methods (Tang et al., 2006) to control infection.",

            "text": "Another aspect that is important to the estimation of airborne infectious risk is the ratio of two timescales: the timescale required to accumulate a quantum and the timescale of the pathogen's survival. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the two timescales have not been compared previously. The prerequisite of the occurrence of an airborne infection is that at least a quantum of organisms produced by an infector must remain both airborne and survive to be inhaled by a susceptible person (Tang et al., 2006). If the pathogen's survival time is shorter than the timescale needed to accumulate a quantum of this pathogen in a target unit, the occupants in this unit are safe and thus no protective measures are required. Unfortunately, previous data have shown that many pathogens can survive in aerosols for a very long time, such as human coronavirus 229E, which survives for several to dozens of hours (Ijaz et al., 1985); influenza viruses, which survive for up to 24 h (Loosli et al., 1943); and SARS coronavirus, which survives for more than 7 days (Lai et al., 2005). These survival times are much longer than the timescales of interunit dispersion. However, the survival time of a pathogen is affected by many factors (Morawska, 2006; Tang et al., 2006). In certain circumstances, the survival time of a SARS virus is only several minutes (WHO, 2003), a period comparable with most interunit dispersion timescales. Therefore, for a specific pathogen under a certain physical environment, it is meaningful and necessary to make a comparison of its survival time and the timescales of interunit dispersion in order to take more accurate and effective intervention measures.",
