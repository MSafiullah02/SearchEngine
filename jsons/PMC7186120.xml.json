He reported that 2 to 3 weeks before his hospital presentation he had had subjective fever, myalgias, sore throat, and cough, which he had treated with multiple doses of ibuprofen. These complaints resolved 1 week before this hospital presentation, but he subsequently developed worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and anorexia that persisted for the following week, leading to his hospital presentation. He described lightheadedness when rising from a recumbent position. He reported decreased urine output but denied gross hematuria, frothy urine, or flank pain. He denied any new lower extremity edema or orthopnea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in mentation, persistent respiratory infectious symptoms, recent travel, or sick contacts. Other than his recent use of ibuprofen, he denied any other medication, vitamin supplementation, or herbal remedy. His medical history included obesity and obstructive sleep apnea for which he used nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Baseline serum creatinine was 1.1 mg/dl (estimated glomerular filtration rate by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation, 93 ml/min per 1.73 m2) on routine laboratory testing 16 months prior. He had no family history of kidney disease. He was born in Nigeria, worked as a nurse, lived with his wife and children in New York City, and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs.",

CG not associated with HIV/AIDS was first described in the mid-1980s in a small case series of African American patients with nephrotic syndrome and rapidly progressive irreversible kidney failure.1 CG is an aggressive variant of FSGS exhibiting high rates of podocyte injury and depletion. Light microscopy is typified by hyperplastic and hypertrophic visceral epithelial cells overlying segmentally or globally collapsed glomerular capillaries that are narrowed or obliterated by wrinkling and retraction of glomerular basement membranes. At the ultrastructural level, podocytes show severe foot process effacement with focal podocyte detachment and parietal cell coverage. Cases associated with viral infection, such as HIV, may have endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions (interferon footprints). The tubulointerstitial compartment often contains an infiltrate of mononuclear cells, including monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and variable plasma cells. Tubular epithelial cells typically display degenerative and regenerative changes and aberrant cellular proliferation and differentiation, leading to microcystic transformation. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis are common; however, comparative studies have shown that these indices were numerically but not significantly more frequent in CG compared with noncollapsing FSGS.2 A dysregulated podocyte phenotype has been identified in both HIV and non\u2013HIV-associated CG. As podocytes are injured and depleted, the visceral epithelial cells show downregulation and loss of mature podocyte markers with de novo expression of markers associated with proliferation and activated parietal epithelial cells.3\n,\n4\n",

            "text": "CG not associated with HIV/AIDS may be idiopathic or associated with a variety of conditions, including other viral infections (such as Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus B19) and nonviral infections (such as tuberculosis), autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), drug exposures (such as pamidronate and interferon), hemophagocytic syndrome, and acute glomerular ischemia, among others.5 Many of these exposures are thought to mediate CG by podocyte cytotoxicity, such as via proinflammatory cytokine expression including type 1 interferons.6 It is also well recognized that a large proportion of patients with CG carry 2 allelic risk variants of APOL1, namely G1 and G2, which are common in individuals of West African ancestry and also confer risk for hypertension-attributed end-stage kidney disease.7 Indeed, the APOL1 high-risk genotype (either G1/G1, G1/G2, or G2/G2), which is found in approximately 10% to 15% of the African American population, is disproportionately represented in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy and non\u2013HIV-associated CG. In general, patients with 2 high-risk APOL1 alleles have a higher likelihood of eventually reaching end-stage kidney disease, although their response to immunosuppression is not modified by their APOL1 high-risk status.8 Evidence from animal models and cell culture systems suggests that the high-risk APOL1 genotype may mediate podocyte damage via upregulation of APOL1 through activation of a viral program in the podocyte, leading to dysregulated endosomal trafficking and autophagic flux, resulting in podocyte depletion and glomerular scarring.6 With the exception of HIV-associated nephropathy and parvovirus B19\u2013associated CG, in which virus has been identified in renal epithelial cells, other virally mediated forms of CG in patients with high-risk APOL1 genotype typically lack evidence of direct viral infection of the renal parenchyma, supporting potential interferon-mediated podocyte effects. In our case, in situ hybridization did not detect SARS-CoV-2 in the renal tissue.",

Those patients with kidney disease had higher in-hospital mortality; moreover, there was evidence of hematuria in 26.7% and proteinuria in 43.9% of patients in their cohort. Although kidney tissue was not examined, the authors postulated potential multifactorial renal injury, including direct cytopathic effects (via viral entry through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors expressed on tubular epithelium), as well as tubular injury from cytokine storm, shock, and rhabdomyolysis.S5 A recent publication of kidney findings at autopsy among 26 patients from China who died of severe respiratory failure from COVID-19 disease revealed that the predominant findings were acute tubular injury, erythrocyte aggregation in peritubular capillaries, and direct viral infection of tubular epithelium and podocytes; none had CG, although 2 had FSGS, but the morphologic variant of FSGS was not specified.S6 The heightened cytokine release associated with COVID-19 infection places patients with the APOL1 high-risk genotype particularly at risk for interferon-mediated podocyte injury, as can occur in other virally mediated forms of CG, interferon therapy\u2013induced CG, and lupus-associated CG. Patients with COVID-19 may have a biphasic disease course whereby after an initial onset of symptoms there is a time lapse (\u223c8 days) of worsening respiratory symptoms that corresponds with an exuberant inflammatory response.S3 In our patient with APOL1 high-risk genotype, it is plausible that an exuberant inflammatory response induced CG without the usual predominant pulmonary manifestations.",

Larsen and colleaguesS7 reported another patient with CG associated with COVID-19 with more significant pulmonary manifestations. CG has not been reported in outbreaks in China and Europe, probably because APOL1 high-risk genotypes are present only in populations of African ancestry. High-risk genotypes have been reported in 10% to 15% of African American individuals and can also be detected in persons of Hispanic/Afro-Caribbean ancestry. Considering the projected 50% to 80% attack rates of COVID-19 in the general population,S8,S9 a significant fraction of the population with West African ancestry may be at risk of developing kidney injury from CG as the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps through the Americas and the African continent. As we learn more about the renal manifestations of COVID-19, we should keep in mind the possibility of CG among patients with COVID-19 with proteinuria and acute kidney injury, even among those with mild respiratory disease. Future research will be needed to determine optimal management, and particularly whether there is a role for antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies, including nonspecific agents like glucocorticoids or targeted therapies against specific cytokines or leukocyte subsets (Table 2\n).",
