Two seemingly different questions may refer implicitly to a common problem with the same answer. Identifying semantic equivalence is thus critical for retrieving similar questions and to automate reusing answers available for such previous questions. This is a difficult task because different users may formulate the same question in a variety of ways, using different vocabulary (e.g., watersports vs. snorkeling) and structure. Similar questions hence vary in style, length and content quality (e.g., blood pressure vs. hypertension).",

Similarity - different from relatedness (e.g., synonymy, antonymy) - has been addressed with strategies like machine translation, knowledge graphs and topic models though. Treating question-answer pairs as parallel text, relationships can be established through translation probability (e.g., word-to-word) - asymmetry being a handicap. Latent topics aligned across question-answer pairs is another option - heterogeneity being an issue.",

Considering only surface form of a question without factoring in semantics makes it hard to identify duplicates. Keyword-based retrieval methods (e.g., language/vector-space models) hence predict questions with same meaning as different. Traditional similarity measures based on word overlap - even those on a graded scale from 0 to 5 - have thus proven to be inadequate for capturing semantic equivalence.",

Also, submitted questions have extraneous details - which obscures key information buried in the noise - in the body irrelevant to main question being asked. Title alone on the other hand lacks crucial detail present in question body. Building a large amount of training data with similar questions is expensive and careful feature engineering is time consuming. Deep learning techniques recently have been effective for sentence-level analysis of short texts in a variety of IR tasks. Size of a question in an online community however varies from a single sentence to detailed problem description with many sentences.",

Questions are scored next with a metric (e.g., cosine similarity) and those pairs above a threshold based on a held-out set are considered equivalent. During training, CNN is induced to produce similar vector representations for equivalent questions. We discuss: [1] evaluates in-domain word embeddings vs. one trained with Wikipedia, estimates impact of training set size and evaluates aspects of domain adaptation, [2] combines bag of words (BoW) to retrieve equivalent questions while learning to rank them according to similarity with a loss function, [4] integrates sentence modeling and semantic matching into a single framework without syntactic analysis and prior knowledge (e.g., wordnet). Word tokens are converted into vectors by a lookup layer and useful information is captured with convolutional/pooling layers; finally, matching metric is learnt - better than traditional ones (e.g., inner-product, Euclidean distance) - between question/answer capturing their interaction with a tensor layer.\n",

This meta-data encodes attributes/properties of words from which similar words can be grouped according to categories. Language models represent words and question categories in a vector space and calculate question-question similarity with linear combinations of dot products of vectors - thus being heuristic on data or difficult to scale up. Each question is thus defined as a distribution which generates each word (embedding) independently and subsequently a kernel is used to assess question similarities. This design will require representation of words that belong to the same category to be close to each other thus benefiting embedding learning. We discuss: [3] learns variable-length word embeddings with category information and aggregates them into fixed-size vectors, [8] optimizes an objective which in turn applies a non-linear transformation considering only local-relatedness of words (i.e., category and small window in a question/associated answers), [12] outperforms text-based methods in misflagged duplicate detection with features like user authority, question quality and relational data between questions.\n",

To combat scarcity of similar question pairs for training, question-answer pairs from archives can be leveraged in a weakly supervised fashion without manual labeling. An added advantage of this approach is mapping simple terms used by novice askers (e.g., short sighted) to technical terms (e.g., myopia) and concepts (e.g., lasik/laser surgery, contact lens) used by expert answerers. We discuss: [5] learns shared parameters and similarity metric minimizing contrastive-loss energy function connecting twin networks, [7] preserves local neighborhood structure of and mirrors semantic similarity among question and answer spaces, [9] represents hierarchical structures of word and concept information with layer-by-layer composition and pooling leading to question embedding that captures semantics/syntax.\n",
