            "text": "During the past 25 years, the quantity of meat consumed in developing countries grew three times as much as in developed countries. This trend is forcasted to continue; it is estimated that demand for meat and milk products will double over the next two decades in the developing world. Delgado et al. (1999) estimate the annual demand for meat in the developing world to grow from 111 million tons in 1997 to 213 million tons in 2020. Over the same period, milk consumption would grow from 194 million tons to 324 million tons per year in the developing world. This demand\u2010driven increase in animal agriculture, termed \u2018Livestock Revolution\u2019 (Delgado et al., 1999) will have to come from expanding intensive rearing systems in the developing world. The sector will shift from a resource (feed availability) driven system to a demand driven system, from a roughage based system to a cereal based system; livestock will loose much of its multi\u2010functionality, and will be mainly kept for meat and milk (De Haan, 2001). The Livestock Revolution might crowd out a large number of smallholder livestock keepers, thus eliminating one of the most powerful approaches to rural poverty reduction for more than 600 million rural poor. The crowding out is already occurring in many middle\u2010income countries, where there is a strong concentration of production and processing (De Haan, 2001). Intensified or even industrialized production implies that agriculture is decoupled from the surrounding natural environment; systems are characterized by integration of input supply, food commodity production, processing and marketing. Monogastric animals (pigs and poultry) will be the most important source of growth; monogastric animals have a better concentrate feed conversion than ruminant animals; their production technology further is more universal and thus more amenable to large\u2010scale operations.",

Animals and animal products are crossing borders with logarithmically greater frequency than what it was even a decade or two ago (Brown, 2003). The global risk of foreign, emerging and re\u2010emerging animal diseases subsequently has increased in recent years. Most publicly noted were the 2000\u20132001 foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease outbreaks in Europe, South America, Asia and Africa, the worldwide continuing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza since 2003\u201304 and the 2002\u201303 Newcastle disease outbreak in the USA. New diseases transmitted from animals to humans under natural conditions (zoonoses) also have increased in numbers.

By 2020, they may account for 80% of the world's population but two\u2010thirds of direct consumption of meat and 60% of milk consumption. Livestock production traded across international borders has increased from 4% in the early 1980s to approximately 10%. Liberalized international markets with decreasing tariffs, \u2018tariffication\u2019 of non\u2010tariff barriers for some products and expanding membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) encourage globalization of the livestock sector by \u2018levelling the playing field\u2019 for all trading partners. Globalization integrates the economies through trade, flows of finance, knowledge, ideas and people. It is associated with a dynamic structural shift towards increased market orientation and integration, larger scales, geographical concentration and intensification.

A total of 177 species (13%) are regarded as emerging or re\u2010emerging, the majority being viruses (77 species), followed by bacteria (54), fungi (22), protozoa (14) and helminths (10). Within viruses, RNA viruses dominate, comprising 37% of all emerging and re\u2010emerging pathogens. RNA viruses are prominent among the subset of pathogens that have entered the human population in the past decades, such as HIV or the SARS coronavirus.

Ro is the average number of secondary infections produced by a single primary infection introduced into a large population of previously unexposed hosts. Antia et al. (2003) and Woolhouse and Gowtage\u2010Sequeria (2005) hypothesize that for pathogens that are moderately transmissible within human populations (corresponding to Ro approximately 1) outbreaks are possible upon small changes in Ro. Small changes in the nature of the host\u2013pathogen interaction can lead to large increases (or decreases) in the scale of the public health problem. An obvious reason for this is that it takes less change to achieve an Ro of more than one if the initial Ro is just below one. A less obvious reason is that the length of time a pathogen persists in the population before disappearing increases with Ro (Bull and Dykhuizen, 2003); pathogens with Ro nearly at unity can persist for a considerable time by chance. The longer the pathogen persists, the greater will be its opportunity to evolve into a higher Ro. Bull and Dykhuizen (2003) suggest that even with existing technology, methods could be developed for monitoring emerging pathogens, potentially distinguishing between strains with differing Ro values. The means provided by Antia et al. (2003), of identifying these epidemics\u2010in\u2010waiting could become a critical tool in a global defence strategy against emerging pathogens.",

The model graphically groups and overlays \u2018risk factors\u2019, being ecological factors, physical, environmental factors, genetic and biological factors and social, political and economic factors that determine whether an outbreak of an infectious disease is to occur or not. The central component of the convergence model is contact between humans and biological pathogens. Some risk factors favouring disease occurrence by increased contact due to humans are known, like when ecological and social, political and economic factors are disrupted; other risk factors are suspected, like when physical, environmental, ecological and genetic or biological factors in some intensity and sequence exert their influences on pathogens. However, other risk factors still are a closed book, particularly when the interplay of the multitude of factors out of the different areas is concerned.",

            "text": "Increasing global demand for animal products can only be met by intensification of production, given the very limited scope for extending the area of land suitable for agriculture (Upton and Otte, 2004). For the same reason, intensification is the only way of raising the incomes of people engaged in agriculture. More industrialized livestock production requires genetically uniform stock, which contributes to an erosion of domestic breed diversity as local breeds are \u2018crowded\u2019 out by so\u2010called modern breeds (FAO, 2001). From the 3237 existing livestock breeds in 1992, 617 breeds have become extinct since 1982, another 474 breeds are considered to be rare and endangered (Cip\u2010Upward, 2003). It is suggested that within a period of 100 years about 28% of livestock breed withered, became extinct or rare or endangered. Extreme examples are that almost all pigs reared under commercial farming systems in Europe and North America belong to only two or three breeds. Ninety per cent of all North American dairy cattle and 60% of all European cattle belong to only one breed, the Holstein. Organized poultry farming across the world relies on a few multinational companies who have developed a handful of breeds for their supply of stock (Tisdell, 2001). Such narrow genetic bases pose many inherent dangers. A narrow genetic base selected for a particular favourable production trait may be unsuitable to, for example, emerging disease problems and changes in climates (environmental tolerance).",

Multifunctionality, organic farming and sustainable agriculture rather are seen as foundations for the European model of agriculture as a whole (B\u00e9ranger, 2000). Doubts exist whether this model of agriculture of affluent countries with surplus production of foods can be taken particularly for developing countries with shortages of foods and very few alternatives to agricultural products to enter international markets. Intensive production for these countries in the short term successfully meets demands of populations for food products at economic prices. The hidden costs of such systems like demanding huge feed imports, environmental degradation and concerns over animal welfare present all involved in animal production, processing and marketing with a plethora of interlinked problems and challenges of far\u2010ranging significance. If this intensification is to be sustained or further increased, it will need mechanisms for effective coordination and collaboration at the international level. The foundation and chances for any success will lie in the availability of policies that are realistic and respected by all and not unduly influenced by one\u2010sided and short\u2010sighted economic interests. Realistically, crowding of animals into intensive units coupled with a further rise in international trade for some time will continue to exacerbate risks of new emerging diseases, food borne diseases and zoonoses.",

Epidemiologists try to assess these complex situations by using e.g. probability theory. Probability estimates change with increasing information; they tell us whether something will happen. Possibility estimates on the other hand tell us whether something can happen. Usually, when the possibility of an event is decreased, so is its probability but the reverse is not necessarily true. An event that is impossible will have a zero probability. However, if an event is improbable, it still could be 100% possible. Concerning public health risks, because no information at all or only scanty information is available, not even preliminary probability estimates can be used; it is impossible to predict the next infectious disease to emerge, and it is impossible to predict the source or risk factors involved.
