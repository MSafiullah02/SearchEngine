UVGI is based on the principle of air cycling by convection between irradiated air in the upper zone (clean) and the patient care area or lower zone (dirty). Upper room air UVGI devices are placed on the ceiling or mounted on the wall. These devices have been shown to effectively reduce the transmission of airborne bacterial infections in hospitals.[37] [38] [39]",

Typically, these rooms require more than 12 cycles of air changes/hour and, efficient filtrations systems that will allow air to flow away from the clean area or positive pressure room towards a negative pressure or depressurized area or less clean room (ex. room with an airborne disease patient). The time required for airborne contaminant removal from a room with 12 cycles of air changes/ hour with 99 and 99.9% efficiency is 23 and 35 minutes, respectively.

This is likely due to the high exchange rates of air in these negative pressure areas.[41] For hospital settings, ORs and ICUs are usually designed to accommodate these pressure differentials and this option is more feasible in the hospital setting. For outpatient clinics, the options for HEPA filtration and upper room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation methods, along with appropriate PPE, may be good options to decrease infection due to aerosol generating procedures.",

The experience during the SARS and MERS epidemic has shown that PVP-I has virucidal effect in- vitro, and it can potentially be used as an antiseptic rinse. [43] Kariwa et al in 2006, evaluated the efficacy of several povidone-iodine (PVP-I) products and a number of other chemical agents and various physical conditions to inactivate the SARS coronavirus in-vitro. They reported that treatment of SARS-CoV with 0.23% to 1% PVP-I products for 2 min reduced the viral infectivity from 1.17 x 10(6) TCID(50)/ml (50% tissue culture infectivity dose) to undetectable level. They reported that the efficacy of 70% ethanol was equivalent to that of PVP-I products.[42] In a recent In-Vivo study in the UK, the authors tested the use of 0\u00b75% PVP-I solution (0\u00b755 mg/mL available iodine) applied to the oral, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal mucosa of patients with presumed/confirmed COVID-19 as well as a rinse for the healthcare personnel (HCP) in close contact with this cohort.

During this Pandemic, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), along with other professional medical societies and organizations, made a decision to halt all \u201celective\u201d and \u201cnon-essential\u201d, \u201cnon-emergent\u201d surgeries and preventive services. CMS suggested a tiered (Tier 1-2-3) approach based on acuity of treatment or service and conveyed that each organization or local institution should consider shared decision-making on case- by- case basis. Medical Ethicists, Caplan and Thomas, argued that the terms \u201cNon-essential\u201d and \u201cElective\u201d are fraught with some confusion and emotion due to the vagueness of these terms, making it difficult to decide who would qualify for surgery. Instead, they suggest a framework that would answer 2 crucial decision-making questions: 1) whether the procedure is life-saving requiring immediate or urgent action, or 2) whether the procedure is non-life sustaining and does not take significant resources, but improves patient\u2019s quality-of-life. [45] Stahel has suggested that we implement algorithms that are clinically relevant and patient-safety driven to make surgical treatment decisions as shown in the figure. [46] He suggested stratification based on risk and resource utilization. Elective procedures can be divided into \u201cessential\u201d if an adverse outcome can occur due to delay in procedure for an undetermined period vs. \u201cnon-essential\u201d surgery or \u201cdiscretionary\u201d if it is not time sensitive.",

The developers are currently validating this scoring system. It may serve as a good tool that can be implemented in OMS prioritization after further iterations and validation. The American College of Surgeons has recommended using this method or a similar method applicable to each institution; ultimately, surgeons have to be fair to patients, make the best clinical and most ethical decision for their patients. For OMS, among the several medically necessary conditions that we treat apart from emergencies, the most time-sensitive procedures include treatment for malignancy (ex. oral cancer, salivary gland malignancy, osteosarcoma), neurological injuries, aggressive benign jaw tumors, congenital craniofacial anomalies (ex. cleft palate repair before speech development), and chronic pain conditions that are recalcitrant to medical therapy.",

The threshold to allow surgery may decrease gradually as the threat of overutilization of resources and threat of COVID -19 becomes lower. Given that all our procedures will be high-risk, we have to weigh our patient and disease factors carefully. We have to evaluate our facility needs and risks to our patients and alternative options of non-surgical treatment vs. implications of delaying treatment. Consider the case of a patient with severe OSA who is intolerant to CPAP and presents for maxillo-mandibular advancement. This is a high-risk AGP with higher utilization of resources due to possible postoperative ICU care or prolonged intubation in case of a complication and increased risk to the health care team, as well as the patient. Having a frank discussion with these patients to consider compliance with a non-surgical alternative therapy such as a CPAP with a different type of mask at least temporarily or, a hybrid method of CPAP with an oral device may pose less risk to all. On the other hand, delaying treatment in a patient who is non-compliant and unable to tolerate CPAP can increase the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, which will result in an overall bad outcome and utilization of more health system resources.",

The procedure is time sensitive with no alternative options and delay of 2-6 weeks\u2019 time can make the outcome moderately worse but the difficulty of the operation will not change. Based on the MeNTS scoring system if the length of procedure is short and it can be performed in an ambulatory setting, the score would add up to 31, which denotes favorable risk to personnel and resource utilization. Similarly, procedures such as placement of implants, dento-alveolar surgery, which are ambulatory procedures carry a higher risk to HCP and have lower resource utilization, possibly implying an overall favorable risk. Whether we modify and use this scoring method or an alternative, we will have to validate such scores for OMS procedures. In contrast, consider the options for a relatively healthy young female patient who requires Botox injection for intractable migraine headaches.

The authors highlight the conflicting interests of clinical ethics vs. public health ethics when considering population vs. individual interests.

In general, they suggest having a well thought-out plan through a collective decision making process with members of the tumor board, while taking into account patient preferences.[7] In such situations, looking at treatment models in limited resource settings with high volume cancer care such as the model described by Badwe et al. in the Tata Memorial Cancer Center where more than 70,000 new cancer patients, including a vast number with oral cancer are treated each year.[8] This disruption in surgical services for our cancer patients is also likely to stimulate further interest in considering immunotherapies that are more novel.

Educate and train the staff to use COVID-19 tools from state and federal websites and on new infection control policies, screening and testing for COVID-19, and incorporation of digital services / telemedicine to deliver care, create an inventory tool to estimate and calculate essential practice items (PPE and drugs). Being part of the broader solution is important, as any re-entry will need to be in-line with others in the supply chain \u2013 patient, community, ancillary staff, industry, and government. It would be prudent for OMS to take a fresh look at worst-case scenarios and develop contingency plans. Having a \u201cliving revival document\u201d that can easily be updated or withdrawn as necessary is vital. Some sort of preparation for (or at least discussion about) the next crisis (or the next phase of this crisis) between stakeholders in each practice at this time is highly recommended. Just as debriefings following emergency practice drills that are most informative, we learn most while this crisis is unfolding.

In addition, the economic downturn will continue the losses. This can lead to layoffs that will be disruptive to many OMS programs, which are not deep in employee numbers. We have to find ways to reduce costs to protect the core and character of their programs. Hiring freezes, travel restrictions, elimination of cost of living increases could be cost saving moves. Capital budget requests will be put on hold, most likely for two years. University and program endowments are often restricted to specific purposes set by the donors and cannot be used as a reserve fund. The decline in the investment market has resulted in decline in the market value of the endowments. The monies spun off the principal of these endowments that are used to support the institution\u2019s operations will also require cost reductions by individual operating units.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has opened our minds and forced us to mobilize and transition to a new and possibly an efficient healthcare delivery model through telemedicine, and increased virtual collaboration. Digital technologies can have a high impact on healthcare delivery if we adopt, validate and scale them to incorporate into our daily workflow. Prioritizing surgery will require objective methods and good clinical and ethical judgment on the part of the surgeon. The COVID-19 global pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of our health systems. OMS professionals and leaders have an unprecedented opportunity to work with community, institutional and professional leadership to implement care standards that address some of the flaws that have been recognized in our current healthcare system. High quality care that is appropriate, accessible and economically feasible delivered with pride and in a transparent fashion may be much closer to reality than it ever has been.",
