Retrospective examination of reports from the three regions in China most affected, Beijing,4 Guangdong2 and Hong Kong-SAR,3 suggested regional deficiencies in epidemiological data. Post-epidemic analysis using spatial diffusion process provides a powerful understanding of the geographic relationship between populations and their environment.5 However, it does not provide preliminary assistance that would identify potential hot spots of exposure as the outbreak unfolds. We carried out simple re-analysis of the Beijing data to determine which data could have provided information that would have resulting in early containment.",

            "text": "The original epidemic curve excluded those cases without a history for date of onset of illness, whereas re-analysis included these cases and plotted cases on an epidemic curve substituting the date of presentation to hospital for date of onset of illness. During the early phase (import and escalation phases) of the outbreak, case definition was in accordance with the Ministry of Health criteria6 in the absence of World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and a serology test. Re-analysis, therefore, also included cases initially excluded if they did not fulfil the Ministry of Health diagnostic criteria of SARS6 requiring cases with contact history of either direct case contact or contact with an endemic area. These cases were now re-classified according to WHO criteria,7 with cases classified as \u2018probable\u2019 cases only where their signs and symptoms were in accordance with criteria for one of three WHO definitions for \u2018probable\u2019 SARS. All 5327 cases available from the SARS epidemic database, collated by the Disease Control and Prevention Centre, Beijing,6 were now included in the epidemic curve. Cases were categorized into 15 occupational groups, with restaurants combined with hospitality services and the military and police services combined.8 Re-analysis included an epidemic curve for \u2018probable\u2019 SARS cases only and calculations of the Beijing population-based rate, stratified by age and sex, using the Fifth General Census of China (version 2000). The original analysis did not include a spot map. Re-analysis included cases plotted for 18 geographic areas with rates calculated per 100,000 residents and then regrouped into three geographic areas according to distance from the city centre: inner city, 5\u201310 km, and more than 10 km from the inner city. Denominator data were not available to calculate specific exposure rates, such as number of hospitalized patients for a healthcare-acquired infection rate, number of healthcare workers for an occupationally acquired rate or healthcare worker hours for occupationally acquired rate per hours of exposure. The epidemiologic curves were developed using Microsoft Excel 2000, and SPSS version 10 was used to calculate case fatality rates (CFR), odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals for proportions, rates, odds and rates, and tests for significance.",

Using the Ministry of Health's clinical criteria, 52% (2521/4844) were originally correctly classified as \u2018probable\u2019 SARS, whereas the remainder were \u2018possible\u2019 or \u2018non-SARS\u2019 cases. The case fatality rate for \u2018probable\u2019 cases was 7.6% (192/2521). Date of onset of illness for \u2018probable\u2019 cases was available for 74.0% (1867/2521), gender for 99.9% (2518/2521), age for 99.9% (2518/2521), 97.1% (2447/2521) residential area, 93.4% (2356/2521) occupation and 65.1% (125/192) time of death. New data for symptoms and radiological data enabled 96.9% (2443/2521) of previously classified cases to remain classified as \u2018probable\u2019, with 3.1% (78/2521) reclassified to \u2018possible\u2019 owing to undefined or unclear dates of onset of symptoms. Of the 2443 cases who fulfilled the \u2018probable\u2019 criteria, 576 failed to have date of onset of illness documented, but most of such cases (99.6%, 574/576) had date of admission, and all 574 were admitted early in the epidemic, during either March or April 2003. Analysis of the dataset for 1876 cases with documented dates for onset of illness and hospitalization identified time between onset of symptoms and hospitalization as on average 4.1 days. This average was used for 574 cases without date of onset of illness but with date of hospitalization, enabling a total of 2443 \u2018probable\u2019 cases to be included on a new epidemic curve. A total of 2323 who did not fulfil criteria for either \u2018probable\u2019 or \u2018possible\u2019 SARS were reclassified as non-SARS and excluded from all analysis.",

The decline in contact history should have raised suspicion that the definition of \u2018contact\u2019 in the initial phase could have benefited from a re-definition throughout the epidemic. Contact history during an outbreak involving progressive transmission should list exposure to animals, environmental contact (i.e. a hospital or geographic contact by virtue of residential location), as potential contacts. Such re-defining, along with spot maps for place of residency or occupation, would have still revealed the heavy case loads in the inner city areas. Although this is not always suggestive of a causative agent, it would be strongly supportive of the usefulness of geographical quarantining.",

Daily commuting to work across densely populated cities assists the dissemination of airborne or droplet spread diseases even when infectivity may be low.13 Excellent control measures were instigated during the early phase, including quarantining contacts and closing public social and education venues.12 However, basic spot mapping could support a policy for rapid and severe restriction of population movement within 30 km circumference from the city centre.",

As a result, during the first 24 days into the epidemic, the magnitude was under-estimated by close to one-third by excluding cases without contact history or date of onset of illness. This resulted in a delay of 10 days in which an epidemic could have been recognized for containment. With any outbreak of unknown origin, there will be a paucity of crucial epidemiological data, including the significance of asymptomatic infection, an accurate incubation period, the infectivity and likelihood of person-to-person spread and changes in clinical presentation. The rapid decline in reports of contact history should strongly suggest that strict application of a current case definition could under-estimate the magnitude of the epidemic and efficacy of interventions. To fulfil the criteria of \u2018contact history\u2019, such contact would have had to occur between 1 and 16 days previously.14 The dramatic decline in contact history may be caused by: (1) failure by healthcare workers to elicit contact history; (2) burden of recall of a protracted incubation period (up to 2 weeks); (3) infectivity of the agent improving enabling spread via asymptomatic cases; and (4) spread through casual environmental contamination.",
