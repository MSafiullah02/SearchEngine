The proportion of severe forms among pregnant women thus seems comparable with the general population. Young women can compensate for deterioration in respiratory function and are able to maintain normal oxygen saturations before they then suddenly decompensate. A rise in the respiratory rate may indicate deterioration in respiratory function. Early multidisciplinary discussion should be early organised to determine the adequate location and level of care for both mother and foetal-neonatal management. Escalation in therapy may be offered with the same cautiousness and supervision than in the non-pregnant patients (high-flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventilation\u2026) to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation 19 .

Indeed, in the severe form of the disease at least, birth should occur rapidly, in order to facilitate mother's care. The difficulty in decision-making arises when termination of pregnancy can lead to extreme premature birth. Decision for delivery cannot simply follow guidelines: it has to be discussed on a case-by-case basis, within a multidisciplinary team, weighting benefits and risks on an individual basis. This team should involve obstetricians, obstetrics anaesthetists, intensivists, neonatologists, the patient and her partner when possible. This decision should be re-evaluated regularly, according to the clinical evolution of the mother and to the gestational age. Indication of foetal extraction must not occur too soon (otherwise producing extreme prematurity whereas there is a chance that maternal condition will remain stable), nor too late (otherwise transport to the theatre and surgery can decompensate a very instable maternal condition). In our opinion, intubation itself and low dose catecholamine is not definitely an indication of foetal extraction by itself, but when it occurs, it should lead to close and continuous communication between all multidisciplinary team members in order to provide delivery in a timely manner if the situation worsen.",

This time period represents the highest risk of exposure involving direct contact with respiratory droplets during airway management, primarily during tracheal intubation and extubation. Enhanced PPE is required for the procedure with FFP2 mask, face Page 8 of 15 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f shield, gown, and gloves (preferably long gloves). It is important to minimise the number of HCP in the ward, and the procedure must be performed by the most experienced staff. A highly hydrophobic filter is placed between the facemask and the breathing circuit or between facemask and bag. Another filter should be placed on the expiratory line. The anaesthetist should ensure that a closed suction system is readily available before intubation, and should consider videolaryngoscopy rather than direct laryngoscopy to minimise close exposure between staff and patient respiratory tract. After a tight seal preoxygenation with oxygen 100% to avoid aerosol generation of viral respiratory droplets, rapid sequence induction is done as per usual practice. Because cough at intubation is a major cause of viral dissemination, it is important to give a full dose of neuromuscular block and to respect onset time before laryngoscopy. Extubation also exposes staff to a significant risk of contamination. At this time, the number of HCP should be minimal, and FFP2 mask and PPE should be worn by healthcare providers. If it is decided to proceed with extubation at the end of the case, this should be done in the operating theatre while keeping PPE on until after extubation. If manual ventilation is required, only small tidal volumes should be applied.",

Having an indwelling epidural catheter that can be rapidly utilised to initiate epidural anaesthesia is helpful and decreases the chances of exposure for all healthcare workers that might be present if a general anaesthetic were needed.Given the relatively high rate of foetal compromise, continuous electronic foetal monitoring during regional anaesthesia placement of neuraxial labour analgesia should be encouraged.Protecting HCP from virus contamination is particularly challenging in the LDU. In this clinical environment, it is not uncommon to have to go in and out of a labour ward multiple times during the course if labour and delivery (for consent, for neuraxial placement, for top-ups, for hourly evaluation of pain relief or management of maternal hypotension). The risk of contamination exists because prolonged face to face contact occurs while providing information or instructions to the patient before or after epidural placement to reduce the risk of viral transmission, use of contact/droplet protection is recommended (PPE: FFP2 mask, eye protection, gloves and gown) when entering the ward for any anaesthetic intervention, which should be cautiously removed (doffed) when leaving the ward, associated with appropriate hand hygiene after PPE removal. In addition, it is important to avoid the presence of unnecessary people in the labour ward. In some obstetric units, epidural placement by the physician is facilitated by a nurse anaesthetist providing assistance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is recommended to limit the personnel and assistance may be provided by the midwife in charge.",
