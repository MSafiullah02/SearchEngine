Medical applications of closed-loop control can be divided into systems that control a physical variable of the medical device and those that control a physiological variable of the patient [1]. Many medical devices already incorporate device-internal closed-loop control systems. An example is the internal regulation of the fraction of inspired oxygen to the value set by the clinician. If there is some backward interaction between the patient and the medical device, the system can be said to be patient-oriented. The control of airway pressure during pressure-controlled ventilation is such an example, because there is interaction between the device and patient. Here, the controller also focuses on the medical device.",

Firstly, relevant literature was identified from database search combinations of the keywords: closed-loop, control, feedback and automation in combination with ventilation, mechanical ventilation, and artificial ventilation. Secondly, the search was narrowed down to include only systems which used patient-specific physiological variables for the feedback control. The physiological variables can be grouped loosely into oxygen, carbon dioxide, respiratory mechanics, and patient demand. Thirdly, the phase of weaning has so far benefited most from automation and was therefore added as an additional search keyword. Finally, only literature including studies with patients or medium/large animals was included. Extensive additional literature on theoretical approaches and simulative results exists, but these still need to be validated experimentally.",

For most cases, setpoint control is only relevant when the controller is switched on, as it describes the dynamic response of the system until the target is reached. Setpoint changes are rare in the clinical environment. Exemplarily, the SpO2 target may be at 88\u201395% and seldom changes. The disturbance rejection, however, is the true hero during PCLC, as it is concerned with the response of the system to disturbances and bringing the patient back to the target range. Disturbances can take various forms, both internal (worsening illness, lung stiffness, increased CO2 production) and external (disconnection, room temperature). The two goals are shown for an illustrative example in Fig. 3, with a setpoint change at t1 and a disturbance (extreme increase in CO2) at t2.\n",

            "text": "The evolution of automated physiological control can be categorized by two drivers: the control target and the controller design. The control target is dictated on the one hand by the measurements and sensors available, some of which have been described above. On the other hand, changing clinical evidence and guidelines present new control targets. The second driver, controller design, remains an engineering problem and is beyond the scope of this paper. A brief overview is given here only to facilitate understanding. A natural evolution of the complexity of the controllers comes with the use of computers and their increasing computing power, and the detailed modeling of the respiratory system, which is used for controller synthesis and testing. Simple proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controllers were used initially [15, 16]. This summation of PID action is the most common controller used in almost all industries nowadays. The tuning (setting up of this controller) is static, meaning the controller needs to be tuned to every patient. To overcome this, adaptive controllers [17\u201319] can be used, which change their controller parameters to adapt to the patient or scenario. A mathematical model of the system is required for this, but recent advances in modeling respiratory systems have allowed their increased use. The optimal controller attempts to solve an optimization problem, such as minimizing a cost function, in calculating the actuation variable [20]. Model predictive control (MPC) is another example of an advanced controller which uses a dynamic model of the system [21, 22]. It optimizes the current ventilator settings for the current state, while anticipating future events. Finally, there has also been increasing use of fuzzy control [23, 24]. A fuzzy controller is a rule-based control law, in which the linguistic rules (e.g., if-then-else rules) are fuzzified (blurred) in order to make the control more elastic. These systems are popular in the clinical environment, as the language-based expert knowledge of clinicians is transferred into the design of the controller (which is not the case in PID control, for example). More robust controllers may be introduced in the future. These are designed with uncertainty in mind and can control the performance of the system even for the worst case.",

The response dynamics of their system was, however, limited by the slow response time of the sensor. A similar sensor problem caused the system of Coon et al. [29] to oscillate. The continuous intravascular sensors, however, failed to remain commercially available and their use has ceased. Without any clinical alternatives, the control of CO2 was again based on the measurement of etCO2. However, the increasing difference between PaCO2 and etCO2 in the pathological lung requires compensation [20, 28, 30]. Approaches based on first principles to link etCO2 and PaCO2 were presented by Ohlson et al. [30], but the authors could not compensate correctly when a large variation of cardiac output appeared.",
