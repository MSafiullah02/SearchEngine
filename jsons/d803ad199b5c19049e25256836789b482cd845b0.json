Corticosteroids have a proven beneficial role in asthma, croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis), decreasing the risk and severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, interstitial lung disease, hemangioma of trachea, Pulmonary eosinophillic disorders. Role of corticosteroids is controversial in many conditions e.g. idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, bronchiolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hyperplasia of thymus, bronchiolitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration syndromes, atypical pneumonias, laryngeal diphtheria, AIDS, SARS, sarcoidosis, meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pulmonary haemorrhage, bronchitis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia in JRA, histiocytosis, \u03b1-1 antitrypsin deficiency, bordtella pertusis, pulmonary involvement in histiocytosis. However these are used empirically in many of these conditions despite lack of clear evidence in favour. There is concern about their side effects, especially on growth. Systemic steroids are associated with significant adverse effects. Pulmonary conditions have a strategic advantage that inhaled corticosteroids are useful in many of these. Although inhaled preparations of corticosteroids have been developed to maximise effective treatment of lung diseases characterised by inflammation and reduce the frequency of harmful effects, these have not been eliminated. There are situations where only systemic steroids are useful. Clinicians must weigh the benefits against the potential detrimental effects. It is recommended that standard protocols for use of steroids available in literature should be followed, always keeping a watch on the potential hazards of prolonged use.

Lungs are frequently involved and can often progress to pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary sarcoidosis is characterised by a course that is unpredictable, with some patients showing spontaneous resolution while others progress to chronic lung disease including lung fibrosis. It is not possible currently to identify those patients who are in the latter group. Although corticosteroid therapy has been widely observed to alleviate symptoms and improve disease manifestations, efficacy of corticosteroid therapy for lung disease remains controversial. Cochrane review concluded that patients with stage 1 disease (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy alone) do not need treatment with oral steroids, but that those with interstitial lung disease (stages 2 and 3) may show an improvement in CXR and in global scores when treated with oral steroids. There is little evidence that treatment with oral steroids has a beneficial effect on lung function. The available data provides little guidance for the management of this disease after 2 years. There is limited evidence that oral steroids alter disease progression and early treatment alters progression of the disease. 16 There is little evidence for the efficacy of inhaled steroids. It is well recognized that sarcoidosis is also commonly an endobronchial disease and can cause a troublesome cough. Inhaled steroids should, in theory, be beneficial for this symptom, but this is yet to be established in randomised trials. The optimal dose and length of corticosteroid therapy have not been evaluated in randomized, controlled trials. Treatment protocols for children vary modestly, but most suggest initial treatment with 1 mg/ kg/day of prednisolone. Gradual reduction to the maintenance dose should begin when symptoms or manifestations have improved, typically after 4 to 8 weeks. Thus maintenance dose is the lowest dose that controls symptoms, often in the range of 10 to 15 mg given daily or, if possible, every other day. Total duration of therapy is typically at least 6 months. Relapse that occurs during tapering or following completion of therapy may require reinitiating of treatment using similar regimen.",

A dose of 1 mg/kg on alternate days might be considered for upto 24 months but close attention to the occurrence of adverse effects is warranted. 19 Recently, the use of inhaled corticosteroids has increased as well, although it is difficult to discern whether the therapeutic intent is control of asthmatic symptoms or anti-inflammatory therapy directed at the disease process itself. Some studies suggest that such treatment is beneficial, but one small trial was halted when several of the treated patients had new acquisition of P.aeruginosa. 20 Recently Cochrane review found no evidence, to support the practice of prescribing inhaled steroids in CF. They could not confirm that inhaled steroids are beneficial or that they are not associated with harmful effects. Thus while it is possible that a proportion of people with CF with wheezing may respond to inhaled corticosteroids, existing evidence does not support their routine use in all people with CF. Trials of starting inhaled corticosteroids are becoming increasingly difficult in patient population populations, where a high proportion of people are already taking inhaled corticosteroids. 20 In view of this, a multicenter randomized double blind placebo controlled trial assessed the safety of withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). They concluded that stopping ICS is not harmful for patients with CF who have been taking them for some years. It is likely that the majority of patients taking them no longer need to do so. They advocated that prescribing practice of ICS in a CF patient becomes more like that of an asthmatic, justification is needed to start them, reassessment is necessary to see whether they are having an effect and consideration is always given to reduce the dose or stopping them altogether. 21",

The two interventions useful in reducing pulmonary injury, in military tuberculosis, are specific antimicrobial therapy and non-specific antiinflammatory therapy (corticosteroids). Though ATT, as such, cannot be expected to reverse the capillary damage, the supportive therapy with ventilation and steroids may be life saving. Steroid therapy appears to be effective in reducing systemic toxicity and intensity of inflammatory exudative pulmonary response 23 .
