Just a few months later, there are already millions infected worldwide and with borders closed and strict travel bans imposed local transmission patterns are in place in most countries [1] . COVID-19 mortality rate appears to be in the range of 3,4-5,5% [2] , which is significantly higher than that for seasonal flu caused by the influenza virus (1%), but lower than for both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (15%) [3] and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (34%) [4] . At the same time, the COVID-19 transmission rate is much greater than those of MERS or SARS, and poses a real threat to life for a large number of people worldwide, especially, in older patients with other co-morbidities [5] . Thus, in the absence of effective vaccines and treatments, early detection and the ability to define prognostic parameters predicting the course of the disease appear to be of particular interest. lymphocyte reduction [29] . Thus, virus infection of macrophages, firstly, enhances viral spread and, secondly, triggers destructive events in the immune organs such as spleen and LNs. Recent data from the experiments using SARS-CoV-2 capsid or live virus infection of cultured T cell lines (MT-2 and A3.01) provides first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could also infects T cells. However, expression level of ACE2 on T cells is low and, thus, CD147 is considered to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry into T cells [17] .",

Then another protease, Furin, subsequently releases spike fusion peptide, and the virus enters the host cell through an endosomal pathway [18, 30, 31] . Following viral replication, assembly and release, the infected cells may undergo apoptosis or necrosis, triggering the inflammatory response with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of macrophages and Th1 cells, as well as production of IFN\u03b3, IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-22 by neutrophils, Th17 and CD8 + cells. In turn, SARS-CoV-2 infection of recruited immune cells may increase their apoptosis and exacerbate lymphocytosis [32, 33] , and, finally, may lead in some patients to life-threatening conditions, such as respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.",

            "text": "COVID-19 mortality is strongly associated with the development of severe respiratory distress syndrome, which requires invasive ventilation. It is important to identify those patients who are most likely to develop a severe form of the disease as early as possible. Based on the existing statistics, a number of clinical predictors of the disease deterioration and mortality, including the presence of secondary infections, lymphopenia [34] , comorbidities such as cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and cancer [35] , increased cytokine production and serum ferritin [36] have been reported. The other study showed that the elevated serum creatinine, D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, as well as increased white blood cell counts may indicate impending respiratory failure and the need for invasive oxygen supply [37] . Interestingly, in recently published reports elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was proposed as a relevant parameter predicting the unwanted course of the disease and the need for mechanical ventilation [38] [39] [40] . These assumptions are consistent with data from a clinical trial in China that demonstrated on a small number of patients the efficacy of IL-6 neutralization during exacerbation of COVID-19 associated pneumonia [41] (Supplementary Table 1). IL-6 is a cytokine with pleotropic functions ranging from hematopoiesis and metabolic regulation to inflammation, autoimmunity and acute phase response. IL-6 modulates host defense through a number of immune stimulating mechanisms: control of monocytes and their differentiation into macrophages [42] , modulation of antigen-dependent B cell differentiation [43] , increased IgG production by B cells [44] , and promotion of Th2 response by inhibiting Th1 polarization [45] . Several studies revealed strong correlation between IL-6 levels in the serum and the upcoming respiratory failure [46] [47] [48] . It was shown, that even moderately elevated IL-6 levels above 80 pg/ml were sufficient to identify COVID-19 infected patients with a high risk of respiratory failure [37] . Moreover, serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia), which is strongly associated with cytokine storm, is closely correlated with extremely high IL-6 serum levels [47] . It was also suggested that serial measurement of circulating IL-6 might be important in identifying disease progression or, when evaluated immediately after COVID-19 diagnosis confirmation, may predict the upcoming respiratory failure or, alternatively, asymptomatic disease among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [49] .",

Studies, using IL-6-deficient mice, showed that IL-6 ameliorates acute lung injury in influenza A virus (IAV) infection [55] . IL-6deficient mice infected with influenza virus exhibited higher lethality, as well as increased weight loss and fibroblast accumulation in the lungs associated with virus-induced apoptosis of lung epithelial cells and neutrophils [56] indicating that IL-6 may promote repair following virusinduced lung injury [57] .

Th1 cell-derived IFN\u03b3 is essential for effective antiviral immune response. However, IL-6 may inhibit Th1 polarization by stimulating CD4 + cells to differentiate into Th2 cells or by suppressing IFN\u03b3 expression [60, 61] . Moreover, IL-6 promotes Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17A secretion, which, in turn, activates the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules, such as Bcl-XL, favoring survival of virus-infected cells in the model of persistent viral infection [62] . At the same time, IL-17 promotes the migration [63] , and survival [64] of neutrophils which, in turn, contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19-driven ARDS [65] .

Following replication and disengagement of the lung epithelial layer, virus enters the underlying tissues and infects or is being captured by macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils, resulting in further viral spread [29] (Fig. 3 ). At the same time, damaged epitheliocytes release danger molecules which drive the activation of lung epithelium and resident immune cells. Thus, even at the early onset of viral infection, its penetration of the mucosa to the epithelial layer activates the innate immune response. Adaptive immunity is also activated during COVID-19, mainly by antigen presenting dendritic cells, which produce large amounts of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1b and TNF and migrate to the regional lymph nodes to present viral antigen to na\u00efve T cells, pushing their differentiation and migration into the affected tissue [68] . Specific humoral response represented by viral-specific antibody-producing B cells is also in place [69] . Replication of the virus results in further damage of affected organs together with self-boosting immune response manifesting to uncontrolled overexpression of inflammatory mediators in severe cases. Another mechanism driving cytokine storm during viral infections is increased blood vessel permeability which enables infiltration of effector cells, producing additional amounts of inflammatory molecules and exacerbating hyper cytokine production [70] . In addition, leakiness of blood vessels allows virus to spread to other tissues and organs, compromising their functions. Finally, under persistence of inflammatory factors, an increased number of inflammatory exudates and erythrocytes enter the alveoli, resulting in lung damage and respiratory failure syndrome.",

The main source of pathogenic IL-6 appears to be myeloid cells as their number is significantly increased among PBMC [69] and in BALF of severe COVID-19 patients [71] . Myeloid cell recruitment and activation in the lungs is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in SARS-CoV mouse model [72] . Human primary macrophages and dendritic cells can be infected, but they fail to support productive replication of SARS-CoV [73, 74] , unlike alveocytes, in which virus can replicate very quickly. At the same time, SARS-CoV and, apparently, SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages demonstrate up-regulation of IL-6 production and low expression of interferons [29, 73] . Interestingly, patients requiring intensive care and invasive lung ventilation display negative correlation between IL-6, TNF and IL-1b concentrations and CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts [75] , confirming previous studies in animal models, which suggested that cytokine storm actually dampens adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV infection [76] . Moreover, production of IFN\u03b3 by CD4 + T cells tended to be lower in severe as compared to moderate cases, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces lymphopenia with the suppression of antiviral IFN\u03b3 production [36] . Furthermore, it has been suggested that this pathogenic IL-6 is likely to be produced by highly inflammatory macrophages [71] , but not by alveolar macrophages, which are almost absent in the lung aspirates of severely affected patients [77] . At the same time, it should be noted that complete ablation of IL-6 at the very early stages of viral infection may result in depressed Tfh cell maturation and delayed antiviral antibody response [78] .",

COVID-19 patients also show significant changes in coagulative status (i.e. low platelet count, increased D-dimer, fibrinogen levels) and dysfunction of microvessels in pulmonary circulation [82, 83] , thus, thrombosis of the pulmonary capillaries is believed to contribute to rapidly developing hypoxia. The role of IL-6 in inflammatory hypercoagulation is controversial: IL-6 can increase the rate of fibrotic clot formation in whole blood, but the effect is less pronounced than it is shown for IL-1 or IL-8 [84] . On the other hand, IL-6 is important for thrombus formation being a regulator of MMPs and other thrombolysisassociated genes in macrophages [85] .",

Serum TNF levels were found to be elevated in severely affected COVID-19 patients [34] . Previously, it was shown for SARS-CoV that its spike protein is able to modulate TNF converting enzyme (TACE)-dependent shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain [88] . TACE expression is coupled to TNF production. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the use of TNF inhibitors may also show some efficacy in preventing viral entry [89] , as well as in decreasing immunopathology associated mortality, as it was shown in preclinical studies in mice infected with severe respiratory syncytial virus [90] . Moreover, anti-TNF therapy was effective in decreasing the IL-6 and IL-1b serum levels in lethal bacteremia, suggesting that such treatment may provide complex anti-inflammatory effect [91] . Data obtained from COVID-19 infected patients with inflammatory bowel diseases undergoing anti-TNF therapy support safety of such intervention in the context of SARS-CoV-2 treatment [92, 93] . These findings argue for a potentially protective effect of TNF inhibition in COVID-19 and further studies are needed to address this possibility.",

            "text": "Angiotensin II is known to significantly increase the expression of IL-6 in a dosedependent manner [105] through pleiotropic activation of NF-kB transcription factors [106] , [107] . Angiotensin 1 receptor downstream activation of NADPH oxidase results in elevated oxidative stress, in particularly, superoxide that activates transcriptional mechanisms that directly promotes IL-6 gene expression. In turn, plasma IL-6 concentrations correlate with blood pressure, plasma Angiotensin II levels and vascular hypertrophy, suggesting an important role of IL-6 in the development and maintenance of hypertension, specifically, that mediated by Angiotensin II [108, 109] . IL-6 promotes Angiotensin 1 receptor expression sensitizing the vascular wall to angiotensin II-dependent signaling mechanisms. Activated cells can release J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cytokines, including IL-6, which promote expression of adhesion molecules and induce endothelial activation, inflammatory cell infiltration and vascular inflammation [110] . This further drives oxidative stress and IL-6 expression. Therefore, it is plausible that IL-6 and Angiotensin II activate each other through a positive feedback mechanism. In support of this hypothesis, ACE2 protects against lethal avian influenza A H5N1 infection [111] through prevention of oxidative stress and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Moreover, it was recently reported that in COVID-19 patients with hypertension Angiotensin receptor blockade attenuated the inflammatory response, possibly through IL-6 inhibition [102, 112] . Taking together, Angiotensin II accumulation due to SARS-CoV-2-mediated ACE2 downregulation may cause Angiotensin 1 receptor downstream activation of NADPH oxidase, which, in turn, leads to elevated ROS production and to induction of transcriptional mechanisms that directly promote IL-6 expression, implicated in inflammation-induced injury and immunopathology.",

It is estimated that mortality rate of those with COVID-19 and diabetes is about 16% [8] to 35% [113] . IL-6 is known for its dual role in autoimmune diabetes, as it is involved in the development of insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction and, at the same time, has anti-inflammatory effects and improves glucose metabolism [114] . Recent clinical data demonstrates significantly elevated systemic IL-6 in COVID-19 patients with diabetes as compared to those without diabetes [115] . COVID-19 may exacerbate the pre-existing diabetes, since its entry site, ACE2, is expressed in the pancreas, with a potential role in the development of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion [116] . IL-6 may be the link between diabetes and severe COVID-19 outcomes through its ability to modulate T cell response. Some indirect evidence to support this comes from mouse studies of closely related MERS-CoV infection demonstrating that abnormal elevation of IL-17A produced by IL-6-dependent Th17 cells exacerbates disease severity in diabetic mice [117] . Consistent with that finding, patients with COVID-19 have a higher proportion of Th17 cells in the blood [118] , suggesting that diabetics due to improper activation of Th1 and Th17 cells may have a compromised anti-viral immune response [31] .",

Myofibroblasts, which increase in number with age, express high levels of ACE2 [124] , thus, myofibroblasts are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and elderly people, bearing higher proportion of myofibroblasts, might be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection (reviewed in [125] ). IL-6 is a critical inflammatory regulator of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [126] . Therefore, IL-6 overexpression may correlate both with senescent status of cells and tissues, as well as with increased expression of ACE2. In line with this idea, hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, which is now approved in some countries for COVID-19 treatment, effectively reduced the salivary and serum levels of IL-6 in patients with Sjorgen's syndrome [127] . Moreover, azithromycin, prescribed together with hydroxychloroquine, can target and selectively remove senescent cells [128] and, thus, provide anti-fibrotic activity by protecting the lungs from inflammation-induced injury [129, 130] .",

In line with that, studies in mice have established that cigarette smoke can trigger the expansion of a subpopulation of respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner [139] . Patients with COPD, as well as active smokers, have increased ACE2 expression in the lungs [140] , which may potentially explain a fourfold increased risk of adverse development and severe outcome of COVID-19 [141, 142] .

Examination of factors, predisposing to severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, revealed, that 19.2% of patients with severe disease were smokers [143] . On the other hand, preliminary meta-analysis based on Chinese patients suggest that active smoking was not associated with the severity of COVID-19 [144] , indicating that impact of smoking on COVID-19 progression is controversial and requires further assessment.",

However, the prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan study was markedly lower (0,9%) than that reported in the adult population of Wuhan (6,4%) [143] . One possible explanation is a shift toward Th2-type immune response in asthmatics as opposed to Th1-associated inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection [118] . Recent study reveals that TMRSS2 expression in upper respiratory tract correlates positively with type 2 response genes, especially with IL-13, whereas ACE2 expression is suppressed by IL-13. Considering low numbers of cells co-expressing these proteases in the upper respiratory tract, it has been proposed that in the context of IL-13-dependent reduction in ACE2 expression allergy should promote resistance to infection [145] . In line with this, it was shown that ACE2 expression is decreased in nasal and bronchial epithelium of allergic individuals following allergen challenge, suggesting, that asthma-associated immune response actually protects from COVID-19-induced pathology [146] . Nevertheless, further studies are required to reveal the impact of COVID-19 severity in patients with preexisting asthma.",

Similar data on association of gender with poorer prognosis for males were obtained earlier for SARS-CoV [148] , [149] and MERS-CoV [150, 151] . In connection to SARS-CoV-2, the X-linked ACE2 gene is of a particular interest. Significant fraction of genes encoded on the X chromosome undergo dosage compensation, however, ACE2 is located at Xp22, i.e. the area in which genes may escape from X chromosome inactivation [152] , possibly contributing to gender disparity in disease susceptibility. Gender differences in immune responses are known to depend not only on genetic, but also on endocrine factors [153, 154] . High doses of estradiol acting through estrogen receptors decrease production of proinflammatory cytokines via suppressing NF-kB signaling pathway [155] . In relation to COVID-19 the effects of estrogens on IL-6 and on disease progression is of particular interest. Estrogen may suppress LPS-mediated IL-6 expression in mouse macrophages by both blocking of NF-kB activation [155, 156] and inhibiting p38 MAPK phosphorylation [156] . Furthermore, downregulation of IL-6 expression in Kupffer cells appears to be ER\u03b1-dependent [157] . Overall, immunomodulatory effects of estrogens may contribute to decreased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in women and this question requires further study.",

This is characterized by alveolar epithelial cell injury, recruitment and activation of fibroblasts and subsequent production of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the presence of specifically activated immune cells. Fibrosis develops as an exaggerated repair process following injury associated with abnormal immune response leading to chronic progressive disease [160] . Histological examination of lung biopsies from COVID-19 patients show massive apoptosis of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, fibromyxoid exudates [161] which are manifestations that are characteristic for ARDS and represent key events preceding development of fibrosis (reviewed in [162] ). Significant pro-fibrotic M2-like SPP1 + macrophage infiltration was also described for COVID-19 correlating with the disease severity [71] . Damage to the epithelial layer caused by the virus further attracts various immune cells participating in inflammation-repair balance (monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes and T cells). In addition, some viral components, such as N-protein and papain-like protease, can directly stimulate production of TGF-\u03b2, one of the pro-fibrotic hallmarks in respiratory epithelium, similar to what has previously been reported for SARS-CoV [163, 164] .",

            "text": "The role of IL-6 had been extensively studied in bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in mice. Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic antibiotic which causes damage of tissues lacking bleomycin hydrolase, predominantly, in the lungs [165] . Mice with genetic ablation of IL-6 were characterized by impaired fibrosis [166] . However, in the same model mice with pharmacological rather than genetic inhibition of IL-6 demonstrated opposing phenotypes depending on the phase of inflammation-repair cycle. Specifically, IL-6 neutralization at the early inflammatory phase (day 2 following bleomycin-induced lung injury) resulted in apoptosis of pneumocytes, which further contributed to pulmonary fibrosis, whereas IL-6 blockade at the early fibrotic stage (day 8 following bleomycin-induced lung injury) significantly ameliorated lung fibrosis [167] . Interestingly, treatment of mice with recombinant soluble gp130Fc at the late stage of chronic bleomycin model attenuated lung fibrosis, emphasizing the importance of sIL-6Ra and IL-6 trans-signaling in mediating this condition [168] . It was further suggested that M2like infiltrating macrophages are the major source of soluble IL-6Ra in fibrotic foci, whereas pulmonary fibroblasts are the recipient cells, which proliferate and produce extracellular matrix under trans-IL-6 activation. Finally, overexpression of IL-6 in respiratory tract mediated by adenoviral vectors also resulted in the exacerbation of fibrosis and was associated with increased levels of M2-macrophages with pro-fibrotic features [169] . These pro-fibrotic macrophages are also characterized by increased IL-6Ra expression [168] . ACE2 expression is reported for lung, heart, kidney, intestine, liver and brain. Thus, similar fibrosis-associated complications should be expected, not just for respiratory tract, but also for other tissues and organs in correlation with viral load and severity of cytokine release syndrome. Summarizing the data available at the moment from infection-free experimental models of fibrosis, one can conclude that IL-6 may affect fibroblast proliferation and functions directly or through potentiation of a distinct macrophage phenotype. Taking into account the importance of this cytokine at the repair stage, anti-IL-6 therapy may prove beneficial not only in acute phase, but also in subacute proliferative phase of COVID-19-related ARDS.",

ACE2 expression in CNS is attributed to the nuclei in brain stem and is associated with cardio-respiratory control [171, 172] . Recent study based on scRNA sequencing suggests co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in olfactory epithelial cells, but not in mature olfactory sensory neurons, which were initially considered as the most obvious target population for the virus in CNS [173] . Even without the understanding of the exact mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 penetration and distribution in CNS, it should be noted that as a result of the disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and cytokine storm caused by infection, blood-brain-barrier permeability is significantly increased, which can lead to negative consequences for CNS functioning [174, 175] .",

SARS-CoV-2-induced immunopathology exhibits features of systemic hyper-inflammation reminiscent both of cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome and secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis [177] . Since overexpression of IL-6 appears to be associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes, neutralizing antibodies used to treat a number of autoimmune diseases by targeting exacerbated inflammatory immune response of the host may provide a life-saving approach by preventing the cytokine release syndrome. In line with that, patients responding to CD19 CAR T cell therapy experience cytokine release syndrome [178] , which is well managed by IL-6 neutralizing antibodies [179] . In a non-randomized, open-label clinical trial, 21 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 were treated with a single dose of Tocilizumab, in addition to routine therapy [180] . 90% of patients recovered, suggesting that anti-IL-6 might be a powerful potential rescue therapy in managing acute respiratory distress syndrome of COVID-19 and inhibiting the most adverse outcome. Peripheral mononuclear cell scRNA-seq profiling data obtained from these patients indicate that treatment with Tocilizumab does not reduce the number of cytotoxic CD8 + and plasma B cells, thus, does not interfere with robust adaptive immune response [69] . Preliminary data from 21 patients with COVID-19 who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and participated in a compassionate-use program at Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo, Italy, indicate that intravenous introduction of Siltuximab reduced C-reactive protein level in all patients and significantly improved clinical conditions with a reduced need for ventilation in 33% of patients. 43% of patients showed stabilization of their conditions, and 24% of patients experienced a worsening of the disease and required intubation [181] .",

Despite the fact that humanity experienced viral infections causing deadly pneumonia twice in the past 20 years, there are still no drugs specific for coronaviruses. The evidence discussed in this review suggests that for patients with risk factors, especially those with high systemic levels of IL-6, clinically approved neutralizing antibodies against IL-6 or its receptor, IL-6R, in combination with standard treatment protocols may provide benefit. Gaining a deeper understanding of the factors that affect the immune response and mechanistic link of these factors to disease severity is crucial for effective clinical management of COVID-19 in severely affected patients.",

After the virions are released, they can infect or are being captured by macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. At the same time, damaged epithelial cells produce alarmins, which are sensed by the neighboring epithelial and myeloid cells. All these events lead to release of proinflammatory cytokines, increase of alveolar vessel permeability and cell recruitment to the site of infection, forming positive loop for pathological activation of IL-6, IL-1, TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines. Due to high permeability of pulmonary vessels under inflammatory conditions, SARS-CoV-2 can inseminate distant ACE2-expressing tissues (intestine, kidney, pancreas), and trigger burst of inflammation at distant sites. Ain healthy state pro-inflammatory signaling of Angiotensin II via Angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) is stabilized by Angiotensin 1-7 (ACE2-Angiotensin I proteolysis product) signaling via Mas receptor (MasR) that has anti-inflammatory effect.Bvirus-mediated down-regulation of ACE2 leads to Angiotensin II accumulation in the absence of Angiotensin 1-7 and acceleration of its proinflammatory effect. AT1R downstream activation of NADPH oxidase results in elevated ROS directly promoting IL-6 expression. In its turn, IL-6 can positively regulate AT1R levels. Thus, by acting together these processes J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f exacerbate hypertension, edema, infiltration of immune cells and inflammation in COVID-19 affected lungs.",
