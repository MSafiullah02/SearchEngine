            "text": "It can be assumed that patients with DM are more likely to be older than those without DM and advancing age has consistently been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19, however, most of the aforementioned studies did not adjust for age. Nevertheless, diabetes has been uniformly reported to be associated with poor prognosis in other viral infections, notably seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza A H1N1 (2009), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [5] [6] [7] [8] . Multiple explanations can be put forward for this apparent association between pre-existing DM and COVID-19 severity. Innate immunity, the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2, is inevitably compromised in patients with uncontrolled DM thereby allowing unhindered proliferation of the pathogen within the host [9] . Even short-term hyperglycemia has been shown to transiently stun the innate immune system [10] . Moreover, DM is characterized by exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response, notably interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108132 0168-8227/\u00d3 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-a, in the absence of appropriate immunostimulation; this may be further exaggerated in response to a stimulus as seen in patients with COVID-19 complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [9] . The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the association between DM and COVID-19 is plausible. ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein that is constitutively expressed by the epithelial cells of the lungs, kidney, intestine and blood vessels. In normal physiology, ACE2 breaks down angiotensin-II and to a lesser extent, angiotensin-I to smaller peptides, angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin (1-9), respectively [11] . ACE2/Ang (1-7) system plays an important anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant role protecting the lung against ARDS; indeed ACE2 has been shown to be protective against lethal avian influenza A H5N1 infection [12] . ACE2 expression is reduced in patients with DM possibly due to glycosylation; this might explain the increased predisposition to severe lung injury and ARDS with COVID-19 [4, 11] .",

            "text": "Strange it might sound, even overexpression of ACE2 would be counterproductive in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 as a receptor for entry into the host pneumocytes [13] . Herein comes the confounding role of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), drugs that are so widely used in DM. The expression of ACE2 is markedly increased in patients with DM (and hypertension) on ACEi or ARBs as an adaptive response to counteract the elevated levels of Ang-II and Ang-I. Thus, use of ACE2-stimulating drugs would facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into pneumocytes and consequently might result in more severe and fatal disease [14] . Amongst others, pioglitazone and liraglutide have also been shown to be associated with ACE2 upregulation in animal studies [14, 15] . Unfortunately, none of the studies have taken into account the baseline treatment. Furthermore, a recently concluded study showed that severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of hypokalemia that resulted from renal potas-sium wasting. This can be explained by downregulation of ACE2 following viral intrusion resulting in decreased degradation of angiotensin-II, increased aldosterone secretion and subsequent increased urinary potassium loss. Infact early normalization of serum potassium has been proposed to be a predictor of good prognosis in COVID-19 [16] . Thus, ACE2 overexpression, while facilitating entry of SARS-CoV-2, is unable to protect against lung injury as the enzyme gets degraded by the virus (see Fig. 1 ).",

The prevalence of DM in India is 7.3% [17] , thereby predisposing a large section of the community to COVID-19 and its complications. Hence it is advisable that community-dwelling residents having underlying DM take extra precautions not to contract the virus. Social distancing, strict hand and respiratory hygiene are the need of the hour. People with DM should ensure good glucose control as improvement in glycemia does boost host immune response [9] . Although not recommended due to lack of robust data, use of ACEi/ ARBs/thiazolidinediones/liraglutide merits reconsideration in patients with DM during this outbreak.",
