Extensive research is being conducted across the globe to identify therapeutic agents against the SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a powerful and efficient computational strategy by combining machine learning (ML) based models and high-fidelity ensemble docking simulations to enable rapid screening of possible therapeutic molecules (or ligands). Our screening is based on the binding affinity to either the isolated SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at its host receptor region or to the Sprotein-human ACE2 interface complex, thereby potentially limiting and/or disrupting the host-virus interactions. We first apply our screening strategy to two drug datasets (CureFFI and DrugCentral) to identify hundreds of ligands that bind strongly to the aforementioned two systems. Candidate ligands were then validated by all atom docking simulations. The validated ML models were subsequently used to screen a large bio-molecule dataset (with nearly a million entries) to provide a rank-ordered list of \u223c19,000 potentially useful compounds for further validation. Overall, this work not only expands our knowledge of small-molecule treatment against COVID-19, but also provides an efficient pathway to perform high-throughput computational drug screening by combining quick ML surrogate models with expensive high-fidelity simulations, for accelerating the therapeutic cure of diseases.",

It has been hypothesized that compounds that can reduce interactions between S-protein:ACE2 receptors could limit viral recognition of the host (human) cells and/or disrupt the host-virus interactions. To this end, Smith et al. [8] recently conducted virtual high-throughput screening of nearly 9000 small-molecules that bind strongly to either 1) the isolated S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 at its host receptor region (thus, hindering the viral recognition of the host cells) or 2) to the S-protein:human ACE2 receptor interface (thus, reducing the host-virus interactions). They successfully identified 77 ligands (24 of which have regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, or similar agencies) that satisfied one of the above two criteria. Despite the vast chemical space (millions to billions of biomolecules) that can be potentially explored, they were severely limited by the number of candidate compounds (nearly 9000) that were considered in their work owing to the high computational cost of the ensemble docking simulations employed in their methodology.",

We use the binding affinities (or their Vina scores) of the ligand to the S-protein:ACE2 interface complex and the isolated S-protein as the screening criteria to identify promising candidates using our ML models. The ML models were applied to two drug datasets, namely, CureFFI and DrugCentral containing \u223c1500 and \u223c4000 ligands present in known drugs, respectively. We also deploy the ML model to rapidly screen through a huge BindingDB dataset that contains over millions of small bio-molecules, to identify candidates that bind strongly to either the isolated S-protein or the S-protein:human ACE2 receptor interface complex.",

Our work is based on combining ML methods with ensemble docking simulations to screen promising ligands. Two independent random forest (RF) regression models were trained to quickly estimate the Vina scores of a given candidate drug molecule (or ligand) for the isolated S-protein and the S-protein:human ACE2 receptor interface using the datasets provided by Smith et al. [8] . The Vina score is a hybrid (empirical and knowledge-based) scoring function that ranks molecular conformations and predicts the free energy of binding based on intermolecular contributions (e.g., steric, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding, etc.) [13] . A set of hierarchical descriptors (or features/fingerprints) that capture different geometric and chemical information at multiple length-scales (atomic and morphological) were used to represent the molecules for successful application of the ML models. The models were validated by monitoring their performance on the validation set, and against ensemble docking simulations for hundreds of promising candidate ligands. Overall, we identified several hundreds of new ligand candidates with potential therapeutic ability against COVID-19, 75 of which are FDA approved. A list of \u223c19,000 bio-molecules (from BindingDB dataset) satisfying the same screening criteria is also provided using the developed ML models. Based on the feature importance revealed by the ML models, we also provide analysis of key chemical trends that are common across the identified promising candidates. We note that this work not only expands our knowledge of potential small-molecule treatment against COVID-19, but also provides a powerful and efficient pathway, i.e., training ML on results of computationally expensive simulations, using ML to cast a wider net, down-selection followed by targeted computational simulations, and finally chemical guidelines, for accelerating the therapeutic cure of other diseases.",

These ML models were next used to make Vina score predictions for the 1495 FDA approved drugs from CureFFI database, and 3967 other drugs from DrugCentral database. 187 candidate ligands with significantly low Vina score predictions (or high binding affinity) for both the S-protein and S-protein:ACE2 interface systems were screened for further validations using ensemble docking simulations. Our ML predictions were found to be in good agreement with the expensive docking simulations, thus, validating the developed ML model for its accurate Vina score predictions and identifying several tens of new FDA approved (or otherwise) ligands with high binding affinity to both the S-protein and S-protein:ACE2 interface. With the ML models validated, we apply them to an extensive small bio-molecule dataset, i.e., BindingDB with over millions of entries and screen many more potential candidates.

Each of the datasets contains 9127 molecules from the SWEETLEAD database [15] along with their SMILES representations, which were used as input for our fingerprinting algorithm. For many molecules the Vina scores were reported to be extremely high (as much as 1,000,000 kcal/mol), while those with favorable binding energetics have Vina scores roughly in the -7 to 0 kcal/mol range. To remove such skewness in the data and train our models geared towards identifying favorable molecules with lower Vina scores, data points with only negative Vina scores were considered in this study. Further for a few cases, the SMILES representation could not be resolved correctly and were filtered out. Overall, this results in 5478 and 8120 data points (from the original number of 9127) for the S-protein:ACE2 interface and the isolated S-protein system, respectively. Henceforth, we refer to this cleaned dataset as the Smith dataset.",

The features should uniquely represent a molecule, and be readily available for new cases. Based on our past experience on fingerprinting organic materials including polymers [14] , three hierarchical levels of features were considered capturing different geometric and chemical information about ligands at multiple length-scales. At the atomic scale, a count of a predefined set of motifs is included. The motifs are specified by the generic label \"A i B j C k \", representing an i-fold coordinated A atom, a j-fold coordinated B atom, and a k-fold coordinated C atom, connected in the specified order. For example, N3-C3-C4 represents a threefold coordinated N, a three-fold coordinated carbon and a four-fold coordinated carbon [16] At a slightly larger length-scale, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) descriptors, often used in chemical and biological sciences, and implemented in the RDKit Python library, were used [17, 18, 19] . Lastly, at the highest length-scale, 'morphological descriptors', such as length of the largest side-chain, shortest topological distance between rings, etc. were considered. More details on the different hierarchical descriptors can be found in our previous works [14] .",

Since, the true Vina scores of these ligands is not known, here we only show their ML predictions. It has been hypothesized that a ligand could be effective against coronavirus if it either form S-protein:ACE2 interface-ligand binding complexes (low S-protein:ACE2 Vina score) to disrupt the host-virus interaction, or it binds to the receptor recognition region of the S-protein (low S-protein Vina score) to reduce viral recognition of the host.

For comparison, results from the Smith dataset are also included. The purpose of these simulations was three-fold. First, a more accurate estimate of the Vina scores was obtained from these high-fidelity computations for the identified promising candidates; second, they provided new data points for further validation of the ML models, and lastly, for the 29 common candidate ligands (common to our top list and that of Smith), they help us validate our simulations against the simulations performed in the Smith paper [8] . From Figure 4 its evident that the ML models indeed helped us screen candidates with favorable Vina scores; almost all screened candidates can be seen to be below the ML screening criteria line (dashed line), while only 12 of the identified 187 candidates were found to have Vina scores greater than 0 and did not show any binding affinity to the S-protein:ACE2 interface complex-such cases have relatively much higher Vina score (>10) and are excluded from the plots for better readability. Thus, 175 of the 187 screened candidates were indeed favorable. In comparison, Smith et al. have to do expensive docking simulations for a large set of candidates, with many falling outside the screening boundary. This not only captures the efficiency of the procedure adopted here, i.e., the use of cheap surrogate models for quick screening followed by expensive high-fidelity docking simulations for validation, but also provides further validation of the prediction accuracy of the developed ML models. Parity plots directly comparing the Vina score predictions from the ML models against their respective docking simulation results are also provided in SI. Example illustrations of the S-protein:ACE2 interface-ligand complex for the top candidates are also included in the SI. More importantly, our trained ML model predicts several ligands (including several FDA approved active ingredients) with favorable Vina scores.

For instance, although the binding energy of a ligand is the primary criterion and related to the binding affinity measured from the AutoDock simulations based on free energy, other metrics developed by Lipinski and co-workers [25, 26] also have certain implications on the efficacy of the drug, and could be used to for further screening of the identified candidates. A ligand is most likely to have poor absorption when its n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) is >5, its molecular weight (MW) is >500, the number of H-bond donors is >5 and the number of H-bond acceptors is >10. Figure 6 shows the log P of the top 50 candidates identified (based on lowest value of Vina scores) from the CureFFI and DrugCentral databases. Most of the top 50 ligands can be seen to have log P <5, which is consistent with Lipinski rules of five. Further, the molecular weights of the compounds are lower than 500 Da, as provided in SI along with other properties, such as Henry's constant, and number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors.",

For a drug to be up-taken by the cellular membrane, it is desirable for the drug to be soluble in water. The more negative the Henry's constant the more soluble is the drug in aqueous phase. However, a balance between desirable partitioning between the membrane and aqueous phase is generally sought. Thus, as presented in Table 1 , the identified top candidates continue to satisfy all of the above additional criteria. Importantly, we note that more such constraints can be introduced in future work to further screen desirable candidate ligands. For instance, molecules with log P below 0 are known to have high affinity towards the aqueous media and are poorly absorbed by the lipid bilayer of the cellular membranes. Many of the top candidates can be seen to fall under this category, for e.g., Amiloride which has a log P of \u22121.45 is water friendly and used as water-pills/diuretic. Nitrofurantoin with log P of \u22120.47 is used to treat urinary tract infections.",

In this regard, the developed RF models can be used to identify important features/descriptors utilized in this work. In RF, the relative importance of a feature can be defined using the the relative rank (or depth) of that feature when used as a decision node in a tree, since features used at the top of a tree contribute towards the final prediction for a larger fraction of the input samples. Based on this philosophy, we provide a list of top 20 features that were found to be most relevant for the S-protein and the S-protein:ACE2 interface models in SI. Importantly, we found that the 2 \u03c7 n score of a molecule is very well (with Pearson correlation coefficient, R 2 = -0.67) correlated with its S-protein Vina score; higher the 2 \u03c7 n score, lower is the Vina score of the molecule:S-protein complex [27, 19] . A variety of molecular quantum numbers (MQNs) were also found be highly relevant-those that captured the number of 5 or 6 membered rings, the topological surface area, cyclic trivalent and tetravalent nodes, nodes and edges shared by more than 2 rings. Count of aliphatic rings was also among important descriptors.",

Nearly 19,000 molecules were found to satisfy the earlier chosen screening criteria (see SI for the complete list), and a few exemplary cases are illustrated in Figure 7 (b). These results clearly demonstrate the power and efficiency of using surrogate models for preliminary screening. For instance, the docking simulations for the identified 187 candidate active ingredients were completed in a period of around 2 days. In contrast, Vina score predictions from the ML model for the entire BindingDB dataset were obtained within a day using similar computational resources, including the time required for fingerprinting and making the model predictions. Evidently, our ML strategy is efficiently able to screen millions of candidate biomolecules and make useful suggestions to aid the decision making process for expert biologists and medical professionals. More robust high-fidelity computations, followed by synthesis and trial experiments should be performed to confirm the validity of these selected molecules.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we present an efficient virtual screening strategy to identify ligands that can potentially limit and/or disrupt the host-virus interactions. Our hypothesis is that ligands that bind strongly to the isolated SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at its host(human) receptor region and to the Sprotein-human ACE2 interface complex are likely to be most effective. Our high-throughput screening strategy is based on using a combination of machine learning (ML) and high-fidelity docking simulations to identify candidates that display such high binding affinities. We first train ML on results of computationally expensive simulations, and subsequently use the validated ML to search a much larger chemical space (\u223c1000's of FDA approved ligands and subsequently \u223cmillions of biomolecules). We down-select based on ML predicted Vina scores, and finally mine chemical guidelines to accelerate the therapeutic cure of diseases. Two random forest models were trained to quickly predict Vina scores of molecules with isolated S-protein and Sprotein:human ACE2 interface complex, using dataset from the past work. To train the ML models, a comprehensive set of chemical features was compiled, based on our past experience on fingerprinting organic materials, to capture geometric and chemical information about ligands at multiple length-scales. The ML models were first used to screen 187 ligands from two drug datasets (CureFFI and DrugCentral), 175 of which were indeed found to bind strongly to the isolated S-protein and to the Sprotein-human ACE2 interface complex using the expensive AutoDock simulations. This not only validates the accuracy of the ML models developed here, but also helped to identify 75 promising FDA approved ligands. Many of the identified top ligands were also found to satisfy Lipinski's rule of five. With the ML models validated, we used them to screen \u223c19,000 candidates from a large dataset of bio-molecules (\u223c 1 million) from the BindingDB dataset. A rank-ordered list of promising candidates from the different datasets are provided for further theoretical or experimental validation. ",
