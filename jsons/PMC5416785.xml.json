            "text": "The number of immunocompromised patients has increased during the past few decades, reflecting increased use of immunosuppressive medications, and improved diagnostic techniques. The important causes of immunosuppression are solid organ transplantation, hematopoietic stem cells transplantation, cancer therapy, HIV infection, autoimmune diseases, primary immunodeficiencies, long-term steroid use, diabetes mellitus, and chronic debilitating illness.[12] The immunocompromised patients are more prone to various infections as compared to the immunocompetent ones. The organisms which are of little native virulence in the immunocompetent, can cause life-threatening complications in immunocompromised. Out of all, the infectious complications, respiratory complications are the most common because lungs can be a portal of entry for wide range of microorganisms. Respiratory infections comprise about 75% of pulmonary complications and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients.[34] The number of pathogens capable of causing the pulmonary infections is increasing. Earlier, only the bacterial pathogens were considered significant, but now, the atypical pathogens and viruses are increasingly being documented.[5] Pathogens of greatest concern in immunocompromised are Pneumocystis jirovecii and cytomegalovirus (CMV).[6] P. jirovecii is primarily associated with HIV infection but clusters of cases have also been seen in solid organ transplant recipients and patients with hematological malignancies.[789] Coinfections are common in the immunocompromised. CMV pneumonitis often develops in association with other causes of pneumonia, especially the P. jirovecii. Subsequent secondary bacterial pneumonia can also develop.[10] Besides these two, other important viral causes of respiratory infections in immunocompromised are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (Flu), adenovirus (AdV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza virus, and human rhinovirus.[111213] Prompt accurate diagnosis of pulmonary infections by these pathogens is crucial not only because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with them but also to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Respiratory illness by viruses remains under diagnosed, the main reason being the nonspecific clinical presentation and difficult diagnosis. Now in recent years, with the introduction of molecular-based tests, diagnostic yield of viruses have improved up to 35%.[14] These nucleic acid amplification tests are highly sensitive and rapid. With the multiplex technology, it is easier to identify the coinfections also. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) may not only facilitate the optimal clinical management of immunocompromised patients but also prevent their transmission.[15] The present study was done to evaluate the performance of respiratory MPCR on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in immunocompromised patients admitted with respiratory illness.",

MPCR is targeting the 33 pathogens simultaneously, but aerobic culture done in routine can only identify the easily cultivable bacteria. Hence, if MPCR is routinely implemented in the diagnostic protocol of respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients, causative pathogen will be identified in significantly higher number of patients. Baudel et al. showed similar type of results where MPCR was positive in 66%, and culture was positive in only 40% of patients.[16] Nevertheless, it has some limitations. First, it cannot quantify the pathogen load so it is difficult to differentiate colonization from infection. Second, it cannot give the antibiotic sensitivity for which we have to rely on culture only. But still, it is a highly sensitive tool in immunocompromised patients where traditional methods for diagnosis of virus and atypical organisms are very cumbersome, and bacteria are also difficult to recover even in lung biopsy.[17]",

The definitive diagnosis is difficult as it requires transbronchial or open lung biopsy specimen. It is too risky to be performed routinely in all clinically suspected patients. Culture is also difficult to interpret and time-consuming. Now, in recent years, interest is focused on rapid molecular techniques. PCR is also not confirmatory as it can represent either viral shedding or pulmonary disease. However, if done in clinically suspected immunocompromised patients, it is most sensitive and rapid method. In our study, 21% of patients were positive for CMV DNA in BAL. Chemaly et al. have found that high CMV viral load in BAL in lung transplant recipients is strongly associated with CMV pneumonitis.[29] Our test has limitations as it was not quantitative. To obviate this, we have considered only those BAL positive for CMV DNA which were having cycling threshold value below 30. We correlated it with CMV viral load in the blood samples, and 86.3% of patients were also positive for CMV DNA in blood sample with a mean of 575,650 DNA copies/ml. According to various studies, CMV DNA in blood correlates well with CMV pneumonitis.[293031] CMV DNA detection in BAL can give useful information if done in clinically suspected immunocompromised patients.",

A variable range from 14% to 38% has been reported in the previous studies.[3233] Most frequent pathogens associated with mixed infections were CMV and P. jirovecii. This is in concordance with several published studies.[273435] Mortality was significantly higher in patients with mixed infections as compared to other categories. Previous studies have shown the variable outcome among patients with mixed infections. Some showing more severe clinical disease while other showing no association. Mortalities were not compared significantly in these studies as total number of deaths was less.[3233363738] Our study differs in that we only studied immunocompromised patients so combinations of pathogens observed in mixed infections are different. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the outcome of mixed infection (categorized by MPCR and culture) in immunocompromised patients. To confirm our observation, further more studies are needed.",
