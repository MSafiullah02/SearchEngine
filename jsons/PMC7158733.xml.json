CpG dinucleotides are suppressed throughout the HIV-1 genomic RNA (gRNA), and introducing CpGs into gag or env inhibits viral replication (12\u201316). Furthermore, analysis of clinical HIV-1 samples found that mutations that create new CpG dinucleotides in HIV-1 are twice as costly as those that do not and that increased CpG dinucleotide abundance in env may predict disease progression (17, 18). There are at least four mechanisms by which CpG dinucleotides could inhibit HIV-1. First, CpG DNA methylation-induced transcriptional silencing could repress viral gene expression (12, 13, 19). Second, introduction of CpGs into cis-acting elements or structures required for viral replication may render them nonfunctional. Third, CpGs could create deleterious cis-acting elements or structures. Fourth, they could act as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that is recognized by the innate immune system. Supporting the hypothesis that CpGs in viral RNA could be a PAMP, the antiviral protein ZAP (zinc finger antiviral protein) has recently been shown to bind regions of HIV-1 RNA containing CpG dinucleotides and to inhibit HIV-1 with increased CpG content in env (16).",

Subsequent studies have shown that ZAP also inhibits alphaviruses, filoviruses, and hepadnaviruses, as well as some flaviviruses and picornaviruses (21\u201325). ZAP inhibits viral replication by binding viral RNA and targeting it for degradation and/or inhibiting its translation (20, 21, 26\u201328). It may also have other mechanisms of antiviral activity. However, ZAP does not restrict all viruses, and yellow fever virus, Zika virus, dengue virus, herpes simplex virus 1, vesicular stomatitis virus, and poliovirus are resistant to its antiviral activity (21, 24). ZAP does not have enzymatic activity and interacts with other cellular proteins, such as TRIM25 and KHNYN, to restrict viral replication (29\u201331). Why some viruses are sensitive to ZAP and others are resistant, and whether the CpG abundance and context in viruses determines this, remains unknown. It is also unclear whether the deleterious effect of CpG dinucleotides on viral replication is mediated exclusively by ZAP or through additional mechanisms.",

            "text": "Overall, the specific mechanisms by which CpG dinucleotides inhibit viral replication are not well understood for any virus. Because CpGs are highly suppressed in HIV-1, it is an excellent model virus to study the antiviral effects of the dinucleotide. In this study, we introduced CpGs into different contexts and regions of the viral genome and analyzed how they restricted viral gene expression and replication. First, we determined whether there was a position-dependent effect of CpGs on viral replication. Second, we analyzed whether there was a correlation between endogenous ZAP activity and the abundance of CpG dinucleotides. Third, we tested whether increasing ZAP abundance increased its antiviral effect. In sum, we found that CpGs in different contexts and locations inhibited viral gene expression through ZAP-dependent inhibition of gene expression and ZAP-independent changes in pre-mRNA splicing. Importantly, the number of introduced CpG dinucleotides did not predict the magnitude of their antiviral activity or inhibition by endogenous ZAP. ZAP appears to target a specific region in env containing introduced CpGs more efficiently than other regions in the viral genome, though high levels of ZAP can target most regions of the genome containing CpGs. Our results indicate that the context and position of CpG dinucleotides in the HIV-1 genome determine how they inhibit viral replication through ZAP-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",

            "text": "An important experimental consideration when studying how CpGs regulate HIV-1 is that CpG DNA methylation-induced transcriptional silencing could potentially inhibit HIV-1 gene expression. However, CpGs in plasmids amplified in bacteria are not methylated when the plasmid is transiently transfected into mammalian cells (38\u201340), and we have therefore used an experimental approach in which HIV-1 proviral DNA plasmids are transfected into HeLa or 293T cells. A region in env immediately after vpu does not contain any detectable cis-acting RNA elements, which makes it a good region to analyze the effect of introducing CpGs (Fig. 2; see Data Set S2). It has previously been shown that introducing 36 CpGs into env nucleotides (nt) 86 to 561 (HIV-1env86\u2013561CpG) inhibits HIV-1 genomic-RNA abundance, Gag expression, Env expression, and infectious-virus production (Fig. 3A, C, and E and Table 1) (16, 31). Importantly, this restriction is eliminated in ZAP knockout cells (Fig. 3B, C, and E), indicating that it is due to the recognition of the CpG dinucleotides by ZAP. To further characterize how CpGs affect HIV-1 replication, we inserted 48 CpGs into env nt 611 to 1014 (HIV-1env611\u20131014CpG) (Fig. 3A and Table 1) and analyzed their effect on HIV-1 genomic-RNA abundance, Env expression, Gag expression, and infectious-virus production. These CpGs inhibited HIV-1 infectious-virus production more potently than the 36 CpGs in HIV-1env86\u2013561CpG in the control CRISPR cells (Fig. 3C). However, in the ZAP knockout cells, Gag expression, Env expression, and virion production were only partially increased for HIV-1env611\u20131014CpG, and infectious-virus production was rescued only \u223c2-fold (Fig. 3C). This indicates that the 48 CpGs introduced into this region of env caused both ZAP-dependent and ZAP-independent suppression of infectious-virus production. Nef is expressed from fully spliced mRNAs that do not contain the env region with the introduced CpGs (36). As expected, the CpGs introduced into HIV-1env86\u2013561CpG did not decrease Nef expression (Fig. 3C). However, there was decreased Nef expression for HIV-1env611\u20131014CpG, and this was not rescued in the ZAP CRISPR cells. This suggests that another mechanism, such as altered splicing, contributes to the CpG-mediated decrease in infectious-virus production for HIV-1env611\u20131014CpG. Furthermore, genomic-RNA abundance for HIV-1env611\u20131014CpG was not fully restored to wild-type levels in ZAP knockout cells, indicating that the CpGs in HIV-1env611\u20131014CpG inhibit genomic-RNA abundance through ZAP-dependent and ZAP-independent mechanisms (Fig. 3E).",

To determine if inhibition by KHNYN correlated with CpG abundance or ZAP sensitivity, we overexpressed KHNYN on wild-type HIV-1, HIV-1env86\u2013561CpG, or HIV-1pol795\u20131386CpG (Fig. 4C and D). KHNYN antiviral activity was correlated with the sensitivity of the virus to endogenous ZAP, with HIV-1env86\u2013561CpG inhibited much more potently than HIV-1pol795\u20131386CpG or wild-type HIV-1.

            "text": "HIV-1 strains containing reporter genes, such as those encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase, are important experimental tools and have large numbers of CpGs in the reporter gene. Therefore, it was important to determine whether ZAP inhibits these viruses, because this could confound the interpretation of results obtained under some experimental conditions. Specifically, we analyzed whether ZAP could restrict HIV-1 containing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) followed by enhanced GFP (eGFP) (IRES-GFP) or Renilla luciferase (IRES-Renilla) (Fig. 5A and Table 1) (41, 42). Both IRES-GFP and IRES-Renilla introduced 96 CpGs into the viral genome. While both reporter viruses produced less Gag and infectious virus than wild-type HIV-1, ZAP depletion did not increase this production (Fig. 5B). We also analyzed the effect of a Venus fluorescent protein-plus-inker sequence that introduced 64 CpGs as a fusion protein with Gag (Fig. 5A and Table 1) (43). Interestingly, this sequence did not sensitize Gag abundance or virus-like particle (VLP) production to ZAP (Fig. 5C). Because a ribosome could displace ZAP bound to CpGs in an open reading frame as it moves along the mRNA, it is possible that CpGs in a 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) could inhibit HIV-1 gene expression in a ZAP-dependent manner more effectively than CpGs in a coding region. Therefore, we inserted stop codons between Gag and Venus in both the Gag and Pol reading frames (Fig. 5A and Table 1). However, the CpGs in the context of the 3\u2032 UTR also did not promote ZAP-mediated inhibition of Gag expression or VLP production (Fig. 5C). In sum, the total number of CpGs introduced into the HIV-1 genome does not correlate with their antiviral activity in the context of endogenous ZAP levels in HeLa cells.",

First, we treated control and ZAP knockout HEK293T cells with type I interferon (IFN-I) (Fig. 6). Similar to previous reports, this consistently increased expression of the short isoform of ZAP (ZAP-S) by \u223c2-fold and had no substantial effect on expression of the long isoform of ZAP (ZAP-L) (Fig. 6C) (44, 45). IFN-I inhibited all of the viruses. For wild-type HIV-1, the magnitudes of inhibition were similar in the control and ZAP knockout cells (Fig. 6A), which is consistent with the observation that endogenous ZAP does not target wild-type HIV-1 (16, 31). The magnitude of IFN-I inhibition of HIV-1env86\u2013561CpG was reduced when ZAP was depleted, indicating that ZAP contributes to the antiviral effect of IFN-I on the virus. Importantly, IFN-I treatment augmented the ZAP-dependent inhibition of HIV-1pol795\u20131386CpG. This suggests that CpG-rich sequences in an HIV open reading frame that are only weakly restricted by endogenous ZAP levels can be further sensitized by IFN-I. However, even in the presence of IFN-I, the magnitude of inhibition by the 53 introduced CpGs in pol was lower than that of the inhibition mediated by the 36 introduced CpGs in env. For HIV-1\u2013IRES-GFP and HIV-1\u2013IRES-Renilla, the magnitude of IFN-I inhibition was not decreased upon ZAP depletion (Fig. 6B). This indicates that endogenous ZAP does not target these viruses, despite the large numbers of CpGs that have been introduced into the viral genome.",

However, altering the RNA sequence could modulate the local RNA structure in ways that a large deletion did not, and the 5\u2032 region of gag has been shown to indirectly regulate gRNA packaging by regulating the structure of the 5\u2032 UTR (48, 49). To determine if the CpGs in HIV-1gag22\u2013378CpG specifically decreased infectious-virus production or if a cis-acting regulatory element in the region had been mutated, we changed the codons previously mutated to introduce CpGs into a different codon (DC) that was not the wild-type HIV-1 codon and did not introduce a CpG where possible to produce pHIV-1gag22\u2013378DC (Fig. 8A and Table 1). HIV-1gag22\u2013378DC produced levels of infectious virus similar to those of wild-type HIV-1 (Fig. 8B). We also measured gRNA abundance in the cell lysate and medium. HIV-1gag22\u2013378CpG had \u223c60% and \u223c80% decreases in gRNA in the lysate and medium, respectively, while HIV-1gag22\u2013378DC had levels of gRNA similar to those of wild-type HIV-1 (Fig. 8C and D). This indicates that the introduced CpGs are necessary for the reduction in infectious-virus production and not a result of mutating essential cis-acting elements in the region that modulate gRNA packaging or other steps of HIV-1 replication. In sum, while HIV-1gag22\u2013378CM and HIV-1gag22\u2013378CpG have the same 26 introduced CpGs, there is a much larger decrease in Gag expression and intracellular gRNA abundance for HIV-1gag22\u2013378CM, and this is due to the introduced CpGs. This suggests that the sequence surrounding the CpG dinucleotides modulates their inhibitory effect.",

Interestingly, HIV-1gag22\u2013378CM\u20135nt-CpG Gag expression and infectious-virus production were very similar to those of HIV-1gag22\u2013378CM (Fig. 8E). This indicates that the sequence immediately surrounding the CpG dinucleotides influences the degree to which they inhibit HIV-1 gene expression. We also analyzed intracellular Env abundance and found that Env expression was reduced to undetectable levels for HIV-1gag22\u2013378CM and HIV-1gag22\u2013378CM\u20135nt-CpG (Fig. 8E). Env expression was also decreased for HIV-1gag22\u2013378CpG, which likely accounts for the decreased infectious-virus production, in addition to the reduced gRNA levels present in virions (Fig. 8D). The decrease in Env expression was unexpected, because the region in the HIV-1 genome containing the introduced CpGs in these viruses is present only in the unspliced transcript encoding Gag and Gag-Pol and not in the singly spliced env mRNAs. Overall, the local sequence context of the CpGs in gag nt 22 to 378 determines the magnitude of inhibition for both Gag and Env expression.",

In contrast to HIV-1env86\u2013561CpG, ZAP depletion did not increase infectious-virus production for HIV-1gag22\u2013378CM and HIV-1gag22\u2013378CpG (Fig. 9A). This shows that the CpGs introduced into the 5\u2032 region of gag inhibit HIV-1 gene expression and infectious-virus production through a ZAP-independent mechanism. To determine if introducing a larger number of CpGs into gag could make it ZAP sensitive, we cloned pHIV-1gag22\u20131188CpG, which contains 62 CpG dinucleotides distributed across \u223c1,100 nt (Fig. 9B and Table 1). In addition, we produced pHIV-1gag22\u2013654CpG and HIV-1gag658\u20131188CpG, which contain 30 and 32 CpGs, respectively. Introducing CpGs into nt 22 to 654 of gag led to large decreases in Gag expression, Env expression, and infectious-virus production (Fig. 9C). Interestingly, Gag expression for HIV-1gag22\u20131188CpG and HIV-1gag22\u2013654CpG was increased in the ZAP knockout cells, though this did not affect Env expression or infectious-virus production. In contrast, introduction of 32 CpGs into nt 658 to 1188 of gag had no effect on Gag expression, Env expression, or infectious-virus production (Fig. 9C). Therefore, we introduced 60 CpGs into this 3\u2032 region of gag (HIV-1gag694\u20131206CpG) (Fig. 9B and Table 1) and analyzed the effect on infectious-virus production in control and ZAP CRISPR cells (Fig. 9D). The 60 CpGs in the 3\u2032 region of gag inhibited HIV-1 infectious-virus production about 2-fold, which is similar to the effect that 53 CpGs had in pol and less than the 36 CpGs in env. Overall, in some contexts, CpGs introduced into gag allow ZAP to inhibit Gag expression, but the number of CpGs is not correlated with the magnitude of the inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the CpGs introduced into the 5\u2032 region of gag inhibit infectious-virus production in a ZAP-independent manner.",

            "text": "The HIV-1 genomic RNA undergoes extensive alternative splicing to mediate expression of all of the viral genes, and synonymous mutations in gag have previously been shown to disrupt HIV-1 splicing (36, 50). Since the CpGs in the 5\u2032 region of gag reduced Env expression in all sequence contexts tested (Fig. 8E and 9C), we speculated that they could affect splicing. Therefore, we analyzed RNA abundance when progressively longer regions of codon-optimized gag sequence were added to the virus, which introduced 11, 18, or 26 CpGs (HIV-1gag22\u2013165CM, HIV-1gag22\u2013261CM, and HIV-1gag22\u2013378CM) (Fig. 10A and Table 1). We have previously analyzed these viruses and have shown that they are deficient for genomic-RNA abundance and Gag expression (15). A comparison of the total RNA and the genomic RNA indicated that the abundance of both was decreased by the synonymous mutations (Fig. 10B). To determine whether the decrease in viral RNA abundance is due to altered splicing, we used RNA-seq to sequence the transcriptome in each sample and determine which splice sites were used to produce the mRNAs for each virus (Fig. 10C and Table 2; see Data Set S3 in the supplemental material). This analysis showed that a preexisting cryptic splice donor (CD1) was activated. Importantly, this donor is outside the region into which the CpGs were introduced (Fig. 10D). The frequency of use of the cryptic splice donor increased with the length of the codon-optimized gag sequence and coincided with a decrease in the utilization of canonical splice donor 1 (SD1). Activation of the cryptic splice donor increased the length of the first exon incorporated into all of the spliced viral RNAs to include the gag sequence prior to CD1. This led to the incorporation of the Gag initiation codon in every transcript upstream of the canonical start codon for the encoded protein (Fig. 10C and D), which is predicted to result in inefficient translation of all HIV-1 proteins encoded by a singly or fully spliced mRNA, including Tat and Rev. This could account for the decrease in total RNA levels, genomic-RNA levels, and Gag and Env expression that we observed for HIV-1gag22\u2013378CM (Fig. 8 and 10) (15).",

First, they can recruit ZAP and target the viral RNA for degradation. Second, they can inhibit replication by altering pre-mRNA splicing. In addition, CpGs could silence HIV-1 transcription through DNA methylation. The multiple mechanisms by which CpGs inhibit HIV-1 infectious-virus production may explain why they are strongly suppressed in the virus, even compared to other RNA viruses, and may also explain why small changes in the number of CpGs in env are linked to disease progression (18). Introducing CpGs into env nt 86 to 561 potently inhibits genomic-RNA abundance, Env expression, Gag expression, and infectious-virus production in a ZAP-dependent manner. However, ZAP depletion does not fully rescue infectious-virus production when CpGs are introduced into several other regions of the HIV-1 genome, highlighting the ZAP-independent effects of CpGs, as well as the sensitivity of the 5\u2032 region of env for CpGs that mediate ZAP antiviral activity.",

These CpGs have a dramatic effect on genomic-RNA levels, Gag expression, and Env expression by promoting the use of a cryptic 5\u2032 splice donor at the expense of SD1. Interestingly, the magnitude of this effect is modulated by the sequence identity immediately surrounding the CpGs. It should be noted that these experiments were done in the context of transiently transfected proviral constructs in HeLa cells, but previous studies have shown that the splicing patterns for HIV-1 are similar in transfected cells and infected T cells (51, 52). The introduced CpGs do not directly enhance the strength of this splice site because they are upstream of the splice donor and do not affect the sequence itself. A previous report has identified that introducing synonymous mutations into the 5\u2032 end of gag promotes splicing at this cryptic donor, but the role of CpGs in this was not characterized (50). We found that CpGs introduced into this region have multiple effects on viral replication, including decreases in genomic-RNA stability, Gag expression, virion production, and infectivity per genome (15). All of these phenotypes are likely due to the decreased use of SD1 and the corresponding increase in splicing from the cryptic splice donor in gag. The CpGs introduced into the 5\u2032 end of gag could inhibit a preexisting exonic splicing silencer (ESS) or introduce an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE). We favor the hypothesis that the CpGs introduced an ESE, because the synonymous mutations promote splicing at the cryptic splice donor in a length-dependent manner and the sequence within 5 nucleotides surrounding the CpG modulates the magnitude of the decrease in Env and Gag expression. However, further experiments will be required in order to characterize how CpGs modulate splicing. There are approximately 1,500 RNA binding proteins in the human genome, most of which do not have a well-characterized recognition sequence, though several have been reported to bind sequences that contain CpGs (53, 54). Therefore, an unknown number of RNA binding proteins bind CpGs, and we do not yet know which protein regulates HIV-1 splicing in a CpG-dependent manner. In addition, introducing CpGs into the HIV-1 genome may affect its local or long-range RNA structures; posttranscriptional modifications, such as cytosine methylation; or other aspects of RNA biology (55\u201357).",

            "text": "Surprisingly, the magnitude of ZAP-mediated inhibition was not correlated with the number of CpGs introduced into the viral genome, and some regions of the genome can tolerate substantial numbers of CpGs. Thirty-six CpGs inserted into the 5\u2032 region of env had the greatest ZAP-dependent inhibitory phenotype. This corresponds to the observations by Takata et al., who first identified this region in a panel of viruses with large numbers of synonymous mutations in different regions of the HIV-1 genome (16, 50). The introduction of 53 CpGs into pol or 60 CpGs into the 3\u2032 end of gag produced only a small amount of ZAP-dependent inhibition of infectious-virus production. KHNYN overexpression also produced less inhibition of infectious-virus production when 53 CpGs were introduced into pol than when 36 CpGs were added to env. This supports our hypothesis that KHNYN antiviral activity is controlled by ZAP\u2019s ability to target the viral RNA (31). Only when ZAP levels were very high due to overexpression from a cDNA plasmid did the 53 CpGs in pol mediate a level of repression similar to that mediated by the 36 CpGs introduced into env nt 86 to 561. This highlights the facts that this region in env is very sensitive to the endogenous levels of ZAP in HeLa cells and that the position or local context of the CpG is important for ZAP to inhibit the virus. Interestingly, the weak inhibition of infectious-virus production by the 53 CpGs in pol mediated by endogenous ZAP levels could be substantially enhanced by IFN-I treatment. Therefore, part of the anti-HIV activity mediated by IFN-I (58) may be to promote ZAP targeting CpGs in contexts where it normally does so inefficiently. The fact that there is only a small increase in ZAP-S abundance upon IFN-I treatment raises the question of whether this induction of ZAP is sufficient to explain the phenotype or whether increased abundance or activity of ZAP cofactors, such as TRIM25 or KHNYN, may contribute (29\u201331, 59).",

Adding 96 CpGs to the 3\u2032 end of the genome in the context of IRES-GFP or IRES-Renilla luciferase did not sensitize the virus to the endogenous levels of ZAP in HeLa or HEK293T cells. Similarly, HIV-1 with GFP in place of nef has previously been shown not to be targeted by endogenous levels of ZAP in HeLa or MT4 cells (16). While HIV-1\u2013IRES-GFP and HIV-1\u2013IRES-Renilla were not inhibited by ZAP after IFN-I treatment, they were inhibited when high levels of ZAP were present due to overexpression from a cDNA plasmid. Therefore, ZAP abundance can determine whether CpG-containing viral genomes are targeted, though it is unclear whether the ZAP levels produced from plasmid-based overexpression can be achieved in a relevant in vivo context. This suggests that these reporter viruses are useful tools that may not be affected by ZAP under many experimental conditions.",

To date, the primary evidence that ZAP directly binds CpGs comes from PAR-CLIP experiments (16). The advantage of this technique is that it captures ZAP binding to CpGs in a living cell. However, other cellular factors present could modulate ZAP\u2019s binding specificity. Several groups have shown that the ZAP cofactor TRIM25 can bind cellular and viral RNA, and it has been reported to regulate ZAP binding to Sindbis virus RNA (29, 30, 60\u201365). Therefore, TRIM25 or other ZAP cofactors could bind specific motifs in viral RNA to determine the sensitivity of the RNA to ZAP-mediated antiviral activity. In addition, it is not known how many ZAP molecules are required to bind RNA to mediate antiviral activity or if they have to be clustered in a specific way. While structural and mutagenesis studies of the RNA binding domain in ZAP have shown that it is a dimer that may have two RNA binding cavities within a large RNA binding cleft, how it binds CpG dinucleotides remains unknown (66, 67). To fully understand how specific CpGs mediate ZAP-dependent antiviral activity, it will be essential to understand how ZAP binds CpGs in specific RNA contexts and structures and the role its cofactors play in modulating its RNA binding activity.",

            "text": "It will be interesting to compare how CpGs inhibit HIV-1 to how they inhibit other RNA viruses and if they do so by targeting viral RNA for degradation, by inhibiting its translation, or through other mechanisms. CpGs directly or indirectly introduced into coding and noncoding regions of picornaviruses have shown that they can potently attenuate viral replication and create strains that protect animals from challenge with the wild-type virus (6\u20138, 10, 68). ZAP has recently been shown to be necessary for introduced CpGs to inhibit the picornavirus echovirus 7 (32). CpGs have also been shown to attenuate influenza A virus and to protect animals from lethal challenge by the wild-type virus (9). However, the molecular mechanism of attenuation remains unclear, and the CpGs could inhibit via ZAP, altered RNA splicing similar to what we have observed in HIV-1, or other mechanisms. This highlights both a challenge and an opportunity for introducing CpG dinucleotides to create live attenuated vaccines. The multiple mechanisms of action, as well as the position and context dependence of CpG-mediated viral inhibition, pose a challenge to determining the engineering principles for attenuating viruses with a predicted magnitude and mechanism. The opportunity is that CpGs can be used to attenuate viruses through multiple and potentially additive or synergistic mechanisms, which may enhance the utility of this approach.",

The 16-nt noncoding sequence between tat and vpu was deleted, the frameshift heptanucleotide was changed from UUUUUUA to UUUUUUAA to fuse gag and pol, and single-nucleotide insertions (N) or deletions were applied as necessary to fuse ORFs in frame. Sequences were translated into amino acid sequences, which were aligned with CLUSTAL W (69). The amino acid alignment was then converted back to a nucleotide alignment with tranalign from the EMBOSS package (70). The alignment was then mapped to the coordinates of a specific reference sequence (viz. EU541617) by removing alignment positions that contained a gap character in the reference sequence. After calculating the synonymous site conservation statistics with synplot2, they were mapped to EU541617 genome coordinates (i.e., by reinserting noncoding regions) for display (Fig. 2). The following GenBank sequences were used in the alignment: AB023804, AF321523, EU861977, JN944905, JX236669, M38429, AB287379, AY805330, FJ670516, JN944907, JX236670, AB485648, FJ771006, JN944941, JX236671, AB485649, FJ771007, JN944942, JX236672, AF004394, FJ771008, JN944943, JX236673, U26942, AF004885, FJ771009, JN944944, JX236676, U34603, AF005494, FJ771010, JN944945, JX236677, U34604, AF005496, GQ290462, JN944946, JX236678, U39362, AF077336, GU237072, JN944947, JX236679, U63632, AF082394, DQ676872, GU362882, JN944948, K03454, U88824, AF082395, DQ979025, JN106043, JX236668, M27323, AF286237, EU541617, KC156212, KC156213, KC156214, KC156215, KC156218, and KC156221. We also used the WARO, MCST, RHGA, STCOr1, and CH457 sequences, which have previously been described (71, 72). The z-scores for 9-, 15-, and 25-codon windows were as follows: 9-codon window, z \u2265 3.603808; 15-codon window, z \u2265 3.468872; 25-codon window, z \u2265 3.329161.

Adapter trimming was performed using BBDuk (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-andtools/bbtools/), and read pairs were merged with BBmerge (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) in order to increase base call quality and generate long, whole-fragment reads. The reads were then aligned with the human genome (hg38) and the HIVNL4-3 genomic-RNA sequence simultaneously using Hisat2 (82). HIV-mapping junction-spanning reads were isolated using regtools (https://github.com/griffithlab/regtools) to allow per-junction read counting. To visualize junctions of interest, data from replicates were first merged using the Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) MergeSamFiles function, followed by generation of sashimi plots using Gviz (83). The percentage of HIV-1 junction-spanning reads was calculated by dividing the number of reads for each junction by the total number of junction-spanning reads in the library.",
