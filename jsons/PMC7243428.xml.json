Therefore, the COVID-19 crisis has dominated the political agenda of governments around the globe for the past months.

However, the level of strictness in government-responses to Corona is an ambiguous variable: On the one hand, a healthy economy is doubtlessly dependent on healthy people; hence, strict measures can safeguard the economy. On the other hand, extreme strictness can strangulate the economy and contribute to a severe economic downturn, recession, or even long-term depression. Finding the right balance is key and a demanding task that benefits from comparisons such as the one provided by this paper.",

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) calls COVID-19 worse than the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007/2008, estimating that growth in Asia is expected to stall at 0% in 2020. This makes it the worst year in the last 60 years and under-performing than both the GFC (4.7%) and the Asian financial crisis (1.3%) of 1997 (Rhee 2020). Since the initial coronavirus infections began picking up in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December 2019, China has implemented a quarantine and lockdown in Wuhan, with a level of strictness in limiting economic and social life that is unprecedented. Due to the high population density and rising number of infections and death toll, the Chinese Government rolled out quickly a comprehensive response that includes heavy restrictions on people\u2019s movements, closedowns of restaurant and shops, technology-enabled scanning, and checking tools, which managed to control the pandemic and move ahead of \u201ccurve\u201d of the virus headway.",

The manufacturing sector which is still critical for China\u2019s export-oriented growth story, has been harshly hit by the interruption in production and logistics. The low manufacturing activity is attributed to the uncertainties and sluggish demand in the domestic and international market, where orders have been canceled or postponed. Equally, the restaurant sector is under serious threat; large scale chains and small size family-run outlets have seen their businesses shut and running out of cash for paying staff members. Both sectors are a major source of employment, particularly among the country\u2019s 288 million floating population, internal migrant workers (a third of the total workforce), who became the most vulnerable group to the economic decline. Without readily available \u201csafety nets\u201d through social securities for most of the migrant workers, China\u2019s labor market pressure with an estimation of 70 million jobless workers will have profound socioeconomic effects and even unrests in China.",

One being the attempt by major economies to reduce the trade dependencies and over-reliance on China\u2019s manufacturing role in key industries, for instance, the production of personal protection equipment (PPE), by shifting such production out of China back to home countries. Another consideration for this important move is the potential escalation of the bilateral trade conflict and increasing volatile political tensions between China and the USA. As China\u2019s increasing labor costs in recent years have already been off-putting for some foreign investors, the bold move by the US and Japanese governments in offering financial incentives for reshoring manufacturing from China may have a long-term cascading structural effect on China\u2019s economy and domino effect on other countries in Europe and elsewhere.",

The emerging tendency of localizing or domesticating the global supply chain is likely to continue, especially for perceived strategic industries of national interests. While an immediate reshoring from China on a large scale is not foreseen, China cannot afford this potential decoupling process and needs to restructure its industrial composition, incentivize higher domestic consumption, and reconsider its strategy for overseas investment\u2014all this amid growing uncertainties, greater scrutiny, and a potentially hostile environment.

Restaurants, schools, and shops all remain open in the southern part of the East Asian peninsula. This is striking: after all, South Korea used to have the highest number of confirmed cases after China in early February 2020. Many other nations with as many cases have reacted with harsh and strict lockdowns, such as China, France, Italy, or Spain: The Coronavirus Government Response Tracker of the University of Oxford has confirmed the positive relationship between number of COVID-19 cases and strictness of governmental response (Oxford University 2020).",

Second, being a highly digital nation, the implementation of tech-based tracking, via credit cards, mobile phones, or CCTV cameras has been easier for the digital frontrunner South Korea, by comparison to other, even developed countries, especially those with populations that are more technology-skeptical, such as Germany.

Rather than explicitly setting the goal of scaling up testing until capacities became sufficient, the government appointed an 11-member scientific council and argued that systematic testing was not needed. The recommendations and political injunctions that followed were contradictory and created a feeling of confusion: Maintaining the first round of municipal elections (March 15) while enforcing the closure of schools (March 12) and then total lockdown (March 17). Lagadec established that disaster communication should avoid confronting the population with a double-bind situation through dissonant incentives (Lagadec 2009).
