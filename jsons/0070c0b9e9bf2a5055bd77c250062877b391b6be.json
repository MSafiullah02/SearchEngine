            "text": "With the rapid development of COVID-19 into a global pandemic, there is an ever more urgent need for cheap, fast and reliable tools that can assist physicians in diagnosing COVID-19. Medical imaging such as CT can take a key role in complementing conventional diagnostic tools from molecular biology, and, using deep learning techniques, several automatic systems were demonstrated promising performances using CT or X-ray data. Here, we advocate a more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging to guide COVID-19 detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive and ubiquitous in medical facilities around the globe. Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung ultrasound (POCUS) dataset consisting of (currently) 1103 images (654 COVID-19, 277 bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos. While this dataset was assembled from various online sources and is by no means exhaustive, it was processed specifically to feed deep learning models and is intended to serve as a starting point for an open-access initiative. Second, we train a deep convolutional neural network (POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an accuracy of 89% and, by a majority vote, a video accuracy of 92% . For detecting COVID-19 in particular, the model performs with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation. Third, we provide an open-access web service (POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https: //pocovidscreen.org.",

Due to its long incubation time, fast, accurate and reliable techniques for early disease diagnosis are key in successfully fighting the spread [1] . The standard genetic test, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is characterized by high reliability (at least in most countries) but a relatively long processing time (more than an hour). Alternatively, fast serology tests are in early stages of development, and are based on antibodies that the immune system only produces in an advanced stage of the disease. It is of great concern, however, that several publications have reported the problem of false negatives thrown by molecular genetics and immunological tests [2, 3, 4, 5] . Overall, global containment efforts suffer from bottlenecks in diagnosis due to partially unreliable tests and lacking availability of the necessary testing equipment; a situation exacerbated by often asymptomatic, yet infected patients that are not properly managed due to the lack of precision around the global process [2] .",

In this context, biomedical imaging techniques have great potential to complement the conventional diagnostic techniques of COVID-19 such as molecular biology (RT-PCR) and immune (IGM/G) assays. Specifically, imaging can be a viable tool in the detection process by providing a fast assessment of patients in order to guide the selection of subsequent molecular and immunological tests. Indeed, it was reported in two studies that CT scans can detect COVID-19 at higher sensitivity rate (98, respectively 88%) compared to RT-PCR (71% and 59%) in cohorts of 51 [6] and 1014 patients [7] . Note that sensitivity of RT-PCR varies heavily across countries, ranging from 65% [5] to 96% [8] . While CT scans are the gold standard for pneumonia detection [9] , X-ray scans are still the first line examination, despite their low specificity and sensitivity [10, 11] , whereas ultrasound (US) has only received growing attention in the last few years [12] and achieved promising results [13] . In this contribution, we emphatically make the case for a more prominent role of the latter, based on clear evidence for the diagnostic value of lung ultrasound (US), which is provided in much detail in a comparison of CT, X-ray and US in section 2.",

The diagnostic routine can be accelerated by connecting the device to a cloud service and uploading the recordings automatically. As a tool that is ubiquitously available even in sparsely equipped medical facilities and that can serve not only for diagnosis but also for monitoring disease evolution on a daily basis, POCUS is the ideal biomedical imaging tool in the current crisis.",

However, this initiative is launched without the availability of an automatic tool that can assist in COVID-19 detection and patient stratification.

In the last months, a myriad of preprints attempting to use machine learning for biomedical image analysis for COVID-19 has appeared, but to the best of our knowledge they exclusively focus on Xray or CT (for reviews see [26, 27, 28, 29] ) and neither a publication nor a preprint has used ultrasound data for automatic COVID-19 detection. Here, we aim to close this gap with a first approach of training a deep learning model to detect COVID-19 on POCUS images. It is crucial to note that medical doctors must be trained thoroughly to reliably differentiate COVID-19 from pneumonia and that the relevant patterns are hard to discern for the human eye [30] . Therefore, automatic detection is highly relevant as it has been shown to reduce the time doctors invest to make a diagnosis [31] .",

Linear and convex probes are the most standard ones in medical services, and we are focusing on the latter because more data was available. The linear probe is a higher frequency probe and gives better resolution images, but with less tissue penetration and therefore more superficial images. The convex probe is more suitable for deep organs (abdomen, fetal ultrasound, etc.) or in obese patients. Usually, linear probes are preferred for lung ultrasound, but in practice, most medical facilities are equipped with a curved probe than can be used for everything, which explains why more convex probe images and videos were found online. However, available linear probes were collected as well, such that the model can be trained on both types of images once data availability is increased. Examples of the cropped images are shown in Figure 1 .",

Note that only three frames of pneumonia were classified as healthy patients, showingat the very least -the model's ability to recognize strong irregularities in lung images. Nevertheless, it is clear that further work is necessary to improve the false negative rate of COVID-19, as 75 images are classified as healthy lungs. We believe that a main reason for that is the low number of lung POCUS recordings of healthy subjects compared to the number of COVID-19 images.

An explanation for the low balanced accuracy of COVID-Net is given by the apparent inability of the model to deal with unbalanced data, leading to rarely any healthy-classifications. We were not able to obtain any better results when training the model on our data with the implementation provided by the authors. Although the model is able to differentiate between COVID and pneumonia to some extent (specificity of 0.98 for pneumonia), our model is superior in all scores except for sensitivity of COVID-19, resulting in a much higher false positive rate though. In the future, it might be beneficial though to combine several different models with ensemble methods. Table 2 : Performance comparison. Comparison of both classification models on 5-fold cross validation for each class. Acc. abbreviates accuracy and Bal. Acc. abbreviates balanced accuracy. The proposed model outperforms COVID-Net with respect to F1-scores. In particular, COVID-Net fails to handle unbalanced classes (sensitivity for healthy patients is zero), leading to a lower specificity for COVID-19.",

If a patient is suspected of COVID-19, POCUS could be used to assess the presence of lung lesion that might not have clinical repercussions and thus help detecting people at risk of lung complications which would allow to focus in a more dedicated manner on high-risk patients. For random screening, if POCOVID-Net identifies the patient with COVID-19 lung symptoms, further tests such as RT-PCR, CT-scan and medical check-up should be conducted. As POCUS devices are easily transportable, this test could take place in a primary care center where a physician or technical specialist can go to perform several screenings and avoid contamination in hospitals. It should be noted that with one device, it is possible to perform 4 to 5 lung screenings per hour, taking into account the time needed for installation and cleaning.",

First, an evident improvement of the framework would be to perform inference directly on the videos (e.g. temporal CNNs) instead of the current frame based image analysis. While we did not perform this herein explicitly (due to the lack of sufficient data), we report a promising indication, namely that the video classification based on a frame-based majority vote improved the error rate by more than 25% (from 89% to 92% accuracy). Secondly, the benefit of pre-training the network on large image databases could be improved by training the model on (non lung) ultrasound samples instead of using ImageNet, a database of real life objects. This pre-training may help detecting ultrasound specific patterns such as B-Lines. In addition, to exploit the higher availability of CT or X-ray scans, transfer learning strategies could be adopted as in [76, 77] . Furthermore, generative models could help to complement the scarce data about COVID-19 as recently proposed in [78] .",

Importantly, all samples of our database were observed by a medical doctor and we cropped the images with a quadratic window excluding measure bars and texts visible on the sides or top of the videos. Five videos were manually processed with Adobe After Effect in order to remove measure scales and other artifacts that were overlaying the US recording.",
