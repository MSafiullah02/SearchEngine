Using wireless sensor network technology, we obtained high-resolution data of CPIs during a typical day at an American high school, permitting the reconstruction of the social network relevant for infectious disease transmission. At a 94% coverage, we collected 762,868 CPIs at a maximal distance of 3 meters among 788 individuals. The data revealed a high density network with typical small world properties and a relatively homogenous distribution of both interaction time and interaction partners among subjects.

Infections that are transmitted predominantly via the droplet route, such as influenza, common colds, whooping cough, SARS-CoV and many others are among the most frequent infectious diseases. Droplets from an infected person can reach a susceptible person in close proximity, typically a distance of less than 3 meters (5, 6), making CPIs highly relevant for disease spread. However, very little is known about the dynamic patterns of CPIs in human communities. Here, we present data collected with a wireless sensor network deployment using TelosB motes (7) to detect high-resolution proximity (up to 3 meters) between subjects in a US high school. To our knowledge, the data set represents the first high-resolution temporal contact network relevant to the spread of infectious diseases via droplet transmission in a school.",

Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages. Surveys manage to capture the interactions relevant for disease transmission, but are often limited by small sample sizes (8) and are subject to human error (9) . Socio-technological networks can provide large, long-term data sets (10, 11) but fail to capture the CPIs relevant for disease transmission. The use of mobile devices aware of their location (or of other mobile devices in proximity) represents a promising third alternative. Using mobile phones to detect spatial proximity of subjects is possible with repeated Bluetooth scans (9) but the resolution is too coarse for diseases that are transmitted through the close contact route. Our approach is free of human error, captures the vast majority (94%) of the community of interest and allows us to collect high-resolution contact network data relevant for infectious disease transmission.",

The population is generally divided into communities of schools, workplaces and households, but detailed data on mixing patterns in such communities are scarce. In particular, very little is known about the contact networks in schools (16) even though schools are known to play a crucially important role in pandemic spread, mainly owing to the intensity of CPIs at schools. In what follows, we describe and analyze the contact network observed at a US high school during a typical school day. Using an SEIR simulation model, we investigate the spread of influenza on the observed contact network and find that the results are in very good agreement with absentee data from the influenza A (H1N1) spread in the fall of 2009. Finally, we implement and test various immunization strategies to evaluate their efficacy in reducing disease spread within the school.",

In order to account for the fact that the majority of the contacts are relatively short (Figure 1a) , we recalculated all statistics of the network with a minimum requirement for contact duration cm (i.e. all edges with weight < cm are removed from the graph). The network exhibits typical \"small world\" properties (22) such as a relatively high transitivity (also known as clustering coefficient, which measures the ratio of triangles to connected triplets) and short average path length for all values of cm. Assortativity, the tendency of nodes to associate with similar nodes with respect to a given property (23) , was measured with respect to degree and role of the person (i.e. student, teacher, etc.). Interestingly, while both measures are relatively high, degree assortativity decreases while role assortativity increases with higher values of cm. Due to the very high density of the contact network, a giant component exists for all values of cm. Community structure (or modularity) is relatively high, increasingly so with higher values of cm, indicating that more intense contacts tend to occur more often in subgroups and less often between such groups (24) . We find a very homogenous degree distribution with the squared coefficient of variation of the degree distribution (CV) 2 = 0.118 for the full network, and slightly increased heterogeneity in the network with higher cutoff values cm (Figure 2j ). The distributions of number of interactions c and the strength s, the weighted equivalent of the degree (25) are equally homogenous ( Figure 3 ).

Each individual is chosen as an index case for 1000 simulation runs, resulting in a total of 788,000 epidemic simulation runs. This simulation setting represents a base scenario where a single infectious case introduces the disease into the school population. In reality, multiple introductions are to be expected if a disease spreads through a population, but the base scenario used here allows us to quantify the predictive power of graph-based properties of individuals on epidemic outcomes. We assume that symptomatic individuals remove themselves from the school population after a few hours. We find that in 67.7% of all simulations, no secondary infections occur and thus there is no outbreak, whereas in the remaining 32.3% of the simulations, outbreaks occur with an average attack rate of 3.87% (all simulations: 1.33%; maximum 46.19%), and the average R0, measured as the number of secondary infections caused by the index case, because at the high temporal resolution of the data set, the degree contains many short duration contacts whose impact on epidemic spread is minimal. To estimate the sampling rate at which degree has maximal predictive power, we systematically subsampled our original data set to yield lower resolution data sets. Figure 4b shows that sampling as infrequently as every 100 minutes would have resulted in the same predictive power for degree as sampling every 20 seconds, while the maximum predictive power for degree would have been attained at ~ 20 minutes. At this sampling rate, the 95% confidence intervals for the correlation between degree and outbreak size and the correlation between strength and outbreak size start to overlap (due to the high correlation between degree and strength, blue line in Figure 4a ).",

In addition, we tested vaccination strategies that do not require contact network data (random vaccination, preferential vaccination for teachers and preferential vaccination for students, see Methods). In order to ensure robustness of the results to variation in transmission probabilities, all simulations were tested with three different transmission probabilities (see Methods). Figure 4c shows which strategies led to significantly (p < 0.05, two-sided Wilcoxon test) different outcomes at all transmission probability values. As expected, all strategies managed to significantly reduce the final size of the epidemic. Compared to the random strategy, graph-based strategies had an effect only at higher vaccination coverage.

Great care needs to be taken in interpreting these results, for various reasons. First, the limitations of the data as discussed above mean that these results may not hold in other settings, underlining the need for further empirical network studies. Second, the simulations assume neither multiple introductions nor ongoing interactions of participants outside of the school. To what extent these assumptions, particularly the latter, are violated when a disease spreads through a community is unknown and remains to be measured. Third, and perhaps most importantly, a particular immunization strategy may be optimal for reducing the number of cases in one particular school, but may at the same time not be optimal from the perspective of an entire community. Immunization strategies must also take into account medical, social and ethical aspects (30) . Thus, while we believe that data of the kind reported here can help inform public health decisions, in particular as more data become available in the future, it is clear that at this stage one cannot derive public health recommendations directly from this study. We note, however, that our findings support the notion that graph-based immunization strategies could in principle help mitigate disease outbreaks (11, 27) .",

In particular, the probability of transmission per time step (12 hours) from an infectious individual to a susceptible individual is 1 -(1-0.003) w where w is the weight of the contact edge (in CPR). Upon infection, an individual will move into the exposed class (infected but not infectious). After the incubation period, an exposed individual will become symptomatic and move into the infectious class. The incubation period distribution is modeled by a right-shifted Weibull distribution with a fixed offset of half a day (power parameter 2.21 and scale parameter 1.10, see (12) ). On the half day that the individual becomes infectious, the duration of all contacts of the infectious individual is reduced by 75%. This reduction ensures that if an individual becomes symptomatic and starts to feel ill during a school day, social contacts are reduced and the individual leaves the school or is dismissed from school after a few hours. In the following days, all contacts are reduced by 100% until recovery (i.e. the individual stays at home).",

Similar patterns were observed for SARS-CoV, another virus with the potential for rapid pandemic spread: asymptomatic cases were infrequent, and lack of transmission from asymptomatic cases was observed in several countries with SARS outbreaks (36) .",

Packets originating from this mote were transmitted at high power (-11 dBm) and were not subject to RSSI filtering at the receiver. More than 90% of mobile motes had received one or more beacons from the master stationary mote. For these mobile motes, we calculated the offset between the master and the local sequence numbers. In addition, we created a table of offsets to serve as a lookup table which included mobile motes as well as other stationary motes. To process data traces from mobile motes that did not hear directly from the master stationary mote, we used the offsets table to transitively compute a timestamp from another mote that already had its global time.",

Notably, the month of the experiment (January) is associated with the second highest percentage of influenza cases in the US for the 1976-77 through 2008-09 influenza seasons (second only to February). The data suggest that the network relevant for disease transmission is best described as a small world network with very homogenous contact structure, in which short, repeated interactions dominate. The low values of the coefficients of variation in degree, strength and number of interactions (Figure 3) suggest that the assumption of homogeneity in traditional disease models (21) might be sufficiently realistic for simulating the spread of influenza-like diseases in communities such as high schools.Furthermore, we do not find any \"fat tails\" in the contact distribution of our data set, corroborating the notion (8) that the current focus on networks with such distributions is not warranted for infectious disease spread within local communities.It is important to recognize the limitations of the data presented here, particularly in light of the fact that transmission of influenza-like diseases also occurs via other routes, for example via contact with contaminated surfaces(29). Moreover, different pathogens as well as different strains of a particular pathogen might have different minimum requirements (both spatial and temporal) that need to be met for person-toperson transmission. At present, the data capture the contact network during a single day only. However, this is not an inherent short-coming of the approach presented here, and while there is no obvious reason to assume that the large scale structure of the contact network in a high school would change substantially from day to day, long-term studies could address this issue in the future. Data collection at different schools with different demographic compositions would be helpful in clarifying if and how demographic compositions affect the properties of the network relevant for disease transmission. Wireless sensor network technology certainly allows further elucidation of the contact networks not only at different schools, but also in households, hospitals, workplaces and other community settings.",
