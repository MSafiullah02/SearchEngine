Reads were filtered and assembled into 227,924 contigs (contiguous sequences) over 750nt in size, quality filtered for GC content and complexity, which were then classified based upon BLAST hit. Blastn assignment to best hit revealed that ~ 125,000 of the contigs were small (1-2 kb) bacterial contigs with low coverage and an additional ~ 90,000 contigs were also likely to be bacterial (best hit with lower threshold for query coverage). 10,435 contigs were eukaryotic viruses with high coverage; of which 8,631 contigs were assigned to the Papillomaviridae family. Putative Papillomaviridae sequences were filtered to select full-length genomes, compared with the Papillomavirus Episteme (PaVe) database to classify known genomes (>90% similarity) and clustered at 95% identity using SPICi and Mash 3,4 resulting in 250 non-redundant HPV genomes.
