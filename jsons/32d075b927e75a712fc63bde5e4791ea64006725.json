Rhinitis can be classified as being allergic, infectious, or nonallergic/noninfectious [1] [2] [3] . The exact figures are unknown, but most ENT clinics report a 50-50 division between allergic and nonallergic patients in perennial disease. Rhinitis means inflammation of the nasal mucus membrane. However, markers of inflammation are not examined in daily clinical work. Therefore, the term \"rhinitis\" is used to indicate a disease of the nasal mucosa, which results in the symptoms of nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal blockage [3] . The mucosa of the nose and sinus are contiguous, and thus rhinitis often results in, or includes, (rhino)sinusitis.",

The etiology of some subgroups of nonallergic noninfectious rhinitis, like nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia (NARES) and drug-induced rhinitis, are quite well defined, but in the majority of the patients, the etiology and pathophysiology are unknown. These patients are classified as idiopathic rhinitis patients. A careful determination of the intensity of the symptoms combined with modern diagnostic tools enables us to discriminate idiopathic rhinitis patients from normal controls. This review discusses the possible pathophysicologic mechanisms of nonallergic noninfectious rhinitis, with emphasis on idiopathic rhinitis. [8] . Also, psychotropic agents like thioridazine, chlordiaepoxide, amitriptyline, perphenazine, and alprazolam have been shown to cause nasal symptoms as well [8] .",

Trigger factors associated by the patients with the acute onset of nasal symptoms were none or unknown in 42%, weather changes in 31%, odors in 15% and noxious or irritating substances in 12%. The same sort of patient group, with perennial symptoms of nasal hyper-reactivity involving sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction and pruritus, and frequent hyposmia was later described by others [11, 12] . Moneret-Vautrin [11] suggested that NARES is a precursor of aspirin sensitivity. Other groups were not able to find eosinophilia in their population of nonallergic rhinitis patients [13, 14] .

In addition, patients with allergic rhinitis usually complain of hyper-reactivity to nonallergic stimuli, obviously as a direct result of allergic inflammation. Until now, the most common diagnostic test for measuring nasal hyper-reactivity was intranasal histamine provocation [17] . Histamine provocations have been proven in allergic rhinitis and asthma to be a good test for hyper-reactivity. Histamine provocation, however, fails to differentiate between patients with NANIPER and control subjects [18,19\u2022] .

Sneezing did not occur. The reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity of this provocation render us with a useful diagnostic tool in idiopathic rhinitis patients.",

Using the limited data available at the moment, we might hypothesize which pathophysiologic mechanisms play a role in idiopathic rhinitis. Whether the roles of these mechanisms are major or minor and which important for many or few patients with idiopathic rhinitis, has to be further elucidated.",

Contrary to findings in the nasal mucosa [22] , damaged epithelium has been found even in mild asthmatic subjects [23] . Mechanisms that might cause this damage, like release of eosinophilic products such as MBP or loss of endopeptidases, are not different from the upper airways and thus not very likely to explain this difference. It is unclear from available data whether the bronchial epithelium is more susceptible to damage, or if most of this damage is iatrogenically induced by the way the bronchial mucosa is obtained. Moreover, studies in the nose [24] have shown that nasal mucosal absorption was decreased instead of increased during allergic rhinitis, and unchanged during the common cold. In fact, it has been suggested that plasma exudation tightens the nasal mucosa [24] . In conclusion, there are not many data pointing to increased epithelia permeability as a cause of nonallergic rhinitis.",

            "text": "What arguments do we have that inflammation plays a role in idiopathic rhinitis? First, we have to exclude all patients with NARES as defined above. This sounds easy but in many studies the difference between NARES and idiopathic rhinitis is not made. We suggest that all patients with eosinophilia in smear or nasal biopsy are taken together in the NARES group. The origin of the eosinophilia is interesting. Biopsy studies comparing different cell populations in nonallergic rhinitis are limited. The only two found in the literature are from Powe [25] and from Blom [26] . Powe describes eosinophilia in his patients comparable to perennial allergic rhinitis [25] . In accordance with this eosinophilia, he found increased numbers of IgE-positive cells. He suggests that NARES is a local IgE-mediated response that does not result in systemic Th2 responses. Although local IgE production was made plausible in the 80s by Platts-Mills and others, the final proof came recently [27] . It has been proven by at least two groups now that local IgE production takes place in the nasal mucosa of allergic patients [28, 29] . However, it remains to be proven that the same mechanism also occurs in nonallergic rhinitis patients, and whether this situation is stable over time, or if these patients, as has been shown in small children, develop allergic rhinitis in due time. It is interesting to compare these data on eosinophilia in nonallergic rhinitis with data on smoking. Passivesmoking, nonallergic children share with smoking adults a similar cellular infiltration with the Th2 profile, including eosinophils, increased IgE+ cells, and increased Il-4 [30, 31] . Because smoking results in many patients in the same clinical picture of rhinitis with rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, it might be that the NARES type of nonallergic rhinitis is caused by (passive) smoking or other proinflammatory stimuli inducing an \"allergy-like\" inflammatory response [30, 31] .",

The most important parts of the sensory nerves are the C-fibers, which are able to react to pain and temperature. The C fibers are unspecialized sensory nerve endings, which reach up between the epithelial cells to the region of the tight junctions. These C-fibers can be stimulated by inflammatory mediators, like histamine, and bradykinin, but also by a number of inhaled irritants like nicotine, cigarette smoke, formaldehyde, and capsaicin [24, 42, 43] . Depolarization of nerve endings results in release of neuropeptides form neurosecretory swellings (variosities) that are found near glands and vessels. This results in acute stimulation of cells, like endothelial, glandular, and epithelial cells within the nasal mucosa. Substances like substance P and CGRP are able to increase vascular permeability and activate submucosal glands. Some authors describe these events as neurogenic inflammation [43] . Sensory nerve stimulation also leads to impulses in the brainstem and brain, resulting in appreciation of sensations of itch, burning, cough, and stimulation of parasympathetic reflexes. The parasympathetic neural reflexes induce release of acetylcholine, VIP and other peptides that act on their specific receptors.",

However, the mechanism explaining this phenomenon is unclear. Primarily, a depletion of neuropeptides has been suggested. However, the effect of capsaicin treatment lasts for at least 1 year in most patients, making a depletion of neuropeptides an unlikely explanation. Also, no significant differences were found between placebo-and capsaicin-treated groups for leukotriene (LT) C4/D4/E4, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and tryptase, and a number of inflammatory cells, reducing the probability of an effect due to reduction of inflammatory mediators [16, 32] . The suggestion that idiopathic rhinitis represents a central type of abnormality with increased nasal perceptual acuity which is treated by reducing sensations in the nose, is not implausible [15] . However, increasing evidence showing that objective abnormalities in nasal blockage and rhinorrhea can be found in these patients reduces the chances of this hypothesis [19\u2022,48,49] . The most likely explanation until now is the ablation of C-fibers, although this has not been proven in human models [32] .",

Plasma exudation is not produced by neurogenic stimulation like capsaicin or nicotine and also not produced by methacholine provocation [59] . Moreover, unilateral provocation with bradykinin does not lead to an increase in vascular permeability on the contralateral side [60] . Contrary to the aforementioned study, vascular hyper-reactivity was found to be increased in idiopathic rhinitis [15\u2022\u2022] .",

These patients are classified as idiopathic rhinitis patients. The limited data available at the moment point to a) inflammatory disorders in a small number of patients; b) an important role for C-fibers in the pathophysiology, although direct observations explaining this mechanism are lacking; c) some indications for parasympathetic hyper-reactivity and/or sympathetic hyporeactivity; and d) indications that glandular hyper-reactivity might play a role in these patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether these mechanisms are separate causes of idiopathic rhinitis, or can be found in combination in the same patient.",
