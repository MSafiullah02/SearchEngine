The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (2) resulted in more than 1,000 clinical cases with a mortality rate of 35%, making it the second marked threatening CoV of the 21st century (8, 9).

            "text": "In February 2017, outbreaks of severe diarrhea of suckling piglets occurred in swine herds in Guangdong Province, China (11). Clinical signs consisted of acute vomiting and watery diarrhea, but porcine viruses commonly associated with diarrhea, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), were not detected in any of the clinical samples (11). The new enteric pathogen of commercial pigs that was isolated was finally identified as a new porcine CoV belonging to the species Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 (11\u201313). Our research group tentatively designated this newly emerged virus as swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV) (11), and it was later named swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV) by Zhou et al. (14). It is also known by other names, such as porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) (13). For purposes of unity, SADS-CoV is the name used to refer to this new virus in the current study. The expanded host range of bat-origin HKU2 to pigs indicates that bats play an important role in the ecology and evolution of SADS-CoV, although the mechanism of bat-to-swine transmission remains unclear. In view of the damage caused by SARS and MERS for both animal and public health, careful attention must be paid to the prevalence of CoV-associated disease among humans and domestic animals (15).",

It is critically important to assess potential species barriers of SADS-CoV transmission since the animal hosts (other than pigs and bats) and zoonotic potential are still unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that SADS-CoV possesses a very broad species tropism in vitro and is able to infect cell lines from diverse species, including rodents and humans. Furthermore, in vivo evidence from experimental infection of mice with SADS-CoV identified splenic dendritic cells (DCs) as the major site of SADS-CoV replication in mice. Finally, we demonstrated that SADS-CoV does not utilize known CoV protein receptors for cellular entry. These results present the possibility that rodents are among the susceptible hosts of SADS-CoV, highlighting the potential cross-species transmissibility of SADS-CoV.",

A total of 24 cell lines originating in various tissues of humans and different animal species were tested for susceptibility to SADS-CoV treated with or without trypsin (Table 1). As a brief summary of the results, 21 of the 24 cell lines showed significant susceptibility to SADS-CoV infection, defined by efficient viral replication, antigen expression, and the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE).

A very limited viral replication was observed in each region of the small intestine, with the ileum via i.p. infection showing continuous and decent detectable viral RNA (Fig. 3B). In the large intestine, i.p. infection also resulted in viral RNA loads slightly above the limit of detection at each time point in the ceca, whereas it led to higher viral RNA levels at 1 to 3 dpi, and much lower viral RNA at 21 to 28 dpi in the colon than that of the p.o. route (Fig. 3C). However, this replication in the large intestine did not translate into higher shedding, as hardly any viral genomes were detected, even at 1 dpi in the fecal samples collected from i.p.-infected mice (Fig. 3F).

Thus, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on sections of small and large intestine and spleen from mice infected i.p. with 5 \u00d7 105 TCID50 of SADS-CoV at 3 dpi. A monoclonal antibody against double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was used to identify cells that supported active virus replication, as dsRNA is an intermediate that only exists during intracellular viral replication. SADS-CoV dsRNA signals were observed in the splenic white pulp in the marginal zone on the edge of lymphatic follicles and in the margins of the periarteriolar lymphocyte sheath (Fig. 4A). Staining of tissue sections from mock-infected mice were used as a control (Fig. 4B). In addition to dsRNA, we also used rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) to detect the expression of the viral structural protein (M) or nonstructural protein (Nsp3-AC). At 3 dpi, anti-M or anti-AC staining was observed in the white pulp around the lymphatic nodules (Fig. 4C), similar to the localization of dsRNA staining (Fig. 4A). Tissue sections from SADS-CoV or mock-infected mice probed with preimmune sera were negative, indicating the specificity of the SADS-CoV antibody. Unfortunately, neither viral proteins (structural or nonstructural) nor dsRNA were detected in the intestine of infected mice, consistent with the detection of only very low levels of viral RNA in these tissues by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3).",

The flow cytometry method was first validated in Vero cells infected with SADS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, followed by staining with a pAb against the N or AC protein at 24 hpi (Fig. 4D). As the anti-AC pAb exhibited optimal intracellular staining for viral signals (Fig. 4D), it was used to determine the percentage of infected splenocytes. There were approximately 1.5- and 2.5-fold increases of total splenocytes positive for virus replication after p.o. and i.p. inoculation, respectively (Fig. 4E, left; Fig. 4F), with a significant increase in the total number of AC-positive splenocytes in i.p.-infected mice compared with that of p.o.

            "text": "To our knowledge, these results reveal the most extensive cell tropism among known CoVs, suggesting the functional receptor(s) for SADS-CoV is likely to be a very common molecule. In order to test this hypothesis, it was first necessary to find a cell line that was refractory to infection only at the internalization step. MDCK cells, which showed undetectable virus production in early infection tests (Fig. 1 and 2), were chosen as a potential candidate. There are four known types of functional CoV protein receptors, including angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV (18), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for MERS-CoV (19), aminopeptidase N (APN) for TGEV (20) and PDCoV (21, 22), and mouse carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (23). To test whether one of these molecules serves as the SADS-CoV receptor, we attempted to inoculate nonsusceptible MDCK cells overexpressing porcine APN, human DPP4, mouse CEACAM1a, or human ACE2 with SADS-CoV, but none of them allowed infection, as staining with anti-SADS-CoV-N pAb was negative (Fig. 6A). Meanwhile, the expression of each receptor in MDCK cells was confirmed by IFA (Fig. 6A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 6B) using antibodies against the tags fused to the receptors. We confirmed that, as positive controls, lentiviruses pseudotyped with TGEV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or MHV spike (i.e., pseudoviruses) efficiently entered MDCK cells exogenously expressing the respective receptors (Fig. 6C).\n",

Moreover, passaging of supernatants from pSEA-transfected MDCK cells onto fresh Vero cells resulted in progeny SADS-CoV infection, as evidenced by expression of the N protein (Fig. 6E), indicating that MDCK cells can also support infectious SADS-CoV production without cell-to-cell spread. Therefore, SADS-CoV apparently does not utilize any of the known CoV receptors for cellular entry. The same conclusion was reached using HeLa cells overexpressing each of the four classical CoV receptors followed by SADS-CoV inoculation by Zhou et al. (14); however, the HeLa cell line itself was most susceptible to SADS-CoV infection in the present study (Fig. 2D).",

In fact, experimental infection of neonatal piglets with a higher dose of purified SADS-CoV in our laboratory resulted only in mild diarrheal signs or subclinical infection (11). Also, there was a lack of robust viral replication in the intestines during infection, and no tissue damage was detected throughout the intestines (Fig. 3B and C), reflecting the suboptimal infection by SADS-CoV in immunocompetent wild-type mice. On the contrary, the virus had more efficient replication within the spleen, which was reflected by a continuous detection of viral genomic RNA in the immune cells at all time points over a 28-day period (Fig. 3D). The phenotype was also consistent with the replication kinetics in extracted splenocytes in vitro, in which viral genomic RNA peaked and plateaued at 72 hpi (Fig. 4G and I). These data collectively led to speculation that SADS-CoV favors splenic cells over other tissues. The most logical explanation for these tissue-specific discrepancies in virus replication is (i) target cells are more concentrated in the spleen and more sporadic in the intestine or (ii) splenic immune cells have enhanced expression of the unknown receptor(s) over intestinal cells. The animals were more susceptible to i.p. infection, resulting in higher virus replication in the distal section of the small intestine, large intestine, and spleen, and perhaps a delayed clearance of viral infection in the cecum (Fig. 3B to E), suggesting the important role of mucosal immunity for controlling early infection in SADS-CoV in mice. It should be noted that mice (C57BL/6J mice in this study) may not be the optimal rodent species for SADS-CoV infection, as wild rats are more commonly seen in Chinese pig farms. In addition, other transmission routes may be considered. Recently, PDCoV has been shown to possibly spread via the respiratory route in addition to fecal-oral transmission (28). Therefore, it will be interesting to try intranasal route for the inoculation in rats or the other rodent species to mimic SADS-CoV natural transmission in future studies.",

There have been a few reports of immune cell tropism for CoVs. Macrophages are susceptible to MHV infection, representing the largest group of innate immune cells that infiltrate the central nervous system after infection with neurotropic MHV strains (29). In addition, based on the fact that SARS-CoV spike-pseudotyped HIV-based vectors can efficiently transduce human DCs, Kobinger et al. hypothesized that SARS-CoV infection in immature DCs contributes to viral pathogenesis (30). Yang et al. demonstrated that SARS-CoV can infect myeloid DCs via S glycoprotein-associated cell entry and DC infection-mediated viral transmission to other cells in vivo (31). These previous evidences support our present results, showing that SADS-CoV can efficiently replicate in DCs.",

            "text": "Furthermore, this study gives us a novel inspiration that rodents may potentially serve as susceptible hosts for SADS-CoV in addition to bats and pigs. Of note, the species Rhinolophus bat \u03b1-CoV HKU2, including SADS-CoV, possesses unique S genes closely related to the betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV), in a manner similar to some globally distributed rodent \u03b1-CoVs (11, 32, 33), implying an unknown evolutionary connection between the bat \u03b1-CoV HKU2 and rodent \u03b1-CoVs. Under the field conditions of China, direct contact between pigs and flying bats is a low probability; however, rodents (especially rats) are frequently visible in the swine industry, causing great nuisance due to feed loss. It is possible that as bats prey on insects near pig facilities, they leave feces containing HKU2-like CoVs that contaminate pig feed, which is then eaten by pig and rodents that subsequently become carriers of SADS-CoV. Rats and mice are increasingly implicated as external vectors for a wide range of different pig pathogens, such as Lawsonia intracellularis (34). Rodents not only spread pathogens but also harm the practitioners of the swine industry, as they are thought to be the major source of leptospirosis in pigs and piggery workers (35). Future studies on identifying SADS-CoV-positive samples in rodents near pig farms are warranted to test this hypothesis.",

Briefly, each of the plasmids encoding TGEV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) S proteins were cotransfected into 293T cells with pLenti-Luc-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and psPAX2 plasmids (kindly provided by Zhaohui Qian, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College) at a molar ratio of 1:1:1 by using polyethylenimine (PEI). The cells were fed with fresh medium in the next 24 h, and the supernatant media containing pseudovirions were then collected and centrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g for 5 min to remove debris. To quantify S protein-mediated entry of pseudovirions, MDCK cells were seeded at about 25% to 30% confluence in 24-well plates and transfected with either pAPN-Flag, hDPP4-Flag, mCEACAM1a-Flag, hACE2-GFP (kindly provided by Zhaohui Qian) (38), or the control backbone vector by using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher). The MDCK cells overexpressing each receptor were inoculated with 500 \u03bcl of 1:1 diluted corresponding pseudovirions at 24 h posttransfection. At 40 hpi, cells were lysed at room temperature with 110 \u03bcl of medium with an equal volume of Steady-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI). The cell lysates were also used to confirm the expression of each receptor by using Western blotting. Transduction efficiency was monitored by quantitation of luciferase activity using a Modulus II microplate reader (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). On the other hand, the MDCK cells overexpressing each receptor were inoculated with SADS-CoV (MOI, 1) at 24 h posttransfection. IFA was performed to test for SADS-CoV susceptibility using anti-N pAb. The replication competency of SADS-CoV in MDCK cells was further determined by a reverse genetics system. Development of a DNA-launched SADS-CoV (SeACoV) infectious cDNA clone (named pSEA) and rescue of SADS-CoV by transfection of cultured cells with pSEA followed by passaging on Vero cells have been described recently by our lab (24).",
