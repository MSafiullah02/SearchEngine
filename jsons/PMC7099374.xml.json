Studies suggest that the virus has been circulating in bats for a number of years.4, 5 Strains of MERS-CoV have been isolated from dromedary (single-humped) camels in Egypt, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Genetic sequencing shows close links between the human and camel viruses and supports the premise that camels are a likely source of infection in humans. The recent surge in cases corresponds with similar but smaller spikes in April and May in 2012 and 2013 and may be related to the camel breeding season. However, many cases report no contact at all with camels, suggesting that there may be another environmental source.",

As SARS began to spread globally, this reluctance was replaced by unprecedented cooperation among international health authorities that led to containment of the outbreak in 4 months. One of the positive outcomes of the SARS outbreak was the adoption of the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR).34 Worldwide, 197 countries have adopted the IHR, which provides a new framework for the coordination of the management of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. The WHO hopes that when fully implemented, the IHR will improve the capacity of all countries to detect, assess, notify, and respond to public health threats. Thus, the MERS-CoV outbreak is a test of global public health preparedness and cooperation.",
