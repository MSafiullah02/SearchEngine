Using a serological signature of IgG to four antigens, it was possible to identify infected individuals with 96.1% sensitivity (95% CI; 93.0%, 97.9%) and 99.1% specificity (95% CI; 97.4%, 99.7%). Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 increase rapidly 1-2 weeks after symptom onset, with antibody responses predicted to peak within 2-4 weeks. Informed by prior data from other coronaviruses, one year following symptom onset antibody responses are predicted to decay by approximately 60% from the peak response. Depending on the selection of sero-positivity cutoff, we estimate that the sensitivity of serological diagnostics may reduce to 56% -97% after six months, and to 49% -93% after one year.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Since then, it has spread rapidly, with confirmed cases being recorded in nearly every country in the world. The presence of viral infection can be directly detected via reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) on samples from nasopharyngeal or throat swabs. For individuals who display symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 virus is detectable in the first 2-3 weeks following symptom onset [1, 2] . Viral shedding is however shorter in mild cases with only upper respiratory tract symptoms (1-2 weeks) [3] . For asymptomatic individuals, the duration for which SARS-CoV-2 virus can be detected is uncertain. In most countries neither mild cases nor asymptomatic cases will be tested by RT-qPCR (unless they are direct contacts of known cases), and even among tested individuals many may be viremia negative at time of testing due to low viral load or improper sampling. While not suitable for diagnosis of clinical cases, serology is a promising tool for identifying individuals with previous infection by detecting antibodies generated in response to SARS-CoV-2. However, the utility of serological testing depends on the kinetics of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response during and after infection.",

Instead, a range of assays can provide measurements that are positively associated with the true antibody concentration, e.g. an optical density from an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or a median fluorescent intensity (MFI) from a Luminex assay. In contrast to the continuous measurement of antibody response provided by laboratory-based research assays, most point-of-care serological tests provide a binary outcome: sero-negative or sero-positive. There are several commercially available tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, which are being catalogued by FIND Diagnostics [5] . These tests are typically based on lateral flow assays mounted in plastic cartridges which detect antibodies in small volume blood samples. A key feature of many rapid tests is that they are dependent on the choice of sero-positivity cutoff, and there may be substantial misclassification for antibody levels close to this cutoff.",

For samples taken in the first few weeks after symptom onset, the serological signature will be noisy as many individuals may still be in the phase where antibody levels are still rising ( Figure 5A ). Once the rising phase of antibody responses has completed in all individuals, we predict a clear serological signature as shown in Figure 5B . Once antibody levels have peaked, we predict that waning antibody levels over time will cause the cluster of positive responses to move closer to the cluster of negative antibody responses ( Figure 5C,D) .

As we wait for this data to be collected, mathematical models can provide important insights into how SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels may change over time. Modelling beyond the timeframe for which we have data has its limitations, however our approach benefits from robust quantification of uncertainty accounting for a wide range of future scenarios.

For sero-surveillance of pathogens with low prevalence (<20%), we recommend prioritizing specificity. For example, if the true sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a population is 8%; a test with 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity would return an estimate of 1x8% + 0.1x92% = 17.2%, a substantial over-estimate. Due to the potential problem of false positives, we recommend aiming for a high specificity target of >99%. However, accurate validation of high sensitivity and high specificity serological diagnostic tests requires large number of samples. Many tests are validated on fewer than 100 samples [5] , and this is not sufficient. Indeed, the 594 samples used in this analysis is also arguably not sufficient. Ideally, we would aim to validate on ~1,000 positive and ~1,000 negative samples. Furthermore, it is important to avoid testing on homogenous panels of samples. Obtaining samples from multiple panels with different epidemiological backgrounds will contribute to more robust validation.",

Measured antibody responses are shown as red points. Posterior median model predictions are shown as black lines, with 95% credible intervals in grey. The horizontal dashed line represents the cutoff for sero-positivity. Note that as there is no data on the long-term antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, three different sources of prior information were utilized. The half-life of the long-lived component of the antibody responses was assumed to be 50 days (short prior), 100 days (medium prior), or 200 days (long prior). Note that each of the three assumptions give near identical fits for the short-term kinetics displayed here.",

Model predictions of the decay of antibody responses are strongly determined by prior information on longitudinal follow-up of individuals infected with other coronaviruses [25-30]. Under the scenario that the decay of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses is similar to that of SARS-CoV, we would expect substantial reductions in antibody levels within the first year after infection. For the sero-positivity cutoffs highlighted here, this could cause approximately 50% of individuals to test sero-negative after one year, depending on the exact choice of biomarker and sero-positivity cut-off.This presents a potential problem for SARS-CoV-2 serological diagnostics. Most commercially available diagnostic tests compare antibody responses to a fixed sero-positivity cutoff. Where these cutoffs have been validated, it is typically by comparison of serum from negative control samples collected pre-epidemic with serum from hospitalized patients in the first weeks of infection (i.e. when antibody responses are likely to be at their highest)[32,33]. If we fail to account for antibody kinetics, we risk incorrectly classifying individuals with old infections (e.g. >6 months) as sero-negative. This is particularly important for commercially available point-of-care rapid serological tests with fixed cutoffs, limited dynamic",
