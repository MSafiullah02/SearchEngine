As the growth rates \u03bb(t) of tested positive COVID-19 cases have crossed the threshold in many countries, with negative numbers as surrogate for disease transmission deceleration, lockdowns lifting are linked to the behavior of the momentary reproduction numbers r(t), often called R 0 . Important to note that this concept alone can be easily misinterpreted as it is bound to many internal assumptions of the underlying model and significantly affected by the assumed recovery period. Here we present our experience, as part of the Basque Country Modeling Task Force (BMTF), in monitoring the development of the COVID-19 epidemic, by considering not only the behaviour of r(t) estimated for the new tested positive cases -significantly affected by the increased testing capacities, but also the the momentary growth rates for hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deceased and recovered cases, in assisting the Basque Health Managers and the Basque Government during the lockdown lifting measures. Two different data sets, collected and then refined during the As the COVID-19 pandemic is unfolding, research on mathematical modeling became imperative and very influential, not only in understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 but also in helping the national health systems to cope with the high demands of hospitalizations, for example, providing projections and predictions based on the available data. Used as a public health guiding tools to evaluate the impact of intervention measures, governments have already taken important decisions based on modeling results [1, 2, 3].",

The model is calibrated using the empirical data provided by the Basque Health Department and the Basque Health Service (Osakidetza), continually collected with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The observed signal from \"Data set A\" would significantly impact decisions on lockdown lifting, as the national plan for lifting the restrictions imposed during the state of alarm, called \"Plan for the Transition towards a new normality\", was announced on April 28, 2020 [18] . Taking place over 4 phases, with a gradual de-escalation to \"a new normality\", the plan is dependent on the on-going progress of COVID-19 epidemic's control across the different regions of Spain. However, results obtained by \"Data set B\" would, alternatively, support the already started lockdown lifting with its \"Phase Zero\" initiated on May 4, 2020.

Figure 4 shows the behavior of three variables that are synchronized in the Basque Country, I cum , C H , and C U . They also cross the threshold to a negative growth rate on April 1st, 2020, confirming the observed r(t) trend obtained by looking at data on I cum alone. Recovered and deceased cases, shown in Fig. 4 b) , follow 1-2 weeks later, due to the delay between onset of symptoms, hospitalization and eventually death, reaching negative growth rate on April 7 and April 11, 2020, respectively. Besides the observed deviation of I, for the \"Data set A\", the other variables are kept below the threshold, constantly negative until May 9, 2020, supporting the political decision of starting lifting the lockdown measures rather sooner than later in time. So which measure should be considered to guide political decisions? Here, the answer is simple.
