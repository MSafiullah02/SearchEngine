Many metagenomic data sets are now available, with deep sequencing of samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic data set can be readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such data sets are less accessible. In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-metagenomic approach, examining close matches to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in all high-throughput sequencing data sets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the \"virome\" keyword. In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence (F. Wu, S. Zhao, B. Yu, Y. M. Chen, et al., Nature 579:265-269, 2020, https://doi., et al., Nature 579:270 -273, 2020, https://doi.org/ 10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7), we note a strong homology to numerous sequence reads in metavirome data sets generated from the lungs of deceased pangolins reported by Liu et al.

At the same time, the nascent field of metagenomics began, with numerous studies highlighting the power of survey sequencing of DNA and RNA from samples as diverse as the human gut and Antarctic soil (1, 2) . As the diversity and size of such data sets expand, the utility of searching them with a novel sequence increases. Metametagenomic searches are currently underutilized. In principle, such searches would involve direct access to sequence data from a large set of metagenomic experiments on a terabyte scale, along with software able to search for similarity to a query sequence. We find that neither of these aspects of meta-metagenomic searches is infeasible with current data transfer and processing speeds. In this communication, we report the results of searching the recently described severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequence through a set of metagenomic data sets with the \"virome\" tag.",

All sequence data for this analysis were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website, with individual sequences downloaded through a web interface and metagenomic data sets downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) using the SRA-tools package (version 2.9.1). The latter sequence data were downloaded as .sra files using the prefetch tool, with extraction to readable format (.fasta.gz) using the NCBI fastq-dump tool. Each of these manipulations can fail some fraction of the time. Obtaining the sequences can fail due to network issues, while extraction in readable format occasionally fails for unknown reasons. Thus, we developed a set of scripts implementing a workflow that continually requests .sra files with ncbi-prefetch until at least some type of file is obtained, followed by attempts to unpack into .fasta.gz format until one such file is obtained from each .sra file. Metagenomic data sets for analysis were chosen through a keyword search of the SRA descriptions for \"virome\" and downloaded between 27 January 2020 and 31 January 2020. We note that the \"virome\" keyword search will certainly not capture every metagenomic data set with viral sequences, and likewise not capture every virus in the short sequence read archive. Despite these clear limitations, the \"virome\" keyword search identified a broad and diverse set of experimental data sets for further analysis. With up to 16 threads running simultaneously, total download time (prefetch) was approximately 2 days. Similar time was required for conversion to gzipped fasta files. A total of 9,014 sequence data sets were downloaded and converted to fasta.gz files. Most files (as expected) contained large numbers of reads, while a small fraction contained very little data (only a few reads or reads of at most a few base pairs). The total data set consists of 2.5 TB of compressed sequence data corresponding to approximately 10 13 bases.",

For rapid identification of close matches among large numbers of metagenomic reads, we used a simple dictionary based on the SARS-CoV-2 sequence (our query sequence for SARS-CoV-2 was GenBank accession no. MN908947.3) and its reverse complement, querying every 8th k-mer along the individual reads for matches to the sequence. As a reference, and to benchmark the workflow further, we included several additional sequences in the query (vaccinia virus, an arbitrary segment of an influenza virus isolate, the full sequence of bacteriophage P4, and a number of putative polinton sequences from Caenorhabditis briggsae). The relatively small group of k-mers being queried (\u03fd10 6 ) allows a rapid search for homologs. This was implemented in a Python script run using the PyPy accelerated interpreter. We stress that this is by no means the most comprehensive or fastest search for large data sets. However, it is more than sufficient to rapidly find any closely matching sequence (with the downloading and conversion of the data, rather than the search, being rate limiting). While the high degree of conservation between isolates of individual coronaviruses and between related coronaviruses (3, 4) facilitates this very simple approach to pattern matching for discovery of closely related viruses in this family, alternative approaches with more-sensitive matching algorithms for other gene or virus families would require only minimally expanded computing resources (5) .",

We were most interested in viruses with highly similar sequences, as these would likely be most useful in forming hypotheses about the origin and pathology of the recent human virus. We thus set a threshold requiring matching of a perfect 32-nucleotide segment with a granularity of 8 nucleotides in the search (i.e., interrogating the complete database of k-mers from the virus with k-mers starting at nucleotide 1, 9, 17, 25, 33 of each read from the metagenomic data for a perfect match). This would catch any perfect match of 39 nucleotides or greater (regardless of phasing relative to the 8-base search granularity), with some homologies as short as 32 nucleotides captured depending on the precise phasing of the read.",

Together the data sets included information from 9,014 NCBI Short Read Archive entries with (in total) 6.2 \u03eb 10 10 individual reads and 8.4 \u03eb 1,012 bp. Despite the relatively large mass of data, the 32-nucleotide k-mer match remains a stringent measure, with spurious matches to the \u03f330-kb SARS-CoV-2 genome expected at only 1 in 3 \u03eb 10 14 . Positive matches among the metagenomic data sets analyzed were relatively rare, with the vast majority of data sets (8,994/9,014 or 99.8%) showing no matched 32-mers to SARS-CoV-2. Of the data sets with matched k-mers, one was from a synthetic mixture of viral sequences that included a feline alphacoronavirus (10), while the remaining were all from vertebrate animal sources.

From the quick k-mer search, an initial indicator could be inferred from the number of matching reads and k-mer match counts for those reads (Table 1;  see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). For the SARS-CoV-2 matches among the available metagenomic data sets, the strongest and most abundant matches in these analyses came from the pangolin lung metaviromes. The matches were observed throughout the SARS-CoV-2 query sequence, and many of the matching reads showed numerous matching 32-mer sequences. The vast majority of matches were in two lung is also shown. Note that the pangolin metavirome similarity trace is not directly comparable to the bat coronavirus similarity traces, because the former uses read data for calculation, whereas the latter uses reference genomes. samples-lung07 and lung 08 -with small numbers of matches in two additional lung data sets, lung02 and lung09 (15) . No matches were detected for seven additional lung data sets, and no matches were seen in eight spleen samples and a lymph node sample (15) . Further analysis of coverage and homology through alignment of the metagenomic data sets revealed an extensive, if incomplete, coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1A to C). Percent nucleotide similarity can be calculated for pangolin metavirome reads aligning to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1b) , and these segmental homologies consistently showed strong matches, approaching (but still overall weaker than) the similarity of the closest known bat coronavirus (RaTG13). A provisional comparison of synonymous differences at the nucleotide level between the pangolin reads, bat coronavirus RaTG13, and SARS-CoV-2 was also feasible for genes where pangolin sequences were available and readily aligned. Many synonymous (generally codon third base) changes were visible in such comparisons ( Fig. S2 and S3 ). Comparisons of RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2 revealed synonymous changes at 10% of conserved amino acid residues, while comparisons of the aggregate (but incomplete) pangolin reads indicated synonymous changes at 23% of conserved amino acid residues. Within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (16) , these values are 26% and 34%, respectively.",

Thus, changes in these amino acid sequences, as previously described (17) and shown for comparison in Fig. S4 could be expected to influence interactions with the human ACE-2 receptor. In the case of the pangolin sequences, amino acid changes relative to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD seem to be, for the most part, located outside of the ACE-2 interface, with the exception of two residues (417 and 498) at the interface (17, 18) .

            "text": "Conclusions. Meta-metagenomic searching can provide unique opportunities to understand the distribution of nucleic acid sequences in diverse environmental niches. As metagenomic data sets proliferate and as both the need and capability to identify pathogenic agents through sequencing increase, meta-metagenomic searching may prove extremely useful in tracing the origins and spreading of causative agents. In the example we present in this paper, such a search identifies a number of niches with sequences matching the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These analyses raise a number of relevant points for the origin of SARS-CoV-2. Before describing the details of these points, however, it is important to stress that while environmental, clinical, and animal-based sequencing is valuable in understanding how viruses traverse the animal ecosphere, static sequence distributions cannot be used to construct the full transmission history of a virus among different biological niches. So even if the closest relative of a virus-causing disease in species X were to be found in species Y, we cannot define the source of the outbreak or the direction(s) of transmission. As some viruses may move more than once between hosts, the sequence of a genome at any time may reflect a history of selection and drift in several different host species. This point is also accentuated in the microcosm of our searches for this work. When we originally obtained the SARS-CoV-2 sequence from the posted work of Wu et al. (3), we recapitulated their result that bat-SL-CoVZC45 was the closest related sequence in NCBI's nonredundant (nr/nt) database. In our screen of metavirome data sets, we observed several pangolin metavirome sequences, which were not in the NCBI nr/nt database at the time, that are more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than bat-SL-CoVZC45. An assumption that the closest relative of a sequence identifies the origin would at that point have transferred the extant model to zoonosis from pangolin instead of bat. To complicate such a model, an additional study from Zhou et al. (4) described a previously unpublished coronavirus sequence, designated RaTG13 with much stronger homology to SARS-CoV-2 than either bat-SL-CoVZC45 or the pangolin reads from Liu et al. (15) . While this observation certainly shifts the discussion (legitimately) toward a possible bat-borne intermediate in the chain leading to SARS-CoV-2, it remains difficult to determine if any of these are true intermediates in the chain of infectivity.",

The pangolins appear to have died from lung-related illness, which may have involved a SARS-CoV-2-homologous virus. Notably, however, two of the deceased pangolin lungs had much lower SARS-CoV-2 signals, while seven showed no signal, with sequencing depths in the various lungs roughly comparable. Although it remains possible that the SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus was the primary cause of death for these animals, it is also possible (as noted by Liu et al.

Matthew Wong and colleagues bring up the homology to the pangolin metagenomic data sets in this thread and appear to have encountered it through a more targeted search than ours (this study has since been posted online on bioRxiv [19] ). As noted by Wong et al. (19) , the spike region includes a segment of \u03f3200 nucleotides encompassing the RBD where the inferred divergence between RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 dramatically increases. This region is of interest, as it is a key determinant of viral host range and under heavy selection (20) . The observed spike region divergence indeed includes a substantial set of nonsynonymous differences (Fig. S2  and S3) . Notably, while reads from the pangolin lung data sets mapped to this region do not show a similar increase in variation relative to SARS-CoV-2, we also did not observe a significant drop in variation between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin sequences in this region (Fig. S2 and S3) . Instead, variation in the region is comparable to numerous other conserved regions of the spike and to the viral genome as a whole. While Wong et al. (19) and others (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) raised the model that recombination occurred in the RBD region in the derivation of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of a singular dip in the landscape of pangolin-SARS-CoV-2 variation in the region would seem counterintuitive were SARS-CoV-2 a result of a localized recombination between a close relative of RaTG13 and a close relative of the putative pangolin coronaviruses under consideration. Thus alternative models for the observed sequence variation seem important to consider and indeed parsimonious, including that of selection acting on the RaTG13 sequences in bats or another intermediate host resulting in a rapid variation of the amino acids at the highly critical virus-receptor interface. Overall, definitive conclusions regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses will remain difficult with limited sequencing data and without knowledge of evolutionary trajectories in different lineages (29, 30) .",

            "text": "A number of literature contributions now discuss the potential role for bats, pangolins, and other possible progenitor/intermediate species in derivation of SARS-CoV-2 from different approaches and perspectives, with a diversity of approaches and interpretations in understanding the origin of the virus. In particular, there has been extensive discussion and debate about the possible pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 (19, (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) . These studies provide useful insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 but have limitations and uncertainty in drawing conclusions regarding the viral origin, as most studies were mainly performed through sequence-based comparison and simulation. Thus, better understanding of the current pandemic requires additional information on investigational, experimental, and epidemiological levels that may resolve questions of origin and of preventing the reemergence of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens. Nevertheless, the availability of numerous paths (both targeted and agnostic) toward identification of natural niches for pathogenic sequences, including our meta-metagenomic search, will remain useful to the scientific community and to public health, as will vigorous sharing of ideas, data, and discussion of potential origins and modes of spread for epidemic pathogens.",
