Infections can also result in lower respiratory tract illness including bronchiolitis and pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised individuals, infants, and older adults [1].

The number of HCoV tests submitted to NREVSS per week varied seasonally, with the testing peak occurring each year in winter, generally between December and March (Fig. 1\nA). Overall HCoV testing increased during the three years (Fig. 1A). The percent of HCoV positive tests varied throughout each year, and also peaked each year between December and March. The percent positive varied annually by HCoV species (Fig. 1B). HCoV-OC43 demonstrated a distinct peak each of the three years, with a less pronounced peak in 2016. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 demonstrated similar patterns to one another; both had a small peak in 2015 and larger peaks in 2016, although only HCoV-NL63 had a small peak in 2017. HCoV-229E showed a slight peak in 2015, no peak in 2016 and a relatively large peak in 2017 (Fig. 1B). The highest percent positive for any single species was 7.6% of tests positive for HCoV-OC43 in the week beginning December 31, 2016. Across each census region, minimal differences in seasonal and annual patterns of percentage of tests positive for each HCoV species were seen compared to national data (Fig. 2\n). The most notable difference was in the percentage of positive HCoV-OC43 tests during the 2016\u20132017 season, with the West region showing a peak percent positive of 5.0% and the Midwest region showing a peak percent positive of 12.4%.",

HCoV-OC43 was the most commonly detected HCoV with 2.2% of all tests positive. Different HCoV species predominated in different years; HCoV-OC43 appeared to peak annually, while HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-229E showed more variability, with distinct peaks in one or two of the three years studied. This is consistent with previously published site-specific data indicating that individual species may only demonstrate peak activity every 2\u20133 years [[10], [11]].",

HCoV-229E has previously been reported as disproportionately affecting immunocompromised individuals relative to the other HCoV species [4], possibly affecting the median reported age at infection. HCoV-NL63 showed the lowest median age of infection, and has been shown to be associated with croup in young children [13], which may lower the average age of infection. Non-HCoV viral co-detections were seen in 30% of specimens positive for HCoV, and 3.3% of specimens had two or more co-detected viral species. The clinical impact of coronaviruses in co-detections is not fully understood, with prior studies reporting both increased and unchanged morbidity and mortality with respiratory viral co-detections [14]. Single infections with HCoVs have been associated with morbidity due to lower and upper respiratory tract infections [4], however Prill et al demonstrated that HCoVs were not found more frequently in children hospitalized for acute respiratory illness and/or fever than asymptomatic controls [15].",
