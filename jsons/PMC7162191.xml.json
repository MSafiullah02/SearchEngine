            "text": "The nucleolus is a dynamic subnuclear structure involved in ribosome subunit biogenesis, RNA processing, cell cycle regulation, cell growth and as a sensor of cell stress (Carmo\u2010Fonseca et al., 2000; Leung and Lamond, 2003; Rubbi and Milner, 2003; Andersen et al., 2005; Lam et al., 2005). Given that the nucleolus is crucial to the successful functioning of a cell it is no surprise that both animal and plant viruses target this structure, whether to recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus infection or usurp host cell function (Hiscox, 2002; 2003; Rowland and Yoo, 2003; Weidman et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004). Proteomic analysis revealed that the nucleolus is composed of over 400 proteins which can be grouped into discrete functional classes related to the activity of the nucleolus (Andersen et al., 2002; Leung et al., 2003). Predominant among these is nucleolin, which can account for approximately 10% of the protein content within the nucleolus. Nucleolin is a multi\u2010domain and multifunctional protein that has been shown to be involved in ribosome assembly, rRNA maturation, nucleo\u2010cytoplasmic transport and cell proliferation (Ginisty et al., 1998; Srivastava and Pollard, 1999). Nucleolin is highly phosphorylated with the potential to bind to multiple RNA targets and this may reflect its variety of functions (Ginisty et al., 1999). While mammalian nucleolin has a predicted molecular mass of approximately 77 kDa (depending on the species), the apparent molecular mass is between 100 and 110 kDa, and has been attributed to the amino acid composition of the N\u2010terminal domain, which is highly phosphorylated. Cell culture studies have shown that nucleolin is stable in proliferating cells, but undergoes self\u2010cleavage in quiescent cells (Chen et al., 1991) and has been shown in primary cells to be regulated at both the level of transcription and translation (Bicknell et al., 2005). Morphologically the nucleolus can be divided into a fibrillar centre (FC), a dense fibrillar component (DFC) and an outer granular component (GC), each with defined functions (Thiry and Lafontaine, 2005).",

For example, nucleolin associates with a variety of proteins including B23 (Li et al., 1996; Liu and Yung, 1999), the tumour suppressor protein p53 (Daniely et al., 2002), human La antigen (Intine et al., 2004), telomerase (Khurts et al., 2004) and also RNA (Serin et al., 1997; Allain et al., 2000; Ginisty et al., 2001). Any perturbations to a nucleolar protein, either in localization to the nucleolus or abundance, whether induced by infection, cellular disease or cell state (e.g. the cell cycle), is likely to have down stream consequences for host cell metabolism (Hiscox, 2002; Zimber et al., 2004; Andersen et al., 2005).",

Although the principal site of replication of this virus is the cytoplasm (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997), nevertheless one of the most abundant viral proteins produced during infection, nucleocapsid (N) protein, can localize to the cytoplasm and nucleolus in infected cells and cells expressing this protein from an expression vector (Hiscox et al., 2001; Wurm et al., 2001). N protein can also associate with nucleolin, a nucleolar protein (Chen et al., 2002). While nucleolar localization of N protein has also been described for the closely related arteriviruses (Rowland et al., 1999; Tijms et al., 2002; Rowland and Yoo, 2003; Yoo et al., 2003) and may thus be a common property of nidoviruses, in the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus N protein, nucleolar localization has not been observed in infected cells using antibodies to detect N protein (Rowland et al., 2005; You et al., 2005). Although it has been described in cells expressing N protein (Li et al., 2005), albeit with low frequency (You et al., 2005).",

Analysis of the protein by non\u2010reducing SDS\u2010PAGE revealed a monomeric form with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 55 kDa and a timeric form of approximately 165 kDa, the latter form not being present under reducing conditions (Chen et al., 2003). These data suggested several post\u2010translational modifications including disulphide bridge formation and phosphorylation (Chen et al., 2003). Although coronavirus N proteins have the potential to be phosphorylated at multiple residues, mass spectroscopic analysis of IBV (Chen et al., 2005) and also the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastro\u2010enteritis virus (TGEV) (Calvo et al., 2005) N proteins, indicated that relatively few sites were occupied. Analysis demonstrated that IBV N protein was phosphorylated at four sites, Ser190 and Ser192 and Thr378 and Ser379 (Chen et al., 2005). The majority of species were either mono\u2010 or biphosphorylated and mapped to predicted protein kinase A (PKA) in the case of Ser190 and ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK) in the case of Ser192 and casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation sites for both Thr378 and Ser379.",

N protein is involved in the control of virus RNA synthesis (Almazan et al., 2004; Schelle et al., 2005) and surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrated that phosphorylated N protein has a high affinity for viral RNA (Chen et al., 2005). IBV N protein has been shown to induce aberrant cytokinesis and delay cell growth (Wurm et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2002). SARS\u2010coronavirus N protein can activate the AP\u20101 transcription pathway (He et al., 2003), re\u2010organise actin and induce apoptosis (Surjit et al., 2004).

Given that the nucleolus is a multi\u2010protein complex, we hypothesized that viral interactions with the nucleolus would disrupt its morphology, which we defined as changes in the distribution of nucleolar proteins that alter the shape of the nucleolus as revealed by microscopy. Nucleolar morphology was examined during infection with IBV using confocal microscopy with fluorescently tagged nucleolar proteins as well transmission phase contrast microscopy (You et al., 2005). Two marker proteins were selected, B23 tagged C\u2010terminal to DsRed (DsRed\u2010B23) and nucleolin tagged C\u2010terminal to EGFP (EGFP\u2010nucleolin), and as described previously, using these techniques different regions of the nucleolus could be identified (You et al., 2005) (Fig. 1A). Under transmission phase contrast (and bright field analysis), the nucleolus is highly refractive due to the high protein content (Lam et al., 2005). The only area which is not highly refractive is the FC, which is enriched in nucleic acid; this appears as a less refractive area in the nucleolus (Fig. 1A). The FC and DFC are also apparent in cells expressing DsRed\u2010B23 and EGFP\u2010nucleolin (You et al., 2005). There was no change in the distribution of either EGFP (Fig. 1B) or DsRed (data not shown) in virus\u2010infected cells, and thus if any change in subcellular localization of the fusion protein was observed this could be attributed to the nucleolar marker protein. Vero cells expressing DsRed\u2010B23 were infected with IBV and the distribution of DsRed\u2010B23 examined at 12, 18 and 24 h post infection (pi) (Fig. 2). Together with transmission phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 2) the data indicated that the morphology of the nucleolus changed with time of infection 12 h pi. Prior to this time point there appeared to be no change in morphology.",

Three principal nucleolar morphologies were observed in virus\u2010infected cells. In approximately 64% of infected cells the nucleolus had the same apparent morphology to that of mock\u2010infected cells. Second, in approximately 23% of infected cells, there was a punctate distribution of EGFP\u2010nucleolin (Fig. 3A), which could be more closely observed through Z\u2010sectioning through the plane of the nucleolus (Fig. 3B). Third, in approximately 13% of infected cells, an increase in the apparent size of the FC (Fig. 3C) compared with mock\u2010infected cells (Fig. 3D). The diameter of the FCs between infected and mock\u2010infected cells were compared by fluorescent intensity (an example of this in infected cells is shown in Fig. 3E) and revealed that by examining 15 fields of view from three independent experiments, the average diameter of the FC in mock\u2010infected cells was 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m. In contrast, the average diameter of the FC in infected cells exhibiting the larger phenotype was 2.6 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5m.",

Vero cells were infected with IBV and nucleolar extracts purified at 24 h pi. The purity of nucleolar extracts was confirmed by visual microscopy (data not shown) and Western blot analysis of nucleolar material using marker proteins for the nucleolus (nucleolin) and the nucleus/nucleoplasm (Lamin B) (Fig. 4A). The results indicated that nucleolin was enriched in the purified nucleolar material compared with prior purification stages that contained increased levels of nuclei and nucleoplasm as shown by the increased detection of Lamin B in these samples. Thus both bright field microscopic analysis (data not shown) and Western blot indicated that the nucleolar preparations were enriched in nucleoli. The protein content from equivalent numbers of nucleoli (as determined by counting the numbers of nucleoli using bright field microscopy) was separated using denaturing SDS\u2010PAGE on a 4\u201312% gradient gel (Invitrogen) (Fig. 4B). Comparison of the two proteomes indicated that novel protein species were present in nucleolar proteomes from virus\u2010infected cells (indicated by the arrows labelled with the numeral 1), and that the abundance of some cellular nucleolar proteins was altered between virus\u2010infected and mock\u2010infected cells (indicated by the arrows labelled with the numeral 2). Western blot analysis using either antibody to N protein or nucleolin confirmed that N protein was present in the nucleolar extracts from infected cells but not mock\u2010infected cells and that there was a slight increase in the amount of nucleolin between infected or mock\u2010infected cells (Fig. 4B). However, although proteins extracted from equivalent number of nucleoli were analysed, quantification of the relative amounts of protein in these structures between mock and infected cells is problematic as variations in nucleolar size and density are difficult to control. A change in the morphology of the nucleolus was observed in IBV\u2010infected cells using EGFP\u2010nucleolin as a marker protein (e.g. Fig. 3B), leading to the prediction that the levels of nucleolin might increase in virus\u2010infected cells, which was observed in Fig. 4B.",

            "text": "To test the hypothesis that interaction of a virus with the nucleolus can lead to the redistribution of nucleolar proteins we examined the localization of the tumour suppressor protein p53. The reasons for choosing this protein is that coronavirus infection can result in changes to the cell cycle and cell growth (Wurm et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2002; Chen and Makino, 2004) and that the coronavirus N protein (among others) can mediate these effects (Wurm et al., 2001; Timani et al., 2005). In addition, disruption of the nucleolus has been reported to stabilize p53 as part of a response to cell stress, with the prediction that viruses may disrupt p53 to prevent this response from occurring (Rubbi and Milner, 2003; Yuan et al., 2005). In mock\u2010infected cells, p53 was located in the nucleolus/nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 5A); however, in virus\u2010infected cells p53 was redistributed from the nucleolus/nucleus to the cytoplasm and was punctate in distribution (Fig. 5B and C). We confirmed that the nucleolus was still intact in these cells using transmission phase contrast (Fig. 5C). Western blot analysis indicated that there was no change in the amount of p53 between mock and infected cells at 24 h pi (Fig. 5D).",

The polyclonal antibody used to detect IBV was raised in rabbits against virus and therefore, could be predicted to detect (at least) the spike, membrane and envelope surface glycoproteins as well as the N protein. Given that N protein can reduce cell growth (Wurm et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2002) we hypothesized that N protein might be responsible for sequestration of p53. To test this, we expressed EGFP\u2010IBV N protein in Vero cells and examined for colocalization with p53; however, none was observed (Fig. 6A). Given that N protein is probably part of the virus replication complex, then N protein may interact with p53 in the context of virus\u2010infected cells. Therefore, we examined the interaction of p53 with EGFP\u2010IBV N protein in infected cells. The data showed that both p53 (red) and IBV proteins (blue) colocalized (as shown by the purple signal, arrowed), and the EGFP\u2010IBV N protein was recognized (in part) by the anti\u2010IBV polyclonal antibody (cyan signal) (Fig. 6B). If p53 and EGFP\u2010IBV N protein colocalized then we would expect a yellow signal; however, similar to EGFP\u2010IBV N protein expressed alone, there was no obvious colocalization of EGFP\u2010IBV N protein and p53 apart from an isolated area proximal to the peri\u2010nuclear region (arrowed yellow) (Fig. 6B). However, colocalization between EGFP\u2010IBV N protein, p53 and IBV proteins detected using the polyclonal antibody (white signal) can also be observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6C). The redistribution of p53 may account for the observed reduction in cell growth observed in cells expressing N protein (Wurm et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2002).",

The data indicated that while EGFP\u2010IBV N protein and PI colocalized in many parts of the nucleolus, there were some areas of the nucleolus not occupied by N protein (in red). Further magnification of these cells at \u00d7 63 and enhanced \u00d7 4.5 revealed that indeed N protein occupied less area of the nucleolus than that stained by PI (Fig. 7B, lower images). This finding was confirmed by orthogonal reconstruction (Fig. 7C) of the region of the cell delineated in Fig. 7B, lower image, indicated by the white vertical line. On the basis of this data we hypothesized that N protein localized to the DFC. In order to test this prediction we analysed the distribution of N protein in the nucleolus in more detail using a plasmid which expressed a fluorescent protein (ECFP) fused N\u2010terminal to a mutant of N protein (pECFP\u2010NR1+2) which localizes to the nucleolus and nucleus but not cytoplasm and the nucleolar marker protein DsRed\u2010B23. As stated above B23 provides a marker for the DFC and is absent from the FC and GC, and therefore provided the nucleus is visible, these domains can also be visualized. Cells were cotransfected with pECFP\u2010NR1+2 and pDsRed\u2010B23 and fixed at 24 h post transfection. The confocal microscope was used to take approximately 0.41 \u00b5m sections through the nucleus/nucleolus (Fig. 7D, note ECFP false coloured green). As can be observed, DsRed\u2010B23 localizes predominately to the DFC. ECFP\u2010NR1+2 localizes predominately to the nucleus and nucleolus and more specifically to the DFC. Interestingly the apparent diameter of the FC in this nucleolus was approximately 2.0 \u00b5m, which reflects the diameter of the nucleolus with the large phenotype observed in infected cells. Therefore, we postulate that nucleolar localization of N protein causes a disruption to the FC.",
