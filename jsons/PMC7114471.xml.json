Epidemiologic factors also reduce vaccine efficacy; foals are often infected for the first time at a very young age, despite the presence of maternal antibodies (Gilkerson et al., 1998). Conventional vaccines may mitigate clinical signs of respiratory disease and abortion and decrease viral shedding, but have not been found to prevent infection, to stimulate long-lasting immunity or to protect against the neurologic syndrome caused by EHV-1 infection, equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) (Goodman et al., 2006, Patel et al., 2003). Treatment of horses with clinical disease has traditionally been limited to supportive care. More recently antiviral drugs (including acyclovir and valacyclovir) have been investigated, but poor bioavailability, lack of controlled clinical evidence, and extensive cost of treatment have precluded their wide use in the field (Bentz et al., 2006, Garre et al., 2009, Garre et al., 2007, Henninger et al., 2007, Maxwell et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The failure of conventional drugs and vaccines to produce the desired level of protection has led to the investigation of alternative technologies for prophylaxis and treatment of EHV-1-associated clinical disease. One novel approach that has shown promise both in vitro and in other species in vivo is the use of RNA interference. RNA interference involves the recruitment of endogenous or exogenous short interfering RNA (siRNA) into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) resulting in degradation of target mRNA (Stevenson, 2004). For human diseases, in vivo studies in Rhesus macaques showed a beneficial effect of RNA interference in both prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, including significant decreases in fever, viral load and lung pathology (Li et al., 2005). Moreover, clinical trials in humans were started using siRNA in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections (Haasnoot et al., 2007). For equine viruses, in vitro studies have shown that siRNA can reduce viral titers in cell cultures infected with equine arteritis virus (Heinrich et al., 2009), African horse sickness virus (Stassen et al., 2007) or Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (O\u2019Brien, 2007). More specifically for EHV-1, RNA interference has been effective both in vitro and in vivo, as assessed by a reduction in plaque formation in cell cultures and a reduction in clinical signs (weight loss) and viral replication within lung tissue in a murine model of EHV-1 infection (Fulton et al., 2009).",

These factors were either not controlled or not known in this study, and might have influenced the results in ways that are not quantifiable. The epidemiological characteristics of EHV-1 infection also introduce the potential for variability. EHV-1 is endemic in equine populations worldwide, infecting foals at very young ages (Foote et al., 2004) and establishing latent infections that can recrudesce in times of stress (Slater et al., 1994). The stress associated with transporting the study horses from a herd setting into an isolation unit might cause recrudescence of latent virus, possibly confounding some of the results. Although we examined the status of the horses to exclude acute recrudescence (by SN titers and clinical observations), reactivation of latent virus or more severe expression of the disease by co-infection(s) cannot formally be excluded. Our random allocation of the horses would have helped to distribute such confounding evenly between the two groups.",

On day 3 pi, this horse developed nasal discharge of a character and volume different from that observed in all other horses and from what is typical after EHV-1 infection. Mucopurulent, blood-tinged nasal discharge was produced in very large amounts. At that time a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained and cultured for Streptococcus equi subspecies equi, but was negative. Additionally, nasal swabs and submandibular lymph node samples obtained post-mortem were negative for S. equi on PCR and nasal swabs were negative for equine influenza on PCR. Virus isolated from this horse was sequenced and was identical to the strain administered in this study (rAb4). This horse was one of the two sigB3/siOri2 horses that developed neurologic disease, and alone accounted for extended virus isolation from PBMCs on days 10, 12 and 14 in this group. We were unable to document intercurrent disease, viral recrudescence or viral mutation to justify subject exclusion; the impact of this one horse's unusually severe signs was much greater than it would have been in a larger population.",

Infection with neurovirulent EHV-1 strains results in higher levels of viremia compared to non-neurovirulent strains (Allen and Breathnach, 2006), and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the DNA polymerase gene has been identified to account for this increased level of viremia (Goodman et al., 2007, Nugent et al., 2006, Van de Walle et al., 2009). Characteristics of the host's immune system including a slow rise in EHV-1 specific antibody titers and a low concentration of EHV-1 specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes prior to infection have also been implicated as risk factors for horses developing EHM (Allen, 2008, Allen and Breathnach, 2006, Henninger et al., 2007). Because all horses in this study were inoculated with the same EHV-1 strain, the neurovirulent rAb4, we expected that both temperature and viremia would be decreased in the sigB3/siOri2-treated group. The findings in the present study showed that neurological disease was mitigated in horses with the EHV-1 specific siRNAs compared to the control group, but no significant reduction in viremia or temperature was observed upon sigB3/siOri2 treatment. There was also no difference in viremia or SN titers of neurologic versus non-neurologic horses, irrespective of the treatment the horses received. These data considered together suggest a much more complex pathogenesis of EHM than our current understanding provides.",

Much remains to be learned about the cellular uptake and intracellular kinetics of siRNA. Factors thought to influence the duration of effect of siRNA include the rate of cell division and degradation of siRNA by endogenous nucleases. In one in vivo murine study looking at these factors, siLuc showed activity of up to 4 weeks in non-dividing liver cells but only 10 days in rapidly dividing tumors cells (Bartlett and Davis, 2006). There are currently no data pertaining to the kinetics of our specific siRNAs in equine epithelial cells; as new research is conducted the effectiveness of administration protocols will gradually be improved.",

Currently, experiments are planned to chemically modify the sigB3/siOri2 siRNAs and these will be evaluated in experimentally EHV-1-infected horses by administering a higher intranasal dose every 12 h for 3\u20134 days in the near future.",

Although there was no significant difference in viral shedding and viremia between the treated and control groups, euthanasia necessitated by intractable neurologic signs was significantly reduced after application of EHV-1 specific siRNA, which had been shown previously to interfere with virus replication in vitro and in a murine model of EHV-1 infection (Fulton et al., 2009). Given the success seen thus far with the use of siRNA in other models of respiratory disease, we believe that modifications of the siRNAs and/or the dosing regimen used in this study would result in improved outcomes with respect to viremia and virus shedding, and a move towards the ultimate goal of an effective siRNA treatment for this devastating disease. Although progress has been made in recent years towards a better understanding of the disease, additional research to elucidate the relative contribution of viral, host and environmental factors is clearly warranted.",
