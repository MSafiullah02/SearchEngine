            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious disease of swine characterized by up to 100% mortality in suckling piglets (Laude et al., 1993). The clinical symptoms include acute diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. Pigs of all ages and categories are susceptible. In seronegative herds, TGE can cause devastating economic losses (Saif and Wesley, 1999; Ren et al., 2010a, Ren et al., 2010b; Yin et al., 2010). The virus responsible for TGE (TGEV) has a glycoprotein surface envelope and positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28.5 kb (Ortego et al., 2002). The virus consists of four structural proteins: spike (S), small membrane (sM or E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Spaan et al., 1988, Saif and Wesley, 1999, Penzes et al., 2001). The S protein is a large transmembrane surface glycoprotein that induces virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 1986, Laude et al., 1987, Su\u00f1\u00e9 et al., 1990); the N protein, together with genomic RNA, forms the viral nucleocapsid (Su\u00f1\u00e9 et al., 1990, Cavanagh, 1994); and the sM protein regulates virion assembly and release (Laude et al., 1990). The M protein is the most abundant component of the coronavirus particle (Rottier, 1995). Roughly one-third of the M protein assumes a topology where part of the endo domain constitutes the fourth transmembrane segment, thereby positioning the carboxy terminus on the exterior portion of the virion (Risco et al., 1995, Masters, 2006). It has been suggested that the M protein induces innate immunity including interferon production (Charley and Laude, 1988, Laude et al., 1992).",

Phage display yields billions of heterologous fusion peptides that are expressed on the surfaces of filamentous bacteriophage (Scott and Smith, 1990). Inasmuch as each phage expresses only one fusion peptide, the technology permits high throughput panning of a phage library with the intent of identifying single phage particles with the capacity to bind a target protein. This permits epitope mapping and easy purification at marginal costs. In the current study, three TGEV M-binding phage and the concomitant peptides were identified from a phage display library. Results indicate the ability of these peptides to function as TGEV-specific diagnostic reagents. One peptide was further studied for its potential as an inhibitor of TGEV infectivity.",

Albeit safer, inactivated vaccines provide less protection. As such, accurate diagnostic tests are needed to better effect TGE prevention and therapy. Phage display and biopanning are powerful methods for identifying key ligands within large target antigens that may be involved in protection and/or diagnosis (Wu et al., 2011). This technology has been used for identifying receptor binding domains (RBDs) in TGEV that may interact with its pAPN cellular receptor (Ren et al., 2011a). It has also been used for identifying immunogenic proteins in pig sera from convalescent animals with a history of Salmonella typhimurium infection (Meyer et al., 2012), and for targeting tissues like bone-marrow dendritic cells and kidney, liver, lung, spleen and visceral adipose tissues (Jung et al., 2012).",

Given the possibility of identifying GST-binding phage, we included additional panning steps using purified recombinant GST as the target to remove phage that did not specifically target the rTGEV-M protein.

Further, even using serum from animals boosted 3X with rTGEV-M, the phage-ELISA appeared more sensitive. Clearly, targeting the M protein rather than the whole virus could sacrifice sensitivity. Although we demonstrated specificity in phage and peptide binding to rTGEV-M, we have not determined how well-exposed the binding region is to the surface of the virus. As such, using the M protein as the biopanning agent is probably not as effective as using whole virus.

Plaque-reduction assays showed that TGEV infectivity decreased only when virus was pre-treated with the peptide. In contrast, when the pepTGEV-M7 was incubated with ST cells alone or with TGEV-infected ST cells, no inhibitory effect was observed. This is an expected outcome given that rTGEV-M was used to pan for bioreactive phage and this protein is not present on the surface of or within ST cells. Collectively the data presented here are consistent with pepTGEV-M7 binding to the surface of the virus and either interfering with the ability of the virus to invade the cell or generate progeny virus.
