The magnetic nanoparticles were surface-coated with anti-influenza A nucleoprotein (\u03b1-A-NP) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), pre-loaded in a micromixer, and incubated with purified viral particle samples for 5 min (Figure 1, A). The purification of nanoparticle\u2013virus complexes was realized by washing out non-specific interferences when an external magnetic field was applied for 2 min (Figure 1, B). After washing, the direct-conjugated R-phycoerythrin (PE) developing mAbs (\u03b1-A-NP\u2013PE mAbs) was transported into the micromixer to incubate with the nanoparticle\u2013virus complexes for 5 min (Figure 1, C). The non-binding interferences were washed away and the purification of the nanoparticle\u2013virus-developing mAb complexes with the similar process. Finally, an optical detection module was used to detect the optical signal of the purified nanoparticle\u2013virus-developing mAbs complexes (Figure 1, D).

In this study, the circular diameter of the micromixer was reduced from 15,000 \u03bcm to 2,600 \u03bcm, indicating that the working PDMS membrane area was also reduced. Consequently, both positive and negative forces were provided for efficient mixing. Therefore, a negative gauge pressure of \u2212 80 kPa and a positive gauge pressure of 10 psi were used in this study.",

Secondly, the PDMS surface with a thin layer of the Pluronic P123 was layered with PAA (MW 100,000, 1% [wt/vol], in deionized [DI] water) for 15 min. Thirdly, the PDMS surface was coated with a PEI solution (MW 75,000, 0.25% [wt/vol], in DI water) for 15 min. This sequence of surface modification was repeated twice to obtain the desired thickness of polyelectrolyte multilayers and the native hydrophobic PDMS surface could be surface-modified to hydrophilic.36\n",

Based on the process reported in the literature,37 the method of MnFeO nanoparticles synthesis is in hydrophobic phase. Therefore, the hydrophobic MnFeO nanoparticles must be transferred to the hydrophilic phase and then conjugated with influenza A anti-body. In a typical synthesis procedure, iron (III) acetylacetonate [Fe(acac)3, 1.4 g, Aldrich], manganese (II) acetate [Mn(ac)2, 0.346 g, Alfa Aesar], oleic acid (90%, 3.36 mL, Aldrich) and trioctylamine (98%, 15 mL, Aldrich) were first mixed in a two-neck round bottom (RB) flasks (precursor 1) and heated up to 305 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 33 \u00b0C/min and maintained at this temperature for 30 min, and then reduced to 270 \u00b0C. The average particle size of nanoparticles obtained in this treatment was 40 nm (Figure 3\n, A). Another solution (precursor 2) with a total volume of 12 mL was prepared in a separate RB by mixing Fe(acac)3 (0.84 g), Mn(ac)2 (0.208 g), oleic acid (90%, 6.12 mL) and trioctylamine (98%, 5 mL) and heated up to 150 \u00b0C, and then maintained at this temperature for 20 min. The precursor 2 was then added into the precursor 1 and heated up to 305 \u00b0C for 30 min, and then reduced to 270 \u00b0C. The process of adding the precursor 2 and temperature programming was repeated four times and particle size obtained in each step was 57, 63, 75 and 95 nm, respectively (Figure 3, A). The final products were separated by 8000-rpm centrifugation for 10 min, washed three times with ethanol and dispersed in toluene.37, 38 A series of transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the magnetic MnFe2O4 nanoparticles are shown in Figure 3. The size of the synthesized nanoparticles can be fine-tuned to an average size of 98 \u00b1 19.5 nm with this approach.",

In the unmixed state, C+ shows significant difference from low to high ink concentration; after mixing, C+ value is the same for all area within the mixing chamber.

The optimization of the micromixer was also explored by measuring the mixing index at different driving frequencies (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 Hz, respectively) under an applied gauge pressure of \u2212 80 kPa and 10 psi. As shown in Figure 5, C, the experimental data revealed that a mixing index of as high as 97% can be realized after mixing for 2 seconds. The micromixer was then determined to be actuated at 4.0 Hz with an applied gauge pressure of both \u2212 80 kPa and 10 psi for performing the nanoparticle immunoassay.

            "text": "Another unique feature of this study involved successfully applying the appropriate PDMS surface modification methods for the MnFe2O4 nanoparticles. The final nanoparticles hydrophilic process caused them to carry a positive charge, thereby showing non-specific adhesion in the micromixer chamber. It even caused a high background signal of approximately 708 mV, as shown in Supplemental Figure 2. Subsequently, P123, PAA, and PEI were applied, and the PDMS surface modification method also produced a positive charge in the micromixer chamber. By applying this LBL self-assembly structure, these nanoparticles can mix well in the micromixer and lower the background noise to 440 mV. The findings of this research provide a new approach for nanoparticle application of dynamic mixing in a microfluidic system. Many types of surface modification methods should be adapted for different nanoparticles from different synthesis processes. Other PDMS surface modification methods should also demonstrate their function after further testing and produce stronger dynamic nanoparticle mixing signals and lower background noise.46, 47\n",

            "text": "On average, the nanoparticles signal was twice stronger than that of the M450 micro-beads. To compare the signals between the M450 beads and the MnFe2O4 nanoparticles, the similar weight of beads/nanoparticles (approximately 6.1 \u03bcg per reaction) coated with \u03b1-A-NP mAbs (5 \u03bcg, as shown in section 2.4) were used. The difference in diameter between the two types of particles (4.5 \u03bcm for M450 beads versus 100 nm for nanoparticles) results in a difference of 2025 times in their surface areas. However, the number of applied M450 beads was totally 8.0 \u00d7 104, which was much less than the number of MnFe2O4 nanoparticles of the same weight (totally 2.2 \u00d7 109). These predicted results indicate that the nanoparticles contain approximately 10 times the reaction surface area of the M450 beads (1 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 109: 2025 \u00d7 8.0 \u00d7 104\n \u2248 10:1). Therefore, there are two aspects of this research requiring further discussion. First, the collection of magnetic nanoparticles should be performed by comparing it with previous work on M450 beads.19, 20 Although the fluorescence signals were located in the nanoparticles, as the merged images shown in Figures 6, A-G, the nanoparticles may not be completely focused for better signals. Second, the error bar of the signal from the nanoparticles shown in Figure 6, H is higher than M450, and the background noise of 1 \u00d7 PBS control is also higher than the error bar of M450. Effective focusing and collection are the next concerns for applying dynamically mixed nanoparticles and combining dielectrophoresis; otherwise the AC electro-osmosis force may provide the additional force for nanoparticle collection.48, 49 In addition, a well-designed customer-made control system, which was composed of a temperature control module, an air compressor, several EMVs, and an optical detection module, might also reduce optical signal loss and automatically perform the entire diagnostic process.50 Note that in this study only the limited number of clinical samples was applied and a much greater number of samples should need to be tested to fully validates this system for medical diagnosis in the near future.",

The employment of the nanoparticles increased the FIA signal by approximately two-fold when compared with commercial 4.5-\u03bcm magnetic beads because of the large surface-to-volume ratio of the nanoparticles. This microfluidic system can automatically perform an immunoassay to detect the influenza infections within 20 min, thus showing promise for rapidly diagnosing infectious diseases.",
