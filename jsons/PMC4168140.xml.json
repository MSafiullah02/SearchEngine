            "text": "Picornaviruses are a family of positive-sense single stranded RNA viruses within the order Picornavirales [1]. They can cause intestinal, respiratory, neurological, cardiac, hepatic, mucocutaneous, and systemic diseases of varying severity in humans and animals [2]. Although different picornaviruses show various degrees of relatedness, all picornaviruses share a similar genomic organization, which consists of a covalently linked 5\u2032 terminal protein called VPg (Viral Protein genome-linked), a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a large open reading frame (ORF), a 3\u2032 UTR and a poly(A) tail of variable length [2], [3]. The genomic RNA of picornaviruses harbor several distinct cis-active RNA elements which are required for viral RNA replication; an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5\u2032UTR, a cis-replication element (CRE) within the ORF [3]\u2013[6] or the 5\u2032 UTR [7], the 3\u2032 UTR, and the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail [3]. Currently, five different types of IRES element [8] that direct cap-independent translation initiation on the viral RNA to produce the polyprotein have been identified from the primary sequence, secondary structure, location of the initiation codon and activity in different cell types [9], [10]. In most picornaviruses, the polyprotein encoded by the ORF is cleaved into four structural viral particle proteins (VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1) and seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D). In addition, the members of the genera Cardiovirus, Aphthovirus, Erbovirus, Kobuvirus, Teschovirus, Senecavirus and Sapelovirus possess a leader (L) protein at the N-terminus of polyprotein [11].",

Both of these sapelovirus subgroups possess two common domains that can form a stem-loop structure (Domains X and Y [Figure 5B\u20135D]). The V13-like group contained a third stem loop region (termed domain Z [Figure 5B, 5C]), located upstream of domain Y (Figure 5B, 5C). In the 3 Korean strains and YC2011 strain, an interaction of 8 nucleotides between the same sequence region within the loop of domain Z (nt 7485 to 7492 in the KS05151 strain) and the loop of domain X (nt 7549 to 7556 in the KS05151 strain), forming a loop-loop intramolecular \u201ckissing\u201d RNA interaction, appeared to be possible (Figure 5B). The V13 strain had a potential interaction of 7 nucleotides between the loops of domain Z (nt 7411 to 7416) and domain X (nt 7475 to 7480), forming a similar intramolecular \u201ckissing\u201d RNA interaction (Figure 5C). The csh-like group sequence was not predicted to form a loop-loop intramolecular \u201ckissing\u201d RNA interaction due to the lack of the domain Z (Figure 5A, 5D).",

In order to identify whether PSV species have a cloverleaf RNA structure at the 5\u2032UTR, the complete 5\u2032UTR needs to be known. However, the sequences of the known PSV strains including the English V13, and the Chinese csh and YC2011 strains lacked the 5\u2032 terminal UU residues, which were necessary for picornavirus RNA replication [39]. Using 5\u2032 RACE, an additional 25 nucleotides including 5\u2032 terminal UU residues were identified compared to the recently sequenced Chinese YC2011 strain [29]. Unlike enteroviruses and rhinoviruses [38], the Korean PSV strains had no cloverleaf RNA structure at the 5\u2032UTR. However, two conserved stem-loop motifs were present within the 5\u2032-terminal 80 nucleotides (Figure 4). The role of these structures is not known but they may be expected to play a role in RNA replication analogous to the cloverleaf structure of the enteroviruses [38], [39]. Overall the 5\u2032UTRs of PSVs were quite short, for example the poliovirus 5\u2032UTR is about 740 nucleotides in length while the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 5\u2032UTR is over 1300 nucleotides [40].",

            "text": "In general, picornavirus 3\u2032 UTRs vary in length between 40 and 165 nucleotides. The length of the 3\u2032 UTR in PSV is 82 nucleotides (strain V13, YC2011, KS04105, KS05151 and KS055217) although a shorter sequence (68 nucleotides) was described for the csh strain [20]. In a previous report [12], PSV strain V13 was predicted to include three stem-loop structures in the region of the 3\u2032UTR using nine nucleotides of the terminal part of the 3D coding region. In the present study, the Korean viruses KS04105, KS05151 and KS055217 plus the Chinese YC2011 strain each appear to have these 3 stem-loop structures (X, Y and Z), but the csh strain showed only two stem-loop structures (X and Y) since the sequence was shorter. The domain Z, in which the stop codon (UGA) is located, is the most conserved region of the 3\u2032UTR within PSVs, whereas domains Y and X were considered more variable regions (Figure 5B, 5C), as they show heterogeneity in both length and nucleotide sequence. The differences between the 5 different PSV strains and the csh strain appear attributable to an incomplete 3\u2032 terminal sequence for the csh 3\u2032 UTR region. Moreover, five strains, except for the strain csh, were predicted to have an intramolecular kissing RNA interaction between the X and Z domains. Due to the lack of 3\u2032 terminal sequence of csh 3\u2032 UTR region, no intramolecular kissing RNA interaction could be predicted (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, the V13 strain showed intramolecular interaction of 7 nucleotides, but the three Korean and one Chinese strains had intramolecular interaction of 8 nucleotides. The 3\u2032 UTR plays an important role in picornavirus replication. Serial passage of mutant viruses in which such interactions were disrupted resulted in production of revertants in which the tertiary kissing interaction was restored, indicating the functional importance of the interaction in the enterovirus 3\u2032UTR [46]\u2013[50]. Further study is required to determine whether these regions are important for PSV replication using modifications of the relevant PSV nucleotide sequences.",

However, no putative CRE has yet been reported for viruses in the Sapelovirus, Kobuvirus, Erbovirus, Teschovirus, Avihepatovirus, Senecavirus and Tremovirus genera. The location of the CRE in the genomic RNA varies between the picornavirus genera. It is located in the coding region for 2C in enteroviruses [6], [36], for VP1 in species B rhinoviruses [32], for VP2 in species C rhinoviruses [38] and cardioviruses [52], for VP0 in parechoviruses [4] and for 3D of hepatoviruses [54]. In FMDV, the CRE is located just upstream of the IRES [7], [35]. In the present study, a putative CRE was located in the 2C coding region of all PSV strains. Generally, the AAACA motif is located in the loop of picornavirus CREs and the first and second A residues are involved in providing a template for the addition of uridine onto VPg [38], [39], [53], [55], [56]. In contrast to other known CREs, the PSV strains had two copies of the AAACA motif within the sequence CAAACATAATAAACAA. This indicated that one or both of these AAACA motifs may be involved in being a template for the addition of uridine onto VPg. Future functional analyses are needed to identify whether one or both motifs are templates for the uridylylation of VPg to make VPg-pU-pUOH.",
