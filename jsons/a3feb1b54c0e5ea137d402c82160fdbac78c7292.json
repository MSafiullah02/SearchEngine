The deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) was the most abundant species on the two burns the first 7 yr. Later the vegetation changes apparently produced a habitat less attractive to the deer mouse, while the red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) increased. Numbers of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), jumping mice (Zapus hudsonius), and cinereus shrews (Sorex cinereus) were low and erratic on all areas.

            "text": "Occasionally, wild fires burn relatively large areas of forest land, or controlled burning is used to promote tree reproduction; such fires materially change the habitat for all small mammal populations. Smith and Aldous ( 1947) examined the stomach content of 30 deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) from a jack pine slash area in the vicinity of the study. They found that 70% of the stomachs contained the remains of jack pine seeds. On prescribed jack pine burn areas in the vicinity Ahlgren (1966) also reported deer mice consumed quantities of jack pine seed. In Oregon, mice and shrews, mostly deer mice, destroyed 41% of the seeds of Douglas fir (Gashwiler 1970) . Hamilton (1941) , in New York, reported 180 deer mouse stomachs had the following food item frequencies: 73% insects, 44% starchy matter, most of which was seeds, and 21% green vegetation. In Colorado and Wyoming, the stomach content of 122 deer mice showed they fed mostly on the interiors and integuments of seeds, chiefly conifer mast (Williams 1959 ). Williams also found that 0.1% to 0.2% of the food consisted of insects and Arachnid remains; grubs and caterpillars were well represented in the diet. In California, Jameson (1955) reported deer mice fed largely upon the fruiting parts of various plants, mostly the mast. He concluded they are seed and berry eaters. Tevis (1956) , also in California, found that 208 deer mouse stomachs from a burned cutover contained 60% caterpillars by volume.",

Red-backed voles respond more slowly to vegetation changes after fire probably because of reduced cover and food (mostly succulent plant parts plus some seeds and insects). Smith and Aldous ( 1947) noted the food preferences of the vole runs more to succulent vegetation than to seeds in the vicinity of the study area. Fifty-nine stomachs of voles from a jack pine slash area showed that only 14% contained jack pine seeds; .the largest number per individual stomach was 25 and the average was 0.6.

This study was designed to determine changes in small mammal populations after fire in a mixed conifer-hardwood forest in northeastern Minnesota, and to relate such changes to post-fire plant communities. The dis- cussion of vegetation changes is limited to those general features that might have a direct effect upon rodent populations. Detailed post-fire vegetation response in these three areas has been published previously (Ahlgren 1960) . The study areas are located in Lake County, Minnesota, on the Superior National Forest and lie about 24 km southwest of Ely adjacent to State Highway 1. Each is topographically diverse, with rolling land containing numerous swamps, peat bogs, lakes, and outcrops of bedrock (Miller 194 7) . The Ahmeek soils are dark colored and are formed from a reddish brown noncalcareous sandy-stoney glacial till ( Arneman 1963) . Keweenawan basaltic flows, especially Duluth Gabro, predominate (Thiel 1947) . From 1950 to 1967, the average mean temperature was 2.4 oc and the average mean precipitation was 0.7 m (Ahlgren 1969) .",

The area trapped had been a 1 0-yr-old jack pine plantation before the fire. At the time of the fire, the ground was cold and moist; consequently, little or no soil burn occurred. Apparently, a strong southwesterly wind caused the fire to move quickly, leaving behind occasional small unburned areas. These patches may have acted as a refuge for some animals. Within a few days after the fire jack pine cones in surrounding, mature burned trees opened and dispersed seeds. In the fall following the fire, red pine (Pinus resinosa) trees were planted. When trapping was started, red pine and jack pine seedlings and sprouts of aspen and paper birch were frequent in the area. Common shrubs included mountain alder, beaked hazelnut, juneberry, rose (Rosa acicularis), pin cherry, bush honeysuckle, and blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium). In 1967 the burned area had a dense overstory of jack pine and red pine (Fig. 2) . One of the most important ground cover plants was sweet fern ( C omptonia peregrina) ; other less common shrubs were mountain alder, juneberry, bush honeysuckle, beaked hazelnut, and blueberry.",

These differences may be related to some of the major changes in populations of small mammals, especially red-backed voles and deer mice. Therefore, we must examine the vegetation on the two burns to determine whether it can be related to the abrupt shift of small mammals on the Heart Lake area and the more gradual shift on the Keeley Creek area. burned areas and their nearby control at intervals after fire. These species have been placed in six groups: Group 1 includes plants that are absent or rare on the control area and that came in abundantly soon after fire; Group 2, plants that increased on the burn but were also present on the control; Group 3, plants decreasing in frequency after fire; Group 4, plants that did not change in frequency after fire; Group 5, plants completely missing on burned land until the 5th or lOth yr, or later; Group 6, plants that were present before fire and reacted differently on different areas after fire. On both the Heart Lake and Keeley Creek areas total diversity did not change drastically, but there was an increase in the herb species that reproduce primarily by seed immediately after fire (Group 1). A vegetation-origin transect revealed that seeds of these species were present in the organic layer of the soil before burning; fire created conditions conducive to germination and also made seed readily available as a source of food. On the Heart Lake area, the major Group 1 species important to small mammals soon after burning were bindweed (Polygonum cilinode), sedges (Car ex adusta and C. Houghtonii), and pin cherry seeds exposed by fire. These species are temporary and were less frequent on the area or not producing seed by the lOth postfire year. Among the Group 2 plants, no seed-or berry-producing species increased in this area sufficiently to replace these temporary Group 1 plants as sources of food for deer mice. Hence, the supply of seed and berries for which deer mice show a preference decreased sharply in availability between the 5th and lOth yr.",

Such seedreproducing plants as geranium (Geranium Bick- nellii), fireweed (Epilobium glandulosum), bindweed, pink corydalis (Corydalis sempervirens), and swarthy sedge (Carex adusta) were also available, as well as pin cherry seed exposed in the burned humus. According to seed trap studies, jack pine seed was less available after the 2nd yr, and the frequency of such species as geranium and narrowleaved fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) and Group 2 berry and seed producers, raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and strawberry (Fragaria vesca), increased strikingly. Thus, in the Keeley Creek area, a continuous supply of seeds and berries was available. This difference in seed availability may partially explain the difference in the rate of decline of deer mice on the two areas. While plant species preferred as food by redbacked voles were available in both areas (succulent herbs as well as seeds-various species in Groups 1, 2, and 3), vegetation (cover density) differences other than the presence or absence of these food plant species may be more important in explaining the different abundances of this vole on the two areas.",

Possibly the \"carrying capacity\" of Keeley Creek was greater in the early years, at least partially because of greater habitat diversity. In later years, a growth of jack pine seedlings and other species provided cover on the Keeley Creek area; on Heart Lake, the natural jack pine and the planted red pine provided a somewhat similar cover.",
