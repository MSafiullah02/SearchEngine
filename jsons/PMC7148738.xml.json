Lymphopenia, as a consequence of lymphoid malignancy or treatment, is associated with reactivation of intracellular organisms such as mycobacteria, the herpes viruses, Toxoplasma gondii and Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly Pneumocystis carinii). Patients with chronic lymphoid malignancies and those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy, such as BMT recipients, have impaired antibody production which predisposes to infection with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. The use of indwelling central venous catheters and mucosal damage caused by chemotherapy and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection4 allows penetration by commensal flora. In recent years changes in cytotoxic chemotherapy have rendered the oropharynx a major portal of entry for \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci. Likewise, splenectomy undertaken as treatment or for diagnosis renders the patient susceptible to infection with encapsulated organisms such as Str. pneumoniae. Others have pre-existing sites of chronic infection such as middle-ear disease or bronchiectasis, which may act as reservoirs of infection with organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethnic origin and foreign travel may increase exposure to infections such as tuberculosis, malaria or strongyloidiasis.",

Infections with Gram-positive bacteria, especially the coagulase-negative staphylococci and \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci, have increased in frequency over the past two decades. In the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) participatory centers the incidence of bacteremia due to Gram-positive organisms increased from 29%5 to 67% during the 1970s and 1980s.6 This increase correlates with the escalating use of central venous catheters, the development of alternative high-dose chemotherapy with attendant mucositis, and better prevention of Gram-negative infections. However, subsequent trials have shown a fall again, possibly associated with the decline in quinolone prophylaxis usage associated with emerging resistance. Of recent interest is the finding that cell-wall deficient (mostly Gram-positive) bacteria may be responsible for up to 25% of episodes of neutropenic fever in BMT recipients.7\n",

Initially oral quinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin) were compared in a number of studies with placebo, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and non-absorbable antibiotics. In the majority of these the 4-quinolone treated patients had significantly fewer Gram-negative bacterial infections, a delayed onset of fever and a reduction in the number of days of fever. Importantly, a reduction in mortality was not demonstrated.29 There has been concern that quinolone resistance is increasing in some units30 and this has led to the discontinuation of quinolone prophylaxis. However, initial meta-analysis did not show this to be a significant problem, and recent EORTC and Health Protection Agency (HPA) data further support these findings. A sequential study has shown that combining ciprofloxacin with colistin was associated with no significant change in quinolone resistance over a 12-year period.31\n",

The second trial was in the outpatient setting and evaluated levofloxacin prophylaxis after chemotherapy for solid tumors and lymphomas for patients anticipated to have periods of neutropenia of 7 days or less. The effects of prophylaxis were similar between both patient groups in the two trials, as were mortality and tolerability. Both trials failed to demonstrate a significant survival benefit with prophylaxis.

It is difficult, therefore, to make recommendations for prophylaxis of Gram-positive pathogens other than to use levofloxacin which has been shown to be of benefit. Some centers advocate prophylaxis against pneumococcal infection in allogeneic HSCT recipients, functionally asplenic patients and in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD. Where pneumococcal isolates have intermediate to high-level resistance rates to penicillin approaching 35%, alternative agents should be considered based on local susceptibility patterns.

Traditionally the significant organisms have been the Enterobacteriaceae and Ps. aeruginosa, which carry a mortality of 40\u201360%.8,\n9 Earlier regimens included an aminoglycoside in combination with a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic in an attempt to achieve broad-spectrum and synergistic activity against organisms such as Ps. aeruginosa. Aminoglycoside use carries the inherent risk of renal and ototoxicity, and data for its combination with \u03b2-lactams in empirical therapy have been conflicting. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend aminoglycosides in patients at high risk of pseudomonal infections (history of previous pseudomonal infections or the presence of ecthyma gangrenosum) whereas Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines suggest they may be added in cases of progressive infection or documented resistant Gram-negative infection. A Cochrane review of 68 randomized controlled trials65 concluded that for the primary outcome measure of all-cause mortality, there was no significant difference between monotherapy and combination (RR = 0.85). For the second outcome measure of treatment failure there was an advantage to monotherapy in 37 trials comparing different \u03b2-lactams (this was for patients with documented infection or hematological malignancy) (RR = 0.86). There was no difference between the two comparator arms in the number of superinfections but significantly more adverse events in the combination group for nephrotoxicity. Another meta-analysis also concluded that monotherapy is as effective as aminoglycoside\u2013\u03b2-lactam combinations.66 Data from patients in non-neutropenic studies have shown that once-daily dosing aminoglycoside regimens are as efficacious as multiple-dose regimens.",

The predominant pathogens are coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staph. aureus.\n98 Others include Candida spp., coryneforms, Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas spp.99 Ideally, infected catheters should be removed, but coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections may be effectively suppressed or eliminated by administering antibiotics via the catheter until neutropenia has resolved.98 A high percentage of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated on hematology units are resistant to methicillin and other \u03b2-lactams. A glycopeptide (most frequently vancomycin) is given for these, with the chance of successful resolution of bacteremia and fever being more than 50%. Similar response rates can be obtained with coryneform infections but those due to Candida spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Staph. aureus, Ps. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Sten. maltophilia, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and any form of tunnel infection, require the catheter to be removed and appropriate antimicrobial therapy administered.100 The presence of port infection or septic phlebitis in association with long-term indwelling catheters are also indications for catheter removal and antimicrobial therapy.",

Mycophenolate mofetil, an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase which inhibits purine synthesis, has been used as a substitute for calcineurin inhibitors. Although it has no associated renal toxicity (and allows improvement in renal function), some studies have shown it to result in increased risk of rejection.124 A recent review comparing the use of azathioprine with mycophenolate in liver transplantation concluded that, to date, little if any clinical benefit could be observed of mycophenolate mofetil over azathioprine.129 There is still considerable scope for refining immunosuppression with these and other new agents, hopefully enabling a further reduction in infective complications.",
