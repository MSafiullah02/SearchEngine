COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic disease by WHO which has severely affected the livelihood of the population. SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the continents, as of April 11, 2020, has led to a total of 16,99,676 cases with a mortality of 1,02,734 among the registered cases. Presently, quarantine and symptomatic treatment protocol for disease management exists and there are no specific antiviral drugs available to combat this virus. As per Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India, in India there are 7447 Active cases and 239 deaths as on April 11, 2020; these data commensurate the impending risk facing the country. This pandemic is still ongoing, hence there is an urgent need to find new preventive and therapeutic agents as soon as possible [2].",

Siddha holistic approach will be helpful in combating COVID 19 using both therapeutic and non-therapeutic interventions. Siddhar\u2019s have advised evidence based treatment approach to understand a disease (Noi naadi), its etiology (Mudhal Naadi) based on those, fix a treatment (Athu Thanikka Vainaadi). As per basic Siddha Concept Siddhar Theran has defined Vatham is responsible for creation, Pittam for prevention and Aiyam for destruction. Infections happen to a person when his immunity is challenged which could be related with reduction of Pitham. According to Siddha theory, in a Covid19 infection there is initial increase of body temperature, cough and throat pain which may subside if there is good amount of immunity and these symptoms subside when Pitta thathu (Humor) come into action. If not, it escalates to a phase of Kapha Dosham (Disorder) which is said as \u201cThanamulla sethumanthan ilagil veppu\u201d. If not treated at this stage it slowly moves to a Stage of Sanni (Severe Pneumonia- Respiratory failure). It has been unanimously agreed to have equated diagnosis as Kaphasuram in Siddha in early stages moving towards Sanni and which is also reassured through Delphi or other sources of FGD (Focus group discussion).",

Drug discovery is a time consuming, slow and challenging process [11, 12], so it is necessary to depend on computational tools (computer-aided drug design) to overcome these pitfalls to an extent. Of late, the impact on these tools for new drug development had made the drug discovery process very cost effective and time efficient [11]. For searching compounds, this ligand-based virtual screening tool is used to identify most probable molecule with pharmacological activity using Molecular docking [13, 14,15]. Similarly, for studies pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and drug-likeness prediction many algorithms exist which makes the job easier [16]. There are lots of evidence which prove the application of computational tools in the discovery of natural-derived drugs [[17], [18], [19], [20]]. Hence, the aim of the current study is to apply this incredible in-silico screening methodology for the official Siddha formulation Kaba Sura Kudineer and the novel formulation JACOM against SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein.",
