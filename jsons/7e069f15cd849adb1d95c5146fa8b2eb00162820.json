In humans, coronavirus infections typically cause mild respiratory disease, including seasonal colds, yet some members of the family can be highly virulent. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, structurally related to the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), was identified in Wuhan, China. Its efficient transmission (R 0 of 2.2) facilitated its spread across the globe, with the first detected case in the USA reported on January 19, 2020. 1 On March 11, 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. 2 The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak is challenging every aspect of daily life, including the implementation of public health policy, the nature of social interactions, adaptation of the workforce to a 'new normal' and the medical research and clinical care infrastructure, including the care for oncology patients. Economic forecasts are concerning, and a global financial crisis is anticipated. Mathematical modeling based on available data shows that in the face of rapid geographical spread and a high case-fatality ratio, even the most advanced healthcare systems are very likely to be overwhelmed in the coming weeks and months. 3 It will be critical to identify therapies with low barriers to rapid clinical deployment.",

            "text": "It is becoming apparent that in some patients, severe COVID-19 disease occurs, and is accompanied by a fulminant and damaging immune reaction, sometimes called the 'cytokine storm', characterized by pronounced infiltration of macrophages and monocytes into the alveolae, a pro-inflammatory T-helper 17 (Th17) response, and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1). [4] [5] [6] [7] This pro-inflammatory cytokine profile has been with poor prognosis and severe lung pathology characterized by interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation and pulmonary edema. [8] [9] [10] As the oncology community rallies behind our colleagues in intensive care, internal medicine, emergency medicine and Open access infectious disease, the immunotherapy field is poised to offer insights into the application of immune-modulatory therapies. Modulation of IL-6, in particular, which has emerged as a potentially promising option for COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is used for the treatment of some rheumatological disorders, 11 and has become a mainstay in recent years in the management of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for hematological malignancies. [12] [13] [14] Although the cytokine levels observed in patients with COVID-19 experiencing ARDS are much lower than those seen in CRS after delivery of CAR Tcell therapies and CD3-based bispecific Tcell engagers, the cancer immunotherapy community's experience in using the IL-6 receptor antagonists to modulate severe inflammatory pathology in the setting of CRS may prove to be useful in identifying therapies that could be of use in this setting.",

The aim of this analysis is to describe available strategies that could alleviate the burden on the healthcare system with a specific emphasis on therapeutics that could block or modulate the systemic inflammatory response and pulmonary complications caused by COVID-19, in particular, IL-6, IL-1 and TNF\u03b1 pathways. 15 ratIonale for targetIng Il-6 SARS-CoV-2 causes the emergent respiratory disease called COVID-19. One of the challenging aspects in management of the infection is that different presentations have been identified 16 : \u25ba Asymptomatic carrier state \u25ba Mild respiratory symptoms, not requiring hospitalization \u25ba Recovered and re-examined positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after discharge \u25ba Acute respiratory disease: respiratory presentation (fever, cough, dyspnea), without radiological evidence of a parenchymal process. Additional symptoms may include myalgias, headache, sore throat, anosmia, chills, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. \u25ba Severe respiratory disease: pneumonia, often bilateral, which can progress in severity ultimately requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care management. While ARDS is the common feature in patients with severe disease, other manifestations have been described, such as acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy and shock. 17 \u25ba Lethal infection: the case-fatality rate has been reported from 0.1% to 2%, although complete epidemiological analysis is ongoing worldwide and facing the challenge of testing availability. Death is typically due to massive alveolar damage and irreversible respiratory failure. 18 Almost 75% of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory disease present with abnormal findings on chest CT scans. Ground-glass opacities are the most common finding, reported in as many as 60% of patients. Other findings include patchy infiltrates, and interstitial lung disease, although some patients present with minimal imaging abnormalities. 5 7 17 19 Pathological findings resemble those seen in SARS and MERS: edema, proteinaceous exudates, focal reactive pneumocyte type II hyperplasia, patchy cellular inflammation and multinucleated giant cells. 9 Notably, neutrophil infiltration is not significant. 20 Elevated C reactive protein (CRP) and elevated aspartate transaminase are common in patients with COVID-19 and reports from Hubei province in China indicate that severe cases are associated with elevated levels of inflammatory markers including serum d-dimer, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase. 21 The cytokine profile of severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by elevated IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, IL-17, TNF\u03b1 and other markers that indicate systemic inflammatory response, 22 similar to what has been described in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). 23 24 Moreover, a retrospective multicenter study of 150 patients performed from Wuhan, China suggested that among other clinical parameters, CRP and IL-6 levels can be predictors of mortality. Among 68 patients who died, median IL-6 level was 11.4 ng/mL as opposed to 6.8 ng/ mL in those 82 who survived (p<0.001). 25 Additionally, an elevated neutrophil-to-leukocyte ratio was also predictive of poor prognosis.",

In these contexts, IL-6 levels peak at the time of maximal T cell proliferation and patients may develop a CRS that can be quite severe and even Open access life-threatening. 14 Administration of IL-6 blocking agents such as tocilizumab and siltuximab has been shown to be effective in reversing CRS in these patients. [28] [29] [30] Tocilizumab was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CRS secondary to CAR T cell therapy in 2017, 13 and incorporated into the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for the approved CAR T cell therapy products, tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel.",

China's National Health Commission has recently issued updated treatment guidelines that include the use of tocilizumab in patients with severe disease. 34 The FDA is closely monitoring the medical product supply chain, 35 and the demand for drugs used to treat patients with COVID-19 including but not limited to tocilizumab, could surpass the ability to manufacture these agents. Additionally, in some cases, access to tocilizumab and sarilumab is limited despite adequate supply. For example, the study protocol for sarilumab in COVID-19-related ARDS initially excluded individuals who have recently been treated with any other investigational drugs, high-dose steroids or cyclophosphamide chemotherapyeffectively preventing numerous patients with cancer and patients receiving immunotherapy from receiving this potentially lifesaving intervention-however, amended exclusion criteria may relax these requirements. Ongoing and future clinical trials should consider the unique characteristics of oncology patients in their design (including inclusion and exclusion criteria), in light of the fact that the large, immune-suppressed population of patients with cancer may be particularly susceptible to severe complications of COVID-19. 36 In addition, although data are not available, it is unknown whether pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 may be potentiated or attenuated in oncology patients being treated with immunotherapeutic approaches that themselves can have significant pulmonary toxicity, including checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T cells.",

In the airway, alveolar macrophages produce IL-6, and expression may be Open access induced in epithelial cells by IFN\u03b3 and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). 37 38 The effects of IL-6 are context-specific and may be both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Although IL-6 is essential for both innate and adaptive immunity-patients with autoantibodies to the cytokine or germline mutations in its downstream signaling effectors are susceptible to recurrent infections and often die prematurely due to pneumonia. In turn, uncontrolled IL-6 expression leads to profound inflammatory damage to host cells. 11 39 Under homeostatic conditions, serum concentrations of IL-6 are typically lower than picograms per mL, but under conditions of severe inflammation, levels may reach up to nanograms per mL, as seen in severe CRS 31 or even micrograms per mL in fatal sepsis. 40 regulation of Il-6 expression Expression of IL-6 is regulated at multiple levels including chromatin accessibility, transcription, mRNA export, post-transcription and translation. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 also induce IL-6 expression. 41 Coronavirus' spike proteins have also been shown to directly promote IL-6 production in immune and epithelial cells. Cultured SARS-CoVinfected bronchial epithelial cells secrete IL-6, 42 and murine macrophages upregulate IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 through a nuclear factor-\u03baB-dependent pathway in response to viral S protein. 43 Il-6 signaling (classical and trans) Signaling through the IL-6 receptor requires assembly at the cell membrane of a complex consisting of IL-6 bound to both the 80 kDa type 1 cytokine a-receptor subunit (IL-6R, also called CD126) and a 130 kDa signal-transducing b-receptor glycoprotein (gp130; also called CD130). This trimeric complex homodimerizes, leading to receptor activation. 11 44 Expression of the membrane-bound form of IL-6R is largely restricted to hepatocytes, megakaryocytes and leukocytes, 45 yet two independent pathways generate a soluble form of the receptor: cleavage by membrane metalloproteinases, primarily ADAM10 and ADAM17, as well as alternative splicing. [45] [46] [47] Soluble IL-6/IL-6R receptor complex can also bind gp130, activating the downstream signaling cascade. The ubiquitous expression of gp130, which has been detected in all human tissues examined, underlies the pleiotropic effects of IL-6, and the near universal responsiveness to the cytokine across cell types. Receptor activation through the membrane-bound IL-6R versus the soluble form of IL-6R are referred to as classical and trans signaling, respectively. Generally, classical signaling contributes to regenerative and anti-inflammatory responses, whereas trans signaling is pro-inflammatory and plays a role in causing tissue damage.",

Antibodies such as tocilizumab, sarilumab and siltuximab inhibit IL-6 signaling by antagonizing ligand-receptor engagement, whereas Jakinibs prevent the downstream signaling cascade. The intracellular domain of gp130 is constitutively associated with the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2. On homodimerization, JAKs autophosphorylate and JAK1 phosphorylates 5 tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of gp130, leading to the activation of multiple intracellular signaling cascades. Recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT3 initiates its homodimerization and nuclear trafficking, initiating a transcriptional program associated with proliferation, differentiation, recruitment, survival and transformation in T and B cells and myeloid cells. A negative feedback loop modulates activation of the IL-6-JAK/STAT cascade, as STAT3 upregulates SOCS1 and SOCS3, which directly inhibits the catalytic activity of JAK by binding to phosphorylated gp130 at tyrosine 759, and stops JAK activation through direct binding. 11 Phosphorylated gp130 is also a binding site for SH2 domain tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), activating a cascade involving RAS, RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), which culminates in the activation of various transcription factors involved in increasing cell growth, antibody synthesis and acute phase protein generation. JAK also phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is then phosphorylated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to become phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which then phosphorylates PkB/Akt serine/threonine kinase to modulate expression of several genes involved in cellular survival. 12 is indicated for the treatment of patients with Castleman's disease. Of note, it was not studied in patients with HIV or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infections as preclinical studies showed lack of binding to virally produced IL-6.

            "text": "Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription (JaK/stat) inhibitors While encouraging preliminary results have been observed with IL-6 blockade, potential constraints on the supply of IL-6/IL-6R-targeting antibodies may limit access to these drugs and the numbers of patients that can benefit. In order to expand the spectrum of patients who may access IL-6-modulatory therapies, alternative targets within the cytokine's inflammatory signaling cascade could be considered. IL-6 signaling takes place via two mechanisms: binding to a higher affinity membrane-bound receptor (classical) or soluble IL-6 receptor (trans). 41 44 Both lead to activation of JAK/STAT signaling downstream through JAK1 and STAT3, on tyrosine phosphorylation on the gp130 receptor's cytoplasmic tail. JAK/STAT signaling is also activated by other pro-inflammatory cytokines that are observed to be elevated in COVID-19, particularly IFN\u03b3 (although IFN signaling is primarily via STAT1). STATs also play important roles in non-canonical cell signaling pathways, including activity of non-tyrosine phosphorylated STATs, mediation of DNA methylation, regulation of cell adhesion and mitochondrial activity. 48 Small molecules targeting this pathway have been successfully introduced into the clinic, and are a therapeutic option in a number of inflammatory processes, 49 including graft versus host disease and HLH. 50 51 In xenograft models, ruxolitinib was able to prevent CRS after CAR Tcell therapy. 52 Importantly, a phase III trial is being initiated to assess ruxolitinib in combination with standard of care compared with standard of care alone in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 53 Additionally, a phase II single-arm study of fedratinib is planned. The rationale for developing these agents as an option to prevent or treat cytokine release in COVID-19 is compelling, especially given the relative ease of manufacturing small molecules at scale as compared with biologics. The safety profiles of JAK inhibitors are generally manageable and predictable including increased risk of viral infections, lower GI complications and anemia and leukopenia. 54 55 Because IL-6 signaling primarily occurs through JAK1, the selectivity of JAK inhibitors should be considered before their use for COVID-19. Additionally, 'Jakinibs' are oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 54 which may not be easily administered/absorbed in patients with very severe ongoing systemic inflammatory response. \u25ba Ruxolitinib (Jakavi/Jakafi \u00ae , Incyte) is an oral JAK inhibitor with selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2 indicated for treatment of intermedia-risk or high-risk myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera unresponsive or intolerant to hydroxyurea and steroid-refractory graft versus host disease in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. \u25ba Tofacitinib (Xeljanz \u00ae , Jakvinus, Pfizer) is an oral JAK inhibitor with selectivity for JAK1 and JAK3 indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

As with any cytokine modulator, IL-1 blockade carries increased risk of bacterial infections, but after many years of clinical experience and tens of thousands of patients treated, it has become apparent that opportunistic infections are highly rare with anakinra treatment, even among people at high risk for tuberculosis reactivation. Of note, anti-IL-1 therapy is associated with a reduction in circulating neutrophil counts, 58 which may be clinically significant given that a high NLR (Neutrophil to Leukocyte Ratio) is predictive of poor prognosis in COVID-19. Evidence for improved outcomes after using IL-1 modulating therapies for CRS is lacking and variable. The timing of IL-R1 antagonist administration may be critical, and limited benefit may be obtained with treatment of already-established ARDS. Targeting IL-1\u03b2 directly, either by reducing its effective concentration via a receptor trap or monoclonal antibody may also be impactful. tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors Ligands and receptors of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily play central roles in regulation of the immune system and tissue homeostasis. Although TNF signaling is vital for antipathogen immune responses and is protective in a variety of viral infections including smallpox, 73 West Nile virus 74 and influenza, 75 elevated levels of TNF\u03b1 have been linked to pulmonary pathology in acute lung injury. Elevated TNF\u03b1 is observed in both plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with ARDS, and expression of the cytokine directly leads to increased endothelial permeability along with impaired alveolar fluid clearance due to downregulation of epithelial sodium channels. 76 77 Elevated serum TNF\u03b1 has been reported to correlate with severe disease in COVID-19, 8 and the SARS-CoV S protein has been demonstrated to induce TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 upregulation in murine macrophages. 43 The primary sources of TNF\u03b1 are stimulated monocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, although macrophages, T cells, B lymphocytes, granulocytes, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and mast cells all produce TNF\u03b1 as well. [77] [78] [79] TNF\u03b1 is synthesized as a membrane-protein and cleaved by ADAM17 to release its soluble form. Both the soluble and membranebound forms of TNF\u03b1 are active, although their affinities to TNF-family receptors varies. TNF\u03b1 signaling is complex, and may involve as many as 29 different tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family members.

The IFN family of proteins encompasses three distinct classes, with variable direct antiviral and immunemodulatory activities. 87 The IFN\u03b3 receptor is expressed on both malignant and non-malignant cell populations. 88 On receptor binding, IFN\u03b3 initiates a signaling cascade through JAK1 and JAK2 activation, which leads to STAT1 homodimerization and nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of a wide array of IFN-inducible genes through the GAS enhancer element. 88 89 IFN\u03b3 has been implicated as an important downstream effector cytokine in the antitumor immune response, and in the immune response to various infectious pathogens, including viruses. 90 Although protective in the context of antiviral host defense, IFN\u03b3 also has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 'cytokine storm' and in various autoimmune diseases. 91 92 Anti-IFN therapy has been investigated in HLH, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis. 91 93 Elevated serum IFN\u03b3 has been associated with severe acute respiratory distress in COVID-19. 8 21 36 94 Additionally, IFN\u03b3 enhances IL-6 production in monocytes 95 and an IFN\u03b3-related cytokine storm syndrome was reported in some patients during the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak. 96 Anti-IFN antibodies have been demonstrated to alleviate acute lung injury induced by severe H1N1 influenza infection in murine models, 97 and a trial of the human monoclonal anti-IFN\u03b3 emapalumab in combination with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra for COVID-19 is ongoing. 98 Anti-interferon therapy is approved in the US for the treatment of primary HLH.

Modulation/inhibition of the severe inflammatory state in patients with COVID-19, characterized by elaboration of various inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, is a potentially important strategy to treat and/or limit severe COVID-19 pulmonary complications, including ARDS. If successful across the broader population of patients with COVID-19, strategies such as anti-IL-6-directed therapy could reduce the needs for ICU support and mechanical ventilation, and ultimately decrease mortality.",

As described here, other anti-IL-6 agents, including small molecule inhibitors of IL-6 signaling, and other anticytokine inhibitors may warrant investigation, particularly in the setting of overwhelming demand for agents to modulate the inflammatory state in patients with Ongoing studies are also investigating other strategies, such as the use of eculizumab (a monoclonal antibody that targets complement protein C5, approved for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria), or some TLR7-8 inhibitors such as M5049. In all likelihood, a combinatorial approach encompassing antivirals such as remdesivir and potentially cytokine-modulatory therapies may be needed to successfully treat the infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the full spectrum of associated complications.",

While this is encouraging news and the appropriate way to proceed from a drug development perspective, the healthcare community and, more importantly, the affected patients, need effective treatments without delay, especially as the numbers of cases in the USA and several countries around the world continue to grow exponentially. Consideration also should be given to focus efforts on rapidly expanding the ability of clinicians and clinical investigators to access investigational anti-IL-6 agents, in particular for those agents where phase II and/or phase II studies have been completed, and acceptable safety has been demonstrated. Use of cytokine-modulatory agents during these extreme circumstances may additionally warrant consideration, and definitive prospective randomized trials also should be conducted with all due haste.
