Probes in microarray are one kind of the most important materials. Usually, scientists use a unique probe for marking a special target sequence. Thus, for identifying n different viruses, we need n different probes. Recently, some researchers study non-unique probes to identify viruses by using less number of probes. In this case, a virus can be identified by a combination of some probes. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a set of probes that can identify all the given targets. We consider the k-fault tolerance selection of probes. That is, if any k probes fail, then we still can identify each target. We propose a practical algorithm for this k-fault tolerance probe selection problem. Some experiments are studied on SARS, H5N1, and so on.",

In this case, for n different targets, we need n different probes to identify these targets. If we allow one probe fault, then for the premise of unique sequences, each target will need two unique sequences as probes. It is not hard to see that the number of probes will be doubled. It is very impractical. Thus, some researchers focus on non-unique probes [9, 10] . Since each of non-unique probes can hybridize with more than one target, fewer probes are needed. In this case, a target is identified by a combination of selected probes.

Each of them is between 25 and 80 bp. To obtain probes, we need to consider the temperature, GC contents rate, DNA secondary structure, and cross-hybridization. Most known probes are stored in NCBI GeneBank. There are several softwares can help us to find probes, such as MAPS [2] , GoArray [11] , OligoArray [12] , and so on. Figure 1 shows an example. For unique probes, each target needs one unique probe to identify itself. In the non-unique probes, we use less probes to identify all the targets. Table 1 shows a relation table according to Figure 1 . In this table, if target T i can hybridize to probe P j , then the (i, j) entry is 1. According to this table, it is clear that we need four probes to identify all the targets by using unique probes. But for nun-unique probes, two probes, namely, P 1 and P 3 , are sufficient. That is an advantage of using non-unique probes. Furthermore, in large transcript families, such as alternative splice variants of a gene, or in a large family of closely homologous genes, it is often impossible to find a unique probe of 25 bp as a signature for a specific variant [10] . So we consider about non-unique probes.",

In the case that different probes have the same distinguishable ability, we only keep one. In Table 4 , T 1 can hybridize to probe P 1 , but T 2 cannot. That is, P 1 can distinguish T 1 and T 2 .

In this graph, each edge denotes that the probe can differentiate the two targets in the target pair. By using non-unique probes, each target pair has more than two incident edges. That is, if we remove any one node from the probe set, any node in the target pairs still has at least one incident edge. It means that each target pair still can be distinguished by one probe. Based on this fact, it is not hard to see that a probe set is k-fault tolerance if every target pair in the graph has at least k + 1 edges. Figure 3 shows an example of 1-fault tolerance. In this graph, every target pair has at least two edges and any failure probe will not affect the distinguishable ability. Output variables coverArray It is an array of size n. Each entry stores the number of target pairs that can be distinguished by the corresponding probe. ftArray It is an array of size m. Initially, every entry is 0. If every entry is at least k + 1, then the found probe set is k-fault tolerance. identifyArray It is an array of size m. Each entry stores the number of probes that can be used to identify the target pair. P robeSet A probe set outputted by our algorithm.",
