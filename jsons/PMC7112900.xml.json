To date, many mutations including point mutations and few short deletions or insertions were detected in different infected individuals (Chen et al., 2003, He et al., 2004). Considerable researches suggested that variations in viral genomes caused viral transmission from animal to man (Tsui et al., 2003, Ruan et al., 2003, Guan et al., 2003). The genotypes at six positions (nt9404, nt9479, nt19838, nt21721, nt22222 and nt27827) with high-mutation rate were identified closely with the three phases of the SARS epidemic (Table 1\n) \u2013 C, C, A, A, C, C (early phase); C, T/C, G, A, C, C (middle phase); T, T, A, G, T, T (late phase). Because the mutations were closely identified with SARS-CoV emergence, the study of the mutations can provide helpful informations for other studies, such as the SARS vaccine, the SARS drug design and the infectious mechanisms of the SARS-CoV.",

Only 1 fmol of the purified PCR products can be detected by this method (Bellis. et al., 2002). A microarray system with the similar method for the SARS-CoV detection and genotyping is reported here (Fig. 1\n). In contrast with RT-PCR and the cDNA microarray used to detect SARS-CoV, this universal microarray cannot only detect the SARS-CoV but also identify the genotypes of six mutated bases related to the different phases of the SARS epidemic. This microarray system is more economical and labor-saving than the SARS-CoV resequencing microarray for complete sequence analysis. Actually, the partial sequences around important variations can provide enough information for viral detection as well as for genotyping.",

SARS-CoV TOR2 genome sequence was used as a reference in the analysis. It was found that the mutated bases at six positions (nt9404, nt9479, nt19838, nt21721, nt22222 and nt27827) are related to the SARS epidemic. These mutated bases have high-mutation rates and one base (nt19838) is non-sense mutation as well as a contrastive detection site. The two sites, nt9404 and nt9479, lie in the coded sequences of Nsp1, a protein with the most number of amino acid changes (Table 2\n). Two bases (nt21721 and nt22222) were found in the coding sequences of Spike and a base (nt27827) in the coding sequence of SARS8a may play an important role in the evolution of SARS-CoV (He et al., 2004). Considering the character of the LDR reaction, about 28 bases were chosen at 3\u2032 end of the discriminating oligonucleotide and about 22 bases at 5\u2032 end of the labeled oligonucleotide as the hybridization zone (Table 3\n). The hybridization zones were checked and ensured that they were found only in SARS-CoV genome sequences.",

If not the detection base, the \u201cmutant\u201d becomes noneffective after LDR reaction. At the time, the amount of the SARS-CoV templates was far more than the amount of the templates with the \u201cmutant\u201d, which was the main reason to eliminate the influence of the PCR \u201cmutant\u201d.
