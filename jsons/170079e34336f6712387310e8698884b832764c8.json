Educators across the world have begun to use technology-based applications or \"justin-time\" instructional strategies to an extent never seen before. Such instructional strategies are intended to implement the curriculum in the absence of a physical classroom. However, they do not emphasize the design of instructional material used in it or the mastery of information by learner per se (1) . The ultimate goal of medical education is to cause changes in behaviour through gaining information. It is vital to understand how the student's memory handles the information load imposed by online instruction format and extent of information retention.",

When a teacher delivers the lecture via streaming applications such as Zoom Cloud Meeting\u00ae or Google classroom, it is impossible to ascertain the level of attention by the student. The allotment of working memory may not be limited to grasping the information conveyed by the teacher, but also to other events happening concurrently in the surrounding environment. The information from a streaming lecture can be channelled into three sub-systems: a) visuo-spatial path, for visual images which are either projected or drawn on the screen, b) phonological path, for listening to the verbal information (delivered by the presenter), and c) a buffer system, to integrate both sub-paths into working memory (3) . When the attention of the students gets bifurcated, the integration of sub-paths does not happen. Further, the frequency with which chunks of new information are presented also determines the efficacy of information consolidation. Rapid delivery of new information leads to clogging of working memory.",

There is a need to differentiate the instructional elements which have low interactivity compared to those with higher interactivity. For example, a lecture on anatomical components of basal nuclei has few highly interactive elements. Missing one element will not compromise on the comprehension of the other elements. However, a lecture on physiological communications and functional aspects of basal nuclei has many high interactivity elements that cannot be omitted. If the teacher omits certain interacting elements in order to make the lecture appear easy, then, it may compromise the understanding and impair learning by students. On the contrary,",

Too much but less effective: Managing the cognitive load teaching too many essential elements at a stretch would overwhelm the cognitive capacity of the students. One method to overcome this conundrum is to create an effective cognitive schema, where multiple elements are seamlessly integrated. Also, allotting adequate time gap between different elements will enable mental rehearsal. Another method to deal with too many interacting elements in a lecture is to divide the lecture topic into 2-3 smaller segments and test the learning activity by asking the students to draw concept maps or solve multiple-choice questions. Thus, we need to understand that the primary challenge in creating content for online lectures is to manage the intrinsic load of the instructional formats.",

Even if we consider the content, delivery and material as constant factors, the learning taking place in the conventional classroom-based physical environment would not be similar to a distance and individual learning environment. The classroom environment, with the presence of teacher and peers, is found to have a positive effect on the learner's willingness to participate in active discussions and motivation (9) . Dowaliby and Schumer (10) measured the level of the students' anxiety in learner-centred and teacher-centred environments. They found that students with higher levels of anxiety performed better in the conventional teachercentred environment compared to those with lower anxiety who performed better in a learnercentred environment. If we extrapolate this finding to virtual and distance learning, we could see that students with lower levels of anxiety could learn better.",

By sensing the processing ability of the learner, by reducing the extraneous load and tailoring the element interactivity, the inputs could be integrated into an effective mental schema and then into long term memory.
