These blood islands coalesce to form a pair of endothelial heart tubes, which on day 21 fuse into a single primitive heart tube with a cranial inflow (arterial) and a caudal outflow (venous) end. This primitive heart tube is divided into 5 regions: truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and sinus venosus. Initial contractions occur on day 21\u201322, and unidirectional circulation is established by week 4. From weeks 4\u20137, folding and septation of the heart and the great vessels takes place, critical to the development of the 4 chambers and the normal embryonic vascular circuit. In the developed heart, the atrial chambers lie cephalad and to the right of their corresponding ventricles, and the right-sided chambers lie anterior to their corresponding left-sided chambers. The atrial and ventricular septation is summarized later.",

Its main component is the central fibrous body, where the leaflets of all 4 cardiac valves converge.

It is located at the left ventricular outlet, separating the aorta and the ventricle. Owing to its central location, it is the only valve in the heart that is related to all 4 chambers and each of the valves. As a trileaflet semilunar valve, it consists of 3 cusps: the left and right coronary cusps giving rise to their respective coronary arteries, as well as the non-coronary cusp, which faces the interatrial septum. The right coronary cusp is the most anterior and is adjacent to the right ventricular outflow tract. The left coronary cusp is located posteriorly relative to the other 2. Histologically, its cusps are composed of dense collagenous plates, which are in continuity with the fibrous skeleton of the heart, covered by endocardium. Each cusp has its attachment to the aorta and the left ventricle. Immediately behind the cusps, the wall of the proximal ascending aorta bulges outward to form the aortic sinuses of Valsalva. The function of these sinuses is to prevent coronary ostial occlusion by creating eddy currents of blood flow during rapid ejection. As with the pulmonic valve, each cusp has a fibrous nodule at the midpoint of their free edges, forming the nodule of Arantius. The leaflets coapt via their crescent-shaped surfaces. Incomplete coaptation of the valve leaflets during diastole results in aortic regurgitation, whereas limited systolic leaflet excursion due to excessive leaflet thickening resulting from degenerative or rheumatic disease process suggests the presence of aortic stenosis. The severity of aortic stenosis can be assessed by various methods. A peak transaortic velocity of greater than 4 m/second, a peak transaortic gradient of at least 70 mm Hg and a mean gradient of at least 40\u201350 mm Hg, as well as an aortic valve area of less than 1 cm2 is consistent with severe aortic stenosis.",

Circus movement re-entry due to an anatomical or functional block is a major mechanism and the most commonly described. For a re-entrant circuit to occur, 2 roughly parallel conductive pathways must be connected with conductive tissue, capable of forming an electrical circuit. One of these pathways must have a refractory period substantially longer than that of the other pathway (pathway A). Finally, the pathway with the shorter refractory period (alternate pathway, pathway B) must conduct impulses more slowly than pathway A. Once an extra impulse (for example, premature contraction) encounters these 2 separate pathways of conduction when pathway A is unable to be depolarized due to being in the refractory period but pathway B is capable of depolarization, the impulse will be conducted via pathway B. The signal then travels to the distal end of pathway A to reconnect with it if it is no longer refractory, then it is conducted retrograde to the site where it reconnects with pathway B. Pathway B has a shorter refractory period and therefore it recovers faster: The impulse will travel into pathway B where it will reenter that portion of the circuit, completing the loop.

Stimulation by their agonists activates adenylate cyclase to produce cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP in turn activates protein kinases pathways with subsequent phosphorylation of L-type calcium channels and troponin C, the net effect being enhanced inotropy, positive chronotropy and dromotropy. These responses are all blunted by receptor occupancy by beta antagonists.\nPropranolol \u2013 Propranolol is a non-selective \u03b2(beta)-1 and \u03b2(beta)-2 receptor blocker with no alpha-receptor activity. As the most soluble beta blocker, its use is associated with the highest frequency of central nervous system side effects. It is well absorbed when taken by mouth. For a comparable effect, higher oral than intravenous doses are required due to its very high (90%) hepatic first-pass metabolism. Its active metabolite does not add to the primary clinical effect due to its short half-life. Propranolol decreases cardiac output by decreasing the heart rate and reducing myocardial contractility, effects that are especially prominent in sympathetically driven disease states. Owing to its \u03b2(beta)-2 receptor antagonism, propranolol may increase systemic vascular and coronary vascular resistance. Increased airway resistance may be evoked by propranolol in asthmatic patients. Renal and hepatic blood flow is reduced with the administration of propranolol.\nMetoprolol \u2013 Metoprolol was the first \u03b2(beta)-1 selective receptor antagonist used in clinical practice to prevent increased chronotropy and inotropy in response to sympathetic stimulation. Its receptor selectivity is dose related. Metoprolol is lipid-soluble, it diffuses more readily into ischemic regions than hydrophilic drugs. Fifty percent of the drug administered is metabolized during first-pass hepatic metabolism. At the intravenous dose of 0.2 mg/kg, maximum beta receptor blockade is achieved.\nEsmolol \u2013 Esmolol is a short-acting cardioselective agent metabolized rapidly by red blood cell esterases. It is primarily a \u03b2-1 blocking agent, producing significant decreases in heart rate and contractility. It lacks the ability to block peripheral vascular \u03b2-2 receptors, therefore decreases in blood pressure and cardiac index is more pronounced due to unopposed peripheral vasodilation. Esmolol has been safely used in patients with reactive airway disease.\nSotalol \u2013 Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic agent with both \u03b2-receptor and K+-channel antagonistic effects. A relatively recent Cochrane database review found significant reductions in incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in the cardiac surgical population. Despite the conclusions of this review, the use of sotalol in the post-cardiac surgical population remains limited, owing to sotalol\u2019s undesired side effects, such as hypotension, bradycardia, QT-prolongation, and inducing torsade-type ventricular arrhythmias.\n",

Contraindications include: narrow angle glaucoma, labor, thyrotoxicosis. Epinephrine should be used with caution in patients with the following conditions: severe coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, irritable myocardium, diabetes, cerebrovascular insufficiency, thyroid disease, pregnancy. Rapid administration, for example, in cardiac arrest, may cause devastating cerebrovascular hemorrhage.

It has effects on alpha, beta, and dopaminergic (DA) receptors. At the lowest doses (1\u20133 mcg/kg/min) its dopaminergic effects are dominant, resulting in the dilation of the cerebrovascular, renal, and mesenteric vascular beds. In low to moderate dose ranges its \u03b21-adrenergic effects are predominant, resulting in increased heart rate, increased contractility, and increased cardiac output. At high doses (greater than 10\u201320 mcg/kg/min) its \u03b11-agonist effects predominate: high-dose dopamine increases SVR, PVR, and decreases peripheral perfusion. It is an effective mixed inotrope and vasoconstrictor; however, it is not recommended as first-line therapy in the treatment of septic shock due to the side effects associated with its use. Dopamine has positive chronotropic effects in all dose ranges, and in higher dose ranges it may induce arrhythmias due to increased excitability and conduction. It does not have significant \u03b22 effects. Dopamine causes less increase in O2 consumption than isoproterenol.\nHemodynamic effects: Direct agonist on \u03b11, \u03b21, \u03b22, and DA-receptors. Indirectly, it increases norepinephrine levels by its conversion into norepinephrine and by inducing norepinephrine release from storage sites.

Dopamine usually widens pulse pressure by increasing systolic, and to a much less extent, the diastolic pressure. At low doses, dopamine produces renal and mesenteric vasodilation. At high infusion rates, renal perfusion is decreased.Heart rate: increased,Cardiac output: augmented,\n\nCommon clinical use: treatment of hypotension due to low SVR or cardiac output. May be the first choice for temporizing hypotension until intravascular volume is restored.

Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may potentiate and prolong the effects of dopamine. Extravasation may result in skin necrosis.

It is a racemic mixture of enantiomers of (\u2212) dobutamine with vasoconstrictor (\u03b11-agonist), and (+) dopamine with vasodilator (\u03b11-antagonist) properties. It is a myocardial \u03b21-agonist with a predominant positive inotropic effect. Its \u03b22 and \u03b11 effects are limited, and it completely lacks \u03b12 effects. In the heart, it augments myocardial contractility and O2 consumption, and increases cardiac output by increasing heart rate and stroke volume. Increased myocardial work is compensated by increased coronary blood flow. On all systemic vascular beds and pulmonary blood vessels it acts as a vasodilator and may cause hypotension. This is primarily mediated by its mild \u03b22 effects, which are partially unopposed by dobutamine\u2019s \u03b11 effects.\nHemodynamic effects:\nPreload: Dobutamine decreases venous resistance and mean systemic filling pressure. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure is decreased.Contractility: augmented.Lusitropy: dobutamine increases early peak diastolic filling rate in normal-weight patients, and this increase is linearly related to the increased heart rate. In obese patients, the correlation between heart rate and diastolic filling rate is lost as the rate of relaxation is significantly lower, suggesting that baseline relaxation reserve is impaired in obesity, and this impaired diastolic function is not resolved during stress.Afterload: decreased SVR and PVR. SVR may increase in the presence of \u03b2-adrenergic blockade.Heart rate: increased.Cardiac output: augmented.\n\nCommon clinical use: short-term inotropic support in low cardiac output states, especially in right ventricular failure, afterload reduction in left and/or right systolic heart failure (pulmonary congestion, cardiogenic shock; drug of choice in right heart failure), stress echocardiography. May be combined with dopamine to augment preload, contractility and systemic vascular resistance.\nAdministration: IV or IO, central venous administration is preferred via controlled infusion device.

Heart rate and contractility drastically increases due to both the baroreceptor reflex and phentolamine\u2019s direct effect on central presynaptic \u03b12 receptors, allowing for increased norepinephrine release and decreased reuptake. This results in unopposed \u03b2 effects that may provoke arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia, and respond well to \u03b2-blockers. In patients pre-treated with phentolamine, administration of epinephrine may result in hypotension due to unopposed \u03b22 effects.

It is used for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma (a drop in SBP >35 mm Hg and DBP >25 mm Hg is diagnostic for pheochromocytoma), management of hypertensive episodes associated with the resection of pheochromocytoma, as well as local treatment of skin necrosis associated with norepinephrine extravasation.\nPhenoxybenzamine \u2013 Phenoxybenzamine is a nonselective, noncompetitive adrenergic \u03b11- and \u03b12-antagonist at postganglionic synapses in smooth muscle and exocrine glands. Its main action is arterial vasodilation with minimal venodilation. It decreases SVR and PVR. Heart rate and contractility are increased due to both the baroreceptor reflex and phentolamine\u2019s direct effect on central presynaptic \u03b12 receptors, allowing for increased norepinephrine release and decreased reuptake. This results in unopposed \u03b2 effects that may provoke arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia, and respond well to \u03b2-blockers. Phenoxybenzamine is available in PO form only. It is used for treatment of pheochromocytoma; it is started 10\u201314 days preoperatively to allow for expansion of blood volume. To avoid unopposed alpha-stimulation and life-threatening hypertensive episodes, \u03b2-blockers are not introduced until after adequate alpha-blockade. Due to its side effects\u2014for example, orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia\u2014especially after administering the initial dose, its dose should be increased slowly. Alpha- and beta-blockers should be continued until the morning of surgery.\nPrazosin, Doxazosin, Terazosin, Tamsulosin \u2013 Prazosin, doxazosin, terazosin and tamsulosin are selective \u03b11-antagonists. Their main cardiovascular action is decreasing SVR and PVR with only minimal increases in heart rate. Prazosin acts on arteries and veins. Prazosin and doxazosin are indicated for treatment of chronic hypertension. Terazosin blocks vascular \u03b11B, as well as \u03b11A receptors in the prostate and bladder neck. It is used for treatment of benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) and hypertension. Tamsulosin is a selective \u03b11A receptor blocker used for symptomatic BPH and to help with passage of kidney stones. Orthostatic hypotension with syncope may occur with the use of peripheral \u03b1-blockers, especially after the first dose.\nTolazoline \u2013 Tolazoline is a nonselective competitive \u03b1-adrenoceptor antagonist, structurally similar to phentolamine. It acts as a sympathomimetic and also stimulates muscarinergic ACh-receptors and causes histamine release. It decreases systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. It markedly increases heart rate and may provoke arrhythmias due to its sympathomimetic effects and the reflex sympathetic activation associated with its use. Although it is used to treat persistent pulmonary hypertension in neonates, it is not a selective pulmonary vasodilator, and may worsen the SVR/PVR ratio when fixed pulmonary hypertension is present.\n",

These agents potentiate the effects of anesthetics and may substantially reduce anesthetic and narcotic requirements. Central \u03b12 receptor agonists may exacerbate depression and are contraindicated for management of hypertension in patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.\nClonidine \u2013 Clonidine is a centrally acting \u03b1-agonist with near selectivity on \u03b12-receptors (220:1 \u03b12 to \u03b11 effect). As a partial agonist-antagonist, it elicits submaximal response on central pre-and post-junctional \u03b12-receptors while blocking the effects of other agonists. It is a coronary vasodilator and acts as a sympatholytic\u2014a property utilized to manage withdrawal symptoms in opioid and alcohol addicts. Clonidine effectively reduces SVR, PVR, and renal vascular resistance. Its half-life is 12 hours.Clonidine blocks pain signal transmission in the brain. It may potentiate opioid effects on the central nervous system and has local anesthetic properties. When administered epidurally, it produces dose-dependent analgesia not reversed by opioid antagonists\u2014an effect utilized in the treatment of cancer pain. It doubles the duration of intermediate-duration local anesthetics when used as adjunct to peripheral nerve blocks. Due to risk of hypotension and bradycardia, epidural clonidine is not recommended in the perioperative, obstetric, and postpartum setting. It causes sedation in a dose-dependent manner. Due to lack of adequate data, it should not be administered above the C4 dermatome.Clonidine should not be discontinued abruptly, as rebound hypertension is frequently triggered. Its immediate-release oral formulations should be discontinued within 4 hours before surgery and resumed as soon as possible in the early postoperative period.\nMethyldopa \u2013 Methyldopa is a centrally acting antihypertensive. Its mechanism of action is not fully elucidated. Its antihypertensive effects are most likely due to its metabolism to \u03b1-methyl-norepinephrine, which stimulates central inhibitory \u03b1-receptors and lowers blood pressure by false neurotransmission and possibly by reducing plasma renin activity. It has no direct effect on cardiac and renal function. Reversible thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, a positive Coombs test, and liver dysfunction including fatal liver necrosis has been reported with the use of methyldopa. Despite these adverse effect, methyldopa is still commonly used for the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension due to the lack of adverse effects of long-term treatment on the fetus.\nGuanabenz \u2013 Guanabenz is an oral antihypertensive active on central \u03b12-receptors. Its action is mediated by bulbar \u03b12 activation, leading to attenuated sympathetic outflow at the level of the brain stem. It effectively controls blood pressure without significant effects on renal function. It frequently causes sedation; therefore, additive sedative effects should be considered when used with other centrally acting depressants. Its abrupt discontinuation may rarely result in an increased production of endogenous catecholamines and subsequent rebound hypertension. In patients with coexisting liver and kidney disease, careful monitoring of blood pressure is recommended.\nGuanfacine \u2013 Guanfacine is a selective oral central postsynaptic \u03b12A\u2013receptor agonist with a duration of action longer than that of clonidine. It reduces sympathetic outflow and with resultant decrease in heart rate and vasomotor tone. Guanfacine preferentially binds postsynaptic \u03b12A\u2013receptors in the prefrontal cortex, and modulates behavioral responses. Its immediate release form is used for management of hypertension, whereas its extended release form is used for treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder as monotherapy or as adjunct to central nervous system stimulants. Its dose should be reduced with concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors, and slowly increased with the use of CYP3A4 inducers.\nDexmedetomidine \u2013 Dexmedetomidine is a selective central \u03b12A and peripheral \u03b12B\u2013agonist with sedative and anesthetic properties. Centrally, it reduces sympathetic outflow and inhibits norepinephrine release at regular doses. At high doses, it activates peripheral \u03b12B receptors with resultant vasoconstriction, increased SVR, PVR, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and central venous pressure. Its use is indicated for procedural sedation for awake fiberoptic intubation, as well as sedation of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit. Its initial loading dose is 1 mcg/kg over 10 min, followed by a maintenance rate of 0.2\u20130.7 mcg/kg/hour, administered via a controlled infusion device, and titrated to effect. No dose adjustments are required in patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, dose reduction is recommended. It may cause episodes of hypotension, bradycardia, or sinus arrest. These adverse effects are enhanced in the presence of beta-blockers and antihypertensive agents, as well as in patients with advanced age, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing heart block, bradycardia, hypovolemia, or depressed ventricular function. Limited information is available regarding its use in pregnancy. Dexmedetomidine is expected to cross the placenta.\n",

Decreases in glomerular filtration rate may occur. For this reason, ACE inhibitors are used with caution in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction and are not recommended for patients with renal artery stenosis. Hyperkalemia is possible due to decreased production of aldosterone. The risk of hyperkalemia is greatest in patients with recognized risk factors (congestive heart failure with renal insufficiency). Measurement of plasma concentrations of potassium may be indicated in treated patients.

Exaggerated hypotension attributed to continued ACE inhibitor therapy has been responsive to crystalloid fluid infusion and/or administration of sympathomimetics such as ephedrine or phenylephrine. If hypotension is refractory to treatment, treatment with vasopressin is usually effective. ACE inhibitors may increase insulin sensitivity and hypoglycemia, which is a concern when these drugs are administered to patients with diabetes mellitus.\nCaptopril \u2013 Captopril is an oral vasodilator that inhibits the formation of angiotensin II in the lung. The subsequent decrease in plasma AT-II levels leads to decreased arterial and venous vasomotor tone, generally without eliciting tachyphylaxis or reflex hemodynamic changes.In common with all ACE inhibitors, captopril reduces preload and afterload on the heart. It promotes renal excretion of sodium and water, reducing the circulating blood volume. Treatment with captopril is associated with survival benefit after myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or hypertension. Captopril may delay the development of renal disease in patients with diabetes mellitus, and counteracts ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.Also in common with all ACE inhibitors, captopril may reversibly reduce kidney perfusion and decrease kidney function. Patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis are at risk for kidney failure. Due to suppressed aldosterone activity, hyperkalemia may occur. A common side effect is chronic nonproductive cough, secondary to the inhibition of the breakdown of bradykinin. Angioedema, a life-threatening condition potentially causing airway obstruction, is a rare adverse effect.\nEnalapril and Enalaprilat \u2013 Enalapril is an oral ACE inhibitor used for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The therapeutic and side effects of enalapril are very similar to those of captopril. As an inactive prodrug, it first must undergo hepatic metabolism into its active form, enalaprilat.Enalaprilat is an intravenous ACE inhibitor, used primarily to treat severe hypertension. Its therapeutic and side effects are similar to those of captopril. It has a duration of action longer than nitrates, eliminating the need for continuous infusion. Enalaprilat decreases peripheral vascular resistance without eliciting reflex tachycardia, an increase in cardiac output and myocardial oxygen consumption.\nLisinopril and Ramipril \u2013 Lisinopril and ramipril are oral ACE inhibitors\u2014prodrugs used for the treatment of hypertension. They must first undergo hepatic metabolism into their active form. Their therapeutic and side effect profile is very similar to that of captopril. In renal insufficiency, dose adjustment is required.\nFosinopril \u2013 Fosinopril is an oral ACE inhibitor used for the treatment of hypertension. It must be converted into an active metabolite in the liver and the gastrointestinal tract. It is eliminated by biliary excretion, therefore, unlike other ACE inhibitors, it does not need dose adjustment in patients with kidney insufficiency.\nPerindopril, Trandolapril, Moexipril \u2013 Perindopril, trandolapril, and moexipril are oral ACE inhibitors used for management of left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarct, as well as treatment of hypertension. These prodrugs must be hydrolyzed in the liver into their active metabolites. Their action and side effect profile is similar to that of captopril.\n",

Examples are the rapid-acting antianginal nifedipine, the long-acting vasodilator nicardipine, the highly lipid-soluble nimodipine (favoring cerebral vessels), amlodipine, felodipine, or isradipine.\nNifedipine \u2013 Nifedipine is primarily indicated in the management of Prinzmetal angina. Only its extended-release formulations are recommended for the treatment of hypertension, as well as the management of Raynaud\u2019s disease. Conventional (immediate-release) formulations are contraindicated in the management of acute myocardial infarction due to its negative inotropy and reflex sympathetic activation.\nNicardipine \u2013 Nicardipine is a highly potent peripheral vasodilator that inhibits calcium influx into the myocardium and vascular smooth muscle. Nicardipine has no effects on the SA node and AV node. It produces clinically insignificant negative inotropy, and may be combined with a beta-blocker for the treatment of angina. This drug has the greatest vasodilating effects of all the CCBs, with vasodilation being particularly prominent in the coronary arteries. Because of all the antianginal drugs dihydropyridines produce the greatest peripheral vasodilation, either nifedipine or nicardipine may be useful in patients who have residual hypertension despite adequate beta-adrenergic blockade. Nicardipine produces dose-related decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Nicardipine is frequently used as a tocolytic. When administered, it binds to the inside of the myometrial L-channels causing them to remain closed, and inhibiting uterine contractions. Pulmonary edema has been reported when nicardipine was used as tocolytic. Its use is contraindicated in patients with severe aortic stenosis: A decrease in diastolic pressure may worsen myocardial oxygen balance.\nNimodipine \u2013 Nimodipine is a highly lipid-soluble analogue of nifedipine. This high degree of lipid solubility facilitates its penetration into the central nervous system, where it blocks the influx of extracellular calcium necessary for contraction of large cerebral arteries. This is especially valuable during the treatment and prevention of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nimodipine has minimal negative inotropic effect on the myocardium.\nAmlodipine \u2013 Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist only available in oral form, with minimal cardiodepressant effects. Its anti-ischemic effects are comparable to beta-blockers in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The combination of amlodipine and a beta blocker is more effective in the treatment of myocardial ischemia than either drug alone. Its actions are resembling those of nifedipine. It is used primarily for oral treatment of hypertension.\nFelodipine \u2013 Felodipine is primarily a peripheral vasodilator with no clinically significant negative inotropy.

Its mechanism of action is not fully understood. It appears to interfere with calcium movements within the cell that initiate and maintain the contractile state. Hydralazine decreases systemic blood pressure (systolic less than diastolic). Hydralazine may produce reflex sympathetic nervous system stimulation: It increases renin and AT-II activity, which leads to aldosterone stimulation and sodium reabsorption; tachycardia and increased myocardial contractility results in an increase in cardiac output, and may provoke angina. Patients with coronary artery disease should be monitored for myocardial ischemia. The use of hydralazine to treat pulmonary hypertension is not recommended since the associated systemic vasodilation may result in systemic hypotension. Hydralazine has a relatively slow onset of action with peak effect occurring by 20 min. With chronic PO use, a lupus-like reaction may occur.\nNitroglycerine \u2013 Nitroglycerine is a direct coronary vasodilator with greater effects on the venous than on the arterial system.

Nitroprusside lacks effect on nonvascular smooth muscle and the myocardium; however, reflex tachycardia and increased inotropy may occur, making it an undesirable drug of choice for the treatment of aortic dissection, where shear forces should be minimized. Its immediate onset of action and short duration allows for IV infusion and precise titration of dosage.\n",

Nitric oxide is the active mediator in the vasodilating effects of SNP: It activates the guanylate cyclase present in vascular smooth muscle and increases cGMP, which in turn decreases Ca2+ entry into the cell and intracellular Ca2+ concentration.",

Availability of thiosulfate is the rate-limiting step in cyanide detoxification. Excess cyanide ions immediately react with methemoglobin to form cyanmethemoglobin. When sulfur donors and methemoglobin are exhausted, unscavenged free cyanide radicals may accumulate and bind to tissue cytochrome oxidase, to inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

Thromboxane A2 induces vasoconstriction and promotes platelet activation, whereas PGI2 is a vasodilator with platelet inhibitor effects. In pulmonary arterial hypertension, their physiologic balance is shifted toward thromboxane A2. This promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation, vasoconstriction, and thrombogenesis. The activity of prostacyclin synthase is decreased in pulmonary hypertension, leading to low levels of the vasodilator and antiproliferative PGI2. Restoring the balance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors, including the administration of prostacyclin analogues, is a mainstay of the medical management of pulmonary hypertension.\nEpoprostenol \u2013 PGI2-analogue epoprostenol is used for the long-term treatment of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension associated with scleroderma spectrum diseases. It improves functional class, exercise tolerance, and hemodynamics. Its 2 main pharmacological actions are: (1) direct pulmonary and systemic vasodilation, and (2) platelet inhibition. It is an afterload reducer for both the left and the right ventricle. It produces dose-related decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance; it increases stroke volume and cardiac output.Epoprostenol is usually administered as a continuous infusion into a central vein. Dosing must be individualized; however, optimal dose range for long-term therapy is believed to be 25\u201340 ng/kg/minute, when used as monotherapy. Alternatively, it may be delivered as an inhaled aerosol, for example for the treatment of acute right ventricular failure in the intraoperative or early postoperative setting. Common side effects are headache, flushing, nausea, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain. Contraindications to its chronic use include congestive heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, pulmonary edema during initial treatment, or known hypersensitivity to epoprostenol or structurally related agents. Abrupt withdrawal or sudden dose adjustments should be avoided. Its use should be limited to centers experienced with its administration and with systematic follow-up with patients.\n\nIloprost \u2013 Iloprost is a stable prostacyclin-analogue delivered as an inhaled aerosol to patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary hypertension associated with scleroderma spectrum diseases or appetite suppressants, or pulmonary hypertension related to chronic thromboembolic disease. In the acute setting, iloprost decreases pulmonary vascular resistance; with long-term use, in addition to its pulmonary vasodilator effects it suppresses pulmonary vascular smooth vessel proliferation.Iloprost is delivered as an inhaled aerosol. It is approved for functional class III and IV to relieve symptoms, enhance exercise tolerance, and diminish disease progression. Its adverse effects are similar to those of epoprostenol. Its use should be avoided in pre-existing hypotension. It may induce bronchospasm in patients with reactive airway disease. Caution should be used with its administration in the presence of increased risk of bleeding, anticoagulation, or other bleeding disorders.

Its main actions are pulmonary arterial vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. It is approved to decrease exercise-related symptoms and diminish clinical deterioration.Treprostinil may induce symptomatic hypotension. It may increase risk of bleeding. There appears to be an increased risk of Gram-negative bloodstream infections, especially in patients receiving intravenous treatment via a chronic indwelling catheter.

ST-changes in the high (I-aVL) and low (V5, V6) lateral leads reflect compromised flow through the left circumflex artery. The inferior wall (leads II, III, and aVF) is supplied by the right coronary artery in 80\u201390% of the cases, and by the left circumflex artery in the remaining 10%. A recognized immediate surgical complication of mitral valve surgery is left circumflex coronary injury, due to the proximity of the left circumflex artery to the mitral valve annulus: Any suture placed during mitral annuloplasty, or changes in coronary caliper as a result of a posterior leaflet plication may result in compromised blood supply to the lateral wall of the left ventricle. ST-segment elevations in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL indicate an extensive anterior myocardial infarct, and would most likely result from compromised flow through the left main coronary artery.\nD. Electrolyte abnormalities may cause ECG changes due to altered ion fluxed across the membrane resulting in altered transmembrane potentials. The cardiac effects of hypercalcemia (usually at levels greater than 15 mg/dL) are shortened PR or QT interval with or without widening of the QRS complex, flattened T-wave, or the Osborne-waves, typically seen in hypothermia. Treatment is hydration with normal saline to decrease plasma calcium levels by dilution, administration of non-thiazide diuretics, and avoidance of thiazides. Non-depolarizer muscle relaxant doses should be decreased in patients with hypercalcemia and muscle weakness. The cardiac effects of hyperkalemia are peaked T-waves at mildly elevated potassium levels (6\u20137 mEq/L), and wide or flat P wave, prolonged PR interval, wide QRS, prolonged QT, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole at higher serum potassium levels (10\u201312 mEq/L). Treatment is: (1) temporary membrane stabilization with IV calcium (commonly administered dose: 500 mg CaCl2 or 1 g Ca-gluconate), (2) inducing intracellular K + \u2212shift by administering intravenous insulin and glucose (commonly administered dose: 25 to 50 g intravenous dextrose along with 5 to 10 units of insulin), and (3) promoting excretion (diuretics, hemodialysis, resins). Slightly prolonged PR interval, shallow or biphasic T-waves, prominent U-waves, and ST-segment depression reflects hypokalemia; whereas prolonged QTc, third degree AV-block, torsades de pointes or ventricular tachycardia may reflect hypocalcemia.\nB. According to the most recent ACC/AHA guidelines, there is Class I recommendation for continuing beta blocker therapy in patients using beta blockers chronically. It may be reasonable to start beta blockers in patients with 3 or more RCRI risk factors; however, beta blockers should not be started on the day of surgery. Alpha-2 agonists are not recommended for risk reduction of major adverse cardiac events. It is a Class I recommendation to wait at least 14 days after percutaneous myocardial revascularization with balloon coronary angioplasty, 30 days after bare metal stent placement, and 365 days after drug eluting stent placement.\nA. Propofol is a GABAergic agent. It causes central nervous system inhibition by decreasing the rate of dissociation of GABA from its receptor, and prolonging the GABA-mediated chloride influx into the cell, causing membrane hyperpolarization. Its induction dose for a normovolemic adult patient with normal cardiac function is 2\u20132.5 mg/kg. Propofol decreases mean arterial pressure by producing direct myocardial depression and decreasing SVR. It alters the baroreceptor reflex and causes a disproportionally small compensatory increase in heart rate relative to the decrease in blood pressure. It decreases cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption, cerebral blood flow, and ICP; however, at high doses, it may significantly decrease cerebral perfusion pressure. Propofol may trigger histamine release, and allergic reactions are therefore possible. It is not associated with increased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.\nA. Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative interacting with numerous receptors: primarily, it acts as a glutamate-antagonist at both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors; additionally, it is an opioid receptor agonist (opioid-sparing effects) and an M2 muscarinergic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (bronchodilation). It interacts with nicotinergic and monoaminergic receptors, as well as with voltage-dependent Na+- and L-type Ca2+ channels. Its actions on the NMDA-receptors account for its psychomimetic, analgesic, and amnestic effects. The incidence of emergence delirium may be reduced by concomitant administration of a benzodiazepine and by minimizing external stimulation during emergence. Ketamine produces centrally mediated sympathetic activation: It increases plasma epinephrine levels, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure. It is the only anesthetic that increases peripheral arteriolar tone. In catecholamine-depleted patients, or in those with limited inotropic reserve, its intrinsic cardiodepressant properties predominate, and may cause hypotension. Absolute contraindications to the use of ketamine are hypersensitivity to ketamine or chemically related agents, significantly elevated blood pressure, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, active delirium or psychosis, porphyria, pregnancy, and preeclampsia.\nC. Etomidate is a lipid-soluble nonbarbiturate hypnotic and anesthetic without analgesic effects. It is a carboxylated imidazole, structurally unrelated to other intravenous anesthetics. It is frequently used for rapid intravenous induction of anesthesia at standard doses of 0.2\u20130.3 mg/kg. Its short duration of action is subsequent to its rapid redistribution to peripheral compartments. Etomidate causes minimal cardiorespiratory depression even in the presence of cardiac and pulmonary disease. It may increase heart rate and cardiac output by 3% to 4%, and may produce a 10\u201315% decrease in systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure. It decreases cerebral blood flow, CMRO2, and ICP. Even a single induction dose of etomidate suppresses cortisol production by inhibiting the activity of 11-\u03b2(beta)-hydroxylase. Etomidate causes pain on injection and it is associated with increased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. There are no absolute contraindications to the use of etomidate as an induction agent.\nA. Aortic stenosis, congenital or acquired, is the most common valvular disease in the United States. Most common etiologies are senile degeneration and congenital bicuspid aortic valve. Asymptomatic patients even with severe aortic stenosis carry a small risk of sudden cardiac death, whereas the occurrence of symptoms are ominous signs of poor outcome. The classic triad of symptomatic aortic stenosis are angina pectoris (life expectancy is about 5 years, unless the aortic valve is replaced), syncope (average life expectancy: 3\u20134 years), and congestive heart failure (average life expectancy: 1\u20132 years). Treatment is surgical.As the severity of the stenosis progresses, a pressure gradient develops between the left ventricle and the aorta, causing the left ventricular wall tension to increase (fixed increase in LV afterload). This leads to a compensatory increase in wall thickness. According to the law of Laplace, the wall tension within a sphere filled to any given pressure depends on the thickness of the sphere: Pressure = (2 * wall thickness * wall tension)/radius. Consequently, at a constant pressure, wall tension can be decreased by increasing the thickness of the sphere\u2019s wall: left ventricular wall tension = (LV pressure * radius)/2* LV wall thickness. Wall stress is a major determinant of myocardial O2 demand. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an increasing wall thickness but unchanged chamber size therefore reduces wall stress and O2 demand. Chamber size, contractility, and stroke volume are usually preserved until late in the disease process.The increasing LV wall thickness will eventually lead to impaired left ventricular relaxation and decreased compliance, and eventually a fixed stroke volume. To maintain an adequate stroke volume, preload augmentation is necessary.A thick, noncompliant heart has an increased basal myocardial O2 consumption. In the hypertrophied left ventricle, capillary density does not adapt to the increased wall thickness, and any decrease in coronary perfusion pressure will compromise myocardial O2 supply. Maintenance of adequate afterload to ensure adequate systemic diastolic and coronary perfusion pressure is essential in preventing hypotension and the resultant risk of subendocardial ischemia.Extremes of heart rate are poorly tolerated in patients with hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis. Maintenance of normal rate and sinus rhythm is essential, as a noncompliant left ventricle is unable to augment stroke volume to maintain cardiac output during bradycardic episodes to restore cardiac output, and excessive tachycardia will reduce coronary perfusion during diastole. Atrial contraction contributes up to 30% to 40% of the left ventricular filling, maintenance of sinus rhythm is essential, and any supraventricular arrhythmias should be aggressively treated.\nB. Patients with concentric LVH and a hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis are unable to augment cardiac output in response to any sudden decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Administration of an \u03b11- adrenergic agent\u2014for example, phenylephrine\u2014improves coronary perfusion pressure without adding to the already existing fixed afterload, and increasing myocardial work. Concomitant venoconstriction increases venous return and augments preload. Reflex bradycardia may improve myocardial O2 consumption. It is essential not to delay treatment of hypotension, as the thick myocardium is at risk for ischemia, further worsening cardiac output and coronary perfusion, leading to sudden death. Agents with the potential to increase heart rate or myocardial O2 consumption are not first choices for treatment of hypotension in this patient with severe aortic stenosis.\nC. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent used for the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It is used during cardiac arrest to aid defibrillation of recurrent or refractory ventricular fibrillation. Amiodarone has Na+, K+, Ca2+ \u2212 channel, as well as alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker properties. Its rate-dependent (rapid) administration may cause profound hypotension and bradycardia. Treatment is volume expansion, administration of vasoconstrictors and positive chronotropes, or temporary pacing.\nB. Norepinephrine is an endogenous catecholamine with peripheral post-synaptic \u03b11- and \u03b2 effects. Its peripheral \u03b1 effects predominate over its myocardial \u03b21 effects. The effects of norepinephrine mediated by \u03b22-receptors are not clinically significant. Norepinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor (MAP and SVR are increased) with mild positive inotropy. It does increase myocardial O2 requirements. Its \u03b2-induced positive chronotropy is counteracted by the reflex bradycardia resulting from the \u03b1-mediated increase in afterload. Norepinephrine does not significantly increase cardiac output; an effect different from that of phenylephrine (phenylephrine may decrease cardiac output). Norepinephrine is less likely to induce tachyarrhythmias than epinephrine, dobutamine, dopamine, or isoproterenol.\n",
