            "text": "The laying hen transfers large amount of antibody, referred to as IgY, to the egg yolk. This antibody gives immunity to its offspring (Klemperer, 1893). Using hen as an immunization host brings a number of advantages. An egg may contain 50 to 100 mg of IgY, of which 2 to 10% are specific antibodies (Schade and Hlinak, 1996). Moreover, for animal welfare, antibody production in hens is a refined method because the antibodies are harvested from the eggs. Therefore, no bleeding of the animal is necessary. The availability of a large amount of IgY from egg yolks makes it feasible to use this antibody in many applications such as passive immunization in human and veterinary medicine, and in diagnostics (Schade et al., 2005).",

Freund\u2019s adjuvant (FA), which is the most effective and common adjuvant used for antibody production in laboratory animals, leads generally to severe inflammation at the injection site. This disadvantage is rather linked to its complete form (Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant: FCA) than to the incomplete one (Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant; Leenaars et al., 1994, 1998). In birds, FCA, which is usually used at the first immunization, does not seem to result in the same severe lesions as in mammals. Studies using FCA in the laying hen for antibodies production did not mention any pathological lesions associated with this adjuvant (Svendsen et al., 1996; Kapoor et al., 2000; Li et al., 2006). However, the majority of Animal Care and Use Committees encourage the use of alternative adjuvants rather than the FA. The immunostimulating complexes matrix (IM) is a relatively new adjuvant that has been shown to induce an efficient humoral immune response in animal models and human clinical trials (Pearse and Drane, 2005).",

The plates were incubated at room temperature for 60 min and washed with PBS-T for 3 times. The peroxidase activity was revealed with tetramethylbenzidine (T-2885, Sigma Chemical Co.) in acetate buffer (pH: 5.5) containing 0.03% of H2O2. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the enzymatic reaction was stopped with 100 \u03bcL of 2 M H2SO4 and the optical density (OD) was read at 405 nm in ELISA reader (PR 5000, Lab systems Multiskan RC, Helsinki, Finland). The antibody titer was expressed as P/N values (Li et al., 2006), where P represents the net OD of IgY from immunized hens at 1:1,000 dilution and N, the OD of IgY from the control hens at the same dilution. The net OD of IgY from immunized hens was calculated as the OD values of IgY from immunized hens minus the OD of IgY from the control hens.",

The same findings are observed for other animal species by Levi et al. (1993), Lockyer et al. (1993), and Sj\u00f6lander et al. (1993). Furthermore, primary and secondary antibodies response magnitude induced by IM was significantly lower than that elicited by FA (P < 0.05). This may reflect the difference in the dose of antigen used for immunization with FA (100 \u03bcg) or IM (10 \u03bcg). But it has been reported that the necessary antigen dose required to mount a substantial antibody response can be considerably reduced (by 10- to 20-fold) when using immunostimulating complexes or immunostimulating complexes matrix (Coulter et al., 2003; Pearse and Drane, 2005). Because the side effects related to the use of the FA are small and of short duration, so for large-scale production of specific egg yolk antibody, it would be preferable to use FA because it induced higher antibody titers and costs much less than IM.",

Nevertheless anti-SE IgY obtained with the combined antigen preparation showed lower activity than anti-ST IgY, which could be explained by the fact that SE-OMP antigen could be less immunogenic than ST-OMP.
