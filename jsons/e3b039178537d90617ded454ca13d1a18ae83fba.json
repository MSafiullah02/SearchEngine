Many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support. Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high. Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true among the patient population over 65. Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress. We hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent/efferent neurons) in the lungs. TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression. We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes. We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.",

Abnormal chest CT scans showing bilateral multiple peripheral ground-glass opacities has been observed in 98 % of hospital cases [2] . These pulmonary changes are likely responsible for both systemic and localized immune response leading to a hyperinflammatory state. The mortality rate in patients is suspected to be related to virally driven cytokine storm similar to that seen in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The cytokine storm is a result of a severe immune reaction in the lungs as measured by high levels of inflammatory markers (c-reactive protein, serum ferritin) and cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1) in the plasma [1] . ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 as compared to non-ICU patients, suggesting that the presence of high circulating cytokine levels is associated with the severity of the disease [2, 5] . The current urgent need for effective treatment of this life-threatening disease by targeting hyper-inflammation in the lungs, is of high, compelling interest. Although use of corticosteroids might be beneficial in reducing inflammationinduced lung injury, evidence from SARS and MERS patients shows no or little improvement in mortality rates, with a delay in viral load clearance [6, 7] . An anti-inflammatory therapy using a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 is currently undergoing phase III trial in COVID-19 patients [8] and could lead to promising results. The effectiveness of this therapy depends on the control of a single factor (IL-6) in this multidimensional process. It is possible that the approach will be limited in efficacy and it might be necessary to interfere with the inflammatory cascade at a higher level (i.e., eliminating the pro-inflammatory efferent pathway) to appropriately control the multimodal aspect of this inflammatory process.",

The crosstalk between TRPV1 positive nerve fibers and immune cells is critical in mediating inflammation of the airway following exposure to either inhaled allergens or viral infection [13, 14] . TRPV1 is strongly implicated in the regulation of irritant-induced airway responses and cough [15] . The expression of TRPV1 positive cells is increased in the airways of patients with chronic cough [18] . Activation of TRPV1 enhances the release of several pro-inflammatory molecules, including substance P (sP), and cytokines such as IL-6.

This upregulation can drive an inflammatory cascade in the lungs leading to airway hyperactivity and is dependent on the viral load and duration of infection. Interestingly, treatment with TRPV1 antagonist in this study significantly inhibited TRPV1 upregulation post viral infection. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with TRPV1 receptors has not yet been investigated but given the respiratory pathophysiology in COVID-19 cases, may exhibit similar mechanisms that can result in sensitizing TRPV1 receptors resulting in hyperinflamed lungs and associated complications. In accord with the aforementioned studies, Baral P. and colleagues demonstrated the role of sensory neurons expressing TRPV1 receptors in the lungs in a model of lethal MRSA pneumonia. These experiments showed that downregulation of the TRPV1 positive channels provided a protective pulmonary environment associated with neutrophil infiltration, enhanced T cell responses and bacterial clearance. Further, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) released from the TRPV1 nerve endings during infection downregulates innate immune responses. Therefore, ablating TRPV1 positive cells and inhibiting CGRP release resulted in improved survival outcomes in MRSA infected mice, thus exposing TRPV1 as a potential therapeutic target in combating pneumonia and associated mortality [9] .",

Critically ill patients suffering from ARDS are by-definition hypoxemic, which makes mechanical ventilation and oxygen-therapy a life-saving strategy. Unfortunately, both therapies represent a great challenge due to intrinsic complications. Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI) has been identified as a potential adverse effect of mechanical ventilation. Repetitive cyclic stretch and the resulting regional overdistention is associated with complications leading to pulmonary edema, barotrauma and further hypoxemia. These complications accelerate the deterioration of the pulmonary function. Michalick et. al. [10] demonstrated the role of TRPV1 as an amplifier of TRPV4-mediated response and lung epithelial barrier failure for VILI. Using a knockout mice model, the authors observed that mechanical stress activating TRPV4 and TRPV1 positive cells amplified Ca+ signaling, and that inhibition of these receptors reduced the endothelial [Ca+] response to high pressure inflation. This finding suggests that ablation of TRPV1 positive pathways could be beneficial for the prevention or treatment of ventilatorassociated lung injury. Hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI) as a result of high inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) during prolong times, in addition to mechanical ventilation, will increase lung inflammation, microvascular permeability and lung epithelial apoptotic cell death [11] . An initiating factor involved in this type of lung injury is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that will activate a signaling cascade leading to overproduction of substance P (by TRPV1 activation) with subsequent increase in cytokines levels [12] . The role of TRPV1 positive cells in HALI has been described [12] . Data showing the significantly prolonged survival of TRPV1 knockout mice after prolonged exposure to high FiO2 suggests the crucial role of substance P in the amplification of the inflammatory cascade leading to the deterioration of pulmonary microenvironment and function.",

The incidence of fatality associated with older patients, especially people over 65-years-old, might be exacerbated by the proinflammatory function of TRPV1 afferent nerves in the lungs. This in addition to a declining immune function in people as they get older making them more susceptive to infections, and the impact of higher comorbidities in the elderly population could be contributing factors and help explain the progression and disproportionate impact of COVID-19 in the elderly.",

Blocking lung sensory neurons signaling could result in inactivation of efferent system decreasing associated inflammation and cytokine storm adverse effects. Baral P and colleagues have further demonstrated that chemical ablation of pulmonary sensory neurons expressing TRPV1 receptors (by use of a highly potent TRPV1 agonist) dramatically improved survival against MRSA cytokine storm lethal pneumonia in a mouse model of the disease. In the experiments, they had no fatalities in the chemically ablated neuron groups versus an 80% fatality in the untreated control group. Ablation of TRPV1 expressing neurons and the inhibition of associated CGRP release resulted in control of neurogenic inflammation and improved the overall survival outcome in the infected mice [9] . Silencing TRPV1 afferent pathways as part of the treatment for COVID-19-related pneumonia/ARDS will not only address the intrinsic pathophysiology of the viral infection and systemic inflammation, but should also help reduce the complications associated with the current gold-standard therapy (mechanical ventilation/oxygen therapy) in severely compromised patients.",
