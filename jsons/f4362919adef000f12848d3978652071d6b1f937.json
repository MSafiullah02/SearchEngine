They may be linked to the potential neurotropism of the SARS-COV-2 virus, as previously demonstrated for other coronaviruses. We report here the description of a multicenter retrospective-prospective observational study promoted by the Italian Society of Neurology (SIN), involving the Italian Neurological Departments, who will consecutively recruit patients with neurological symptoms and/or signs, occurred at the onset or as a complication of COVID-19. Hospitalized patients will be recruited either in neurological wards or in COVID wards; in the latter cases, they will be referred from other specialists to participant neurologists. Outpatients with clinical signs of COVID and neurological manifestations will be also referred to participating neurologists from primary care physicians. A comprehensive data collection, in the form of electronic case report form (eCRF), will register all possible neurological manifestations involving central nervous systems, peripheral nerves, and muscles, together with clinical, laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid, if available), imaging, neurological, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological data. A follow-up at hospital discharge (in hospitalized patients), and for all patients after 3 and 6 months, is also planned. We believe that this study may help to intercept the full spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and, given the large diffusion at national level, can provide a large cohort of patients available for future more focused investigations. Similar observational studies might also be proposed at international level to better define the neurological involvement of COVID-19.",

A recent self-reported questionnaire on 59 COVID hospitalized patients in Milan revealed a 20% prevalence of olfactory and taste disorders [3] . A retrospective observational study by Mao et al. [4] collected, from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020, two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with severe COVID infection in three hospitals of Wuhan, China. Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, and skeletal muscle injury. At present, this is the first and only report on detailed neurologic manifestations of the hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and authors observed that involvement of the nervous system carried a poor prognosis. Therefore, they called physicians to pay close attention to any neurologic manifestations, in addition to the symptoms of respiratory system. Furthermore, on March 4, 2020, Beijing Ditan Hospital reported for the first time a case of viral encephalitis and the researchers confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid by genome sequencing [5] . Autopsy reports in some deceased patients have revealed brain tissue edema and partial neuronal degeneration [6] . A further series of patients has been recently reported from Strasbourg, France: agitation and corticospinal tract signs were reported in 69% and 67% of the patients, respectively [7] .",

Stroke patients with COVID may have a worse prognosis, for many reasons (delays in transports to hospitals and in diagnostic procedures with decreased thrombolytic and thrombectomy treatments, lack of intensivecare units, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic status).

The main aim of this retrospective-prospective observational study, therefore, is to collect the maximum number of patients with neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, to describe their temporal relation with COVID-19 symptomatology and to follow them for up to 6 months. Indeed, neurologists need to pay close attention to COVID-19 neurological manifestations, which may have contributed to their demise, especially for those with severe infections. Furthermore, when seeing patients with neurological manifestations in this pandemic period, neurologists should consider COVID-19 infection as a possible concomitant pathology, so to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and prevention of transmission.",

It would be better, at this point, to avoid collection of data from small case series and plan multicenter studies, to include a large number of patients on a national basis, under the auspices of the Italian Society of Neurology (SIN). This preliminary analysis will represent a useful referral for both the neurological scientific community and the authorities, to further dissect the different aspects of the neuroCOVID-19, addressing further researches in areas of specific interest. Close monitoring of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 may also provide indications for specific diagnostic and/ or therapeutic procedures of unpredictable benefit in subsets of COVID-19 patients with various central or peripheral neurological involvement.",

The study may also largely contribute in shedding light on the pathogenesis of the neurological complications in COVID-19 that is probably complex, involving a currently unknown set of interactions between viral properties, tissue susceptibility, and host immune response even in the nervous system. The study may also add in recognizing that some patients that recover from COVID-19 may complain of lasting neurological sequelae that may have been overlooked at the time of acute illness. Therefore, long-term follow-up for neurological deficits may be considered as essential in Italy and the rest of the world. Furthermore, the gained sensitivity of the new generations of neurologists in the residency programs will be a contributing factor in further defining the multiple neuroclinical features of COVID-19 [14] .",
