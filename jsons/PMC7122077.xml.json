Rapidly changing pressures between tissues of different densities lead to primary injury, while damage from projectiles and surrounding structures in the proximity of the blast results in secondary and tertiary injury, respectively (see Fig. 5.1). Primary injury has been shown to affect the tympanic membranes, lungs, and hollow viscera more frequently than other organ systems; however, injuries produced through secondary and tertiary injury are dependent on a number of different variables and can be extremely unpredictable [1]. Blast injury, most commonly from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), has been the primary mechanism of injury in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, though recent attacks on civilian populations have also forced civilian trauma centers to resuscitate and manage blast-injured patients (see Fig. 5.2).\n\n",

Following the tympanic membrane, the lung is the most commonly injured organ in blast-associated trauma. Excessive fluid administration during resuscitation in these patients would exacerbate any underlying lung trauma and potentially result in severe respiratory distress. However, patients with extensive secondary and tertiary injuries who present with signs of hemorrhagic shock will require immediate and focused resuscitative efforts.",

The rise in crystalloid resuscitation corresponded with the development of technology capable of separating whole blood into components. Blood products could now be stored for longer periods of time, but emergency resuscitation with blood products became much more difficult as each product required significant preparation prior to transfusion. Crystalloid offered a quicker, cheaper means of rapidly supporting depleted intravascular volume and restoring perfusion pressure in hemorrhaging patients [5]. In addition, the logistical requirements for shipping, storing, and carrying crystalloids are much lower compared to blood products, which made them particularly attractive for application in resource-constrained settings such as the battlefield.",

The utilization of one fluid or the other is driven by cost and practicality. Compared to colloid, crystalloid is less expensive per unit but requires a larger transfusion volume to produce a significant change in intravascular volume status. In the civilian setting, where EMS providers are able to carry liters of NS or LR at all times, crystalloid is typically the resuscitative fluid of choice because it is cheaper. However, in the military, in austere and far-forward settings, colloids are preferred due to weight and volume considerations.",

First, and perhaps most importantly, rapidly restoring perfusion pressure prior to the definitive surgical control of bleeding increases the likelihood of \u201cpopping the clot\u201d and rebleeding from the initial wound. First described in 1918 by Dr. W. B. Cannon [8], a US Army surgeon in World War I, rebleeding secondary to resuscitation only gained traction in the trauma community in the early 1990s. In 1991, Bickell et al. compared resuscitation with 80 ml/kg LR to no resuscitation in a swine hemorrhage model and found that both hemorrhage volume and mortality rate were significantly higher in the group receiving LR when compared to the untreated group [9]. Building on this data, Bickell et al. then conducted a prospective trial in 1994 that compared immediate resuscitation to delayed resuscitation following surgical control of hemorrhage in penetrating torso trauma patients who presented with a systolic BP \u226490 mmHg. The group found that survival was higher in patients receiving delayed resuscitation compared to immediate resuscitation (70% vs 62%, p = 0.04) [4]. This landmark study definitively demonstrated the dangers of rebleeding following resuscitation.",

Up to 90% of isotonic crystalloid is ultimately \u201cthird-spaced\u201d to extravascular interstitial spaces, resulting in tissue swelling and further organ injury [10]. This phenomenon may be exacerbated by diffuse tissue injury produced by blast injury. The important association between massive fluid resuscitation and lung injury was described first during the Vietnam War, where soldiers with no evidence of lung injury developed acute respiratory distress syndrome following aggressive crystalloid resuscitation [11]. Additional studies have noted crystalloid resuscitation to be a risk factor for abdominal compartment syndrome in trauma patients with no abdominal injury (secondary abdominal compartment syndrome) [12, 13]. Specifically in blast-injured patients, third-spacing of fluid can easily exacerbate underlying lung injury from primary blast trauma and result in rapid respiratory compromise.",

Recent literature has demonstrated that hemodilution and ATC should be approached as two distinct entities. Hemodilution occurs with the administration of massive crystalloid volumes without compensatory supplementation of platelets, red blood cells, and clotting factors. Separately, ATC is a protein-C-mediated hypocoagulable state that can develop in severely injured patients [14\u201316]. While the two processes are distinct, they can be difficult to examine independently as hemodilution likely exacerbates ATC [14]. The study by Bickell et al. revealed that hemoglobin and platelet levels were significantly lower and prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were significantly longer in the immediate-resuscitation group when compared to the delayed-resuscitation group at admission; [4] each of these laboratory findings points to the presence of a coagulopathy. The study was not designed to elucidate the relative contributions of hemodilution and ATC to the development of coagulopathy, though it is likely that a combination of both processes resulted in the development of a hypocoagulable state. A final important point is the rapidity with which the coagulopathy developed: coagulopathy was present in these patients as they arrived, prior to any intervention [4].",

[17] explored the question using a swine hemorrhage model in 2003. The group found that in pigs subjected to massive hemorrhage and then resuscitated with LR, rebleeding occurred once the systolic BP reached 94 \u00b1 3 mmHg. The authors studied the effects of multiple injury sizes (1.5, 2.0, and 2.8 mm punch aortotomies) with the hypothesis that injury size would play a role in rebleeding. Interestingly, while larger injuries resulted in larger volumes of initial blood loss, the authors found no relationship between injury size and rebleeding systolic blood pressure. This finding further strengthened the conclusion that the propensity of a vessel to rebleed is driven predominantly by the blood pressure [17].",

Capone et al. showed that rats resuscitated to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mmHg prior to surgical control of bleeding had similar 2.5-h mortality but improved 3-day survival when compared to rats not resuscitated with any fluid prior to surgery [18]. More recently, Hampton et al. compared outcomes among 1200 level 1 trauma patients who either received no prehospital fluids (n = 191) or any prehospital fluids (n = 1009) [19].

Early coagulopathy develops in 20\u201330% of severely injured trauma patients and is a harbinger of future morbidity and mortality [21, 22]. In a retrospective review of 7638 trauma patients, MacLeod et al. showed that mortality was 3.6 times more likely in patients with an abnormal PT (95% CI 3.15\u20134.08) and 7.81 times more likely in patients with an abnormal PTT (95% CI 6.65\u20139.17) on admission [21]. Similarly, Brohi et al. reviewed 1867 trauma patients and found that patients who were coagulopathic on presentation had a higher mortality (46.0% vs 10.6%, p < 0.001) [22]. Importantly, the authors also noted that the development of coagulopathy was unrelated to the volume of crystalloid or colloid given to a patient [22]. These patients developed coagulopathy despite limited fluid resuscitation, suggesting that hypotensive resuscitation alone was insufficient at combating ATC.",

The study was a randomized controlled trial comparing blood product ratios of 1:1:1 and 1:1:2 (plasma, platelets, and PRBCs) during initial resuscitation [26]. This prospective and randomized study design minimized the likelihood that survival bias would significantly impact the study results. The authors found that while there was no overall mortality benefit associated with high-ratio resuscitation, patients who received a 1:1:1 ratio of plasma, platelets, and PRBCs achieved hemostasis more frequently and had fewer early deaths due to exsanguination than patients receiving 1:1:2 ratio resuscitation [26]. Further, the authors noted that the median time to death from hemorrhage was 2.3 h [26]. Following PROPPR, 1:1:1 has become standard empiric therapy for early resuscitative efforts in most US trauma centers, although there remains a significant debate about the optimal ratio of blood products for damage control resuscitation. What has become generally agreed upon is that an early balanced resuscitation focusing on both restoring circulating red blood cell mass and providing clotting factors and platelets is clearly superior to the previous strategy of administering larger volumes of crystalloids and then packed red blood cells and delaying initiation of plasma or platelet transfusion until much later in the resuscitation.",

Similarly, in a separate study, Guidry et al. evaluated fluid administration in trauma patients who received \u22654 units PRBCs and high-ratio resuscitation and found that higher volumes of crystalloid administration in the setting of DCR was associated with overall decreased survival [28]. Finally, Schreiber et al. randomized 192 trauma patients with an SBP <70 mmHg or with no palpable radial pulse in the field to receive either controlled resuscitation (250 mL initially and then 250 mL boluses for loss of radial pulse or SBP <70 mmHg) or standard resuscitation (2 L initially and then fluid as needed to maintain an SBP of 110 mmHg or greater) [29]. The authors noted that among blunt trauma patients, 24-h mortality was 3% in the controlled resuscitation group and 18% in the standard resuscitation group (OR 0.17, 95%CI 0.03\u20130.92) [29].

In theory, resuscitation using a 1:1:1 ratio of components should roughly approximate resuscitation with whole blood.

Up to 40% of coagulation factors from the whole blood unit are lost in the process; similarly, significant decreases in both platelet function and platelet number also occur [30].

Lipids and plasma isolated from non-leukoreduced stored blood have been shown to induce significant tissue injury in in vivo models [32]. Zallen et al. examined the relationship of age of blood to multiorgan failure by retrospectively comparing trauma patients who received between 6 and 20 units of RBCs in the first 12 h after injury. The authors found that patients who developed multiorgan failure received significantly older RBC units and that the age of RBC units was an independent predictor for multiorgan failure [33].

Further, the arrival of even one or two casualties requiring massive transfusion (>10 units PRBCs in 24 h) in quick succession could rapidly deplete the component reserve [36]. When blood components were unavailable or when demand was predicted to far outstrip the blood bank\u2019s supply of component therapy, whole blood became a reliable and necessary adjunctive therapy. One US CSH in Iraq described a massive transfusion protocol in which blood drive efforts began immediately upon the identification of a casualty requiring massive transfusion [36]. Casualties received a single massive transfusion pack (4 units PRBCs, 4 units FFP, 10 units cryoprecipitate) during the initial resuscitative effort but were transitioned to whole blood transfusion within an hour of arrival [36].",

The authors randomly assigned children to receive WFWB (Group I), whole blood administered 24\u201348 h after donation (Group II), or RBC, FFP, and platelets (Group III, component therapy) and measured 24-h blood loss to assess the degree of hemostasis. Blood was stored either at room temperature (Group I, WFWB) or 4\u20136 \u00b0C (Group II, delayed transfusion). There was no significant difference between groups in the volume of blood transfused. However, mean 24-h blood loss was much lower in the groups receiving whole blood (50.9 mL/kg in Group I, 44.8 mL/kg in Group II) than component therapy (74.2 mL/kg in Group III; p = 0.03). The generalizability of this study to the trauma population is questionable, though this early data does suggest a benefit for patients receiving young whole blood transfusion [37].",

As the process of leukoreduction of whole blood results in the removal of platelets, whole blood transfusions were supplemented with apheresis platelets (modified whole blood, or mWB). The primary outcome was total blood product use in the first 24 h. The authors found no differences in the 24-h RBC, plasma, or platelet use between the two study groups, nor were there differences in the median blood volume transfused in the first 24 h. However, a significantly larger percentage of patients with traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) were enrolled in the mWB group; after excluding all patients with TBI and repeating the analysis, the authors found that the 24-h RBC, plasma, platelet, and total product use were all significantly lower in the group receiving mWB. There was no difference in 24-h or 30-day mortality between the two groups in either the overall or subgroup analysis. The authors concluded that in patients without severe TBI, mWB reduced overall transfusion volume when compared to component therapy [38].",

            "text": "The two obvious concerns when using whole blood for resuscitation are the development of an acute transfusion reaction and the transmission of blood-borne pathogens, notably hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Transfusion reactions can occur either through host antibodies attacking donor cells or donor antibodies attacking host cells. Historically, group O blood has been considered universally compatible blood because group O RBCs should express no A or B antibodies. However, group O donor plasma can still contain anti-A or anti-B IgG that can produce a hemolytic reaction [41]. The concentrations of anti-A or anti-B can be quantified and loosely grouped into \u201chigh-titer\u201d and \u201clow-titer\u201d plasma; low-titer anti-A/anti-B whole blood is considered safer as it carries a lower risk of transfusion reactions [41, 42]. A study reviewing adverse events in the UK blood services found that the rate of total adverse reactions for transfusion of any blood product is 10 events per 100,000 components, with 0.4 transfusion-related deaths occurring per 100,000 components [43]. Specifically, the risk of a hemolytic reaction due to ABO incompatibility is around 1:80,000, while the risk of a plasma incompatibility reaction is around 1:120,000 [42]. In emergency situations, the benefits of transfusion of group O donor blood to nongroup O recipients generally outweigh the low risks of transfusion reactions outlined above, particularly if low-titer anti-A/anti-B donors can be preferentially utilized [41]. Further, the study by Nessen et al. examining WB use in combat casualties revealed no increased risk of utilizing group O whole blood as a universal donor [39].",

Rapid screening for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and HIV is performed on donated blood, but no FDA-approved rapid screening tests exist, and the current tests are around 85% sensitive. Transfused units are routinely screened retrospectively in the United States, and transmission rates remain extremely low [44]. Spinella et al. noted that among 2831 samples retroactively tested, 0.11% were positive for hepatitis C and 0.07% were positive for human T-lymphotropic virus; no samples were positive for either HIV or hepatitis B [45]. The authors also found that there was no difference in the rates of disease transmission when comparing units that did or did not receive prescreening using rapid antigen testing prior to transfusion [45]. In military settings, where soldiers are frequently screened for blood-borne diseases, the ability to maintain a disease-free walking blood bank is relatively reliable, and the benefits of transfusion surpass the minimal risk of disease transmission. Civilians are not subject to the same screening requirements as soldiers. Creation of a walking blood bank among a civilian population would require careful selection of potential donors, the implementation of significant screening policies, and improved (and FDA-approved) rapid testing to evaluate whole blood samples prior to transfusion.",

[57] conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing massive transfusion directed by TEG to massive transfusion directed by traditional coagulation tests. In both groups, abnormal lab values resulted in specific transfusion interventions. The authors found that survival was higher in the TEG group than the conventional coagulation testing group (p = 0.032) and patients in the conventional coagulation testing group required more plasma and platelets in the first 2 h of resuscitation (p = 0.022 and p = 0.041, respectively) [57]. The authors concluded that TEG-guided massive transfusion was a more efficient and effective means of resuscitation than massive transfusion guided by conventional coagulation assays. Tapia et al. [58] retrospectively compared TEG-guided therapy to empiric 1:1:1 therapy in a similar demographic of patients requiring massive transfusion and found that 1:1:1 therapy actually worsened mortality in patients with penetrating trauma who required more than 10 units of RBCs [58]. Combined, these data suggest that TEG-guided therapy is superior to therapy guided by conventional coagulation testing and can be tailored to the individual patient in a manner that empiric therapy cannot replicate (see Fig. 5.4).\n",

The two treatment modalities address two different elements: empiric therapy replaces what the patient is losing (whole blood) and temporizes the development of coagulopathy, while TEG-guided therapy corrects the specific coagulopathy. Empiric therapy with high-ratio 1:1:1 resuscitation should begin as close to the time of injury as possible. Once the source of hemorrhage is definitively controlled and the patient is no longer losing whole blood, TEG-guided therapy is warranted to address the residual coagulopathy [59]. Actively hemorrhaging patients typically reach the OR or the IR suite in a timely fashion; either of those areas can then serve as the \u201ctransition point\u201d to more directed resuscitative care. The combination of these resuscitative paradigms allows for the flexibility needed to appropriately treat hemorrhagic shock.",

Of particular concern in any blast-injured patient is primary injury to the lung as barotrauma represents a unique pathology not accounted for in the resuscitation literature described previously. Primary blast lung injury (PBLI) is due to a disruption of the alveolar septae with associated alveolar hemorrhage and impaired gas exchange [60]. PBLI typically manifests as pulmonary contusion with associated pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or tracheal injury. Patients with larger pulmonary contusions have a greater degree of respiratory compromise and often require mechanical ventilator support.",

Blood products should be preferentially administered over crystalloid in the setting of PBLI as the majority of a crystalloid transfusion will ultimately leave the intravascular space and exacerbate the underlying lung injury. Recent literature suggests that plasma helps to reconstitute the injured endothelium and glycocalyx following injury, while crystalloid causes further injury. This protective effect results in further reduction in third-spacing and reduced organ injury [61, 62]. To ensure that patients are not over-resuscitated, hypotension and volume status should be carefully assessed, and resuscitation should be guided by both the presence of coagulopathy and the intravascular volume deficit. As soon as the goals of resuscitation are achieved, patients with PBLI should be fluid restricted until PBLI resolves.",

While therapy should be initiated as early as possible, suspicion for PBLI should remain high, and patients should be assessed as early as feasibly possible for occult pulmonary injury and impaired ventilation. However, under-resuscitation of these patients is equally, if not more, detrimental to survival. Patients with PBLI and secondary and tertiary injuries will have low oxygen-carrying capacity secondary to hemorrhage and impaired oxygenation and ventilation secondary to lung injury. Garner et al. used a swine blast/hemorrhage model to compare the effects of hypotensive and normotensive resuscitation with NS in the setting of both blast injury and no blast injury [63]. The authors found that survival was significantly shorter in the hypotensive resuscitation group (~150 min) compared to the normotensive resuscitation group (~400 min; p < 0.01). The generalizability of this study is limited as the study used a non-survival model as well as NS as a resuscitation fluid. The findings should, however, underscore the importance of early resuscitation with blood products and the need for rapid definitive surgical control of bleeding followed by complete resuscitation.",
