This treatise suggests that diseases caused by cold or wind stroke invade the body through the pores in the skin. In recent decades, the effectiveness of many herbal formulae from Shang-han Lun has been validated in molecular biology studies and they have been used widely as complementary medical therapies. For example, the integrated use of formulae from the treatise with modern medicine has proved effective in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome  [5]. A study of Sinisan from the treatise demonstrated its therapeutic effect on chronic restraint stress  [6]. The benefit of a Wumei pill treatment for typhoid ascariasis was also confirmed  [7]. Xiao-chai-hu-tang was studied  [8], [9] for the treatment of liver injury and chronic pancreatitis. Clinical practice data for Shang-han Lun formula prescriptions in Taiwan were also analyzed  [10].",

Thus, quantitative analyses of the symptoms and their corresponding herbal prescriptions could help practitioners to find the treatment codes that are hidden inside this treatise. There are 381 sections in the treatise, where syndromes and prescriptions are described in most sections. For example, in section 13, a group of symptoms comprising headache, stiff neck, chills, fever, and floating pulse constitute one syndrome. A group of compatible herbs called the Gui-zhi formula, which contains Ramulus Cinnamomi, peony root, prepared licorice root, fresh ginger, and Chinese dates, are prescribed for this syndrome. It is obvious that there are two types of entities (symptoms and formulae) and three types of relationships (treatment relationships between syndromes and formulas, syndrome relationships between symptoms, and compatibility relationships between herbs) in this treatise. Analyzing these entities and their relationships may provide us with a new way of exploring this treatise.",

In general, herbs or symptoms are regarded as nodes. Edges are defined as relationships between nodes, such as compatibility relationships between herbs, co-occurrence relationships between symptoms, or more complex relationships obtained by data mining methods  [16]. Constructing homogeneous Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) networks containing one type of node is a popular approach. However, in  [17], a heterogeneous TCM network was studied with multiple types of nodes, including herbs, biomolecules, and syndrome. Our study was inspired by  [17], but our approach differs from their method because we used a multi-subnet composited complex network model (MCCN), which is a generalized complex network model for describing different types of entities and multiple types of relationships between the entities  [18], [19], to describe syndrome relationships between symptoms, compatibility relationships between herbs, and treatment relationships between syndromes and formulas. We investigated the topological characteristics of a composited network with multiple types of nodes and edges based on the degree of given relationships and the clustering coefficients of given relationships.",

            "text": "Another interesting subject is six-channel transmission. In this treatise, the progress of a disease is classified as Tai-yang, Yang-ming, Shao-yang, Tai-yin, Shao-yin, or Jue-yin, which represent six different developmental stages of a disease. The three yang channels are located in the exterior parts of the body, whereas the three yin channels are found in the interior parts. Cold or wind stroke invasion will damage the three yang channels first. If the disease progresses or it is mistreated, the disease\u2019s symptoms will develop throughout the interior yin channels. For example, a sick man may have syndromes in the Tai-yang channel, such as headache, stiff neck, chills, fever, and a floating pulse, so the Guizhi formula may be prescribed. However, if the man is mistreated and he has Yang-ming syndromes, such as constipation, perspiration with fear of heat but no fear of cold and huge pulse, then this means that the disease has progressed to the Yang-ming stage. The mechanism of six-channel transmission is rather complex, so we tried to identify symptoms that imply the movement of a pathogen among the six channels. By dynamic reorganization of the MCCN, we obtained six channel subnets (Tai-Yang, Yang-Ming, Shao-Yang, Tai-Yin, Shao-Yin, and Jue-Yin). After determining the strengths of the relationships between the subnets, we analyzed the relationships among the six channel subnets to find symptoms that implied the movement or transformation of pathogens.",

Subnet G1 has relationships between v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, and v6. The second relationships between nodes v1, v2, v4, v5, and v6 are illustrated in subnet G2. The third relationships among nodes v1, v2, v4, and v6 are shown in subnet G3. Given a compounding mapping, a composited network G will be generated. The compounding mapping indicates how the nodes and edges in G are generated. In Fig. 1(d), the nodes of G are assigned as the union set of the nodes of Gi and Gj, and the edges in G are also the union set of the edges of Gi and Gj. The weight of an edge in G indicates the number of subnets to which the edge belongs. The weight of an edge indicates a compounding relationship between nodes.

Six channel diseases feature different symptoms. Thus, symptoms that belonged to the same channel were densely linked, whereas those belonging to different channels were sparsely linked. Therefore, nodes belonging to the same channel had a higher cluster coefficient, whereas nodes with higher k and smaller c values belonged to different channels. For example, fever belonged to Tai-yang, Yang-ming, Shao-yin, and Jue-yin; therefore, the degree of the fever node was high but its clustering coefficient was small because the symptoms of these four types of channel diseases didn\u2019t occurred simultaneously. The clustering coefficients of nodes with the highest degree are shown in Table 1\n. We found that a high degree indicated a low clustering coefficient, and vice versa.

Thus, quantitatively exploring the underlying principles of this treatise is meaningful and interesting. In this study, we analyzed the symptoms, prescriptions, herbs, and their relationships in this treatise based on a MCCN, which is a generalized complex network model for describing multiple types of entities and the different types of relationships among them. This model allows subnet compounding to obtain a \u201clarge\u201d complex network with multiple types of relationships as well as reducing to \u201csmall\u201d complex networks with special types of relationships. We found that the MCCN method was effective for describing and analyzing two types of entities (symptoms and herbs) and three types of relationships (syndrome relationships among symptoms, compatibility relationships among herbal drugs, and treatment relationship between symptoms and herbal drugs).",

Based on subnet compounding using the MCCN, a composited network was obtained by compounding the two subnets, which included treatment relationships between symptoms and herbs. MCCN measures were defined for quantifying different types of relationships in the composited network. We proposed degree and clustering coefficients according to the given relationships. The power-law distribution of the syndrome subnet reflected the important role of Tai-yang disease in this treatise. The nodes in the herb subnet with high degrees and low clustering coefficients were harmonizing herbs. The nodes in the herb subnet with symptom neighbors that connected with others were specific herbs for treating a syndrome.",

Moreover, symptoms that suggested the movements and transformation of pathogens were found, which could help to prevent disease.",
