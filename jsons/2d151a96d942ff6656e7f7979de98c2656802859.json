Rank fusion is a relatively recent method for combining runs from multiple systems into a single ranking, and has been shown to significantly improve the ranking. This paper presents a novel extension to coordination level matching, by applying rank fusion to each sub-clause of a Boolean query. We show that, for the tasks of systematic review screening prioritisation and stopping estimation, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning to rank and bag-ofwords-based systems for this domain. Our fully automatic, unsupervised method has (i) the potential for significant real-world cost savings (ii) does not rely on any intervention from the user, and (iii) is significantly better at ranking documents given only a Boolean query in the context of systematic reviews when compared to other approaches.",

CLM is a ranking function originally proposed for Boolean queries that scores documents using the occurrences of documents retrieved by different clauses of the query. The proposed extension, coordination level fusion (CLF), has many advantages over CLM that enable it to use multiple weighting schemes (rankers) and different fusion methods dependent on the Boolean clauses. We use CLF to rank studies in the screening prioritisation task of systematic reviews. We further plan to study the use of a cut-off threshold tuned on training data to control when the screening of studies should be stopped based on the CLF retrieval score. The empirical results obtained on the CLEF Technology Assisted Review datasets [25, 26] show that CLF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods that consider similar settings, including the ranking method currently used in PubMed (a popular database to search for literature for systematic reviews).",

However, the main drawbacks of active learning are that a poor initial ranking will slow down the rate of learning, and that explicit human effort is required to update the ranking. While current practice prescribes all documents must be screened (therefore explicit assessments could be used for active learning), an initially poor ranking would require many assessments before the system is able to identify relevant documents. Thus the analysis of the full-text of eligible documents may be delayed. Automatic assessment has been suggested to be used in place of a second researcher performing screening [40] . Fully automatic methods of screening prioritisation allow for other processes of systematic reviews to begin earlier and do not require the effort of humans, saving more time (and costs). In this paper, we do not consider screening prioritisation methods based on active learning. However, we note that CLF could be used as the first pass ranking in the context of an active learning method. Then, active learning could be used to augment CLF to performing re-ranking in the presence of continuous, iterative relevance feedback. We leave the study of CLF in an active learning setting for future work.",

The screening prioritisation task has gained substantial interest from CLEF participants, with submitted methods including active learning [12, 13] , relevance feedback [4, 18, 21, 36, 38, 39, 52, 55] , automatic supervised [9, 17, 30, 47, 51] , and automatic unsupervised methods (which do not rely on any relevance feedback or human intervention) [2, 3, 7, 54] . Meanwhile, the stopping prediction task has seen little participation and na\u00efve techniques like static score-based cut-offs [24] , as well as techniques based on continuous relevance feedback [16] are used. Many of the participants also do not use the Boolean queries directly, instead resorting only to the title of the review (a sentence), which is contrived and unrealistic in the context of systematic review literature search. This work overcomes these shortcomings by only using the Boolean query to rank documents, with no additional effort required by the information specialist.",

The intuition behind CLM is that nested sub-clauses of a Boolean query could be considered as separate but related queries, and therefore documents that appear in multiple clauses should be ranked higher. For example, a very common way information specialists formulate Boolean queries for systematic review literature search is to break a search down into three of four categories based on the Population, Intervention, Controls, Outcomes (PICO) framework [8] . Query terms from each category become a clause in the Boolean query, grouped together by a single AND operator [8] . Formally, in CLM the score of a document d is the number of Boolean clauses of the query Q that are satisfied by it. A clause can be considered as both a single atomic keyword, and the grouping of several keywords or other nested groupings by a single Boolean operator (Boolean clause). Figure 1 visualises the differences between atomic clauses and Boolean clauses.",

Which weighting scheme to use for CLM is then unclear, and some documents may be ranked higher than others using different weighting schemes.

As systems and weighting schemes will typically assign wildly different scores to documents, scores are often normalised before fusion (e.g., using min-max normalisation).

This is achieved by applying the CLF fusion function to each document d as: Fig. 3 . Example query formatted to be issued to PubMed for re-ranking.

We model this task with an equivalent description: given a set of documents retrieved by a Boolean query, what is the subset of documents which does not need to be screened? In this work, stopping prediction is performed by exploiting the scores of documents for each atomic term after fusion. Rather than setting a fixed cut-off on scores similar to participants in the CLEF TAR task [24] , here a gain-based approach is used. Our approach is as follows: Given that researchers will screen documents starting at the first document and continuing to the next document for the entire list, they are accumulating gain from documents (equal to the document score) as they continue down the list of documents. Once enough gain from documents has been accumulated, they can stop screening. To model this, we use a \u03ba parameter to control what percentage of the total gain a researcher can accumulate before stopping. The stopping point therefore becomes the position of the document in the ranked list where the cumulative gain exceeds the total allowable gain. When \u03ba is set to 1, no documents are discarded. In the task of screening prioritisation, where documents are assessed, \u03ba is set to 1.",

The results of the CLF rankings are also compared to the rankings produced by the participants of the CLEF TAR task. Note that many of these participants do not rank directly according to the terms and structure of the Boolean query (while we do), and often consider the query as a bag-of-words, and incorporate terms from the title for re-ranking. Also note that many of the participants used feedback from the relevance assessments and created active learning solutions. The comparisons between participants and our results only consider those which reported to not use relevance assessments and do not use human intervention to rank (fully automatic, thus excluding active learning settings). In other words, we experiment considering the first round of retrieval. All experiments are run using the QueryLab domain-specific Information Retrieval framework [45] . To obtain statistics for ranking documents, the documents retrieved by each query are fetched from PubMed and indexed by Query-Lab. No stopwording or stemming is applied. The particular queries in this collection contain terms which are explicitly stemmed. Therefore, we use the PubMed Entrez API [44] to identify the original terms in documents from the explicitly stemmed term (this backward approach to stemming is to allow information specialists fine-grained control over their search). The title, abstract, MeSH headings, and publication date of each PubMed document is stored in four separate fields. When a title was not available for a document, the book title field was used instead; if no book title was available, the field was left empty (this replicates how searching on the title field works in PubMed).

The PubMed weighting scheme uses the state-of-the-art learning to rank system of Pubmed [20] . The best match ranking system of PubMed uses a three-stage ranking system: first, documents are retrieved using the Boolean query; then, documents are ranked using BM25; finally, top-ranked documents are re-ranked using LambdaMART trained on click data, using document features such as document length, publication date, and past usage. Note that the PubMed best match ranker can only rank documents given a term or phrase, not a Boolean query. After the first stage, the Boolean query is translated into a bag-of-words type of query, similar to those seen in web search (it is often the case that the query translation results in fewer documents retrieved). Therefore, by embedding the PubMed ranker into CLF, the query translation step may be skipped entirely. The term position weighting scheme is defined as the relative position of a term in a document (0 if the term does not appear in the document). Publication date scores documents higher if the document is newer (accounting for recency, linearly). Document length scores documents higher the longer the document is. Text score weights documents by the fields a term appears in: for example, a document is scored higher if a term appears in the title and the body than if the term appears only in the body. When queries are submitted to PubMed, they are modified to restrict them to only the PMIDs reported in the CLEF topic file (in order to account for minor discrepancies in retrieval after different time periods, see Fig. 3 for an example), and set the retrieval mode in PubMed to 'relevance' in order to obtain a ranked list of documents by relevance (instead of the default ranking by publication date). Prior to fusion for any clause, ranked lists are normalised using min-max normalisation. Z-score and softmax normalisation were also considered, however through early empirical testing, min-max normalisation provided the consistently higher effectiveness compared to z-score and softmax. When there are ties in the ranking, the document which has a more recent publication date is ranked higher. The different modifications made to CLF used in this paper are taxonimised below:",

For comparison between the CLEF TAR participants (of which we acquired the runs), the MAP measure is included. The nDCG measure is included as a more realistic model of user behaviour. Reciprocal rank (RR) is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of systems in an active learning scenario (to show how soon the first relevant document would be shown and an update to the ranking potentially triggered). Precision after R documents (Rprec) is used to show the theoretical best possible precision obtainable in the stopping task, along with last relevant (Last Rel) that reports at what rank position the very last relevant document was shown. Participant runs are chosen for comparison if they are a fully automatic, unsupervised method, which does not use the training data or explicit relevance feedback, and do not set a threshold (as categorised in the TAR overview papers [25, 26] ). Note that the tables in the CLEF TAR overview papers contain errors regarding these aspects, instead each of the participant's papers were considered to individually determine which runs to directly compare our methods to. For the stopping prediction task, several standard set-based measures are used: precision, recall, F \u03b2={0.5,1,3} , total cost, and reliability [11] . Reliability is a loss measure (i.e., where smaller values are better) specifically designed for the TAR task. It has two components: loss r = 1\u2212(recall) 2 and loss e = (n/(R +100) * 100/N ) 2 , where n is the number of documents retrieved, N is the size of the collection, and R is the total number of relevant documents. Therefore, Reliability = loss r + loss e . Participants runs are chosen if they are fully automatic, supervised or unsupervised (thus we consider approaches that used training data), do not use explicit relevance feedback, and do set a threshold. Runs are evaluated using trec eval or the evaluation scripts that are provided by the CLEF TAR organisers, where applicable. When used for predicting when to stop screening, \u03ba is tuned on training queries using a grid search to determine the best value. The parameter space searched in these experiments is {0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 0.95}. Note that \u03ba can be set at a clause-level, therefore it is possible for it to be adaptive based on the clause. We leave learning an adaptive \u03ba for future work, and here we fix \u03ba to a set value across all clauses.",

Comparing the CLM and CLF methods to the state-of-theart PubMed ranking, CLM is often statistically significantly worse than the PubMed ranker, whereas some CLF-based methods are able to perform statistically significantly better than the PubMed method. Next, the best performing CLF method (CLF+weighting+PubMed+qe) and the best performing CLEF participant method for each year is compared.

The CLF method does not perform statistically significantly better than these two methods in any evaluation measure considered (however in all measures apart from MAP and last relevant, CLF is better). For 2018 topics, the best performing method is Sheffield-general-terms (same as Sheffield-run-4 from 2017, however terms specifically designed to identify systematic reviews are added to the query) [2] .

Significant improvements over the original queries in terms of precision, F 1 , F 0.5 , F 3 , and total cost, with a tolerable reduction in recall can be observed.

The method, dubbed Coordination Level Fusion (CLF), outperformed the current state of the art for two different tasks. For the screening prioritisation task, CLF significantly outperformed the existing PubMed ranking system, as well as participants that submitted comparable runs to the CLEF TAR tasks. The results of the screening prioritisation task demonstrate the applicability of CLF to systematic review literature search when prioritisation is considered, and suggest it may also be applied to obtain an effective early ranking in settings that consider active learning. For the stopping prediction task, CLF could significantly reduce the cost of screening with tolerable losses in recall. The results of the stopping prediction task demonstrate the applicability of CLF to specific systematic reviews where total recall is not essential, such as in rapid reviews [34] .",

In this context, CLF can be used as the first ranker, before relevance feedback is collected. Then, feedback could be further weaved into CLF by devising and integrating weighting schemes that account for this. We also plan to investigate the use of CLF as a method for query performance prediction (e.g., as a postretrieval predictor using reference lists [50] , or as a candidate selection function in query transformation chain frameworks [48] ). In terms of extending CLF, the weighting schemes themselves can be weighted (i.e., one weighting scheme may have more importance over others); e.g., using the linear combination fusion method [53] which assigns weights to each ranker being fused. The problem then is learning the weight to assign to each weighting scheme (ranker) used for rank fusion. Rather than using fusion methods like CombMNZ, it is foreseeable to use a different combination of weights for each Boolean clause considered.",
