Mean squared error, percent average bias and 95% confidence interval coverage probabilities were all used to assess the efficiency of the methods. Based on these simulation results and the fact that the estimates for the real datasets were not clinically different, we chose to use interval reduced data to produce the estimates in this manuscript.
