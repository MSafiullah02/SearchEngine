The distribution of viruses detected in the respiratory specimen in the enrolled children is shown in Table 2. The commonest virus detected was rhinovirus (14; 60.8%). Mean (SD) follow-up duration in those who had viral infection and who had no viral infection was 15.7 (7.1) and 17.5 (5.4) months, respectively. Mean (SD) numbers of pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic prescription during follow-up were higher in Group I compared with Group II [4 (2.1) vs. 2.8 (1.7), p = 0.04]. Intravenous antibiotic usage and episodes of hospitalizations were significantly more in children who had a viral infection as compared with the others. Mortality was also significantly higher in children in whom virus had been detected (7; 30.4%) as compared with those in whom no virus could be detected in respiratory specimen (1; 4.7%), p = 0.04 (Table 3). In total, 14 children in Group 1 and 17 children in Group 2 could perform spirometry and parameters were shown in Table 3. Of the seven children who died in Group I, rhinovirus had been detected in five, adenovirus in one and coronavirus in one during the pulmonary exacerbation evaluated for viral infections. The course of illness of children infected with rhinovirus was compared with those who were infected with other viruses (Table 4). In Group I, three patients were newly colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one patient was colonized with beta-haemolytic streptococcus. Whereas in Group II, three patients were colonized with Pseudomonas and two patients were colonized with Staphylococcus aureus after virus isolation. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) was present in three children in Group I and five children in Group II. One patient was home oxygen-dependent intermittently in Group I. Eight children in Group I and one child in Group II required hospitalization at least once during their follow-up. Genetic testing was done in all children for DF508 mutation and four children (8.7%) were homozygous and eight children (17.4%) were heterozygous for DF508 mutation. All the patients were pancreatic insufficient. On univariate analysis, mortality was significantly associated with viral infection (p = 0.02) and general examination score (p = 0.04) and was not significantly associated with age at the time of CF diagnosis (p = 0.86), physical and nutrition scores (p = 0.26 and 0.27, respectively) and number of new colonizations (p = 0.55). On multivariate analysis by logistic regression model general and physical examination scores [odds ratio, OR 0.4 (0.8\u20131.99), p = 0.27 and 5.3 (0.3\u201389.9), p = 0.24, respectively], new bacterial colonization [OR 2.24 (0.07\u201367), p = 0.64] and presence of viral infection [OR 23.8 (0.8\u2013708), p = 0.06] were not associated with mortality.\n",

Viral infections predispose the respiratory epithelium to secondary bacterial infections by multiple mechanisms resulting in frequent pulmonary exacerbations [9, 10]. Rhinovirus has been reported as major viral pathogen in CF with detection rates reaching up to 87% from samples collected both during exacerbations and routine visits [12]. In our cohort too, rhinovirus was the most commonly detected (60.7%) virus. In a prospective multi-birth cohort study by Armstrong et al. [6] on viral infection in infants with CF during infancy, 31 children of 101 (39%) were hospitalized for respiratory distress and 16 of them had viral infection, and they concluded that viral infections are important cause of hospitalization in children with CF. Abman et al. [13] followed 48 infants with CF over a period of 28.8 months (range 5\u201359 months); 18 (30%) infants had been hospitalized 30 times for respiratory distress. Among these 18 children, RSV was detected in 7 infants.",

A temporal link was proposed between viral infections and new pseudomonas infection [14\u201316]. There are currently limited data available to determine the effects of viral infection on the CF lung microbiota. In vitro studies have shown that RSV and influenza virus increase the adherence of pseudomonas to human airway epithelial cells and modulate neutrophilic inflammation [10, 17]. It was also shown that RSV promotes growth of pseudomonas biofilms through modulation of the immune response and pathogen iron metabolism [18], while rhinovirus promotes the free movement of Pseudomonas from biofilms [19]. In contrast to what was believed, a recent study on dynamic interaction between respiratory viruses and the lung microbiota in children recently reported that viral infection had no impact on bacterial diversity [20]. In our cohort, three children in each group were found to have new Pseudomonas infection in follow-up, which suggests that viral infection may not be the only factor involved in colonization of Pseudomonas in airway epithelium of CF children.",

The majority of studies had shown declining trend of FEV1 and FVC in long-term follow-up in those CF patients who had virus-associated lower respiratory tract infection [7, 21, 22]. Some studies like that by Ramsey et al. [8] showed no effect on pulmonary function tests (Vital Capacity (VC) or Residual volume (RV)/Total Lung Capacity (TLC)) in the follow-up of children with CF after viral infection. A recent review on clinical impact of respiratory viruses in CF suggests that high burden of viral respiratory infection in children with CF is likely to be linked with progression of CF lung disease [23]. In our cohort, both the groups had shown decrement of lung function tests over the follow-up period with more decrement in Group 1, though statistically not significant. It suggests that lung disease progresses over the period of time in these patients irrespective of viral infection.",

Shwachman\u2013Kulczycki (SK) [11] score is the most commonly used score to follow the progression of disease activity in CF children. We reviewed clinical data on general activity, physical examination and nutrition in our cohort. At the baseline, both the groups were comparable in above said three domains. However, at the last visit, children in Group I had poorer scores in the domains of general activity, physical examination and nutrition as compared with Group II suggesting that viral infection may play a role in worsening of clinical status in children with CF. Nevertheless, the subjectivity in the score needs to be kept in mind.",

In our cohort, 87.5% of mortality was constituted by Group I who had viral infection. This can be attributed to the severe pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalization in this group of children. In total, 6 of 18 (33.3%) children who required hospitalization in Group I (CF with viral respiratory infection) died by the end of follow-up period. In a predictive model, CF patients who required hospitalization more than twice a year were 3.5 times more likely to die within 2 years [24]. In a similar survival prediction model comprising data from 5820 CF patients selected from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, each acute pulmonary exacerbation within the first year of follow-up increased the risk of death by 1.5 times in the following 4 years [25]. In a prospective cohort study conducted on 446 adult CF patients, more than two exacerbations per year had a greater risk of lung transplant or death during the study than those with less than one exacerbation per year (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.05) [26]. All of our patients had at least moderate pancreatic insufficiency as suggested by presence of history of frequent, foul-smelling and oily stools. We also note that our patients were malnourished at baseline in both the groups along with low FEV1, which might have contributed to the high mortality in part. Supportive care apart from antibiotics during pulmonary exacerbation plays an important role in the care of CF patients. In our clinic, we do advise and demonstrate regarding chest physiotherapy, inhalation therapy such as hypertonic saline (3% saline) and daily enzyme replacement therapy. However, we do not routinely use DNAse, potentiators or correctors because of cost constraints. We also want to highlight the fact that all of our patients were pancreatic insufficient because patient with milder diseases were not suspected to have CF because of lack of awareness and belief that CF does not occur in Indian children.",
