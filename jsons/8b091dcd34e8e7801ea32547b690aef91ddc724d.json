Recently, transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 were reported to develop pneumonia after SARS-CoV infection. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection in those mice was, however, slightly different from that of human SARS (13, 14) . Human SARS patients generally die from pulmonary failure, whereas infection of the central nervous system is the major factor responsible for a fatal outcome in transgenic mice (13) . In another transgenic model, high replication of SARS-CoV in the brain likely contributed to the deaths (14) . More recently, Roberts et al. (15) reported that a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV causes fatal respiratory disease in young mice, which reproduced many aspects of human SARS.",

These in vitro observations hinted at the highly pathogenic feature of this virus in the lungs, where elastase is predominantly produced as a result of inflammation. In the present study, we examined whether or not SARS-CoV infection is enhanced by weak inflammation in the lungs induced by infection with low-pathogenic bacteria which induce elastase. Our results show that both low-virulent Pp infection, and administration of LPS derived from Escherichia coli, induced elastase in the lungs and enhanced the replication of SARS-CoV, resulting in exacerbation of the respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV infection and a high mortality rate. These results indicate that co-infection of SARS-CoV with low-virulent microorganisms induces exacerbated pneumonia and suggest the possibility that elastase is involved in the pathogenesis of exacerbated pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV infection.",

The possible molecular mechanism of this enhancement is the potentiation of SARS-CoV infection from the cell surface, which is more efficient than the infection via an endosomal pathway which takes place in the absence of proteases (17) . Elastase, a major protease produced in lung inflammation, could enhance SARS-CoV replication in the lungs, which would, in turn, result in severe damage to this organ. We first examined whether infection with Pp induced elastase in the lungs. Pp is of low virulence and, as a rule, causes only mild, never severe, respiratory disease in adult mice (21) . Six-week-old BALB/c mice were infected i.n. with 2.0 \u00d7 10 7 c.f.u. of Pp, and elastase activity in both lung homogenates and BAL was monitored. At one day p.i., significant amounts of elastase were detected in the BAL and lungs of Pp-infected mice, while elastase activity was undetectable in samples from uninfected mice (Fig. 1a) . We also examined the effect of LPS administration on elastase production in the lungs, since LPS has been used as an elastase inducer (22) . Mice administered i.n. with 20 \u03bcl of LPS (1 mg/ml) dissolved in PBS were shown to produce elastase in the lungs one to two days after administration, similar to infection with Pp (Fig. 1b) . These results show that Pp and LPS are appropriate agents for inducing elastase in the lungs and BAL.",

Those mice were infected under conditions identical to those shown in Figure 2 . When examined on days two and four p.i., Fr-mo had grown at a rate 10to 50-fold higher in the lungs of mice than had Fr-1, (Fig. 3a and b) , showing that Fr-mo has a higher potential to grow in mice. On day two p.i. virus titers in the lungs were about 100-fold higher in mice infected with Pp and Fr-1 than in mice infected with Fr-1 alone. However, by the fourth day p.i., there was not a significant difference between the two groups (Fig. 3a) . On day two p.i. the virus titers of mice infected with Pp + Fr-mo were slightly, but significantly higher than those of mice infected with Fr-mo alone. The difference in virus titers between mice infected with Pp + Fr-mo and those with Fr-mo alone was also evident at four days p.i. (Fig. 3b) . These results show that infection with Pp greatly enhanced the infection of Fr-1, but had a less remarkable effect in the infection of Frmo in the early phase of viral infection. More significant enhancement of Fr-mo infection was observed when mice were infected with low titers of virus. When mice were infected with 1 \u00d7 10 4 or 1 \u00d7 10 2 p.f.u., the virus titers were about 10-fold higher in mice co-infected with Pp + Fr-mo than in those infected with Fr-mo alone on both two and four days p.i.

As shown in Figure 4 , the lung elastase activity of mice infected with Pp was significantly higher than that in mice not infected with Pp, when they were examined on day two, but not on day four, after SARS-CoV infection. It was also clear that neither Fr-1 nor Fr-mo elicited elastase by themselves. These data, together with the findings from virus titers in the lungs shown in Figures 3a and b , indicate the possibility that elastase produced in the lungs following Pp infection efficiently (about 100-fold) enhanced Fr-1 infection, and not so efficiently (less than 10-fold), but still significantly enhanced, Fr-mo infection. However, the slightly higher titers found four days p.i. in the lungs of mice infected with Pp + Fr-mo could not be explained by the direct influence of elastase on Fr-mo infection in the lungs. An important condition for sustaining high titers beyond four days p.i. would be that of high replication in the lungs in an early phase of infection, which could be facilitated by elastase induced by Pp. These data suggest that severe respiratory disease caused by co-infection of Pp and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV is attributable to the high replication of virus in the lungs, for which the elastase produced by Pp infection is probably responsible. Development of severe pneumonia in infected mice was not due to high growth of Pp in the lungs, since almost no bacteria were detected in mice co-infected with Pp and SARS-CoV on day four of Pp infection. This was similar to the findings after infection with Pp alone. We have also examined infectious virus titers in various organs other than the lungs. The blood, liver, spleen, heart, intestines and brain from mice doubly infected with Pp + Fr-mo, contained infectious viruses not significantly higher than 10 3 p.f.u./50 mg tissues, indicating that Fr-mo failed to grow in organs other than the lungs.",

Viral antigens were detected in the cytoplasm of type 1 and 2 respiratory epithelial cells, as well as in exfoliative broncho-epithelial cells in alveolar cavities (Fig. 6c) . Co-infected mice that died on days four to six displayed diffuse alveolar damage, such as severe congestion, diffuse exudation of hyaline substance into alveolar cavities, low inflammatory cell infiltration and type 2 respiratory epithelial cell activation (Fig. 6d, e) , all of which was reminiscent of that seen in cases of ARDS reported following autopsy of victims of the latest SARS epidemic (23, 24) .

They also show that the diseases caused by this viral infection were asymptomatic, and that only transient replication of virus took place in the lungs of the mice. Also, with a few exceptions, many other species of animals shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection did not develop an exacerbated respiratory disease (27) (28) (29) . The present study showed that we could induce a severe respiratory disease in mice resembling that found in humans with SARS-CoV infection. Mice co-infected with low-virulent respiratory bacterium Pp and SARS-CoV developed severe pneumonia and more than 35% of infected mice died. The present study indicates that two conditions are critical for the establishment of severe disease, both of which were documented to be important for development of SARS. One is the enhancement of SARS-CoV infection by proteases produced by the host cells (17) . The other is the evolution of SARS-CoV to an extent that it can become highly infectious and pathogenic to a given species of animals to which SARS-CoV is adapted (15, 19, 30, 31) . When these two conditions are fulfilled, severe respiratory disease can be reproduced.",

The mouseadapted virus has several genetic mutations accompanying the amino acid mutations not only in the S but also M, ORF1a and 1b genes. Recombinant viruses containing mutations in the S and M alone or those containing mutations in ORF1a and 1b alone were not highly virulent, but viruses with mutations in all of those genes showed a high virulence, indicating that the virulence of SARS-CoV is determined by multiple genes. Similar observations were reported from Weiss's laboratory for MHV infection. They reported that S is a major determinant of the neurovirulence of MHV-JHM strain, but that genes outside the S are also involved in virulence (31, 32) . Mouse-adapted Fr-mo used in the present study has amino acid changes in the S as well as in ORF1a and 1b as compared with the nonvirulent Fr-1 strain. Although analysis using recombinant viruses has not yet been done, our result is in good agreement with the observation by Roberts et al. in terms of the involvement of the multi-genes in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV.",

As has been elucidated in cultured cells by Matsuyama et al. (17) , elastase could enhance SARS-CoV replication in the lung. Alternatively, elastase could be involved in the development of severe respiratory disease via its pathophysiological functions, such as proteolytic activity, enhancement of blood vessel permeability and induction of proinflammatory cytokine secretion (22) . These activities of elastase produced in the lungs are reported to be responsible for acute lung injury (22) . However, elastase alone is not responsible for the severe respiratory disease described in the present study, since mice infected with Pp alone did not develop severe respiratory disease, although it induced as much elastase production as did Pp + Frmo infection. Thus, extensive infection of SARS-CoV in the lungs could contribute to the development of severe respiratory disease. Studies using elastase inhibitors and anti-elastase antibodies are now in progress to see whether elastase is involved in the pathogenesis of SARS.",
