Hence, declining cognitive ability and increasing physical impairments will have negative effects on their health literacy. The above weaknesses are evident in our findings shown in Table 1. The above is also consistent with our findings in Table 2, in which a majority (63.28%) of the participants had an inadequate level of health literacy and a sizable group (22.17%) had a problematic level of health literacy. In view of the above observations, it is advisable to strengthen the health literacy of the older adults so as to better protect them against infectious diseases.",

On the other hand, those with higher education and income are inclined to consult more external independent sources such as health professionals, the internet, and newspapers. Our findings that most of the participants had little or no primary education may have been a key contributing factor to the high percentage of low health literate participants in this study (85.45%). They knew what to do for proper hand hygiene but did not consistently practice it and had difficulty in understanding health information sufficiently to make informed decisions due to low health literacy. Under these circumstances, the participants were unable to clearly identify or handle certain health information confidently, causing them to have difficulties in interpreting, judging, and evaluating health-related information. This observation is in sync with that of another study which explained that there was a lack of proper health information and that old adults were unaware of the types of vaccination recommended to them.15 This calls for simplified and standardized health information which could more effectively improve old people's health literacy.",

These findings are consistent with Manning 2011\u2019s study14 which showed that the regular use of hand sanitizer remained significantly lower than during the flu pandemic in 2009. During SARS, hand hygiene practices could be attributed to people's raised awareness by the ubiquitous promotion of proper hand hygiene techniques in handling communicable diseases through various media in Hong Kong during that period. Ever since SARS, the Hong Kong Government has stepped up territory-wide health education and promotion to maintain proper hand hygiene practices among health care workers and the general public, for example, education materials like banners and DVDs on hand hygiene have been delivered to the public, private hospitals, and clinics.16 However, the awareness seems to have tapered off. More than 50% of the participants did not carry out proper hand hygiene practices, thus rendering them more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Proper hand hygiene has been shown to significantly reduce the spread of common cold and flu, especially in the older adults. As shown in Q6 of Table 1, 63% of the participants were unsatisfactory in using liquid soap to wash their hands. This means the participants had lower protection against infectious diseases; as shown in previous studies nonantibacterial soap combined with hand-hygiene education could have the strongest protective effect against gastrointestinal illnesses.9 So, it is necessary to encourage old adults to form the habits of using soap to wash hands to safeguard themselves against such illnesses. One plausible suggestion from these findings is that the government can initiate and support frequent proper hand hygiene training for the older adults as a short-term measure against infectious diseases, especially at the homes for the aged.",

On the other hand, if the questions contained complicated messages involving decision making, second opinion seeking, or mental health related, the participants would regard the questions as relatively difficult. This observation has a health policy implication in the enhancement of the older adults\u2019 health literacy. Instead of investing huge sums of money to improve their health literacy, it is more worthwhile and cost effective to invest in simplifying and standardizing health information to enhance old adults\u2019 comprehension. This observation was similar to the results of Stevens's study,17 which pointed out that a good understanding of the learning capacity of old adults has direct, practical implications for professionals trying to educate old people about health care services and benefits. Another study also suggested that the health literacy of old adults will greatly improve if familiar examples built on individuals\u2019 previous life experiences are used.18 Besides, using video or audio (rather than textual) health information can also enhance our older adults\u2019 heath literacy since most of our participants came from the lower income group and had no formal or only primary education.",

The effect, however, was only short term and has not sustained. As shown by our findings, a significant and positive relationship existed between the health literacy and hand hygiene practices of the participants. Indeed, the initial rapid spread of SARS in Hong Kong in 2003 was due to people's improper hand hygiene practices and their low-health literacy.
