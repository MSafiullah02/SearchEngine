            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a typical enveloped negative-strand RNA virus that belongs to the Orthomyxovirida family. Its genome consists of eight RNA fragments, two of which encode two important surface glycoproteins called hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). According to its antigenicity, this virus can be divided into 18 HA subtypes (H1~H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1~N11). At present, some of the combination between different HA subtypes and NA subtypes have been detected [1]. Depending on the virus strain, different IAVs have different pathogenesis for the infection. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) cause mild respiratory symptoms and are sometimes accompanied with a gastrointestinal infection. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), including H5N1 and H7N9, can cause multi-organ systemic infection and even fatal diseases [2]. The main clinical feature of these cases is the different degrees of pneumonia manifesting as fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing.",

However, studies on this issue during the influenza virus infection are limited. A case reported that a 3-year-old boy infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus died of Reye's syndrome and respiratory distress syndrome [5]. A novel pandemic 2009 influenza A \u2044 H1N1 different from the seasonal influenza infection induced hepatocellular injury with increased serum aminotransaminase levels [6,7]. When humans are infected with H7N9, hypoxic and fatty changes in the liver tissue have been observed [8,9]. Moreover, in advanced chronic liver disease, diseases caused by the common bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae or influenza virus increased the risk for serious health complications and death [10]. These data are interesting because liver damage occurs after influenza infection, but no viral pathogen is detected.",

That respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other mucosal tissues have experienced viral replication or immune damage, but do not influence non-mucosal organs, such as the liver or kidney [[11], [12], [13]]. However, some contradicting findings were obtained, such that a pandemic A \u2044 H1N1 (2009) influenza A virus, which is different from seasonal influenza, can lead to liver damage [14]. An abrupt and massive increase in aminotransferase levels is the first direct evidence of liver injury [[15], [16], [17]]. Unexpectedly, we observed that the three subtypes of respiratory influenza infection in mice caused not only damage in the lungs but also in the liver accompanied with clear upregulation of AST in serum. Given that these symptoms resembles those exhibited by humans after influenza infection, our influenza virus infected mice provided a good model for studying the underlying mechanisms of how respiratory influenza infection causes liver damage.",

Liver injury associated with influenza virus infection is uncommon. In case of influenza with accompanying liver damage, no direct evidence is available for viral replication in liver. Therefore, the means for associating influenza infection with damage to tissues or organs is still unclear when these injuries are not induced by direct viral infection. After respiratory A/Kawasaki/86 (H1N1) virus infection, the C57BL/6 (B6) mice displayed \u201ccollateral damage\u201d in liver without viral replication. Further study found that Kupffer cells and apoptotic hepatocytes mediated inflammatory injury [18]. Hypoxic hepatitis was a clinical characteristic in the H7N9 infection [9]. Recent data further confirmed that hypoxic hepatitis can be an important causative factor for acute liver failure associated with influenza virus infection instead of virus related hepatitis [19]. We know that highly pathogenic influenza virus leads to respiratory failure, which reduces the oxygen supply to the liver, and hypoxic hepatitis is a likely cause of severe liver impairment in our study. In our study, viral antigens were widely distributed in the liver of the different influenza virus subtype-infected mice during the infection stage, especially the H5N1- infected group. As expected, a certain relationship exists between the degree of pathological injury in liver (revealed by HE) and the viral load in liver (detected by qRT-PCR). In this work, we conclude that the virus existing in the liver probably induced pathological injury. However, the underlying mechanisms need further investigation.",

The majority of LPAIV, which contain a single arginine (R) or rarely include a lysine (K) at the HA cleavage site, usually cause a local infection. By contrast, the HPAIV of subtypes H5 and H7 possesses the consensus sequence R-X-R/K-R, which supports systemic infections [20]. In this study, among the three virus subtypes, H1N1 and H5N1 caused a high viral load in liver on the basis of the qPCR results. By contrast, H7N2 was a low pathogenic virus that caused a very small amount of virus in the liver. The results of the histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses further showed that pathological damage was present in the same data. However, only H5N1 virus possesses the R-K-K-R amino acid sequence at the cleavage site. The different levels of liver injury caused by influenza infection in this research were independent from the viral HA genes. Thus, a large scale study should be performed to determine the contribution of respiratory influenza virus inducing hepatic tropism and deduce the correlation between them.",

Our data were similar to those of a previous research wherein respiratory infection induced mild liver damage and was self-limiting. However, the underlying mechanism needs further exploration. In summary, our present data suggested that respiratory influenza A virus infection induced liver injury and likely contributed to the viral replication in the liver.
