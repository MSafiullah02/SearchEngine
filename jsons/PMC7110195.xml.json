It is thought that this factor must be \u2018interferon\u2019, which was found as a result of a study about interference against viruses by Drs Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann in 1957 (2). Expression of the genes for type I and type III interferons is massively induced in response to viral infection, and the produced interferons evoke anti-viral activities through their binding to specific receptor complexes to induce multiple interferon-stimulated genes. With the remarkable progress in the studies of innate immunity, much more attention was paid to interferons. Molecular sensor-mediated recognition of invading microbes is the first step of host defense against infection to activate the innate immune system. During viral infection, virus-associated molecular patterns\u2014viral nucleic acids (RNA and DNA)\u2014are mainly targeted by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including transmembrane-type sensors, such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR9, and cytoplasmic sensors, such as RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I; also called DDX58) and cGAS (cyclic GMP\u2013AMP synthetase). In most cases, these viral sensors trigger the gene expression of type I and III interferons to induce anti-viral activities.",

RNA carrying a 5\u2032-triphosphate modification (3pRNA) is an essential determinant for RIG-I recognition (15). Ligand binding activates the ATPase activity to change the conformation of RIG-I. And then oligomerized RIG-I interacts with the mitochondria-associated adaptor protein, MAVS (also known as VISA, IPS-1 or Cardif), through its CARD domains, which is facilitated by both covalent and non-covalent interactions with K63-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains. This, in turn, culminates in activation of transcription factors such as IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB, leading to the activation of the downstream gene induction programs such as type I interferon induction (16).",

The 5\u2032-epsilon region of HBV pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), which is known to take a unique hairpin structure, is a target for the RIG-I-mediated sensing. In this case, type III interferons were predominantly induced in vitro and in vivo during infection with HBV genotypes A, B and C, in a RIG-I-dependent manner. In general, RIG-I signaling leads to both type I and type III interferon gene induction, but how this predominant induction of type III interferons during HBV infection occurs remains to be clarified. Since such type III interferon dominancy was also observed during HCV infection and upon treatment with a RIG-I ligand 3pRNA, human hepatocytes seem to have their own intrinsic mechanism to preferentially produce type III interferons. In relation to this, there is an interesting report showing that, in human nasal epithelial cells, type III interferons but not type I interferons are predominantly induced in response to several RNA viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), MeV and mumps virus (MuV) (18).",

In addition to the conventional role of RLRs as an RNA sensor inducing innate anti-viral signaling, these findings provide a novel aspect of RLR-mediated anti-viral activity, whereby RLRs act as direct anti-viral effectors against viral infection by counteracting a dsRNA-binding viral protein-mediated evasion mechanism (see later).",

This was supported by subsequent studies, showing that DAI has a role in type I interferon induction in human foreskin fibroblasts upon cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (32, 33), although DAI does not seem to be essentially involved in DNA sensing in vivo (34). Subsequently, it was reported that the cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I was involved in the induction of the type I interferon response during DNA virus infection. AT-rich dsDNA is transcribed by host RNA polymerase III (RNA pol III) into 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA, which becomes a RIG-I ligand to initiate the RIG-I pathway (35, 36).

Subsequently, cGAMP functions as an endogenous second messenger, and binds to STING protein to induce innate immune responses such as interferon responses (46). In addition, cGAS senses not only pathogen-derived DNA but also aberrantly accumulated self-DNA in the cytosol, and also has important roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, inflammation, cellular senescence and cancer (47\u201349). On the other hand, IFI16 was also identified as an intracellular DNA sensor that mediates the induction of IFN-\u03b2 (44). IFI16 directly interacts with viral DNAs and activates its downstream signaling via STING (44).

TRIM25 is required for RIG-I oligomerization and interaction with the adaptor MAVS, whereas Riplet/RNF135 is required for the release of RIG-I autorepression of its N-terminal CARDs, which enables RIG-I to interact with TRIM25 (70). Another RNA-binding E3 Ub ligase, MEX3C/RNF193, colocalizes with RIG-I in the stress granules (SGs) of virally infected cells, and mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of the CARDs of RIG-I for its activation (71).",

Thus, RIG-I activation is regulated by both covalent and non-covalent interactions with K63-linked Ub chains. Intriguingly, the role of this K63-linked polyubiquitin for RIG-I activation can be substituted with interferon-inducible oligoadenylate synthetases-like (OASL) protein, which lacks 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase activity but contains two tandem Ub-like domains (UBL) in the C terminus.

Whereas AHR has been mostly studied in terms of its toxic effects on development, cell proliferation and immune responses, but a variety of endogenous metabolites have also been shown to interact with the receptor and are involved in the regulation of multiple biological events (91\u201393). In this respect, treatment with an AHR antagonist CH-223191 enhanced the interferon response upon viral infection and 3pRNA stimulation, suggesting that constitutive AHR signaling activated by endogenous ligand(s), such as kynurenine, negatively modulates the type I interferon anti-viral response to prevent excessive responses. These findings indicate that this negative regulation is based upon the post-translational ADP-ribosylation of the TBK1 protein mediated by AHR-induced TIPARP (90). An endogenous AHR ligand, kynurenine, is synthesized via oxidation of tryptophan, which is catalyzed by tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1/2 (IDO1/2). Liver is one of the major places where this enzymatic process takes place by using TDO, which is known to be exclusively expressed at high levels in human liver (94). On the other hand, the liver has large populations of specialized tissue macrophages (namely Kupffer cells) and DCs (95, 96), which have pivotal roles in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immune responses and its subsequent adaptive immune responses. Therefore, it is important to regulate such innate signaling-based responses to maintain immune homeostasis in liver.",

Some of the lncRNAs have been implicated as a new class of regulators in innate signaling (Fig. 2c) (108). Very recently, lnc-Lsm3b, a non-coding alternatively processed isoform of the protein-coding gene Lsm3, was shown to be induced by type I interferons and to inactivate RIG-I function at a late stage of the innate response (109). This study provides a novel lncRNA-mediated negative feedback regulation of innate signaling to prevent detrimental, excessive inflammatory responses, wherein the self-lncRNA lnc-Lsm3b functions as a molecular decoy to occupy the RIG-I-binding sites and sequester RIG-I molecules to restrict the access of \u2018non-self\u2019 RNA. Interestingly, lnc-Lsm3b uses GA-rich motifs located at the incomplete pairing strand of the long stem structure to efficiently compete with non-self-viral RNA. lnc-Lsm3b contains a multitude of GA-rich motifs, compared to RIG-I-favored foreign ligands that contain specific sequences, such as polyU/UC motifs or elements in viral genomes. Further structural analyses would reveal its detailed mechanism for the competition and how such RIG-I recognition of self-RNA stops the generation of the downstream signaling. A 5\u2032-triphosphate modification does not seem to be needed for lnc-Lsm3b to bind RIG-I.",

In this case, its binding confers a conformational change to promote MDA5 oligomerization and its downstream signaling. This lncRNA was studied particularly in terms of its role in anti-viral responses against HCV infection.

In addition, HIV-1 protease (PR) targets RIG-I through the degradation of RIG-I, which is dependent on lysosomes but not proteasomes (131). PR does not directly cleave RIG-I, but redirects RIG-I to the lysosomal compartment for its degradation. Blockade of sensor activation and/or innate signaling modulates the innate responses and attenuates anti-viral defense, which may allow viral persistence. Therefore, it is an important therapeutic strategy to target the host\u2013virus interaction involved in innate immune evasion for the efficient activation of anti-viral innate signaling against viral infection.",

During viral infection, virus-derived nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are mainly targeted by host nucleic acid sensors triggering the gene expression of type I and III interferons to induce anti-viral activities. As RNA sensors, TLR3 and TLR7/TLR8 sense viral RNAs on the endosomal or lysosomal membrane. RIG-I and MDA5 are ubiquitously expressed and recognize viral RNAs in the cytoplasmic space. Other RNA helicases DDX1, DDX21 and DHX36 form an RNA sensor complex in mDCs. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) NOD2 also detects the RSV-derived ssRNA genome to activate the MAVS/IPS-1 pathway. In the cases of DNA sensing, TLR9 detects DNA containing the unmethylated CpG motif. DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1) interacts with dsDNA and activates TBK1 and IRF-3 as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor. Cytoplasmic AT-rich dsDNA (B-DNA) is transcribed by host RNA polymerase III (RNA pol III) into 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA (3pRNA), which becomes a RIG-I ligand. DHX36 and DHX9 intracellularly sense CpG class A and B, respectively, in mDCs. DNA-stimulated DDX41 and the ALR IFI16 interact with their adaptor protein STING. STING itself also serves as a sensor of CDNs such as bacterium-derived c-di-GMP as well as host-derived cGAMP generated by cGAS in response to microbe- and host-derived cytosolic DNAs. cGAS is a critical cytoplasmic sensor for the detection of both microbial and host DNAs. The cGAS\u2013cGAMP\u2013STING pathway is now recognized as a major intracellular dsDNA sensing pathway. DNA-PK, Ku70 and extrachromosomal histone H2B are also reported to function as cytosolic DNA sensors. As for Ku70, only type III interferon is induced. LRRFIP1 functions possibly as a cytosolic nucleic acid sensor that dually detects both RNA and DNA. HMGBs also bind to both double-stranded and single-stranded immunogenic RNAs and function as universal sensors for nucleic acid-mediated innate immune responses during viral infection.",

            "text": "Fig. 2.: Regulatory mechanisms of RIG-I activation and its signaling. (a) Ubiquitination-based regulatory mechanisms. The RING-finger E3 Ub ligase TRIM25 positively mediates the RIG-I pathway by its K63-linked ubiquitination of the N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I. Riplet/RNF135 promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of the C-terminal region of RIG-I. MEX3C/RNF193 mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of the CARDs of RIG-I for its activation. Caspase-12 is physically associated with RIG-I and up-regulates TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I, leading to the enhancement of type I interferon responses. Non-covalent binding of K63-Ubn to the RIG-I CARDs induces its tetramer formation for downstream signal activation. Ube2D3/Ubc5c and Ube2N/Ubc13 were also identified as essential Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2) for RIG-I activation. The Ube2D3/Ubc5c\u2013Riplet pair promotes covalent conjugation of polyubiquitin chains to RIG-I, whereas Ube2N/Ubc13 preferentially facilitates production of unanchored polyubiquitin chains. On the contrary, K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I by other E3 Ub ligases, such as c-Cbl/RNF55, RNF122, RNF125, CHIP and TRIM40, negatively regulates anti-viral innate responses. (b) Phosphorylation-based regulatory mechanisms. DAPK1 interacts with RIG-I and directly phosphorylates its threonine (T) 667 to impair its RNA ligand binding and abolishes anti-viral signaling. DAPK1 and PKC-\u03b1/\u03b2 phosphorylate the N-terminal serine(S) at position 8 of RIG-I to suppress TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. CK2 is responsible for this regulation, and constitutively phosphorylates T770 and S854 to S855 residues in the RIG-I CTD, which keeps a closed, inactivated conformation. (c) Other RIG-I-interacting factors and lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms. OASL interacts with RIG-I and mimics polyubiquitin through the UBL domains to enhance RIG-I-mediated anti-viral signaling. ISG15-mediated ISGylation of RIG-I reduces the cellular level of active RIG-I and suppresses its downstream anti-viral innate responses. ZAPS, which is a shorter form of PARP-13, functions as a potent stimulator of RIG-I-mediated anti-viral signaling through its interaction with RIG-I to facilitate RIG-I oligomerization and its ATPase activity for the activation of both IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB. PACT directly interacts with the CTD of RIG-I to potentiate the activation of RIG-I. DDX6 interacts with RIG-I and augments type I interferon gene induction.",

Constitutive AHR signaling activated by endogenous ligand(s), such as kynurenine, negatively modulates the type I interferon anti-viral response to prevent excessive responses. On the other hand, in the gut, some tryptophan metabolites such as kynurenine, IAld and I3S are generated by the bacterial catabolism of tryptophan, and act as AHR ligands to induce regulatory responses for the maintenance and function of ILC3 cells and the control of Treg and Th17 differentiation.",
