            "text": "Thousands of lncRNAs are pervasively transcribed in mammalian cells. Accumulating data indicate that they are an important class of regulatory RNAs in a variety of cellular processes (Mercer et al., 2009). To serve the function of signaling, decoying, scaffolding, or guiding, lncRNAs employ their motifs to interact with other molecules (Guttman and Rinn, 2012, Wang and Chang, 2011). Most recently, three lncRNAs (murine NeST, human THRIL, and NEAT1) are shown to regulate the innate immunity by modulating the transcription of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL8, respectively (Cullen, 2013, Gomez et al., 2013, Imamura et al., 2014, Li et al., 2014). In addition, mouse lincRNA-Cox2 plays a central role in control of the Pam3CSK4-induced inflammatory response (Carpenter et al., 2013). Whole transcriptome studies have also demonstrated the differential expression of lncRNAs in SARS coronavirus-infected mice (Peng et al., 2010) and enterovirus 71-infected RD cells (Yin et al., 2013), suggesting the functional involvement of lncRNAs in antiviral immunity. Interestingly, several lncRNAs have been shown to modulate viral infection. For example, 7SL and NEAT1 are evidenced to interfere with the HIV-1 virion package and posttranscriptional expression (Wang et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2013). lncRNA VIN can facilitate influenza A virus (IAV) propagation (Winterling et al., 2014). Despite these progresses, the specific functions of these lncRNAs in the host defense process remain incompletely characterized.",

            "text": "IAV infection poses a significant threat to global health (M\u00e4nz et al., 2013), but the mechanisms underlying IAV-host interaction are still elusive. Host anti-IAV response is initiated by the recognition of viral components by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation factor 5 (MDA5), and toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Through the signaling cascade downstream the stimulated receptors, transcription factors including IRF3/7 and NF-\u03baB are activated. Type I and III interferons (IFNs) are then rapidly produced, which induce the synthesis of hundreds of antiviral proteins encoded by IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consequently, the accumulation of ISG proteins in cytosol, including the well-known IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats IFIT2, IFIT3 (Fensterl et al., 2012, Liu et al., 2011), IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) (Everitt et al., 2012), and myxovirus resistance 1 (human MxA or mouse Mx1) (M\u00e4nz et al., 2013), provides antiviral protection through multiple mechanisms. Importantly, modulation of anti-IAV immunity epigenetically has emerged to be a critical mechanism. After the activation of transcription factors, a transcriptional regulation cascade is triggered (Smale, 2012). The cascade includes multiple waves of transcriptional activation and inhibition controlled by a complex network. First of all, regulations of promoter activity and chromatin structure are essential steps for the transcription initiation. For example, the activation of the promoters of immune genes ifit2, ifit3, and mx1 requires nucleosome remodeling through SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) complexes and histone modifications (H3K4me3 or H3K9/K14ac) (Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2009). IFN-\u03b3 promoter is reported to be upregulated by lncRNA NeST, which binds with H3K4 methylase complex component WDR5 to alter histone methylation levels (Gomez et al., 2013). In addition, the mRNA maturation and stabilization are also critical posttranscriptional regulation steps. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) regulate gene transcription and subsequent modification of the newly synthesized RNA (pre-mRNA) in nucleus. Recent studies have shown that hnRNP L and hnRNP A/B are associated with the induction of immunity genes TNF-\u03b1 and CCL5 through interaction with lncRNA THRIL and lincRNA-Cox2, respectively (Carpenter et al., 2013, Li et al., 2014). These data suggest that additional coregulators are required for transcriptional activation/inhibition of innate immunity genes.",

The human lncRNA gene nrav (LOC100506668, uc001tyk, also named as dynll1-as1) is located on chromosome 12q24.31, overlapping with the antisense strand of dynein light chain coding gene dynll1 within intron 1 (Figure 1B). No protein-coding potential was found in NRAV by analysis using ORF Finder (NCBI), coding potential calculator (score is \u22120.743) (Figure S1C), and PhyloCSF (score is \u22123452) (Lin et al., 2011). Using polysome analysis, we further observed that NRAV displayed different distribution patterns in sucrose gradient fractions as compared with control protein-coding mRNA of GAPDH that locates in the same fractions as polysome, demonstrating the noncoding potential of NRAV (Figures S1D and S1E). Importantly, both qRT-PCR and northern blotting confirmed that NRAV expression was markedly reduced in IAV-infected A549 cells (Figures 1C and 1D). Northern blot analysis using a specific probe (793 nt) demonstrated that the major form of human NRAV was the transcript of approximately 1,200 nt (Figure 1D). Consistently, determination of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of NRAV by RACE studies revealed that NRAV transcript is exactly 1,176 nt and contains a polyadenylated (12 As) tail (Figures 1E and S1F; Table S1).",

Interestingly, NRAV was expressed in various human cell lines, and its expression was dramatically reduced after IAV infection in all examined cell lines susceptible to the infection, but not in cell lines (HeLa, HepG2) less permissive to IAV replication (Figure 1G). Surprisingly, NRAV was also significantly downregulated by infections of several other viruses, including a negative ssRNA virus Sendai virus (SeV), a dsRNA virus Muscovy Duck Reovirus (MDRV), and a DNA virus herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Figures 1H and 1I). In contrast, NRAV levels were not affected by pseudovirus transduction, LPS treatment, etoposide stimulation, or serum withdrawal (Figures S1G\u2013S1J). Together, these experiments demonstrate that reduction of NRAV level is associated with viral infection.",

Although IAV infection reduced the endogenous NRAV expression, it had no significant effects on the ectopically expressed NRAV and could not diminish the difference of NRAV expression between sh-Luc control cells and NRAV knockdown cells (Figure 2B). Strikingly, both the virus growth kinetics measured by haemagglutination assay and the virus titers determined by plaque-forming test showed that forced expression of NRAV significantly promoted the viral replication, while disruption of NRAV expression consistently impaired the virus reproduction in A549 cells (Figures 2C\u20132E). The sh-NRAV-1 cells with lower NRAV expression were used in further studies. Similar results were obtained from NRAV overexpression and knockdown in 293T cells (Figure S2C). The increased virus titers in supernatant from NRAV-overexpressing cells were further confirmed by western blotting using an antibody against the IAV hemagglutinin (HA) (Figures S2D and S2E). Because IAV infection caused a marked decrease in NRAV expression in A549 cells, we determined whether NRAV levels in NRAV-knockdown cells were lower than those in the control cells during IAV infection. Indeed, the knockdown cells showed clearly low levels of NRAV compared with the controls (Figure 2F). However, the DYNLL1 levels were not affected by altered expression of NRAV, and therefore NRAV functions unlikely through a cis-effect on DYNLL1 (Figures S2F and S2G). These data suggest that lncRNA NRAV is involved in regulating IAV replication, and downregulation of NRAV in infected cells might be a host self-protection response to the virus infection, which may be critical to viral clearance.",

The TG mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were intranasally inoculated with WSN virus, and the influence of NRAV on the virulence and infection kinetics was analyzed. As expected, the IAV showed a considerably higher virulence in TG mice than that in WT mice. Under our experimental condition, body weight loss of infected TG mice was observed on day 4 postinfection (dpi) (Figure 3B). By 5\u20139 dpi, infected TG mice exhibited a consistent decrease in body weight, and with an average loss of approximately 25% on 8 dpi. All infected TG mice died within 9 dpi (Figure 3C). Under the same conditions, however, inoculated WT littermates started body weight loss on 5 dpi, with an average loss of approximately 8% on 8 dpi, and only approximately 40% of infected WT mice succumbed within 9 dpi (Figure 3C). Approximately 60% infected WT mice gained body weight gradually after 8 dpi and finally survived.",

Surprisingly, we identified 107 ISGs from differentially expressed genes in NRAV-overexpressing cells, and strikingly, the enrichment score of these ISGs was significantly high (21.3) using the analysis with interferome (Rusinova et al., 2013) (Table S2). Since ISGs are important antiviral effectors, we focused specifically on the ISG genes for further studies. Importantly, mRNA levels of some critical ISGs were significantly reduced in NRAV-overexpressing cells, including IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM3, OASL, and MxA (Figure 4A, right). This finding was further confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 4B). In contrast, the mRNA levels of these ISGs were upregulated in NRAV knockdown cells (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the expression of ISGs regulated by NRAV was examined in IAV-infected NRAV TG mice and WT littermates. Consistently, we found that the levels of these ISGs in TG mice were significantly reduced as compared with those in WT controls after infection with IAV (Figures 4D and 4E).

To this end, exogenous IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM3, or MxA was transiently expressed in the cell lines overexpressing NRAV or empty vector (EV) (Figure S3C). Indeed, forced expression of IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM3, or MxA reversed the effect of NRAV on the IAV replication despite existence of excessive NRAV, whereas expression of control DDX3X, a component of TBK1-dependent innate immune response, had no such a function (Figures S3D and S3E). Because previous studies have shown that MxA interacts with IAV protein NP to inhibit the viral transcription (M\u00e4nz et al., 2013), we tested whether NRAV knockdown had any effects on IAV cRNA levels. Indeed, we found that the cRNA levels were clearly low in NRAV-depleted cells compared to the control at 8 hpi (Figure S3F), suggesting that the increased MxA caused by NRAV downregulation may block IAV transcription. However, altering NRAV expression has no significant effect on viral entry at early stage of viral infection (4 hr) (Figure S3G). These results suggest that lncRNA NRAV is critically involved in regulation of innate immune response via controlling the levels of several critical ISGs during the viral infection.",

To this end, we determined the cellular localization of NRAV and found that although NRAV was localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, more NRAV was distributed in the nucleus of A549 cell (Figures 6\nA and S5A). Thus, we presumed that NRAV might be involved in transcriptional control of these ISGs. The pre-mRNA level can represent the initial transcription rate. Therefore, the primers to examine the pre-mRNA levels of MxA (preMxA) and IFITM3 (preIFITM3) were designed as previously described (Zeisel et al., 2011) (Figure 6B). We observed that the preMxA and preIFITM3 levels in infected NRAV-overexpressing cells were lower than those in control (p < 0.05), while no bands were observed in no reverse transcriptase control (Figures 6C\u20136E), indicating that NRAV may regulate the initial transcription of MxA and IFITM3. Furthermore, we observed that the promoter activity of both MxA and IFITM3 was significantly reduced in NRAV-overexpressing cells compared with control cells using a luciferase reporter assay (Figures S5B\u2013S5D). These observations suggest that NRAV may be involved in negative regulation of promoter function of these ISGs.",

As shown in Figure S5E, treatment of A549 cells with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine (DAC) resulted in an increase of MxA mRNA level. However, expression of MxA was still inhibited in the presence of NRAV. In addition, we examined the mRNA decay rate of MxA in the infected cells treated with actinomycin D (ActD), since lncRNAs can activate mRNA decay through recruiting STAU1 to mRNAs (Kretz et al., 2013). No significant difference in the mRNA degradation rates was detected between NRAV-overexpressing cells and control cells (Figures S5F and S5G).

This finding was further confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) showing that the amount of NRAV precipitated with anti-ZONAB Ab was dramatically higher than that of GAPDH control (Figure S6B). We next determined the role of ZONAB in MxA expression. The shRNA-based ZONAB knockdown was performed and verified by qRT-PCR (Figure S6C). Interestingly, the levels of MxA mRNA were significantly decreased after silencing ZONAB in both infected and uninfected cells (Figure 6I). When ZONAB was depleted in NRAV-overexpressing cells, the MxA mRNA was decreased to a lower level (Figure 6J), while NRAV was not affected by altered ZONAB expression (Figure S6D, left). Consistently, the exogenous expression of ZONAB in NRAV-overexpressing cells partially reversed the NRAV-mediated suppression of MxA expression (Figures S6D\u2013S6F).

These findings establish that NRAV functions as an important regulatory molecule via negatively regulating the expression of some crucial antiviral proteins, which modulates the host innate immune response against IAV infection and maybe more broadly involved in other viral infections.",

When virus infection is sensed, the reduction of NRAV would benefit the rapid accumulation of the antiviral proteins to facilitate the clearance of virus. Therefore, downregulation of NRAV may be initiated by host as a self-protection response. This is coherent with the tight and exquisite control of antiviral response that ensures rapid defense against pathogens with minimal inflammatory damage. A number of negative regulators of innate immunity have been found, such as SOCS1 and SOCS3, which negatively regulate IFN-activated JAK-STAT signaling to control the ISG transcriptional response to IFN stimulation (Akhtar and Benveniste, 2011). LincRNA-Cox2 also mediates the repression of some immune genes (Carpenter et al., 2013). Although the mechanism underlying downregulation of NRAV by viral infection remains elusive, the expression of NRAV is likely controlled by particular pathways activated upon sensing the viral infection. Indeed, we found that the NRAV downregulation was induced only by viral RNA which is produced during virus replication (Figures S7A\u2013S7E) and newly synthesized protein(s) (Figure S7F). However, these proteins might include neither virus-induced cytokines nor IFNAR1 (Figures S7G\u2013S7J). We observed that reduction of NRAV was not caused by increase in RNA decay (Figure S7K), indicating that this protein(s) might be relevent with the transcriptional regulation of NRAV. CpG islands and some transcription factor binding sites on the upstream of nrav were predicted (Figure S7L). Interestingly, DNA methyltransferase might participate in the regulation of NRAV (Figures S7M\u2013S7P). These findings suggest that virus infection might induce the transcription inhibition of nrav through epigenetic modification.",

Strikingly, the transcriptional regulations of these genes are distinct, and multiple mechanisms are involved. For example, MxA/Mx1 is regulated through strictly IFN-dependent pathway, while IFIT2 and IFIT3 are through both IFN-dependent and IFN-independent pathways (Lazear et al., 2013). Interestingly, these NRAV-modulated ISGs have recently been reported belonging to a subset of ISGs which are regulated by an IKKi-associated specific signal pathway (Ng et al., 2011, Tenoever et al., 2007). In this study, we found that the initial transcription rates of MxA and IFITM3 were reduced and the histone modifications (active mark H3K4me3 and repressive mark H3K27me3) were altered by NRAV. Several lncRNAs have been reported to regulate chromatin remodeling on specific gene location through directly binding with hnRNPs (Carpenter et al., 2013, Li et al., 2014). Although we have excluded the possibility that NRAV functions through regulating IFN-JAK/STAT1 pathway, the molecular mechanism by which NRAV regulates the initial transcription and histone modifications remains unknown. On the other hand, NRAV was shown to interfere with the MxA and IFITM3 promoter activity in a luciferase reporter system. These data suggest that there might exist multiple mechanisms underlying NRAV-mediated regulation of ISG transcription.",

            "text": "It has been thought that lncRNAs usually interact with other molecules to exert regulatory activities. In this study, ZONAB was identified as a NRAV-associated protein involved in MxA transcription regulation. ZONAB is a multifunctional protein that regulates transcription of cyclin D1 and PCNA as an important transcription factor and posttranscriptionally regulates other protein and mRNA levels in cytoplasm (Lima et al., 2010, Nie et al., 2012). Although it is unclear whether ZONAB functions as a transcription factor of ISG expression, we found a ZONAB binding sequence (invert CCAAT) at \u2212219 to \u2013215 of MxA transcription start region (Dolfini and Mantovani, 2013), suggesting the potential involvement of ZONAB in initial transcription of MxA. Additionally, as a transcription factor ZONAB might also be involved in histone modifications and nucleosome packing (Rothenberg, 2014). It has been thought that ZONAB can upregulate several chromatin remodeling components (histone H4 and HMG-I) and MYC that recruits core histone-modifying enzymes to DNA (Sourisseau et al., 2006). Further experiments are needed in the future to address how ZONAB interacts with NRAV to regulate ISG expression.",

Although Dynein is shown to be recruited by many viruses to facilitate their replication and enhance their spread, and direct interaction of Dynll with virions is identified (Merino-Gracia et al., 2011), we did not observe significant change in the Dynll1 levels after altering the NRAV expression (GEO accession number GSE48874; Figures S2F and S2G). Of interest is that hundreds of genes differentially expressed in NRAV-overexpressing cells and the pathway and GO analysis indicated that many are associated with pathogen infection and viral reproduction. In addition, the expression of NRAV in different types of human cells also indicates its broad functions. The expression of human NRAV in multiple tissues of TG mice including lung, thymus, and bone marrow might be important for the IAV pathogenesis. Therefore, the role of NRAV may be not limited to the modulation of ISGs. Moreover, the decline of NRAV level can also be induced by other RNA/DNA virus infections. Hence, we surmise that NRAV-related cellular response may be a universal defense against virus infection. The exact relationship between NRAV distribution in different tissues and its antiviral activities needs to be determined.",

The fold enrichment was calculated as 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 3). (H) Silver staining of proteins pulled down by NRAV antisense probes or scramble control probes from A549 cell lysate. The specific NRAV-associated band (arrow) was excised for mass spectrometry. Shown are representative data from three independent experiments. (I) MxA mRNA levels in ZONAB-depleted A549 cells infected with or without WSN (moi = 1, 12 hpi) were measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to that of uninfected control cells transfected with vector sh-Luc. (J) Experiments were performed as described in (I). MxA mRNA levels in ZONAB-depleted NRAV-overexpressing A549 cells were measured by qRT-PCR. Data are shown as means \u00b1 SEM; n = 3. \u2217p < 0.05, \u2217\u2217p < 0.01. See also Figures S5\u2013S7 and Table S3.",

The stable exogenous expression of NRAV or its mutants in A549 cells was determined by RT-PCR (right). (C) A549 cells expressing NRAV or its mutants were infected with IAV, and the virus titers in culture supernatants were determined through plaque-forming assay (n = 3; means \u00b1 SEM; \u2217\u2217p < 0.01).
