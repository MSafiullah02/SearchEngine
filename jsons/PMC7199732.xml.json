            "text": "Proteases are a widely explored research topic as illustrated by more than 487 000 entries registered in PUBMED. However, it was only recently that proteases emerged as an analyte of interest for biosensing [68]. These hydrolytic enzymes (EC 3.4) play a pivotal role in several biological processes, such as digestion, cell proliferation, and differentiation [1], as well as apoptosis [2], coagulation [3], immunity [4], and fertility [5]. The deregulation of protease metabolism can result in numerous pathological conditions (i.e., cancers [6], neurodegenerative disorders [7], and others [8]). For this reason, the pharmaceutical industry is actively evaluating the potential of proteases as drug targets or as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. In this regard, thrombin and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can be highlighted as two of the most common protease targets in clinical biochemistry [9,10]. And, one notable example of a protease-targeted therapy is the administration of HIV-1 protease inhibitors (i.e., lopinavir/ritonavir branded as Kaletra from Abbott Laboratories) in the context of AIDS [11]. Lopinavir is a specific inhibitor of HIV proteases, which prevents maturation of the virus, hindering its ability to infect new cells and replicate. However, lopinavir is quickly degraded within the human body by cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) [12]. To overcome this and increase the lifetime of lopinavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (ritonavir) is included in the formulation. During the preparation of this manuscript (March 27, 2020), the world is facing an unprecedented pandemic due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Similar to HIV, proteases are pivotal during viral maturation, affecting the ability of the virus to infect new host cells [13]. Likewise, protease-targeted therapies with protease inhibitors are one of the forefront strategies being pursued to fight the outbreak. Several drugs are undergoing testing and clinical trials (https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/who-launches-global-megatrial-four-most-promising-coronavirus-treatments#), with mild results [14,15], notably lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04252885). In this regard, the ability to monitor proteolytic activity in real-time can play a pivotal role in screening potential protease inhibitors for therapeutic purposes [16]. The spread of COVID-19 caught most countries off-guard, with their health-care systems being unable to restrain transmission before adequate testing to allow controlled isolation and tracking [17]. This may due to the fact that the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 RT-PCR test is time-consuming and expensive, among other limitations (https://www.fda.gov/media/136151/download; https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/how-is-the-covid-19-virus-detected-using-real-time-rt-pcr). Alternative, less expensive and easier to use serological tests also have limitations [17]. Both tests may also provide non-definitive results (https://www.politico.eu/article/spanish-government-under-fire-after-defective-testing-kits-fiasco). Although to our knowledge diagnosis of viral infections by proteolytic activity monitoring is unavailable in health care, experimental studies on viral proteolytic maturation should clarify the potential of proteases as drug targets and as diagnostic tools [18].",

            "text": "In view of its biological and therapeutic relevance, understanding and evaluation of proteolytic activity, both in vitro and in vivo, is extremely informative. However, determining protease concentration in serum, tissues, and other samples without correlation with its activity can give limited or erroneous information due to particular features of these enzymes, as described below. Despite the disadvantages of measuring protease concentration instead of proteolytic activity, this is still performed due to the simple adaptation of gold-standard procedures to these enzymes. The presence of proteases is usually established indirectly by measuring genetic expression via RNA quantification or by using immunoassays. A good example of this approach is the use of reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to infer the presence of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in rheumatoid arthritis [19]. However, in these studies immunosensing and mRNA quantification can be misleading because proteases are naturally synthetized in an inactive pro-form, which is activated post-expression. Unfortunately, most immunoassays cannot distinguish between the two forms and the detection of mRNA cannot be taken as a guarantee of the presence of proteolytic activity. Additionally, enzymes are sensitive to disease-related environmental conditions (e.g., pH is often lower in cancerous cells) and thus genetic expression does not necessarily correlate with activity [20,21]. Also, proteases are characterized by a high catalytic constant (108\u2013109 M\u22121s\u22121), which means that even a very small variation in genetic expression can have a major outcome difference. Finally, these enzymes are often regulated by endogenous inhibitors, such as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs), which are responsible for restraining the activity of MMPs, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) within the homeostatic range [22]. For the reasons mentioned above, concentration is not always correlated with activity. Alternatively, by measuring the proteolytic activity one is directly evaluating the function of the protease at physiological conditions and not merely its presence. This creates several opportunities, as described next.",

Changing the paradigm to real-time detection, where the sensor gives an immediate response proportional to the proteolytic activity, would be extremely interesting in drug development, fundamental studies, and healthcare. From the perspective of the development of protease-targeted drugs/therapies, measuring enzyme kinetics over time using the same sample and without the need for suicidal experiments decreases the number of assays needed for each test [31]. Usually, proteases and pharmaceutical compounds, especially those of clinical relevance, can be expensive and, by decreasing the number of performed tests, the development costs can diminish significantly. Additionally, in assays that determine the concentration of a given analyte, usually one molecule produces one output signal. When measuring enzyme activity, however, a single enzyme can be responsible for multiple events of substrate cleavage thus leading to multiple readout signals, which ultimately produce signal amplification with a concomitant increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).",

In general, real-time proteolytic assays exploit the molecular-ruler principle [32], whereby a sensor molecule is used that contains two labels bridged by the target peptide sequence (Figure 1B). The distance between the two components should change only due to the proteolytic activity of the target protease \u2013 as result of cleavage of the target sequence \u2013 thus producing a signal readout, while in control samples this bridging sequence remains intact and, in this case, no readout is produced. Other real-time sensors, by contrast, explore the fact that the cleavage of the original protein target generates smaller fragments and often induces a change in a given property (impedance, diffusion), which will influence the sensor readings proportionally to the proteolytic activity (Figure 1C).",

In most designs, ET occurs through long-range dipole\u2013dipole interactions [F\u00f6rster mechanism or FRET], in which one entity works as an energy donor and another as an energy acceptor. Herein, the fluorophore properties critically affect the detection limit and the dynamic range of the method; a good fluorophore should possess a high molar absorption coefficient, high quantum yield (QY), chemical and photochemical stability, and, ideally, no or low toxicity [33]. The advantage of organic fluorophores is illustrated by the fact that tailormade proteolytic sensors using cyanine and Atto dyes are commercially available [34]. Furthermore, being molecular-sized entities, these organic dye labels exhibit almost no steric effects, which can be critical in enzymatic assays. Despite these advantages, organic fluorophores, especially near-IR (NIR) dyes, have limiting photophysical properties, such as photobleaching and low QY, which hampers their potential for in vivo applications [34].",

For example, Jeong et al. developed a QD-based ET biosensor in the second NIR region to determine the proteolytic activities of MMP-2 and -9 in real time (Figure 2A) [35]. In this work, a multifunctional peptide was used to bridge a QD to an acceptor that quenches its emission in the absence of MMPs. On breaking the peptide bond, the acceptor is released and the donor brightness increases proportionally to the presence of the active protease. Compared with other NIR dyes, this QD-based sensor displayed better performance for in-depth in vivo imaging. Despite these improvements, the application of QDs in these systems can still be hindered by toxicity, photoblinking phenomena, and size-related issues.",

[36] to detect Caspase-3 and -7 inside cells using an adenocarcinoma (SW 620) cell line. In their design, the authors used a crown nanoparticle assembly comprising a core 40-nm plasmonic gold particle coupled to several gold nanoparticles by a target sequence for caspase detection (Figure 2B). Using this plasmon ruler, the authors were able to optically probe caspase activity by measuring the scattered light from the nanoassembly and to follow cell-signaling pathways in vivo at a single-molecule level during a period of over 2 h (continuous measuring). The crown nanoassemblies were crucial to obtain a good SNR in such a highly scattering environment, because two or more particles display a scattering signal 44\u00d7 greater than individual particles. Additionally, the nanoassembly was functionalized with a cell-penetrating peptide (TAT) allowing intracellular/cytosolic sensing of Caspase-3 and -7 activity in real time. The movement of the particles was minimal during experiments due to constriction from the network of cytoskeleton filaments, although after cleavage the resulting particles were able to freely diffuse away from the region of interest. This system proved to be a powerful tool to determine single proteolytic events in real time inside living cells and allowed the researchers to characterize biochemical parameters, such as time lag, and to determine cell heterogeneity in the same sample. The main disadvantage of the strategy appeared to be the difficulty in preparing the nanocrown systems and their inherent heterogeneity.",

However, most of the strategies used to conjugate gold nanoparticles and peptides rely on the establishment of sulfur\u2013gold bonds, which can be compromised by interference from other thiol-containing molecules that may be present in the medium. This may result in the effective displacement of the thiol-bonded peptide and thus lead to false-positive results. As a strategy to overcome this problem, Tang and coworkers evaluated the stability of selenol (\u2013SeH)-containing peptides as functionalizing groups in cell cultures [39]. The authors demonstrated that R\u2013SeH-functionalized particles exhibit higher performance and increased stability when exposed to high concentrations of glutathione (GSH) (5 mM) and to high temperatures, relative to their R\u2013SH counterparts. The selenium-functionalized systems showed increased SNR during in vitro tests in MCF-7 cells and serum, showing the potential of this strategy in the development of highly stable and reproducible gold-based nanosensors. Furthermore, the authors developed a multiplexing sensing system to study protease cascades in vitro that was able to discriminate between the activity of Caspase-3 (executioner) and that of -8 and -9 (initiators) with minimal background and nonspecific signal in real time [40,41].",

Succinctly, tumor margins are determined using fluorescence imaging activated by the proteolytic activity of MMP-2. After cleavage from MMP-2, a ligand (cRGD) becomes accessible and leads to preferential accumulation and internalization of T-MAN on tumor cells. Consequently, an MR image with enhanced contrast can be acquired due to the presence of Gd-doped CuS nanoparticles in the T-MAN nanohybrids. Additionally, CuS nanodisks exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency under NIR irradiation, which allows the killing of gastric tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model. The potential of these nanoprobes for theranostics of gastric tumors was demonstrated and it was proposed they may also be easily adaptable for other malignant tumors [46].",

In this design, the peptide substrate that crosses the nanopore-containing membrane produces only one major type of current modulation event. When the target protease is present or active, however, the substrate is cleaved in two differently sized fragments, producing two new types of blockage events with smaller residence times and/or amplitudes relative to the original substrate.

[49] developed an on-chip dual-sensing device for the detection of cell-secreted MMP-9 that simultaneously monitors cellular resistance and correlates it with the secretome and morphological analysis. The device comprises two independent sensing platforms featuring interdigitated-array microelectrodes (IDAMs) in one common fluidic chamber (Figure 3C). The goal of the device is to detect MMP-9 activity and understand cellular behavior during motility. On migration, cells tend to change morphology by extending their shape (i.e., lamellipodium formation) [50] and that increases resistance to the flow of electrical current between electrodes. The faster cells extend, the higher the value of the electrical resistance measured. During the migration process, MMP-9 was simultaneously secreted and diffused upwards from the cell binding site [49]. The substrate peptides at the upper site were proteolytically cleaved, causing a change in electrode capacitance. We believe that this dual-sensing method is interesting since it affords high versatility and could be applicable to a wide range of cell-secreted proteases by choosing the appropriate target proteins or peptides. Despite not being suitable for in vivo studies, this approach could deliver promising insights on the relation between the cellular secretome and morphological analysis in real time; for example, in the context of bioengineering approaches used for cellular differentiation.",

AVB-620 is a fluorescence-based sensor that is currently undergoing Phase III trials for breast cancer and entering Phase I trials for multiple cancers (Figure 4\n) [54]. In this hairpin sensor design, two fluorophores (Cy-5 and Cy-7) are in close proximity due to electrostatic interactions between two oppositely charged domains of the sensor molecule, which are bridged by a specifically targeted peptide sequence. In the absence of tumor-associated enzymes such as MMP-2 and -9, the two fluorophores are close to each other, with Cy-5 acting as an energy donor to Cy-7, which then emits brightly. In the presence of MMP-2/9, the target sequence is cleaved and the two fluorophores are separated, leading to a decrease in Cy-7 emission that is dependent on the protease activity as detected by fluorescence cameras, allowing intraoperative imaging in real time. Additionally, the presence of an activated cell penetration peptide (positively charged) in the resulting Cy-5-containing peptide fragment allows the fluorophore to be internalized by nearby cells, precisely delimiting tumor margins. The system did not exhibit significant side effects and showed improved performance in defining tumor margins. If the AVB-620 sensor is able to pass through the whole validation process, it will potentially encourage the development of protease-based theranostic systems.",

In our perspective, there are several opportunities and challenges that can and should be addressed in the future. For instance, to the best of our knowledge, multiplexing systems are so far based on optical methods only. New strategies for multiplexing can overcome the current limitations, increase diagnostic precision, and be helpful in correlating metabolic information between different enzymes. Within the same rational multiparametric systems, the work of Zhao et al. [38], in which proteolytic activity and pH are simultaneously evaluated in real time, also seems promising (Figure 5A).",

Despite most proteases tested as potential biomarkers being specific towards a target peptide sequence, often it is not possible to discriminate between two or more family-related proteases (i.e., MMP-2/9 and Cas-3/7). One possible strategy to achieve this goal was developed by Bainbridge et al. [55], who exchanged L-amino acids for their D- counterparts in the peptide structure when designing a fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-specific substrate. Although the kinetic parameters of the target protease were slightly influenced in a negative way, a specific target peptide without dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPPIV) interference was obtained (Figure 5B).",

By merging these concepts, one can imagine a machine analyzing the readout in real time and giving an immediate and proper response \u2013 for example, to stop/start the administration of a drug \u2013 in a feedback scheme and without the constant supervision of a healthcare professional.
