This is more likely to optimize the beneficial aspects of FPDR for both families and patients. Conversely, this will clearly increase the risk for relatives who are not already immune to the virus as well for the public health. A policy could however be put in place to mitigate these risks. Until vaccines become available, relatives may be asked to self-quarantine as a condition be present during CPR. This would at least reduce the risk to public health. With a reduced risk and thus burden on public, relatives could then make a value judgment that they alone can and should make-do the potential benefits of accompanying their loved ones during the last moments of their lives justify the risk to their own health?",
