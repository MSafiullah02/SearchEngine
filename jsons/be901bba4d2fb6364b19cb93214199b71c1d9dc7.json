This binary sequence will undoubtedly retain some biological information and lose the rest. Here we want to know what kind of and how much biological information an individual binary sequence carries. Three classifications of nucleotides are explored in the present article. Phylogenetic trees are built from these binary sequences by the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method, with evolutionary distance evaluated on the basis of a symbolic sequence complexity. We find that, for all data sets studied, binary sequences reduced by the purine/pyrimidine classification give reliable phylogeny (almost the same as that from the primary sequences), while the other two result in discrepancies at different levels. Some possible reasons and a simple model of sequence evolutionary are introduced to interpret this phenomenon.",

Mathematically, we can achieve this aim by a map from one object to another reduced by the original, such as homomorphism in algebra, homotopy and homology in topology, and fiber bundles in differential geometry. From this consideration, we studied a \"coarse grained\" description of primary DNA sequence as follows [6] . In the first step, nucleotides are classified into different groups according to their chemical structures, e.g., purine R = {A,G} and pyrimidine Y = {C,T}. Based on this classification, the (R,Y)-characteristic sequence (or (R,Y)-sequence, for short) of a DNA sequence is then obtained by replacing elements of R with 1 and Y with 0. Likewise, the (M,K)-sequence and the (S,W)-sequence can be constructed according to the classifications M = {A,C}, K = {G,T} and S = {G,C}, W = {A,T}, respectively. It is easy to show that each pair of characteristic sequences can reconstruct the primary sequence. In this sense, no information is lost during these reductions. Moreover, an individual binary sequence may carry a certain kind of information, this provides us a new way to analyze biological information from different aspects. In recent years, some related binary representations of biological molecules have been used broadly in graphical representation and comparison of DNA sequences [7, 8] , phylogenetic tree construction [9] , gene identification [10] , etc.",

In other words, whether molecular phylogeny can be reconstructed from only one kind of these binary sequences? In Sect. 2, a universal distance measure for symbolic sequences, which makes use of a sequence complexity (Lempel-Ziv complexity) , is introduced. In Sect. 3, three widely used datasets are considered. For each dataset, its corresponding (R,Y)-sequences ((M,K)-and (S,W)-sequences, respectively) are got and used to reconstruct phylogeny. Through comparing these phylogenies with that built from primary DNA sequences and the commonly accepted one, we draw a conclusion that (R,Y)-sequences can solely determine a reliable phylogeny, while phylogenies from (M,K)-and (S,W)-sequences have discrepancies at different levels. Then, some possible reasons for this phenomenon and a simple model of sequence evolution are presented. Our result could serve as an alternative method of phylogenetic tree construction and help to understand the mechanism of sequence evolution.",

Similarly, an extension S = T R of T is called producible (denoted T \u21d2 S) if T \u2192 S(1, L(S) \u2212 1). That is to say, an extra 'different' symbol at the end of the producible extension is allowed. For example, AACGT \u21d2 AACGTCGTCGW. Thus we can say if T \u2192 S then T \u21d2 S, but the reverse is not always true. If T \u21d2 S and T S, this extension is called exhaustive. According to the above definitions, any sequence S can be generated from the null sequence using iterative producible processes. For example, S = AACACG can be generated by the following steps: \u03c6 \u21d2 A\u21d2 AA \u21d2 AAC \u21d2 AACA \u21d2 AACAC \u21d2 AACACG, or \u03c6 \u21d2 A \u21d2 AAC \u21d2 AACACG. A generation is called exhaustive if its extension steps are exhaustive (with an exception of the final step) and the number of steps are defined as the LZ complexity (c(S)) of S. Accordingly, the later generation process of AACACG is exhaustive, so c(AACACG) = 3. It is clear to say the LZ complexity of any sequence is unique and c(S) is the minimum number of steps which S can generated from a null sequence using producible process.",

Full genome sequences of 24 coronaviruses including SARS-CoVs and a torovirus are downloaded from Gen-Bank (data are shown in Table 1 ). Coronaviruses are members of a family of enveloped viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of animal host cell. According to the type of the host, coronaviruses isolated previously can be classified into three groups, groups I and II contain mammalian viruses, whereas group III contains only avian viruses. In order to infer the evolutionary relationships between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, Marra et al. [23] and Rota et al. [24] first chose data from above three groups and some SARS-CoV strains to construct phylogenetic tree. Their results indicated that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses and form a novel, fourth group of coronaviruses. Using similar data set, Zheng et al. [25] applied a geometric approach. They transformed each of the coronavirus genomes into \"Z-Curve\"-an equivalent graphical representation of DNA sequence, and then used the geometric center and three associated eigenvectors of the \"Z-Curves\" as [26] . In this experiment, we choose the equine torovirus as our outgroup. The resulting phylogenetic topologies are shown in Fig. 3 . As with the previous results, trees constructed from (R,Y)-sequences and primary sequences are mainly consistent except for some positions of SARS-CoVs. However, these discrepancies are acceptable since all SARS-CoV strains are almost completely identical in sequence (\u223c99% aligned sequence identity). In such case, chance plays a more important role, and therefore it is not possible to get any meaningful phylogeny within the SARS-CoV group. Just like the above two experiments, trees from (M,Y)and (S,W)-sequences have obvious discrepancies with Fig. 3a at different levels.",

This can be interpreted from an informational perspective. Since point mutations are less likely to alter the purine/pyrimidine distribution, (R,Y)-sequence is relatively stable, while (M,Y)-and (S,W)-sequences are more sensitive to mutations. Therefore the sensitive one is expected to get a more reliable result when mutation rates are very small. While in the case of high mutation rates, the sensitive one may be disturbed by random mutation and the stable one will dominant.",

Compared to the primary sequence, these binary sequences have much higher compression ratio. This will, on one hand, reduce the storage space and execution time (Table 2) , and on the other hand, facilitate the use of some signal processing techniques in biological data analysis. However, drawing the above conclusion from only one method (LZ complexity) is not so convincing. We have also tried some other sequence comparison methods, e.g., k-mers composition and traditional alignment. But k-mers based methods got poor results for all datasets even using primary sequences (representing sequences as vectors of k-mer frequencies may lose too much information), and alignments also fail to compare binary sequences for the lack of reliable score matrix.",
