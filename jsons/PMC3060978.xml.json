After binding of the pathogen, a rearrangement of the crystallizable fragment (Fc)-conformation enables C1q to bind onto the Fc-region of the antibody. Because of the pentamer structure of IgM, one molecule is sufficient to activate the complement. IgG has a monomer structure, and therefore two molecules are required. Binding of C1q activates C1r and leads to cleavage of C1s. Activated C1s can then cleave C4 into the anaphylatoxins C4a and C4b, the latter binding to the surface of the pathogen and activating C2 by splitting it into C2b and C2a. C2b diffuses while C2a remains bound to C4b and together they form the C3 convertase C4b2a.",

This event, as well as the small fragment Ba, produces the C3 convertase of the alternative pathway C3(H2O)Bb. Binding of the protein properdin stabilizes the fragment, extending the half-life 10-fold.

In contrast to the three different upstream paths forming a C5 convertase, only the cleavage of C5 into the anaphylatoxin C5a and the active C5b represents an enzymatic step, while the rest of the cascade is solely an accretion of stable proteins. In detail, C5b remains bound to the target cell followed by association of C6, resulting in a hydrophilic complex. By accretion of C7, a conformational change occurs\u2014facilitating a stable linkage by exposure of lipophilic groups. Attachment of C8 with its binding component, C8b, induces the penetration of C8a-g into the lipid double layer of the target cell membrane. The final step toward formation of a stable transmembrane pore with a diameter of 10 angstrom is the binding of 10\u201315 C9 proteins, which generate a cylindrical structure (Figure 2). Assembly of such a pore may lead to osmotic imbalance through the constant flow of ions, small molecules and water along their concentration gradient, resulting in the lysis of the target cell (26).",

The small activation products C3a, C4a and particularly C5a are potent anaphylatoxins, capable of inducing the migration of phagocytes (29), smooth muscle relaxation, degranulation of mast cells and basophile granulocytes and therefore unleashing vasoactive substances such as histamine, prostaglandins, kinins and serotonin. All can cause va-sodilation and capillary leakage (30) and induce the migrated cells to release eicosanoids, oxygen radicals and lysosomal enzymes, which cause damage to the pathogens (31\u201333). It is noteworthy, that complement acts far beyond \u201cinflammation,\u201d as indicated by its close interaction with the coagulation cascade (34\u201336) and its involvement in the regulation of apoptosis (37\u201340) and cellular growth (41). The anaphylactoid functions are mediated by the interaction of C3a and C5a with their corresponding seven-transmembrane\u2013spanning receptors C3aR and C5aR (CD88), respectively (see Figure 2). The role of the second C5a receptor named C5L2 is not fully understood and is still controversially discussed. However, there is increasing evidence that C5L2 represents a functional receptor acting as a negative regulator of the inflammatory response. For example, it was shown that inflammation in C5L2 knock-out mice was amplified (42) and that blockage of C5L2 increased serum interleukin (IL)-6 (43).",

In particular, the expression of various complement factors might depend on the cell differentiation state. Murine osteoblastic cells were shown to produce C3 in response to vitamin D3 (67,68). During osteoblastic differentiation in murine osteoblasts and in human cell lines, the complement components C1q, C4, C1 inhibitor, C3a receptor (C3aR), properdin and the complement factor H were upregulated (69), whereas the expression of the subcomponents C1r and C1s together with factor H was decreased (70). The expression of functionally active C5a receptor (C5aR; CD88) that modulated IL-6 production was described in a human osteoblastic cell line (71,72).

It is noteworthy that many cells of the central nervous system are more susceptible to a complement attack, since they lack important complement regulators such as CD59 (84). Complement products were demonstrated to be dramatically upregulated in models of cerebral ischemia in rats (85), and evidence for deposition of C3d and C9 after experimental cerebral contusion was found (86). In agreement with these experimental findings, systemic complement activation has been shown in stroke patients (87). A negative role for complement has been proposed in traumatic brain injury, since systemic depletion of complement by infusion of the cobra venom factor improved blood flow and neurological function and reduced cerebral edema during experimental intracerebral hemorrhage (88,89). Moreover, C1 deficiency (90) and complement inhibition by infusion of the C1 inhibitor revealed some neuroprotective effects (91,92). In contradiction to these results for traumatic/ischemic injuries, C1q has a strong neuroprotective effect in neurodegenerative diseases (93). Traumatic brain injury induces C5aR upregulation in an experimental model in rats with enhanced C5a serum levels for >1 week. The functional consequences of traumatic brain injury\u2013induced systemic C5a generation have still to be elucidated (94).",

Several studies have shown low MBL serum levels (genetically derived) are correlated with enhanced development of systemic immune response syndrome/sepsis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (126,127). Low MBL serum concentrations were also associated with the development of pneumonia after surgery in colorectal cancer patients (128). Similarly, MASP-2 deficiency caused increased infection rates with Streptococcus pneumoniae (129). Furthermore, there is evidence for a higher rate of chorioamnionitis in patients with low MBL levels and preterm birth (130). Low MBL serum levels appear to be associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion based on in utero infection. This was proposed by Kruse et al. (131), who demonstrated that patients with MBL levels <100 ng/mL had a higher abortion rate. Some urogenital infections such as vulvovaginitis, herpes simplex virus-2 infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis and vestibulitis appear to be linked to low MBL levels in comparison to healthy controls (132\u2013134). Downstream complement deficiencies are typically associated with recurrent invasive infections of Neisseria meningitidis and gonorrhea (135).",
