            "text": "Corticosteroids inhibit the expression and action of many inflammatory mediators. To exert their effects, corticosteroids need to bind to a specific cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) found in respiratory epithelial cells and other cell lines. The activation of the GR by the administration of the corticosteroids moves the drug\u2013receptor complex into the nucleus of the cell and binds to the DNA.11 The anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids are achieved by two distinct mechanisms. First, activated GR to specific DNA sequences located in the promoter regions of target genes to induce transcription of anti-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1 receptor, or Lipocortin 1 (transactivation). Second, an indirect negative regulation of gene expression is also achieved by GR\u2013protein interaction (transrepression). The activated GR binds to key proinflammatory transcription factors such as activator protein 1 and nuclear factor \u03baB. The resulting complex inhibits the initiation of transcription of relevant genes that play a central role in inflammation.11 For that reason, the synthesis of several cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis alpha [TNF\u03b1], ILs 4, 5, 6, and 13, adhesion molecules [e.g, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1], and chemokines [e.g., eotaxin and IL-8]) is inhibited.13\n14\n",

Salluh et al23 studied the impact of corticosteroids on the clinical course and outcomes of 111 patients with CAP requiring mechanical ventilation, where 55% of the patients received corticosteroids due to bronchospasm or septic shock. In this study, the adjunctive use of corticosteroids did not influence mortality, organ failure, or withdrawal of vasopressors. However, a recent Japanese study including 2,524 patients with severe CAP showed that low-dose corticosteroid therapy reduced 28-day mortality among those patients with CAP complicated by septic shock.24 Nevertheless, this benefit was not observed among patients with severe CAP without septic shock. All of these findings suggested that corticosteroids may reduce mortality in patients with severe CAP. However, these observations may be due to the overinclusion of patients with septic shock or with other conditions known to benefit from corticosteroids treatment, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma.",

Confalonieri et al25 assessed the efficacy and safety of continuous infusion of hydrocortisone in 46 patients with CAP requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. These authors demonstrated a mortality reduction in the group treated with corticosteroids, a better modulation of systemic inflammatory response, and significant improvement in clinical endpoints, such as chest X-ray, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome severity scale, PaO2:FiO2 ratio, and ICU and hospital stay. The limitation of this study was the small sample size and differences among groups on admission, which limited the generability of these results. Snijders et al26 studied the impact of prednisolone compared with placebo among 213 hospitalized patients with CAP. In this study, the authors found no differences regarding the rate of 30-day mortality, time to clinically stability, or length of hospital stay. Patients treated with corticosteroids had faster decline in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels compared with placebo. However, late clinical failure (>72 hours from admission) was more common in the corticosteroid group. Meijvis et al27 evaluated the effect of intravenous (IV) dexamethasone versus placebo in the first 4 days after CAP admission in 304 patients. The authors found no differences in the main outcomes, including inhospital mortality, ICU admission, and severe adverse events. However, patients treated with corticosteroid had a shorter length of hospital stay compared with the placebo group. Fern\u00e1ndez-Serrano et al28 described in a study of 56 hospitalized patients with CAP that combination of antibiotics with methylprednisolone improved respiratory failure rates and accelerated the timing of clinical resolution. No serious side effects related to corticosteroids were described in any of these clinical studies.",

Our group demonstrated that acute administration of methylprednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/12 hours during 5 days) decrease treatment failure in a population of 120 patients with severe CAP who had high inflammatory response (defined as CRP greater than 150 mg/L on admission).29 In this study, the primary outcome was treatment failure, a composite outcome of early treatment failure based on clinical deterioration, need for subsequent mechanical ventilation, and death within 72 hours of treatment, or a composite outcome of late treatment failure, based on radiographic progression, persistent respiratory failure, development of shock, and subsequent need for mechanical ventilation, death within 72 hours, or a composite of both early and late treatment failure. In the corticosteroid group, treatment failure was less common (13 vs. 31%), especially in late treatment failure (3 vs. 25%). When individual components of treatment failure were evaluated, differences among groups were found in the radiographic progression (2% in the corticosteroid group vs. 15% in the control group). Inhospital mortality did not differ among groups, and no side effects related to corticosteroids were found. Blum et al30 showed that prednisone treatment for 7 days in patients admitted with CAP shortens time to clinical stability without an increase in complications. Again, no differences in mortality among groups were found and no adverse events were described. ",

A Cochrane meta-analysis31 selected six RCTs of corticosteroids in pneumonia including 437 participants. The use of corticosteroids accelerated the resolution of symptoms and time to clinical stability. However, corticosteroids did not provide a benefit in mortality, and the authors concluded that it was not possible to make any definitive recommendations because the studies taken account in the meta-analysis were not strong enough. Nie et al32 performed another meta-analysis including nine RCTs with 1,001 patients and showed that the use of corticosteroids was not associated with significant lower mortality considering all the patients (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.37\u20131.04). However, a survival benefit was detected in the subgroup of patients with severe CAP (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.11\u20130.64) and among patients with prolonged corticosteroids treatment (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.26\u20130.97). Prolonged corticosteroid treatment was defined as more than 5 days of corticosteroids treatment with a maximum of 9 days. Considering the adverse effects, corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (OR: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.68\u20134.15), but without increasing the risk of superinfection (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.65\u20132.84) and gastroduodenal bleeding (OR: 1.67; 95% CI: 0.41\u20136.80). These results were very similar with another more recent systematic review and meta-analysis that included 2,077 patients from 14 trials.33 Again, adjunctive corticosteroid therapy was associated with decreased 30-day mortality among patients with severe CAP (relative risk [RR]: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.23\u20130.96) but not in the whole CAP population. In addition, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a reduction of severe complications (RR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.23\u20130.56), a shorter length of stay (9.0 vs. 10.6 days), and a shorter time to clinical stability (3.3 vs. 4.3 days). The main limitation of these meta-analyses was the inclusion of trials with heterogeneous severity (from mild to severe) and different dosage of corticosteroids.",

Two other RCTs evaluated the effect of statin therapy on mortality in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Makris et al48 found a trend of increased survival in the pravastatin group but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.7). In this study, the authors stratified data according to median APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) scores and found a significantly increased probability of being free from VAP during the whole ICU period (p = 0.04) in the pravastatin group. However, in another RCT including 284 patients having suspected VAP, Papazian et al49 showed that adjunctive statins therapy in VAP did not improve 28-day survival. In 2015, Viasus et al50 evaluated the clinical outcomes and concentration of inflammatory cytokines in a randomized trial in patients with CAP treated with simvastatin and concluded that the use of simvastatin did not reduce the time to clinical stability or the levels of inflammatory cytokines in hospitalized patients with CAP.",

Other adjunctive therapies such as statins and IGs have been tested, although the role of these options in the treatment of CAP is still not clear.
