It occurs at a basal level in nutrient-rich conditions but can be upregulated in response to various stress conditions, such as starvation. Autophagy can be non-selective (that is, a portion of the cytoplasm is engulfed, for example, in response to amino acid deprivation) or selective. Selective autophagy targets various cargoes for degradation; this includes organelle-specific autophagy (including mitophagy, pexophagy and reticulophagy) and xenophagy (which is the degradation of microorganisms)1.",

Autophagy can be induced on bacterial infection and involves the formation of double-membrane compartments (known as autophagosomes) around target bacteria and their transport to lysosomes for degradation2. Extensive work has been done to determine the induction and targeting mechanisms of antibacterial autophagy. It is now thought that multiple host factors and pathways are activated and contribute to this process.",

The Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1; known as Atg1 in yeast) complex (which comprises ULK1, ATG13, FAK family kinase-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200) and ATG101 (also known as C12orf44)) is the signal initiation complex and has a key role in recruiting ATG proteins to the PAS17. In the presence of nutrients, the ULK1 complex is inhibited by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1; which promotes growth in nutrient-rich conditions)17. mTORC1 phosphorylates ULK1 and ATG13, thus inhibiting the recruitment of the ULK1 complex to the PAS18,19. By contrast, when mTORC1 is inactive (during nutrient limitation or rapamycin treatment), ULK1 is released18,19, which enables it to phosphorylate FIP200, translocate to the PAS and recruit other ATG proteins to initiate autophagosome formation18,19,20. The ULK1 complex is also essential for initiation during selective autophagy, although, in most cases, it is unclear whether ULK1 recruitment is regulated by mTORC1 or by other signalling molecules. For example, in yeast, Atg1 is required for pexophagy21, mitophagy22 and the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway (Cvt pathway)23, and in mammals FIP200 is crucial for the autophagic degradation of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium24.",

This is achieved by engaging PtdIns3-kinase class III (PtdIns3KC3; Vps34 in yeast), resulting in the production of PtdIns3P at the phagophore. This leads to the recruitment of PtdIns3P-binding proteins, such as WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting 1 (WIPI1; Atg18 in yeast) and WIPI2 (Atg21 in yeast) to the PAS to aid phagophore assembly by, at least in yeast, recruiting downstream Atg proteins (Atg16 and Atg8; see below)25,26. ATG9 is also important for phagophore assembly. In yeast, Atg9 exits from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and associates with small vesicles27,28, some of which contribute membranes, at least partially, for phagophore biogenesis27,28. In mammals, ATG9 localizes at the TGN and on endosomes, transiently interacts with omegasomes and is required for PAS formation and expansion29,30. However, ATG9 is not incorporated into the PAS.",

            "text": "Autophagosome elongation is mediated by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. The ATG12\u2013ATG5 ubiquitin-like-conjugate, which is activated by the E1-like enzyme ATG7 and the E2-like enzyme ATG10, promotes phagophore elongation31,32. In addition, ATG12\u2013ATG5 forms a complex with ATG16L1, which associates with the expanding phagophore membrane33 but is released from the autophagosome membrane when the vesicle is complete32. The fusion of ATG16L1- associated precursor vesicles with each other is mediated by SNARE proteins and possibly contributes to the phagophore expansion process34. ATG12\u2013ATG5 is necessary for the formation of the second ubiquitin-like conjugate, light chain 3 (LC3; also known as MAP1LC3B; Atg8 in yeast)\u2013phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which is activated by the E1-like enzyme ATG7 and the E2-like enzyme ATG3. The ATG12\u2013ATG5\u2013ATG16L1 complex directs LC3 to the target membrane35, where it becomes conjugated to PE by the E3-like enzyme activity of ATG12\u2013ATG5 (Ref. 36). The cysteine protease ATG4B is also required for LC3\u2013PE formation, as it cleaves the carboxyl terminus of LC3 and exposes a glycine residue that is then covalently attached to PE37. In addition, ATG4B deconjugates a proportion of the LC3\u2013PE complexes when autophagosome formation is complete, thus facilitating the recycling of LC3 for the formation of new autophagosomes37,38. Recent studies in yeast indicate that this deconjugation process is necessary for efficient autophagosome biogenesis as well as for maturation of the autophagosome into a fusion-capable autophagosome38,39. LC3 has been shown to mediate the hemifusion of vesicles and to control the size of the autophagosome in yeast40,41.",

In mammalian cells, cargo-specific receptors usually contain an LC3-interacting region (LIR) that mediates the recruitment of LC3-decorated autophagosomes to the cargo (for example, mitochondria)47,48,49. Moreover, ubiquitin-associated cargoes are recognized by ubiquitin-binding protein adaptors, which also contain LIRs50. One example is p62, which links various cargo targets, including ubiquitylated protein aggregates51,52, ubiquitin-tagged peroxisomes53 and bacteria8,54,55, to autophagosomes. Other adaptor proteins that have both a ubiquitin-binding domain and an LIR have also been discovered, including NBR1 (next to BRCA1 gene 1)56, NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa; also known as CALCOCO2)57 and optineurin58. NBR1 is involved in the targeting of protein aggregates56, peroxisomes59 and the bacterial pathogen Francisella tularensis60 for autophagy; NDP52 and optineurin, together with p62, are involved in the autophagy of S.

Recent studies have identified alternative autophagy pathways that are independent of some of the core machinery components; these are known as non-canonical forms of autophagy. For example, autophagy that is independent of ULK1 and ULK2 has been observed after long-term glucose starvation61. Moreover, a recent study found that autophagy can occur in Atg5-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts62. ATG5-independent autophagy, which contributes to organelle clearance during erythrocyte maturation, depends on the ULK1 complex and BECN1 but does not require LC3\u2013PE and several other essential conventional autophagy components, including ATG7, ATG12, ATG16L1 and ATG9. BECN1-independent autophagy has also been identified in cancer cell lines, in which it is induced by apoptotic stimuli, such as staurosporine63, and by the antioxidant resveratrol64, as well as in non-tumour cell lines, in which it is induced by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium65 and by the recombinant viral capsid protein VP1 of foot-and-mouth disease virus66, among others. BECN1-independent autophagy involves the formation of double-membrane autophagosomes and requires the ULK1 complex, ATG5, ATG7 and LC3\u2013PE conjugation systems, but the exact mechanism remains unclear63,64,67.",

Typhimurium uses its two type III secretion systems (T3SSs; encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and SPI-2) to invade epithelial cells, and typically resides in the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV)74. However, a subset of bacteria damages the SCV membrane early after infection, via SPI-1 T3SS pore-forming activities on the vacuolar membrane, and can potentially escape into the cytosol to obtain nutrients for rapid growth75. Some of the cytosol-exposed bacteria are targeted by autophagy within damaged SCVs, as shown by the recruitment of LC3 and other ATG proteins to the bacteria.

Evidence suggests that SCV membrane damage exposes specific signature molecules either on the bacterial surface or on the inner face of the SCV membrane, and in turn, these molecules recruit adaptor proteins from the cytosol that then recruit autophagy components to the SCV (Fig. 2b). For example, it has been shown that a population of bacteria is associated with ubiquitylated proteins shortly after invasion, indicating exposure to the cytosol76. These ubiquitin-positive bacteria also colocalize with adaptor protein p62 (see above) and LC3 (Ref. 55), which suggests that p62 links the bacteria to autophagosomes via LC3. The adaptor protein optineurin58 also has a role in bacterial autophagy: phosphorylation of optineurin by the innate immune receptor TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1; which activates the transcription of type I interferons (IFNs)) strengthens its interaction with LC3, which restricts the intracellular growth of S. Typhimurium58. Recently, a host ubiquitin E3 ligase, leucine-rich repeat and sterile \u03b1-motif-containing 1 (LRSAM1), was found to have a role in the ubiquitylation of proteins that are associated with the autophagy of S.

Typhimurium24. However, targeting of LC3 to the SCV is independent of the essential autophagy factors (the ULK1 complex, the BECN1 complex and ATG9). Therefore, LC3 can be recruited to SCVs by at least one other, non-canonical pathway. Indeed, S. Typhimurium is also targeted by the LAP pathway. It has been shown that NADPH oxidase and ROS are necessary for efficient recruitment of LC3 to bacteria70. In addition, the lipid signalling molecule diacylglycerol (DAG) is recruited to SCVs, and its production is necessary for efficient LC3 recruitment to bacteria79. In fact, DAG-positive bacteria are not associated with ubiquitin or p62, and inhibiting both DAG and p62 leads to an additive inhibitory effect on LC3 recruitment to the bacteria. These results suggest that the DAG pathway and the ubiquitin-adaptor pathway contribute independently to the recruitment of LC3 to S. Typhimurium. The downstream effector of DAG, protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4), is also required for LC3 recruitment to bacteria79. PKC\u03b4 can activate NADPH oxidase by phosphorylation of one of its components80, which suggests that DAG-dependent LC3 targeting of bacteria involves the PKC\u03b4\u2013NADPH oxidase\u2013ROS pathway. It remains unknown what triggers the translocation of DAG to the SCVs. The SPI-1 T3SS of S. Typhimurium is required for DAG localization on the SCVs, suggesting that either bacterial effectors or the membrane damage caused by T3SS pore-forming activity is involved. Whether LAP occurs before canonical autophagy targets S. Typhimurium is not clear. ROS production is very rapid after bacterial invasion (peaking at \u223c10 min post-infection)81, and association of DAG with S. Typhimurium peaks at 30 min post-infection79. It has also been suggested that ROS might contribute to damaging SCV membranes. Therefore, activation of LAP signalling might occur slightly earlier than activation of the ubiquitin\u2013adaptor\u2013autophagy pathway. Correlative electron microscopy studies are needed to distinguish LAP from the canonical autophagy pathway.",

During infection of macrophages, M. tuberculosis blocks phagosome maturation and replicates in the phagosome. A recent study showed that \u223c30% of phagosomal mycobacteria were selectively targeted by LC3 and ATG12 by 4 hours post-infection82. The membrane-permeabilization factor early secreted antigenic target of 6 kDa (ESAT-6; also known as EsxA), which is the major substrate secreted from the bacterial type VII secretion system ESX-1, is required for the targeting of M. tuberculosis for autophagy. Autophagy is thought to be triggered following damage to the M. tuberculosis-containing phagosomes, with ubiquitylation of host and bacterial proteins having a major role. Ubiquitin-associated bacteria colocalize with p62, NDP52 and LC3, which suggests that phagosomal damage triggers bacterial targeting by LC3 and adaptor proteins, and thus allows targeting of the bacteria by selective autophagy82. The same study found that naked bacterial DNA in the host cytosol can function as the signal that triggers autophagy, possibly through the activation of TBK1 and STING, both of which are necessary for ubiquitin-mediated selective autophagy of M. tuberculosis83. The ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin was recently implicated in autophagy of these bacteria84.",

When actively invading HeLa cells, GAS escapes from the endosomes to the cytoplasm, in a process that is mediated by the toxin streptolysin O (SLO), a member of a family of cholesterol-dependent pore-forming cytolysins86. Most cytosolic bacteria are enveloped in LC3-decorated, GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles (GcAVs) and are degraded through autophagy85 (Fig. 2a). GcAV formation and bacterial clearance are severely impaired in Atg5-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts compared with wild-type cells, in which most bacteria are killed during the first 4 hours post-infection. Moreover, SLO is necessary for autophagic targeting of the bacteria, as SLO-deficient mutants are not sequestered in LC3-positive autophagic structures and survive longer than wild-type bacteria85,86. Notably, SLO-deficient mutants remain in endosomes and cannot escape to the cytosol of HeLa cells, so bacterial exposure to the cytosol may function as the signal for antibacterial autophagy. Engagement of the human cell surface pathogen receptor CD46 has also been shown to induce autophagy clearance of GAS by activating BECN1 and PtdIns3KC3 (Ref. 87).",

However, in this study, SLO was shown to promote bacterial survival in human oropharyngeal keratinocytes. Together with NAD glycohydrolase, a toxin that is encoded in the same operon, SLO inhibits the fusion of GcAVs with lysosomes89. Thus, in human oropharyngeal keratinocytes, GAS infection induces the xenophagic response, but bacterial toxins inhibit the formation of mature autolysosomes and enable bacterial survival. This is a more complex interaction between bacteria and autophagy than that seen in HeLa cells, in which autophagy kills most bacteria during early infection85.",

For example, it has been shown that, early after S. Typhimurium infection (1 hour post-infection), membrane damage triggers a transient cytosolic amino acid starvation response, as shown by the activation of the amino acid sensor GCN2 (a kinase that phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor-2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), which controls protein synthesis)5. This acute amino acid starvation inhibits mTORC1 activity and relocalizes mTOR (which is a part of mTORC1) from the late endosome to the cytosol5, thus activating autophagy signalling. However, by 4 hours post-infection, the cytosolic amino acid pool is restored and mTOR is reactivated; mTOR then relocalizes to late endosomes and SCVs, thus inhibiting autophagy targeting towards S. Typhimurium (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, inactivation of mTORC1 by rapamycin treatment resulted in an association of \u223c50% of bacteria with LC3 at 4 hours post-infection, which suggests that S. Typhimurium escapes autophagy targeting at this time point by promoting mTORC1 activation. Although it remains unclear how this is achieved, it has been shown that SPI-2 T3SS is upregulated 4 hours after infection94, and SPI-2 T3SS, or its secreted effectors, might have a role in the relocalization of mTORC1 regulators to the SCVs.",

In this bacterial strain, deletion of the gene encoding Eis (enhanced intracellular survival) induces the formation of autophagosomes following the infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages, which suggests that Eis can inhibit autophagy activation during infection by wild-type bacteria95. Further analysis revealed that this is achieved by interfering with JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling, thus blocking the production of ROS (which are required for autophagy triggering): Eis-mutant bacteria were found to activate JNK and to consequently promote the production of ROS95. Eis is an N-acetyltransferase that acetylates and activates a JNK-specific phosphatase, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 7, which inhibits JNK phosphorylation and leads to its inactivation96.",

Many bacteria express cAMP-increasing toxins to inhibit host innate immune responses. For example, oedema factor toxin from Bacillus anthracis is an adenylyl cyclase that can directly increase intracellular cAMP levels100, and cholera toxin from Vibrio cholerae is an ADP ribosyltransferase that is capable of indirectly increasing cAMP by activating host adenylyl cyclases101. Both toxins have inhibitory effects on host cell autophagy induction: when cells were treated with purified toxins, the induction of different types of autophagy was significantly reduced, including rapamycin-induced autophagy, S. Typhimurium-induced autophagy and LAP4, suggesting that cAMP regulates an upstream signal that is common for all of the above tested autophagy pathways.",

For example, Legionella pneumophila induces autophagy in infected mouse macrophages in a manner that is dependent on the bacterial type IV secretion system (T4SS; known as the Dot/Icm secretion system)102. The bacterium is internalized in a phagosome wrapped by ER structures (a process that is thought to favour bacterial growth), in which autophagy components, such as ATG7 and LC3, are sequentially recruited to eventually deliver the bacterium to lysosomes102. However, it was recently shown that L. pneumophila can avoid autophagy targeting during infection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells10 by the production of the T4SS effector RavZ. This protein functions as an ATG4B-like cysteine protease that directly targets the amide bond between the tyrosine and the glycine at the C terminus of LC3, which is covalently linked to PE on autophagy induction to form LC3\u2013PE10. Therefore, RavZ irreversibly deconjugates LC3 from PE and inhibits autophagosome formation. This is the first evidence of a bacterial effector protein mimicking the function of a host autophagy component to modify another critical autophagy protein and inhibit the whole process.",

Recent studies have shown that RAB1 is required for autophagosome formation in mammalian cells103,104, possibly by controlling the levels of PtdIns3P on the omegasome by targeting the PtdIns3-phosphatase myotubularin-related 6 to the omegasomal membrane105. Another study reported that the S. flexneri T3SS effector VirA has a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, which suggests that it can inactivate RAB GTPases9. Indeed, in wild-type bacteria, VirA inactivates RAB1, thus inhibiting autophagy induction and, in the absence of VirA, bacteria are more efficiently decorated by LC3 (Ref. 9) (Fig. 3b).",

One such example is S. flexneri, which produces IcsB, a virulence factor secreted by the T3SS that is important for bacterial pathogenesis at a post-invasion stage106,107. \u0394icsB bacteria, which still escape into the cytosol, have a reduced ability to spread into neighbouring cells in certain polarized cells106,107. These bacteria become sequestered in multilamellar autophagosomes by the ubiquitin\u2013p62 and NDP52\u2013LC3 pathways, and show defective replication6,54. Compared with \u0394icsB bacteria (of which \u223c35% are targeted to autophagosomes at 2 hours post-infection and \u223c50% are targeted to autophagosomes at 6 hours post-infection), only \u223c10% of wild-type bacteria are targeted for autophagy throughout the first 6 hours of infection, which suggests that S. flexneri uses IcsB to escape autophagy6. In fact, IcsB binds to a bacterial surface protein, IcsA (also known as VirG), and competes with its binding to host ATG5, thereby masking the bacteria from ATG protein recognition6 (Fig. 3b). In addition, when compared with wild-type bacteria, \u0394icsB mutants are more frequently surrounded by cage-like structures formed by septins, a group of conserved GTP-binding proteins that are often found at the cell-bud neck during cell division, and these entrapped bacteria are targeted for autophagy108. As septins are necessary for the recruitment of ubiquitin, p62 and NDP52 to the bacteria54, it is possible that IcsB masks the bacteria from septins and prevents their autophagic targeting. Identifying the septin binding partners on bacteria and elucidating their interactions with IcsB will be necessary to fully understand how IcsB blocks septin cage capture.",

During L. monocytogenes infection of mouse macrophages, the bacterium is internalized by phagocytosis but damages the phagosomal membrane, by secretion of the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) and other bacterial and host factors, and escapes into the cytosol to replicate109. Cytosolic bacteria express ActA, a cell surface protein that recruits the host ARP2/3 (actin-related protein 2/3) complex, which can then polymerize actin on the bacterial surface. The forces that are associated with actin polymerization promote bacterial intracellular motility and cell-to-cell spread110, which are thought to help the bacteria to escape autophagosome capture111,112. Notably, \u0394actA mutant bacteria are sequestered in LC3-positive, double-membrane vacuoles following the addition of the antibiotic chloramphenicol to block bacterial protein synthesis111,113. By contrast, wild-type bacteria are not targeted for autophagy even when treated with chloramphenicol, which suggests that when bacteria have acquired actin on their cell surface they become capable of escaping autophagy at later times during the infection. However, another study using a different L. monocytogenes strain found that it was not the actin-based motility but instead the ability of ActA to recruit host proteins (such as actin, the ARP2/3 complex and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) that enabled the bacteria to escape autophagy8. Specifically, at 2 hours and 4 hours post-infection, only \u223c5% of wild-type bacteria were LC3-positive (and thus targeted for autophagy), but nearly 60% of \u0394actA2 bacteria were associated with LC3 (Ref. 8). However, actA-mutant bacteria, which cannot polymerize actin and lack motility but can recruit other host proteins, successfully escaped autophagy recognition. This suggests that L. monocytogenes uses ActA to recruit host cytoskeleton proteins on the bacterial surface and mask the bacterium from ubiquitin recognition and autophagy targeting.",

Some bacteria use their effector proteins to escape autophagy by mechanisms that remain unclear in terms of the target of the effectors or the exact stage of autophagy that they interfere with. One such example is the Gram-negative bacterium B. pseudomallei, which uses a T3SS to escape from the phagosome into the cytosol, where it obtains actin-based motility, replicates and disseminates. Studies have shown that a very small population (\u223c5\u201310%) of wild-type B. pseudomallei is targeted for LAP72. Mutants that lack the T3SS3 effector BopA or the translocator BipD are defective in phagosomal escape and exhibit higher levels of colocalization with LC3 (\u223c30\u201340%) and LAMP1, indicating that wild-type bacteria use T3SS3 to avoid autophagy recognition. However, most wild-type bacteria enter the cytosol but are not targeted by autophagy. In this case, evasion of autophagy is mediated by T3SS1, as bacteria that lack the putative T3SS1 ATPase encoded by bpscN successfully enter the cytosol but are more efficiently targeted by LC3 and show defective survival in RAW macrophages114,115.",

The bacteria become sequestered in double-membrane autophagosomes during infection of HeLa cells, but fusion of these autophagosome with the lysosome is inhibited and they are used as replicative niches13. Following replication, the bacteria escape into the cytosol and cause autophagy-dependent cell death, and this depends on host ATG5 (Ref. 13) (but not on PtdIns3KC3 and BECN1 (Ref. 139)) and the bacterial accessory gene regulator (Agr) system, specifically the Agr-secreted \u03b1-haemolysin (Hla). Indeed, agr and hla mutants cannot trigger autophagy and are delivered to lysosomes, where they are degraded13,139. Interestingly, S. aureus infection decreased cellular cAMP levels and reduced the activity of the cAMP effector exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC; also known as RAPGEF3) and the downstream factor RAP2B140, suggesting that bacteria trigger autophagy by inhibiting the cellular cAMP\u2013EPAC\u2013RAP2B pathway. Notably, RAP2B is known to increase the levels of cytoplasmic calcium, which is required for the activation of calpains, a family of cysteine proteases that cleave ATG5 to generate a form of ATG5 that does not function in autophagy but instead is involved in apoptosis induction. Similarly, A. phagocytophilum grows in double-membrane vacuoles that are decorated with autophagy proteins, such as LC3 and BECN1 (Refs 12, 126). Autophagosome formation is nucleated by the bacterial T4SS secreted effector anaplasma translocated substrate 1, which directly binds BECN1 (Ref. 126). However, the autophagosomes do not acquire the late endosomal and lysosomal protein LAMP3, indicating that fusion with the lysosome is impaired. How bacteria block autophagosome maturation is unclear.",

At a later infection stage, rBCVs further convert into double- or multi-membrane autophagic BCVs (aBCVs), and this requires ULK1 and BECN1\u2013ATG14L\u2013PtdIns3KC3 activity but is independent of membrane elongation factors, including ATG12\u2013ATG5\u2013ATG16L1 and LC3\u2013PE131. At very late time points during infection, heavily infected cells release bacteria and cause re-infection of neighbouring cells, which generates infection foci. Approximately 80% of these infection foci have been shown to have aBCV-containing cells, and formation of infection foci depended on ULK1 or BECN1 expression as well as on aBCV formation131. Collectively, these results suggest that B. abortus hijacks some of the autophagy components to form the aBCV, which enables bacterial cell-to-cell spread. It was speculated that the aBCVs can promote the release of bacteria out of the cell, but further work is needed to clarify the possible mechanisms that are involved.",

Since these two seminal studies, there has been a flurry of research on antibacterial autophagy by microbiologists, cell biologists and immunologists. Notably, although bacteria can be targeted by autophagy, increasing evidence suggests that pathogenic bacteria have developed many ways of interfering with the host autophagy machinery. These include the use of virulence factors to camouflage the bacteria or to directly subvert autophagy signalling and/or autophagy proteins, thereby avoiding autophagy targeting. Bacterial factors can mimic modifiers of autophagy components to shut down their proper functions or directly bind and recruit autophagy proteins to the bacteria to favour their growth.",

Of note, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 1 (NOD1) and NOD2, which are cytosolic NOD-like receptors (NLRs) that detect peptidoglycans on intracellular pathogens, are involved in the induction of autophagy targeting of S. flexneri and L. monocytogenes by directly binding to ATG16L1 and recruiting it to the bacterial entry site on the plasma membrane141. It will be important to investigate whether other bacteria that can be sensed by NOD1 and NOD2 also trigger xenophagy by the same mechanism.

Typhimurium and GAS by interacting with ATG5 and WIPI2 (Ref. 142). However, it remains unknown how TECPR1 recognizes different bacteria. Moreover, TECPR1 only localizes to ubiquitin-negative bacteria142, suggesting that it mediates a ubiquitin-independent pathway. In addition, a recent study showed that human transmembrane protein 59 interacts with ATG16L1 via a 19-amino-acid-long motif143, thereby selectively targeting endosomes to autophagy. The same ATG16L1-binding motif was found in other proteins, suggesting that adaptor proteins that engage ATG16L1 could target other specific cargoes, such as bacteria, to autophagy.",

Typhimurium. The bacterium resides in a Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) after invading epithelial cells. Early after infection (\u223c1 hour), the membrane of a subset of SCVs is damaged and the bacterium is exposed to the cytoplasm, where it becomes associated with ubiquitylated proteins in a process that depends on the E3 ubiquitin ligase leucine-rich repeat and sterile \u03b1-motif-containing 1 (LRSAM1). Next, adaptor proteins, including p62, NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa) and optineurin (OPTN) are recruited to the SCV by binding to ubiquitin, and they recruit autophagosomes by interacting with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), ultimately resulting in autolysosome formation. The damaged SCV membrane also exposes \u03b2-glycans to the cytoplasm and recruits galectin 8 (GAL8), which binds to NDP52 and further recruits LC3. Also at \u223c1 hour post-infection, a subset of bacteria recruits diacylglycerol (DAG) to the undamaged SCVs. DAG activates protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4), which activates NADPH oxidase (NOX) and promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in turn inducing LC3-associated phagocytosis of bacteria. At \u223c4 hours post-infection, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is redistributed to the SCV membrane, which inhibits autophagy induction, resulting in autophagy escape and enabling bacteria to replicate in SCVs.

In addition, ATG5 binds VirG and targets bacteria to autophagosomes. T3SS, type 3 secretion system. \nPowerPoint slide\n",
