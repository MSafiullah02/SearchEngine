All population-related and medical resource datasets were collected in 2018; these were the most recent data that could be obtained. Figure 1 shows a map of cumulative cases by province. The number of cumulative cases is the sum of the newly confirmed cases from 16 January-06 February 2020. The largest number of cases was in Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital city. Figure 2 presents the population and population density (populaiton/km 2 ) for each province in 2018. Guangdong and Shanghai had the highest population and population density, respectively. Hubei ranked ninth in population and thirteenth in population density.

A value of 0 indicated that there was no spatial autocorrelation in the data. A positive Moran's I value indicated the clustering of similar values, whereas a negative Moran's I value indicated the clustering of dissimilar values. The larger the absolute Moran's I value, the stronger the spatial autocorrelation. The number of cases in this study was skewed, so the spatial dependency may not have been properly captured. Therefore, to adjust for the skewness, logarithmic transformation of the newly confirmed cases was used instead of the number of cases itself.

In Model 1, two provinces were considered adjacent if they shared a border. In Model 2, the distance between two provinces was used. In this case, the centroid for each province was determined using the gCentroid function in the rgeos package of statistical software R (Bivand et al., 2019) . Thined as the Euclidean distance between the centroids of these provinces. The extent to which the two provinces were adjacent was defined as the inverse of the distance. In Models 1 and 2, spatial adjacency was defined by geographical information, which is the usual method for examining spatial relationships. As COVID-19 is spread from person to person, population and population density were the key foci. Thus, Models 3 and 4 considered population and population density. The population (population density) for each province was ranked. A province was defined as adjacent to both the previous and following ranked provinces. Thus, the first-ranked and last-ranked provinces only had one adjacent neighbour. In terms of medical care resources, Models 5 and 6 considered the number of doctors and hospitals or medical centre beds. The definition of an adjacent neighbour was the same as that in Models 3 and 4. Moran's I function was used in the ape package of the statistical software R (Paradis et al., 2019) . The significance level of Moran's I test was 0.05. Figure 4 shows the time series plot of the newly confirmed cases for each day. The number of cases for each day was the sum of all cases in mainland China. As shown in Figure 4 , the number of cases increased almost exponentially.",

Over time, the cases spread to provinces neighbouring Hubei; the first-order neighbouring provinces showed a particularly increased number of confirmed cases after 22 January. Then, the second-order and third-order provinces showed a steeply increasing number of cases from 23 January and 24 January, respectively. This shows the spread of COVID-19. Eventually, the impact spread to all provinces in mainland China.",

            "text": "This study investigated the spatial dependency through Moran's I with different types of spatial connections. Except for the medical centre bed-based neighbourhood, a spatial clustering tendency was observed in every neighbourhood type from approximately 22 January. The regions connected by express trains to Wuhansuch as Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijinghad five, two and two confirmed cases, respectively on 21 January, the early stage of COVID-19 in China. This implies the possibility that COVID-19 had spread from Wuhan to other areas via the transportation (Zhao et al., 2020) . This possibility also supports the spatial dependency we detected in this study. On 23 January, the Chinese government closed off Wuhan City to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These findings could link with such a government policy. The results of the evaluation using geographical and distance-based neighbourhoods showed that COVID-19 is highly likely to spread between geographically adjacent regions. This may be because people in adjacent regions tend to interact with each other. In addition, Moran's I using population-based neighbourhoods also showed a strong spatial association. More people are likely to be infected with the virus in densely populated regions, which leads to the active spread of COVID-19 to other areas. Finally, having many doctors in a region indicates that the region can accommodate many severely ill patients, which can lead to the spread of the virus. This result is consistent with that of a previous study (Meng et al., 2005) . In addition, this study conducted the same spatial analysis using the ranks of the newly confirmed cases in a nonparametric approach because the data are quite skewed. The results were almost the same, except that there was a spatial association for a few more days.",

First, it used the reported dataset for the daily number of newly confirmed cases in the 31 provinces of China. This did not include the number of suspected cases, so it was difficult to understand the spatio-temporal transmission of COVID-19. However, it was important to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak at an early stage. Second, it considered six types of neighbourhoods; other types of neighbourhoods were not covered in this study, such as the urban-rural relationship, which might have also been significant (Meng et al., 2005) . Third, it only investigated spatial spread in mainland China. As infections have also occurred in other countries, investigating the global spatial spread of COVID-19 might be important to manage COVID-19.",
