            "text": "Protein-protein interaction is one of the most important mechanisms utilized by mammalian cells to regulate a variety of cellular and molecular activities, such as transcription, translation, signal transduction and enzyme reaction [1, 2]. Proteins of microorganisms also interfere with host cell proliferation and functions by interacting with intracellular proteins [3]. There are various methods to characterize protein-protein interactions including coimmunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry [4], chemical cross-linking [5], and the two-hybrid system [6, 7], which has been used widely in recent years because of its high-throughput screening capability and powerful ability of isolating unknown binding partners of a protein. The first two-hybrid system was yeast based and was introduced by Fields and Song in 1989 [8]. It is composed of two GAL-based transcription activation domains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one is the DNA binding domain (DBD) domain, while the other is the transcription activation domain (AD). To perform the two-hybrid analysis, an X gene is cloned into a two-hybrid vector fusing to DBD, with a Y gene cloned into another two-hybrid vector fused to the AD. If the X protein interacts with Y protein, the DBD and AD domains come into close proximity and form an active transcription activation complex (Fig. 22.1). The complex binds to and activates its cognate promoter sequence, which is linked to a reporter gene(s), such as Lac Z, or an essential nutrient [8]. These gene products generate distinctive phenotypes that can be easily recognized by a change of color of yeast colonies or a gained ability to grow in nutrient-deficient media.",

However, the yeast-based two-hybrid assay has its limitations. One major issue is that posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation in yeast can be quite different from that in mammalian cells. In addition, the intracellular milieu that supports the protein-protein interaction in yeast is different from that of mammalian cells [11, 12]. Therefore, when considering the study of interactions of proteins derived from mammalian cells, the yeast system may not be able to provide the optimal intracellular environment. To alleviate the pitfalls of the yeast two-hybrid system, the mammalian two-hybrid system was introduced.",

Two genes of interest (X and Y) are cloned into the vectors and fused with DBD and DA, correspondingly. The interaction of protein X to protein Y brings the DBD and AD to a close proximity and forms the transcriptional activation complex, which binds to the promoter of a reporter gene encoded in a reporter plasmid and starts the gene transcription. The reporter genes can be secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), chloramphenicol acetyl transferaseor (CAT), or luciferase [13\u201315]. GAL4 DNA binding domain and herpes virus DNA transcription activator VP16 are commonly used in mammalian two-hybrid systems [16].

            "text": "\nThe quality of DNA for transfection is very important, we recommend OD260/280 to be at least 1.5. The large scale DNA preparation should be aliquoted into several Eppendorf tubes and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C because frequent freeze-thaw cycles with the same tube may decrease the quality of DNA and affect the analysis.Sometimes the Gal or the VP16 fusion peptides in pM or pVP16 vectors affects the conformation of the targeted protein, it is recommended that pM-X + pVP16-Y, pM-Y, and pVP16-X are analyzed to avoid false negative results.Cells should be 50\u201370' confluent to allow optimal transcription and translation of the targeted gene.The combination of pM-X + pVP-X is recommended for analysis because many functional forms of proteins are dimers or multimers. In this case, X = Y. The constructs used in this chapter are SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein in pM and pVP16 vectors (X = Y).The transcription of pM and pVP16 vectors are controlled by a SV40 promoter, which is not as strong as the CMV promoter. Therefore, proteins expressed from these vectors may not be sufficient to perform Western blots or coimmunopre-cipitation analyses. Clontech provides another set of expression vectors for the analysis, that is, pCMV-myc and pCM-HA, driven by CMV promoter. Other CMV-based mammalian transcription vectors, such as pcDNA 3.1 can be considered for co-IP or Western blot analysis. Alternatively, there are mammalian two-hybrid vectors carrying CMV promoters, such as pCMX-Gal4-N and pCMX-VP16-N [17].If necessary, other methods should be considered to further confirm the result from the mammalian two-hybrid results. These methods are, but not limited to, GST-pull down assay, fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) or biolu-minescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), and mass spectrometry.When pG5SEAP vector alone is used as a negative control, it tends to give high chemiluminescence readings, because no other vector competes for the transfection reagent. When this happens, a \u201cfiller\u201d vector (i.e., pcDNA 3.1) that is not related to the mammalian two-hybrid system is recommended (i.e., 800 ng pCDNA 3.1 - 200 ng pG5SEAP).The p53 protein and simian virus large T antigen have very high interaction kinetics. Such positive control included in the mammalian two-hybrid system may yield very high chemiluminescence reading, thereby obscuring the levels of the targeted protein-protein interactions that otherwise would be easily detected as positive reaction. It is recommended that this positive control be used merely to check if the transfection and SEAP assay are successful instead of comparing with the readings from the targeted protein-protein interactions.The chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assay is recommended by some manufacturers; however, in some cases, it is not as sensitive as the SEAP assay. The difference of sensitivity level can be more than tenfold.Since mammalian two-hybrid system demonstrates levels of interactions, it can be used for interaction motif mapping. The commonly used mapping methods are sequential deletions or expression of gene fragments. When the sequential deletion method is used, it is recommended to do both amino- and carboxy-terminal sequential deletion so that functional domains can be better defined.\n",
