One, designated MAb-CC1, prevented binding of MHV-A59 to murine fibroblasts and blocked infection of mouse cell lines with MHV-A59 [9] and with four other prototype MHV strains (unpublished data) that do not cross-neutralize [10] . Specificity of MAb-CC1 inhibition of MHV infection was supported by the fact that titers of vesicular stomatitis (Indiana serotype), Sendai, and Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis viruses were identical in mock-treated and MAb-CC1-treated MHVsusceptible NCTC 1469 cells (data not shown). Further evidence that MAb-CC1 was an MHV receptor-specific antibody was derived from the fact that an MAb-CC1 affinity-purified 110-to 120-kDa protein eluted after preparative SDS-PAGE specifically bound MHV-A59 in VOPBA [9] . Thus, we sought to determine whether MAb-CC1 modulated the course of MHV-A59 infection in the natural host exposed by a presumed natural route.",

Briefly, spleen cells from receptor-negative SJL mice that had been immunized with intestinal brush border membranes from MHV-susceptible BALB/c mice were fused with SP2-0 myeloma cells [9] . MAbs specific for the MHV receptor were selected by reactivity in an ELISA with receptor eluted after preparative SDS-PAGEofBALB/c brush border membranes and by reactivity in immunoblots with BALB/c, but not SJL, brush border membranes [9] .

Therefore, nose, brain, and liver were chosen as indicators of the effect of MAb-CCl treatment on MHV-A59 infection. The proportion ofMHV-A59-inoculated mice from which virus could be recovered was lower for MAb-CC1-treated mice in all cases (table 1), with statistically significant differences for brain and liver on day 2 after viral inoculation. Although nasal tissue from most PBS-and MAb- CC1-treated infected mice contained virus on days 2 and 3 after inoculation, viral titers were >lOOO-foldlower in noses of MAb-CC1-treated mice (figure 1). Viral titers on days 2 and 3 were also lower in brains and livers of infected mice treated with MAb-CC1, with statistically significant differences in brain titers on both days. The relatively high viral titer shown for liver in the MAb-CCl treatment group on day 2 represents only a single mouse from which virus could be recovered. The mean viral titer in the livers of MAb-CC1-treated mice at 3 days after viral exposure was 2.6 10glO/g lower than the mean titer in livers of buffer-treated mice; however, this was not statistically significant, primarily due to the small number of surviving buffer-treated infected mice.",

After oronasal exposure of infant mice, both inocula induced fatal disease with qualitatively similar lesions in the same spectrum of organs (data not shown). This finding suggests that virus recovered from organs of MAb-CCl-treated mice did not represent a selected variant population. Further studies are required to determine if complete protection from viral infection can be afforded by challenge with a lower dose of virus or by administration of more concentrated antireceptor antibody or more frequent administration ofthe antibody. However, a relatively small amount of anti-receptor antibody yielded a protective effect against an overwhelming inoculum of MHV-A59 administered by a natural route.",

A possible complication of this approach is that the normal cellular function of the receptor for MHV is unknown. Blocking of the receptor by antibody could interfere with its function(s). However, these experiments are promising in that no adverse effects of treatment with MAb-CCI were observed in vitro (unpublished data) or in vivo. Possibly the virus-binding domain of the MHV receptor glycoprotein differs from the domain for host cell function(s), Evidence for this hypothesis stems from the observation of a homologous protein antigenically related to the BALB/c 110to l20-kDa MHV receptor on SJL intestinal and hepatocyte membranes; however, the SJL protein fails to bind MHV-A59 or MAb-CCl [9] .",

Human coronaviruses, like those of the mouse, are ubiquitous, and identification of the host cell receptor(s) for these agents will have a significant impact on human health. Human coronaviruses commonly cause respiratory infections and account for f\\J15 %of colds [14] . The remaining 85 % of colds are predominantly caused by rhinoviruses [15] . Vaccines against rhinoviruses have not proved practicable because there are >100 serotypes in the genus; however, drugs targeted against the receptors for rhinoviruses might prove useful since there are only two receptors for all of the serotypes [3] . Nose drops containing antibody against the receptor for the major group of rhinoviruses did not reduce the overall infection or illness rates among challenged human volunteers but reduced viral titers and delayed viral shedding [4] . Soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-I has recently been shown to inhibit binding of rhinovirus to cultured cells and to protect against cytopathic effect induced by picornaviruses that use the major group rhinovirus receptor [5] . Our studies suggest that a receptor-targeted approach to preventing coronavirus infection is worthy of further study. Ifthe receptor for human coronaviruses is homologous to the glycoprotein receptor for murine coronavirus, oronasal treatment with a receptor-targeted ligand might also be a useful approach to prevention of human coronavirus infections.",

The frequency of developing neutralizing antibody to IFN varied according to the IFN given. Particularly, the seroconversion frequency was significantly higher in patients treated with recombinant IFN-a2a (20.2%) than in patients treated with either recombinant IFN-a2b (69%) or IFN-aNl (1.2%), a lymphoblastoid IFN-a. Furthermore, sera obtained from patients treated with either recombinant IFN neutralized both types of recombinant IFNs but failed to neutralize IFN-aNl.",
