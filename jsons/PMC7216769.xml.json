On December 31,\n2019, China informed the World Health Organization (WHO), and the world took notice for the\nfirst time. While the Chinese government began to take restrictive actions to curb the\nspread of the virus, most people in the rest of the world did not comprehend then that this\ndisease would change our daily lives as we know it. One might compare the onset of the\nCOVID-19 outbreak with a looming storm and our inability to predict the extent of the\nstorm\u2019s severity despite available data. Four months later, by the time this Review\nwas written, COVID-19 was rapidly spreading out of control with alarming death rates\nworldwide. The outbreak has led to a global health and economic crisis with countries\nclosing their borders and issuing travel bans, shuttering their schools and businesses,\nimposing strict quarantines, and more. In short, COVID-19 has posed severe economic strain\non the world\u2019s economy. Furthermore, life-saving supplies and hospital beds are\nalready limiting in most countries. What causes COVID-19, and why is this outbreak so\ndifferent from other outbreaks such as SARS and MERS? In addition, why is the COVID-19\ndisease so difficult to contain?",

How can a bat virus evolve into a human pathogen that creates a\ndisease of such global dimensions? The answer to this question lies in a characteristic\nviral feature, the rapid viral genome mutation rate which then results in a variety of\nviral descendants with altered proteins responsible for attaching to and entering host\ncells of different animal species, including humans. RNA viruses such as the coronaviruses\nexhibit especially high mutation rates that allow rapid diversification at the cost of\ngenerating nonviable descendants.27 Viral adaptation to new hosts is\ndriven entirely by stochastic mutations and a stochastic, hit or miss host encounter.\nExpanding a viral host range creates additional reservoirs and is thus of evolutionary\nadvantage to the virus. The spike protein is an important target for evolutionary changes\nas it allows recognition of different host cell target proteins, not only between\ndifferent host species but also between different tissues within one host\n(tropism).28 Dispersion as aerosolized particles to different species\nis especially efficient in creating new reservoirs of animals by mutated coronaviruses\nthat can eventually reach a human host. As the virus is spreading across the world, it has\nalready begun to mutate leaving a possibility for a recurrence of a SARS-CoV-2\nvariant.29,30 More\nresearch will reveal the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants on host range and\ntropism.",

Often\nperidomestic animals or wildlife serves as intermediate stable reservoirs increasing the\nopportunity of the virus to inadvertently infect humans.31\u221233 For MERS, camels were suggested as the intermediate reservoir.34 COVID-19 spread from a Chinese seafood marketplace also selling live\nchicken and rabbits,33 and SARS is thought to have originated from palm\ncivets, exotic cats sold at Chinese marketplaces.35 The exact\nintermediary animal for both SARS coronaviruses will become known once more viral\nsequences from various animal sources become available. This raises the question whether\nCOVID-19 could spread from humans to domestic animals including pets and eventually\nwildlife, thus creating new reservoirs in countries without previous animal reservoirs. As\nof recently, there is evidence of inadvertent human to dog and cat (domestic and tiger)\ntransmission of SARS-CoV-2.36 In laboratory settings, cats as well as\nferrets were also able to transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to their kind suggesting that cats\nand ferrets represent at least two new potential animal reservoirs in countries outside\nChina. More research will examine whether either animal species can transmit the virus\nback to humans.",

It is expressed as ID50 and\nrefers to the number of pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, that is sufficient to\ninfect 50% of a given susceptible population. Some pathogens have lower infectious doses\nthan others. For influenza, a high infectious dose appears to correlate with a more severe\ndisease.41 The infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 is currently not known.\nA study by Watabanbe et al. used animal studies and modeling of SARS spreading in an\napartment complex in China to estimate the infectious dose for SARS-Cov-1 to be 280 viral\nparticles to cause disease in 50% of the population.42 This\nID50 is similar to values determined for the human common cold coronaviruses\nand some animal coronaviruses belonging to the same genetic group as SARS-CoV-1.42 Exact infectious dose estimations for human pathogens are difficult to\nobtain since human volunteer studies are rare. One such study for the Influenza A virus\ndetermined the ID50 to be 790 viral particles when administered intranasally.\nHowever, infection via aerosolization of Influenza A is believed to be much lower.43 This suggests that the infectious doses for the human coronaviruses and\nInfluenza A are in about the same range. In contrast, the ID50 of\nMycobacterium tuberculosis is 10 bacteria by inhalation, which is far\nlower. How many SARS-CoV-2 viruses are expelled when people cough? The answer to this\nquestion is not yet known. However, viral shedding from the respiratory tract begins 2.5\ndays before the onset of symptoms and peaks already 0.6 day, on the average,\nbefore the onset of symptoms.44 The authors\nspeculate that 44% of transmission could already occur before people become aware of\ncarrying the disease. Presymptomatic virus shedding is thus likely a major contributor to\nglobal COVID-19 spreading as it occurs undetected under the current limited testing\npractice. In contrast, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV virus shedding from the respiratory tract\nbegins at the onset of symptoms, and infectivity is greatest in the second week of\nillness.45,46 Thus,\nboth of these diseases are easier to trace.",

The basic reproduction number (R0\nor R naught) determines the severity of an epidemic. It indicates the average number of\npeople that will be infected by a single person (\u201cThe Source\u201d). Measles and\npertussis (whooping cough) have an R0 of around 15 meaning one person can transmit the\ndisease to an average of 15 other persons in a population that has not developed any\nimmunity or has not been vaccinated. It is worth noting that both diseases are spread via\nairborne transmission. R0 is also a useful measure for explaining how a new, emerging\ndisease spreads in a vulnerable population. If R0 is less than 1 the disease will die out,\nif it is equal to one the disease will remain stable in a population, and if it is greater\nthan 1 it can cause an outbreak or epidemic. Based on data from early transmission of\nCOVID-19 in an unprotected population in Wuhan, the average R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was\nestimated to be 2.247 but other studies suggest a higher R0\nvalue.48 A more recent analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak in China\nduring the same time period, using mathematical modeling and including high-resolution\ndomestic travel and infection data, determined R0 for SARS-CoV-2 to be 5.7.49 This makes COVID-19 a far more contagious disease compared to SARS and\nMERS. The R0 value for SARS-CoV-1 was estimated to be 3.050 and for\nMERS-CoV 0.45.51 Seasonal flu, for which herd immunity exists, has an\nR0 of 1.3. What are the practical implications of R0 values? The higher the R0 value, the\nfaster a disease spreads through the population as the spread is exponential (Figure 2). Once the population approaches saturation,\nthat is, everyone is diseased, the spread levels off. Social distancing can reduce R0 by\nlowering the probability of person-to-person transmission. Since individuals already shed\nSARS-CoV-19 viruses before becoming symptomatic, wearing masks to create a barrier and\nretain droplets should potentially also lower R0. Once vaccines become available, R0 can\nlikely be decreased effectively.",

A businessman returning from the Middle East was\ntreated at a hospital from which the disease was spread to other hospitals to which\npatients were transferred where MERS then became a nosocomial disease (that is, a disease\noriginating in a hospital).

It plays a significant role in assessing the severity of a\ndisease. The case fatality ratio of COVID-19 was estimated to be 5.6% in China and 15.2%\noutside of China.59 The high percentage of deaths was speculated to be\ndue to the breakdown of the healthcare system, i.e., their inability to optimally treat\nseriously ill patients.60 Furthermore, incomplete testing could\ncontribute to high CFRs if the population of COVID-19 infected individuals is\nsubstantially larger than the cases confirmed by laboratory testing. Using the WHO\nestimate calculated from the ratio of death cases per total laboratory-confirmed positive\ncases, the CFR for COVID-19 is estimated worldwide to be 7.0% (as of 4/22/2020), which\ncompares with 11% for SARS and 34% for MERS (Table 1). Analysis of the current CFRs by country illuminates significant differences\nin CFR (Figure 3A). Certain countries such as\nFrance, UK, Italy, Sweden, and Spain have substantially higher CFRs than other countries.\nIn addition, CFRs in one country can increase over time (Figure 3B). Factors underlying high CFRs are under investigation, but the\navailability of an effective healthcare system may play a major role in curtailing the CFR\nwithin a country. This can occur when the total number of cases increases sufficiently to\noverwhelm the available hospital capacities for critical care. In particular, countries\nwith less developed healthcare structures will be expected to have high CFRs. In a global\npandemic, other communities/countries need to step up in order to provide critical\nlife-saving support.",

While this paper\nis not meant to detail all appropriate administrative controls needed for public health\nduring a disease outbreak, two points should be emphasized. First, in the context of\nemerging diseases, administrative controls must optimally be put into place in\nanticipation of an outbreak or a pandemic rather than after a disease has already become\nestablished. Lessons learned from the SARS pandemic provide ample information for helping\ndesign administrative controls leaving sufficient flexibility for adaptation to different\npathogens and regional needs.2 Second, the importance of personnel\ntraining cannot be emphasized enough. Even if sufficient PPE is available it becomes\nuseless if personnel are not trained in proper donning and doffing procedures. Improper\nPPE use was likely a contributing factor in superspreading hospital events during the SARS\nand MERS outbreaks.51,69 In the 2003 SARS epidemic 20.5% of all healthcare providers treating\nSARS patients in Hong Kong hospitals became infected, and 36.7% in a Canadian hospital\nepisode.69 The incorrect removal of PPE, for example, gloves, not\nonly endangers hospital personnel and first responders and their patients but also plays a\nrole in spreading disease in other facilities such as nursing homes, airports, and grocery\nstores. Thus, instead of offering protection, PPE without guided training can instill a\nfalse sense of security and accomplish the opposite, the expansion of an outbreak.",

The most commonly used\ndiagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 is done by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain\nreaction). Briefly, viral RNA is first purified from samples, transcribed into DNA which is\nthen amplified in a PCR reaction to achieve easily detectable amounts. In the laboratory,\nthe RNA isolation and the RT-PCR reaction and analysis can be automated, processing 100 or\nmore samples at a time on one machine with a turnaround time of a few hours. Multiply that\nby several machines per lab and many laboratories per country and, theoretically, this\nshould provide hundreds of thousands of tests per day. But that is not what the current\nreality looks like. At this time, COVID-19 test availability is limited, and it often takes\ndays to obtain results. What is limiting testing, and why does it take so long to get\nresults? Before answering these questions, let us ask how other countries solve this\nproblem. Recall the images of drive-by testing stations in South Korea? Healthcare personnel\nfully protected by appropriate PPE (Tyvek suits, respirators, eye or face protection, and\ngloves) took swabs and personal information from concerned citizens who could then expect\nthe result via text or email message the next day. The testing procedure in South Korea and\nelsewhere currently relies on the same type of RT-PCR assay. Some countries such as South\nKorea have more test reagents available to them than other countries because they already\nproduced them and rapidly increased production as soon as they learned of the emergence of\nCOVID-19.73 Other countries had to import them.73 As\nmore and more countries dealt with increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, the supply of\nswabs, test reagents, other laboratory supplies, and PPE became limited, and the ability to\ntest for COVID-19 was disrupted. Some companies are already working on offering tests that\ncombine the RNA purification and RT-PCR procedures into one step that can be accomplished by\na small portable machine. These quick tests reduce testing time and allow for personalized\ntesting by medical offices affording the price. An effective response to an outbreak would\nbe to ramp up production of all needed materials as soon as there is a threat of a potential\npandemic.",

Such\nantibody tests are available to detect SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in the serum of previously\ninfected patients. Antibody tests are effective weeks to months to years after an infection\ndepending on the immunity to a given pathogen. They are useful to survey the spread of a\ndisease and provide insight into the scale of an outbreak. The test may also be effective in\nscreening for nonsymptomatic carriers that could be part of a yet unknown transmission chain\nduring an outbreak. Finally, they can be used after the crisis phase passes to better\nmeasure the true infection rate. The antigen test works similarly except that antibodies\ngenerated against a pathogen are used to directly detect this pathogen in the serum or other\nbodily fluids of infected patients. Like RT-PCR, this test is a diagnostic test but is less\nsensitive than the RT-PCR test and is generally applied several days after a patient becomes\nsymptomatic. However, the antigen test is generally less expensive than RT-PCR, administered\nmore conveniently, and has a fast turnaround time.",
