The long incubation period between infection and symptomatic disease (15\u201350 d) also contributes to difficulties in accurately identifying foodborne sources of hepatitis A virus infection (Fiore, 2004).

In addition, viruses of the H5, H7 and H9 sub-types have been found to cause sporadic human infections (Peiris et al., 1999; Shortridge et al., 2000;\nKoopmans et al., 2004). The subtype of recent worldwide concern is the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus (Abdel-Ghafar et al., 2008). This particular avian influenza virus sub-type has been detected in poultry from over 50 countries on three continents (Van Reeth, 2007). It has infected humans in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, China, Turkey, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Egypt and Djibouti (de Jong and Hien, 2006). This virus replicates to abnormally high levels in the upper respiratory tract, causing an intense inflammatory response and an extremely high case fatality rate of over 60 % (de Jong et al., 2006). The H5N1 avian influenza virus currently has a limited ability to spread from person to person. However, there is concern that this virus could acquire the ability to spread effectively in humans, leading to a worldwide pandemic (Rajagopal and Treanor, 2007). The Spanish influenza pandemic, which killed approximately 50 million people worldwide is thought to have arisen from an avian H1N1 strain (Rajagopal and Treanor, 2007).",

The positive-sense, 30 kb genome codes directly for viral proteins (Fauqu et al., 2005). These viruses typically cause mild respiratory disease; however, a particularly virulent strain known as the Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2003 and caused over 8000 cases, with a nearly 10 % case fatality rate (Wang and Chang, 2004). This virus caused systematic infections as well as respiratory illness, and was identified in the digestive tract, as well as in faeces and sewage (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003; Zhang, 2003; Wang et al., 2005). This raises the possibility that the virus may have had the potential to spread through the faecal\u2013oral route and food products. Although these viruses are able to persist for days in some buffered media, they are sensitive to heating, UV light and disinfection (Duan et al., 2003; Rabenau et al., 2005a, Rabenau et al., 2005b). No cases of foodborne spread were documented during this outbreak, although one cluster of cases in a housing complex was linked to an index patient suffering from diahrroea (McKinney et al., 2006).",

The hepatitis A virus survives for up to one month in dried faecal matter (McCaustland et al., 1982). In mixtures of human and animal waste designed for waste treatment prior to disposal, it takes 7 d to reduce viral titre by 1 log10 at 37 \u00b0C (Deng and Cliver, 1995). Once introduced into the water environment, the hepatitis A virus also remains infectious for months, associating with marine sediment (Arnal et al., 1998; Bosch, 1998). The hepatitis A virus has been shown experimentally to accumulate in mussels and oysters, and depuration is not effective at eliminating the virus from the shellfish tissue (Franco et al., 1990; Enriquez et al., 1992; Abad et al., 1997b; De Medici et al., 2001; Kingsley and Richards, 2003).

In these reports, the human fecal contamination might have been introduced during produce growth (Amon et al., 2005), harvest (Calder et al., 2003), processing (Frank et al., 2007) or distribution. Consequently, the point of viral contamination can be difficult to identify (Hutin et al., 1999; Dentinger et al., 2001; CDC, 2003b; Howitz et al., 2005; Wheeler et al., 2005; Tekeuchi et al., 2006). Once fresh produce is contaminated, the hepatitis A virus adsorbs to its surface and persists for days (Croci et al., 2002; Stine et al., 2005). Freezing allows the virus to survive for months to years (Niu et al., 1992). In addition, washing the contaminated produce does not usually substantially reduce the level of contamination (Croci et al., 2002).",

Heating is an effective mode of viral inactivation, but higher temperatures than those generally used to reduce bacterial counts are required (Parry and Mortimer, 1984). Protection of the virus is also conferred by food matrices, and longer times and/or higher temperatures are required to completely inactivate the virus (Croci et al., 1999; Bidawid et al., 2000d; Deboosere et al., 2004). For example, increasing the fat content (Bidawid et al., 2000d) or the sucrose concentration (Deboosere et al., 2004) of food preparations has been shown to increase the heat resistance of the virus. This may be due to a general effect of decreasing the water activity, but this possibility has not been systematically addressed. The result is that many traditional heat-inactivation or cooking protocols, such as pasteurization, steaming or baking, are insufficient to ensure the safety of hepatitis A-contaminated foods (Bidawid et al., 2000d; Croci et al., 2005; Hewitt and Greening, 2006).",

Surface decontamination may be possible using targeted applications. Alternative physical inactivation methods show some promise for the inactivation of hepatitis A in food products. The virus is sensitive to UV light, but the light must access viral particles to inactivate them, which makes the technique difficult to apply to most food products (Nuanualsuwan et al., 2002). High hydrostatic pressure is a newer technique that has the potential to inactivate the hepatitis A virus in food products while maintaining the organoleptic properties of raw products, particularly shellfish. The technique shows promise for the inactivation of hepatitis A virus in buffer, oysters, strawberries and green onions, although high pressure may reduce the palatability of fresh fruits and vegetables (Kingsley et al., 2002, 2005; Calci et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The hepatitis E virus is known to infect a wide range of animal species (Goens and Perdue, 2004; Vasickova et al., 2007). Most of the studies and evidence for zoonotic transmission to humans have focused on strains isolated from swine (Goens and Perdue, 2004). Studies have shown that these strains are very closely related to the human viruses and that they productively infect primates (Meng et al., 1997, 1998). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that swine viruses are more closely related to their human counterparts within a country than to other swine isolates around the world (Meng et al., 1997; Hsieh et al., 1999; van der Poel et al., 2001; Pei and Yoo, 2002; Nishizawa et al., 2003; Banks et al., 2004). Zoonotic transmission of this virus to the human population has been postulated to occur through the consumption of raw or lightly cooked meat from a naturally infected animal (Teo, 2006; Vasickova et al., 2007). The evidence for this is strong in a few cases in Japan, but weak elsewhere (Matsuda et al., 2003; Tei et al., 2003). However, infectious hepatitis E virus and/or viral RNA has been isolated from commercial pig livers in the USA, the Netherlands and Japan, indicating that this is a possible transmission route (Yazaki et al., 2003; Bouwknegt et al., 2007; Feagins et al., 2007).",

As such, the pH stability of this virus has yet to be formally demonstrated. The capsid protein acquires an increased heat stability at low pH, and the virus is known to infect via the gastrointestinal tract, implying some resistance to acidic conditions (Zafrullah et al., 2004). The virus resists inactivation by heating at 56 \u00b0C, but heating to 71 \u00b0C completely inactivated the virus in naturally-contaminated pig livers (Emerson et al., 2005; Feagins et al., 2008). Other physical and chemical methods of inactivation have not been tested, although an outbreak linked to chlorinated drinking water indicates that free chlorine residuals known to reduce fecal coliforms are not sufficient to inactivate the hepatitis E virus (Guthmann et al., 2006).",

The widespread use of the oral polio vaccine, which confers intestinal immunity, has led to the eradication of the virus from three of the six regions of the world as defined by the WHO (Sabin, 1991; Lahariya, 2007). These three regions are: the Americas, representing 35 countries, polio-free since 1994; the Western Pacific, representing 37 countries and territories, polio-free since 2000; and the European, representing 51 countries, polio-free since 2002 (CDC, 1994, CDC, 2001, CDC, 2002). The disease is still endemic in Afganistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan (Lahariya, 2007). In recent years, there have also been other countries within the WHO regions of Africa, South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean that have experienced outbreaks of poliomyelitis caused by both wild and vaccine-derived strains (Melnick, 1996; Chumakov et al., 2007). Due to the prevalence of asymptomatic disease, the absence of poliomyelitis does not always correlate with the absence of the poliovirus, and intensive vaccination campaigns are still warranted (Chumakov et al., 2007). Individuals in polio-free countries still routinely follow a course of vaccination with the killed vaccine (Wood et al., 2000, Wood et al., 2006).",

However, once the environment is contaminated, the poliovirus survives for weeks to months in groundwater (Yates et al., 1985; Gordon and Toze, 2003) and in soil (Yeager and O\u2019Brien, 1979; Hurst et al., 1980).

For example, although a model system exists for the study of inactivation kinetics, wild-type isolates of the hepatitis A virus grow very slowly, if at all, in culture and accumulate many mutations during this process (Cromeans et al., 1987; Konduru and Kaplan, 2006).

Molecular techniques also have the advantage that they provide information on the genotype of the strains involved in outbreaks (Nainan et al., 2006). This information can be useful in establishing an epidemiological link between cases of foodborne illness (Hutin et al., 1999). Microarrays are also being developed that could provide genotyping without the need for sequencing amplicons (Pagotto et al., 2008).

Changing pH can be used to concentrate enteroviruses from oysters (Sobsey et al., 1975). At low pH, virus adsorbs to shellfish tissue and can be concentrated by centrifugation. At high pH, the virus is eluted from the tissue. Ultrafiltration or ultracentrifugation are then able to concentrate the viral particles in solution. The main disadvantage of this type of system is that many contaminants remain in solution with the extracted virus and may interfere with downstream detection by either cell culture or molecular methods (Speirs et al., 1987). Additional concentration steps using organic flocculation or polyethylene glycol precipitation can improve the detection efficiency (Traore et al., 1998). Extremely sensitive detection is obtained by lysing the viral particles with a phenol-guanidinium chloride reagent and purifying the genome using magnetic poly(dT) beads (Kingsley and Richards, 2001). This method has been standardized and published in the Health Canada Compendium of Analytical Methods for the microbiological analysis of potentially contaminated shellfish (Trottier et al., 2006).",

Methods for viral isolation from fruits and vegetables employ washes or elution from the food surface, because homogenization releases many inhibitors of molecular reactions (Sanchez et al., 2007). Methods have been developed mainly for leafy greens, green onions and berries using a variety of concentration procedures (Bidawid et al., 2000c; Shan et al., 2005; Guevremont et al., 2006; Rzezutka et al., 2006; Butot et al., 2007; Papafragkou et al., 2008). Polyethylene glycol precipitation (Guevremont et al., 2006), immunomagnetic concentration (Bidawid et al., 2000c; Shan et al., 2005), charge-based concentration (Bidawid et al., 2000c; Papafragkou et al., 2008), ultracentrifugation (Rzezutka et al., 2006) and ultrafiltration (Butot et al., 2007) have all been reported to be useful for the isolation of virus particles from fruits and vegetables. For example, positively charged beads circulated and captured using the Pathatrix\u2122 machinery yield detection limits below one plaque forming unit of the hepatitis A virus in some artificially-inoculated samples (Papafragkou et al., 2008). In most cases, the choice of the method used is based on the reagents available to the testing laboratory, and the use of internal controls is not consistent. This is a concern because of the potential release of inhibitory compounds and should be addressed in future studies (Sanchez et al., 2007).",

The advent of molecular methods has reduced the time and cost required for detecting viruses from water samples (Pillai, 1997). These new methods have successfully been used to detect viral genomes or genome fragments in many types of raw and treated water samples (Kittigul et al., 2000; Albinana-Gimenez et al., 2006). It has, however, been demonstrated that viral genome fragments (non-viable) are detected after wastewater treatment protocols that eliminate infectious virus (Simonet and Gantzer, 2006). This raises concerns that the presence of genome fragments from enterically infecting viruses may not accurately predict the level of infectious virus in water samples.",

The most effective approach to prevent shellfish contamination is to prevent human sewage from entering shellfish growing waters. This sounds straightforward, but its enforcement can be difficult, particularly in remote areas with both commercial and recreational boat traffic. Imposing monetary penalties for waste dumping, mandating the use of waste containers that cannot easily be dumped overboard, and developing education outreach programs are three strategies with the potential to limit hepatitis A contamination of shellfish (Papafragkou et al., 2006). If waters are contaminated, depuration can be used to reduce the levels of hepatitis A virus in shellfish prior to harvest, but viruses in shellfish tissue are purged more slowly than bacteria, and the hepatitis A virus in particular is not as readily depurated as other viruses (Richards, 2001; Chironna et al., 2002). Unfortunately, current routine testing procedures do not look for viral contaminants in growing waters, and it has been repeatedly shown that the traditional bacterial indicators are not indicative of hepatitis A virus contamination (Croci et al., 2000; Muniain-Mujika et al., 2003; Pusch et al., 2005; Phanuwan et al., 2006; Villar et al., 2007).",

Although treatment regimens are available to allow the reuse of wastewater for irrigation, they are not necessarily effective against the hepatitis A virus (Gantzer et al., 1998; Skraber et al., 2007). Further research is necessary into the effectiveness of various water treatment protocols to determine if they are appropriate for the control of hepatitis A virus contamination. Produce is also sensitive to contamination introduced by human handling during harvest. Control procedures at this stage should include provision of toilet and hand-washing facilities, education on hygienic practices, reporting of active illnesses and provision of childcare so that young children, a prominent source of asymptomatic hepatitis A infections, are not present in the fields (Fiore, 2004; Koopmans and Duizer, 2004).",

These are more stringent procedures than those necessary to reduce most bacterial contamination, and must be implemented properly in order to be effective. Cooking will inactivate the hepatitis A virus, but the entire product must reach 85 \u00b0C to ensure viral reduction (Parry and Mortimer, 1984). This is not suitable for fresh produce, and new technology must be developed to inactivate the virus in these products. Categories of food matrices must be individually tested to develop protocols that adequately reduce hepatitis A titre (Croci et al., 1999; Bidawid et al., 2000d; Deboosere et al., 2004). The use of UV light and high hydrostatic pressure are promising, but their effectiveness must be further investigated before they will be useful for routine decontamination procedures (Nuanualsuwan et al., 2002; Kingsley et al., 2006). Gamma irradiation is somewhat effective at reducing hepatitis A titre on lettuce and strawberries, but the dose for a 1 log reduction is approximately 3 kGy (Bidawid et al., 2000b), while current regulations in the USA only allow doses up to 1 kGy for fresh foods (CFSAN, 2007).",

Contamination may be introduced during the final preparation stages for ready-to-eat foods (Greig et al., 2007; Todd et al., 2007a, Todd et al., 2007b). The hepatitis A virus is excreted for up to two weeks prior to the development of symptoms (Fiore, 2004). It is therefore important to stress proper hygiene and hand-washing practices for all food service workers. Proper hand-washing with soap and water has been shown to be more effective at removing hepatitis A virus from hands than ethanol-based hand rubs (Mbithi et al., 1993; Bidawid et al., 2000a). Educational programs for food service workers must be designed with care to ensure the correct message is communicated. For example, gloved hands are frequently viewed as safer for food handling than bare skin, but care must still be taken to avoid cross-contamination of foods or surfaces. Preliminary data from our laboratory indicates that contaminated gloves spread virus very effectively (Bidawid et al., 2007). Effective surface decontamination can also be used to interrupt hepatitis A virus transmission in food service settings, but as described in Section 25.3.1, not all commercial disinfectants are effective against the hepatitis A virus (Mbithi et al., 1990; Abad et al., 1997a; Bidawid et al., 2000a; van Engelenburg et al., 2002; Jean et al., 2003; Bigliardi and Sansebastiano, 2006; Terpstra et al., 2007). For effective disinfectants, such as sodium hypochlorite, concentration and contact time must be followed precisely to effectively inactivate the virus on a contaminated surface (Grabow et al., 1983; Mbithi et al., 1990; Abad et al., 1997a; Jean et al., 2003).",

The infection is endemic in many swine populations that have been examined, but does not cause overt disease. As a result, there is no incentive for control measures to improve animal health (Goens and Perdue, 2004). If the link between infected animals and transmission to humans can be established outside of Japan, this might provide a rationale for the development of animal-specific prevention strategies. At this time, however, the most effective control measure against infection is thorough cooking of meats and organ meats prior to consumption (Feagins et al., 2008). Because of the low rates of person-to-person transmission in documented outbreaks, transmission via food handlers and ready-to-eat foods is not expected to be a major source of infection (Hla et al., 1985; Somani et al., 2003).",

Depuration of shellfish greatly reduces the risk of poliovirus transmission by this route, and proper hand-washing by food handlers interrupts the chain of transmission during final preparation of foods (Schurmann and Eggers, 1985; Franco et al., 1990; Enriquez et al., 1992).

            "text": "In addition to public health measures, the food production and processing industries can take action to reduce the spread of viruses through food. A recurring point in the above discussion is the remarkable resistance of viruses to decontamination procedures. Heating and disinfection protocols for viruses and food preparation surfaces are being defined in the literature, but they must also be recognized and implemented along the food production continuum. In addition, these viruses typically have a very low infectious dose (10\u2013100 particles) and they can be excreted at high levels (106\u20131011 particles per gram of faeces). Since contamination of food products is typically a secondary event, a 5 log reduction in infectious particles has been considered effective for control. The recent development of sensitive and semi-quantitative detection methods will help to identify the critical control points along the food production and preparation continuum where virus contamination can be reduced. Unfortunately, many of these methods detect viral genomes instead of infectious virus particles. The regulation of viruses in foods will require a more detailed understanding of the correlation between the presence of viral nucleic acid fragments and a human health risk.",
