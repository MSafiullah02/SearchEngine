Since the turn of the century, China has been a source of numerous infectious disease outbreaks. It is also the origin of the MCR-1 gene, which confers resistance to colistin, a \"last-line\" antibiotic deployed against multidrug-resistant infections. With the largest population in the world, coupled with its status as a major supplier of agricultural produce, evaluating Chinese responses to AMR is critical to understanding the efficacy of the global response. Drawing on knowledge of both Chinese politics and health security, this article analyzes how Chinese actors have responded to the threat in the public and animal health sectors as well as the domestic and international implications of these responses. Based on interviews with key Chinese and international officials, scientists, and public health specialists, as well as farmers and consumers, we argue that the securitization of AMR in China is currently more concerned with domestic policy and resource competition than with addressing the existential health threat. Without a greater alignment of AMR strategies within China, macrosecuritizing efforts to address the threat globally cannot succeed.",

Although the threat posed by resistance to antibiotics is almost as old as their use, it is only now that AMR is garnering global attention. The World Health Organization's (WHO) first global report on AMR surveillance (World Health Organization 2014, IX) summarized the scope of the threat, stating that, \"A post-antibiotic era-in which common infections and minor injuries can kill-far from being an apocalyptic fantasy, is instead a very real possibility for the 21 st Century.\" Unlike other newly emergent diseases-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Influenza A virus subtype H5N1, Mid-dle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), and the Zika virus-which all originated in a particular country, AMR is a truly global threat with novel outbreak sites in multiple countries.",

According to the model put forward by Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde 1998 , an existential threat is first identified and accepted by an audience before a series of resource reallocations and policy responses is undertaken (emergency mode processes and policies) to resolve it. At its heart, the model presupposes that the initial actions taken by securitizing actors and agencies represent a rational attempt to resolve an existential threat to human existence. While the elements of this model have long been criticized-in terms of an overemphasis on the verbal nature of speech acts (Williams 2003; M\u00f6ller 2007) , the neglect of the role of audiences (Balzacq 2005; Vaughn 2009 ), or the Eurocentric nature of its agenda (Vuori 2008 )- Buzan and Waever (2009) have also observed that the theoretical and empirical space between the state and the global levels needs more attention.",

In particular, middle-level actors-and their attendant securitization processes-can become disaffected with their subordination to the higher-level process. Due to the global spread of infectious diseases and related health threats (such as AMR), the concurrent securitization responses provide valuable case studies wherein the conceptual utility of macrosecuritization can be evaluated (Lo and Thomas 2018) .",

By consciously not integrating lowertier actors and processes into the macrosecuritization framework, we argue that the model has suboptimal theoretical utility. It is only by understanding the perceptions and behaviors of these actors that it is possible to ascertain whether an issue has been securitized or not. As will be shown later in this article, from a surface reading of Chinese responses to AMR it would be possible to conclude that a middle-tier securitization-one that is integrated into a macrosecuritization-has taken place. Chinese officials, state media, and bureaucracies have all committed speech acts to support global efforts to address the existential threat of AMR. This is supported by domestic policy and technical communities that have reallocated funds and developed new policies and practices to address AMR threats.",

This is necessitated by the presence of competing lowerlevel policy and economic logics.",

This follows Buzan and Waever's observation that we must \"understand the tensions between overarching macrosecuritizations and the lower level securitizations that they contain and coordinate\" and provides an initial contribution to answering how \"macrosecuritisations [are] affected when they have to incorporate a new lower level securitization which undermines commitment to a larger goal\" (Buzan and Waever 2009, 275) . Implicit in this observation is the fact that it cannot be assumed that lower tiers will automatically follow middle-tier securitization processes-even in authoritarian systems. Ever since the 1980s, there has been a fragmentation of bureaucratic power in China between national and subnational actors. This fragmentation goes well beyond just the health sector to include economic policies, environmental regulations, and other areas of governance. Usually these are issues of domestic politics but the centrality of the Chinese biomedical and agribusiness sectors to international AMR efforts means that understanding Chinese policy and practice reactions to AMR is critical to evaluating the macrosecuritization of AMR globally.",

This study was motivated by a move made on the part of the Chinese leadership to securitize the threat without an epidemiological trigger event that would rationalize such a decision (as occurred with, for example, the SARS outbreaks in Foshan and Hong Kong). In our initial interviews, we met with leading microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, and epidemiologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), key research laboratories, and local universities. These interviews were supplemented with a second series of interviews with representatives from international health agencies (in China and globally), with public health specialists from other countries based in China, and with local researchers engaged in disease surveillance. Finally, we met with Chinese farmers engaged in poultry and pork production. These interviews were conducted in Cantonese, English, or Mandarin under the Chatham House Rule.

Developed by the Copenhagen School of Barry Buzan, Ole Waever, and Jaap de Wilde, securitization is a theoretical framework depicting the threat-framing process and the corresponding political reactions to eliminate a perceived threat. Most securitizations take place at the state and individual levels. The theorists believe that such a vibrant agenda at the middle level is attributed to the simplicity of identifying the referent objects in the securitization process. While the preceding middle-level security studies are of significance to enrich the research agenda of \"niche\" securitizations, what is still missing is the discussion of \"what happens above [or below] the middle-level securitization (Buzan and Waever 2009, 253) .\"",

Pertaining to the relationship between macrosecuritization and its corresponding middle-level securitizations, Buzan and Waever stated that the strongest form of macrosecuritization, such as the Cold War, \"will impose a hierarchy on the lower level ones incorporated within them.\" The less powerful ones, such as the Global War on Terror (GWoT), will \"bundle other securitizations together without outranking them\" (Ibid). The relationship between macrosecuritization and middle-level securitizations is, however, not necessarily peaceful. The structure is \"vulnerable to breakdowns not just by desecuritization of the macro-level threat (or referent object). . . but also by the middle-level securitizations becoming disaffected with, or pulling away from, subordination to the higher level one\" (Ibid). Owing to its large-scale, complex, and fairly unstable configuration, macrosecuritizations have only been recognized in a handful of cases: the Cold War (Buzan and Waever 2009 ), piracy (Bueger and Stockbruegger 2013) , and the GWoT (Romaniuk and Webb 2015) . Lo and Thomas (2018) added AMR as another case of macrosecuritization, based on the extent to which AMR responses fulfill the basic format of macrosecuritization and have been securitized at the global level.

To resolve such threats has required additional capacity being contributed from either the international community or other states, or both. Yet, frequently (in the cases of SARS, MERS, or Zika), the resulting alliances of states, corporations, and/or civil society actors have been \"temporary and instrumental\" (Buzan and Waever 2009, 256) .

However, some threats are of a longer term or are sufficiently threatening as to require a larger-scale response.

However, this assumes that all countries regard the threat posed by AMR in a similar manner. In the United States, Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Scott Gottlieb (2018) , stated that AMR was \"a global public health threat.\" In Europe, European Union (EU) Commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis (2017) , declared that, \"In 2001, antimicrobial resistance was a budding global public health threat. In the years since, it has grown into one of the biggest global threats not only to our health, but also to our environment, our food chain and our economies.\" In the United Kingdom (UK), Chief Medical Officer, Sara Davies (2013) , stated that, \"Antimicrobial resistance poses a catastrophic threat.\" Each of these statementsand their accompanying text-are clear indications that AMR is perceived as an existential threat, one not limited just to the health sector.",

As a result, these countries have moved beyond speech acts to emergency mode reallocations of resources to address AMR. For example, in 2015 the United States allocated close to double the funding to different federal agencies to address the threat posed by AMR. Of the US$1.2 billion allocated, over US$1 billion was related to public health aspects of anti-AMR programs, with the remaining funds targeted to animal and agricultural AMR strategies (White House 2015). Between 2007 and 2013, the EU allocated \u20ac314.1 million (\u223cUS$357 million) to AMR prevention programs (Kelly et al. 2016, 436) , with member states making their own contributions.

In that fiscal year (2016-2017), India allocated an additional 1.16 cr rupees (\u223cUS$16,390,000) to address AMR. However, by 2017-2018, this figure had fallen to zero (Sinha 2018) . This is despite the fact that India is one of the largest consumer markets for antibiotics. Indeed, in 2010 it was the largest market globally but, by 2017, it had fallen behind China (Van Boeckel et al. 2014, 745) . Interviews we conducted in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam in 2016-2017 all highlighted a similar disjuncture between rhetoric and intent. In each case, despite speech acts signaling an intention to address the threat posed by AMR, new resource allocations were negligible or shortlived-with the international community being a major source of funding on the issue. Moreover, the allocation of the new funds was a source of competition between different ministries, leading to resource mismanagement. At the same time, a senior agricultural official for an international organization noted that, regionally, there was \"no data sharing between different stakeholders, because they only see the downside of sharing data\" (Interview J 2017).",

This high use of antibiotics places China at the heart of global antimicrobial strategies. As with outbreaks of SARS and H5N1 in the first decade of this century, without a robust intervention strategy from China, the global effort to combat AMR will fall short of its eradication goal. This section advances our understanding of AMR as a health security threat in China. We first present a general overview of the rise of AMR as a policy issue before moving on to the issue with specific reference to humans first and animals second. Although these sectors are considered separately, this is a somewhat artificial divide. As will be shown in the following analysis, the basis for the threat posed by AMR is interchangeably located in both human practices and livestock production and is exacerbated by policy and regulatory shortcomings.",

Of the 210,000 tons of antibiotics made in China in 2006, a half was used to feed livestock for growth promotion and disease control (Collignon and Voss 2015) .

            "text": "actions. We cannot afford to lose this competition\" (Li 2017) . Interviews with international health representatives and public health officials and clinicians in China suggest that two key factors have come together to increase policy awareness of this threat. The first factor concerns the lack of new antibiotics being released. Only small profit margins are available to pharmaceutical companies for the development and sale of new antibiotics, for which resistance would not be an issue. As a result, growing resistance to existing antibiotics is not being mitigated by new antibiotics coming to market. As Khor (2016) observed, \"AMR is not confined to just a health issue-the entire situation is increasingly recognized as a market failure. Due to perceived poor returns on investment, the development of new antibiotics has almost come to a halt.\" Indeed, in 2018, Novartis joined As-traZeneca, Sanofi, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Allergan in exiting the antibiotic development field, further limiting the pool of possible sources of new antibiotics (Megget 2018) . This challenges an earlier mentality on antibiotics that one interviewee succinctly described as follows: \"In the past, scientists and policy makers believed that as long as new antibiotics rolled out there was nothing to worry about\" (Interview A 2017). The rapidly narrowing gap between what is available and what is viable has contributed to a heightened sense of threat from AMR. However, at the same time, the departure of five major pharmaceutical companies from antibiotic research and development also challenges the assumption that a successful macrosecuritization of AMR has taken place. If it had, it could have been expected that development of new antibiotics would have been stepped up and/or more new companies would have entered the market. The second factor concerns the fact that, in a post-SARS environment, there is pressure on the Chinese state (and by extension the Party) to ensure a safe public health environment. Every subsequent outbreak (H5N1, H1N1, H7N9, and MERS-CoV), coupled with episodic food safety issues, have raised social questions surrounding efficient and competent governance by local and national authorities. In terms of AMR, \"in the wake of the SARS outbreak, the Chinese government was aware of the AMR problem, thereby establishing the Ministry of Health National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Net (MOHNARIN) in 2005. Currently over 1,300 hospitals are included in the sentinel surveillance system\" (Interview A 2017). However, MOHNARIN is a passive surveillance system with no incentives that punish hospitals when they fail to report their findings. Indeed, several interviewees noted that hospitals can willfully withhold samples to argue for more equipment and upgraded capacities (human and technical). While such behavior only exacerbates risks posed by AMR, it also demonstrates that AMR is not considered an existential threat by these frontline healthcare providers. Theoretically, samples should be shared as a means to ensure survival. Instead, samples are used as bargaining chips to secure more resources. This behavior also reflects \"the emperor is far away\" reality of Chinese policy making. Even when a national program is in place, subnational actors can still subvert the ends of the program for their own means.",

This discovery was important, as the gene provides bacteria with resistance to colistin, a last-line antibiotic (Gao et al. 2016) . As with SARS, it is likely that the gene was in circulation in China before the initial study reported its existence. MCR-1's emergence is likely due to Chinese farmers, who regularly feed livestock colistin prophylactically. 2 A 2016 study revealed that 21 percent of pigs in China carried bacteria with MCR-1, as did 15 percent of tested chicken and pork meat samples as well as 1 percent of all hospitalized Chinese patients . As of March 2017, the gene had been detected in humans, animals, and livestock products in North America, Europe, and Asia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017). Hence, even though the initial creation of the gene is likely a result of inappropriately utilized antibiotics for livestock production, it has developed multiple avenues for transmission beyond its original environment.",

Despite this, antibiotics, by volume, are more widely used in agricultural activities, with nearly half \"deployed in food animals\" alone (Collignon and Voss 2015, 2) . Further, in regard to understanding the volume of antibiotics provided prophylactically through feed, China faces the same problem as other countries in that such data are considered commercially sensitive and are not provided by companies. 3 However, given that eight of the top twenty global producers of animal feed are Chinese companies (WattAgNet.com 2017), all of which have state ties, this should not be as much of a barrier for the Chinese government as for its counterparts around the world. Indeed, given that Chinese authorities have (occasionally) paid scant regard to commercial sensitivities in areas of industrial intellectual property, their reticence to do so in this area only highlights the economic sensitivity of agriculture. In terms of framing AMR in China, this economic prioritization challenges the existential nature of the threat, limiting its immediacy and giving preference to rhetorical and discursive securitization over a full shift into emergency mode. To better explore why this is the case, the threat posed by AMR to the human and animal populations will now be considered.",

(Fleming 1945) Alexander Fleming's 1945 Nobel Prize address included a prescient warning on the dangers of misusing antibiotics, but this represents only half of the equation. Fleming's comments were made at a time when antibiotic supplies were still limited for most people and a year before biochemists identified the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in livestock. While the development of resistance can originate from insufficient quantities of antibiotics, a host can be equally endangered from using too many antibiotics. In China, the latter issue is more severe within the population. A nationwide survey of 230,800 prescriptions, given across 784 community health institutions in twenty-eight Chinese cities from 2007 to 2009, shows that the number of antibiotic prescriptions given was two times more than that recommended by the WHO (Li et al. 2012) . Another report showed that roughly 57 percent of people in China had received antibiotics over the previous six months in 2015 (Zhongguo pinglun tongxunshe 2015). This was an issue that Fleming could not have foreseen (i.e., that the level of resistance in a population can be a medical threat as much as an individual's resistance).",

To make this situation worse, patients with either minor ailments or non-serious illnesses frequently seek to have antibiotics intravenously administered from healthcare providers at all levels (tertiary, secondary, and primary). This is due to the widely held belief that an intravenous (IV) drip (dadiandi) is a panacea for all kinds of illnesses. A 2009 study indicated that the average person in China consumes eight bottles of IV infusion fluid per year against a world average of 2.5-3.3 bottles per person (World Health Organization 2012). This figure highlights not only the role that IV antibiotic injections play in the rampant misuse and overuse of antibiotics in the country but also the complicity of healthcare professionals and institutions in the inappropriate provision of medicine.",

Currie, Lin, and Meng (2014) observed that despite the EDL being implemented, social behaviors in China with respect to the use and supply of antibiotics have not changed, with patients still wanting antibiotics and with doctors still willing to prescribe them beyond what patients' conditions warrant. In addition, there is an entrenched habit among patients to seek antibiotics by engaging in polypharmaceutical behaviors either by visiting numerous doctors for the same condition or by purchasing multiple courses of drugs from pharmacies. 4 As multiple studies have noted, prescriptions for antibiotics account for roughly half of all prescriptions made by doctors (Yin et al. 2013; Lin et al. 2016) .",

            "text": "One main reason for the overprescription of antibiotics lies in a lack of health budgets. Public hospitals receive only 10 percent of their funding from the government, and so they make up the 90 percent shortfall by charging patients for medicine (Lazarus 2016) . More importantly, public hospitals are allowed to sell medicines and antibiotics with a 15 percent markup to cover operation expenses. Regulatory attempts made by the state in 2009 to cancel this markup practice as part of the EDL reform did not, however, effectively resolve the problem, as problems related to financial incentives were not fully addressed. The latest effort to address this issue is the 2017 Trial Opinion on the Implementation of a Two-Invoice System for Public Medical Institutions' Drug Procure-4 An instance one researcher directly observed involved a single individual using a collection of identity cards to purchase multiple courses of antibiotics. The medicines were prescribed for a single individual, whose friends and family members loaned him their cards. The pharmacy's records simply noted a series of individuals who had come in on the same day to purchase the same medicine. The intent of the individual purchasing these drugs remained completely open and, by using a set of identity cards, the pharmacist involved was able to make a profit while still having a record showing that they were operating within the rules. ment, or the \"two-invoice system\" for public medical institutions. Under the new system, manufacturers send their products to a distributor, and these products are then transported directly to hospitals or clinics (Li and Sindik 2017) . This is an important reform developed to standardize drug circulation, to reduce the number of drugs in circulation, and thus to lower drug prices (as prices increase with the number of distributors and intermediaries involved/with the number of invoices issued). However, a senior AMR scientist commented that, \"without an increase in budgets to public hospitals, medical institutions have to find ways to gain profits to sustain daily operations. Whenever there is a need for healthcare facilities to determine their own budgets (intermediate environment), the problem of AMR cannot be mitigated in China\" (Interview A 2017). This resources shortfall again highlights the problematic nature of AMR securitization in China. If the Chinese authorities had actually securitized AMR, there should have been a corresponding shift of resources into key sectors and institutions (such as hospitals). While funding to the public healthcare sector has increased in percentage terms (State Council 2017), it is coming off a low base, one where most of the new fiscal capacity is to support long-term institution building rather than directly addressing an existential threat from AMR or similar health insecurities (S\u00fcssmuth-Dyklerhoff and Wang 2010). As McInnes and Rushton (2013, 128) argue, \"although the absence of emergency measures may not in itself be conclusive, it may offer an indication that an issue has not been fully securitized.\" In the absence of a resources shift by Chinese authorities, it is hard to argue that the motivation for securitizing AMR is to deal with the perception of it as an existential threat.",

In response to the 2009 National Essential Medicines Policy (NEMP), the Shanghai government instituted new policies whereby \"presidents of hospitals were required to take full responsibilities [sic] for the use of antibiotics and were subjected to annual assessments of performance, resulting in potential dismissals or promotions\" (Y.

(2016, 1,388) , who determined that \"the spatial distribution of antibiotics uses is determined by the economic status in China where wealth and resource are unevenly distributed and that are undergoing dramatic change.\" In the case of wealthier areas (which are always urban areas in China), the authors note that the per capita actual-use volume of antibiotics is higher in these areas and that this could be attributed to the abuse of antibiotics. Lowy (2003, 1,266) concluded that the emergence of AMR first \"in hospitals and then spreading to the community, is now a well-established pattern that recurs with each new wave of antimicrobial resistance.\" However, in the case of China, it is not clear whether this pattern holds true. While hospitals remain important sites for addressing AMR, the disaggregated nature of the Chinese public health system means that frontlines for the development of AMR are far more communitybased than they are in more developed countries. The most obvious area where this can be seen is in the distribution of antibiotics and other medicines. Here, the distribution of and access to antibiotics-frequently in unregulated or under-regulated environments-mean that Chinese waves of resistance are disaggregated across the country, fueled by mutually reinforcing public and animal sources. This presents a significant challenge to domestic and global efforts to combat the threat posed by AMR. This is also a clear outcome of a profound lack of public education on drugs and medicines within local communities and in the school system. A senior Chinese AMR scientist stated, \"People have low awareness of AMR issues because few media outlets report on the problem. For example, there are many anti-tobacco advertisements, but there are none on AMR. There is also no education campaign on antibiotic use in primary and secondary schools\" (Interview A 2017). One university academic in Beijing likewise stated, \"Education on the proper use of antibiotics is nonexistent in schools. There is no booklet/poster on the proper use of antibiotics in rural health facilities\" (Interview B 2016). These opinions are further supported by a senior officer of an international financial institution, who concluded that, \"Health promotion in China is merely about information giving. Insufficient information or knowledge does not change people's behaviors. People still kill and eat sick chickens; others believe that if one falls sick after eating a sick chicken, this is just a result of bad luck\" (Interview C 2017). Within the Chinese system, a lack of such education campaigns reinforces our point that without public awareness of the issue, there cannot be audience acceptance of the securitizing act, particularly at the lower tiers, restricting attempts to securitize the threat beyond the middle tier. 5 Indeed, it would be a mistake to assume that simply because Beijing has developed new policies and regulations on the use of antibiotics, such policies should be automatically implemented nationally (even with the securitizing move). As Hu (2013) observed, there are differences in ways that the policies are implemented between provinces and between the public and private healthcare sectors. This is supported by Qian (2015, 31-2) , who concluded that \"local bureaus are likely to be accountable for the local government leaders rather than their ministries when implementing the health reform (e.g., local health bureau vs the NHFPC), which makes the coordination among government departments at the central level even more complicated.\" In terms of macrosecuritization, this suggests that even in authoritarian states, substate actors have the capacity to prioritize competing strategies over national-level securitization acts. This reinforces Buzan and Waever's (2009, 275) point that it is necessary to consider the lower tiers when evaluating a successful macrosecuritization.",

By 2013, this had increased to over 113 million head of cattle . As Sampaio stated in Reed and Rodrigo (2015) , \"Beef consumption is directly related to income. China has rising incomes and a large population. This is reflected in an increase in protein consumption.\" Similarly, Chinese pork production levels have increased sevenfold since the late 1970s, rendering China the largest consumer and producer of swine products in the world (The Economist 2014). In line with these trends, Chinese production of poultry and eggs has also increased markedly since the liberalization of the agricultural sector. China is now the second largest producer of chicken meat and the largest producer of eggs in the world, with both chicken meat and eggs forming a significant part of the daily Chinese diet. This growth in both livestock production and antibiotic usage has been and will continue to be facilitated by an ongoing structural reorganization of Chinese farms away from smallscale operations to large commercial operations. While this mirrors changes occurring in other countries such as the United States, it has not been accompanied by a concomitant increase in food safety.",

In addition to prophylactic and therapeutic doses of antibiotics, feedstock is also laced with antibiotics. While maximizing the growth potential of livestock is an intended outcome of this cocktail, as commercial farming has intensified in China, this triple dose of antibiotics has become necessary to combat the increasingly unhygienic conditions in which many of these animals are raised. Here, the difference between Chinese commercial farms and those in, for example, the United States is stark. Cargill, for example, has begun to phase out antibiotics use in its swineherds (Cargill undated) . This has been achieved with only slight increases in disease prevalence and slight losses of growth potential (Interview D 2017) . Hence, the rationale to use antibiotics as a growth promoter that emerged after the Second World War, and which continues to dominate production plans in Chinese commercial farms, is no longer necessarily valid when a hygienic environment is established. 6 Currently, there are no official data or information on levels of antibiotics used in Chinese agriculture (Krishnasamy, Otte, and Silbergeld 2015) . In terms of the volume of antibiotics used for animal husbandry in China, Xiao estimated that 46 percent of the 210,000 tons of antibiotics produced in China are administered through the livestock industry (Hvistendahl 2012) . Another 2012 estimate suggested that in China, 84.9 million pounds (38.5 million kg) of antibiotics were used on livestock (Garrett and Laxminarayan 2017) . Krishnasamy, Otte, and Silbergeld (2015) suggested that sulphonamides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin) are widely used for animal husbandry in China. Of the two main groups of meat products (pork and poultry) produced in China, the authors calculated that 4.5 million kg of antimicrobials were used for poultry production, while 34 million kg were used for swine production in China in 2012.",

In China, while the human abuse of antibiotics is partly attributed to financial incentives for public healthcare facilities to sell unnecessary and expensive antibiotics, the overuse of antibiotics in the animal husbandry sector is likewise induced by economic incentives for the use of antibiotics as growth promoters. Despite the fact that data show little or even no economic benefits in terms of meat production, growth promotion uses are a major contributor to antibiotics usage in Chinese food animal farms. As the largest antimicrobial consumer of livestock in 2010, China used one-third of all growth-stimulus antibiotics fed to livestock worldwide . The economic incentive that encourages antibiotics use in livestock production was highlighted in an interview with a chicken farmer in Guangdong province in June 2017. Our interviewee stated that, \"Chickens fed with artificial feed premixed with antibiotics grow much faster than those fed with homemade feed. It takes only 40 days for the former chickens to be ready to sell on the market and 200 days for the latter\" (Interview E 2017). The same farmer noted that when he and other farmers can access cheap human antibiotics, these are also fed to the animals for either growth promotion or therapeutic purposes. This echoes comments made by the head of a Chinese microbiology lab who mentioned that \"the effectiveness of tetracycline [as a growth promoter] remains inconsistent. In any case, farmers feel that tetracycline and antibiotics in general facilitate livestock production, and so they add antibiotics to livestock feed\" (Interview F 2016) .",

One reason for colistin's widespread application in piggeries is its toxicity, which meant Chinese authorities never approved it for human use. Another reason is that colistin is an older drug and so it is fairly cheap; therefore, Chinese farmers can administer a large volume of colistin together with animal feed at a low cost. Recent figures show that, as the world's largest pig producer, China is also the largest consumer of the 12,000 tons of colistin in agriculture each year (Zhang 2015) . China is also one of the world's largest producers of colistin for animal husbandry. Although the dangers posed by using such last-line antibiotics in livestock are well documented, only recently have these dangers been tied to the use of colistin in the Chinese swine industry. In 2015, MCR-1 was found in pigs in China. A year later, the gene was identified in humans, some of whom had acquired their infections from animals directly or from eat-ing pork (Garrett and Laxminarayan 2017) . MCR-1 is now found on every continent. The global spread of the gene implies that humans are losing a last-resort antibiotic for curing deadly drug-resistant superbug infections (e.g., carbapenem-resistant infections). The emergence of colistin resistance has sparked fears concerning public health in China, renewing calls for urgent policy responses to address the use of antibiotics for animal husbandry.",

According to one interviewee, \"farmers will not change their behaviors unless the punishment is more significant than the benefits they can gain\" (Interview G 2016). It also reinforces our argument that the securitization of AMR in China is not being undertaken to address an existential threat. If it were, an effective colistin and AGP ban would have been promulgated. Indeed, as we have discussed throughout this article, the logic of the Chinese securitization act is to enable the policy center to gain greater enforcement capacity over its subnational counterparts. This conclusion extends our earlier point that it is necessary to consider the behavior of lower-level actors in applying macrosecuritization approaches to encompass the necessity of taking the relationships between actors at different levels into account, in this case, between the individual and the state. The fact that even in authoritarian states-such as China-the individual still has agency to resist or subvert securitization acts further suggests that Vuori's criticisms of securitization being inherently Eurocentric need to be reconsidered (Vuori 2008) .",

The imbalance in the Chinese approach to AMR, coupled with a lack of resources available to monitor the situation, suggest that at the central level, AMR is being discursively securitized with only the partial enactment of an emergency mode approach.

These shifts have been particularly championed by the United States and the UK. This has led to increased attention being paid to the issue by other major states. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Agency for International Development bring significant financial and human resources to bear in developing states, which otherwise do not have the capacity to securitize AMR. In China, while most of public policy resources are focused at the national level in Beijing, both organizations work directly with local officials in the provinces either on projects or in terms of training field epidemiologists. Similarly, the UK and European states have run capacity-building workshops on AMR in China.

China is not a unique case in this instance. Since AMR has been macrosecuritized, for example, all the leading states (the United States, the UK, and the EU states) have implemented new national policies to address the threat despite opposition from internal lobby groups. This is despite the fact that the threat posed by AMR has been long recognized. As such, the recent efforts made by the international community to macrosecuritize AMR need to be unpacked, so as to illuminate whether these acts represent global action on a global threat or are designed to meet domestic agendas.

From our interviews with representatives of international health organizations, external health agencies, and domestic actors, this shortcoming is well known, globally and within China. However, the desire to address the threat of AMR and to develop global action on the issue is governed by realpolitik considerations that accept suboptimal commitments in exchange for consensus building.

Only by focusing on a pre-stage level at which motivations for the securitizing act can be examined can the rationale for securitization be properly determined.

At the same time, the theory allows for contending lower-tier political or securitization agendas to exert bottom-up pressure on the process. Hence, the notion of audience needs to be unpacked. As our case study highlights, even as the Chinese state has supported the macrosecuritization of AMR, subnational and individual-level actors have ignored (partially or completely) the resulting national directives. As we have shown, this lower-tier resistance has come about due to contending political and resource competitions within the state. A question that arises beyond the scope of this article is: To what extent does the emergency distribution of resources during securitization validate the act itself? In this article, we have identified a negative case-where the insufficient distribution of emergency resources weakens audience acceptance and thus the domestic securitization of AMR and, as a consequence, the macrosecuritization of AMR. The role of science in policy making in China also comes under question. As we note in reference to the MOHNARIN network, funds the state has made available are insufficient to operate a truly national surveillance program despite claims to the contrary. While there is also the CHINET network of sentinel hospitals and laboratories as well as closed WeChat networks for clinicians and infectious disease researchers, these also have gaps. Moreover, there is no sense of integration between these different capacities. This leads to a patchwork approach to AMR, in particular, and to infectious disease surveillance, more generally. Such a result is at odds with China's image as a centralized state that can implement core directives as needed. Even in the age of Xi Jinping's China Dream, the provinces and lower-tier public health agencies and institutions are able to disregard or imperfectly implement policies and practices when this suits their needs.",

This implicitly creates a highly competitive environment wherein support for funded activities denotes continued access to resources. In the case of China, when the state does not supply sufficient funding, external health agencies and foundations can do so. However, as noted above, competition generated by resource scarcities can create a perversely competitive environment wherein even viral samples are not shared between local hospitals because when a host hospital runs an analysis it creates a basis for that hospital to seek additional funding for training and equipment. Again, this is by no means a situation unique to China. As Elbe (2010) demonstrated with reference to H5N1 in Indonesia, the physical control of such samples can be leveraged by states to gain access to additional financial, human, or pharmaceutical resources. In resource-constrained countries, such as China and Indonesia, competition is more severe because resources are scarcer. Equally, in Vietnam, the state simply manages disease control, preferring not to expend scarce resources on their elimination and only taking action when human lives are threatened or when the issue attracts international attention (Interview J 2017). This, in turn, means that external donors can affect local public health priorities disproportionate to the actual needs of the recipient state and society.",
