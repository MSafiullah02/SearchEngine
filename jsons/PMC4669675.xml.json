The National Malaria Control Programme commissioned a nationwide survey of health facilities, complemented by an analysis of surveillance data available nationally, to verify and quantify these anecdotal reports, to characterise malaria case management in the context of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, and to document the effect of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic on malaria case management.",

We found one peer-reviewed published report with systematically gathered data about the effect of the Ebola epidemic on health-care delivery, showing a reduction in the use of inpatient services in Sierra Leone. We also found a modelling report of the estimation of excess malaria morbidity and mortality caused by the Ebola epidemic.\nAdded value of this study\nThis study is the first systematic analysis of outpatient health-care use in an Ebola-affected country during the current outbreak. We focused specifically on malaria, the main cause of fever and health-care demand in Guinea. We documented changes in malaria case management practices since the start of the epidemic, quantified the reduction in the delivery of malaria care since the start of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, and estimated the excess malaria morbidity and mortality due to the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, which greatly exceed the morbidity and mortality rates directly due to Ebola virus disease. The large sample size of this study, both in terms of health facilities sampled and patients' records reviewed, comparison of Ebola-unaffected and Ebola-affected prefectures, long retrospective review, and confirmation of national surveillance data with survey data from systematically sampled health facilities contribute to the robustness of the findings.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe indirect effects of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, particularly those on malaria care delivery, lend support for strengthening health-care delivery in the context of Ebola virus disease. The significant effect of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic on malaria morbidity and mortality rates should be considered by ministries of health and donors when allocating sparse health-care resources.\n",

This decrease occurred throughout the country, even in areas with no reported cases of Ebola virus disease. The decrease occurred despite health facilities generally remaining open, likely because of financial incentives put in place by the National Ebola Coordination to encourage health-care workers to remain at health facilities.

Several key alternative explanations for the reduction can be excluded. Climatic changes are unlikely to have caused the decline, since 2014 was an average year for rainfall in Guinea (appendix). Although there were universal campaigns for coverage of bednet distribution throughout Guinea in late 2013, and early 2014, the timing does not correspond to the decline in malaria cases seeking care at health facilities, and this alternative explanation does not account for why the decline in malaria cases would be larger in Ebola-affected areas.
