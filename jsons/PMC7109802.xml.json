For example, few clinicians order sputum-smear microscopy for a TB diagnosis because the turnaround time for the results may be longer than the average hospital stay, and patients are often discharged or die before the results are received.",

In fact, because some HIV/AIDS laboratory investments had strengthened laboratory core systems in some RPCs, they have been instrumental in the past in supporting the investigation of other disease outbreaks.21 Moreover, with support from the World Bank\u2019s AIDS Program and PEPFAR, Rwanda developed a functional integrated national reference laboratory that is currently used to combat multiple diseases, including TB, malaria, and epidemic-prone diseases (eg, cholera), and priority diseases.",

First, public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been shown to be effective in strengthening health systems in RPCs.23 Therefore, PPPs that focus on implementing established laboratory plans will be vital. In this respect, PEPFAR has entered into an $18 million PPP agreement with Becton Dickinson, a private medical diagnostic company, to strengthen laboratory capacity in 8 African countries in the areas of training, development of referral systems for transporting samples, and quality management schemes.24 Similarly, the Abbott Fund in Tanzania is developing laboratory infrastructure in the country, including a state-of-the-art reference laboratory in Dar es Salaam, and upgrading all regional hospital laboratories in the country.25 Second, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Corporate Champions program for multinational corporations to fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, which gives companies the opportunity to significantly commit to global health, is another possibility for recipient countries to advocate for laboratory systems. Third, the GHI should devote particular attention to strengthening laboratory systems by establishing strategic PPPs. Fourth, effective partnerships with diagnostic companies can also help develop point-of-care machines that can be used for diagnostics across multiple diseases, an effort the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics has spearheaded in the last 5 years.

The ACILT was created after in-depth consultation on laboratory training needs of several African countries, in collaboration with the WHO Regional Office for Africa. The courses used a competency-based approach for the trainees to obtain knowledge and skills at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases; attendees then returned to their countries and developed competencies while working under supervision and received follow-up visits by the core training staff of ACILT. This training approach is similar to the short-course component of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2013supported field epidemiology training programs in several RPCs. In these programs, field epidemiologists and public health laboratory staff are jointly trained in long courses (ie, 2-year public health leadership training) and short courses (ie, 1- to 2-week public health implementer training) to acquire skills and develop competencies while providing a public health service.29 These were modeled on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Epidemic Intelligence Service. Laboratory components of the field epidemiology training programs will need to be standardized and strengthened to address needs for technicians, managers, and policy makers.",

Thus, the WHO Regional Office for Africa stepwise laboratory accreditation program and the Thai Accreditation scheme, both described in this issue of the Journal, offer practical and affordable approaches to quality management systems that can be implemented and scaled up in developing countries. There is need to establish continuous laboratory medical education (CMLE) for clinicians so as to bridge the gap between laboratory testing and uptake for patient management. Regional societies for laboratory medicine or clinical pathology could serve as the appropriate vehicle to meet these critical gaps, including implementing CMLE and certification of training for medical technologists.",

The efforts of RPC governments and partners should be focused on developing an integrated and functional tiered NLS through a comprehensive national laboratory strategic plan and policy, establishment of PPPs, leadership and commitment of host countries that is needed to effectively coordinate donors and implement the efforts of partners, establishment of centers of excellence to meet urgent human capacity needs, and implementation of practical and affordable laboratory accreditation schemes and CMLE for physicians.
