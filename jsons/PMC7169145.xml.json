The majority of infections are subclinical, but occasionally, they cause diseases such as the common cold, hand\u2010foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease (HFMD), myocarditis meningitis, otitis media, neonatal sepsis, pancreatitis, poliomyelitis and sinusitis 1, 2. In addition, enterovirus infections have been associated with inflammatory diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, asthma and allergies 1, 3. Our understanding of the complex processes leading to these different disorders is limited, and a better knowledge of how these viruses interact with the host is essential for the discovery of disease\u2010causing mechanisms and the identification of targets for the development of therapeutic measures. All enteroviruses encode two proteases, 2A (2Apro) and 3C (3Cpro), which are essential for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein into structural\u2010 and non\u2010structural proteins. These proteases can also cleave host\u2010cell proteins, and cellular targets already identified include transcription factors, proteins controlling nuclear import/export, mitochondria\u2010associated proteins, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and other proteins, many of which are involved in the activation of the host immune response 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. The cleavage of host\u2010cell proteins may contribute to pathology 14, 15, 16, and a better insight into the target specificities of the enteroviral proteases, coupled with information on how protein cleavages affect the biological functions of the cell, is likely to reveal novel disease mechanisms as well as identify ways to treat and prevent enterovirus\u2010mediated diseases.",

The presence of a receptor on the cell surface is, however, not the only determinant for cellular permissiveness. The virus may enter the cell but fail to replicate if, for example, there is a lack of endogenous cellular proteins required for viral propagation. An example of such an endogenous protein is the polypyrimidine tract\u2010binding protein (PTB) 32. Alternatively, the receptor\u2010expressing cell can enter an antiviral state and thereby, may not be permissive to infection (reviewed in 33).

To date, the amino acid residues P4, P2, P1, P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 are recognized as being important determinants for the sequence specificity of enteroviral proteases (Figure 4) 65, 76. For the substrate recognition of 2Apro, the most important residue is P1\u2032, which is exclusively a glycine. Following P1\u2032 in order of importance are P2, occupied mainly by threonine and asparagine; P2\u2032, occupied by proline, alanine and phenylalanine; and P4, occupied most frequently by leucine or threonine. For 3Cpro, the residues P1 and P1\u2032 show the least amount of variance in the substrate sequence. The preferred residues for these positions are glutamine or glutamate for P1, and glycine, asparagine or serine for P1\u2032. In addition, the most common residue is alanine in position P4 and proline in position P2\u2032. The most obvious feature for determining the substrate specificity of both 2Apro and 3Cpro is the strong conservation of the glycine residue in position P1\u2032 76, and the present understanding of which residues are important in the other positions may be revised as new information becomes available (refer to the \u2018Methods to Identify New Cellular Substrates for Enteroviral Proteases\u2019 and \u2018Cleavage Predictions Using in Silico Analysis Techniques, Bioinformatics\u2019 sections in the succeeding texts).",

Many of the inhibitors that have been developed and studied are small molecule peptide mimetics that target the active site of the proteases, but other small molecular compounds have also been described 81. Structural conservation and the commonly shared proteolytic mechanism seen between different viral proteases make it possible to develop inhibitors that have an antiviral activity towards many species in the Enterovirus genus and furthermore, occasional activity towards more distantly related viruses. Such inhibitor candidates include pyrazole compounds that target 3Cpro from different enteroviruses as well as coronavirus protease homologues of 3Cpro\n79, microcyclic inhibitors against enterovirus 3Cpro and noro\u2010 and SARS\u2010coronavirus 3Cpro homologues 82.

Hospital visits and symptomatic treatments for the severe infections are costly, and it is clear that a better understanding for the complex disease mechanisms underlying enterovirus\u2010mediated diseases would lead to more efficacious treatments. A few disease mechanisms have been identified, and in the near future, additional ones are likely to be discovered by research teams that integrate many scientific disciplines such as bioinformatics, molecular biology, proteomics and the use of patient materials. Several pathological mechanisms may be explained by the activity of the viral proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro. Some effects, such as the shutting down of host\u2010cell protein synthesis, immune evasion, as well as the hijacking of the cellular machinery to favour virus propagation, may be common to most enteroviruses. However, especially in the persistent types of infections when the production of viral proteins, including proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro, continues for months or years, the degradation of host proteins may be virus\u2010 and tissue\u2010specific and may lead to more selective pathological processes (e.g. myocarditis and the development of dilated cardiomyopathy). Currently, there are only a limited number of studies that have addressed the role of the proteases in a tissue\u2010specific manner. Better tools to globally identify and verify protease targets should assist in the identification of novel cellular protein substrates without limitations to particular cell types. Overall, this should provide a better understanding of how the proteases, in concert with other viral proteins, contribute to the induction of different diseases. Such information will also be of immediate importance for the development of novel drugs, including protease inhibitors, to prevent and treat diseases caused by enteroviruses.

Hydrophilic residues are shown in green colour, and hydrophobic residues are shown in black colour. Negatively charged residues are coloured red. The lower panel logos were created using all currently available enteroviral polyprotein sequences in the Uniprot database 77. Duplicate sequences were removed to avoid bias towards sequences with multiple entries. The logos were generated using WebLogo 78. Left panels: The most important recognition sites for 2Apro in order of lowest variability are at locations P1\u2032, P2, P2\u2032, P4 and P3. The relatively low variability to the right of P2\u2032 can be a result of the sequence being a functional part of 2Apro itself, as the protease cleaves its own N\u2010terminal end free from the polyprotein by in cis cleavage. Right panels: The most important recognition sites for 3Cpro in order of lowest variability are at locations P1, P1\u2032, P4 and P2\u2032.",
