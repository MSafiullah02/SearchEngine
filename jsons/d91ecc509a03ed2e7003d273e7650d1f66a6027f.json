Many of the authors are anesthesiologists who were at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, either because they resided there or were swiftly relocated to deliver care. Their challenge was to respond quickly, effectively, and safely against something about which they initially knew little. The experience gained in China offers valuable lessons for other practitioners as the wave of coronavirus infection rolls through other countries. These Chinese authors contacted Anesthesiology asking to share their experience of providing care and protecting themselves so that others-patients and practitioners-could benefit. This is another example of public health for public benefit.",

These were based on the practice and experience of the frontline anesthesiologists who provided care to the patients in China. Major elements of these recommendations include precautions for perioperative care for patients suspected or confirmed with COVID-19, considerations for emergency tracheal intubation of patients outside of the operating room, and surveillance of anesthesia providers who cared for these patients. Anesthesiologists, in leading the creation and promulgation of these recommendations.

It describes anesthesia practice in the epicenter of Wuhan and how anesthesiologists were affected through two stages: December 2019 to January 2020 and January 2020 to the present. Hospital capacity and practitioners were quickly overwhelmed, necessitating the exigent relocation of thousands of healthcare workers and the emergent de novo construction of entire new hospitals. A high percentage of patients needed oxygen therapy and/ or ventilatory support, and special intubation teams were created. Numerous healthcare workers themselves became infected. Communication, both domestically within China and internationally, helped quickly educate practitioners and distribute needed resources.",

Specific details about practices of intubation and ventilation in critically ill patients in Wuhan are provided. Although elective surgery ceased, emergency surgery continued. The article also described, in detail, the risk to healthcare providers, nearly 2,000 of whom became infected, and the efforts regarding personal protection and personal protective equipment.",

They review COVID-19 pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and potential therapeutics with a focus on management of COVID-19associated respiratory failure. The article draws on recent publications on COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and guidelines from major health organizations. COVID-19 patients can progress to hypoxemic respiratory failure or multisystem organ failure, necessitating intubation and intensive care management, and in extreme cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or surgical procedures may be required. This review provides a comprehensive summary of evidence available to guide management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.",

Silvia Munoz-Price, an anesthesiologist and an epidemiologist, respectively, is an Editorial about infection control and transmission. It reinforces the message of the Special Articles that novel coronavirus outbreaks may be particularly hazardous to healthcare workers. It reminds practitioners that hospital-acquired organisms can originate from the anesthesia workplace and the hands of anesthesia providers; that providers should be familiar with airborne isolation procedures, which are seldom necessary for routine anesthesia practice; and that operating rooms should consider having a dedicated anesthesia cart for high infection risk situations. Similarly, a Letter from Dr. Renyu Liu addresses precautions for intubating patients with COVID-19. It reinforces concepts of safety for patients and also for care providers, whose ability to deliver care depends on their own health.",

            "text": "These articles offer, through firsthand account and scholarly review, lessons about the novel 2019 coronavirus and the healthcare response that it galvanized. The scale and speed of the COVID-19 epidemic are unprecedented, and mobilization of Chinese health providers to control the epidemic was impressive. Anesthesiologists in Wuhan and those rescue teams sent to Wuhan were some of the specialists who were first responders, and they were seminal in critical care, emergent airway management, respiration, ventilation, oxygenation, and personal protective equipment training for airway management and critical care. Approximately 1,000 anesthesiologists from outside Hubei Province relocated to deliver care. Mechanisms and risks of transmission and of provider infection were initially unknown. Protocols for care had to be emergently created. Facilities were rapidly overwhelmed, new large hospitals designated to care for patients with COVID-19 were constructed in just days, and one temporary facility took only 33 h from initial planning to full operation and patient admission. Anesthesiology leadership, both locally and nationally by the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology and Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists, was vital. Fortunately, the coronavirus infection rate in China appears to be decreasing. Identification of the mode of transmission and application of corresponding precautionary measures diminished infection of Chinese healthcare workers and the general population. Nevertheless, the infection rate is increasing elsewhere worldwide. We acknowledge the colleagues who have been and are providing care to patients in China and elsewhere. It is hoped that the experiences and lessons learned and shared by Chinese anesthesiologists will be of benefit worldwide.",
