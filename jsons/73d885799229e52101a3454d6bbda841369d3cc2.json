These symptoms are often preceded by a viral prodrome of low-grade fever, running nose and cough. Usually the children are not toxic and they do not have drooling of saliva. The illness usually lasts for 2-5 days. If obstruction worsens, the child becomes increasingly tachypnoeic with respiratory distress indicated by retractions. Rarely respiratory failure occurs.

There is role for IV, IM, oral and inhaled corticosteroids. Their action usually starts 1-2 h after administration. Popularly a single oral or intramuscular dose of dexamethasone 0.15 mg/ kg for the mild variety up to 0.6 mg/kg in severe cases is used in the emergency room/OP and is suffi cient. Rarely the second dose is administered after 8-12 h based on clinical need. Oral prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day for 24 h is another option. Inhaled budesonide 2 mg in 3 ml normal saline also has rapid effect and is found to be useful. \u2022 Epinephrine nebulisation is used in cases of moderate to severe croup, whenever there is evidence of respiratory distress and retractions are present even at rest. Nebulised adrenaline (epinephrine) solution 1 in 1,000 (1 mg/mL) should be given with close clinical monitoring in a dose of 400 \u03bcg/kg (maximum 5 mg) repeated after 30 min if necessary. Administration of three doses of nebulised adrenaline within 60 min has caused dysrhythmia and myocardial infarction in children. The effects of nebulised adrenaline last 2-3 h; the child should be closely monitored/observed for at least 4 h after giving. \u2022 There is no role for antibiotics unless when croup is thought to be caused by a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
