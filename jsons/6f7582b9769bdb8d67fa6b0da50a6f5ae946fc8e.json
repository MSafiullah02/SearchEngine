As of May 6, 2020, there were over 1.1 million confirmed cases and over 60,000 deaths in the United States. 1 While there is still much unknown about the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is clear that this pandemic, unlike any public health challenge in recent memory, has the potential to fundamentally alter the delivery of many healthcare services, including the practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery.

The conference aimed to help OMSs gain an overall understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on the field. Second, it disseminated strategies to protect OMS staff, residents, and faculty. Third, it provided sessions focused on how the pandemic alters the management of various areas of OMS: head and neck trauma, dentoalveolar surgery, head and neck cancer surgery, craniofacial surgery, cosmetic surgery, and trigeminal nerve surgery. Fourth, it highlighted the impact that OMSs can make on their local health system to aid with the COVID-19 response. Fifth, the conference examined how COVID-19 affects OMS resident education. Finally, the conference outlined the initiatives by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) to support OMSs during this crisis.",

The following is a summary of the pertinent opinions and strategies recommended by speakers. they have had two negative COVID-19 tests separated by at least 24 hours, due to the possibility of false negative results. More specific recommendations can be made since late March, with increased availability of testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and improvements in COVID-19 testing. When treating asymptomatic patients who are COVID-19 testing negative, standard precautions maybe appropriate dependent on local conditions. The chance of an occupational exposure in an asympomatic patient who has a negative COVID-19 test can be calculated by multiplying the local rate of a positive COVID-19 test in an asymptomatic patient by the false negative rate of the COVID-19 test in an asymptomatic patient and by the risk of the viral particle exposure based on the particle filtration efficiency of the mask ( Figure 1 ). If symptom or test status cannot be ascertained, additional special precautions to avoid exposure to coronavirus are indicated. This recommendation, however, should be based on local conditions and be situationally appropriate.",

Early diagnosis and early time to treatment of oral cancers have been associated with improved survival; delayed diagnosis from stage 1 to 2 cancers is more detrimental to survival than the delay from stage 3 to 4. 12 In addition, tumors that undergo primary surgery or primary radiotherapy are more greatly impacted by delays in initiation of treatment than tumors that are planned for primary concurrent chemoradiotherapy. 12 Treatment planning should be supported with evidence-based guidelines whenever possible and compatible with the resources available.",

We must pay attention to the numbers and evaluate the appropriate projection to prepare the health system for upcoming challenges. One of the most valuable roles of OMSs during this pandemic is to manage patients in an outpatient setting or via telemedicine. This keeps many patients out of the hospital emergency departments, which can lighten the load on already strained medical resources. It is important to note, however, that the deferral of many dental treatments (i.e. using prescriptions to manage dental abscesses) is not sustainable in the long term. Many of these patients will eventually need emergency surgical care, such as dental extractions. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause lingering disruptions for many health systems.

A culture and appropriate training of proper hygiene precautions is necessary for all individuals involved in the care of the patient. Additionally, the gathering of appropriate PPE and the appropriate utilization of PPE should be considered to minimize healthcare related COVID-19 exposure while minimizing the unnecessary waste of PPE.",

Habib, DDS, MD -University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 can last for up to 3 hours in the air and up to 3 days on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel, so it is essential that OMSs utilize proper PPE and contamination control to protect themselves. 7,8 If possible, staff should use appropriate masks at all times, tight seal goggles and a face shield when treating patients. Staff should attempt to maintain 6 feet of distance between each other and non-treatment rooms (i.e. break rooms, clinical team rooms) should remain as clean zones where no contaminated PPE is worn. OMSs can make several workflow modifications in response to COVID-19. Emergency patients should be triaged initially by a central call line then a potential telehealth visit with the OMS to determine the need for care. It is important to note telemedicine can be coded via CPT codes 99421-99423 and teledentistry via D9995, though currently insurance reimbursement is limited with audio-only appointments. At each point of contact with the patient, screening for COVID-19 related symptoms should occur. During the telehealth visit, the provider should determine the appropriate treatment location. Procedures with minimal aerosolization such as minor infections, bleeding, lacerations, simple extractions and dentoalveolar trauma can be managed in an outpatient clinical setting, while more complex care with significant aerosolization are better managed within a hospital-based setting. The treatment protocol for any patients who are physically referred to the OMS clinic includes strict COVID-19 screening and modified procedures to minimize working time and exposures. For example, extractions should involve minimal manipulation with a throat screen. Incision and drainage should use slow irrigation with a high-speed suction. Lacerations should be treated with resorbable sutures when possible to avoid an additional in-person visit. Given the fluidity of the COVID-19 situation, particularly the availability of testing kits, the patient emergency treatment protocol should be continually revised to accommodate treatment for emergency patients while maintaining patient and OMS safety. Nerve Injury Management Vincent Ziccardi, DDS, MD, FACS -Rutgers School of Dental Medicine, Newark, USA Due to COVID-19, the Governor of New Jersey issued an executive order on March 23, 2020 to suspend all elective surgeries. 9 This led to a major reduction in surgical caseload, including most operations to repair nerve injuries. While there are certain indications, such as the presence of a foreign body causing chemical injury, that may necessitate emergency nerve microsurgery, most other planned nerve repairs have been postponed. Limited evidence suggests",

            "text": "Craniofacial Management David M. Yates, DMD, MD, FACS -El Paso Children's Hospital, El Paso, Texas, USA The management of cleft and craniofacial patients in OMS is largely in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (ACPA). On April 1, 2020, the ACPA released an official statement in response to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) nationwide suspension of non-emergent surgery amid the COVID-19 pandemic.While many cleft and craniofacial procedures are time sensitive and all providers must consider individual, patient, and hospital circumstances, the ACPA considers the safety of patients, surgeons, and multidisciplinary teams as priority. While multidisciplinary team care optimizes patient outcomes, in person team care visits are non-urgent and should be coordinated via telehealth to maintain social distancing and minimize viral spread. Speech language and pathology assessment of the patient using video endoscopy is considered non-urgent and should be delayed.Primary cleft lip repair should be delayed as there is no strong correlation between delaying primary lip repair and a negative impact on speech and feeding. Additionally, the use of nasoalveolar molding (NAM), while discouraged, should be considered on a case by case basis. Revision cleft lip and nose surgery is elective and should be delayed. Primary cleft palate repair should generally be delayed while pursuing non-surgical options for nutritional support. The increased risk for development of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) does not outweigh the viral infection. Similarly, delaying secondary VPI surgery is encouraged being that a delay in surgery of a few months is unlikely to significantly alter the final outcome on speech. When the suspension on elective surgeries is lifted, teams should prioritize cleft palate repairs, beginning with the oldest children first, followed by VPI surgeries. These recommendations may be amenable to change as preoperative COVID-19 testing becomes more available.Management of micrognathia in patients with Pierre Robin Sequence is considered essential as the physiology could pose a threat to the neonatal airway. Surgical management should be reserved to patients with persistent desaturations, inability to tolerate feeds, or severe sleep apnea. A preference for mandibular distraction over tracheotomy is encouraged.Tracheotomy is higher risk for spread of COVID-19. Orthognathic surgery is considered elective and must be delayed. In addition, patients with sleep apnea requiring orthognathic surgery should be managed with non-surgical modalities such as CPAP at this time.Currently, the ACPA has not provided any recommendations for management of craniosynostosis. Endoscopic craniosynostosis surgery is time-sensitive and therefore may beconsidered non-elective. Open craniosynostosis surgery is only performed at this time if the patient exhibits increased intracranial pressure or papilledema. It is important to note that the pandemic has also led to blood shortages and that open craniosynostosis repairs often require blood transfusions. Lastly, all pediatric pathology should proceed with biopsy of suspicious lesions. Definitive treatment should be based on the pathologic diagnosis and if possible, delayed as long as the lesion does not pose a threat to vital head and neck structures. Trauma Management Paul S. Tiwana, DDS, MS, MD, FACS -University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA Because COVID-19 poses a high risk to those working in the head and neck region, it is very important to protect OMSs and their teams. This is especially salient for OMSs managing trauma patients because many injuries are time sensitive. Relatedly, it is important for each OMS to be keenly aware of the bounds of their clinical proficiency so they can minimize exposure to themselves and their teams. There is no excuse for poor surgery despite any extra precautions that must be taken to minimize COVID-19 risk. Compromised surgical results would necessitate a re-operation, thus further increasing exposure risk and hurting patient outcomes. While there are currently no explicit definitions for the indications that necessitate emergency trauma treatment, patients with severe lacerations, bleeding, fractures, and airway compromise should be considered as candidates for surgery, as long the provider has adequate PPE or the patient has been appropriately COVID-19 tested. The AO CMF released a best practice guideline for maxillofacial procedures during the COVID-19 Pandemic on March 26, 2020. 13 General recommendations for OMSs on airway and surgical management of craniomaxillofacial trauma including the following principles: Airway Management \u2022 Anesthesia team should be minimized to the least personnel necessary \u2022 All unnecessary personnel should be outside the operating room during intubation and extubation to minimize exposure to aerosolized viral particles \u2022 Intubation is preferred over placement of laryngeal mask airway and should be performed using a video laryngoscope or by the most experienced member on the anesthesia team \u2022 If nasal intubation is required, should consider passing the endotracheal tube through the nose attached to a red rubber catheter to minimize mucosal trauma and aerosolization \u2022 Limit the amount of mask ventilation prior to intubation \u2022 Limit unnecessary suctioning of the nasal or oral cavity \u2022 Early use of paralytics and rapid sequence intubation to limit coughing \u2022 Consider submental intubation for surgical airway over tracheotomy when possible \u2022 If a tracheotomy is required, consider techniques to minimize aerosalization. Surgical Management \u2022 Surgical team should be minimized to the least personnel necessary \u2022 Preoperative disinfection of mucosal surfaces with povidone iodine, and draping off the nasal and oral cavities when feasible \u2022 Consider closed reduction of fractures over open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) where possible \u2022 If fracture requires ORIF, consider transcutaneous approach over transoral or transconjunctival approach \u2022 Consider delaying isolated anterior table frontal sinus fractures \u2022 Use of blade over monopolar cautery for mucosal incisions to minimize vaporization \u2022 Suture ligation over bipolar cautery over monopolar cautery when possible for hemostasis \u2022 Avoid repeated suctioning and irrigation \u2022 If ORIF is required, prefer monocortical fixation with self-drilling screws when appropriate \u2022 If surgery requires drilling and bicortical screws are required, consider a batter powered low speed drill \u2022 Use of osteo-/perio-tome or chisel instead of high-powered surgical handpiece for surgical extractions or osteotomies \u2022 If the sinus or mucous membranes are exposed during surgery, consider intraoperative disinfection with povidone iodine prior to further surgical manipulation. Cosmetic Management Joseph Niamtu, III, DMD -Niamtu Cosmetic Facial Surgery, Midlothian, Virginia, USAThe COVID-19 pandemic has also been a major disruptor in OMS practices with predominant cosmetic facial procedures. Cosmetic facial surgeries are elective in nature and have been delayed in accordance with CMS recommendations. Revenue from cosmetic procedures often falls outside the scope of medical reimbursement, and therefore, correlates with economic trends. Furthermore, true emergencies in cosmetic facial procedures are scarce. As a result, many pure cosmetic practices are closed.",

Suspension of all elective surgeries has decreased not only residents' OMS case volume but also has affected their anesthetic experience. Off-service rotations in medicine and general surgery, while minimally disrupted in volume, have largely shifted their attention to patients with acute medical or surgical needs. All OMS didactics and conferences are being held virtually via teleconference. For residents in medical training, all clinic activities during clerkships and electives have been suspended with emphasis on didactics via teleconference and distance learning. The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step exams have been canceled through May 31, 2020. Likewise, the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Inservice Training Examination (OMSITE), which is typically offered in spring annually, has also been postponed.

Aziz, DMD, MD, FACS, FRCSEd -Rutgers School of Dental Medicine, Newark, New Jersey, USA A twenty questions survey was sent out to OMSs in New Jersey at the end of February 2020. The survey, which had a response rate of 125/332 (53.8%) gathered provider opinions and feedback regarding COVID-19. For the first three weeks of March, the majority of OMSs (60%) conducted emergency treatments only. Close to 75% of respondents did not have N95 masks available. Relatedly, 40% of respondents would still treat emergency patients without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). Since the survey date, however, New Jersey has witnessed an exponential growth in the severity of COVID-19. The initial response to COVID-19 created a shift to emergency only treatments, especially with the limitations in PPE availability. Institutional COVID-19 Modifications Thomas B.

Glickman, DMD -NYU Langone Health, New York, USA; Guiqing Liao, DDS, MD -Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China; Vincent Ziccardi, DDS, MD, FACS -Rutgers School of Dental Medicine, Newark, USA Healthcare systems have adapted policies and guidelines to prioritize the acute medical needs of the population, to decrease the inpatient census and divert resources projected to be scarce and to promote stewardship in proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Elective surgeries and all non-essential procedures have been deferred and postponed based on crisis based clinical decision making without negative impact on the surgical outcome or the disease process. Many institutions have expanded their usage of telemedicine to include triage of emergency patients and continuation of necessary care of established patients. Occupational Exposure Risks Thomas B.
