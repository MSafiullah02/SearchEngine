There were 575 ARIs identified from 301 children completing the study, at a rate of 1.04 per child-month. Swabs collected during an ARI were positive for a respiratory virus in 76.8% (307 of 400), compared with 37.3% (79 of 212) of swabs collected during asymptomatic periods. The most common viruses detected were human rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza viruses, influenzavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. All of these were significantly more likely to be detected during ARIs than asymptomatic periods.

A similarly designed household surveillance study showed that weekly detections of viruses in young (aged <5) and older (aged 5-17) children were significantly more frequent than in adults. 20 In the current study swabs were taken at the onset of illness, when viral load reportedly peaks for some respiratory viruses. 21 It is possible that this method is more likely to detect viruses associated with ARI than other studies obtaining weekly swabs. Sample sizes of each virus detected here were too small to compare individual viruses between age groups. However, a multi-country community surveillance study has previously shown that with the exception of influenza, prevalence of individual respiratory viruses was highest in younger children. 3 The rates of ARI per child-month were similar between age groups, suggesting that other factors such as development of allergy may play a more significant role than age in acute respiratory health.",

Consistent with previous reports in the Southern Hemisphere RSV peaked in this pediatric population in early winter. 4, 22 Interestingly, we found a similar pattern for detection of HCoV. It has recently been reported in China that while overall HCoV infection is most prevalent in winter, HCoV subtypes display different epidemic patterns. 23 As only a small number of HCoVs were detected (n = 50), we did not distinguish between subtypes when reporting our results. Influenza was detected from June to October and peaked in July. A limitation was that no data were collected for the summer and autumn periods, capturing only the times of highest respiratory virus activity. This may account for the low detection of AdV, HBoV, and EV in comparison to other year-round epidemiological studies. 24 A yearround analyses may also allow for investigation of phenomena such as the February back to school HRV peaks. 25 Our study differs from a previous NZ-based analysis of viruses in hospitalized children with LRTI, 22 where relatively high rates of RSV (39%) and HMPV (7%) were detected. In our community-based study, incidence of these viruses was considerably lower. Previous groups have reported that RSV and HMPV rarely occur in asymptomatic subjects, 11, 26, 27 suggesting that detection of these viruses is almost always of clinical relevance. IFV may be present in people with few or no symptoms. However, the duration and copy number of viral shedding is considerably lower in these cases, 28 and further research is needed to understand the contribution of asymptomatic detection to community transmission. In the present study, we found these viruses in very few samples of asymptomatic subjects, and demonstrated these three viruses (and others) to be significantly associated with ARIs.",

At the beginning of the study period, participants were visited in their homes where researchers obtained written consent and a record of current and previous health using a standard questionnaire. Parents were trained to recognize respiratory symptoms, and were instructed to keep a daily symptom diary for 8 weeks. A modified Jackson (1958) severity score was used to construct the symptom diary. Symptoms tracked included sneezing, sore throat, runny nose, cough, fevers, aches or pains, unwell/off-color, and wheezing. Each symptom was graded on a 0 to 3 severity scale, with 0 being no symptoms, 1 being mild symptoms, 2 moderate symptoms, and 3 severe symptoms. Researchers also trained parents in the collection of nasal swabs (FLOQ pediatric swabs, COPAN UTM transport media, COPAN Diagnostics Inc., Murrieta, CA) which were to be taken when visible mucus was first produced during episodes of respiratory symptoms, and then stored upright in the participant\u02bcs freezer until collection at the end of the study. At the conclusion of the study period all participants were again visited in their homes, where symptom diaries and nasal swabs were collected, and a final nasal swab was taken by researchers. Swabs were transported frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C at the University of Otago, Wellington. Frozen swabs were transported to Virology Research Laboratory, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney at the end of each viral season.",

Our parent-administered surveillance of healthy children provides insight into the community epidemiology of respiratory viruses during the winter and spring seasons in New Zealand. This cohort demonstrates infection with viruses, particularly HRV, is common in symptomatic and asymptomatic children. More than one-third of swabs taken when children were asymptomatic were positive for a virus, although specific viruses (HRV-A, HRV-C, IFV, HCoV, RSV, HMPV, PIF, and EV) are more likely to be associated with symptomatic ARIs. This suggests pathogenesis of infection differs between viruses, and indicates the need for further biomarkers of pathology in these infections.",

Population based surveillance is important in assessing morbidity and determining the role of viruses in ARIs. Previously in New Zealand, the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) project has reported on influenza and other respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients and those seeking health care for acute respiratory illness. 15,16 The community-wide epidemiology of respiratory viruses is less well established. This study determined rates of virus detection in ARIs, and reports on the epidemiology of respiratory viruses amongst a community cohort of children in this region. 2 | METHODS 2.1 | Study population and enrolment As part of a He Kainga Oranga Housing and Health Research Programme funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand, the Rhinovirus study was conducted to examine the impacts of bedroom temperature on young children's respiratory health in the greater Wellington region (Central Wellington, Porirua, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt), New Zealand. Ethical approval was received from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee (12/CEN/60). Participants were recruited by recontact via letter from a previous study, 17 selfreferral by parents from posters in medical facilities, from popular press articles, referral by friends and family, or by electronic messaging to district health board mailing lists. A screening questionnaire was used to determine the eligibility of children aged 1 to 8. Of 372 children screened for participation, 305",
