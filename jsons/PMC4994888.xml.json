Culture and molecular-based testing (PCR) are two of the most widely available high sensitivity testing methods for RV that are currently used by healthcare providers caring for immunocompromised patients. Although testing method does not affect length of shedding, using PCR versus culture testing may affect detection of extended shedding. Though PCR is a faster, more sensitive diagnostic tool than culture, it does not differentiate between actively replicating and non-viable organisms. Moreover, viral culture success depends on many factors, including sample collection and storage conditions, virus type, viral load and cell line. Although a positive virus culture may be indicative of a viable virus, a negative result does not necessarily indicate absence of viable virus. Hence, test of cure and isolation policies for RV-positive patients remain unclear.",

This finding is of particular relevance in this population because asymptomatic shedders have been suspected to be the source of nosocomial outbreaks caused by PIV and RSV. Observational data from recent outbreaks in high-risk settings suggest that extension of contact and droplet precautions through the entire duration of shedding (as detected by PCR) is an essential strategy for outbreak prevention and control for these two viruses [9], [10], [11], [17], [18]. Interestingly, shedding patterns of influenza virus were similar among the culture and PCR cohorts and may be influenced by the early use of antiviral agents with PCR testing. Oseltamivir was widely used in both the study periods regardless of timing of diagnosis from symptom onset; this is the current standard of care for management of influenza at our institution. PCR enables an early diagnosis and treatment compared with viral culture and it is plausible that early initiation of antivirals reduces the period of contagiousness. Our data support this notion, although validation in a prospectively designed study is needed.",
