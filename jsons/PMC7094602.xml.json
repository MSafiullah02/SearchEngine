            "text": "The fth1 \u201c88\u201d phage display vector contains two copies of protein VIII genes, one wild type and the other recombinant (Fig. 1; see Ref. [12]). Peptide display is based on insertion of foreign sequences into the recombinant copy of the protein VIII gene between two SfiI sites separated by a DNA sequence coding for two stop codons followed by a trpA transcription terminator, all of which displace the reading frame by 1 nucleotide [12] (Fig. 1). Hence, prior to insertion of a foreign sequence between the two SfiI sites, no recombinant protein VIII is produced and the phages display only wild-type protein VIII. Due to the presence of the SfiI insertion cassette, recombinant protein VIIIs contain a discriminating sequence not found in wild-type proteins (Fig. 1). In view of this, it was proposed that the N-terminal 7 residues of recombinant protein VIII (AEGGQRG), which contain the first SfiI-encoded unique sequence (GQRG), could serve as a universal endogenous antibody tag for all recombinant versions of the protein regardless of length or composition of the peptide being displayed. Because most of our random peptide libraries often contain flanking cysteine residues to generate constrained looped random peptides, we decided to include the first cysteine residue as amino acid 8 in the GIL to be tested (AEGGQRGC). Once designed, it was then necessary to produce fusion proteins that display the GIL to be used as immunogens. For this, the GIL-encoding sequences (GIL inserts) were cloned into the asymmetric AvaI site (CTCGGG) found in the modified MBP expression vector pMalC-133-AvaI (see Materials and Methods). We previously demonstrated that cloning inserts into such AvaI sites drives the formation of tandem repeats of the inserts in the proper reading frame and orientation [15]. This is due to the fact that the internal asymmetry of the restriction site generates two different 5\u2032 overhangs, thereby forcing compatible inserts to clone in only one orientation. Clones containing two, three, and four linear GIL insert repeats were isolated and confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 2\n). The clone containing three tandem repeats was selected and used for MBP\u2013GIL fusion protein production, which in turn was used to immunize rabbits. The resulting polyclonal serum was tested for specific binding to the GIL.",

The first phage expresses the 1B6 peptide on recombinant protein VIII and is a type 88 chimeric phage. The second phage type displays the 1B6 peptide on all copies of protein III. It should be noted that only insert expression on recombinant protein VIII generates the GIL sequence. Fig. 3 depicts a representative ELISA experiment illustrating that GIL\u2013Ab efficiently binds only the phages displaying the 1B6 peptide on recombinant protein VIII and shows no binding to phages displaying the same sequence on protein III or to the wild-type fth1 phages. The 1B6 mAb binds both phages displaying the 1B6 peptide, on both protein VIII and protein III, but to a lesser degree corresponding to the fewer copies of protein III as compared with recombinant protein VIII. Polyclonal rabbit anti-M13 antibodies bound all three phages at similar levels, illustrating equal overall phage levels for all three phage types. These results indicate that all three phage types are present in equal amounts, that the 1B6 peptide is displayed on both the protein VIII and protein III phages, yet only recombinant protein VIII is recognized by GIL\u2013Ab.",

In this manner, we generated a series of phage mixtures containing identical total phage concentrations but with ever decreasing amounts of phages displaying the 1B6 peptide. As shown in Fig. 4\n, binding signals from polyclonal rabbit anti-M13 antibodies remained constant, confirming the equal total phage concentrations. In contrast, however, binding signals from both GIL\u2013Ab and 1B6 mAb dropped in a very similar manner as the concentration of 1B6 peptide presenting phages decreased, illustrating the similar detection sensitivity of both reagents and the correlation between the presence of the 1B6 peptide and the generation of the GIL in recombinant protein VIII. In experiments where both antibodies are reacted simultaneously to 1B6 displaying phages, binding of 1B6 mAb competes and interferes with GIL\u2013Ab binding and vice versa, as to be expected (data not shown).",

Table 1\nis a list of 12 different peptide inserts validated for display on protein VIII using GIL\u2013Ab and the relevant anti-insert antibodies. The peptides range in length from 7 to 43 residues, some of them contain flanking cysteine residues and others do not, and together they represent reasonable cover of amino acid compositions. Validation of peptide expression was carried out by phage ELISA (see Materials and Methods). Each of the phages displaying the listed peptides was tested for binding to both GIL\u2013Ab and the anti-insert antibody listed as compared with wild-type fth1 phages. All 12 peptide displaying phages gave high binding signals to both GIL\u2013Ab and the corresponding anti-insert antibodies, whereas only background binding was observed using the wild-type fth1 phages (data not shown). The fact that peptides not flanked by cysteine residues are recognized by GIL\u2013Ab shows that the cysteine residue is not essential for binding. In addition, peptide 12 is also missing Gly7 of the GIL sequence. Nevertheless, GIL\u2013Ab binds this construct efficiently. Hence, the first 6 GIL residues (AEGGQR) are the core GIL\u2013Ab epitope, with some flexibility as to the sequence at the C terminus of the GIL. Over the past year, we have successfully used GIL\u2013Ab as a general insert label detector for a wide variety of inserted sequences, showing GIL\u2013Ab to be a general detector of recombinant protein VIII regardless of the nature of the displayed sequence.",

In studying the polyclonal serum response against HCV core protein, we used three recombinant phages, each expressing a different peptide on protein VIII and designated cores 1, 2, and 3 (see Materials and Methods). Sequencing confirmed that all three phages contained the expected DNA inserts in the proper reading frame. However, when tested against polyclonal serum from a patient positive for HCV (Fig. 5\n), core 1 consistently gave a strong signal, core 3 gave a weaker but clearly detectable signal, and core 2 gave no response at all. The initial conclusion could be that the core 2 peptide is apparently not an efficient antigen and little activity against this epitope is detectable in the patient\u2019s serum. However, lack of activity could be explained by inappropriate peptide conformation despite its being displayed efficiently by phage protein VIII [16], [17], [18], [19]. Testing the binding of GIL\u2013Ab to these phages is extremely revealing. Phages cores 1 and 3 gave strong GIL\u2013Ab responses, illustrating that although the peptides are equally well expressed and assembled in the phages, the HCV serum response to each is quite different. This is not surprising because the HCV serum was derived from a patient infected with HCV subtype 1a (core 3 represents a subtype 3 peptide). Surprisingly, no GIL\u2013Ab response could be demonstrated for the core 2 phage, whose signal was no better than that of wild-type phage. Hence, the absence of signal with the HCV serum is first and foremost due to lack of expression, assembly, and display of the core 2 peptide, and conclusions regarding immunogenicity or proper peptide conformation cannot be drawn based on this phage system. Here GIL\u2013Ab proved to be a critical reagent\u2014a sensor of sorts for the confirmation that recombinant protein VIII is expressed and assembled.",

Polyclonal antibodies that specifically bind the N terminus of recombinant protein VIII (GIL\u2013Ab) were produced and shown to be capable of binding a variety of recombinant protein VIIIs displaying different peptide inserts. Thus, the use of GIL\u2013Ab provides a single reagent that enables the monitoring of chimeric phages produced using the fth1 vector. Because phage display libraries are used extensively for diagnostic purposes and as tools for vaccine research [20], [21], [22] (reviewed in Refs. [23], [24]), validating the presence of the displayed peptide is of utmost importance for minimizing false-negative results caused by difficult-to-display sequences.",
