Almost 2 billion people travel by air every year,1, 2 and physicians are now expected to identify individuals unfit for air travel and give them advice. More than 95% of individuals with health problems who have to travel by air would like to receive more medical advice from their physician.3 Also, the age of travellers is increasing and long-haul aircrafts\u2014such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 LR\u2014are now capable of extending flight times to 18\u201320 h; therefore, an increasing number of travellers with various underlying medical conditions could face environmental and physiological changes associated with the flight. Here, we review the health issues associated with commercial air travel.",

Most regulatory governmental agencies require the cabin altitude not to exceed 2438 m.4, 5, 6 Most healthy individuals tolerate this cabin pressure; however, a study of adult volunteers simulating a 20-h flight showed that the frequency of reported complaints associated with acute mountain sickness (fatigue, headache, lightheadedness, and nausea) increased with increasing altitude and peaked at 2438 m, with most symptoms becoming apparent after 3\u20139 h of exposure.7 Cabin pressurisation to 2438 m reduces the atmospheric pressure of the cabin, resulting in a concomitant decrease of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) from 95 mm Hg to 60 mm Hg at the maximum cabin altitude of 2438 m.8 In healthy passengers, these pressures lead to a 3\u20134% decrease in systemic oxyhaemoglobin saturation (the corresponding PaO2 value remains within the flat portion of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve) (figure\n).5, 7 However, many passengers with pre-existing cardiac, pulmonary, and haematological conditions have a reduced baseline PaO2, so reduced cabin pressure leads to further reduction of oxygen saturation, which lowers further with increasing flight times (figure).8, 9 The decreased oxygen saturation can exacerbate medical conditions.2, 4, 9, 10 For example, a recent prospective observational study showed that 18% of passengers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have at least mild respiratory distress during a flight.11\n",

The Aerospace Medical Association (AsMa) guidelines suggest sea-level blood gas determination or pulmonary-function testing with hypoxic-challenge testing as the gold standard, and recommend in-flight oxygen for individuals with a sea-level PaO2 of 70 mm Hg or lower, or with an expected in-flight PaO2 of 55 mm Hg or lower.10 However, some evidence suggests that these guidelines might need revision because predictive equations often inaccurately estimate in-flight PaO2.2, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16 Additionally, recent work has shown that initial sea-level oxygen saturation poorly identifies individuals at risk of desaturation below 90% during either hypoxic-challenge testing in the laboratory17, 18 or routine commercial flights.15, 17 No studies that assess individuals with heart failure during commercial air travel exist; however, several small studies have shown that people with chronic heart failure tolerate altitudes up to 2500\u20133000 m.19, 20 BTS or AsMa guidelines should be followed with patients affected by heart failure who have to travel by air.Panel 1Assessment of in-flight PaO2\nHypoxic-challenge test (hypoxia altitude simulation test):\nThe maximum cabin altitude of 2438 m can be simulated at sea level with a gas mixture containing 15% oxygen in nitrogen. Individuals breathe the hypoxic gas mixture for 20 min while oxygen saturation is monitored. Arterial blood gases are also measured before and at the end of the test. An individual needs in-flight oxygen if PaO2 falls below 50 mm Hg or if the oxygen saturation measured via pulse oximetry falls below 85%.\nPredictive Dillard equations:\nPaO2 at altitude can be estimated with several published predictive equations, which use values of ground-level PaO2 and lung-function measurements to predict in-flight PaO2:\n\u2022In-flight PaO2=0\u00b7453\u00d7ground-level PaO2 (mm Hg)+0\u00b7386 (FEV1% predicted)+2\u00b744\u2022In-flight PaO2=0\u00b7519\u00d7ground-level PaO2 (mm Hg)+11\u00b7855\u00d7FEV1 (L)\u22121\u00b7760\n",

Compressed oxygen supplied by the airline is available for individuals with a physician's statement of need and prescription. Since 2005, portable oxygen concentrators, which concentrate oxygen in ambient air by removing nitrogen content, have become available as an alternative to traditional oxygen cylinders. Passengers should possess a signed doctor's statement of medical need and notify the airline of their intention to use portable oxygen concentrators before travelling.21 Because of a modification in the US Government Air Carrier Access Act in May, 2008, all US-based air carriers and foreign air carrier flights that begin or end in the USA have to accommodate passengers who need portable oxygen concentrators.22\n",

However, passengers who have undergone recent surgical procedures are at increased risk of problems related to gas expansion, and many anecdotal reports, including those of bowel perforation24 and wound dehiscence,25 have been published. Guidelines recommend delaying air travel for 14 days after major surgical procedures.10, 23 Individuals with bowel obstructions or diverticulitis are advised to wait 7\u201310 days before air travel.10, 23\n",

This reduced pressure within the passenger cabin results in lower systemic PaO2 and decreased oxyhaemoglobin. For most healthy passengers, this results in a decrease in the arterial partial pressure oxygen tension from 95 mm Hg (12\u00b77 kPa) to 65 mm Hg (8\u00b77 kPa) corresponding to an oxyhaemoglobin saturation from 95\u2013100% at sea level (A) to 90% at a cabin altitude of 2438 m (B). (B) Passengers with pre-existing lower sea-level oxyhaemoglobin saturations have greater declines during a flight. In this example, a passenger with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a sea-level PaO2 of 70 mm Hg (A) and a FEV1 of 1\u00b76 L (50% predicted) will have a corresponding reduction of PaO2 to about 53 mm Hg or oxyhaemoglobin saturation of approximately 84% at a cabin altitude of 2438 m (B). This passenger should be prescribed oxygen for air travel. PaO2=arterial oxygen partial pressure. FEV1=forced expiratory effort in 1 second.",
