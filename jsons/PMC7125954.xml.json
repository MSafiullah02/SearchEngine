            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of Coronaviridae, is the etiological agent of entero-pathogenic diarrhea in swine [1], [2], [3]. Although the clinical symptoms of PEDV infection are similar to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection, PEDV has a wider variety of clinical signs in pigs [4]. Propagation of PEDV in vitro was rather limited until Vero cells were found to support the growth of virus in the presence of trypsin [5]. In this study, we described the derivation of an attenuated strain of PEDV, as a potential vaccine candidate, through cell adaptation.",

The isolate of PEDV was originated from a neonatal pig and plaque purified in Vero cells. The isolate, designated KPEDV-9, was passaged in 80\u201390% monolayers of Vero cells in alpha-MEM with 0.02% yeast extract, 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) and 1\u20132 \u03bcg of trypsin as described [5], [6]. Sequential passages of the virus were normally conducted in roller culture. Each passage level of virus was stored at \u221270\u00b0C or freeze-dried with equal volume of stabilizer (0.217 M Lactose, 0.0038 M KHPO4, 0.0072 M K2HPO4, 0.0049 M monosodium glutamate, 1% Gelatin). The final stock of the PEDV was characterized in two ways. Firstly, the culture supernatant was subjected to direct centrifugation at 60,000\u00d7g for 2 h and the pellet was resuspended to 1/200 of initial volume for morphological identification by transmission electron microscopy. Secondly, the virus infected cells were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect specific PEDV sequences. Three primers for RT-PCR were selected from the sequences information of membrane protein (M) gene of Duarte et al. [7]. P1 (27mer); 5\u2032\u2013CCCCAGTACTGTTATTGACGTATAAAC\u20133\u2032 (position 974\u20131000), P2 (24mer); 5\u2032\u2013GTTTAGACTAAATGAAGCACTTTC\u20133\u2032 (position 1665\u20131688) for PCR and P3 (25mer); 5\u2032\u2013GCCATAAAGTTTCTGTTTAGACTAA\u20133\u2032 (1702\u20131678) as the primer for synthesis of complementary DNA, respectively. The extraction of RNA and RT-PCR were conducted according to the instructions of commercially available kit (Stratagene). PCR reactions were performed in the conditions as described previously [8]. After amplification, the PCR products were cloned into pUC19 vector for sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0 (USB, USA). In addition, the presence of adventitious virus such as porcine parvovirus (PPV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Hog cholera virus (HCV) and other cythopathogenic viruses were examined as described previously [9], [10], [11].",

The intestine was ground in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4).

Briefly, the dilution of antigen and second antibodies were adjusted to the optical density (OD) around 0.2 (A 490) using the negative porcine sera.

The reacted plate was washed again at the same condition and incubated with 2000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labelled anti-porcine IgG (KPL) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C.

After serial passages in Vero cells, the growth of virus was rather trypsin-independent and the detection of cytopathic effect (CPE) was rather variable, depending on clones of Vero cell lines (data not presented here). Since the SPF or gnotobiotic piglets were not used in this experiment, it might not reasonable to figure out the exact differences in pathogenicity between the wild and the attenuated virus. Nevertheless, when compared with the wild PEDV, the animals inoculated with the high passage level of virus did not show any severe signs of diarrhea or death in piglets, supporting attenuation.",

Previously, we found that PEDV infections were related to more than 20% of diarrheal cases in the neonatal pigs, thus causing a considerable losses in pig industry [13]. In fact, field application of attenuated virus as vaccine resulted in the overall reduction of mortality of neonatal pigs (2\u201352% compared with before vaccination) in the farms having PEDV outbreak [16]. Nevertheless, it is worthy to note that the efficacy of protection was rather complicated and conflicting according to the challenge dose like other enteric diseases. Although the pregnant pigs inoculated with attenuated virus showed the increased immune status by ELISA as compared to uninoculated control, it is difficult to explain the exact relation to mucosal immunity for protection. Since it was well confirmed that the mechanisms of the passive immunity are extensively related to the presence of IgA and IgM antibodies [17], further experiments, including detection of antibody secreting cells of IgA and IgM, may give the practical information for immunoprophylaxis against PEDV.",
