Although conceptually appealing and supported by experimental animal studies, the clinical link between RVs and these indirect effects has not been clearly assessed. Key limitations have been the low number and incompleteness of events, the heterogeneity of study populations and diagnostic tools, and the frequently retrospective nature of the published reports 8.",

Although we did not statistically control for other effects, the results of our investigation support this notion.

Our methodological strategy has been used in other prospective studies 1, 11, and the probability of this error is very unlikely because the infection rates are the highest described in the medical literature until now 7, 8, 11. Third, the spirometric outcomes were evaluated according to clinical lung allograft surveillance without a protocol after RV sampling; therefore, we missed functional tests, and that likely biased the observed decline in FEV1.
