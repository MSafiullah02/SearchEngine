There is no direct link between gene expression and glycan endproducts. The structure and composition of glycans are guided by sophisticated batteries of biosynthetic enzymes operating principally within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi complex or the plasma membrane and this is the reason why unveiling the enigma of carbohydrate biobuilders is an extremely daunting task. The development of this new search engine has unmasked various pieces of information, which were not previously easily obtainable. Currently, one can investigate various carbohydrate interactions for their use for medical purposes (Table 1).\n",

However, generating a large-scale combinatorial carbohydrate library is a very difficult task, associated with a variety of problematic issues. Using conventional chromatographic techniques such as ion exchange chromatography, the purification of stereoisomers is difficult and blood-derived samples are usually associated with problems such as rapid degradation and erythrocyte agglutination. Since the efficiency of immobilization on a surface is directly proportional to the molecular mass of the biomolecules, only oligosaccaride and polysaccharide preparations can be used. The first carbochip approach by Wang et al. (3) was much more feasible for polysaccharide preparations, which were covered by nitrocellulose-coated glass slides. Using the same approach, Wang et al. (4) raised the issue of the involvement of autoimmune responses in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

            "text": "In the neoglycolipid technology applied by Fukui et al. (5), lipid isolation and manipulation is extremely difficult. To overcome these problems, the laboratory synthesis of sugars was attempted. However, it is currently impractical to synthesize the full complement of known sequences in animals such as O- and N-glycans of glycoproteins, diverse sequences of glycolipids and glycosaminoglycans (6). Terminal saccharide units are initially recognized by proteins, but it is very difficult to maintain the closed ring structure and the anomericity (e.g., \u03b1 and \u03b2 anomeric configurations) of terminal saccharide units during chemical synthesis. Mizuno et al. (7) postulated that immobilization of the glycosyl amino acids allowed the preparation of glycochips that maintained the whole structure of the oligosaccharide. There are branched chain structures in many carbohydrates. The cluster effect (mass affinity due to multivalency) is another significant issue during solid-phase synthesis. Simultaneous multiple selective protection, deprotection and maintaining the blocking efficiency at each step is a prerequisite for the multivalent morphology of sugar structures. This mass affinity is the major obstruction for correct spacing, correct orientation and uniform densities of the fabricated sugar frameworks. It can be considered as a huge barrier to the regular and homogeneous microenvironment that results in lower biological activity and low solvent accessibility of the arrayed samples. High cost and the limited availability of enzymes (e.g., galactosyltransferase) is commonly associated with the enzymatic synthesis of glycan molecules and until now no one has developed a highly efficient genetically modified biological system for the production of carbohydrate molecules. Fazio et al. (8) implemented the cycloaddition reactions between azides and alkynes. They used carbohydrate arrays to study known inhibitors of the fucosyltransferase (FucT) enzyme, whereas Bryan et al. (9) used the same array technique for the screening of a library of possible FucT inhibitors.",

The analytical glycotechnology core of the CFG is focusing on the development and application of ultra-high sensitivity mass spectrometric strategies for the characterization of glycoproteins, which will also allow the identification of isomers that have the same molecular weight but different structures. To avoid the confusion of nomenclature, Glycominds generated a syntax that describes the branched structures of glycans as linear computer-friendly mathematical formulae (10).",

It is also necessary for the identification of appropriate functional groups, which can promote permanent and quantitative immobilization of target molecules in defined orientations. The linker molecule hypothesis initially proposed by Park and Shin (11) can be readily adapted for diverse categories of substances such as silicon, glass, plastic, metal, fiber optics, filter membranes and so on. Linkers of suitable size make use of whole-cell glycan for correct interaction with the species to be detected and are also helpful in avoiding nonspecific adsorption. The approach proposed by Houseman and Mrksich (12) has significantly reduced the background noise and is principally based on a mixture of two alkanethiols. Ratner et al. (13) also observed very high signal-to-noise ratios in their study. The conjugation strategy followed by Adams et al. (14) achieved adequate spacing between the underlying polymer support and the attached carbohydrate molecules. It also resulted in maintenance of the concentration of immobilized carbohydrate probes. Guo et al. (15) also followed the same strategy and demonstrated that dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3) grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN-related have distinct ligand-binding properties.",

The array will be highly reproducible (plate to plate, well to well and batch to batch reproducibility), stable and it will be possible to dry-store it for several months. Novel surface slides generated by Willats et al. (16) were stored for three months at room temperature. The array protocol conducted by Schwarz et al. (17) was much more reproducible. Su et al. (18) also followed the same strategy and demonstrated the presence of an alpha-anomeric glycosidic linkage contributing to the high-affinity binding of cognate oligosaccharide ligands. Nimrichter et al. (19) followed the same strategy and extended the applicability of glycan microarrays to detect and quantify the specific adhesion of intact cells to covalent carbohydrate microarrays engineered on glass slides. By this methodology, carbohydrate specificity could be screened on primary cells without purifying and expressing the relevant lectin(s). This indicates that both protein\u2013carbohydrate and carbohydrate\u2013carbohydrate interactions are amenable to cell-based microarray studies. Up-to-date fabrication strategies and modern printing methods will need to be developed very soon because it is a major shortcoming to maintain the printing load (higher printing load rapidly degrades the saccharide molecules). It is also strategic to formulate suitable software for data normalization. For the detection strategies, the critical point is how precisely weak interactions can be determined and this is the major reason why current techniques are giving low quantitative performances. Lectin\u2013sugar interactions are relatively weaker when compared with antigen\u2013antibody interactions (20). Adams et al. (21) demonstrated the potential of carbohydrate microarray analysis by probing the carbohydrate affinity and structural requirements of four well-known and relevant glycoprotein 120 (gp120) binding proteins, and scytovirin, a novel HIV-inactivating protein. Such studies provide vital information for designing vaccines that give immune responses to HIV infection.",

The identification of glycosylated peptides is generally carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS or LC/MS fingerprint analysis, whereas the location of modified amino acids can be obtained from fragmentation spectra generated by nano-electrospray ionization/MS/MS or LC-MS/MS analysis. For more comprehensive characterization of glycoproteins, direct MS-based approaches, such as glyco-catching can be applied (22). In this methodology, sequential lectin affinity columns are used for glycopeptide enrichment, which are further resolved by trimethylsilyl reversed phase HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF or Edman degradation. This method may further be coupled with database searching. Alternatively, another MS based technique termed \u03b2 elimination followed by Michael addition with dithiothreitol (BEMAD) can also be used for the identification of O-GlcNAc-modified sites (23). This in vitro methodology relies on mild \u03b2 elimination followed by Michael addition with DTT. This method is suitable for the quantification of glycosylation by mass spectrometry.

Modulates various processes such as adhesion, activation, migration and cell to cell signaling which bears fruit in terms of fertilization, development, differentiation, transformation, apoptosis and immune response (e.g., wounded tissue stimulates endothelial cells to express selectins for the recruitment of white blood cells). 4, Protein integrity. Involved in protein folding, 3D structure maintenance and trafficking of proteins (e.g., glycosylation assists by forming a tag for protein targeting). 5, Host-pathogen interaction. Pathogenic aliens mimic various glycans which are usually located on the outer surface of cellular communities and thus they take advantage of this to cause infection and pathogenesis (e.g., Helicobactor pylori).",

Schematic representation of carbohydrate microarray technology used in various experimental protocols for sugar analysis: (a) Quantification of saccharides. Single-source isolates containing different saccharide molecules can be quantified in parallel. Immobilized samples are further detected by labeled detection species. Comparative analysis with the control spots (positive and negative) and calibration spots produce accurate signal quantification. (b) Comparative analysis of saccharides. In the realm of pathological and morphological studies, different isolates for particular saccharides can be compared with the help of labeled binding partners. These primary arrays are further subjected to cross-matched analysis for comparison. (c) In neoglycolipid technology, deconvolution strategies with TLC and mass spectrometry have been applied for the assignment of carbohydrate sequences recognized by carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBP). This strategy has been exploited for ligand-positive components. All the information collected from the above strategies can be further processed for computational analysis.",
