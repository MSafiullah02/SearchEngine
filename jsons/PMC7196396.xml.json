Not surprisingly, this has had a tremendous effect on tourism. It is estimated that it will take to tourism almost one year to recover from these losses (Faus, 2020). While it is impossible for tourists to visit museums, parks, or other touristic destinations, because of the Covid-19 lockdown policies, we suggest that there is still a light of hope: virtual tours.",

Research on Terror Management Theory (Solomon, Greenberg, & Pyszczynski, 1991) suggests that mortality threat affects behavior in several ways: by lowering life satisfaction, well-being, or meaning in life (Burke, Martens, & Faucher, 2010). However, being exposed to something that is important to one's self-esteem can provide relief to mortality threats (Pyszczynski, Greenberg, & Solomon, 1999). Moreover, people have more positive attitudes towards brands or products that provide them relief from mortality threats (e.g., Sarial-Abi, Vohs, Hamilton, & Ulqinaku, 2017). We extend these findings in the tourism context, because mortality threats can prevent people from traveling (Fennell, 2017). Moreover, providing solutions to tourism during a struggling, uncertain, and threatening time is crucial and critical (Ritchie & Jiang, 2019).",

A principal component analysis reveals that the scale is unidimensional, and it shows a high level of reliability (\u03b1 = 0.72). Afterwards, participants were reminded that due to the social distance policies, which prevents tourists from visiting museums, some of them were offering virtual tours. Hence, they were randomly assigned to one of the virtual tours (interactive, control A, control B).",

While we hope that these events do not happen in the future, people can be reminded of fear of death in numerous situations, by reading the newspaper, by watching the news, or simply by reading a book or watching a money where the main character dies. Given that mortality salience can affect such a broad array of human behavior, and it can also affect consumer behavior, we believe that it is important to extend this in tourism, offering some initial insights on their relationship and calling for future research on these topics.",
