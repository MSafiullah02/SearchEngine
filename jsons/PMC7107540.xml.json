One approach is landline telephone number-based random digit dialing (Kish 1965; Cochran 1977). Although this method is very efficient for sampling, incomplete population coverage has been an issue (Groves et al. 2009). Approximately 3\u20135% of the households in the United States do not have a landline telephone and thus are not included in the sampling frame (Groves et al. 2009). People living in these households are more likely to be low in socioeconomic status, drug users, sex workers, and/or undocumented migrants (Groves et al. 2009; Singh and Clark 2012), all of whom are at increased risk for poor health. More threatening than incomplete coverage is the replacement of landline telephones by wireless communication technologies that makes it impossible to implement the random digital dialing method.",

However, such data are often not available in a timely manner in all developed countries and unavailable in many resource-limited lower- and middle-income countries. In developed countries, census data are collected only for selected years (usually five or ten years apart), and many resource-limited countries do not collect population census data on a regular basis. Even if census data are available, they may fail to count people who are at high risk for poor health, such as temporary and undocumented immigrants (Groves et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2012).",

In this case, methods are readily available to draw probability samples, such as the multi-stage random sampling methods for national in-household surveys supported by census data (Cochran 1977), telephone surveys supported by random digit dialing with published telephone numbers (Groves et al. 2009), and school surveys using system sampling methods with complete lists of schools and classes (Eaton, Kann, Kinchen, Shanklin, Flint et al. 2012). However, sometimes the sampling frame for a study population may be clear conceptually but hard to define operationally. Challenging examples for drawing probability samples include mobile migrants, sex workers, drug users, and persons living with HIV (Groves et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2012).",

Typical examples include studies of outbreaks and vaccination of infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Tong 2005; He, Zhuang, Zhao, Dong, Peng et al. 2007), Ebola (Weyer, Grobbelaar, and Blumberg 2015; Boisen, Hartnett, Goba, Vandi, Grant et al. 2016), and Zika (Boeuf, Drummer, Richards, Scoullar, and Beeson 2016; Deseda 2017). Innovative methods have been attempted for timely sampling without using a sampling frame. Well-known examples include venue-day-time sampling, where participants are selected from locations within time ranges when participants are often present (Mansergh, Naorat, Jommaroeng, Jenkins, Jeeyapant et al. 2006); the capture-recapture method derived from agriculture and wild life studies (Tilling 2001); and respondent-driving sampling (RDS), in which study participants are selected by working with a few seed persons to nominate others within their network connections (Heckathorn 1997, 2002). Although these methods allow for timely sampling of study participants, their validity in ensuring probability and representative samples is unclear.",

First, it is challenging to pre-determine the sample size for several reasons (Landry et al. 2005; Singh et al. 2012; Valliant, Dever, and Kreuter 2013b). The method consists of two steps: sample geographic areas, then sample participants in selected areas. Sample size is easy to determine if a study only needs to draw geographic samples (Balch, Drapeau, Bowler, Booth, Goes et al. 2004; Chen, Zhao, Gao, Henkelmann, and Schramm 2006; Conway 2006; Daly, Lei, Teixeira, Muir, Castillo et al. 2007; Huang, Zhao, Shi, Yu, Zhao et al. 2007; Valliant et al. 2013b: Pearson et al. 2015). However, it is not possible to know exactly how many persons are present in a randomly sampled geographic area before the area is selected (Landry et al. 2005; Shannon et al. 2012; Valliant et al. 2013b; Chen et al. 2015). One solution is to enumerate all households in a randomly sampled area after a geographic area is selected. This method has often proved infeasible (Landry et al. 2005; Escamilla et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2015) because of high and variable population density, complex residential structure, and presence of high-rise and multi-function buildings in selected geographic areas.",

Methods for distinguishing between the two have proven very time-consuming to implement (Chen et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2012; Escamilla et al. 2014; Kondo et al. 2014; Pearson et al. 2015). Recent methods haven been developed to recognize visually or digitally residential areas/housing with widely available aerial images (Chang et al. 2009; Wampler et al. 2013; Escamilla et al. 2014; Haenssgen 2015; Pearson et al. 2015). These methods are fast, inexpensive, and highly feasible. However, correctly recognizing residential houses remains a big problem even with the assistance of people from local communities. For example, Pearson et al. (2015) conducted a study to determine residential households using aerial images. With assistance of local experts after computerized sampling, five out of 175 determined residential household structures were verified in the field to be nonresidential. Although the error rate is not high, this study was conducted in a semi-nomadic pastoral area, a setting much simpler for random sampling than that of a modern urban area. More research is needed to improve this method for use in sampling complex residential areas (Escamilla et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2015; Haenssgen 2015).",

Galway and colleagues have used this approach in their studies and generated promising results (Galway et al. 2012). However, for stratification to be effective, detailed demographic data at the population level by individual grid cells across a jurisdiction are needed (Galway et al. 2012; Valliant et al. 2013b), and often such data are not available in resource-limited, low- and middle-income countries. Night-time satellite images provide information regarding population density, but this approach does not work for rural areas and resource-limited countries, and places with no electricity (Sutton 1998; Schneider, Friedl, and Potere 2009).",

Using a larger A increases the chance of sampling adequate numbers of households and eligible subjects, but also increases the workload for household enumeration. The appropriate size A can be determined through pilot studies, considering population density and the number of subjects to be recruited per geounit. For example, when conducting a survey targeting the rural-to-urban migrants temporarily living in Wuhan, China, A = 100m \u00d7100m was determined through intensive pilot tests in the field. This number was estimated by counting all households located in a geographic area with different sizes being measured manually using tape rulers and/or laser scales. This value of A has approximately 80% probability of covering an adequate number of households, ensuring at least 20 subjects per geounit in a city like Wuhan (Chen et al. 2015).",

Households were selected following their natural order on a street with the beginning of a main entrance street as the start point, and the first household was determined using random numbers. Of the migrant-occupied households, 1,251 were available and agreed to participate at the time of data collection. A total of 1,310 participants were recruited from these households with one participant per gender per household. The total number of households per geounit varied from thirty in least populated areas to 1,600 in the most populated areas with a median [quartile 1, quartile 3] of one hundred [50, 300] and mean (SD) = 200 (242). The number of households agreeing to participate per geounit varied from twelve to forty with median [quartile 1, quartile 3] of twenty [18, 24] and mean (SD) of twenty-one (6). Table 1 shows the detailed results from the sampling. Applying this method to another study conducted in 2012\u20132014, we estimated that approximately fifty-eight thousand [95% CI: 47,000, 68,000] rural-to-urban migrants in Wuhan were MSM with 3,650 [95% CI: 2,960, 4,282] being tested HIV positive (Chen et al. 2015). Official surveillance data from Wuhan indicated that a total of 3,408 (primarily MSM) persons were living with HIV in 2015 (Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) 2016). The observed result is within the estimated 95% CI, and the relatively small difference provides some evidence supporting the validity of our method.\n",

The fundamental mechanism of our method is to link geographic area with varying population density to households using numerous small geounits for further sampling. Therefore, one natural approach to deal with varying population density is application of the classic stratified sampling strategy to optimize geounit allocation (Cochran 1977), as have been commonly used in this and other studies (Galway et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2015). Our method also offers other possibilities to deal with varying population density issues. For example, instead of using a fixed geounit size and sampling grid, with our method researchers can determine the geounit size disproportionate to population density after randomly selecting the pre-determined number of geounits to be selected. Although determination of population density could remain be a challenge resource-limited areas, we may be able to deal with it with satellite imagery that is widely available.",

However, if a large-sized geounit is randomly selected in a highly populous area, it will prevent researchers from completing the sampling due to high costs of time and money (Landry et al. 2005). We recommend that researchers conduct adequate pilot studies to determine geounit size, considering variations in population density, time, and resources available for sampling.",

Although each selected geounit is not large in area size with a relatively fewer number of households, household arrangement can still be complex. In this study, we used the random route approach (Bauer 2016), by randomly selecting one household as starting point and then following natural order to select other households until the pre-determined number of households was reached. However, our method may lead to biased estimates of parameters that are related to physical distance. This can happen even with carefully planned and well-tested instructions (Bauer 2016). If conditions permit, an ideal approach would be to list all households in a sampled geounit first and then randomly select the pre-determined number of household for further sampling.",

A full assessment of the value of our approach requires its application to different populations in diverse geographic and residential settings. Like any multistage sampling method, it is a challenge to ensure an equal probability sample of households. The random route provides a good option, but attention must be paid to instructions to the data collectors and random selection of the starting household (Bauer 2016). Data on the size of a geographic unit is often not directly available, and can be obtained only through repeated pilot tests. Given large variations in household and population density in urban settings, large variations in estimated sample weights are anticipated. Such variations may reduce the precision of sample estimates.",
