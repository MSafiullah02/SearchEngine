The virus shares 79% genome sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic (2) . SARS-CoV can generate a rapid inflammatory cascade eventually leading to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, extensive disruption of epithelial cells and accumulation of reactive macrophages (3) . Similar to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV spike protein S binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is widely expressed on the cell membrane of oral, lung, and nasal mucosa epithelial cells, arterial smooth muscle and venous endothelial cells, as well of other organs, including stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain (4) . Supportive care-including prevention of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and secondary infections-remains the foundational approach for managing serious infections caused by coronaviruses, although preliminary analysis of a recently-reported, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, suggests that patients receiving remdesivir recovered faster than those receiving placebo (5) (6) (7) . Despite early optimism and approval on May 1 st , 2020 of remdesivir for emergency use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, no other specific antiviral treatment has been proven to be effective in randomized, placebo-controlled trials (5, 6) . Consequently, there remains a formidable unmet need to identify pharmacologic treatments, alone or in combination-directly targeting either viral mechanisms and/or host cell factors-that significantly inhibit viral replication and, by extension, minimize progression of target organ failure associated with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Current efforts focusing on antiviral drug discovery can be summarized as belonging to two broad strategies: (a) disrupting the synthesis and assembly of viral proteins or (b) targeting host proteins and mechanisms required by the viral replication cycle. The first strategy has yielded drugs targeting (i) viral proteases, required for processing of the virus large replicase polyprotein 1a, producing non-structural proteins involved in viral transcription and replication (5, 8) ; (ii) RNAdependent RNA-polymerase, using guanosine and adenosine analogs, as well as acyclovir derivatives; (iii) virus helicases; (iv) viral spike proteins, with antibodies, peptide decoys and carbohydrate-binding agents; and (v) structural proteins such as those maintaining ion channel activity of CoV E protein and RNA-binding affinity of CoV N protein (5, 6, 9, 10) . Although virus-targeting approaches have the advantage of being specific, and, therefore, generally offer acceptable toxicity profiles, targeting viral products typically restricts the applicability of antiviral agents to only one, or only a few, closely related virus species. Moreover, due to the high mutation rate of viral genomes, such drugs are prone to rapid virus adaptation by resistant strain selection (11, 12) . Considering the time required to develop new pharmacologic agents, this strategy has proven unsuitable to address new viral epidemics and pandemics in real time.",

            "text": "In contrast, targeting host cell proteins, especially at an early stage when viral hijacking of host mechanisms may still be reversible, may have more universal and longer term value because the same host factors may be required by multiple, potentially unrelated viral species and because host target proteins mutate far less rapidly than viral proteins, thereby limiting emergence of drug resistance (13) . Unfortunately, pharmacologic targeting of host factors is more commonly associated with toxicity, thereby limiting clinical application of many drugs identified as potential anti-viral agents in vitro, for instance, with anti-CoV drugs EC 50 markedly exceeding their maximum tolerated serum concentration (C max )(5). Despite these translational challenges, current approaches to target host proteins are primarily based on either boosting innate anti-viral immune response, in particular interferon response, or targeting proteins and processes mediating viral infection, such as ACE2 receptors (14) , cell surface and endosomal proteases (15) , and clathrin mediated endocytosis (16) . Moreover, broad availability of high-throughput screening approaches has allowed the purposing and repurposing of drugs based on their effect on virus replication (16) (17) (18) (19) , leading to identification of several anti-coronavirus candidates, such as chloroquine, tamoxifen, dasatinib and lopinavir, among others (16, 19 ). Yet, this approach is limited by the idiosyncratic nature of the in vitro models used in antiviral screens and by drug concentrations that may not be achievable in patients (5) .",

For simplicity, in a viral infection context, we will call such modules \"ViroCheckpoints.\" Accordingly, we propose that aberrant, virus-mediated activation of a ViroCheckpoint is ultimately responsible for creating a transcriptionally \"locked\" cellular context that is primed for viral replication and release. We thus propose ViroCheckpoint activity reversal as a potentially valuable therapeutic strategy for pharmacologic intervention.",

More importantly, once the MR protein identity is available, drugs can be effectively and reproducibly prioritized based on their ability to invert the activity of ViroCheckpoint MR proteins, using the OncoTreat algorithm(34), a NYS CLIA-certified algorithm that is used routinely on cancer patients at Columbia University.(38) Accurate identification of virus-dependent MR proteins permits deployment of the same OncoTreat-based methodological approach for mechanism-based repurposing or development of new drugs with potential anti-viral activity. To avoid confusion, we will use the term \"ViroTreat\" to indicate the virus-specific version of OncoTreat. Specifically, ViroTreat uses the full repertoire of virus-induced MR proteins in the ViroCheckpoint as a reporter assay to identify drugs capable of reversing its activity (34) , thereby preventing emergence of or abrogating the virus-mediated transcriptional locked state. While limited by the availability of data on SARS-CoV-2, including of infection in an appropriate pathophysiologic cell context, we provide proof of concept that this approach can be applied to prioritizing FDA-approved and late-stage investigational drugs representing potential antiviral agents for SARS-CoV based on infection in cancer-related lung epithelial cells.",

We have shown that VIPER can accurately measure the activity of >70% of regulatory proteins and, as a result, the algorithm has been used to elucidate MRs of both pathologic (31-33, 35, 36, 40, 41) and physiologic cell states (27) (28) (29) that have been experimentally validated. Moreover, VIPER-inferred protein activity has been shown to provide a better biomarker of cell phenotype than the original transcriptional profile (30, 34, 42, 43) ; and, importantly, is a better reporter for validating clinically relevant drug sensitivity (44) . Accordingly, VIPER requires a differential expression signature for each sample to be analyzed and a regulatory model comprising the transcriptional targets of each regulatory protein. For the former, we computed a differential gene expression signature for each SARS-CoV infected sample, by comparing it to three 12h mock control replicates. For the latter, we leveraged a transcriptional regulatory model (interactome) generated by ARACNe(45) analysis of 517 samples in the lung adenocarcinoma cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (37) . Use of a cancer-related interactome is well justified as we have shown that protein transcriptional targets are highly conserved between cancer and normal cells (28) .",

These showed significant activation as early as 12h after SARS-CoV infection. In contrast, established innate immune response proteins were also found among the top activated MRs, including IFN-induced factors(50) (MX1, IRF9 and IFI27) but their activation became most evident only at the latest time point (48h). Interestingly, some proteins previously identified as key tumor MRs were strongly activated, such as FOXM1 and CENPF (33, 51) , although this may be a byproduct of the cancer related nature of the Calu-3 cells used in the infection assays.",

Notably, it has been reported previously that coronaviruses inhibit the pRb tumor suppressor protein, inducing infected cell to progress rapidly from G 1 and to arrest the host cell in S phase (57) . SARS-CoV further favors host cell arrest in S phase by inhibiting CDK4 and CDK6 kinase activity (58) . We also observed activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway proteins, suggesting that SARS-CoV-similar to other viruses(59), including +ssRNA viruses like chikungunya(60), hepatitis C(61), west nile(62) and dengue (63) , as well as other RNA respiratory viruses like influenza(64) and the respiratory syncytial virus(65)-might subvert mTOR pathway activity. Indeed, temporal kinome analysis of human hepatocytes infected with MERS-CoV had previously revealed changes in MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (20) . Finally, we observed activation of proteins involved in innate immunity, including interferon response and pro-inflammatory pathways, which have been also previously described for coronaviruses (26) . While formal experimental validation is still required, there are several positive indications this approach may be effective. Specifically, drugs for SARS-CoV most highly prioritized by ViroTreat were highly consistent, at least based on their primary target proteins, with biological programs and pathways known to be modulated by coronavirus infection (26, 66) . Notably, in this regard, cell cycle progression/proliferation, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, innate immunity and inflammation are well represented among the primary target proteins for those pharmacologic agents strongly predicted by ViroTreat to possess host cell-targeted, antiviral effects.",

For instance, the MAPK inhibitor trametinib, one of the top ViroTreat hits for SARS-CoV, was shown to inhibit MERS-CoV replication in vitro (5, 20) , as well as influenza A virus both in vitro and in vivo (67) . Similarly, everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor identified by ViroTreat, has also been shown to inhibit MERS-CoV (5, 20) and cytomegalovirus (68) replication in vitro, as well as to reduce incidence of cytomegalovirus infections following kidney transplant (69) . Among tyrosine kinase inhibitors identified by ViroTreat, dasatinib was previously described to inhibit MERS-CoV(5, 19) and HIV-1 (70) replication in vitro; while erlotinib was shown to inhibit dengue(71), hepatitis C(72) and ebola (73) Finally, ViroTreat independently identified the SINE drug molecule selinexor-an FDA-approved agent for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma-as an extremely potent inverter of SARS-CoV-induced ViroCheckpoint activity. Selinexor is a potent and highly-specific inhibitor of XPO1 activity, which leads to nuclear retention of its cargo proteins containing leucine rich Nuclear Export Signals. Based on experimental studies performed by Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., low Selinexor concentrations (leq 100 nM) inhibited viral replication by 90% in green monkey kidney Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (80) .

Specifically, infection was conducted in a cancer cell line, rather than in a more physiologically relevant context, such as in primary bronchial or alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, drug perturbations were also performed in a cancer cell line context, thus potentially introducing undesired confounding factors, even though use of mock controls for the infection, and vehicle control for the drug perturbations, from the same cancer cell line should have eliminated most of the cancer-related bias and cell line idiosyncrasies. As a result, extrapolation of this approach to the clinic may be limited by the following assumptions: (a) that the host cell regulatory checkpoint hijacked by the virus is conserved between the Calu-3 adenocarcinoma cell line and the normal alveolar or bronchial epithelial cells in vivo; and (2) that the drugs' and compounds' MoA is conserved between the NCI-H1793 lung adenocarcinoma cells and normal lung epithelial cells in vivo. Moreover, while for the generation of the perturbational data and the contextspecific MoA database we used subtoxic drug concentrations that, in most cases, were well below the maximum tolerated dose for all drugs and compounds, the relevant pharmacologic concentration for their deployment as antiviral therapy may be much lower than the original recommended concentration for their use as anti-cancer drugs.",

Similarly, drug profiles should be generated in a more physiologic context, including primary airway epithelial cells.

In addition, ViroTreat represents a unique method for the systematic and quantitative prioritization of mechanism-based, host-directed drugs capable of abrogating this critical, and previously unaddressed component of viral infection. If effectively validated, this approach presents several advantages: First, Vi-roTreat is tailored to target the entire repertoire of host pro-teins hijacked by the virus to create a permissive environment, rather than a single host or viral protein. As such, we anticipate drugs identified by ViroTreat to have more universal applications, including being effective against a broader viral repertoire, while also being more effective at eluding virus adaptation mechanisms arising from rapid mutation under drug selection stress. Indeed, drug-mediated reprogramming of host cell to a transcriptional state that confers resistance against coronavirus-induced reprogramming presents the opportunity to identify drugs that are potentially effective for a broader class of viruses, as long as they share similar pathobiological strategies for host cell takeover. Second, the ViroTreat analysis can be performed expeditiously-as soon as the ViroCheckpoint signature of a novel virus becomes available. Therefore, this methodology is especially well-suited to the urgency characteristic of epidemics and pandemics.",

ED 20 was estimated by fitting a four-parameter sigmoid model to the titration results. NCI-H1793 cells, plated in 384-well plates, were then perturbed with a library of 328 FDA-approved drugs and small-molecule compounds at their corresponding ED 20 concentration.

ViroTreat requires two components: (A) a contextspecific drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) database, which is generated by perturbing an appropriate cell model with therapeutically relevant drug concentrations, followed by VIPER analysis of the drug-induced gene expression signatures and identification of the top most differentially active proteins, both activated and inactivated in response to the drug; and (B) the specific virus-induced protein activity signature-where the most differentially active proteins constitute the ViroCheckpoint-dissected by VIPER analysis of a gene expression signature, obtained by comparing an infected tissue or relevant model with non-infected mock controls. ViroTreat then predicts the effect of the drugs on the ViroCheckpoint by matching their MoA with the virus-induced protein activity signature, and quantifies the inverse enrichment using the aREA algorithm. The diagram shows 3 drugs, where only drug B, by activating the host proteins that are being inactivated during virus infection, and inactivating the proteins that are being activated by the virus infection, effectively acts by inverting the ViroCheckpoint activity pattern; and, therefore, would be prioritized as a host cell-targeted antiviral therapeutic option.",
