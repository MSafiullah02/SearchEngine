Noted to have a high mortality rate, early diagnosis and intervention with both antibiotics and surgery are crucial in treating P. aeruginosa IE [[1], [2], [3]]. Although there is a rise in infection in patients with prosthetic heart valves or with implanted cardiac devices such as pacemakers or defibrillators, many of the reported cases in literature of P. aeruginosa IE involve right sided disease in intravenous drug users (IVDU) [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Here, we present the rare case of native-valve left-sided P. aeruginosa endocarditis in a patient with no history of IVDU.",

Both sets of blood cultures obtained on arrival to the emergency department at the OSH were negative for growth.

He was started on cefepime and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) obtained on admission was negative for any valvular abnormalities, including vegetation. However, despite treatment with cefepime, the patient\u2019s blood cultures continued to be positive for P. aeruginosa that had no significant associated resistance. One week into hospitalization, a CT chest with contrast was obtained and revealed a paratracheal mass, possibly suggestive of lymphadenopathy. On day 10 at the OSH, a TEE revealed a large vegetation involving the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve with severe aortic insufficiency; it was noted that an abscess was unable to be ruled out. Based on the persistent bacteremia and TEE findings, a diagnosis of infective endocarditis was reached. Tobramycin was added to the cefepime on day 10 to provide a synergistic antipseudomonal effect and the patient was then transferred to our facility for CTS evaluation.",

The patient had no apparent neurological deficits; however, was transferred to the Neuro-Intensive care unit for closer monitoring for approximately 24 hours. Additionally, due to the risk of hemorrhage from the heparin bolus needed during valve replacement, CTS felt it was appropriate to defer valve replacement surgery and upon their own review of the TEE, did not see an abscess.

The plan was to have him follow up 4 weeks later and re-draw blood cultures and discontinue antibiotics upon the first negative culture results and to repeat blood cultures again 2 weeks after that. This plan was discussed in detail with the patient. However, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the follow up appointment has been deferred indefinitely.

Although in the past P. aeruginosa IE has been associated with intravenous drug users, recently, a shift towards nosocomial, or healthcare associated P. aeruginosa, is being observed [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. A large cohort study done by Morpeth et al. found that of non-HACEK gram negative IE (species other than Haemophilus species, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella species), only 4% of the cases were associated to active IVDU [6]. Additionally, a recent Italian cohort study found that the genitourinary tract was the most frequent source of infection in IE due to gram negative bacteremia (GNB) [7]. In the case of this patient, who was found to have right sided nephrolithiasis requiring PCNL as well as a P. aeruginosa cystitis upon initial presentation to the OSH months prior, it may be argued that the PCNL, the indwelling urinary bladder catheter placed during that admission, and/or the intermittent urethral self-catheterization the patient resumed at discharge, may have introduced bacteria into the bloodstream, possibly in the case of the latter two by damaging the urethral mucosa. No blood cultures, other than the two obtained in the emergency room on arrival that admission, were obtained until the patient presented back to the OSH 2 months later and was found to be bacteremic.",

Antibiotic therapy for P. aeruginosa IE consists of six weeks of two intravenous antipseudomonal agents, each from a different antimicrobial class to which that strain is susceptible to [2]. This combination draws on the concept of antimicrobial synergy, which allows for two different mechanisms of bacterial killing. In gram-negative infections, synergy has been traditionally seen with beta-lactam and aminoglycoside combinations; the beta-lactam mediated disturbance of the cell walls of gram negative bacteria allows aminoglycosides to pass into the periplasmic space [10]. Recently however, similar data has been emerging with beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone combinations [10].",

Additionally, due to a higher MIC for cefepime that resulted on day 10 for cultures that were obtained on day 7, (MIC of 8 compared to that of 2 from blood cultures obtained on arrival) the cefepime was switched to an extended infusion rate, 2 g every 8 hours administered over 3 hours, instead of over 3-5 minutes. This change is based on the pharmacodynamics principle that beta lactam antibiotics have a time dependent effect on bacterial eradication [11,12]. Therefore, increasing the duration of exposure of the antibiotic to the bacteria by extending the infusion rate may be more effective at bacteria eradication especially at higher MICs [11,12].",

In the case of our patient surgery was delayed at the time due to a guarded clinical and functional status as well as the presence of hemorrhagic foci in the parietal lobes as evident on imaging. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished the patient\u2019s ability to adhere to follow up measures or consult with CTS. In the meantime, the patient has been advised to continue with the regimen of ciprofloxacin 750 mg BID P.O. and extended infusion cefepime. We have good reason to remain hopeful that updated blood cultures will be negative when the patient is in fact able to follow up.",
