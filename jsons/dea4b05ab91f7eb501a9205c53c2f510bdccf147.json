Because of its recent emergence, there is a paucity of information regarding viral behavior and host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we offer an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other respiratory viruses. Cell and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, consistently revealed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response. This response is defined by low levels of type I and III interferons juxtaposed to elevated chemokines and high expression of IL-6. We propose that reduced innate antiviral defenses coupled with exuberant inflammatory cytokine production are the defining and driving features of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The physiological response to virus infection is generally initiated at the cellular level following replication (tenOever, 2016) . After virus entry, the infected cell detects the presence of virus replication through any one of a number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002) . These receptors serve as sentinels for a variety of microbes inside and outside of the cell by physically engaging distinct structures that are shared among different pathogens. In the case of virus infection, cellular detection of replication is largely mediated by a family of intracellular PRRs that sense aberrant RNA structures that often form during virus replication (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002) . Engagement of virus-specific RNA structures culminates in oligomerization of these receptors and activation of downstream transcription factors, most notably interferon regulator factors (IRFs) and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) (Hur, 2019) . Transcriptional activation of IRFs and NF-kB results in the launch of two general antiviral programs. The first is engagement of cellular antiviral defenses, which is mediated by transcriptional induction of type I and III interferons (IFN-I and IFN-III, respectively) and subsequent upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Lazear et al., 2019) . The second arm of the antiviral response involves recruitment and coordination of specific subsets of leukocytes, which is orchestrated primarily by chemokine secretion (Proudfoot, 2002; Sokol and Luster, 2015) .",

Therefore, the host response to a virus is generally not uniform, and infections can inflict different degrees of morbidity and mortality. The current pandemic of COVID-19 is an acute and rapidly developing global health crisis. To better understand the molecular basis of the disease, we sought to characterize the transcriptional response to infection in a variety of model systems, including in vitro tissue culture, ex vivo infection of primary cells, and in vivo samples derived from COVID-19 patients and animals. We chose to characterize the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and determine how it compares with common respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). These two respiratory viruses encode a variety of different antagonists to the IFN-I and -III response (Frieman and Baric, 2008; Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2017) . For the closely related SARS-CoV-1, IFN antagonism has been attributed to ORF3B, ORF6, and the nucleocapsid (N) gene products (Frieman et al., 2010; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) . SARS-CoV-1 also encodes nsp1, a nuclease that has been implicated in cleaving host mRNA to prevent ribosomal loading and causing host shutoff (Kamitani et al., 2006) . Similar to SARS-CoV-1, IAV also encodes the IFN-I and -III antagonist nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), which blocks initial detection by the PRR through binding and masking aberrant RNA produced during infection .",

            "text": "Defining the Transcriptional Response to SARS-CoV-2 Relative to Other Respiratory Viruses To compare the transcriptional response of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and IAV, we first chose to focus on infection in a variety of respiratory cell lines (Figure 1 ). To this end, we collected poly(A) RNA from infected cells and performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to estimate viral load. These data show that virus infection levels ranged from 0.1% to more than 50% of total RNA reads ( Figure 1A ). In agreement with others (Harcourt et al., 2020) , we found A549 lung alveolar cells to be relatively non-permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication, in contrast to Calu-3 cells (0.1% versus 15% total reads, respectively). The low rate of infection in A549 cells is postulated to be the result of low expression of the viral receptor ACE2 (Harcourt et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020) . To bypass this restriction, we supplemented A549 cells with a vector expressing mCherry or ACE2 ( Figures 1B-1D) . In low-MOI infections (MOI, 0.2), exogenous expression of ACE2 enabled SARS-CoV-2 to replicate and comprise $54% of the total reads mapping more than 3003 coverage across the $30-kb genome ( Figures 1A and 1B) . Western blot analyses corroborated these RNA-seq data, showing Nucleocapsid (N) expression only in cells supplemented with ACE2 ( Figure 1C ). Furthermore, qPCR analyses of these cells demonstrated that the levels of Envelope (E) and non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) were more than three orders of magnitude higher in the presence of ACE2 ( Figure 1D ). It is noteworthy that, despite this dramatic increase in viral load, we observed neither activation of TBK1, the kinase responsible for IFN-I and IFN-III expression, nor induction of STAT1 and MX1, IFN-I-stimulated genes ( Figure S1A ; Sharma et al., 2003) . The lack of IFN-I and -III engagement in ACE2-expressing A549 cells could, however, be overcome by using a 10-fold increase in virus (MOI, 2) despite the fact that total viral reads after 24 h of replication where comparable with low-MOI conditions ( Figures 1A, 1B , and 1F).",

We also observed no increase in viral Spike levels (or a considerable effect on viral reads) when IFN-I signaling was blocked by addition of ruxolitinib, a JAK1 and 2 kinase inhibitor, despite significantly preventing induction of ISGs (Figures S1D-S1H).

These analyses indicate that the transcriptional response in cells that allows high replication of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly different from the host response of all other viruses tested ( Figure 1E ). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection in unmodified A549 cells shows a unique response compared with SARS-CoV-1 despite comparable levels of viral load ( Figures 1A and 1E) . Last, MERS-CoV infection, which approaches $50% of total reads at 24 hours post-infection (hpi), clusters together with SARS-CoV-1 and IAV, reflecting an overall repression of the host antiviral response ( Figures 1E and 1F ). Conversely, HPIV3 and RSV comprise a unique cluster denoted by high expression of IFNs and ISGs ( Figures 1E and 1F ). Interestingly, low-MOI SARS-CoV-2-infected A549 cells expressing ACE2 (A549-ACE2) show no significant IFN-I or IFN-III expression but instead display moderate levels of a subset of ISGs and a unique proinflammatory cytokine signature ( Figure 1F ). This signature is also present in high-MOI infections of SARS-CoV-2 in A549-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells, together with more than 6,000 other differentially expressed genes, further explaining Table S1 ). Furthermore, high-MOI infection in these cells also led to high induction of IFNs and ISGs observed for HPIV3 and RSV, despite remarkable differences in viral replication ($60% total reads in A549-ACE2 cells compared with $15% in Calu-3 cells) (Figures 1A and 1F ). The discrepancy between the levels of viral replication and IFN production/signaling suggests that, although SARS-CoV-2 is capable of engaging the IFN-I and IFN-III systems, this response is prevented by an antagonist that is rendered ineffective under high-MOI conditions. Alternatively, these data may instead indicate that high-MOI conditions in cell culture result in formation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which may or may not reflect physiological conditions in vivo.",

Treatment of NHBE cells with IFN-I resulted in significant induction of 381 genes, most of these also differentially expressed in IAVDNS1 infection, together outlining a robust innate immune response in these cells (Figure 2A ). In contrast, and despite different levels of replication, the transcriptional response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and WT IAV are similar in magnitude but different in nature, with only 8 shared significantly induced genes, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IRF9, ICAM1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Figure 2A ; Figure S2A ). To further understand the global host response as it pertained to each of these conditions, we grouped these samples in a PCA space ( Figure 2B ). This analysis shows progressive transcriptional perturbations along principal component one, which accounts for more than 60% of sample variation. In this space, SARS-CoV-2 elicits the most modest transcriptional changes, followed by IAV, IFNb treatment, and IAVDNS1 ( Figure 2B ).",

To this end, we chose to perform SARS-CoV-2 infections in ferrets because this has been described as an appropriate animal model (Kim et al., 2020) . Ferrets were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A/California/04/2009 and monitored by nasal wash, which generates a small pellet of cells from the upper respiratory tract. RNA-seq was performed on these cells, enabling us to quantify viral load over time. Reads from nasal wash 1 day after infection revealed a low level of virus replication comprising 0.006% of total reads ( Figure 3A ). Three days after infection, virus replication peaked at 1.2% of the total sequencing reads before decreasing to 0.05% of total reads on day 7 and completely clearing the virus by day 14 ( Figure 3A ). As a comparison, a sublethal infection of IAV comprised less than 0.03% of total reads on day 7 from the same sample type ( Figure S3A ). The presence of virus in the nasal passage would further suggest that these ferrets had the potential to transmit the virus, in agreement with the findings of others (Kim et al., 2020; Varble et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "To characterize the response to SARS-CoV-2 over time, upper respiratory cell populations were compared with mock-treated ferrets. On day 1 after infection, we observed very little transcriptional difference correlating to the amount of virus detection at this time ( Figure 3B ). By day 3, we observed the beginning of a cytokine response marked by CCL8 and CXCL9, consistent with what was observed in cell culture. By day 7, despite waning levels of virus, the cytokine response continued to expand and included CCL2, CCL8, and CXCL9, among others ( Figure 3B ; Table S3 ). Moreover, we noted evidence of mixed leukocyte infiltration with significant upregulation in CD163, CD226, CCR5, CCR6, CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR7 ( Figure 3C ). Overall, the magnitude of this transcriptional response in the upper respiratory tract was significantly lower compared with a comparable IAV infection ( Figure S3B ). However, although IAV induces a greater number of genes, SARS-CoV-2 generates a unique gene signature enriched for cell death and leukocyte activation, including transcripts such as IL1A and CXCL8 (GO: 0008219 and GO: 0045431; Table S3 ). In contrast, the transcriptional footprint of IAV as it pertains to the cellular antiviral response was strikingly greater in magnitude than that observed for SARS-CoV-2 and included the IFN signature genes MX1, ISG20, OASL, and Tetherin ( Figure S3B ; Table S3 ). By day 14, we detected no viral reads for SARS-CoV-2, and the observed cytokines returned to baseline, with the exception of IL-6 and IL1RN or IL1RA, which remained elevated, similar to results observed with MERS (Pascal et al., 2015; Figures 3B and 3C) . (E) Heatmap as in (D) for genes belonging to GO annotations for cytokine activity and chemokine activity (GO: 0005125, GO: 0008009). The graphs depict the log 2 (fold change) of DEGs of infected compared with mock-treated cells. Genes included have a log 2 (fold change) of more than 1 and a p-adjusted value of less than 0.05. Last, to investigate how the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and IAV affected the respiratory tract, we next performed parallel infections and examined the trachea on day 3. With both infections, we observed very low levels of virus but a robust transcriptional response (Table S3) . Gene enrichment analysis of differentially expressed transcripts implicated two populations of immune cell signatures ( Figure 3D ). The first population included common markers for monocytes and lymphocytes, and the induction of these genes was comparable between SARS-CoV-2 and IAV ( Figures 3D and S3C) . Intriguingly, unique gene signatures from SARS-CoV-2-infected trachea that were largely absent in response to IAV align with those of progenitor cells from the hematopoietic lineage, suggesting that infection may be inducing hematopoiesis ( Figures 3D and S3C ) (Lefran\u00e7 ais et al., 2017; Yoshida et al., 2019) . Additional research in this area will be required to ascertain whether this is a contributing factor toward the development of COVID-19.",

To this end, we first compared post-mortem lung samples from COVID-19-positive patients with biopsied healthy lung tissue from uninfected individuals. Transcriptional profiling of these samples, all derived from males older than 60 years (n = 2 for each group), demonstrated $2,000 differen-tially expressed genes with enrichment for the innate and humoral responses (Figures 4A and S4A ). Genes significantly induced in response to SARS-CoV-2 included a subset of ISGs with no IFN-I or IFN-III detected by RNA-seq or semiquantitative PCR ( Figure S4B ; Table S4 ). In addition to genes implicated in innate antiviral immunity, SARS-CoV-2 also induced robust levels of chemokines, including CCL2, CCL8, and CCL11 ( Figure 4A ). Despite the limited number of patients analyzed, these data corroborate our findings in NHBE and ferrets ( Figure S4A ). Next we wished to further validate our findings with a larger cohort of patients through direct detection of circulating cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, we obtained serum from two cohorts of individuals from the Kaiser Santa Clara testing facility (Santa Clara, CA). These two cohorts tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swabs or were admitted to the hospital for non-COVID-19-related respiratory issues (n = 24 for each group). During initial analyses, these serum samples consistently tested negative for IFNb and the IFNl family of IFNs ( Figure 4B ). Moreover, analyses of cytokines and chemokines quantified in individual serum samples revealed enhancement of generalized inflammation among COVID-19 patients, marked by a significant increase in circulating IL-6, IL1RA, CCL2, CCL8 CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL16 levels (Figure 4C ). Significant elevation of CXCL9 and CXCL16 (chemoattractants of T or natural killer (NK) cells, respectively), CCL8 and CCL2 (which recruit monocytes and/or macrophages), and CXCL8 (a classic neutrophil chemoattractant) suggest that the presence of these cells may be a primary driver of the signature pathology observed in COVID-19 patients (Proudfoot, 2002) . Although this sample size is not necessarily representative of the whole population of infected COVID-19 patients, our data are consistent with what we observe using our other model systems. Additional sampling will be required to validate these findings.",

In general, our data show that the overall transcriptional footprint of SARS-CoV-2 infection was distinct in comparison with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses and common respiratory viruses such as IAV, HPIV3, and RSV. It is noteworthy that, despite a reduced IFN-I and -III response to SARS-CoV-2, we observed a consistent chemokine signature. One exception to this observation is the response to high-MOI infection in A549-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells, where replication was robust and an IFN-I and -III signature could be observed. In both of these examples, cells were infected at a rate to theoretically deliver two functional virions per cell in addition to any defective interfering particles within the virus stock that were not accounted for by plaque assays. Under these conditions, the threshold for PAMP may be achieved prior to the ability of the virus to evade detection through production of a viral antagonist. Alternatively, addition of multiple genomes to a single cell may disrupt the stoichiometry of viral components, which, in turn, may itself generate A C B",

These ideas are supported by the fact that, at a low-MOI infection in A549-ACE2 cells, high levels of replication could also be achieved, but in the absence of IFN-I and -III induction. Taken together, these data suggest that, at low MOIs, the virus is not a strong inducer of the IFN-I and -III system, as opposed to conditions where the MOI is high. These dynamics are also likely to contribute to development of COVID-19 during the course of infection (Wolfel et al., 2020) .",

According to our longitudinal in vivo data, this response starts as early as 3 days after infection and continues beyond clearance of the virus. A recent study analyzing severe versus mild cases of COVID-19 showed that peripherally derived macrophages predominated in the lungs of severe cases (Liao et al., 2020) . Consistent with this, we found, in all of our systems, significant induction of monocyte-associated chemokines such as CCL2 and CCL8. In addition, our data suggest that neutrophils could also contribute to the disease observed in COVID-19 patients, as demonstrated by CXCL2 and CXCL8 induction. This is consistent with data showing elevated circulating neutrophil levels among COVID-19 patients Qin et al., 2020) , which may have prognostic value for identifying individuals at risk for developing severe disease. It is also noteworthy that two of the cytokines uniquely elevated in response to SARS-CoV-2 are IL-6 and IL1RA, suggesting that there might be a parallel between COVID-19 and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a complication commonly seen following CAR T-cell treatment (Giavridis et al., 2018) . Should this be true, drugs such as tocilizumab and anakinra may prove to be beneficial for treatment of COVID-19 (Norelli et al., 2018) . Future studies will be needed to address this formally.",

Based on animal models, SARS-CoV-1 has been found to induce a robust cytokine response that generally shows a delay in IFN-I, culminating in improper recruitment of inflammatory monocytemacrophage populations (Channappanavar et al., 2016) . This dynamic seems to be in line with what we observed with SARS-CoV-2 because low levels of IFN-I and -III are likely produced in response to infection. Given the moderate viral replication levels observed in vivo, one explanation for the low IFN expression could be that a small subset of cells is refractory to the antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, producing sufficient amounts of IFN-I and/or IFN-III to guide immune cell activation and ISG induction.",

The physiological basis for this morbidity is believed to be selective death of type II pneumocytes, which results in loss of air exchange and fluid leakage into the lungs (Qian et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2020) . Although it remains to be determined whether the inappropriate inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the abnormally high lethality in older populations, it does explain why the virus is generally asymptomatic in young people with healthy and robust immune systems . Given the results here, it is tempting to speculate that an already restricted immune response in the aging population prevents successful inhibition of viral spread at early stages of infection, further exacerbating the morbidity and mortality observed for this age group (Jing et al., 2009; Montecino-Rodriguez et al., 2013) .",

All work involving live SARS-CoV-2 was performed in the CDC/USDA-approved BSL-3 facility of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in accordance with institutional biosafety requirements. METHOD DETAILS RNA-Seq of viral infections Approximately 5 3 10 5 A549 or Calu-3 cells were infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus (IAV), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) or SARS-CoV-2 as indicated. Infections with IAV were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 9 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine and 1 mg/ml TPCKtrypsin. Infections with RSV and HPIV3 were performed at an MOI of 2 for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose and 4 mM L-glutamine. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 were performed at an MOI of 0.2 or 2 for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES. Approximately 5 3 10 5 NHBE cells were infected with either SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 2 for 24 h or influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus or influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus lacking the NS1 gene at an MOI of 3 for 12 h in bronchial epithelial growth media supplemented with BEGM SingleQuots. As a comparison to viral infection, NHBE cells were treated with 100 units / mL of IFNb for 4 -12 h. Total RNA from infected and mock infected cells was lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and extracted and DNase I treated using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA-seq libraries of polyadenylated RNA were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) or TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Adenovector transductions Approximately 5 3 10 5 A549 cells were transduced with Adenovectors purchased from Vector Biolabs at an MOI of 500 to induce expression of mCherry (Ad-mCherry) and human ACE2 (Ad-GFP-h-ACE2). 48 h post-transduction, efficient gene expression of delivered fluorescent proteins was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy using an EVOS M5000 Imaging System. Drug treatments Approximately 5 3 10 5 Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.05 in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES. Vero E6 cells were treated with 100 units of universal Type-I IFNB 2 h post-infection. NHBE cells were treated with 100 units of human IFNb as indicated. Cells were harvested for RNA and protein analysis 24 hpi as described below. Approximately 2.5 3 10 5 A549 cells transduced with an ACE2 Adenovector were pre-treated with 500 nM Ruxolitinib or DMSO control for 1 h in infection media before infection with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 2 for 24 h. Cells were harvested for protein analysis as described below. Western blot Protein was extracted from cells in Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer containing 1X cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and 1X Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma Aldrich) prior to safe removal from the BSL-3 facility. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were detected using mouse monoclonal anti-Actin",

RNA-seq was performed on poly(A)-enriched total RNA, and the percentage of virus-aligned reads (over total reads) is indicated for each sample. Error bars represent standard deviation from three independent biological replicates (except for IAV infection, where data are representative of independent biological duplicates). The cell types used for each infection is indicated (+) at the bottom of the figure. All infections were performed at a high MOI (MOI, 2-5), except for *, which indicates an MOI of 0.2. (B) Read coverage along the SARS-CoV-2 genome for mCherry-or ACE2-expressing A549 cells. The graph indicates the number of viral reads per position of the virus genome in A549 cells transduced with adenovirus (AdV)-based vectors expressing mCherry (MOI, 0.2; light blue) or ACE2 (MOI 0.2, salmon (*); MOI 2, dark red). A scaled model of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and its genes is depicted below (generated in BioRender). (C) Western blot analysis of mCherry-or ACE2-expressing A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Whole-cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted for ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), and actin. (D) qRT-PCR analysis of mCherry-or ACE2-expressing A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI, 0.2). The graph depicts the relative amount of SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E), non-structural protein 14 (nsp14), and human IFNB transcripts normalized to human a-tubulin. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean log 2 (fold change) of three independent biological replicates.(E) Principal-component analysis (PCA) for the global transcriptional response to respiratory viruses. Sparse PCA depicts global transcriptome profiles of the samples in (A). Cell types used for infection are represented by different shapes (circle, A549; square, A549-ACE; diamond, Calu-3; triangle, MRC5).
