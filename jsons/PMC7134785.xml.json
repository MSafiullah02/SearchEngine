            "text": "Food safety has ameliorated over the years due to the application of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) systems and the development of risk assessments (RA). HACCP is a systematic approach to the identification, evaluation and control of those steps in food manufacturing that are critical to product safety. The basic objective of the HACCP concept is assuring the production of safe food products by prevention instead of quality inspection (Luning, Marcelis, & Jongen, 2002). HACCP is a system applied to identify known food safety hazards, and is currently applied per stage in the production supply chain instead of the total production chain. Food safety RA comprises the scientific evaluation of known or potential adverse health effects resulting from human exposure to specific food borne hazards (Codex, 1999). It typically uses data on the particular hazard and production chain under consideration, and modelling to estimate the final likelihood of harm due to human exposure. Both HACCP and RA focus on known hazards and make use of historical data related to the particular hazard(s) as well as to the particular chain of interest. Risk managers and assessors need to get access to all available data on food safety hazards as soon as possible. For this purpose, there are various warning systems for notification on the likelihood of a hazard. Examples are the EU Rapid Alert System on Food and Feed (RASFF, http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/rapidalert/index_en.htm), the WHO-Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/en/) and the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) in Canada (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/media/nr-rp/2004/2004_gphin-rmispbk_e.html) (Marvin et al., 2009). Such warning systems address known, well-characterized food and feed safety hazards (Marvin et al., 2009, VWA, 2006).",

            "text": "In order to identify and prevent emerging hazards leading to food safety risks, it is necessary to move towards a more pro-active system for identification of emerging food and feed related risks (Marvin et al., 2009). An emerging risk (ER) is defined as a risk resulting from a newly identified hazard to which a significant exposure may occur, or from an unexpected new or increased significant exposure and/or susceptibility to a known hazard (EFSA, 2007). ER may be directly linked to the food production chain or indirectly connected to it (Marvin et al., 2009). Therefore, in order to identify emerging risks in an early stage, an holistic approach is proposed (VWA, 2005). This approach implies that emergence of a risk can be the result from factors inside the production chain (endogenous) or outside the chain (exogenous). In addition, emergence of hazards related to risks is usually a result of a particular change inside or outside the production chain. A pro-active system for the identification of emerging food safety risks should, therefore, preferable be based on (endogenous and exogenous) factors characterizing the dynamics of a food production system. Endogenous factors (associated with changes within the production chain) may be related to technological innovations, their implementation driven from production perspectives. Exogenous factors (associated with changes outside the production chain) may include for example economic changes, climate change, international trade and changes in human behaviour. These exogenous factors are related to influential sectors as described in the EMRISK and PERI-APT project (VWA, 2005, VWA, 2006).",

An example of a critical factor is climate change with temperature and rainfall as indicators (Van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2008, VWA, 2005). These indicators form the key elements of an ER identification system. For these key indicators, information sources (data and expertise) and critical limits should be determined. When the limit of one or more indicators is exceeded, required actions can be taken in an early stage to prevent food safety problems occurring as a result of substantial changes in novel and/or dynamic production chains (VWA, 2006).",

In these studies, a retrospective approach has been applied in which cases from the past were analysed in order to select the most important critical factors. Examples of cases studied are Avian Influenza (AI), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), acrylamide, trans fatty acids, dioxins and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) (Hagenaars et al., 2006, VWA, 2005, VWA, 2006). Although these studies elaborated on critical factors, they are restricted since they are event and/or hazard driven and, consequently, the results may be case-sensitive. As such, it is unclear whether these findings are also applicable to identify emerging food safety risks in dynamic production chains. The aim of this research is to explore the feasibility of a systematic approach to identify the most important critical factors related to changes in production chains that may lead to food safety problems.",

Factors were divided into endogenous, exogenous and consumer related factors. The latter are also exogenous factors; however, they have a more short-term effect in comparison with exogenous factors such as climate change. For example, increased individualization in society (a lifestyle change) gives a higher demand for smaller consumption portions and ready-to-eat foods. This has a short-term effect on the production of novel products that can fulfil this demand. Therefore, consumer related factors are treated separately in this paper.",

The more complex the system is, the higher the possibility of errors resulting in food safety risks. Factors 7\u201310 (firm size, information exchange, contractual agreements and integration and cooperation) are linked to the producers\u2019 attitude towards food safety (Deneux, Van der Fels-Klerx, Tromp, & De Vlieger, 2005). It is assumed that larger firms (factor 7) are more up-to-date with food safety requirements, which thus reduces food safety risks (Holt & Henson, 2000). Furthermore, network embeddedness (characterized by factors 8\u201310) influence the food safety status of a company (Deneux et al., 2005). The effect of companies on food safety risk is further characterized in producers\u2019 compliance to food safety regulations (factors 11\u201313). This compliance can be quantified using the \u2018Table of Eleven\u2019, developed by the Dutch Ministry of Justice (2006). The approach comprises 11 dimensions, which together decide the extent to which legislation is complied with. For food safety issues and ease of elicitation these dimensions were aggregated into three factors that were judged to be critical: food safety awareness, probability of detection and severity of sanctions (factors 11\u201313). More technical factors related to innovation in the food chain are indicated in factors 14\u201318 and are linked to the influential sector \u2018science and technology\u2019.",

The experts were selected in such a way that knowledge and expertise from each case was represented as well as general food safety expertise. Half of the invited experts attended the workshop; including seven risk managers, five experts from the food industry, one from a socio-professional organization and five from research institutes. The workshop consisted of two rounds. In the first round, participants were divided into three subgroups and each subgroup was asked to evaluate one case. Experts were divided over the subgroups such that their expertise matched the case. The dairy case consisted of representatives of research institutes, dairy (regulatory) industrial organizations, food safety authorities and the Dutch ministry of health, welfare and sports. The fruit case consisted of representatives of research institutes, food safety authorities, the horticulture product board, a socio-professional organization and the ministry of agriculture, nature and food quality (department of trade and industry). The potato case consisted of representatives of research institutes, food safety authorities and the agricultural product board. The experts were asked to score a change (over the period of 2000\u20132006) in the listed critical factors from \u22122 (much less change) to +2 (much more change). For each change in critical factors, its subsequent consequences on food safety risks were scored from \u22122 (much less risk) to +2 (much more risk). The findings of the in-depth interviews were depicted on a scoring-card. The scores were orally clarified using the arguments of the interviewees. This offered a basis for discussion and the experts proceeded by taking up the scoring tasks themselves. By no means was a consensus strived for, the approach merely facilitated the clarification of definitions used and relevant arguments. After the most important factors were extracted from the three cases, the subgroups gathered for a plenary session. The aim of this second round of the workshop was to determine whether the obtained critical factors per case could be used in general for stimuli originating either from inside the production chain (dairy case), outside the production chain (fruit case) or driven by the consumer (potato case). This was done by comparing the various cases with other products or processes originating from an endogenous, exogenous or consumer stimulus. For the dairy case, which had an endogenous stimulus, examples used for the discussion were products produced under Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) or Pulsed Electric Field (PEF). Another example comparable to the fruit case, which had an exogenous stimulus, is the increased import of exotic products like couscous or kumquat. An increasing amount of convenience products and functional foods were additional examples that were compared with the potato case that originated from a consumer stimulus.",

Since the exact origin of raw materials for Valess was unknown to the experts, the participants found it difficult to rate its food safety risk (bandwidth was collectively set at 0 up to +2). The other factors all relate to an increased product and chain complexity of Valess compared to pasteurized milk, since it contains more raw materials and has more process steps than pasteurized milk, which may result in increased food safety risks.",

Other factors that were rated differently included the consumer factors \u2018animal welfare\u2019 (factor 26) and \u2018convenience\u2019 (factor 28). Although these factors can indicate a change in the production process, they were judged as not important for food safety in this case and thus will not be elaborated upon. An increase in convenience can lead to more ready-to-eat refrigerated products, but in this case both products (milk and Valess) are refrigerated, so there is no difference in food safety risk. Within the group there was also variability in answers. One factor with large variation was \u2018legal requirements\u2019 (factor 20). In January 2007, the General Food Law has been implemented (EC, 2002). Some experts thought this implementation comprised a large change in the production chain compared to the previous system, whereas others thought the new regulations were comparable. The same accounts for the effect of these new EU regulations on food safety. Some experts judged that the General Food Law can be interpreted more freely offering possibilities for less high food safety standards.

The workshop scores for \u2018origin of raw materials\u2019 (factor 19) illustrate well the situation for mangoes: compared to the Dutch apple there is a considerable shift in country of origin (+2) which, for mango, varies according to the season from e.g. Australia to India. As a result, workshop scores for the related food safety risk range from 0 to +2, since food safety risks are perceived rather differently for these countries. For example, small-scale producers in India have a higher perceived food safety risk than industrial plantations in Australia. For the same reason, almost identical ranges in food safety scores can be found for firm size (factor 7), integration and cooperation (factor 10), producers\u2019 food safety awareness (factor 11), and probability of detection (factor 12). The rather extreme scores (\u22122 and +2) for \u2018legal requirements\u2019 (factor 20) when comparing mango to apple are due to two reasons. Firstly, in general, there are much less strict safety requirements in (some) countries of origin (\u22122), thereby potentially leading to an increased food safety risk for the Dutch market (+2). Secondly, for most exotic fruits legal agreements on authorised plant protection products are much less stable (\u22122), thereby inducing the regular introduction of unauthorised plant protection products (+2). The 0\u20130 scores for legal requirements relate to the Dutch market as they are in the end identical for all products sold in the Netherlands.",

Since the stew contains more ingredients than traditional potatoes, more chain partners are involved indicating an increased chain complexity, which (as in the dairy case) may result in increased food safety risks. Apart from increased chain complexity, the production process is also more complex in comparison with table potato, since it comprises more process steps. As stew should be kept frozen, which has its implications for transport and logistics, this may have its impact on food safety according to the expert group. It is essential to keep the ingredients frozen during transport, therefore, truck drivers should understand this importance and act accordingly.

On the other hand, workshop participants expected considerable improvements in factors related to producers\u2019 behaviour (factors 11\u201313).

In general, for both the dairy and the potato case endogenous factors clustered in \u2018product complexity\u2019 were evaluated as important. In these cases, the novel products originated from the same production chain as the traditional product, the stimulus being either consumer or producer driven.

For all three cases, factors related to human behaviour played an important role: in the fruit case this included compliance with contractual agreements; in the dairy case, producers\u2019 food safety awareness was judged important; and in the potato case, knowledge of the importance of cooling (human factor) was the most important factor influencing food safety. The importance of factors related to human behaviour was also recognized in the PERI-APT and EMRISK project.

In our approach, we aimed to extract a list of critical factors from these and other literature studies that are of general importance to food safety thereby using endogenous and exogenous factors. The expert study revealed that the compiled gross list of critical factors was complete for indicating dynamics in production chains related to food safety risks. The only factor added was the human factor in the potato case (see Table 3). Based on this gross list of critical factors, the most important factors were filtered in the workshop by the three subgroups. In the second round of the workshop, the group discussion revealed that some factors were related and could be clustered for ease of quantifying the relative importance of the various factors. Furthermore, this round showed that selection of factors from the gross list was case-sensitive. In this regard, the stimulus for innovation (either endogenous, exogenous or consumer driven) played a less important role in the selection of critical factors than the product characteristics. Therefore, generalization of critical factors should preferably be based on product features, which should be further explored. For example, by comparing a \u2018simple\u2019 product with few ingredients with a more complex product, domestically produced products with imported products, or cooled products with fresh products.",

Therefore, it is necessary to filter the most important ones from this list (Marvin et al., 2009). In this paper, expert studies were used for ranking the critical factors. Experts used were divided over the cases according to their expertise. Many studies have been performed on the quality of expert judgements and what makes a person an expert (Bolger and Wright, 1994, Rowe and Wright, 2001). The choice of experts used in our case and the relative proportion in the group will have influenced the outcome of the study. A repetition of this study with another set of experts may thus give different ranking results. However, it is expected that, overall, the most important factors derived for each of the three cases will be identical, since experts used had considerable knowledge and experience in food safety and/or production processes. A different set of experts with comparable background is thus believed to result in the same factors as depicted in Table 4 (although the percentages may differ).",

            "text": "There are different ways in setting up an expert study varying from the use of individuals (isolated or coacting), statistical aggregates (such as pooled responses) or group processes. In general, group performance is qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the performance of the average individual (Hill, 1982). In our study, in-depth interviews with individual experts in the field were used as a starting point for the group discussion in the workshop. This may have influenced the group discussion; however, the advantage of this approach was that it facilitated clarification of the critical factors used. A consensus was not strived for, as can be seen in the different ratings between the group and the individual experts (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3). Selection of most important factors was based on discussion within a group of experts and subsequent ranking by the individual experts following a hybrid interacting/nominal procedure. One of the disadvantages of interacting groups is the dominance of higher status, more expressive or stronger personalities (Van de Ven & Delbecq, 1974). Another approach to filter most important items from a broad list of factors is the use of a group decision room. In this approach, factors are ranked individually and anonymously using a Delphi procedure on the computer (Rowe & Wright, 1999). Such an approach will give better insights in individual scores of various items, but has the disadvantage that factors may be interpreted differently among participants (Van de Ven & Delbecq, 1974). In our case, a uniform interpretation of the critical factors used was essential, therefore, interaction in a group was needed. Once this is established, evaluation of factors can be based on the same underlying definitions and the effect of misinterpretation can thus be minimized. The group discussions were followed by nominal voting allowing individual ranking with the group decision as the pooled outcome of the individual votes (Van de Ven & Delbecq, 1971). Combining individual forecasts to an average rate has in many fields shown to be the best or almost best method (Clemen, 1989). In our case the average score was used to identify the most important factors related to food safety risks.",
