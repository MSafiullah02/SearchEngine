While this detection may have a clinical significance, other factors may influence the stool positivity for influenza viruses. Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate demographical, clinical, and microbiological factors which could favor the presence of influenza viral RNA in the stools of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Methods: Acute respiratory infection (ARI) patients were enrolled by general practitioners (GP) during two winter seasons (2014-2016). Nasopharyngeal swabs, stool specimens, and clinical data were collected. Samples were tested for 12 respiratory pathogen groups (nasopharyngeal and stool specimens) and for 12 enteric pathogens (stool specimens). Results: Among the 331 patients with ARI enrolled by GP, 114 (34.4%) presented influenza infection. Influenza RNA was detected in stool samples of 21% (24/114) of the 114 stool specimens analyzed. Hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 7.8 (95% confidence interval (CI)) [1.7-33.7], P = .02), age between 45 and 64 years (aOR = 4.8 [1.7-14.5], P = .01), consumption of raw shellfish and/or mollusks (aOR = 16.7 [3.6-90.9], P = .00), and use of antibiotics (aOR = 6.4 [2.1-19.8], P = .006) or antiviral treatment (aOR = 7.4 [1.9-29], P = .01) were significantly associated with an increased odds of the detection of influenza RNA in stools. Among the 24 stool samples subjected to viral isolation, no one showed virus growth. Conclusions: These findings will be useful to studies investigating the dissemination route of influenza viruses to gastrointestinal tract.

These three factors are known to increase the risk of having diarrhea, vomiting, or mild stomach symptoms resulting from the disruption of the normal microflora from drug consumption 28, 29 or from the presence of enteric pathogens or toxin in food, or even intolerance to certain seafoods. 30 Similar to other studies, no association was found between GI symptoms and influenza detection. 31, 32 Interestingly, among the four patients who had influenza RNA exclusively in the stool and had consumed raw shellfish, and/or mollusks, three reported having GI symptoms, but none of the enteric pathogens screened here were detected in their stools. These symptoms could be caused by other enteric pathogens or allergy, 33 intolerance, 34 or toxin 35 responsible for GI symptoms and present on shellfish and mollusks. Among the patients with antibiotic or antiviral drug prescriptions, we did not collect data on GI symptom development after GP consultation, but stool samples were collected 2 days after GP consultation; therefore, patients had started antibiotic and/or antiviral treatment at time of stool collection. We could make the assumption that disruption of the gut microflora leads to an increase in swallowing and gastric flu, which helps influenza viruses reach the lower gastrointestinal tract. A recent study reported that swallowed influenza viruses become resistant to simulated gastric acid and bile/pancreatic juice and could be detected in stools if certain protective mechanisms such as viscous mucus protect it from degradation in the GI tract. 19 Limitations of this study include the observational study design for which residual bias cannot be excluded, and the small sample size resulting in wide confidence intervals. We did not carry out patient follow-up to collect clinical information after GP consultation. The detection of influenza virus in stool specimens may have been reduced due to inhibitory material present in the gastrointestinal tract and stool.
