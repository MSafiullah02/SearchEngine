First, although the family members were from 3 households, they all were infected directly or indirectly from the same 2 index patients. The clinical features were diverse across patients; in particular, there were 2 asymptomatic patients and 1 patient whose symptoms were so severe that he had to be transferred to ICU. Second, this cluster demonstrated that COVID-19 is transmittable during the incubation period, as the daughter and her family caught the disease during the incubation period of index 1 and index 2. Third, patients can stay asymptomatic, such as index 2 and case 4 in this cluster. Given that Zou et al [3] found that the viral load of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were similar, asymptomatic patients can still infect others. These \u201csilent patients\u201d may remain undiagnosed and be able to spread the disease to large numbers of people. Last, it appears that children may not be as susceptible to this new virus as adults and elderly persons, and they may fare better when they have contracted the virus. As reported in this family cluster, the 6-year-old child was not infected and the 13-month-old was infected but stayed asymptomatic.",
