Intensive supportive care and the need for strict isolation impaired clinical and instrumental assessment of the neurological aspect, despite being critical to determine prognosis.",

Indeed, this ZIK-V manifestation has peculiar characteristics that led to speculation about a possible different pathogenesis compared to classical GBS: (a) they seem to arise 5 to 10 days after infection and have higher morbidity, more frequent cranial neuropathies and concurrent immune-mediated disorders such as thrombocytopenic purpura [4]; (b) anti-glycolipids antibodies typically involved in cross-reactive mechanisms are not common [5]; (c) there is a predominant involvement of distal nerve segments [3], where the blood\u2013nerve barrier is lacking.",

The growing number of extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, the immunological nature of GBS itself, the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF and the delayed onset of paralysis in our patient might theoretically support the second hypothesis rather than a viral effect.",
