Additionally, we show that diarrhea is rare (3%). Such symptoms were not observed in another cohort of HCWs attending non-pilgrim patients in another region of Saudi Arabia during the same period of time. HCWs attending pilgrims reported symptoms that lasted up to 2 weeks. No symptomatic HCWs reported loss of workdays during the Hajj in our study, and the number of sick days because of illness post-Hajj was not recorded. Nevertheless, illness during or post-Hajj among HCWs does not only affect the wellbeing of the HCWs involved, but may also have an impact on work productivity, delivery of health care services, as well as potentially an economic cost. This is especially relevant during Hajj when the health care system is under a significant amount of stress and operating at near surge capacity in many Hajj areas. Numerous studies reported that employee absence is related to decreased job productivity and important economic costs including in the health care sector.13, 14, 15 Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the impact of Hajj-related illness among HCWs.",

These organisms have been shown to also be commonly carried by and transmitted among Hajj pilgrims.16, 17, 18 Significant acquisition of rhinovirus in superior airways of Mecca HCWs was recorded at a rate of 16.2%, whereas the acquisition rates of the 2 most frequently detected bacterial pathogens (K pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) among this cohort were 10.3% and 5.9%, respectively.

The role of HCWs as a vector for nosocomial infections is well established,27, 28 especially in relation to RTIs.27 Therefore, effective infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies in health care settings to reduce the likelihood of infection among HCWs and patients are crucial in the Hajj context. As such, the Saudi MOH has a strict IPC training and educational program for HCWs deployed for Hajj, beyond the standard training programs these HCWs undertake throughout the year in their own health care facilities across the Kingdom. This is because HCWs deployed during Hajj come from a wide range of health institutions in KSA with diverse backgrounds on IPC measures. Some may be stationed at seasonal hospitals in the Mecca holy sites that are only operational during Hajj and will be providing care to pilgrims originating from all over the world. Therefore, since 2016, the Saudi MOH requires all HCWs deployed during Hajj to complete training to acquire a basic infection control skills license (BICSL). The latter involves 5 basic components: proper hand hygiene, proper use of personal protective equipment, application of the N95 fit test, principles of safe injection practice, as well as compulsory influenza and meningococcal vaccination. For the 2017 Hajj, 14,029 HCWs were trained for the BICSL representing 100% of the targeted number to be trained.29\n",

In addition, various trainings and drills are conducted pre-Hajj for HCWs as per their function and in relation to a number of possible infectious risks such as MERS.

One possible contributor to this finding is that the influenza vaccination season in KSA for HCWs not deployed to Hajj runs from September to March. Given that our data collection was conducted mid-September, it is possible that a number of HCWs from the Al-Ahsa cohort did not yet receive their influenza vaccination at the time of the study. For HCWs deployed in Hajj, the rates of immunization in our study were similar to those reported in a study conducted in the 2015-2017 Hajj seasons.32 However, our data indicates that the rate of immunization of influenza vaccination among the Hajj cohort was higher than that reported pre-2015.19, 20 In general, since the introduction of the compulsory BICSL license that includes the compulsory influenza and meningococcal immunization section, data from the MOH indicate that in 2017, all HCWs deployed to Hajj were vaccinated with both vaccines.",
