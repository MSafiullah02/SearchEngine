Using these host-pathogen interactions to their advantage, pathogens attach, invade, disseminate, and evade host defense mechanisms to promote their survival in the hostile host environment. Many viruses, bacteria, and parasites express adhesins that bind to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) to facilitate their initial attachment and subsequent cellular entry. Some pathogens also secrete virulence factors that modify HSPG expression. HSPGs are ubiquitously expressed on the cell surface of adherent cells and in the extracellular matrix. HSPGs are composed of one or several heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains attached covalently to specific core proteins. For most intracellular pathogens, cell surface HSPGs serve as a scaffold that facilitates the interaction of microbes with secondary receptors that mediate host cell entry. Consistent with this mechanism, addition of HS or its pharmaceutical functional mimic, heparin, inhibits microbial attachment and entry into cultured host cells, and HS-binding pathogens can no longer attach or enter cultured host cells whose HS expression has been reduced by enzymatic treatment or chemical mutagenesis. In pathogens where the specific HS adhesin has been identified, mutant strains lacking HS adhesins are viable and show normal growth rates, suggesting that the capacity to interact with HSPGs is strictly a virulence activity. The goal of this chapter is to provide a mechanistic overview of our current understanding of how certain microbial pathogens subvert HSPGs to promote their infection, using specific HSPGpathogen interactions as representative examples.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The complex interplay between hosts and pathogens has many common themes. One of the first steps in infection is attachment to host tissues. The expression pattern of host cell surface proteins that serve as receptors for pathogen attachment has a significant role in determining the initiation, progression, outcome, and tissue tropism of infections. Among these, HSPGs are expressed ubiquitously on the surface of adherent cells and in the extracellular matrix (ECM), and many viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens have been described to interact with HSPGs (Rostand and Esko 1997; Bernfield et al. 1999; Spillmann 2001; Chen et al. 2008) . HSPGs bind to and regulate growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, and ECM components (Bernfield et al. 1999; Park et al. 2000 ; Bartlett et al. 2008) and are known to be involved in processes as diverse as wound healing (Fears and Woods 2006; Alexopoulou et al. 2007) , angiogenesis (Stringer 2006) , and neuronal development (Reizes et al. 2008) . HSPGs are composed of a protein core to which one or more heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are covalently attached. HS chains can be both N-and O-sulfated, and it is with these chains that most pathogens interact.

The role of the highly conserved cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-1 in shedding regulation is becoming clear. The three invariant Tyr residues are required for agonist-induced syndecan-1 shedding, but Tyr phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain is not (Hayashida et al. 2008) . Instead the cytoplasmic domain modulates syndecan-1 shedding by interacting with critical regulators of shedding. One such regulator identified recently is Rab5. Rab5 is a small GTP-binding protein, whose GDP-bound inactive form binds preferentially to the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-1 (Hayashida et al. 2008) . Stimulation of cells with syndecan-1 shedding agonists induces the activation of Rab5 and dissociation of activated GTP-bound Rab5 from the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain, suggesting that Rab5 regulates syndecan-1 shedding by serving as an on-off switch of shedding through its alternation between GDP-and GTP-bound states (Hayashida et al. 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 238, "text": "(Li et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 239, "end": 256, "text": "Ding et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 280, "end": 299, "text": "(Brule et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 319, "end": 337, "text": "(Endo et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 358, "end": 383, "text": "(Pruessmeyer et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 604, "end": 628, "text": "(Fitzgerald et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 654, "end": 679, "text": "(Subramanian et al. 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 680, "end": 703, "text": "Fitzgerald et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 742, "end": 766, "text": "(Fitzgerald et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 767, "end": 783, "text": "Park et al. 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}, {"start": 784, "end": 802, "text": "Park et al. , 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 803, "end": 821, "text": "Chung et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1099, "text": "(Hayashida et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1415, "text": "(Hayashida et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1763, "text": "(Hayashida et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Primer on HSPG Biology"}, {"text": "Shed glypican ectodomains have been detected in cell culture media (Mertens et al. 1996; Fitzgerald et al. 2000) , suggesting that glypicans are also shed.

Heparin, but not dermatan sulfate or CS, blocked the attachment of pseudovirions to COS-7 cells (Giroglou et al. 2001) . In agreement with this, treatment of cells with heparinase also blocked the ability of pseudovirions to attach (Giroglou et al. 2001) . As is the case for other pathogens, HSPGs serve as low-affinity, but abundant, primary attachment receptors and a secondary receptor mediates internalization of HPVs. Christensen et al. (1995) found that neutralizing antibodies against VLPs were effective in preventing internalization up to 8 h after infection -without affecting the ability of the VLPs When it encounters a highly sulfated HSPG (light blue) as is found in hepatocytes, CSP is cleaved and the remaining molecule is internalized to attach to host cells (Christensen et al. 1995) . Giroglou et al. (2001) extended the understanding of the timing of attachment and internalization: both neutralizing antibodies and heparin were able to decrease infectivity when added early after infection, but the ability of heparin to decrease infectivity diminished over a shorter time course. The authors propose that virions may initially bind to a single proteoglycan -from which they can easily be displaced by free heparin. Over time, more proteoglycan molecules are recruited and bind to each virion, making it less susceptible to competitive detachment by heparin, but still accessible to neutralizing antibodies which block attachment to a secondary receptor required for internalization (Giroglou et al. 2001) . Studies comparing the ability of chemically modified heparins to inhibit infection have shown that VLP binding requires only O-sulfation of heparin, but pseudovirus infection requires both N-and O-sulfation (Selinka et al. 2003) .

HSPG-mediated attachment of L1 to a variety of cell types is an important first step in establishing infection. Following this initial binding, it is thought that the minor capsid protein L2 binds to a different receptor and mediates internalization. Consistent with this mechanism, it has been shown that virions with L1 and L2 have increased infectivity over virions with only L1 (Unckell et al. 1997; Yeager et al. 2000; Roden et al. 2001 ). In addition, neither anti-L2 neutralizing antibody (Roden et al. 1994a (Roden et al. , b, 1995 nor deletion of either the N-or C-terminus of L2 can block virion binding to the host cell surface (Yang et al. 2003 ). In the case of HPV16, the L2 residues responsible for facilitating infection (aa residues 13-31) are not displayed on the capsid surface (Kawana et al. 1998 (Kawana et al. , 1999 , whereas a neighboring series of residues (aa residues 32-81) are present (Heino et al. 1995; Liu et al. 1997) . This suggests a model in which HSPG binding of capsid protein L1 leads to a conformational change exposing residues on L2 that can then bind a secondary receptor to enhance infectivity. Richards et al. (2006) identified a host enzyme responsible for cleavage of the N-terminal residues, the proprotein convertase furin, which acts after the conformational change has occurred (Richards et al. 2006) . The importance of this conformational change was highlighted by reports that L1specific neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination with HPV 16-VLP do not prevent attachment of mature virus to the host cell surface, but rather inhibit infection by preventing the conformational change of L2 (Day et al. 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 466, "end": 487, "text": "(Unckell et al. 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF218"}, {"start": 488, "end": 507, "text": "Yeager et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 508, "end": 525, "text": "Roden et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 580, "end": 599, "text": "(Roden et al. 1994a", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 600, "end": 623, "text": "(Roden et al. , b, 1995", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 723, "end": 740, "text": "(Yang et al. 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 881, "end": 900, "text": "(Kawana et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 901, "end": 922, "text": "(Kawana et al. , 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1017, "text": "(Heino et al. 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1034, "text": "Liu et al. 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1245, "text": "Richards et al.

It attaches to hepatocytes through interaction with HSPGs, and this binding can be inhibited by heparinase treatment (Frevert et al. 1993) .

Thus, it was hypothesized that the degree of sulfation, rather than simply the presence of HSPGs, was the key factor that allows sporozoites to migrate through multiple cell types and invade hepatocytes. Consistent with this, inhibition of sulfation decreased sporozoite migration (Humphries and Silbert 1988) , and experiments of sporozoite migration in dermal fibroblasts, ECs, and hepatocytes showed that overall sulfation level of the cell type correlated inversely with migratory activity (Coppi et al. 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 394, "end": 418, "text": "(Sharma and Pathak 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 538, "end": 559, "text": "(Frevert et al. 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 697, "end": 725, "text": "(Lindblom and Fransson 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 726, "end": 742, "text": "Lyon et al. 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1055, "text": "(Humphries and Silbert 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1259, "text": "(Coppi et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 129, "text": "(Fig. 2.1c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "HSPGs in Tissue Tropism of Pathogens"}, {"text": "Further study has shown that the HSPG-CSP interaction may regulate the proteolytic cleavage of CSP.

Common clinical syndromes associated with T. gondii infection include abortion and congenital infection as well as systemic and central nervous system infections in immunocompromised hosts (Kim and Weiss 2008) . Infection is transmitted through ingestion of undercooked meats (especially pork) or contact with infected feces from the definitive hosts (felids), although water containing oocysts has been increasingly identified as a source of outbreaks (Kim and Weiss 2008) . As an obligate intracellular parasite, T. gondii has a complicated life cycle requiring invasion of host cells and formation of a parasitophorus vacuole where the organism can evade host defenses and develop into tachyzoites. Tachyzoites differentiate into bradyzoites, which are contained in thick-walled cysts inside the parasitophorous vacuole and can persist indefinitely -or reactivate if the host becomes immunocompromised (Kim and Weiss 2008) . The first role identified for HSPGs in T. gondii infection is its attachment to host cells (Carruthers et al. 2000) . Because T. gondii can infect a wide range of mammalian hosts and can invade nearly all mammalian and avian cell types, Carruthers et al. (2000) hypothesized that the T. gondii receptor is an abundantly expressed and ubiquitous cell surface molecule, such as GAGs (Carruthers et al. 2000) .

Further, enzymatic removal of HS or CS from the cell surface demonstrated that HS was more important than CS in parasite attachment (Carruthers et al. 2000) . Decreased attachment to CHO cells with a defect in NDST-1, an enzyme responsible for N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc in HS, was seen in vitro (Ortega-Barria and Boothroyd 1999), suggesting the importance of a specific HS modification in attachment.

These data suggest that both a-toxin and b-toxin activate a similar PTK-dependent, metalloproteinase-mediated shedding mechanism of host cells.

The capacity of b-toxin to induce syndecan-1 shedding is dependent on its sphingomyelinase activity because mutant proteins lacking this activity failed to trigger shedding and cause lung injury when inoculated intranasally (Hayashida et al. 2009 ). Consistent with these data, Sdc1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice injected with purified b-toxin showed minimal inflammation, supporting the role of S. aureus b-toxin and its sphingomyelinase activity in enhancing syndecan-1 shedding leading to pulmonary inflammation and injury (Hayashida et al. 2009 ).

Shedding of the syndecan-1-IL-8 complex creates a chemotactic gradient guiding neutrophils to migrate into the airspace leading to inflammation and tissue damage S. pneumoniae induces syndecan-1 shedding from the surface of host cells in culture. However, available data indicate that S. pneumoniae directly sheds syndecan-1 ectodomains (Chen et al. 2007b ). As such, the size of syndecan-1 ectodomains shed by S. pneumoniae is smaller than ectodomains produced by constitutive shedding. More importantly, ZmpC, one of the pneumococcal zinc metalloproteinases, has been shown to possess syndecan-1 sheddase activity in vitro (Chen et al. 2007b ).

However, the fact that the majority of intracellular pathogens exploit cell surface HSPGs for its attachment and cellular invasion also suggest that syndecan shedding is a host defense mechanism that rapidly and transiently downregulates microbial attachment sites. Perhaps only highly effective pathogens, such as S. aureus, have adapted or evolved to subvert this innate host mechanism. Future studies should be directed at testing the physiological significance of HSPG-pathogen interaction using animal models of infection that simulate human disease. In vivo studies using mice deficient in specific HS biosynthetic enzymes and mice deficient in certain HSPGs or HS enzymes in a cell-specific manner should also be attempted to define the molecular and cellular features of the HSPG-pathogen interaction.

Because available data suggest that the capacity to subvert HSPGs to promote infection is a pathogenic mechanism used by many pathogens, the HSPG-pathogen interaction is a potential candidate for novel antimicrobial therapy against a broad range of infectious diseases. For example, de Witte et al. (2008) showed that papillomavirus VLPs interact with HSPGs on the surface of DCs, as binding can be prevented by treatment of DCs with heparinase II. As DCs express syndecan-3 and play a critical role in immunity against HPVs, the HS moiety of syndecan-3 may be a target for anti-HPV therapy. Similarly, periodate-cleaved heparin fragments that lack antithrombin-III binding activity and thus lack anticoagulant properties have been shown to retain several key functions that may have therapeutic benefits in the treatment of severe malaria; they can block merozoite invasion of erythrocytes, disrupt rosettes, inhibit endothelial binding of Plasmodium in vitro and reverse sequestration in vivo in rat and macaque models of malaria (Vogt et al. 2006) . These data suggest that low molecular weight HS/heparin compounds that do not cause the unwanted side effects of heparin therapy, such as bleeding and thrombocytopenia, are potential candidates for antimalarial therapy.
