Commonly called vampire bats, these nocturnal flying mammals have a body length of roughly 3 in and a wingspan up to 15 in. They usually weigh 20\u201350 g and live up to 12 years in the wild. Their short fur is grayish on the underside of the body and darker gray to brown on the back.",

Each wing has a well-developed, clawed thumb. Unlike most other bats, vampire bats can maneuver on land, moving with a unique, bounding gait that is driven by the forelimbs rather than the hindlimbs, as the wings are much more powerful than the legs2.",

They land near the animal, approach it on all fours and use their clawed thumbs to climb onto it. Their thermoreceptors use infrared radiation to find a location where warm blood is flowing just beneath the animal's skin3. They create a small incision with their teeth and then lap up the blood with their tongue. Enzymes in their saliva prevent the blood from clotting while they feed. The bats usually drink for 20\u201330 minutes and remove about 30 ml of blood, which is not enough to harm the host; however, their bites can transmit infections and disease.",

Dubbed desmoteplase, Desmodus salivary plasminogen activator (DSPA) or draculin, this anti-clotting agent has been synthesized and is being studied to find out if it can help prevent or dissolve blood clots in humans4. If blood clots form and break loose, they may travel through the bloodstream and block vessels in the lungs or brain, leading to pulmonary embolism or stroke, respectively, and potentially resulting in death. Clinical trials continue to evaluate desmoteplase as a treatment for pulmonary emboli and stroke5. Initial trials showed that the drug broke up blood clots quickly, restoring blood flow and improving clinical outcome6.",

Typically, lifespan correlates with size in mammals: smaller mammals have shorter lifespans and larger ones live longer. Several explanations have been proposed for bats' long lives: lowered energy expenditure thanks to hibernation and daily torpor; lack of predation pressure; and low reproductive rates. One study of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) and cave myotis bats (Myotis velifer) suggests that preservation of protein structure is essential to bats' long lifespans8.",
