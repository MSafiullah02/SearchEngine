Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19, specifically in the epidemic region. Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of COVID-19 patients. However, the chest CT-based COVID-19 classification involves a radiology expert and considerable time, which is valuable when COVID-19 infection is growing at rapid rate. Therefore, an automated analysis of chest CT images is desirable to save the medical professionals' precious time. In this paper, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used to classify the COVID-19-infected patients as infected (+ve) or not (\u2212ve). Additionally, the initial parameters of CNN are tuned using multiobjective differential evolution (MODE). Extensive experiments are performed by considering the proposed and the competitive machine learning techniques on the chest CT images. Extensive analysis shows that the proposed model can classify the chest CT images at a good accuracy rate.",

The Chinese Government reported that the diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [7] . However, RT-PCR suffers from high false-negative rates and timeconsuming [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The low sensitivity of RT-PCR is not acceptable in the current epidemic situation. In some cases, the infected people may not be recognized and get suitable treatment on time. The infected people may get spread the virus to healthy people due to communicable nature of nCoV. It is observed from clinical reported of infected peoples that there is bilateral change in chest computed tomography (CT) images [8] . Therefore, chest CT has been used as alternative tool to detect the infection caused by nCoV due to high sensitivity [12] . The National Health Commission of China reported that chest CT can be utilized to detect the infection caused by nCoV [3] . A large amount of pathological information can be obtained from chest CT. The radiologists are required to analyze the images of chest CT. Hence, there is a necessity to develop a deep learning-based prediction technique for analysis of chest CT without intervention of radiologist.",

A multiobjective fitness function is designed to classify COVID-19-infected patients by considering sensitivity and specificity. The hyperparameters of CNN are optimized by using the MODE algorithm. The proposed model is trained by considering the chest CT images of COVID-19 patients.

[14] studied the sensitivity of RT-PCR and chest CT during the detection of COVID-19. They analyzed the travel history and symptoms of 2 patients and found that the sensitivity of chest CT for detection of COVID-19 is much higher than RT-PCR. Xie et al. [13] also reported that the 3% of 167 patients had negative RT-PCR for COVID-19 detection. However, chest CT has better sensitivity of detection of COVID-19 over RT-PCR. Berheim et al. [23] studied 121 infected patients' chest CT from four different centers of China. The relationship between CT scan and symptom onset is established. They found that the severity of disease increased with time from onset of symptoms and designated the signs of disease.

They used visual features to distinguish between community acquired pneumonia and other nonpneumonia lung diseases. However, COVNet is unable to categorize the severity of this disease. Gozes et al. [25] developed an artificial intelligence-based CT analysis tool for detecting and quantification of COVID-19. The system extracted slice of opacities in the lungs automatically. The developed system achieved 98.2% sensitivity and 92.2% specificity. The output of system provides quantitative opacity measure and 3D volume display for opacities. The system is robust against pixel spacing and slice thickness [25] . Shan et al. [26] developed a deep learning-based system named VB-net for automatic segmentation of all the lung and infection sites using chest CT. Xu et al. [8] developed a prediction model to discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia and influenza-A viral pneumonia using deep learning techniques. The CNN model was used for prediction. The maximum accuracy obtained from prediction model was 86.7%. Wang et al. [9] investigated the radiographic changes in CT images of infected patients. They developed a deep learning-based prediction model that utilizes the modified inception transfer learning technique. The features are extracted from CT images for prior diagnosis. The accuracy of 89.5% obtained from this method is better than Xu's model [8] and saved time for diagnosis. Narin et al. [11] proposed an automatic deep convolution neural networkbased transfer models for prediction of COVID-19 in chest Xray images. They used InceptionV3, Inception-ResNetV2, and ResNet50 models for better prediction. The ResNet50 pre-trained model produced accuracy of 98%, which is higher than [8, 9] . Sethy et al. [10] developed a deep learning model for detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images. They extracted deep features and transferred them to support vector machine for classification. The accuracy of 95.38% obtained from the proposed model, which is better than [8, 9] .",

The proposed MODE-based CNN and competitive classification models are applied on the training data. To prevent the overfitting, 20-fold cross-validation is also utilized. Finally, the comparisons are drawn between the competitive and proposed classification models by considering different fractions of training and testing dataset.
