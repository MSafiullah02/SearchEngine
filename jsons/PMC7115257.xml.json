Questionnaire items were designed on the basis of the working experience of a panel of public health nurses. The questionnaire went through a content validation process. Six experts from public health or community nursing fields served as the expert panel in checking the validity of questionnaire items. The drafted questionnaire was piloted for understandability among 5 public health nurses in northern Taiwan. Moreover, within 1 week after the questionnaires were returned, the researchers randomly selected and phoned 32 respondents (approximately 10% of the total) to check the reliability of their written answers. The test/retest reliability for this questionnaire was high (Pearson correlation coefficients for continuous variables: 0.87-0.97; Spearman rank correlation coefficients for categorical variables: 0.90-0.97).",

In the fourth section of the questionnaire (also using 10-point Likert scale), the nurses were asked to assess the severity of the epidemic, the public's awareness of the epidemic situation, the public's fear of SARS, and the public's compliance with official quarantine measures. Finally, the nurses were asked to list major difficulties they encountered in managing the SARS epidemic.",

Survey respondents were mainly head nurses with more than 10 years of health center experience and were very familiar with their organizations, clients, communities, and issues surrounding quarantine operations. Furthermore, because they were required to interact directly with quarantined persons, they had the best opportunity to understand the community's response to the SARS outbreak.15 Also, because the survey was conducted just after the SARS epidemic had peaked, the related experiences were fresh in their minds, and recall bias would have been minimal. Therefore, this report can be a valuable reference for the control and management of SARS-like contagious disease outbreaks.",

As shown in Table 1, most public health nurses (71.9%) believed that the outbreak would not end until mid-September or even later. There was at least a 2-month difference between frontline nurses' estimates and the actual timing of the epidemic's end, indicating a low confidence level on the part of the nurses. This is serious because the pessimistic attitudes of nurses could affect the morale of quarantined subjects, people in the community, and, eventually, the success of the SARS control program.",

As shown in Table 2, individual risk perception, working environment of the health centers, and epidemic severity in the community were contributing factors. During the SARS epidemic, the Taiwan government made efforts, via media announcements, to assure the public that the situation was under control. From May 2003, all major television channels broadcast daily the \u201cSARS Front-line\u201d program on the evening news. The premier and the commander of the Anti-SARS Task Force also repeatedly delivered public announcements that said the outbreak would soon be over.17, 18, 19 However, these optimistic public announcements were not always trusted by frontline nurses. The daily epidemic reports received by the nurses always seemed to be outdated. As the severity of the epidemic lessened day by day, the outdated data that showed a more severe phase of epidemic were counterproductive to boosting nurses' trust in the government's optimistic announcements. It appears that providing public health nurses with rapidly updated information is of utmost importance. Results also show that risk communication at the time of infectious disease outbreak should be based on timely, rapidly updated, and evidence-based data to supplement routine government announcements.",

Results indicated that lower confidence levels were associated with fewer cases in the community (Table 2). Without an immediate threat, health centers in counties/cities with few SARS cases might not have fully mobilized their community resources to prepare the public or their nurses for SARS prevention and control measures. Because the national media broadcasted sensationally on the severity of SARS epidemics, public health nurses without sufficient preparation and support might have been more vulnerable to rumors and speculation about negative aspects of the outbreak such as mortality rate, resulting in a loss of confidence in organized efforts to control the SARS epidemic.",

According to the aforementioned traditional chain of command in the Taiwanese public health bureaucracy, when the SARS policy was developed, standard procedures for field operations were decided by the national office. Without having policy fine-tuned with input from frontline nurses, this top-down policy could not promptly respond to local needs that changed rapidly according to the disastrous nature of SARS contingencies. It is obvious that the long-established champion of the Taiwanese public health system needs an effective feedback mechanism to renovate its response to newly emerging infectious outbreaks. A platform that encourages participatory decision making involving health professionals at all levels should be critically emphasized in developing a national policy to control SARS-like outbreaks of pandemic contagion.",

This was independent of local epidemic severity but significantly related to people's cognitive preparedness and the efficiency of interagency collaborations (Table 3). Quarantine restricts the movement of people who can potentially expose others to a disease.20, 21 How to implement effectively a community-wide quarantine therefore presents a major challenge to health agencies. Table 3 shows that people who were less knowledgeable about the SARS outbreak and those who expressed little fear of infection were less compliant in following anti-SARS measures. In the future, more efforts should be placed on educating people to increase their health knowledge and beliefs, especially about risk susceptibility and severity, and belief in the benefits of taking health actions.22, 23 Moreover, effective community health education programs that emphasize community-based participatory research and education should be considered.24, 25 From a national perspective, a comprehensive SARS control strategy should also be developed that would streamline communication and resource sharing among health agencies at all levels.",
