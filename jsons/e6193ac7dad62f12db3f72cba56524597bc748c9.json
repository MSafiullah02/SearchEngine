In their 28 trial analysis of DCB and drug-eluting stents (DES) (4,663 patients) at 1 year, 12 trials (2,316 patients) at 2 years, and 3 trials (863 patients) at 4 to 5 years follow-up, they claimed an overall 1.9 (95% CI 1.27-2.93) increased relative risk and a 6.6% increased absolute risk of all-cause mortality in patients exposed to both a DCB and DES, compared to controls. Results of additional data analyses, revealed at a June 2019, 2-day U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Medical Device Advisory Panel Meeting, did little to provide clarity. The FDA's internal meta-analyses of industry-sponsored, pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concluded that there was a 1.57 (95% CI, 1.16-2.13) increase in relative risk over 5-yrs. (2) Ultimately, the Advisory Panel concluded that, indeed, there was a late mortality signal present, but given the small sample size, missing data, lack of apparent dose-related effect, lack of potential physiologic mechanism, the finding should be interpreted with caution, given the remaining uncertainty of the risk magnitude and its impact on benefit/risk consideration of device use. (8) Ultimately, the Agency recommended that PTX devices be reserved for patients judged to be at \"high-risk\" for restenosis, in which the benefits of device use may outweigh their risk of use and updated device labeling to communicate the mortality risk (3). However, despite these pronouncements, the PTX mortality concern persists as an unresolved controversy, slowing patient enrollment clinical trials of PTX-coated devices in other vascular beds, consuming innumerable regulatory agency and societal financial and human 3 resources, and prompted realignment of strategic investments and device development toward non-PTX coated devices.

            "text": "The inclusion of this large, retrospective observational dataset must come with full acknowledgment of the potential inherent bias. Observational studies and randomized trials can contribute complementary evidence about the effects of treatments on mortality and non-fatal outcomes. However, due to the inherent potential for moderate and large biases, the role of observational studies is generally limited, as potential biases can obscure, over-estimate, and even reverse the real effect of the treatment under question. As such, their role in the direct assessment of the impact of a particular treatment on a major outcome (i.e., mortality) must be carefully scrutinized (9, 10) . First, it is essential to acknowledge the possible multiple confounding variables, extraneous influences, which may impact a conclusion. In this regard, Bohme et al., note that their analysis is a single-center study, casting doubt on generalizing their conclusions. More importantly, they fail to advise the reader of the risk of a substantial selection bias introduced by selecting only 800 patients from a database of over 7,000 patients. The study initiation period began in 2011, a timeframe in which both treatments were available. The nonrandom assignment interjects another selection bias: Over the six-year observation period, the ratio of patients who received DCB vs. POBA reversed, with DCB use increasing >200%. It may be unlikely that those not selected for analysis and received POBA in 2011 were different than those in 2017. Moreover, the rigor of the propensity score modeling is unstated; reliance on statistical significance for model selection rather than principles of causality and assessment of balance after matching are critical issues. (11) Furthermore, the potential for informational bias is a concern when such observational studies use electronic medical records to identify patients with preexisting conditions or who have undergone previous procedures that can be reported or that have been incorrectly/incompletely reported. As a result, such misclassification may distort the association between treatment exposure and outcome and alter conclusions. Importantly, the extent of potential attrition bias, those patients loss-to-follow-up was not fully defined. While the investigators acknowledge that when mortality could not be discerned in their database, either the patient or patient's physician was called. However, the exact loss-to-follow-up rates in the two treatment arms were not disclosed. Attrition bias is particularly concerning when it is unequal between treatment arms, as patients with missing vital status data may have poorer outcomes. Moreover, the inability of the investigators to define the cause of death in nearly half of the cases detracts from any inference of a potential mortality benefit of DCB use.",

Bohme et. al., leave many questions unanswered, including the mechanism of observed increase in late term POBA-related mortality and how the risk/benefit profile of these devices may shift across patient populations. Regardless, critical analysis of any conclusion is part of a larger story that builds a body of knowledge and allows for the further consideration of the effect of DCBs vs. POBA on mortality, if any. However, as our medical community turns to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, this PTX mortality issue will take its rightful 'back burner' place to our more pressing concerns.",

The superior effectiveness of DCBs, as compared to PTA, led to their widespread clinical use and inclusion in societal patient treatment guidelines. However, the December 2018 publication by Katsanos et al, (1) upended the use of this standard of interventional care in patients with life-style limiting claudication. In their 28 trial analysis of DCB and drug-eluting stents (DES) (4,663 patients) at 1 year, 12 trials (2,316 patients) at 2 years, and 3 trials (863 patients) at 4 to 5 years follow-up, they claimed an overall 1.9 (95% CI 1.27-2.93) increased relative risk and a 6.6% increased absolute risk of all-cause mortality in patients exposed to both a DCB and DES, compared to controls.
