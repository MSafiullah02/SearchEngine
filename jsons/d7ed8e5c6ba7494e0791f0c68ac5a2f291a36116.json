The early stages allow definitive oncological treatment without the need for further hospital admission or for adjuvant treatments. (low risk of infection) Stage IIa: SURGERY (low risk of infection) Stage IIb: Discuss with the patient also the possibility of a follow-up (up to 3 months) before a definitive therapeutic decision, once the epidemiological peak has been overcome. Personalized treatments are examined. Stage III: consider exclusive non-surgical treatments This algorithm of care tries to balance the risk of dying from cancer with the risk of incurring in a potentially fatal infection after major surgery or any onclological treatment. It is partially evidencebased and mostly based on common sense and on the need of supporting the current emergency without forgetting our patients.",
