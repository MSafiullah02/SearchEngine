The authors in particular recommend the use of the qingfei paidu decoction (QPD) which contains a large number of primary constituents, outlined in the article [1] . The quoted efficacy of this compound is a cure rate of \"over 90 %\" [1] . Although this figure sounds impressive, when compared to the current mortality rate attributed to the novel coronavirus, of between 1-3 %, its suggested therapeutic effect may be no better than placebo. We note the authors are not alone in promoting a role of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19, with the use of TCM appearing in recent guidelines derived from the initial epicentre of the disease in Wuhan China [2] .",

Initially the association between traditional herbal therapies and pneumonitis was based on isolated case reports. These included hypersensitivity pneumonitis associated with the use of traditional Chinese or Japanese medicines such as Sai-rei-to, Oren-gedokuto, Seisin-renshi-in and Otsu-ji-to (9 references in supplemental file). Larger cohorts and greater numbers now support this crucial relationship. In a Japanese cohort of 73 patients, pneumonitis development occurred within 3 months of commencing traditional medicine in the majority of patients [3] , while a large report from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, described more than 1000 cases of lung injury secondary to traditional medications, the overwhelming majority of which (852 reports) were described as 'interstitial lung disease [4] .",

Notably, skullcap is a constituent of QPD as used and described in the paper by Ren et al. relating to COVID-19 [1] . Scutellariae Radix-induced ARDS and COVID-19 disease share the same characteristic chest CT changes such as ground-glass opacities and airspace consolidation, therefore distinguishing between lung injury due to SARS-CoV-2 and that secondary to TCM may be very challenging. The potential for iatrogenic lung injury with TCM needs to be acknowledged [5] .",

Factors which impose a burden on lung function such as chronic lung disease and smoking are associated with increased risk for a poor outcome.

Against this background the use of agents with little or no evidence of clinical efficacy and which have been significantly implicated in causing interstitial pneumonitis that could complicate SARS-CoV-2 infection, should be considered with extreme caution.",
