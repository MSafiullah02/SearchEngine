Recommendation accuracy became the most studied aspect of the quality of the suggestions. However, novel and diverse suggestions also contribute to user satisfaction. Unfortunately, it is common to harm those two aspects when optimizing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we present EER, a linear model for the top-N recommendation task, which takes advantage of user and item embeddings for improving novelty and diversity without harming accuracy.",

The second family, collaborative filtering, is composed of systems that exploit the past interactions of the users with the items to compute the recommendations [10, 17] . These interactions can take several forms, such as ratings, clicks, purchases. Finally, hybrid approaches combine both to generate suggestions. Collaborative Filtering (CF) systems can be divided into memory-based systems, that use the information about these interactions directly to compute the recommendations, and model-based systems, that build models from this information that are later used to make the recommendations.",

These systems can be evaluated using traditional IR metrics over the rankings [2, 4] . In that evaluation approach, accuracy is usually the most important metric and has been the focus of previous research and competitions [3] . Nevertheless, other properties are also important, such as diversity and novelty [8, 13] . Diversity is the ability of the system to make recommendations that include items equitably from the whole catalog, which is usually desired by vendors [5, 22] . On the other hand, novelty is the capacity of the system to produce unexpected recommendations. This characteristic is a proxy for serendipity, associated with higher user engagement and satisfaction [6] . All these properties, accuracy, diversity and novelty, are linked to the extent that raising accuracy usually lowers the best achievable results in the other properties [11] .",

We perform a Wilcoxon test [18] to asses the statistical significance of the improvements regarding nDCG@100 and MSI@100, with p < 0.01.

ELP, on the other hand, obtains the best diversity and novelty values, but this comes with a big reduction in accuracy. It is common in the field of recommender systems for methods with lower accuracy to have higher values in diversity and novelty. We believe that the ability of the embeddings to find nonlinear relationships contributes to the model novelty and diversity. This property of the model allows it, for example, to discover relationships between popular and not so popular items leading to better diversity. Moreover, the integration in the linear model allows to keep its advantage in terms on accuracy, clearly suparssing the use of embeddings in isolatation (ELP).",
