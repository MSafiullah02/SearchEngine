            "text": "Human siglecs are a family of 14 sialic acid-binding proteins, most of which are expressed on subsets of immune cells where they regulate immune responses. Siglec-8 is expressed selectively on human allergic inflammatory cells-primarily eosinophils and mast cells-where engagement causes eosinophil apoptosis and inhibits mast cell mediator release. Evidence supports a model in which human eosinophils and mast cells bind to Siglec-8 sialoglycan ligands on inflammatory target tissues to resolve allergic inflammation and limit tissue damage. To identify Siglec-8-binding sialoglycans from human airways, proteins extracted from postmortem human trachea were resolved by size-exclusion chromatography and composite agarose-acrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted and probed by Siglec-8-Fc blot overlay. Three size classes of Siglec-8 ligands were identified: 250 kDa, 600 kDa and 1 MDa, each of which was purified by affinity chromatography using a recombinant pentameric form of Siglec-8. Proteomic mass spectrometry identified all size classes as the proteoglycan aggrecan, a finding validated by immunoblotting. Glycan array studies demonstrated Siglec-8 binding to synthetic glycans with a terminal Neu5Ac\u03b12-3(6-sulfo)-Gal determinant, a quantitatively minor terminus on keratan sulfate (KS) chains of aggrecan. Treating human tracheal extracts with sialidase or keratanase eliminated Siglec-8 binding, indicating sialylated KS chains as Siglec-8-binding determinants. Treating human tracheal histological sections with keratanase also completely eliminated the binding of Siglec-8-Fc. Finally, Siglec-8 ligand purified from human trachea extracts induced increased apoptosis of freshly isolated human eosinophils in vitro. We conclude that sialylated KS proteoglycans are endogenous human airway ligands that bind Siglec-8 and may regulate allergic inflammation.",

Among the regulators of inflammation are members of the siglec family, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins, most of which are expressed on overlapping sets of immune cells and many of which carry intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains that aid in resolution of immune responses (Macauley et al. 2014) .",

Siglec-8 is a transmembrane protein with its outermost N-terminal Ig-like domain mediating sialic acid glycan binding and its intracellular domain carrying ITIM and ITIM-like domains. Experimental antibody-induced cross-linking of Siglec-8 on the surface of eosinophils results in transmembrane signaling that induces eosinophil apoptosis , whereas crosslinking Siglec-8 on mast cells inhibits release of immune mediators (Yokoi et al. 2008) . Notably, the effects of cross-linking Siglec-8 are greater when inflammatory cells are in the active rather than quiescent state (Nutku-Bilir et al. 2008) , suggesting that Siglec-8mediated downregulation of inflammatory cells is a natural step in resolving ongoing allergic inflammation to limit tissue damage. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of human Siglec-8 gene polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to asthma (Gao et al. 2010) . A current hypothesis consistent with the data is that Siglec-8 on allergic inflammatory cells engages polyvalent complementary binding sialoglycans on target tissues as an integral step in resolving and appropriately limiting allergic inflammation. The identity and regulation of the Siglec-8-binding sialoglycans on inflammatory target tissues is the focus of ongoing investigations.",

Using lectin overlay histochemistry of postmortem lower human airways, we found that Siglec-8 ligands are strongly expressed in tracheal and bronchial submucosal glands and cartilage. Mouse airways failed to bind Siglec-8-Fc, consistent with the absence of both Siglec-8 and Siglec-8 ligands in mouse airways. Furthermore, we found Siglec-8 ligands were extracted from human airway tissues using guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl) (but not nonionic detergents), were resolved by composite agarose-acrylamide electrophoresis primarily as very large-molecular weight species and were O-linked glycans but did not co-migrate with any single major airway mucin (Yu et al. 2017 ). In the current study, we purified Siglec-8 ligands from human tracheal extracts by sequential size-exclusion chromatography and affinity chromatography, identified them by proteomic mass spectrometry, validated the candidate molecules and revealed that sialylated KS proteoglycan(s) are the primary carrier of Siglec-8 ligands in human airways.",

When that extract was subjected to denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), most of the Siglec-8 binding species were very large, hardly entering the gels. Electrophoresis in composite agarose-acrylamide gels designed for separation of mucins (Holden et al. 1971 ) revealed a heterogeneous mixture of proteins all in the high-molecular weight range (>200 kDa to~1 MDa). Based on those findings, Siglec-8 ligands extracted from human trachea were further resolved by sizeexclusion chromatography using Sephacryl S-500 for large size range molecules. The results ( Figure 2 ) reveal a significant resolution of Siglec-8-binding components that eluted differently than the major protein peaks near the excluded or included volumes. Upon composite gel electrophoresis, size-exclusion chromatography fractions were resolved into three major size classes that, based on relative electrophoretic mobility, were designated based on their apparent molecular weights as S8-1M (~1 MDa), S8-600K (~600 kDa) and S8-250K (~250 kDa). Fractions highly enriched in S8-1M and Table I ) was probed with Siglec-8-COMP and binding detected with anti-6-His antibody.

Furthermore, a portion of galactose residues in KS may carry a 6-sulfate. Together, this can generate the terminal sialylated sulfated disaccharide (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal) common to the synthetic glycans discovered as Siglec-8 ligands by multiple glycan array studies (Bochner et al. 2005; Campanero-Rhodes et al. 2006; Kiwamoto et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2017) , and in Figure  1D .

Incubating with buffer alone failed to elute any of the ligand. Likewise, incubation with \u03b2-azidoethylglycosides of N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) or 3\u2032sialyl-LacNAc failed to elute ligand. In contrast, incubation with 6\u2032sulfo-3\u2032-sialyl-LacNAc released the majority of ligand from Siglec-8-COMP beads, and a small amount was released with 6-sulfo-3\u2032-sialyl-LacNAc. These data suggest that binding of the purified ligand to the affinity beads was via the Siglec-8 sialoglycan-binding site.",

For each size class, treatment with either enzyme eliminated or greatly diminished Siglec-8 binding upon subsequent electrophoretic resolution, blotting and Siglec-8-Fc overlay ( Figure 5 ). Treatment with the same enzymes left the protein carrier, aggrecan, intact as evidenced by binding of anti-aggrecan antibody (G1/G2 specific). Together, these data indicate that enzymatic removal of sialylated KS chains are responsible for Siglec-8 binding to each ligand size class. Consistent with prior findings (Yu et al. 2017) , treatment with PNGase F to remove N-linked glycans had little effect, whereas mild base treatment (\u03b2-elimination) resulted in disappearance of Siglec-8 binding consistent with the conclusion that Siglec-8binding KS chains are O-linked (Supplementary data, Figure 1 ).",

Keratanase activities were independently determined chemically (by production of reducing ends from commercial KS) and immunochemically: Keratanase I activity on Siglec-8 ligands was confirmed by gain of binding of monoclonal antibody BKS-1 (Akhtar et al. 2008 ) that detects keratanase I-generated KS stubs (GlcNAc-6-sulfate termini). Keratanase II activity was confirmed by loss of binding of monoclonal antibody 5D4 (Caterson et al. 1983 ) that detects Figure 2 ) and fractions corresponding to S8-1M, S8-600K and S8-250K separately combined for affinity purification.

Keratanase I pretreatment significantly reduced subsequent Siglec-8-Fc binding to both cartilage and submucosal glands, and keratanase II treatment completely eliminated binding. We conclude that all human airway Siglec-8 ligands detectable by lectin Siglec-8-Fc overlay are sialylated KS proteoglycans. Human trachea aggrecan but not bovine articular cartilage aggrecan expresses Siglec-8-binding sialylated KS chains Based on the requirement of sialic acid \u03b12-3 linked to a 6-sulfated galactose for binding (Propster et al. 2016) , and the requirement for GlcNAc-6-sulfation for KS chain elongation (Funderburgh 2002) , we propose that Siglec-8-binding determinants on aggrecan are KS chains with the terminal disulfated trisaccharide structure Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal\u03b21-4[6 S]GlcNAc. This is a minor but well-established structural KS terminus in vertebrates including KS from abundant sources such as human and bovine cornea and articular cartilage (Brown et al. 1994 (Brown et al. , 1998 Lauder et al. 1995 Lauder et al. , 1997 Funderburgh 2000) . To test the distribution of Siglec-8-binding determinants on other sources of aggrecan, the purified human Siglec-8 ligand S8-1M was compared with commercially obtained bovine articular cartilage. For comparable amounts of anti-aggrecan immunoreactivity human S8-1M robustly bound Siglec-8-Fc, whereas binding to bovine aggrecan was essentially absent (Figure 7, lane 1) . To test the potential of CS chains on aggrecan to support or block Siglec-8 binding, S8-1M and bovine aggrecan were treated with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) prior to electrophoretic resolution and blotting. ChABC treatment shifted the migration position of S8-1M and increased Siglec-8 binding (Figure 7 , lane 2). In contrast, ChABC had little effect on commercial bovine aggrecan but revealed a very minor Siglec-8-binding component that did not co-migrate with anti-aggrecan binding. Siglec-8 binding was eliminated by treatment with keratanase, either alone or after treatment of ChABC. Consistent with these findings, pretreatment of tissue sections of human trachea with ChABC resulted in equal (cartilage) or increased (submucosal glands) binding of Siglec-8-Fc (Figure 8 ). After ChABC treatment, subsequent treatment with keratanase completely eliminated Siglec-8 binding.",

Pooled S8-250K fractions from three consecutive Sephacryl S-500 size-exclusion runs were loaded repeatedly onto a Siglec-8-COMP affinity column, the column was washed each time and the bound ligand was salt-eluted as in Figure 3 . After reloading the flow-through four times, most of the S8-250K in the sample had been affinity purified. Eluted fractions from the affinity chromatography runs were pooled, a portion of the combined fractions was subjected to mass spectrometric proteomics ( Figure 4 ) and another portion was used to test biological activity. Matched experimental and control samples were prepared by treating equal portions of purified S8-250K on ice with or without addition of 6 mM sodium periodate for 30 min, then both samples with excess glycerol (300 mM) followed by 10 mM sodium borohydride on ice for 30 min. Cold mild periodate treatment results in selective oxidation of sialic acid glycerol (C7-C9) side chains and completely abrogates Siglec-8 binding ( Figure 10A ). Freshly isolated human peripheral blood eosinophils were cultured overnight with interleukin 5 (IL-5) to activate them, then for an additional 24 h with equal portions of intact or oxidized S8-250K. The oxidized ligand had no effect, whereas the intact ligand significantly increased human eosinophil apoptosis ( Figure 10B ). Although other siglecs are expressed on eosinophils, the ability of a ligand purified by Siglec-8 affinity chromatography to induce eosinophil apoptosis suggests the response is via Siglec-8 binding.",

            "text": "Most of the members of the siglec family of sialic acid-binding proteins (13 of 14 in humans) are expressed on subsets of immune cells and are believed to be immune regulatory, either inhibiting or activating depending on the particular siglec and cellular context (Macauley et al. 2014; Varki et al. 2017 ). Many siglecs carry ITIM and/or ITIM-like domain(s) on their intracellular C-terminus, implicating a role in inhibitory immune regulation. This implication is supported by experiments using human immune cells and animal models (Nutku et al. 2003; von Gunten et al. 2005; Yokoi et al. 2008; Cho et al. 2010; McMillan et al. 2013) , indicating that engagement of certain siglecs results in immune cell apoptosis or other events associated with immune inhibition (e.g., blocking of immune mediator release). Presumably, immune cells that carry siglecs on their surface come into contact with optimal sialoglycan ligands on immune target tissues resulting in transmembrane signals that initiate immune inhibition (Schleimer et al. 2016 ). This scenario is particularly well established in the case of Siglec-8 on the surface of eosinophils and mast cells, where experimental treatment with anti-Siglec-8 antibodies or synthetic multivalent 6\u2032-sulfated sialoglycan polymers results in \u03b22-integrin and reactive oxygen species- Fig. 9 . ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1) treatment of human airway Siglec-8 ligands shifts their electrophoretic migration. Siglec-8 ligands were extracted from human trachea, purified by sequential size exclusion followed by Siglec-8 affinity chromatography and subjected to ChABC, aggrecanase or both enzymes. Samples were resolved on 1.5% acrylamide, 2% agarose composite gels, blotted to PVDF membranes and probed with precomplexed Siglec-8-Fc or antiaggrecan antibody (7D4) as indicated.

Fig. 10 . Purified human tracheal Siglec-8 ligand induces human eosinophil apoptosis. Siglec-8 ligands were extracted from human trachea and purified by size-exclusion chromatography followed by Siglec-8 affinity chromatography. A portion of purified S8-250K was treated with cold periodate to selectively oxidize the glycerol sidearm of its sialic acid followed by sodium borohydride reduction (negative control). An equal portion was incubated without periodate and treated with sodium borohydride (intact ligand). Oxidized and intact S8-250K were dialyzed against RPMI medium and added at equal concentrations to freshly isolated primary human eosinophils. After 24 h in culture, eosinophil apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry. (A) Oxidized and intact S8-250 K were electrophoretically resolved on a composite agarose-acrylamide gel, blotted to PVDF membranes. Replicate blots were probed with Siglec-8-Fc to reveal Siglec-8 ligands or anti-aggrecan antibody (7D4). Lanes: (1) untreated S8-250K; (2) periodate oxidized and reduced S8-250K; (3) reduced S8-250K (intact ligand). (B) After isolation and overnight interleukin 5 (IL-5) priming, human eosinophils were incubated with equal portions of oxidized and intact S8-250K and apoptosis was assessed 18-24 h later. Results are expressed relative to untreated eosinophils, which had average apoptosis of 42 \u00b1 5% (SEM). Data are displayed as mean and SEM of six replicates performed on three separate primary human eosinophil preparations. dependent apoptosis of activated eosinophils and/or inhibition of immune mediator release by activated mast cells (Nutku-Bilir et al. 2008; Yokoi et al. 2008; Hudson et al. 2009; Carroll et al. 2017 ). This inhibition is believed to be a component of the natural resolution of the immune response, and these findings are a potential basis for anti-inflammatory therapy (Bochner 2016; Kiwamoto et al. 2012) .",

Although mice have a functional paralog, Siglec-F, on their eosinophils, Siglec-8binding ligands are absent from mouse airways (Yu et al. 2017 ) and Siglec-F-dependent apoptosis of mouse eosinophils is quite modest in comparison to that in humans (Mao et al. 2013) .

Prior glycan array binding (Bochner et al. 2005; Schnaar 2016 ) and the custom sialoglycan array data reported here ( Figure  1D ) indicate that Siglec-8 is among the most specific lectins known, binding only to an \u03b12-3 sialic acid when it is bound to a 6-sulfated galactose. On the 610-glycan array of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG, http://www.functionalglycomics.org) and the 125-sialoglycan array tested here ( Figure 1D The molecular basis for this Siglec-8 specificity was determined by NMR structural analysis (Propster et al. 2016) . The sialic acidbinding site, with the sialic acid carboxylate making a salt bridge to R109, is flanked by a secondary binding site (R56, Q59) that makes salt bridge and/or hydrogen bonds to the 6-sulfate on the galactose. Together, these clamp the terminal structure (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal) in place. We propose that since GlcNAc residues in KS disaccharides are uniformly 6-sulfated (Lauder et al. 1995; Brown et al. 1998; Seko et al. 2003) , that the sialylated disulfated trisaccharide (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal\u03b21-4[6 S]GlcNAc) on KS is a key binding component for Siglec-8. Comparisons of Siglec-8 binding to the 6\u2032-sulfated and 6,6\u2032-disulfated forms of sialyl Lewis X (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S] Gal\u03b21-4[Fuc\u03b11-3]GlcNAc; Neu5Ac\u03b12-3[6 S]Gal\u03b21-4[Fuc\u03b11-3][6 S] GlcNAc) by array binding (Campanero-Rhodes et al. 2006 ) and NMR titration (Propster et al. 2016 ) revealed only a modest effect of the additional sulfate on the GlcNAc residue. Isolation of intact KS chains from human airways and comparison of Siglec-8-binding and nonbinding species may reveal further subtlety or complexity in endogenous Siglec-8-binding determinants.",

However, glycan array binding has consistently shown that fucosylated and nonfucosylated versions of the same glycan (having a terminal sialylated 6\u2032-sulfated galactose) bind Siglec-8. On the current array ( Figure 1D ), Siglec-8-COMP bound somewhat better to the fucosylated form, whereas on the CFG array the reverse was true (Yu et al. 2017) . Isolation of endogenous Siglec-8-binding KS chains will be required to resolve the potential presence and role of fucose in Siglec-8 binding.",

Nonetheless, the discovery of aggrecan, a KS (and CS) proteoglycan as the major detected protein carrier of Siglec ligands remains surprising, even though aggrecan genetic polymorphism has been associated with asthma (Vaillancourt et al. 2012) . Although aggrecan is abundant in cartilage, its presence in submucosal glands is not well established, and exposure of eosinophils and mast cells to endogenous Siglec-8 ligands likely occurs on the airway surface rather than within the cartilage layer. The hypothesis that an unusual isoform of human aggrecan binds Siglec-8 is supported by the near absence of binding to purified bovine articular cartilage aggrecan (Figure 7) . Furthermore, during enrichment of Siglec-8-binding ligands by affinity chromatography, aggrecan was not similarly enriched as detected by anti-aggrecan binding (data not shown). We conclude that there is a subpopulation of aggrecan glycoforms capable of binding Siglec-8, whereas other glycoforms from human airway and bovine articular cartilage fail to bind Siglec-8. In accordance with terminology we proposed to distinguish lectin-binding glycoforms of common proteins (Taylor et al. 2017) , the aggrecan glycoforms that bind Siglec-8 may be designated aggrecan S8L to distinguish them from aggrecan glycoforms that fail to bind Siglec-8.",

Although the smaller proteoglycans may include proteolytic fragments, the high-confidence C-terminal peptides identified on S8-250K ( Figure 4, Table 1 ) suggest that may not be the case. Interestingly, whereas S8-1M migration on composite gel electrophoresis increased after ChABC treatment (without losing Siglec-8 binding, Figure 7) , the migration of S8-250K was unchanged (data not shown). It is possible that migration on composite gel electrophoresis reflects differentially spliced, differentially glycosylated and/ or proteolytically cleaved forms, as has been proposed for brain aggrecan isoforms (Virgintino et al. 2009) . A major remaining question is whether aggrecan S8L in any form is expressed in submucosal glands and on the airway, or whether some other sialylated KS proteoglycan is produced in the submucosal glands. In either case, we conclude that unusual subclasses of sialylated KS proteoglycans are major Siglec-8-binding components on human airways and may function in the control of eosinophilic and mast cell-mediated inflammation.",

SDS-PAGE was performed using NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris precast polyacrylamide gels with SeeBlue Plus2 molecular weight markers (Thermo Fisher). Immunoblotting was performed after transfer to PVDF membranes using alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-6x-His monoclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher) detected using Vector Red (Vector Laboratories). Sialoglycan-binding specificity was tested by incubating Siglec-8-COMP on a 135-glycan slide-printed array containing 125 sialoglycans and 10 neutral glycans (Li et al. 2017) (Supplementary data, Table 1 ). Binding was detected by washing and incubating with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-His antibody (Qiagen 35310).",

To generate a matched positive and negative control, a portion of S8-250K was treated with cold periodate to selectively cleave sialic acid (Neu5Ac) glycerol side chains (Reuter et al. 1989 ) and abolish Siglec-8 binding ( Figure 10A ) and then with sodium borohydride to selectively reduce the resulting aldehyde to an unreactive hydroxyl group. Equal aliquots of purified S8-250K were treated with or without 6 mM sodium periodate for 30 min on ice in the dark. Glycerol (0.3 M) was then added followed by 10 mM sodium borohydride for 30 min on ice. The oxidized (negative control) and intact S8-250K (test sample) were dialyzed extensively against HEPESbuffered RPMI (Thermo Fisher 72400120) containing penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL). Dialyzed samples were sterilized (0.22-\u03bcm filter) and stored frozen prior to use.Written informed consent for blood donation (up to 180 mL) was obtained using an institutional review board-approved protocol at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Eosinophils were purified from peripheral blood using density gradient centrifugation, erythrocyte hypotonic lysis and CD16 immunomagnetic negative selection (Miltenyi Biotech, San Diego, CA), as previously described (Hudson et al. 2009 ). Purity and initial viability were consistently >95%, as determined by flow cytometry and 4\u2032-6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) exclusion (Thermo Fisher). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and antibiotics with 30 ng/mL recombinant human IL-5 (R&D Systems) for 24 h.
