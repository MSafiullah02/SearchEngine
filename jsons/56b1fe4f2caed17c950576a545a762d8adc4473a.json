The active form of the enzyme is a homodimer with each subunit consisting of three structural domains. Domains I and II, hosting the complete catalytic machinery, constitute the N-terminal chymotrypsin-like folding scaffold and connect to the extra C-terminal domain III by a long loop. Previously, the domain III-truncated enzyme was demonstrated to fold independently into an intact chymotrypsin-like fold, but it showed no enzyme activity. To further delineate the structurefunction relationships of the domain III and the long loop, we generated some truncated and mutated M pro forms bearing various combinations of the loop with other structural parts of the enzyme. Their conformational and association properties were investigated in detail. Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) measurements revealed that these fragments could fold independently. The secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of these mixtures were monitored by CD, fluorescence spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation. However, no enzyme activity was observed for any mutant or mixtures. These observations indicate that the covalent linkage between the chymotrypsin like and the extra domain is essential for enzymatic activity of the main coronavirus protease and for the integrity of its quaternary structure.",

The N-terminal Domains I (residues 899) and II (residues 100183) have an anti-parallel b-barrel structure with a chymotrypsinlike folding scaffold. The C-terminal domain III (residues 200306) has five a-helices arranged into a globular cluster that is connected to Domain II by a long loop (residues 184199). The SARS-CoV M pro has a catalytic CysHis dyad, instead of the SerHisAsp triad of chymotrypsin. The active centre is located in the interface between Domains I and II. The functional role of domain III but not the loop that links domain III and domain (I \u00fe II) has been investigated intensively (8, 10, 11) .",

However, this is predictable because a seventh helix was deleted in M pro D\u00f0297\u00c0306\u00de (Fig. 1B) . Both M pro III and M pro loop\u00feIII displayed far-ultraviolet (Far-UV) CD spectra with the features of a-helical polypeptides, with minimal values of negative ellipticity at around 208 and 222 nm. In contrast, M pro \u00f0I\u00feII\u00de and M pro \u00f0I\u00feII\u00de\u00feloop were characteristic for low a-helix and high b-strand contents, as expected. In aqueous solution and at neutral pH, the M pro III and M pro loop\u00feIII adopted $48 and 71% helicity, respectively. On the other hand, M pro \u00f0I\u00feII\u00de and M pro \u00f0I\u00feII\u00de\u00feloop assumed mainly b-strand structures of 33 and 37%, respectively. These results suggest that the overall structure was not destroyed by truncations. This result was also observed in Shi's study, they found that each fragment (I \u00fe II and III) can fold independently (3) . As shown in Table I , the secondary structural characteristics of Mixtures 1 or 3 are more similar to M pro D\u00f0297\u00c0306\u00de than to the WT. In contrast, a considerable difference in the far-UV CD spectra was observed in Mixture 2 (Fig. 2) . These CD data indicate that there are secondary structure differences between the nicked and intact proteins.",

The enzyme precipitated at high temperature and the thermal denaturation was irreversible. The melting profiles are shown in Supplementary  Fig. 2S . While two distinct transitions were observed around 49.2 and 59.2 C in the melting profile of the Mixture 1; 49.5 and 62.8 C in the Mixture 2, 46.5 and 58.6 C in the Mixture 3, only one large transition was observed around 53.9 C in the profile of WT. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that the transition proceeds in a three-state fashion with indication of independent behaviour by either of the domains in the mixtures. Among the truncated SARS-CoV M pro , the C terminally truncated protein had a significantly lower T m (50.2 for M pro \u00f0I\u00feII\u00de and 52.2 for M pro \u00f0I\u00feII\u00de\u00feloop ) than did the N terminally truncated one (57.7 C and 79.2 C for M pro III and 61.2 C for M pro loop\u00feIII ). The observation is an indication that the catalytic domain is intrinsically less stable and that it derives a significant fraction of its stabilization energy from its interactions with domain III through the linker. The T m value for WT was 53.9 C ($54), which is a little higher than that of M pro \u00f0I\u00feII\u00de (50.2 C) and M pro \u00f0I\u00feII\u00de\u00feloop (52.2 C). These results are consistent with the previous report that the C-terminal domain is involved in stabilizing the N-terminal catalytic domain of SARS-CoV M pro (10) . Two transitions with the midpoint temperatures at 57.7 and 79.2 C upon thermal unfolding were also demonstrated in M pro III . Moreover, one transition temperature for M pro D\u00f0297\u00c0306\u00de was determined to be 68.2 C, which is higher than that of WT (53.9 C). Further characterization of these transitions is needed to address what structure is attributed to the unfolding, when narrowed down to the area of a single a-helix in M pro III and M pro D\u00f0297\u00c0306\u00de .",

The present results on M pro fragments further defined our earlier studies that domain III acts to stabilize the catalytic N-terminal domain (I\u00feII). Furthermore, the different SARS-CoV M pro -complementing fragment systems described herein were used to probe the structural role of the loop. We confirmed that the covalent linkage between domains (I\u00feII) and (III) is essential, which suggests that the long loop might stabilize the C-terminal domain. It is likely that some critical structural stabilizing interactions are conserved in the loop-retaining fragments with respect to those present in the natural and longer SARS-CoV fragment. Because of this, M pro \u00f0I\u00feII\u00de\u00feloop displays a higher content of b-sheets, which is its major secondary structure, than does M pro \u00f0I\u00feII\u00de , and M pro loop\u00feIII instead displays more helicity than M pro III . Examining crystal structures of M pro reveals that residues around 187 have interactions with residues around 40 and 54 of N-terminal domain, and residues around 198 have interactions with residues around 240 of C-terminal domain. Thus, the truncations we did very likely affected the folding and stability of the domains.
